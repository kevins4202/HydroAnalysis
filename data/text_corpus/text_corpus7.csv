35,prediction of short i e aquifer is near or at saturated conditions and long time i e aquifer is not near or at saturated conditions baseflow recession characteristics at ungauged stream locations is a current challenge that has been primarily addressed by empirical approaches that relate these characteristics to basin attributes however the performance of these models is often only fair with coefficient of determination values ranging from 0 5 to 0 7 in this study we propose a hybrid physical and machine learning approach to predict the long and short time baseflow recession characteristics at ungauged stream locations this approach is compared to a machine learning method random forest regression that relates baseflow recession characteristics to basin attributes in 582 basins across the western and eastern united states the new approach resulted in lower median and inner quartile ranges iqr of absolute normalized errors in predicting long time baseflow recession characteristics western 23 iqr 32 eastern 30 iqr 39 compared to estimates of those properties based on random forest regressions western 27 iqr 34 eastern 38 iqr 50 for the short time baseflow recession characteristics the hybrid approach resulted in substantially lower median errors and iqr values western 79 iqr 143 eastern 83 iqr 140 compared to estimates from random forest regressions western 1 577 iqr 8 887 eastern 341 iqr 2 154 in addition this approach identified four major regions in the western united states and three in the eastern united states where the baseflow recession characteristics are mostly constant and these characteristics only vary based on the geometric properties of aquifers lastly the inter basin variability of the baseflow recession characteristics was not found to be strongly related to metrics measuring interstorm arrival periods average number of storms and average length of storms keywords prediction in ungauged stream locations low streamflow baseflow recession machine learning data availability the data used in this study is available from eng 2023 10 5066 p9xi9f2q 1 introduction streamflow consists primarily of two components outflow that occurs in the shallow soil layers in direct response to storm events and baseflow also referred to as low flows which is outflow from an aquifer without the influence of storm flow effects baseflow is important in many hydrological analysis applications providing basin wide estimates of aquifer characteristics brutsaert and nieber 1977 brutsaert and lopez 1998 eng and brutsaert 1999 improving prediction of low and drought flow characteristics e g eng and milly 2007 and estimating groundwater trends brutseart 2008 in addition baseflow is a significant component of streamflow in water balance models and lumped hydrologic models such as the soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 and the precipitation runoff modeling system leavesley et al 1983 markstrom et al 2015 to characterize baseflow baseflow recession characteristics storage outflow behaviors and streamflow recession portions of hydrographs i e sequences of consecutive streamflow values that decrease over time in the absence of precipitation referred to as recession sequences hereafter are often analyzed e g brutsaert and nieber 1977 wahl and wahl 1988 1995 rumsey et al 2015 predictions of baseflow recession characteristics are useful at ungauged stream locations however methods to estimate baseflow require streamflow values and or chemical data to be available at the location of interest a common approach that is used to address this problem is to use empirical models that relate baseflow characteristics to basin attributes such as drainage area precipitation and soil information e g nathan and mcmahon 1992 krakauer and temimi 2011 beck et al 2013 sánchez murillo et al 2015 reddyvaraprasad et al 2020 the results of these studies however have shown mixed results some of which are summarized in this paper for example krakauer and temimi 2011 used stepwise linear regression for 61 basins across the conterminous united states to associate the baseflow recession characteristics with basin attribute predictors which resulted in a coefficient of determination r 2 of roughly 0 57 for the pacific northwest in the united states sánchez murillo et al 2015 found fair relationships among the baseflow recession characteristics and basin attributes with an r 2 of 0 57 reddyvaraprasad et al 2020 used a drainage area normalization of recession flow characteristics at geographically close locations that had observed streamflow values they found that 12 of their study basins had nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 values greater than 0 5 i e more than half the variability explained in australia nathan mcmahon 1992 used multiple linear regression to relate baseflow recession characteristics to basin attributes which resulted in r 2 values from 0 67 to 0 74 beck et al 2013 used artificial neural networks to predict baseflow recession characteristics using basin attributes which yielded an r 2 value of 0 72 our objective in this study is to present a novel approach which uses both machine learning and physical baseflow models to predict baseflow recession characteristics at ungauged stream locations the predictions from this combined approach are then compared to those from a machine learning approach random forest regression rf to relate baseflow recession characteristics to basin attributes 2 study area and data in this study data from 300 u s geological survey streamflow gaging stations in the western united states fig 1a and 282 in the eastern united states are used fig 1b these selected stations monitor relatively natural basins and they are a subset of the approximately 9000 flow gaging stations in the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow gages ii falcone 2011 database natural condition i e minimally impacted

provided in the u s geological survey national water information system u s geological survey 2016 3 methodology 3 1 hybrid physical and machine learning approach 3 1 1 estimating the long and short time baseflow recession characteristics at gauged locations the first step in the modeling approach is to estimate long and short time baseflow recession characteristics at all basins using a physical baseflow model see flow diagram in fig 2 for several solutions to various kinds of idealized unconfined aquifers with differing geometries assumptions and boundary conditions hall 1968 brutsaert and nieber 1977 rupp and selker 2005a 2006 provide the physical basis for conceptualizing aquifer discharge into a channel as a linear or nonlinear reservoir which can be represented by the following 1 q c s n where q is the aquifer discharge s is the volume of aquifer storage and c and n are treated as constants at the scale of the individual recession events n 1 for a linear reservoir and n 1 for nonlinear reservoirs eq 1 combined with the continuity equation p et q ds dt where p is the precipitation 0 and et is the evapotranspiration 0 yields the following for linear and nonlinear models respectively 2 q q 0 e c 1 t for n 1 3 q q 0 1 c 2 t n 1 n for n 1 where c 1 and c 2 are constant for individual recession events and q0 is the aquifer discharge at time t equal to zero for n 1 it is very difficult to determine a consistent method to identify the beginning of each recession so brutsaert and nieber 1977 proposed a time derivative to solve this problem which yields the following 4 d q d t a q b where a n n 1 c 2 q 0 1 n n referred to as the baseflow recession characteristic and b 2 n 1 n are constant for individual recession events brutsaert and nieber 1977 proposed two forms of eq 4 for long time baseflow recessions one for linear and the other for nonlinear selecting the most appropriate form of eq 4 is highly dependent on the methods used to estimate the a and b values several studies e g eng and brutsaert 1999 eng and milly 2007 sánchez murillo et al 2015 tashie et al 2020 have found that the linear solution can adequately represent recession sequences using a conventional approach of using all available recession sequences known as the cloud approach however studies e g shaw and riha 2012 stoelzle et al 2012 dralle et al 2017 that have used event based approaches which analyze individual recession sequences have found that the long time response is highly nonlinear in this study the cloud and the event based approaches are not examined instead a smaller subset of recession sequences is used than what is used in the cloud based approach so the response of these groups of recession sequences are assumed to be more nonlinear than linear this long time baseflow recession assumes that the free surface of the aquifer is curvilinear i e it resembles an inverse incomplete beta function this assumption is applicable only after long times have passed typically from a few days to a month depending on the size of the basin and it is violated when the aquifer is near saturated conditions at short times brutsaert and nieber 1977 propose that the a and b for long time baseflow recessions for the nonlinear model are the following 5 a l o n g κ l o n g l a 1 5 6 b l o n g 1 5 where κlong is the long time aquifer hydraulic property 4 8038 k 0 5 f α 1 5 with dimensions of length time 1 2 k is the hydraulic conductivity length time f is the drainable porosity dimensionless α is the fraction of the basin underlain by aquifers contributing to streamflow dimensionless a is the drainage area of the basin length2 and the value of 4 8038 derives from the exact solution by boussinesq 1903 1904 to complement the long time baseflow recession behavior since it is not valid when the aquifer is near saturation brutsaert and nieber 1977 propose a short time recession behavior with the following a and b values 7 a s h o r t κ s h o r t 1 l 2 8 b s h o r t 3 where κshort is the short time aquifer hydraulic property 1 1334 k f d 3 time length4 d is the depth of the aquifer length and the value of 1 1334 derives from the exact solution by polubarinova kochina 1962 this short time recession behavior assumes that the aquifer divide is infinitely far away from the channel the κlong and κshort are typically derived using along and ashort values that are calculated using streamflow values detailed in the following paragraphs a and l the k f d or α values can be back derived if some of these variables are known for the aquifer e g brutsaert and lopez 1998 a substantial amount of literature exists on different approaches used to determine the along and ashort values using recession sequences identified from time series of streamflow values henceforth referred to as as long and as short where the s superscript denotes that these values are calculated using daily flow values monitored at streamflow gaging stations brutsaert and nieber 1977 ando et al 1986 tallaksen 1995 brutsaert and lopez 1998 eng and brutsaert 1999 rupp and selker 2005b 2006 brutsaert 2008 krakauer and termimi 2011 shaw and riha 2012 stoelzle et al 2012 sánchez murillo et al 2015 thomas et al 2015 chen and krajewski 2016 cheng et al 2016 dralle et al 2017 roques et al 2017 reddyvaraprasad et al 2020 tashie et al 2020 yang et al 2020 as a result there is no agreed upon consistent approach to determine these recession characteristic values in this study we attempt to select best recommendations from these studies where appropriate refining existing approaches to best estimate the as parameters is not the focus of this study instead this study provides a template where alternative approaches to determine as values can be interchanged with what the combined modeling approach used in this study steps 1 1 to 1 3 fig 2 in this study we do not employ the cloud envelope approach suggested by brutsaert nieber 1977 the cloud envelope approach uses all recession sequences including ones that may not have been generated by a storm event and fits envelopes to the right most and bottom of this cloud of recession sequences in this study we use a smaller subset of recession sequences to determine generalized values of as long and as short and fit a non linear function based on minimizing errors to this group of recessions in addition analyzing groups of recession sequences is chosen over single sequences to avoid the problem of determining as long and as short values based on a few points such as the recommended four point minimum by dralle et al 2017 many basins have few if any recession sequences in excess of 30 days in this study we also assume that the short and long time recession behaviors are present in the recession sequences in order to minimize the impact of contaminated baseflow values by storm events and evapotranspiration effects which violate the assumptions of the baseflow model we remove a fixed number of days from all recession sequences and use the largest magnitude recession sequences that have been found to be associated with minimal evapotranspiration step 1 1 fig 2 involves identification of all recession sequences for every streamflow gaging station based on the following the start of these sequences begins one day after the peaks occur in hydrographs plots of streamflow values versus time and ends when there are no decreases over time in streamflow values some studies use an additional criterion concerning the concavity of the recession e g yang et al 2020 to identify the end of recession sequences however the concavity criterion uses second derivatives which are sensitive to small errors in streamflow values as a result we adopt the criteria of no decreases to identify the end of recession sequences the effects from storm events can be present in the measured streamflow values several days after a peak streamflow event occurs it is important to minimize the impact of these contaminated baseflow values from all recession sequences by removing them from further analysis brutsaert nieber 1977 recommend removing the first five days after the peak streamflow value to minimize the impact of isolated precipitation events occurring on any part of the basin brutsaert 2008 further refines this recommendation by having a variable number of days removed four days after major storm events and three days for all others in other current work such as in tashie et al 2020 and yang et al 2020 two and three days were removed respectively there is little consensus in the literature on the number of days to remove from the initial recession sequences so we use the initial conservative recommendation by brutsaert nieber 1977 of removing five days to minimize the impact of storm flow effects a variety of methods exist in the literature to remove recession sequences from analysis based on the magnitude of the peak streamflow associated with these sequences e g biswal and marani 2010 ye et al 2014 these approaches seek to remove recession sequences that do not substantially generate a groundwater response dralle et al 2017 recommend using a less restrictive variable threshold approach to removing recession sequences in this study a group of the largest 20 of recession sequences based on the starting q value that includes at least 10 days is used to estimate the as long and as short values for each basin these recession sequences are chosen because they are likely to generate a groundwater response and these sequences are less impacted by evapotranspiration effects shaw and riha 2012 step 1 2 fig 2 step 1 3 fig 2 applies an automated approach to provide a non subjective fit of the two lines with slope equal to 1 5 and 3 to the group of recession sequences on the log10 dq dt s and log10 q s plots where the subscript s denotes that these values are calculated from streamflow values this approach is similar to a fixed slope piecewise linear regression however these two lines are joined at a hinge point with the line with slope equal to 1 5 on the left and the one with slope equal to 3 on the right x point on fig 2 step 1 3 the following process is used to obtain the optimal placement of these lines 1 a 1000 by 1000 grid spanning the range of log10 dq dt s and log10 q s values is placed onto the plot 2 the hinge point of the two lines is placed on an intersecting point on the grid starting at the lowest log10 dq dt s and log10 q s values 3 a root mean square error rmse is calculated from the errors between the lines and the log10 dq dt s values for each log10 q s value using 9 r m s e j 1 j lo g 10 d q d t s j lo g 10 d q d t b 3 j 2 i 1 i lo g 10 d q d t s i lo g 10 d q d t b 1 5 i 2 j i where i is the total number of observations to the left of the hinge point j is the total number of observations to the right of the hinge point log10 dq dt b 3 are the log10 dq dt s values calculated from a line with slope equal to 3 placed through the hinge point and log10 dq dt b 1 5 are the log10 dq dt s values calculated from a line with slope equal to 1 5 placed through the hinge point 4 steps 2 and 3 are repeated for every intersecting point on the grid and 5 the optimal placement of the lines is associated with the smallest rmse value from this optimal placement the as long and as short values are determined for each basin to evaluate whether the group of recession sequences are well represented by the short and long time baseflow recession characteristics an r 2 value is calculated based on the optimal placement of the lines with slope equal to 3 and 1 5 for each basin 3 1 2 determining regions with similar baseflow recession characteristics step 2 fig 2 involves the determination of regions of similar baseflow recession characteristics proximal basins most likely will share similar aquifer hydraulic properties brutsaert and nieber 1977 brutsaert and lopez 1998 eng and brutsaert 1999 brutsaert and nieber 1977 demonstrate that the hydraulic properties κs long and κs short eqs 5 and 7 where the superscript s denotes these values are associated with the group of recession sequences for a single basin are roughly constant among geographically close basins so as long and as short are functions only of the geometric properties of the aquifer l a 1 5 and 1 l 2 an approach in the literature does not exist however for determining the geographic extent of these areas to identify the regions of similar baseflow recession characteristics and their geographic extent in the western and eastern united states we use a k means clustering approach within each region based on z scores of location latitude and longitude and hydraulic property κs long step 2 1 fig 2 for each basin the κs long values are determined from rearranging eq 5 to solve for κs long i e κs long l a 1 5 as long the initial clusters of basins identified by the k means approach for the western and eastern united states are visually inspected aggregated disaggregated and adjusted as necessary based on the three z scores in step 2 2 fig 2 two regional relationships are formed among all basins for each cluster a power law relationship between the ar long and l a 1 5 values and another one between the ar short and 1 l 2 values i e ar long κr long l a 1 5 ν and ar short κr short 1 l 2 ω where the r superscript denotes a regional value across all basins in each cluster and ν and ω are regional constants the ν and ω values are checked to ascertain if their values are close to one and r 2 values are computed for each cluster 3 1 3 classifying and predicting baseflow recession characteristics at ungauged stream locations application of water balance models lumped hydrologic models and empirical low flow models to ungauged stream locations requires basin scale characterization of the baseflow recession characteristics so it is important to have a method that can predict these characteristics without observed chemical and or streamflow information step 3 fig 2 involves the development of a method to assign an ungauged stream location to one of the clusters of similar baseflow recession characteristics in this study we use random forest classification a commonly used machine learning approach step 3 1 fig 2 the r programming package randomforest liaw and wiener 2018 is used in this study random forest is chosen in this study because it has been shown to have superior predictive capabilities over other statistical methods such as multivariate adaptive regression splines regression trees bagging trees logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis prasad et al 2006 cutler et al 2007 and it has been used in previous baseflow studies e g singh et al 2019 briefly rf is an ensemble classification and regression tree method breiman 2001 random forest models typically are formed from hundreds to thousands of individual trees for each tree a random subset of predictor variables and associated predictands is selected to form the model furthermore at each split in the tree a random set of predictors is chosen out of all candidate predictors to reduce the correlation among trees in the forest a final prediction in rf is achieved by inputting the predictors to each tree in this study a similar approach by eng et al 2017 is used to develop two multi class classification rf models one for the western united states and one for the eastern united states all basins are classified into their corresponding cluster name identified previously in step 2 fig 2 and used as the predictand one hundred randomly generated bootstrapped calibration 90 and validation 10 data sets are generated for both regions eastern and western united states for each calibration data set an initial multi class classification rf model is formed using all 181 basin attributes to identify the 20 most significant basin attributes based on the gini index cutler et al 2007 using this reduced set of basin attributes the parameters of the multi class classification rf model are mtry which is the number of randomly selected predictors to use at each split in the trees and ntrees which is the number of trees to optimize the fit of the multi class classification rf model a gridded parameter search is implemented mtry values range from 5 to 20 in increments of 5 and similarly ntrees values range from 100 to 2000 in increments of 100 the optimal values of mtry and ntrees parameters were chosen based on maximizing the weighted macro f1 statistic grandini et al 2020 the final multi class classification rf is formed using the optimal mtry and ntrees values the validation data set is used in this final model to make class predictions a weighted macro f1 statistic is calculated based on all the predictions from the 100 validation data sets the weighted macro f1 statistic ranges in value from 0 to 1 1 for a perfect model and this metric measures the overall accuracy of classification models from the multi class classification rf models predictions of cluster membership from the 100 validation data sets are made for all locations step 3 2 fig 2 the ar long κr long l a 1 5 ν and ar short κr short 1 l 2 ω relationships of the appropriate cluster are then applied using the l and a values of a basin to obtain an estimate of the as long and as short values ae long and ae short respectively where the e superscript denotes an estimated value step 4 1 fig 2 these values are then plotted against the as long and as short values the median and inner quartile range iqr of the absolute values of the normalized residuals in percent are reported for overall performance step 4 2 fig 2 the absolute normalized residuals are calculated as 10 ε a l o n g s h o r t e a l o n g s h o r t s a l o n g s h o r t s 100 3 2 machine learning approach random forest regression models are used to directly estimate as long and as short values at ungauged stream locations using the 180 basin attributes where the a and l values are replaced with either l a 1 5 or 1 l 2 for the as long and as short models respectively four regional models are formed in this study two as long and as short for the western united states and two for the eastern united states the tuning parameters are the same as the multi class classification rf and the same method is used to determine their optimal values except that the root mean square error is used to determine the optimal parameters model performance is measured by percent variance explained the median and iqr of ε 4 results the median and iqr of r 2 values for assessing whether the recession sequences are well represented by the short and long time baseflow recession characteristics were 0 89 iqr 0 12 and 0 94 iqr 0 08 for the western and eastern united states respectively fig 3 the percentage of basins poorly represented r 2 0 60 by the short and long time baseflow recession characteristics was 5 and 2 for the western and eastern united states respectively the median recession lengths were 17 days and 18 days and the iqr were 4 days and 6 days for the eastern and western united states respectively two examples are provided in fig 4 demonstrating a good and a poor fit using methods in step 1 3 on fig 2 for the as long values the hybrid approach resulted in the lowest normalized residual values of 23 iqr 32 and 30 iqr 39 for the western and eastern united states respectively and those from the rf regressions were 27 iqr 34 and 38 iqr 50 for the western and eastern united states respectively fig 5a and c for the as short values the hybrid method resulted in the lowest normalized residual values of 79 iqr 143 and 83 iqr 140 for the western and eastern united states respectively and those from the rf regressions were 1577 iqr 8887 and 341 iqr 2154 for the western and eastern united states respectively fig 5b and 5d for the western and eastern united states the ae long values for the new method do not systematically under or over predict at different ranges of the as long values fig 5a and c the rf regressions tend to over predict at the lowest values of as long values and under predict at the largest as long values fig 5a for the western united states for the eastern united states the rf regressions tend to over predict for the lower half of the as long values fig 5c for the western and eastern united states the ae short values for the hybrid method appear to under predict for the largest as short values fig 5b and 5d the rf regressions substantially over predict for the entire range of the as short values fig 5b and 5d the hybrid method delineated four distinct regions in the western united states and three regions in the eastern united states fig 1 the r 2 values for the regional relationships of ar long κr long l a 1 5 ν and ar short κr short 1 l 2 ω were 0 75 0 78 0 83 and 0 87 for the ar long values and 0 55 0 61 0 76 and 0 84 for the ar short values in the western united states fig 6 for the eastern united states r 2 values were 0 79 0 83 and 0 90 for the ar long values and 0 47 0 73 and 0 73 for the ar short values fig 7 the ν values for all regions were close to a value of one figs 6 and 7 differing at most by 13 which indicates that the κr long values are constant in each of these clusters and only depend on the geometric property of aquifers l a 1 5 similarly the ω values for all regions were close to a value of one figs 6 and 7 differing at most by 16 which indicates that the κr short values are constant in each of these regions and are a function mainly of the geometric property of aquifers 1 l 2 the rf classification models in the hybrid method resulted in weighted macro f1 statistics of 0 88 and 0 70 for the western and eastern united states respectively based on the confusion matrices shown in tables 1 and 2 the most significant predictor variables in the western united states were latitude monthly minimum number of days of measurable precipitation june july and august number of days of measurable precipitation the most significant predictor variables in the eastern united states were latitude average silt and sand content rainfall and runoff factor and estimated runoff in january and february these significant predictors are available from the falcone 2011 and wieczorek et al 2018 databases the optimal tuning parameters for these models were 1000 and 20 for ntrees and mtry respectively for the western united states and 1100 and 20 for the eastern united states for the rf regressions the percent variance explained values for as long were 66 and 69 for the western and eastern united states respectively for the as short values the percent variance explained values were 42 and near zero for the western and eastern united states respectively the most significant predictors of as long were the geometric property of aquifers l a 1 5 latitude relative humidity of the basin and topographic wetness index in the western united states for as short in the western united states the significant predictors were 1 l 2 topographic wetness index and average may temperature for the eastern united states the most significant predictors for as long were l a 1 5 average silt and sand content these significant predictors are available from the databases by falcone 2011 and wieczorek et al 2018 the predictors for as short in the eastern united states were not reported since the percent variance explained was close to zero the optimal ntrees and mtry tuning parameters for the along rf regressions were 800 and 20 for the western united states and 700 and 20 for the eastern united states the optimal ntrees and mtry tuning parameters for the as short rf regressions were 1000 and 20 for the western united states and 1300 and 20 for the eastern united states 5 discussion this study demonstrates that predictions of the baseflow recession characteristic in ungauged stream locations can be improved using the proposed hybrid framework over machine learning methods like random forest however the improvement in predictions of baseflow recession characteristics are based on one set of criteria e g nonlinear model minimum recession lengths analyzing groups of recessions instead of individual recession sequences using a different set of criteria to determine the baseflow recession characteristics at gauged basins fig 2 steps 1 1 to 1 3 could potentially alter the regions and the accuracy of the predictions in the framework as mentioned previously the literature proposes many different criteria with no consensus sensitivity of the framework to different sets of criteria similar to methods used in dralle et al 2017 on calculating the baseflow recession characteristics could be tested however this analysis is outside the scope of this study the work by jachens et al 2020 found that the within basin variations in the short and long time baseflow recession characteristics are significantly related to interstorm arrival period and other storm related features if the interstorm arrival period is a significant driver of the within basin variability in the short and long time baseflow recession characteristics it will be an important driver of inter basin variability in both baseflow recession characteristics in this study the inter basin variability of the short and long time baseflow recession characteristics are not substantially associated with interstorm arrival periods average number of storms and average length of storms since these variables were not present in the top 20 basin attributes in any of the random forest models their absence indicates that they explain little to none of the inter basin variability of the baseflow recession characteristics these findings are not consistent with the findings by jachens et al 2020 for within basin variability of baseflow recession characteristics in this study the mean baseflow recession behavior is examined over at least 10 years of record at all basins so the interstorm arrival periods average number of storms and average length of storms may become more important over shorter time periods such as seasonal to monthly time frames another plausible explanation is that the storm features could appear to be uncorrelated due to the spatial structure of the storm features relative to the inter basin distances other issues related to the analysis are the unbalanced nature of the recession data and the assumption that the recession sequences transition from short to long time baseflow recessions the conventional cloud approach by brutsaert and nieber 1977 mixes numerous recession sequences that do not transition to the long time baseflow recession i e recession sequences generated by small magnitude storm events these types of recession sequences form a large proportion of the points analyzed in cloud approaches which could substantially influence the determination of the short and long time baseflow recession using regression models fit to the entire cloud of data e g vogel and kroll 1992 tashie et al 2020 the use of groups of recession sequences instead of the cloud approach mitigates some of this biasing this bias can be further reduced by using methods of oversampling or undersampling pan et al 2020 however the assumption that recession sequences single event groups and cloud transition from short to long time behaviors is not easily addressed and this assumption is used in many studies e g brutseart and lopez 1998 rupp and selker 2005 2006 this assumption is heavily dependent on the size of the basin since headwater basins can take less than a day to a few days to drain as opposed to larger basins that take several days thus the availability of high frequency subdaily streamflow observations in headwater basins are necessary to test this assumption if short time recession behaviors are present the subdaily streamflow observations at the locations examined in this study are not available so this assumption could not be tested the proposed physical and machine learning approach performs consistently better than the purely machine learning approach tested in this study for predicting long and short time baseflow recession characteristics at ungauged stream locations the performance of rf regressions percent variance explained values of 66 and 69 are comparable to other studies nathan and mcmahon 1992 krakauer and temimi 2011 beck et al 2013 sánchez murillo et al 2015 reddyvaraprasad et al 2020 for predicting long time baseflow recession characteristics using other statistical models such as linear regression and artificial neural networks the performance of rf regressions in predicting short time baseflow recession characteristics however is very poor in both regions tested in this study with substantial over predictions of the true values these previous studies do not report models predicting short time baseflow recession characteristics the difference in predictive performance between as long and as short could be due to the differing amount of streamflow data used to derive these values the amount of streamflow data can vary substantially across basins as can be seen in fig 4 and as a result as short values are more highly variable than as long values the framework presented in this paper provides a viable approach to estimate both as long and as short values at ungauged stream locations and these values can be utilized in lumped hydrologic models and empirical low flow prediction models methods in the literature that use as long and as short values as predictors in empirical approaches substantially improve the predictions of low flow and baseflow characteristics at ungauged stream locations this improvement occurs because these baseflow recession characteristics explain a substantial amount of variability in low flow characteristics however guidance on how as long and as short values are obtained at ungauged stream locations is lacking e g vogel and kroll 1992 the method by eng and milly 2007 requires at a minimum a pair of streamflow measurements on the same streamflow recession to realize improvement in the prediction of 7 day 10 year low streamflows q7 10 the proposed approach in this study presents a method that does not require any streamflow information i e partial miscellaneous or daily streamflow measurements at the ungauged stream location and it only requires aquifer geometric properties i e a and l and the assigned region of similar baseflow recession characteristics brutsaert and nieber 1977 brutsaert and lopez 1998 and eng and brutsaert 1999 demonstrated that geographically close basins share similar aquifer hydraulic properties however these studies were conducted in small regions geographic areas smaller than a medium sized state in the united states such as kansas so they could not address how many of these coherent regions exist and the extent of these regions of similar aquifer hydraulic properties in this study the geographic extent of regions of similar aquifer hydraulic properties spans multiple states in both the western and eastern united states and there are at least four major regions in the western united states and three regions in the eastern united states the difference or variability among regions of similar baseflow recession characteristics in both the western and eastern united states is mainly driven by latitude a climate proxy and not the interstorm metrics this finding indicates that the inter basin variability of baseflow recession characteristics is explained by the synoptic scale circulation patterns that operate on longer time scales than the interstorm effects however if this study analyzed seasonal time series of baseflow recession characteristics instead of the historical means the interstorm metrics could become more important in explaining some of the inter basin variability of these characteristics this driver is consistent with the finding that the majority of the spatial variability of streamflow can be explained by large scale circulation patterns precipitation and evapotranspiration as described in several studies e g redmond and koch 1991 kahya and dracup 1993 wolock and mccabe 1999 bonsal and shabbar 2008 the vast majority of streamflow observations are often made during periods of no precipitation so these observations represent baseflows in the western united states precipitation events are typically not in phase with maximum evapotranspiration periods since precipitation events are largely concentrated during winter e g finkelstein and truppi 1991 and maximum evapotranspiration periods occur generally during summer e g zhang et al 2020 measurable precipitation during summer is another key predictor in the rf classification models for the regions in the western united states which possibly indicates that the timing of precipitation and evapotranspiration relative to one another is an important driver for spatial variability of baseflow recessions dissimilar to the western united states the precipitation events in the eastern united states are in phase with maximum evapotranspiration periods finkelstein and truppi 1991 zhang et al 2020 and the predictors from rf classification models reflect this characteristic in a lack of predictors quantifying the level of overlap of precipitation and evapotranspiration periods these findings are also consistent with the findings for streamflow by wolock and mccabe 1999 the regions defined in this study are for baseflow recession behavior based on the entire historical records for all locations these regions will change if the analysis is performed on a seasonal or monthly basis the incorporation of the evapotranspiration effects on the outflow from aquifers is not addressed in this study the as short values are particularly susceptible to evapotranspiration effects shaw and riha 2012 compared to as long values as can be seen in a few of the noisier regional relationships to the aquifer geometric properties periods of the largest evapotranspiration effects are from june to july in the united states zhang et al 2020 roughly 80 and 83 of the recession sequences analyzed in this study for the western and eastern united states do not occur in june and july so the majority of recession sequences are not concurrent with maximum evapotranspiration however 20 and 17 of the recession sequences in the western and eastern united states respectively occur during periods of large evapotranspiration effects as a result noise may be introduced in calculating as short values in addition the sensitivity of as short values to record length and how these record lengths span wet and dry periods of the climate e g mauget 2003 mccabe and wolock 2014 could influence calculation of as short values an alternative to restricting the types of recession sequences to analyze could be to incorporate evapotranspiration effects into eqs 2 and 3 however this modification is outside the scope of this paper in addition to evapotranspiration effects estimates of aquifer outflow behavior can be confounded by snowmelt in snow dominated basins miller et al 2015 this effect is particularly acute in mountainous areas in the western united states the length of the snowmelt season typically lasts for 40 days in the western united states trujillo and molotch 2014 the start of the snowmelt season typically begins in april and ends in the middle of may trujillo and molotch 2014 in the eastern united states snowmelt effects typically end by may hodgkins and dudley 2006 the percentages of recessions used in this study that occur within the april to may period were 9 and 13 for the western and eastern united states respectively these recessions that occur from april to may are likely contributing to the noisier relationships in this study an alternative method to reduce the impact of snowmelt contaminated baseflows is to exclude them from analysis by limiting selection of recession sequences to periods outside the snowmelt period 6 summary this paper proposes a framework using a physical baseflow model combined with machine learning models to predict short and long time baseflow recession characteristics in ungauged stream locations that are more accurate and precise than using only machine learning methods for the western and eastern united states seven regions where the baseflow recession characteristics are mostly constant four in the western and three in the eastern united states are identified from the application of this framework interstorm effects i e arrival period number of storms and length of storms explain little to none of the inter basin variability of long term baseflow recession characteristics and this variability is better explained by the synoptic scale circulation patterns that operate on longer time scales than the interstorm effects the methodological choices used in this study to derive the baseflow recession characteristics that are used in subsequent steps of the proposed framework represent one way to estimates these values the other numerous methodological choices for determining baseflow recession characteristics from streamflow values needs further exploration on how these characteristics impact

35,prediction of short i e aquifer is near or at saturated conditions and long time i e aquifer is not near or at saturated conditions baseflow recession characteristics at ungauged stream locations is a current challenge that has been primarily addressed by empirical approaches that relate these characteristics to basin attributes however the performance of these models is often only fair with coefficient of determination values ranging from 0 5 to 0 7 in this study we propose a hybrid physical and machine learning approach to predict the long and short time baseflow recession characteristics at ungauged stream locations this approach is compared to a machine learning method random forest regression that relates baseflow recession characteristics to basin attributes in 582 basins across the western and eastern united states the new approach resulted in lower median and inner quartile ranges iqr of absolute normalized errors in predicting long time baseflow recession characteristics western 23 iqr 32 eastern 30 iqr 39 compared to estimates of those properties based on random forest regressions western 27 iqr 34 eastern 38 iqr 50 for the short time baseflow recession characteristics the hybrid approach resulted in substantially lower median errors and iqr values western 79 iqr 143 eastern 83 iqr 140 compared to estimates from random forest regressions western 1 577 iqr 8 887 eastern 341 iqr 2 154 in addition this approach identified four major regions in the western united states and three in the eastern united states where the baseflow recession characteristics are mostly constant and these characteristics only vary based on the geometric properties of aquifers lastly the inter basin variability of the baseflow recession characteristics was not found to be strongly related to metrics measuring interstorm arrival periods average number of storms and average length of storms keywords prediction in ungauged stream locations low streamflow baseflow recession machine learning data availability the data used in this study is available from eng 2023 10 5066 p9xi9f2q 1 introduction streamflow consists primarily of two components outflow that occurs in the shallow soil layers in direct response to storm events and baseflow also referred to as low flows which is outflow from an aquifer without the influence of storm flow effects baseflow is important in many hydrological analysis applications providing basin wide estimates of aquifer characteristics brutsaert and nieber 1977 brutsaert and lopez 1998 eng and brutsaert 1999 improving prediction of low and drought flow characteristics e g eng and milly 2007 and estimating groundwater trends brutseart 2008 in addition baseflow is a significant component of streamflow in water balance models and lumped hydrologic models such as the soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 and the precipitation runoff modeling system leavesley et al 1983 markstrom et al 2015 to characterize baseflow baseflow recession characteristics storage outflow behaviors and streamflow recession portions of hydrographs i e sequences of consecutive streamflow values that decrease over time in the absence of precipitation referred to as recession sequences hereafter are often analyzed e g brutsaert and nieber 1977 wahl and wahl 1988 1995 rumsey et al 2015 predictions of baseflow recession characteristics are useful at ungauged stream locations however methods to estimate baseflow require streamflow values and or chemical data to be available at the location of interest a common approach that is used to address this problem is to use empirical models that relate baseflow characteristics to basin attributes such as drainage area precipitation and soil information e g nathan and mcmahon 1992 krakauer and temimi 2011 beck et al 2013 sánchez murillo et al 2015 reddyvaraprasad et al 2020 the results of these studies however have shown mixed results some of which are summarized in this paper for example krakauer and temimi 2011 used stepwise linear regression for 61 basins across the conterminous united states to associate the baseflow recession characteristics with basin attribute predictors which resulted in a coefficient of determination r 2 of roughly 0 57 for the pacific northwest in the united states sánchez murillo et al 2015 found fair relationships among the baseflow recession characteristics and basin attributes with an r 2 of 0 57 reddyvaraprasad et al 2020 used a drainage area normalization of recession flow characteristics at geographically close locations that had observed streamflow values they found that 12 of their study basins had nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 values greater than 0 5 i e more than half the variability explained in australia nathan mcmahon 1992 used multiple linear regression to relate baseflow recession characteristics to basin attributes which resulted in r 2 values from 0 67 to 0 74 beck et al 2013 used artificial neural networks to predict baseflow recession characteristics using basin attributes which yielded an r 2 value of 0 72 our objective in this study is to present a novel approach which uses both machine learning and physical baseflow models to predict baseflow recession characteristics at ungauged stream locations the predictions from this combined approach are then compared to those from a machine learning approach random forest regression rf to relate baseflow recession characteristics to basin attributes 2 study area and data in this study data from 300 u

provided in the u s geological survey national water information system u s geological survey 2016 3 methodology 3 1 hybrid physical and machine learning approach 3 1 1 estimating the long and short time baseflow recession characteristics at gauged locations the first step in the modeling approach is to estimate long and short time baseflow recession characteristics at all basins using a physical baseflow model see flow diagram in fig 2 for several solutions to various kinds of idealized unconfined aquifers with differing geometries assumptions and boundary conditions hall 1968 brutsaert and nieber 1977 rupp and selker 2005a 2006 provide the physical basis for conceptualizing aquifer discharge into a channel as a linear or nonlinear reservoir which can be represented by the following 1 q c s n where q is the aquifer discharge s is the volume of aquifer storage and c and n are treated as constants at the scale of the individual recession events n 1 for a linear reservoir and n 1 for nonlinear reservoirs eq 1 combined with the continuity equation p et q ds dt where p is the precipitation 0 and et is the evapotranspiration 0 yields the following for linear and nonlinear models respectively 2 q q 0 e c 1 t for n 1 3 q q 0 1 c 2 t n 1 n for n 1 where c 1 and c 2 are constant for individual recession events and q0 is the aquifer discharge at time t equal to zero for n 1 it is very difficult to determine a consistent method to identify the beginning of each recession so brutsaert and nieber 1977 proposed a time derivative to solve this problem which yields the following 4 d q d t a q b where a n n 1 c 2 q 0 1 n n referred to as the baseflow recession characteristic and b 2 n 1 n are constant for individual recession events brutsaert and nieber 1977 proposed two forms of eq 4 for long time baseflow recessions one for linear and the other for nonlinear selecting the most appropriate form of eq 4 is highly dependent on the methods used to estimate the a and b values several studies e g eng and brutsaert 1999 eng and milly 2007 sánchez murillo et al 2015 tashie et al 2020 have found that the linear solution can adequately represent recession sequences using a conventional approach of using all available recession sequences known as the cloud approach however studies e g shaw and riha 2012 stoelzle et al 2012 dralle et al 2017 that have used event based approaches which analyze individual recession sequences have found that the long time response is highly nonlinear in this study the cloud and the event based approaches are not examined instead a smaller subset of recession sequences is used than what is used in the cloud based approach so the response of these groups of recession sequences are assumed to be more nonlinear than linear this long time baseflow recession assumes that the free surface of the aquifer is curvilinear i e it resembles an inverse incomplete beta function this assumption is applicable only after long times have passed typically from a few days to a month depending on the size of the basin and it is violated when the aquifer is near saturated conditions at short times brutsaert and nieber 1977 propose that the a and b for long time baseflow recessions for the nonlinear model are the following 5 a l o n g κ l o n g l a 1 5 6 b l o n g 1 5 where κlong is the long time aquifer hydraulic property 4 8038 k 0 5 f α 1 5 with dimensions of length time 1 2 k is the hydraulic conductivity length time f is the drainable porosity dimensionless α is the fraction of the basin underlain by aquifers contributing to streamflow dimensionless a is the drainage area of the basin length2 and the value of 4 8038 derives from the exact solution by boussinesq 1903 1904 to complement the long time baseflow recession behavior since it is not valid when the aquifer is near saturation brutsaert and nieber 1977 propose a short time recession behavior with the following a and b values 7 a s h o r t κ s h o r t 1 l 2 8 b s h o r t 3 where κshort is the short time aquifer hydraulic property 1 1334 k f d 3 time length4 d is the depth of the aquifer length and the value of 1 1334 derives from the exact solution by polubarinova kochina 1962 this short time recession behavior assumes that the aquifer divide is infinitely far away from the channel the κlong and κshort are typically derived using along and ashort values that are calculated using streamflow values detailed in the following paragraphs a and l the k f d or α values can be back derived if some of these variables are known for the aquifer e g brutsaert and lopez 1998 a substantial amount of literature exists on different approaches used to determine the along and ashort values using recession sequences identified from time series of streamflow values henceforth referred to as as long and as short where the s superscript denotes that these values are calculated using daily flow values monitored at streamflow gaging stations brutsaert and nieber 1977 ando et al 1986 tallaksen 1995 brutsaert and lopez 1998 eng and brutsaert 1999 rupp and selker 2005b 2006 brutsaert 2008 krakauer and termimi 2011 shaw and riha 2012 stoelzle et al 2012 sánchez murillo et al 2015 thomas et al 2015 chen and krajewski 2016 cheng et al 2016 dralle et al 2017 roques et al 2017 reddyvaraprasad et al 2020 tashie et al 2020 yang et al 2020 as a result there is no agreed upon consistent approach to determine these recession characteristic values in this study we attempt to select best recommendations from these studies where appropriate refining existing approaches to best estimate the as parameters is not the focus of this study instead this study provides a template where alternative approaches to determine as values can be interchanged with what the combined modeling approach used in this study steps 1 1 to 1 3 fig 2 in this study we do not employ the cloud envelope approach suggested by brutsaert nieber 1977 the cloud envelope approach uses all recession sequences including ones that may not have been generated by a storm event and fits envelopes to the right most and bottom of this cloud of recession sequences in this study we use a smaller subset of recession sequences to determine generalized values of as long and as short and fit a non linear function based on minimizing errors to this group of recessions in addition analyzing groups of recession sequences is chosen over single sequences to avoid the problem of determining as long and as short values based on a few points such as the recommended four point minimum by dralle et al 2017 many basins have few if any recession sequences in excess of 30 days in this study we also assume that the short and long time recession behaviors are present in the recession sequences in order to minimize the impact of contaminated baseflow values by storm events and evapotranspiration effects which violate the assumptions of the baseflow model we remove a fixed number of days from all recession sequences and use the largest magnitude recession sequences that have been found to be associated with minimal evapotranspiration step 1 1 fig 2 involves identification of all recession sequences for every streamflow gaging station based on the following the start of these sequences begins one day after the peaks occur in hydrographs plots of streamflow values versus time and ends when there are no decreases over time in streamflow values some studies use an additional criterion concerning the concavity of the recession e g yang et al 2020 to identify the end of recession sequences however the concavity criterion uses second derivatives which are sensitive to small errors in streamflow values as a result we adopt the criteria of no decreases to identify the end of recession sequences the effects from storm events can be present in the measured streamflow values several days after a peak streamflow event occurs it is important to minimize the impact of these contaminated baseflow values from all recession sequences by removing them from further analysis brutsaert nieber 1977 recommend removing the first five days after the peak streamflow value to minimize the impact of isolated precipitation events occurring on any part of the basin brutsaert 2008 further refines this recommendation by having a variable number of days removed four days after major storm events and three days for all others in other current work such as in tashie et al 2020 and yang et al 2020 two and three days were removed respectively there is little consensus in the literature on the number of days to remove from the initial recession sequences so we use the initial conservative recommendation by brutsaert nieber 1977 of removing five days to minimize the impact of storm flow effects a variety of methods exist in the literature to remove recession sequences from analysis based on the magnitude of the peak streamflow associated with these sequences e g biswal and marani 2010 ye et al 2014 these approaches seek to remove recession sequences that do not substantially generate a groundwater response dralle et al 2017 recommend using a less restrictive variable threshold approach to removing recession sequences in this study a group of the largest 20 of recession sequences based on the starting q value that includes at least 10 days is used to estimate the as long and as short values for each basin these recession sequences are chosen because they are likely to generate a groundwater response and these sequences are less impacted by evapotranspiration effects shaw and riha 2012 step 1 2 fig 2 step 1 3 fig 2 applies an automated approach to provide a non subjective fit of the two lines with slope equal to 1 5 and 3 to the group of recession sequences on the log10 dq dt s and log10 q s plots where the subscript s denotes that these values are calculated from streamflow values this approach is similar to a fixed slope piecewise linear regression however these two lines are joined at a hinge point with the line with slope equal to 1 5 on the left and the one with slope equal to 3 on the right x point on fig 2 step 1 3 the following process is used to obtain the optimal placement of these lines 1 a 1000 by 1000 grid spanning the range of log10 dq dt s and log10 q s values is placed onto the plot 2 the hinge point of the two lines is placed on an intersecting point on the grid starting at the lowest log10 dq dt s and log10 q s values 3 a root mean square error rmse is calculated from the errors between the lines and the log10 dq dt s values for each log10 q s value using 9 r m s e j 1 j lo g 10 d q d t s j lo g 10 d q d t b 3 j 2 i 1 i lo g 10 d q d t s i lo g 10 d q d t b 1 5 i 2 j i where i is the total number of observations to the left of the hinge point j is the total number of observations to the right of the hinge point log10 dq dt b 3 are the log10 dq dt s values calculated from a line with slope equal to 3 placed through the hinge point and log10 dq dt b 1 5 are the log10 dq dt s values calculated from a line with slope equal to 1 5 placed through the hinge point 4 steps 2 and 3 are repeated for every intersecting point on the grid and 5 the optimal placement of the lines is associated with the smallest rmse value from this optimal placement the as long and as short values are determined for each basin to evaluate whether the group of recession sequences are well represented by the short and long time baseflow recession characteristics an r 2 value is calculated based on the optimal placement of the lines with slope equal to 3 and 1 5 for each basin 3 1 2 determining regions with similar baseflow recession characteristics step 2 fig 2 involves the determination of regions of similar baseflow recession characteristics proximal basins most likely will share similar aquifer hydraulic properties brutsaert and nieber 1977 brutsaert and lopez 1998 eng and brutsaert 1999 brutsaert and nieber 1977 demonstrate that the hydraulic properties κs long and κs short eqs 5 and 7 where the superscript s denotes these values are associated with the group of recession sequences for a single basin are roughly constant among geographically close basins so as long and as short are functions only of the geometric properties of the aquifer l a 1 5 and 1 l 2 an approach in the literature does not exist however for determining the geographic extent of these areas to identify the regions of similar baseflow recession characteristics and their geographic extent in the western and eastern united states we use a k means clustering approach within each region based on z scores of location latitude and longitude and hydraulic property κs long step 2 1 fig 2 for each basin the κs long values are determined from rearranging eq 5 to solve for κs long i e κs long l a 1 5 as long the initial clusters of basins identified by the k means approach for the western and eastern united states are visually inspected aggregated disaggregated and adjusted as necessary based on the three z scores in step 2 2 fig 2 two regional relationships are formed among all basins for each cluster a power law relationship between the ar long and l a 1 5 values and another one between the ar short and 1 l 2 values i e ar long κr long l a 1 5 ν and ar short κr short 1 l 2 ω where the r superscript denotes a regional value across all basins in each cluster and ν and ω are regional constants the ν and ω values are checked to ascertain if their values are close to one and r 2 values are computed for each cluster 3 1 3 classifying and predicting baseflow recession characteristics at ungauged stream locations application of water balance models lumped hydrologic models and empirical low flow models to ungauged stream locations requires basin scale characterization of the baseflow recession characteristics so it is important to have a method that can predict these characteristics without observed chemical and or streamflow information step 3 fig 2 involves the development of a method to assign an ungauged stream location to one of the clusters of similar baseflow recession characteristics in this study we use random forest classification a commonly used machine learning approach step 3 1 fig 2 the r programming package randomforest liaw and wiener 2018 is used in this study random forest is chosen in this study because it has been shown to have superior predictive capabilities over other statistical methods such as multivariate adaptive regression splines regression trees bagging trees logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis prasad et al 2006 cutler et al 2007 and it has been used in previous baseflow studies e g singh et al 2019 briefly rf is an ensemble classification and regression tree method breiman 2001 random forest models typically are formed from hundreds to thousands of individual trees for each tree a random subset of predictor variables and associated predictands is selected to form the model furthermore at each split in the tree a random set of predictors is chosen out of all candidate predictors to reduce the correlation among trees in the forest a final prediction in rf is achieved by inputting the predictors to each tree in this study a similar approach by eng et al 2017 is used to develop two multi class classification rf models one for the western united states and one for the eastern united states all basins are classified into their corresponding cluster name identified previously in step 2 fig 2 and used as the predictand one hundred randomly generated bootstrapped calibration 90 and validation 10 data sets are generated for both regions eastern and western united states for each calibration data set an initial multi class classification rf model is formed using all 181 basin attributes to identify the 20 most significant basin attributes based on the gini index cutler et al 2007 using this reduced set of basin attributes the parameters of the multi class classification rf model are mtry which is the number of randomly selected predictors to use at each split in the trees and ntrees which is the number of trees to optimize the fit of the multi class classification rf model a gridded parameter search is implemented mtry values range from 5 to 20 in increments of 5 and similarly ntrees values range from 100 to 2000 in increments of 100 the optimal values of mtry and ntrees parameters were chosen based on maximizing the weighted macro f1 statistic grandini et al 2020 the final multi class classification rf is formed using the optimal mtry and ntrees values the validation data set is used in this final model to make class predictions a weighted macro f1 statistic is calculated based on all the predictions from the 100 validation data sets the weighted macro f1 statistic ranges in value from 0 to 1 1 for a perfect model and this metric measures the overall accuracy of classification models from the multi class classification rf models predictions of cluster membership from the 100 validation data sets are made for all locations step 3 2 fig 2 the ar long κr long l a 1 5 ν and ar short κr short 1 l 2 ω relationships of the appropriate cluster are then applied using the l and a values of a basin to obtain an estimate of the as long and as short values ae long and ae short respectively where the e superscript denotes an estimated value step 4 1 fig 2 these values are then plotted against the as long and as short values the median and inner quartile range iqr of the absolute values of the normalized residuals in percent are reported for overall performance step 4 2 fig 2 the absolute normalized residuals are calculated as 10 ε a l

stream locations using the 180 basin attributes where the a and l values are replaced with either l a 1 5 or 1 l 2 for the as long and as short models respectively four regional models are formed in this study two as long and as short for the western united states and two for the eastern united states the tuning parameters are the same as the multi class classification rf and the same method is used to determine their optimal values except that the root mean square error is used to determine the optimal parameters model performance is measured by percent variance explained the median and iqr of ε 4 results the median and iqr of r 2 values for assessing whether the recession sequences are well represented by the short and long time baseflow recession characteristics were 0 89 iqr 0 12 and

two examples are provided in fig 4 demonstrating a good and a poor fit using methods in step 1 3 on fig 2 for the as long values the hybrid approach resulted in the lowest normalized residual values

a 1 5 similarly the ω values for all regions were close to a value of one figs 6 and 7 differing at most by 16 which indicates that the κr short values are constant in each of these regions and are a function mainly of the geometric property of aquifers 1 l 2 the rf classification models in the hybrid method resulted in weighted macro f1 statistics of 0 88 and 0 70 for the western and eastern united states respectively based on the confusion matrices shown in tables 1 and 2 the most significant predictor variables in the western united states were latitude monthly minimum number of days of measurable precipitation june july and august number of days of measurable precipitation the most significant predictor variables in the eastern united states were latitude average silt and sand

states and 1300 and 20 for the eastern united states 5 discussion this study demonstrates that predictions of the baseflow recession characteristic in ungauged stream locations can be improved using the proposed hybrid framework over machine learning methods like random forest however the improvement in predictions of baseflow recession characteristics are based on one set of criteria e g nonlinear model minimum recession lengths analyzing groups of recessions instead of individual recession sequences using a different set of criteria to determine the baseflow recession characteristics at gauged basins fig 2 steps 1 1 to 1 3 could potentially alter the regions and the accuracy of the predictions in the framework as mentioned previously the literature proposes many different criteria with no consensus sensitivity of the framework to different sets of criteria similar to methods used in dralle et al 2017 on calculating the baseflow recession characteristics could be tested however this analysis is outside the scope of this study the work by jachens et al 2020 found that the within basin variations in the short and long time baseflow recession characteristics are significantly related to interstorm arrival period and other storm related features if the interstorm arrival period is a significant driver of the within basin variability in the short and long time baseflow recession characteristics it will be an important driver of inter basin variability in both baseflow recession characteristics in this study the inter basin variability of the short and long time baseflow recession characteristics are not substantially associated with interstorm arrival periods average number of storms and average length of storms since these variables were not present in the top 20 basin attributes in any of the random forest models their absence indicates that they explain little to none of the inter basin variability of the baseflow recession characteristics these findings are not consistent with the findings by jachens et al 2020 for within basin variability of baseflow recession characteristics in this study the mean baseflow recession behavior is examined over at least 10 years of record at all basins so the interstorm arrival periods average number of storms and average length of storms may become more important over shorter time periods such as seasonal to monthly time frames another plausible explanation is that the storm features could appear to be uncorrelated due to the spatial structure of the storm features relative to the inter basin distances other issues related to the analysis are the unbalanced nature of the recession data and the assumption that the recession sequences transition from short to long time baseflow recessions the conventional cloud approach by brutsaert and nieber 1977 mixes numerous recession sequences that do not transition to the long time baseflow recession i e recession sequences generated by small magnitude storm events these types of recession sequences form a large proportion of the points analyzed in cloud approaches which could substantially influence the determination of the short and long time baseflow recession using regression models fit to the entire cloud of data e g vogel and kroll 1992 tashie et al 2020 the use of groups of recession sequences instead of the cloud approach mitigates some of this biasing this bias can be further reduced by using methods of oversampling or undersampling pan et al 2020 however the assumption that recession sequences single event groups and cloud transition from short to long time behaviors is not easily addressed and this assumption is used in many studies e g brutseart and lopez 1998 rupp and selker 2005 2006 this assumption is heavily dependent on the size of the basin since headwater basins can take less than a day to a few days to drain as opposed to larger basins that take several days thus the availability of high frequency subdaily streamflow observations in headwater basins are necessary to test this assumption if short time recession behaviors are present the subdaily streamflow observations at the locations examined in this study are not available so this assumption could not be tested the proposed physical and machine learning approach performs consistently better than the purely machine learning approach tested in this study for predicting long and short time baseflow recession characteristics at ungauged stream locations the performance of rf regressions percent variance explained values of 66 and 69 are comparable to other studies nathan and mcmahon 1992 krakauer and temimi 2011 beck et al 2013 sánchez murillo et al 2015 reddyvaraprasad et al 2020 for predicting long time baseflow recession characteristics using other statistical models such as linear regression and artificial neural networks the performance of rf regressions in predicting short time baseflow recession characteristics however is very poor in both regions tested in this study with substantial over predictions of the true values these previous studies do not report models predicting short time baseflow recession characteristics the difference in predictive performance between as long and as short could be due to the differing amount of streamflow data used to derive these values the amount of streamflow data can vary substantially across basins as can be seen in fig 4 and as a result as short values are more highly variable than as long values the framework presented in this paper provides a viable approach to estimate both as long and as short values at ungauged stream locations and these values can be utilized in lumped hydrologic models and empirical low flow prediction models methods in the literature that use as long and as short values as predictors in empirical approaches substantially improve the predictions of low flow and baseflow characteristics at ungauged stream locations this improvement occurs because these baseflow recession characteristics explain a substantial amount of variability in low flow characteristics however guidance on how as long and as short values are obtained at ungauged stream locations is lacking e g vogel and kroll 1992 the method by eng and milly 2007 requires at a minimum a pair of streamflow measurements on the same streamflow recession to realize improvement in the prediction of 7 day 10 year low streamflows q7 10 the proposed approach in this study presents a method that does not require any streamflow information i e partial miscellaneous or daily streamflow measurements at the ungauged stream location and it only requires aquifer geometric properties i e a and l and the assigned region of similar baseflow recession characteristics brutsaert and nieber 1977 brutsaert and lopez 1998 and eng and brutsaert 1999 demonstrated that geographically close basins share similar aquifer hydraulic properties however these studies were conducted in small regions geographic areas smaller than a medium sized state in the united states such as kansas so they could not address how many of these coherent regions exist and the extent of these regions of similar aquifer hydraulic properties in this study the geographic extent of regions of similar aquifer hydraulic properties spans multiple states in both the western and eastern united states and there are at least four major regions in the western united states and three regions in the eastern united states the difference or variability among regions of similar baseflow recession characteristics in both the western and eastern united states is mainly driven by latitude a climate proxy and not the interstorm metrics this finding indicates that the inter basin variability of baseflow recession characteristics is explained by the synoptic scale circulation patterns that operate on longer time scales than the interstorm effects however if this study analyzed seasonal time series of baseflow recession characteristics instead of the historical means the interstorm metrics could become more important in explaining some of the inter basin variability of these characteristics this driver is consistent with the finding that the majority of the spatial variability of streamflow can be explained by large scale circulation patterns precipitation and evapotranspiration as described in several studies e g redmond and koch 1991 kahya and dracup 1993 wolock and mccabe 1999 bonsal and shabbar 2008 the vast majority of streamflow observations are often made during periods of no precipitation so these observations represent baseflows in the western united states precipitation events are typically not in phase with maximum evapotranspiration periods since precipitation events are largely concentrated during winter e g finkelstein and truppi 1991 and maximum evapotranspiration periods occur generally during summer e g zhang et al 2020 measurable precipitation during summer is another key predictor in the rf classification models for the regions in the western united states which possibly indicates that the timing of precipitation and evapotranspiration relative to one another is an important driver for spatial variability of baseflow recessions dissimilar to the western united states the precipitation events in the eastern united states are in phase with maximum evapotranspiration periods finkelstein and truppi 1991 zhang et al 2020 and the predictors from rf classification models reflect this characteristic in a lack of predictors quantifying the level of overlap of precipitation and evapotranspiration periods these findings are also consistent with the findings for streamflow by wolock and mccabe 1999 the regions defined in this study are for baseflow recession behavior based on the entire historical records for all locations these regions will change if the analysis is performed on a seasonal or monthly basis the incorporation of the evapotranspiration effects on the outflow from aquifers is not addressed in this study the as short values are particularly susceptible to evapotranspiration effects shaw and riha 2012 compared to as long values as can be seen in a few of the noisier regional relationships to the aquifer geometric properties periods of the largest evapotranspiration effects are from june to july in the united states zhang et al 2020 roughly 80 and 83 of the recession sequences analyzed in this study for the western and eastern united states do not occur in june and july so the majority of recession sequences are not concurrent with maximum evapotranspiration however 20 and 17 of the recession sequences in the western and eastern united states respectively occur during periods of large evapotranspiration effects as a result noise may be introduced in calculating as short values in addition the sensitivity of as short values to record length and how these record lengths span wet and dry periods of the climate e g mauget 2003 mccabe and wolock 2014 could influence calculation of as short values an alternative to restricting the types of recession sequences to analyze could be to incorporate evapotranspiration effects into eqs 2 and 3 however this modification is outside the scope of this paper in addition to evapotranspiration effects estimates of aquifer outflow behavior can be confounded by snowmelt in snow dominated basins miller et al 2015 this effect is particularly acute in mountainous areas in the western united states the length of the snowmelt season typically lasts for 40 days in the western united states trujillo and molotch 2014 the start of the snowmelt season typically begins in april and ends in the middle of may trujillo and molotch 2014 in the eastern united states snowmelt effects typically end by may hodgkins and dudley 2006 the percentages of recessions used in this study that occur within the april to may period were 9 and 13 for the western and eastern united states respectively these recessions that occur from april to may are likely contributing to the noisier relationships in this study an alternative method to reduce the impact of snowmelt contaminated baseflows is to exclude them from analysis by limiting selection of recession sequences to periods outside the snowmelt period 6 summary this paper proposes a framework using a physical baseflow model combined with machine learning models to predict short and long time baseflow recession characteristics in ungauged stream locations that are more accurate and precise than using only machine learning methods for the western and eastern united states seven regions where the baseflow recession characteristics are mostly constant four in the western and three in the eastern united states are identified from the application of this framework interstorm effects i e arrival period number of storms and length of storms explain little to none of the inter basin variability of long term baseflow recession characteristics and this variability is better explained by the synoptic scale circulation patterns that operate on longer time scales than the interstorm effects the methodological choices used in this study to derive the baseflow recession characteristics that are used in subsequent steps of the proposed framework represent one way to estimates these values the other numerous methodological choices for determining baseflow recession characteristics from streamflow values needs further exploration on how these characteristics impact

36,performance assessment of co 2 storage sites requires realistic modelling of the impact of heterogeneous aquifer properties on brine co 2 flow heterogeneity gives rise to non uniform saturation distributions that are affected by the balance of capillary gravitational and viscous forces since equivalent relative permeability and capillary pressure depend on saturation their shape also varies with flow rate and gravitational phase segregation this must be considered during performance assessment here we present a new workflow for the computation of equivalent relative permeability from force balance controlled saturation distributions in heterogeneous rocks computed with a novel continuum scale flow solver with special provisions for material interfaces instead of simulating core flooding the solver is used to recirculate phases across periodic boundaries until their distribution is in equilibrium with the applied forces our workflow is demonstrated on a segmented x ray scan of a core sample of a laminated sandstone from a potential co 2 storage site in the surat basin australia and an outcrop analogue model from argentina this application highlights how heterogeneity manifests in multi phase flow functions confirming rate dependence after eliminating capillary end effects keywords two phase flow steady state upscaling relative permeability capillary heterogeneity heterogeneous porous media data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction pore scale heterogeneity and bedforms in sandstone can now be recorded accurately by x ray scanning and subsequent segmentation e g turner et al 2004 knackstedt et al 2006 the multi phase fluid flow properties of constituent rocktypes can be analysed by pore network modelling fatt 1956 knackstedt et al 2001 xiong et al 2016 yet the ensemble multiphase flow properties of such composite rock types that manifest nonuniform saturation distributions remain relatively poorly understood advanced imaging of multiphase flow through heterogeneous rocks e g kulkarni et al 1998 turner et al 2004 tang and kovscek 2011 krevor et al 2011 leu et al 2014 herring et al 2016 aljasmi and sahimi 2020 has revealed the limitations of classic saturation functions it now appears that the long held assumption that capillary forces control the spatial saturation distribution only holds at the mm scale it follows that establishing a rigorous modelling and numeric simulation workflow which simultaneously considers information from the lower limit of imaging resolution to the representative elementary volume rev scale of heterogeneous porous media has become a major research objective e g huang et al 1995 durlofsky 1997 virnovsky et al 2004 rustad et al 2008 kuo and benson 2021 berg and ott 2012 rabinovich et al 2015 jackson et al 2018 ruspini et al 2021 the aim is to predict ensemble flow behaviour without constructing andcomputing costly fine scale representations of heterogeneous porous media the aforementioned publications describe different methods for this purpose there are many approaches highlighting the importance of saturation functions 1 ones that predict spatial saturation distributions relying on the capillary pressure equilibrium or viscous limit assumption e g ekrann and aasen 2000 or iteratively for some externally applied pressure gradient virnovsky et al 2004 lohne et al 2004 2 semi analytical approaches darman et al 2002 rabinovich and cheng 2020 cheng and rabinovich 2020 moreno and rabinovich 2021 and 3 forward flow simulation based ones kyte and berry 1975 zhang et al 2008 sheng et al 2011 boon et al 2022a that predict spatial saturation distributions by forward simulation as remarked by durlofsky 1997 with reference to the pseudo relative permeability of heterogeneous composites of porous rocks the traditional functional form of saturation functions is too limited to capture observed behaviour and instead an extended description is needed taking into account the spatial variance of saturation and velocity saturation covariance durlofsky 1997 and as seen in physical experiments caudle et al 1951 henderson et al 1998 skauge and poulsen 2000 perrin et al 2009 krause 2012 krause and benson 2015 jackson et al 2018 kuo and benson 2021 rabinovich et al 2015 relative permeability is rate dependent this has also been illustrated numerically darman et al 2002 virnovsky et al 2004 lohne et al 2006 the recent field data based simulation research of shao et al 2021 and shao et al 2022 also indicates flow rate dependence they argue that this property is required to capture the flow behaviour of laminated sandstone composites accurately mishra et al 2020 and use sector scale simulations to demonstrate that consideration of this behaviour maps to differences in plume shape and saturation distributions in the storage site shao et al 2021 rate dependence has been explained by different mechanisms low rate curves differ from high rate curves because capillary trapping occurs in the samples e g rabinovich et al 2015 commonly these differences are modelled distinguishing viscous limit vl flow from capillary limit cl end member cases in the vl idealisation capillary and gravitational forces are ignored so that total mobility is influenced by saturation only due to the viscosity contrast between the phases since fractional flow is constant along streamlines for this assumption saturation distributions can be constructed tracing these starting at the inlet where fractional flow is prescribed again relative permeability is calculated from the ensuing saturation distributions ekrann and aasen 2000 pickup and hern 2002 kløv et al 2003 virnovsky et al 2004 rustad et al 2008 vl and cl approximations permit to determine bounding curves for rate dependent relative permeability it is unrealistic however to prescribe uniform constant fractional inflows to heterogeneous porous media in which saturation and flow velocity vary spatially matthai and burney 2019 this variability also implies that force balances will vary and cl regions may co exist with vl ones although reasonably accurate approximations have been presented in the literature e g virnovsky et al 2004 lohne et al 2006 rabinovich et al 2015 the cooperative behaviour that controls the shape of ensemble relative permeability and capillary pressure curves in this scenario still warrants further investigation since flow based upscaling involves numeric simulation its results also depend on the physical realism of the simulator i e how it approximates viscous gravitational and capillary driven flows gravitational phase segregation and filtration at material interfaces as well as capillary barrier formation input models also need to be sufficiently refined to represent both their geometric features and those of the saturation distribution within them standard simulators rely on regular grids saturation is treated as piecewise constant and fluxes are derived by first order two point flux approximation tpfa based on transmissibility multipliers generated by harmonic averaging of the properties of adjacent cells chen et al 1993 document that this framework produces first order grid orientation artefacts i e preferential flow along the grid axes youssef et al 2021 quantify the high level of refinement needed by this approach for obtaining grid convergence of saturation in the presence of gravitational forces they also describe breaches of capillary barriers that occurred although their entry pressure had not been exceeded in summary these observations indicate that there is scope for improvement of the numeric methods that predict non uniform saturation patterns in composite rocks with bed form heterogeneity here we present an alternative flow based method for extracting ensemble relative permeability curves from numeric simulations applied to models of heterogeneous sandstone composites which consist of different petrotypes with unique single and multiphase flow properties e g mishra et al 2020 the composites are characterised by x ray scanning and segmentation øren et al 2019 and the flow properties of their constituent rock types are determined by pore network modelling bakke and øren 1997 øren et al 2019 relative permeability on the continuum scale is computed from saturation distributions derived from forward simulations with a new geometrically more flexible numeric simulator with special provisions for material interfaces tran et al 2020 honouring the viscous capillary interface conditions van duijn and de neef 1998 can the aforementioned issues with the constant fractional flow boundary conditions be overcome by changing the setup of the computer simulations unlike for inlet fractional flow based methods simulations are started with a uniform or capillary limit saturation distribution re distributing phases while honouring periodic boundary conditions for the saturation equation periodicity ascertains that total saturation stays constant during phase redistribution simulations continue until a steady state is obtained and the saturation distribution is in equilibrium with the applied force balances ensemble relative permeability is calculated by volume averaging of phase velocity and phase pressure gradients forward simulation and analysis steps are repeated across the saturation range of interest at saturation increments sufficiently small to get well defined relative permeability curves for some prescribed saturation values there will be no flow when this occurs the threshold far field pressure gradient which needs to be exceeded to generate flow across the composite i e to create satiated conditions is recorded this novel workflow and relative permeability analysis method is demonstrated on a model of a segmented scan of sandstone core from the precipice formation surat basin australia and an outcrop analogue model of a layered sandstone from chile to further enhance confidence in and to better illustrate the advantages of the new flow solver that we have developed to compute the saturation distributions a direct comparison with results obtained for a hele shaw cell model of cross bedded sandstone and with a standard reservoir simulator are presented at the beginning of the results section al wahaibi et al 2005 this paper is structured as follows a methodology section describes the new upscaling workflow including model setup application of initial and periodic boundary conditions and steps needed to calculate equivalent relative permeability and capillary pressure curves next a core plug and an outcrop analogue demonstration model are presented followed by an analysis of their single and multi phase flow properties saturation patterns and ensemble relative permeability as determined by application of our new workflow 2 methodology our new method forms part of a new largely automated upscaling workflow which was developed in a joint project with researchers at the australian national university csiro perth and petricore norway knackstedt 2020 while anu and their norwegian partners focused on the scanning and segmentation of the core samples and the calculation of saturation functions for constituent petrotypes using pore network modelling respectively bakke and øren 1997 ramstad et al 2012 our work employed their results to parameterise continuum scale models with embedded discontinuities aimed at gaining an understanding of the dynamics of multiphase flow in the whole core and its equivalent properties fig 1 network model derived saturation functions of constituent petrotypes provide the input for our whole core models and flow solver while the input saturation functions were generated relying on the cl assumption that capillary forces control the saturation distribution the whole core functions were derived from saturation distributions arrived at by numeric flow simulation employing the upscaling approach described in the following this approach permits the variation of the balances between viscous externally applied pressure gradients gravitational buoyancy and capillary forces entry pressure constraints and capillary pressure saturation derivatives determined from the capillary pressure curves of the constituent petrotypes due to the heterogeneity of the core the magnitude of the ensuing flow regime aware functions also depends on flow direction and phase velocity boon and benson 2021 these extra features permit the australian carbon geo sequestration simulator acgss shao et al 2021 to reproduce the behaviour of interest at the field scale complementary to the cl and vl saturation functions developed by other members of the team ruspini et al 2021 we will show that the flow simulation based functions are applicable to displacement that occurs in flow regimes between these limits and including conditions where the displacing phase is more mobile than the displaced phase e g lake 1989 this is relevant because supercritical co 2 is more mobile than formation brine so that coarsening instabilities can control the shape of the plume berg and ott 2012 nicolaides et al 2015 in summary the flow based upscaling from the petrotype to the whole core and borehole periphery scale is enabled by the new workflow and approach described and demonstrated herein building on the overall pore to core well spot scale imaging segmentation and analysis workflow developed by knackstedt 2020 see fig 1 2 1 flow solver the multi phase flow solver for the simulation of the potentially non uniform saturation distributions is implemented using a hybrid finite element finite volume fefv collocated finite element finite volume mesh framework fig 2a operator splitting is performed to solve the elliptic pressure equation with the finite element method and the hyperbolic transport equations with the finite volume method cordes and kinzelbach 1992 geiger et al 2004 paluszny et al 2007 among other benefits this unstructured spatially adaptive discretisation facilitates the accurate representation of bedforms and irregularly shaped laminations vughs and other geologic features within a complex geometry in three dimensions while existing bedform modelling techniques facilitate the construction of corner point grids that even conform to pinchouts of layers nordahl and ringrose 2008 the main purpose of such regularised representations is cl and vl upscaling and volumetrics as a consequence these grids lack the local refinement needed to resolve both flow geometry and the saturation patterns that will emerge in the simulation to accurately model phase selective fluid transfer i e filtration by material interfaces the basic fefv method is extended into a discontinuous finite element finite volume method dfefvm fig 2b nick and matthäi 2011a b tran et al 2020 embedding material interfaces as boundaries endowed with additional degrees of freedom for pressure and saturation the interface coupling scheme of tran et al 2020 implements the interface transfer conditions van duijn and de neef 1998 accurately resolving nonlinear viscous capillary interface transfer spontaneous imbibition and filtration that may lead to jump discontinuities in pressure and saturation a change of variables from saturation to capillary pressure and vice versa is performed where and when the spatial gradient of either variable becomes small accelerating convergence this implementation facilitates the accurate modelling of relaxation oscillations that can occur when the non wetting phase accumulates upstream of an increased entry pressure layer eventually choking off any flow across this boundary benzing et al 1996 in this situation a continuous upstream fluid supply will promote pressure buildup until the petrotype s entry pressure is exceeded and the capillary blockage breaks down releasing the non wetting phase downstream this release is associated with a pressure drop for a constant rate upstream fluid supply this process will repeat itself 2 2 upscaling homogenisation procedure the proposed steady state upscaling procedure for determining the equivalent relative permeability of heterogeneous composites of different rock types involves three steps 1 compute steady state single phase fluid pressure distributions and post process flow velocities to constrain the equivalent permeability tensor k 2 perform two phase fluid flow and transport simulations computing the fluid saturation distributions from which equivalent phase permeabilities k α are calculated repeat this for different average saturation values spanning the range of interest 3 evaluate the equivalent relative permeability curves k r α s w v t using the equivalent permeability from 1 each of the saturation distributions computed in step 2 represents the steady state that persists given the applied magnitudes of viscous gravitational and capillary forces 2 2 1 evaluating the effective permeability tensor the effective permeability tensor computation step 1 follows the non local permeability upscaling approach of durlofsky 1991 for simplicity it is illustrated here for two dimensional models 1 apply the pressure differential δ p x on the opposing left and right boundaries of the rectangular model and no flow boundary conditions or a linear pressure interpolation to the remaining boundaries fig 3 subscripts x y indicate the direction of the resulting pressure gradient 2 compute the pressure field in the model with a linear finite element method lfem and post process it to determine the local pressure gradients p x i p x i x p x i y in each finite element i 3 compute the flow velocity u x i u x i x u x i y in each finite element i from darcy s law 4 compute the volume weighted average velocity u x u x x u x y and pressure gradient p x p x x p x y in the model as 1 u x x u x y 1 i 1 n v i i 1 n u x i x v i i 1 n u x i y v i 2 p x x p x y 1 i 1 n v i i 1 n p x i x v i i 1 n p x i y v i where v i is the volume of finite element i and n is the number of elements in the domain 5 rotate the boundary conditions apply the pressure differential δ p y between the top and bottom sides of the model and no flow conditions to the remaining sides 6 compute the pressure field and post process it to obtain the volume weighted average velocities u y u y x u y y and pressure gradients p y p y x p y y as already described in steps 2 3 and 4 7 the equivalent permeability tensor is computed by solving the linear system of equations 3 p x x p x y 0 0 0 0 p x x p x y p y x p y y 0 0 0 0 p y x p y y 0 1 1 0 k x x k x y k y x k y y μ u x x u x y u y x u y y 0 where μ is the fluid viscosity which is assigned a constant value it is worth noting that the symmetry of the equivalent permeability tensor extra equation in algebraic system can be imposed as an additional constraint k x y k y x we do not impose this symmetry constraint but check our solution that it satisfies it 2 2 2 evaluating the equivalent relative permeability while capillary limit upscaling leads to a unique saturation distribution for any chosen value of capillary pressure e g ekrann and aasen 2000 relaxing this assumption admits different distributions depending on the balances between the capillary viscous and gravitational forces to obtain such distributions forward multiphase simulation is required in the presence of material interfaces the drainage process will produce different saturation distributions dependent on whether capillary barriers arise during phase redistribution or are breached by it e g tran et al 2020 this implies that saturation distributions can also be path dependent continuous capillary barriers formed during a flow simulation will block the flow so that the equivalent permeability is zero for the corresponding average saturation and magnitude of forces the pressure differential across the model below which this blockage occurs is recorded as the threshold capillary pressure of the rock composite e g shosa and cathles 2001 to ascertain reproducibility of the saturation distributions the new flow simulation procedure that we have developed relies on periodic boundary conditions for the saturation equation forward simulation starts with a plausible initial saturation distribution such as a potentially uniform saturation for conditions near the viscous limit or the capillary limit distribution for conditions near the cl clearly this initialisation must not violate the end point saturations of the constituent petrotypes of the model the relative proportions of the different petrotypes therefore determine the saturation endpoints of the ensemble for the applied force balances the fluid phases are recirculated through the periodic boundaries of the model fig 4 and the saturation distribution evolves from its initial state to the new equilibrium state the computational effort required and the physical time that elapses during this process depends on model size and the distance from the final state since this process is asymptotic a termination criterion needs to be defined like in predictor corrector methods we use the maximum saturation change that occurs in any cell of the model over time in summary we propose a steady state relative permeability upscaling procedure that entails the following steps 1 assign compute the initial saturation distribution s w to the finite volume cells across the domain honouring the capillary limit saturation endpoints of the constituent rock types note that these cells are centred on the nodes of the collocated finite element mesh on the nodes of which fluid pressure is computed 2 assign periodic boundary conditions for saturation to the finite volumes on opposing sides of the model and no flow boundary conditions to any remaining ones this requires that the nodes and finite volumes on the opposing boundaries are matched and that the model geometry is matched as well otherwise saturation artefacts will arise at the ensuing discontinuities 3 apply an initial guess of the pressure differential between the nodes matching across the periodic boundaries to create the desired level of viscous forces due to the nonlinearity of total mobility finding the pressure drop that generates the bulk flow rate of interest may require iteration 4 define an exit criterion for the simulation here a maximum 1 change of saturation in any petrotype of the model between two consecutive pressure solves is taken 5 the phase permeability of phase α that is a piece wise constant property of the finite element e as a function of water saturation then becomes 4 k α e s w e k r α s w e k e where s w e is the water saturation interpolated to the finite elements integration points because material properties are discretised as piecewise constant on the finite elements 6 use the same procedure to that described in section 2 2 1 to evaluate the equivalent phase permeability tensor k α s w or the scalar equivalent phase permeability in the case of a one dimensional setup 7 the equivalent phase relative permeability tensor in the model is then determined by 5 k r α s w k α s w k 1 where k is the effective intrinsic permeability tensor of the model computed as explained in section 2 2 1 note that the eigenvalues of the relative permeability tensor correspond to the equivalent ensemble relative permeability in the corresponding coordinate direction of the model in the case where the tensor is diagonal i e aligned with the coordinate axes 8 repeat this sequence of steps for different initial saturations s w choosing sufficiently small increments to span the saturation range constrained by the endpoint saturations of the constituent rock types how small the saturation increments need to be is a trade off between the desired relative permeability curves smoothness and the computational effort that is invested apart from relative permeability equivalent capillary pressure curves are needed so that the upscaled properties can be used for sector scale and field scale simulation in the capillary limit there exists a unique relationship between capillary pressure and saturation the aforementioned threshold pressure of the composite can be used as its capillary entry pressure noting that in anisotropic samples especially those with through going laminations its value will vary with the direction of the pressure gradient shao et al 2022 show that this dependence can be implemented in a reservoir simulator by interpolating entry pressure values between the layer parallel and layer perpendicular end member cases considering the local direction of flow in the presence of viscous and gravitational forces capillary pressure is no longer uniform even at fully satiated conditions in this case we simply compute the finite volume weighted average of capillary pressure in the model from the equilibrium saturation distribution finally it is worth noting that these relative permeability and capillary pressure computations are readily automated and near the capillary limit the extra computational effort required as compared to steady state upscaling is small although models sufficiently refined for flow simulation are required 3 demonstration models prior to its application to the relative permeability upscaling of heterogeneous rock composites the realism of the saturation distributions obtained with the new flow solver was tested by a comparison with physical experiments carried out on a hele shaw cell model of cross bedded sand al wahaibi et al 2005 see fig 11 in this 13 25 cm model coarse fine foresets and a bottom set were created by depositing graded glass beads the capillary entry pressure of the resulting bead packs varies between 770 and 2400 pascals and their permeability from 10 to 250 darcies in the experiment non wetting phase gas dyed blue was injected at a constant rate through the left boundary displacing an oleic proxy reservoir fluid the bottom and top boundaries were kept closed and the right boundary was maintained at a constant fluid static pressure the calculation of equivalent relative permeability curves is illustrated with two models although we have successfully applied the procedure to three dimensional models fig 1 for simplicity the models discussed here are in 2d the first one is based on a 14 cm tall 5 cm wide segmented x ray scan of a sample from a well drilled into the precipice sandstone in the surat basin qld australia knackstedt 2020 ruspini et al 2021 the second two dimensional model was built from an outcrop of intertidal sandstones in argentina sleveland et al 2020 3 1 laminated sandstone model cm scale fig 5 shows the laminated quartz sandstone model core2d it consists of four different petrotypes forming 10 subhorizontal laminations the input data for this upscaling simulation porosity permeability brooks corey parameter were extracted from the x ray tomographic image while the capillary and relative permeabilty curves were computed by network modelling this explains the unusually high precision given in table 1 it has to be stressed that these values do not translate into accuracy because of the natural variability of the sandstone the reader is referred to øren et al 2019 for the detailed analysis procedure and justification of the precision of the given values the brooks corey model was used to model the relative permeability and capillary pressure of the petrotypes in this sample the mean pore size and its distribution determined from the x ray images were used to calculate porosity and permeability øren et al 2019 see table 1 and table 2 the permeability of the sandstone is very high spanning a narrow range between 2 and 11 darcys porosity ranges between 24 and 28 the quartz clasts are angular yet the sandstone is relatively well sorted this is reflected in the brooks corey parameter λ values layers 3 and 5 have the highest and lowest values of this pore size distribution related parameter the capillary entry pressure varies between 0 3 kpa and 1 2 kpa among the petrotypes layers 0 5 and 7 have the highest values 1 kpa equivalent to co 2 column heights greater than 23 cm for the given density contrast between the co 2 and brine to perform the upscaling simulations a triangular mesh was built conforming to the material interfaces in the laminated core sample fig 6 model core2d was discretised using 4296 triangular elements split boundaries were inserted between all laminations to accurately model these material interfaces two sets of simulations were run to assess the effect of flow rate on the equivalent relative permeability in the first set a small pressure difference of 1 5 kpa was applied between the bottom and top of the model to model a near capillary limit scenario while ascertaining flow in the second set a pressure difference of 10 kpa was used to model significant viscous forces n c a p 1 1 0 4 two sets of simulations were conducted one with and another without gravitational forces to see whether these had any influence on the saturation distribution 3 2 intertidal sandstone model metre scale the second test model model bedset is based on an outcrop map of a metre scale heterogeneous intertidal sandstone deposit at barranca los lores argentina it consists of a facies association of clean and muddy sandstone representing a former a tidal channel sleveland et al 2020 figs 7 and 8 illustrate the layered structure of the sandstone deposit the permeability of the clean sandstone is 1 0 d five times higher than the value measured for the muddy sandstone which also has a higher capillary entry pressure 2500 pa vs 500 pa refer to table 3 model bedset was treated as a vertical cross section through the sandstone deposit and discretised with a triangular fe mesh fig 8 the regions of clean sandstone are discretised with 12029 triangular elements and those representing muddy sandstone with 41023 triangular elements a preprocessing step matched the nodes on the top and bottom sides of the model to be able to apply periodic boundary condition for vertical flow while the vertical flow rate through the model was varied the side boundaries were treated as closed the input capillary pressure and relative permeability curves are shown in figs 9 and 10 4 results fig 11 compares the gas saturation distribution computed with dfefvm flow solver with that in the hele shaw cell of al wahaibi et al 2005 at selected pore volumes injected pvi a white grey blue colour scheme was chosen to ease the comparison between the physical and the numeric results a very good match of the saturation distribution is obtained except for the area immediately above the bottom set where there appears to be a transition zone in the hele shaw cell and the gas saturation is lower in the other model regions the dfevm solver accurately captures the saturation magnitudes the saturation fronts the smooth saturation distributions within the coarse more permeable bead pack and the sharp saturation gradients at the interfaces between the foresets in the far right column of fig 11 simulations are shown that were conducted by al wahaibi et al 2005 with a commercial reservoir simulator these visualisations use a rainbow colour scheme as in the original article because we did not have access to the underpinning data while this makes a direct comparison difficult a number of first order differences are clear there is a significant mismatch between the physical experiment and the simulation not only in terms of the reduced gas migration speed in the inclined layers but there are gas incursions into the bottom set not seen in the experiments and the saturation fronts are smeared in the simulation and lack the channelling by the material interfaces this comparison highlights that the dfefvm flow solver is capable of simulating saturation distributions that closely match multi media physical experiments both qualitatively and quantitatively this physical realism exceeds that which can be obtained with the reservoir simulator that is most commonly used in upscaling studies especially with regard to the resolution of material interfaces the analysis herein confirms similar findings made in an earlier study with a heuristic model youssef et al 2021 4 1 laminated quartz sandstone model core2d 4 1 1 upscaled absolute permeability tensor the equivalent permeability tensor of model core2d was determined with the standard steady state procedure for single phase simulation section 2 2 for flow in the horizontal direction the preferred flow paths are in layers 0 and 9 where the permeability is high fig 12 the average velocity m s and pressure gradient pa m computed in this direction are u x x 9 21367 1 0 5 u y x 4 2531 1 0 7 m s and p x x 19753 8 p x y 22 1302 1 0 7 pa for flow in the vertical direction the velocity field is rather uniform the average velocity and pressure gradient computed in this direction are u y x 8 0199 1 0 8 u y y 2 5815 1 0 5 m s and p y x 60 7704 p y y 7142 72 pa the equivalent permeability computed by numeric simulation is k 4 7027 0 0259 0 0259 3 6144 1 0 12 m 2 the two eigenvalues or this tensor are λ 1 4 7033 1 0 12 m 2 and λ 2 3 6138 1 0 12 m 2 the longitudinal and latitudinal components of the equivalent permeability tensor for this layered porous medium can be estimated from dagan 1985 bear 1993 k x x r e f i 1 n k i t i i 1 n t i 4 7034 1 0 12 m 2 k y y r e f i 1 n t i i 1 n t i k i 3 6055 1 0 12 m 2 k x y r e f k y x r e f 0 m 2 where k i and t i are layer permeability and thickness respectively it can be seen that the equivalent permeability computed by the two methods are almost identical this good match is due to the uniform thickness and small inclination of the laminations 4 1 2 equivalent relative permeability following the procedure section 2 2 forward transport simulations were conducted to determine the equivalent relative permeability of the model in all runs gravity was enabled but had little effect on the saturation distribution due to the small size of the model in the low rate scenario initially uniform saturation values change considerably within the first minute fig 13 saturation jumps evolve at the material interfaces and the rock layers become visible in the saturation pattern due to the high permeability of the sample a steady state saturation pattern is reached after 180 min fig 14 already after the first hour the co 2 saturation distribution barely changes however the equilibration process is asymptotic and it takes two more hours until the termination criterion for the simulation is met running the simulation even longer there is a very gradual minor magnification of the saturation differences between the layers experimentation with different random initial saturation distributions and correlation lengths to determine whether the obtained pseudo steady state saturation depends on initial saturation did not identify such a dependence this is corroborated by the findings summarised in berg and ott 2012 fig 15 illustrates the saturation distributions obtained for different mean s n values at the low flow rate the obtained patterns reflects the laminated structure of the sandstone there is a slight asymmetry with elevated co 2 saturation values upstream of the layers with a high capillary entry pressure this asymmetry within individual layers marks the flow direction and scales in magnitude with the flow rate as will be shown further below the equivalent relative permeability computed from these saturation patterns is aligned with the model so that the tensor has a diagonal form as shown in fig 18 when s w is below 0 1 the equivalent curve k r n y y that represents the tensor s eigenvalue in the vertical direction is identical to that of all layers the non wetting phase is continuous across the entire model there is no capillary locking at any saturation state essentially this ensemble curve is similar to that of the capillary limit model when s w increases however k r n y y is shifted below the lower bounding curve as shown in fig 15 co 2 eventually accumulates upstream of the high entry pressure layers although high co 2 saturations imply greater total mobility due to its low viscosity capillary trapping halts the flow in the vertical direction and co 2 mobility drops to zero the higher s w the stronger the capillary trapping effect when it occurs at s w 0 6 the co 2 distribution is discontinuous at several material interfaces this capillary trapping implies a high macroscopic residual saturation of co 2 as long as gravitational or viscous forces are small given the frequently observed inverse correlation between permeability and entry pressure the mobility of co 2 in core2d depends on the permeability distribution the higher the permeability the lower the entry pressure the low viscosity of co 2 locally pushes total mobility to very high values creating preferential paths in the model aligned with the horizontal direction as a result while the equivalent vertical relative permeability reduces during saturation build up which is enhanced by gravitational segregation the horizontal one increases correspondingly fig 18 for this low rate setup the non wetting phase relative permeability curves computed by our new method and the capillary limit approximation are in good agreement over the whole saturation range notwithstanding a small deviation emerges at high water saturations when capillary trapping dominates the system behaviour in the high flow rate scenario the model shows a different co 2 distribution pattern figs 16 and 17 the strong pressure gradient maintains flow across the laminae at all saturations although some capillary hold up is visible fluid pressure remains continuous no capillary end effects can be observed and saturation varies freely along the periodic top and bottom boundaries the ensemble relative permeability curves stay within the bounds determined by the relative permeability curves of layers 3 and 5 fig 19 unlike the low flow rate scenario the results obtained by the two methods steady state vl and our method are closely matched over the whole saturation range 4 1 3 equivalent capillary pressure we used a volume weighted averaging method to compute capillary pressure curves in the domain for both cl and vl conditions the capillary pressure values at the finite element nodes are computed from the phase distributions fig 20 the cl and vl curves share the same entry pressure but a discrepancy becomes visible as the water saturation diminishes in the cl approximation most of the co 2 stays in the low capillary pressure layers resulting in the blue curve by contrast in the vl approximation co 2 is distributed throughout the domain resulting in a higher average capillary pressure red curve when the saturation of co 2 is higher both curves match suggesting that the distribution of co 2 no longer significantly impacts overall capillary pressure within the domain in the simulations with core2d we did not notice capillary pressure hysteresis 4 1 4 simulation speed the execution time for the cl and vl approximations is always nearly the same and many orders of magnitude faster than our flow based method table 4 the dfefvm solver also requires more execution time in the high than in the low rate scenario this is because it uses an impes scheme for time marching subject to the courant fredrich levy cfl condition which is more stringent for flow velocities although our flow solver is slower than the cl or vl calculations the advantage is that its application is not restricted to the cl and vl force balance end member cases and it also permits the consideration of gravitational forces 4 2 intertidal layered sandstone model bedset for an initial total saturation of co 2 of 0 4 and without gravity the co 2 saturation in the model stabilises after two days fig 21a subsequent minor saturation redistribution by capillary spreading takes many days due to the much larger model size due to the pronounced capillary pressure contrasts between the different facies types of the sandstone co 2 saturation builds up ahead of the muddy intervals again the effect of the material interfaces is captured well by the flow solver co 2 accumulates in the uppermost parts of the clean sandstone layers forming very thin rims from there it leaks downstream at preferential locations yellow haloes fig 19 coinciding with minor kinks in these layers the co 2 buildup in the clean sandstone is more pronounced when gravity is enabled similar to model core2d the trapped co 2 concentrates in the high permeability layers where it promotes a high layer parallel co 2 mobility the thin layers of co 2 therefore become preferential co 2 pathways when a horizontal pressure gradient exists it follows that the relative permeability of the non wetting phase is amplified fig 22a the relative permeability curve of water is not too different for the gravity free case probably because the highly permeable clean sand is less volumetrically important than the more permeable layers in model core2d in model bedset the muddy sands account for approximately 78 of the model area accommodating most of the co 2 the buoyancy force accelerates the phase redistribution process during vertical flow co 2 breakthrough occurs only in the arched portions of the material interfaces where the co 2 accumulations are the thickest the rest of the material interfaces are blocked by capillary sealing lowering the relative permeability of both phases fig 22b these results for vertical flow on the metre scale indicate that the barrier effect of facies interfaces is strong fig 21 again co 2 accumulation promotes a high horizontal total mobility amplifying the relative permeability of the non wetting phase fig 22a 5 discussion the forward simulation setup described herein differs from the uniform inflow constant fractional flow setup that is typically applied in numeric and physical experiments where wetting and non wetting phases are injected into the sample at a constant phase ratio blunt 2017 in physical experiments porous plates are used to achieve such conditions the termination criterion indicating when internal force balance equilibrium is obtained in this common setup is taken as the time when the inlet bulk fractional flow matches that at the outlet at this point in time the relative permeability is calculated however as discussed in the introduction these boundary conditions are unrealistic for heterogeneous rocks and this setup is prone to capillary end effects that can distort the saturation distribution in the sample or model for homogeneous rocks capillary end effects can be avoided by matching the capillary pressure plateau of the porous plate to that of the rock this is not always possible and impossible for heterogeneous rocks and rock composites because capillary pressure curves vary across inlet and outlet the advantages of a similar direct numeric simulation procedure based on unsteady flow in a dynamic network model including the use of periodic boundary conditions in the flow direction are demonstrated by gjennestad et al 2020 the use of periodic boundary conditions removes the artificial uniformity of inlet fractional flows and the capillary end effect which have long been a concern and blamed for what was perceived at the time as an apparent rate dependency e g osoba et al 1951 thanks to the application of periodic boundary conditions to the saturation transport equation we can exclude this possibility the outflux from truncated finite volumes at the downstream boundary becomes the influx into the other half of these fvs located at the inlet boundary representing the same petrotype thus the fluid phases can be recirculated through the model while the total phase volumes remain unchanged as compared with the fractional flow approach it is advantageous also that the simulations start with fully satiated conditions i e the phases are interconnected across the sample arguably this makes the results more reproducible simulating merely the redistribution of phases within the model for an initial saturation distribution close to the final one also accelerates convergence especially for highly heterogeneous systems where the simulation of the passage of the saturation front through the model would take a long time compared to steady state upscaling of heterogeneous porous media which rests on the assumption that the saturation distribution is controlled by capillary or viscous forces only the presented workflow allows consideration of complex saturation distributions that arise from the combined effects of viscous gravity and capillary forces relaxing the cl and vl assumptions comes at the extra cost of flow simulation yet our new approach reduces computational cost because only the modification of an initial saturation distribution is required as opposed to a full forward simulation this is advantageous also because it overcomes problematic issues such as finite scale effects that are well known from core flooding experiments osoba et al 1951 li and sheng 2016 while our approach is flow based it shows a good agreement with the capillary limit approach for capillary dominated flow and with the viscous limit approach for viscous dominated flows both methods capture the effect of material interfaces but only the flow based method addresses the asymmetry of saturation distributions at intermediate force balances as demonstrated both methods can be combined using a cl saturation distribution as an initial guess for the flow based upscaling as shown this benefits computation efficiency for conditions between the cl and vl that can only be explored with a flow based method the models presented here do not feature representative elementary volumes revs of the investigated heterogeneous porous media so there is no separation of scale between model size and that of the incorporated laminations and bedforms for this reason one can rightly argue that they are not suitable for upscaling i e the equivalent properties derived are not effective medium properties analysing rev scale three dimensional models is the subject of a ongoing separate study youssef et al 2022 the equilibration distance that is often estimated by back of the envelope calculations to predetermine the size of the models for the numeric experiments in actuality is heterogeneity flow rate and flow direction dependent any coarsening instabilities that will arise during the unstable displacement of brine by co 2 are not considered by steady state upscaling setups berg and ott 2012 these limitations may also be overcome and the complexity seen may be handled by the new analysis approach because of its greater flexibility that allows the automation of sensitivity analysis studies on large samples whereas in the lab one individual core flooding experiment at a single flow rate of interest would take months to complete honarpour et al 1995 seyyedi et al 2022 since equivalent relative permeability is derived from the spatial saturation distribution in the model the accuracy of the measurement of this parameter depends on the physical realism of the multiphase flow simulation if the solver fails to capture the different possible states of capillary discontinuities this will diminish or eliminate the sensitivity to small scale heterogeneity and flow regime the simulation lab experiment study of al wahaibi and co workers 2005 highlights that standard reservoir simulators are not necessarily suited for core scale numeric simulation and can fail to reproduce the saturation distributions seen in physical experiments fig 11 an explanation for this mismatch may include 1 the common global pressure treatment of capillary pressure in the governing equations that relies on capillary pressure saturation equilibrium aziz and settari 1979 li et al 2003 and 2 the representation of material interfaces that lacks the extra pressure degree of freedom needed to model the scenario where total pressure evolves independently on either side of a transient capillary membrane seal watts 1987 tran et al 2020 s dfefvm scheme used here overcomes these deficiencies and their nonlinear iterative interface coupling scheme can even resolve the transient valve like behaviour seen in some experiments benzing et al 1996 finally it is worth noting that it may be challenging to find sample geometries that have the symmetry necessary to apply periodic boundary conditions e g durlofsky 2005 this was frequently possible for the heterogeneous core samples that this method has been developed for but when this condition is not satisfied the medium can be made periodic using one of two methods translation whitaker 1986 or symmetry guibert et al 2016 6 conclusions this paper presents a new method for the computation of equivalent relative permeability in heterogeneous porous media upscaling is performed numerically using a multiphase flow solver based on a hybrid finite element finite volume discretisation with embedded discontinuities this flow solver underpins a workflow for the generation of steady state saturation distributions evolved from prescribed initial phase distributions matching a given bulk saturation of interest the steady state saturation distributions ensue from fluid recirculation through the model for a prescribed balance of viscous gravitational and capillary forces this recirculation is facilitated by periodic boundary conditions when the saturation distribution reaches its pseudo steady state the equivalent relative permeability is determined from finite element volume weighted average phase velocities pressure gradients and viscosities as well as the equivalent absolute permeability tensor repeating this process for different saturation values the relative permeability curves that typify the flow regime of interest are constructed the ability of the flow solver to produce realistic saturation distributions is tested by simulating a well documented hele shaw cell experiment with a model that contains discrete material interfaces the upscaling procedure is illustrated for two models at different length scales the first is a laminated quartz sandstone from the precipice sandstone in the surat basin in queensland a potential co 2 storage site and the second is an outcrop analogue model from argentina results obtained for these models indicate a flow rate and direction dependent relative permeability and no flow or even intermittent episodic flow behaviour at some conditions key observations made are the obtained equivalent flow properties capture the impact of core scale heterogeneity for field scale numeric simulations and have the potential to improve the physical realism of field scale predictive simulations equivalent relative permeability functions require the additional parameters phase velocity magnitude and phase flow direction to capture the observed variability in the conducted capillary limit runs ensemble curves do not stay within bounds determined by volume averaging of the constituent rock types in highly permeable samples gravity starts to affect saturation distributions at a scale above 10 cm with gravity non wetting phase cross layer relative permeability is lower than without the periodic boundary setup for the saturation equation permits to overcome boundary artefacts and limitations of capillary or viscous limit upscaling techniques and determining the curves of interest by direct numeric simulation permits to extend sample size and parameter space beyond the limits of physical experimentation credit

36,performance assessment of co 2 storage sites requires realistic modelling of the impact of heterogeneous aquifer properties on brine co 2 flow heterogeneity gives rise to non uniform saturation distributions that are affected by the balance of capillary gravitational and viscous forces since equivalent relative permeability and capillary pressure depend on saturation their shape also varies with flow rate and gravitational phase segregation this must be considered during performance assessment here we present a new workflow for the computation of equivalent relative permeability from force balance controlled saturation distributions in heterogeneous rocks computed with a novel continuum scale flow solver with special provisions for material interfaces instead of simulating core flooding the solver is used to recirculate phases across periodic boundaries until their distribution is in equilibrium with the applied forces our workflow is demonstrated on a segmented x ray scan of a core sample of a laminated sandstone from a potential co 2 storage site in the surat basin australia and an outcrop analogue model from argentina this application highlights how heterogeneity manifests in multi phase flow functions confirming rate dependence after eliminating capillary end effects keywords two phase flow steady state upscaling relative permeability capillary heterogeneity heterogeneous porous media data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction pore scale heterogeneity and bedforms in sandstone can now be recorded accurately by x ray scanning and subsequent segmentation e g turner et al 2004 knackstedt et al 2006 the multi phase fluid flow properties of constituent rocktypes can be analysed by pore network modelling fatt 1956 knackstedt et al 2001 xiong et al 2016 yet the ensemble multiphase flow properties of such composite rock types that manifest nonuniform saturation distributions remain relatively poorly understood advanced imaging of multiphase flow through heterogeneous rocks e g kulkarni et al 1998 turner et al 2004 tang and kovscek 2011 krevor et al 2011 leu et al 2014 herring et al 2016 aljasmi and sahimi 2020 has revealed the limitations of classic saturation functions it now appears that the long held assumption that capillary forces control the spatial saturation distribution only holds at the mm scale it follows that establishing a rigorous modelling and numeric simulation workflow which simultaneously considers information from the lower limit of imaging resolution to the representative elementary volume rev scale of heterogeneous porous media has become a major research objective e g huang et al 1995 durlofsky 1997 virnovsky et al 2004 rustad et al 2008 kuo and benson 2021 berg and ott 2012 rabinovich et al 2015 jackson et al 2018 ruspini et al 2021 the aim is to predict ensemble flow behaviour without constructing andcomputing costly fine scale representations of heterogeneous porous media the aforementioned publications describe different methods for this purpose there are many approaches highlighting the importance of saturation functions 1 ones that predict spatial saturation distributions relying on the capillary pressure equilibrium or viscous limit assumption e g ekrann and aasen 2000 or iteratively for some externally applied pressure gradient virnovsky et al 2004 lohne et al 2004 2 semi analytical approaches darman et al 2002 rabinovich and cheng 2020 cheng and rabinovich 2020 moreno and rabinovich 2021 and 3 forward flow simulation based ones kyte and berry 1975 zhang et al 2008 sheng et al 2011 boon et al 2022a that predict spatial saturation distributions by forward simulation as remarked by durlofsky 1997 with reference to the pseudo relative permeability of heterogeneous composites of porous rocks the traditional functional form of saturation functions is too limited to capture observed behaviour and instead an extended description is needed taking into account the spatial variance of saturation and velocity saturation covariance durlofsky 1997 and as seen in physical experiments caudle et al 1951 henderson et al 1998 skauge and poulsen 2000 perrin et al 2009 krause 2012 krause and benson 2015 jackson et al 2018 kuo and benson 2021 rabinovich et al 2015 relative permeability is rate dependent this has also been illustrated numerically darman et al 2002 virnovsky et al 2004 lohne et al 2006 the recent field data based simulation research of shao et al 2021 and shao et al 2022 also indicates flow rate dependence they argue that this property is required to capture the flow behaviour of laminated sandstone composites accurately mishra et al 2020 and use sector scale simulations to demonstrate that consideration of this behaviour maps to differences in plume shape and saturation distributions in the storage site shao et al 2021 rate dependence has been explained by different mechanisms low rate curves differ from high rate curves because capillary trapping occurs in the samples e g rabinovich et al 2015 commonly these differences are modelled distinguishing viscous limit vl flow from capillary limit cl end member cases in the vl idealisation capillary and gravitational forces are ignored so that total mobility is influenced by saturation only due to the viscosity contrast between the phases since fractional flow is constant along streamlines for this assumption saturation distributions can be constructed tracing these starting at the inlet where fractional flow is prescribed again relative permeability is calculated from the ensuing saturation distributions ekrann and aasen 2000 pickup and hern 2002 kløv et al 2003 virnovsky et al 2004 rustad et al 2008 vl and cl approximations permit to determine bounding curves for rate dependent relative permeability it is unrealistic however to prescribe uniform constant fractional inflows to heterogeneous porous media in which saturation and flow velocity vary spatially matthai and burney 2019 this variability also implies that force balances will vary and cl regions may co exist with vl ones although reasonably accurate approximations have been presented in the literature e g virnovsky et al 2004 lohne et al 2006 rabinovich et al 2015 the cooperative behaviour that controls the shape of ensemble relative permeability and capillary pressure curves in this scenario still warrants further investigation since flow based upscaling involves numeric simulation its results also depend on the physical realism of the simulator i e how it approximates viscous gravitational and capillary driven flows gravitational phase segregation and filtration at material interfaces as well as capillary barrier formation input models also need to be sufficiently refined to represent both their geometric features and those of the saturation distribution within them standard simulators rely on regular grids saturation is treated as piecewise constant and fluxes are derived by first order two point flux approximation tpfa based on transmissibility multipliers generated by harmonic averaging of the properties of adjacent cells chen et al 1993 document that this framework produces first order grid orientation artefacts i e preferential flow along the grid axes youssef et al 2021 quantify the high level of refinement needed by this approach for obtaining grid convergence of saturation in the presence of gravitational forces they also describe breaches of capillary barriers that occurred although their entry pressure had not been exceeded in summary these observations indicate that there is scope for improvement of the numeric methods that predict non uniform saturation patterns in composite rocks with bed form heterogeneity here we present an alternative flow based method for extracting ensemble relative permeability curves from numeric simulations applied to models of heterogeneous sandstone composites which consist of different petrotypes with unique single and multiphase flow properties e g mishra et al 2020 the composites are characterised by x ray scanning and segmentation øren et al 2019 and the flow properties of their constituent rock types are determined by pore network modelling bakke and øren 1997 øren et al 2019 relative permeability on the continuum scale is computed from saturation distributions derived from forward simulations with a new geometrically more flexible numeric simulator with special provisions for material interfaces tran et al 2020 honouring the viscous capillary interface conditions van duijn and de neef 1998 can the aforementioned issues with the constant fractional flow boundary conditions be overcome by changing the setup of the computer simulations unlike for inlet fractional flow based methods simulations are started with a uniform or capillary limit saturation distribution re distributing phases while honouring periodic boundary conditions for the saturation equation periodicity ascertains that total saturation stays constant during phase redistribution simulations continue until a steady state is obtained and the saturation distribution is in equilibrium with the applied force balances ensemble relative permeability is calculated by volume averaging of phase velocity and phase pressure gradients forward simulation and analysis steps are repeated across the saturation range of interest at saturation increments sufficiently small to get well defined relative permeability curves for some prescribed saturation values there will be no flow when this occurs the threshold far field pressure gradient which needs to be exceeded to generate flow across the composite i e to create satiated conditions is recorded this novel workflow and relative permeability analysis method is demonstrated on a model of a segmented scan of sandstone core from the precipice formation surat basin australia and an outcrop analogue model of a layered sandstone from chile to further enhance confidence in and to better illustrate the advantages of the new flow solver that we have developed to compute the saturation distributions a direct comparison with results obtained for a hele shaw cell model of cross bedded sandstone and with a standard reservoir simulator are presented at the beginning of the results section al wahaibi et al 2005 this paper is structured as follows a methodology section describes the new upscaling workflow including model setup application of initial and periodic boundary conditions and steps needed to calculate equivalent relative permeability and capillary pressure curves next a core plug and an outcrop analogue demonstration model are presented followed by an analysis of their single and multi phase flow properties saturation patterns and ensemble relative permeability as determined by application of our new workflow 2 methodology our new method forms part of a new largely automated upscaling workflow which was developed in a joint project with researchers at the australian national university csiro perth and petricore norway knackstedt 2020 while anu and their norwegian partners focused on the scanning and segmentation of the core samples and the calculation of saturation functions for constituent petrotypes using pore network modelling respectively bakke and øren 1997 ramstad et al 2012 our work employed their results to parameterise continuum scale models with embedded discontinuities aimed at gaining an understanding of the dynamics of multiphase flow in the whole core and its equivalent properties fig 1 network model derived saturation functions of constituent petrotypes provide the input for our whole core models and flow solver while the input saturation functions were generated relying on the cl assumption that capillary forces control the saturation distribution the whole core functions were derived from saturation distributions arrived at by numeric flow simulation employing the upscaling approach described in the following this approach permits the variation of the balances between viscous externally applied pressure gradients gravitational buoyancy and capillary forces entry pressure constraints and capillary pressure saturation derivatives determined from the capillary pressure curves of the constituent petrotypes due to the heterogeneity of the core the magnitude of the ensuing flow regime aware functions also depends on flow direction and phase velocity boon and benson 2021 these extra features permit the australian carbon geo sequestration simulator acgss shao et al 2021 to reproduce the behaviour of interest at the field scale complementary to the cl and vl saturation functions developed by other members of the team ruspini et al 2021 we will show that the flow simulation based functions are applicable to displacement that occurs in flow regimes between these limits and including conditions where the displacing phase is more mobile than the displaced phase e g lake 1989 this is relevant because supercritical co 2 is more mobile than formation brine so that coarsening instabilities can control the shape of the plume berg and ott 2012 nicolaides et al 2015 in summary the flow based upscaling from the petrotype to the whole core and borehole periphery scale is enabled by the new workflow and approach described and demonstrated herein building on the overall pore to core well spot scale imaging segmentation and analysis workflow developed by knackstedt 2020 see fig 1 2 1 flow solver the multi phase flow solver for the simulation of the potentially non uniform saturation distributions is implemented using a hybrid finite element finite volume fefv collocated finite element finite volume mesh framework fig 2a operator splitting is performed to solve the elliptic pressure equation with the finite element method and the hyperbolic transport equations with the finite volume method cordes and kinzelbach 1992 geiger et al 2004 paluszny et al 2007 among other benefits this unstructured spatially adaptive discretisation facilitates the accurate representation of bedforms and irregularly shaped laminations vughs and other geologic features within a complex geometry in three dimensions while existing bedform modelling techniques facilitate the construction of corner point grids that even conform to pinchouts of layers nordahl and ringrose 2008 the main purpose of such regularised representations is cl and vl upscaling and volumetrics as a consequence these grids lack the local refinement needed to resolve both flow geometry and the saturation patterns that will emerge in the simulation to accurately model phase selective fluid transfer i e filtration by material interfaces the basic fefv method is extended into a discontinuous finite element finite volume method dfefvm fig 2b nick and matthäi 2011a b tran et al 2020 embedding material interfaces as boundaries endowed with additional degrees of freedom for pressure and saturation the interface coupling scheme of tran et al 2020 implements the interface transfer conditions van duijn and de neef 1998 accurately resolving nonlinear viscous capillary interface transfer spontaneous imbibition and filtration that may lead to jump discontinuities in pressure and saturation a change of variables from saturation to capillary pressure and vice versa is performed where and when the spatial gradient of either variable becomes small accelerating convergence this implementation facilitates the accurate modelling of relaxation oscillations that can occur when the non wetting phase accumulates upstream of an increased entry pressure layer eventually choking off any flow across this boundary benzing et al 1996 in this situation a continuous upstream fluid supply will promote pressure buildup until the petrotype s entry pressure is exceeded and the capillary blockage breaks down releasing the non wetting phase downstream this release is associated with a pressure drop for a constant rate upstream fluid supply this process will repeat itself 2 2 upscaling homogenisation procedure the proposed steady state upscaling procedure for determining the equivalent relative permeability of heterogeneous composites of different rock types involves three steps 1 compute steady state single phase fluid pressure distributions and post process flow velocities to constrain the equivalent permeability tensor k 2 perform two phase fluid flow and transport simulations computing the fluid saturation distributions from which equivalent phase permeabilities k α are calculated repeat this for different average saturation values spanning the range of interest 3 evaluate the equivalent relative permeability curves k r α s w v t using the equivalent permeability from 1 each of the saturation distributions computed in step 2 represents the steady state that persists given the applied magnitudes of viscous gravitational and capillary forces 2 2 1 evaluating the effective permeability tensor the effective permeability tensor computation step 1 follows the non local permeability upscaling approach of durlofsky 1991 for simplicity it is illustrated here for two dimensional models 1 apply the pressure differential δ p x on the opposing left and right boundaries of the rectangular model and no flow boundary conditions or a linear pressure interpolation to the remaining boundaries fig 3 subscripts x y indicate the direction of the resulting pressure gradient 2 compute the pressure field in the model with a linear finite element method lfem and post process it to determine the local pressure gradients p x i p x i x p x i y in each finite element i 3 compute the flow velocity u x i u x i x u x i y in each finite element i from darcy s law 4 compute the volume weighted average velocity u x u x x u x y and pressure gradient p x p x x p x y in the model as 1 u x x u x y 1 i 1 n v i i 1 n u x i x v i i 1 n u x i y v i 2 p x x p x y 1 i 1 n v i i 1 n p x i x v i i 1 n p x i y v i where v i is the volume of finite element i and n is the number of elements in the domain 5 rotate the boundary conditions apply the pressure differential δ p y between the top and bottom sides of the model and no flow conditions to the remaining sides 6 compute the pressure field and post process it to obtain the volume weighted average velocities u y u y x u y y and pressure gradients p y p y x p y y as already described in steps 2 3 and 4 7 the equivalent permeability tensor is computed by solving the linear system of equations 3 p x x p x y 0 0 0 0 p x x p x y p y x p y y 0 0 0 0 p y x p y y 0 1 1 0 k x x k x y k y x k y y μ u x x u x y u y x u y y 0 where μ is the fluid viscosity which is assigned a constant value it is worth noting that the symmetry of the equivalent permeability tensor extra equation in algebraic system can be imposed as an additional constraint k x y k y x we do not impose this symmetry constraint but check our solution that it satisfies it 2 2 2 evaluating the equivalent relative permeability while capillary limit upscaling leads to a unique saturation distribution for any chosen value of capillary pressure e g ekrann and aasen 2000 relaxing this assumption admits different distributions depending on the balances between the capillary viscous and gravitational forces to obtain such distributions forward multiphase simulation is required in the presence of material interfaces the drainage process will produce different saturation distributions dependent on whether capillary barriers arise during phase redistribution or are breached by it e g tran et al 2020 this implies that saturation distributions can also be path dependent continuous capillary barriers formed during a flow simulation will block the flow so that the equivalent permeability is zero for the corresponding average saturation and magnitude of forces the pressure differential across the model below which this blockage occurs is recorded as the threshold capillary pressure of the rock composite e g shosa and cathles 2001 to ascertain reproducibility of the saturation distributions the new flow simulation procedure that we have developed relies on periodic boundary conditions for the saturation equation forward simulation starts with a plausible initial saturation distribution such as a potentially uniform saturation for conditions near the viscous limit or the capillary limit distribution for conditions near the cl clearly this initialisation must not violate the end point saturations of the constituent petrotypes of the model the relative proportions of the different petrotypes therefore determine the saturation endpoints of the ensemble for the applied force balances the fluid phases are recirculated through the periodic boundaries of the model fig 4 and the saturation distribution evolves from its initial state to the new equilibrium state the computational effort required and the physical time that elapses during this process depends on model size and the distance from the final state since this process is asymptotic a termination criterion needs to be defined like in predictor corrector methods we use the maximum saturation change that occurs in any cell of the model over time in summary we propose a steady state relative permeability upscaling procedure that entails the following steps 1 assign compute the initial saturation distribution s w to the finite volume cells across the domain honouring the capillary limit saturation endpoints of the constituent rock types note that these cells are centred on the nodes of the collocated finite element mesh on the nodes of which fluid pressure is computed 2 assign periodic boundary conditions for saturation to the finite volumes on opposing sides of the model and no flow boundary conditions to any remaining ones this requires that the nodes and finite volumes on the opposing boundaries are matched and that the model geometry is matched as well otherwise saturation artefacts will arise at the ensuing discontinuities 3 apply an initial guess of the pressure differential between the nodes matching across the periodic boundaries to create the desired level of viscous forces due to the nonlinearity of total mobility finding the pressure drop that generates the bulk flow rate of interest may require iteration 4 define an exit criterion for the simulation here a maximum 1 change of saturation in any petrotype of the model between two consecutive pressure solves is taken 5 the phase permeability of phase α that is a piece wise constant property of the finite element e as a function of water saturation then becomes 4 k α e s w e k r α s w e k e where s w e is the water saturation interpolated to the finite elements integration points because material properties are discretised as piecewise constant on the finite elements 6 use the same procedure to that described in section 2 2 1 to evaluate the equivalent phase permeability tensor k α s w or the scalar equivalent phase permeability in the case of a one dimensional setup 7 the equivalent phase relative permeability tensor in the model is then determined by 5 k r α s w k α s w k 1 where k is the effective intrinsic permeability tensor of the model computed as explained in section 2 2 1 note that the eigenvalues of the relative permeability tensor correspond to the equivalent ensemble relative permeability in the corresponding coordinate direction of the model in the case where the tensor is diagonal i e aligned with the coordinate axes 8 repeat this sequence of steps for different initial saturations s w choosing sufficiently small increments to span the saturation range constrained by the endpoint saturations of the constituent rock types how small the saturation increments need to be is a trade off between the desired relative permeability curves smoothness and the computational effort that is invested apart from relative permeability equivalent capillary pressure curves are needed so that the upscaled properties can be used for sector scale and field scale simulation in the capillary limit there exists a unique relationship between capillary pressure and saturation the aforementioned threshold pressure of the composite can be used as its capillary entry pressure noting that in anisotropic samples especially those with through going laminations its value will vary with the direction of the pressure gradient shao et al 2022 show that this dependence can be implemented in a reservoir simulator by interpolating entry pressure values between the layer parallel and layer perpendicular end member cases considering the local direction of flow in the presence of viscous and gravitational forces capillary pressure is no longer uniform even at fully satiated conditions in this case we simply compute the finite volume weighted average of capillary pressure in the model from the equilibrium saturation distribution finally it is worth noting that these relative permeability and capillary pressure computations are readily automated and near the capillary limit the extra computational effort required as compared to steady state upscaling is small although models sufficiently refined for flow simulation are required 3 demonstration models prior to its application to the relative permeability upscaling of heterogeneous rock composites the realism of the saturation distributions obtained with the new flow solver was tested by a comparison with physical experiments carried out on a hele shaw cell model of cross bedded sand al wahaibi et al 2005 see fig 11 in this 13 25 cm model coarse fine foresets and a bottom set were created by depositing graded glass beads the capillary entry pressure of the resulting bead packs varies between 770 and 2400 pascals and their permeability from 10 to 250 darcies in the experiment non wetting phase gas dyed blue was injected at a constant rate through the left boundary displacing an oleic proxy reservoir fluid the bottom and top boundaries were kept closed and the right boundary was maintained at a constant fluid static pressure the calculation of equivalent relative permeability curves is illustrated with two models although we have successfully applied the procedure to three dimensional models fig 1 for simplicity the models discussed here are in 2d the first one is based on a 14 cm tall 5 cm wide segmented x ray scan of a sample from a well drilled into the precipice sandstone in the surat basin qld australia knackstedt 2020 ruspini et al 2021 the second two dimensional model was built from an outcrop of intertidal sandstones in argentina sleveland et al 2020 3 1 laminated sandstone model cm scale fig 5 shows the laminated quartz sandstone model core2d it consists of four different petrotypes forming 10 subhorizontal laminations the input data for this upscaling simulation porosity permeability brooks corey parameter were extracted from the x ray tomographic image while the capillary and relative permeabilty curves were computed by network modelling this explains the unusually high precision given in table 1 it has to be stressed that these values do not translate into accuracy because of the natural variability of the sandstone the reader is referred to øren et al 2019 for the detailed analysis procedure and justification of the precision of the given values the brooks corey model was used to model the relative permeability and capillary pressure of the petrotypes in this sample the mean pore size and its distribution determined from the x ray images were used to calculate porosity and permeability øren et al 2019 see table 1 and table 2 the permeability of the sandstone is very high spanning a narrow range between 2 and 11 darcys porosity ranges between 24 and 28 the quartz clasts are angular yet the sandstone is relatively well sorted this is reflected in the brooks corey parameter λ values layers 3 and 5 have the highest and lowest values of this pore size distribution related parameter the capillary entry pressure varies between 0 3 kpa and 1 2 kpa among the petrotypes layers 0 5 and 7 have the highest values 1 kpa equivalent to co 2 column heights greater than 23 cm for the given density contrast between the co 2 and brine to perform the upscaling simulations a triangular mesh was built conforming to the material interfaces in the laminated core sample fig 6 model core2d was discretised using 4296 triangular elements split boundaries were inserted between all laminations to accurately model these material interfaces two sets of simulations were run to assess the effect of flow rate on the equivalent relative permeability in the first set a small pressure difference of 1 5 kpa was applied between the bottom and top of the model to model a near capillary limit scenario while ascertaining flow in the second set a pressure difference of 10 kpa was used to model significant viscous forces n c a p 1 1 0 4 two sets of simulations were conducted one with and another without gravitational forces to see whether these had any influence on the saturation distribution 3 2 intertidal sandstone model metre scale the second test model model bedset is based on an outcrop map of a metre scale heterogeneous intertidal sandstone deposit at barranca los lores argentina it consists of a facies association of clean and muddy sandstone representing a former a tidal channel sleveland et al 2020 figs 7 and 8 illustrate the layered structure of the sandstone deposit the permeability of the clean sandstone is 1 0 d five times higher than the value measured for the muddy sandstone which also has a higher capillary entry pressure 2500 pa vs 500 pa refer to table 3 model bedset was treated as a vertical cross section through the sandstone deposit and discretised with a triangular fe mesh fig 8 the regions of clean sandstone are discretised with 12029 triangular elements and those representing muddy sandstone with 41023 triangular elements a preprocessing step matched the nodes on the top and bottom sides of the model to be able to apply periodic boundary condition for vertical flow while the vertical flow rate through the model was varied the side boundaries were treated as closed the input capillary pressure and relative permeability curves are shown in figs 9 and 10 4 results fig 11 compares the gas saturation distribution computed with dfefvm flow solver with that in the hele shaw cell of al wahaibi et al 2005 at selected pore volumes injected pvi a white grey blue colour scheme was chosen to ease the comparison between the physical and the numeric results a very good match of the saturation distribution is obtained except for the area immediately above the bottom set where there appears to be a transition zone in the hele shaw cell and the gas saturation is lower in the other model regions the dfevm solver accurately captures the saturation magnitudes the saturation fronts the smooth saturation distributions within the coarse more permeable bead pack and the sharp saturation gradients at the interfaces between the foresets in the far right column of fig 11 simulations are shown that were conducted by al wahaibi et al 2005 with a commercial reservoir simulator these visualisations use a rainbow colour scheme as in the original article because we did not have access to the underpinning data while this makes a direct comparison difficult a number of first order differences are clear there is a significant mismatch between the physical experiment and the simulation not only in terms of the reduced gas migration speed in the inclined layers but there are gas incursions into the bottom set not seen in the experiments and the saturation fronts are smeared in the simulation and lack the channelling by the material interfaces this comparison highlights that the dfefvm flow solver is capable of simulating saturation distributions that closely match multi media physical experiments both qualitatively and quantitatively this physical realism exceeds that which can be obtained with the reservoir simulator that is most commonly used in upscaling studies especially with regard to the resolution of material interfaces the analysis herein confirms similar findings made in an earlier study with a heuristic model youssef et al 2021 4 1 laminated quartz sandstone model core2d 4 1 1 upscaled absolute permeability tensor the equivalent permeability tensor of model core2d was determined with the standard steady state procedure for single phase simulation section 2 2 for flow in the horizontal direction the preferred flow paths are in layers 0 and 9 where the permeability is high fig 12 the average velocity m s and pressure gradient pa m computed in this direction are u x x 9 21367 1 0 5 u y x 4 2531 1 0 7 m s and p x x 19753 8 p x y 22 1302 1 0 7 pa for flow in the vertical direction the velocity field is rather uniform the average velocity and pressure gradient computed in this direction are u y x 8 0199 1 0 8 u y y 2 5815 1 0 5 m s and p y x 60 7704 p y y 7142 72 pa the equivalent permeability computed by numeric simulation is k 4 7027 0 0259 0 0259 3 6144 1 0 12 m 2 the two eigenvalues or this tensor are λ 1 4 7033 1 0 12 m 2 and λ 2 3 6138 1 0 12 m 2 the longitudinal and latitudinal components of the equivalent permeability tensor for this layered porous medium can be estimated from dagan 1985 bear 1993 k x x r e f i 1 n k i t i i 1 n t i 4 7034 1 0 12 m 2 k y y r e f i 1 n t i i 1 n t i k i 3 6055 1 0 12 m 2 k x y r e f k y x r e f 0 m 2 where k i and t i are layer permeability and thickness respectively it can be seen that the equivalent permeability computed by the two methods are almost identical this good match is due to the uniform thickness and small inclination of the laminations 4 1 2 equivalent relative permeability following the procedure section 2 2 forward transport simulations were conducted to determine the equivalent relative permeability of the model in all runs gravity was enabled but had little effect on the saturation distribution due to the small size of the model in the low rate scenario initially uniform saturation values change considerably within the first minute fig 13 saturation jumps evolve at the material interfaces and the rock layers become visible in the saturation pattern due to the high permeability of the sample a steady state saturation pattern is reached after 180 min fig 14 already after the first hour the co 2 saturation distribution barely changes however the equilibration process is asymptotic and it takes two more hours until the termination criterion for the simulation is met running the simulation even longer there is a very gradual minor magnification of the saturation differences between the layers experimentation with different random initial saturation distributions and correlation lengths to determine whether the obtained pseudo steady state saturation depends on initial saturation did not identify such a dependence this is corroborated by the findings summarised in berg and ott 2012 fig 15 illustrates the saturation distributions obtained for different mean s n values at the low flow rate the obtained patterns reflects the laminated structure of the sandstone there is a slight asymmetry with elevated co 2 saturation values upstream of the layers with a high capillary entry pressure this asymmetry within individual layers marks the flow direction and scales in magnitude with the flow rate as will be shown further below the equivalent relative permeability computed from these saturation patterns is aligned with the model so that the tensor has a diagonal form as shown in fig 18 when s w is below 0 1 the equivalent curve k r n y y that represents the tensor s eigenvalue in the vertical direction is identical to that of all layers the non wetting phase is continuous across the entire model there is no capillary locking at any saturation state essentially this ensemble curve is similar to that of the capillary limit model when s w increases however k r n y y is shifted below the lower bounding curve as shown in fig 15 co 2 eventually accumulates upstream of the high entry pressure layers although high co 2 saturations imply greater total mobility due to its low viscosity capillary trapping halts the flow in the vertical direction and co 2 mobility drops to zero the higher s w the stronger the capillary trapping effect when it occurs at s w 0 6 the co 2 distribution is discontinuous at several material interfaces this capillary trapping implies a high macroscopic residual saturation of co 2 as long as gravitational or viscous forces are small given the frequently observed inverse correlation between permeability and entry pressure the mobility of co 2 in core2d depends on the permeability distribution the higher the permeability the lower the entry pressure the low viscosity of co 2 locally pushes total mobility to very high values creating preferential paths in the model aligned with the horizontal direction as a result while the equivalent vertical relative permeability reduces during saturation build up which is enhanced by gravitational segregation the horizontal one increases correspondingly fig 18 for this low rate setup the non wetting phase relative permeability curves computed by our new method and the capillary limit approximation are in good agreement over the whole saturation range notwithstanding a small deviation emerges at high water saturations when capillary trapping dominates the system behaviour in the high flow rate scenario the model shows a different co 2 distribution pattern figs 16 and 17 the strong pressure gradient maintains flow across the laminae at all saturations although some capillary hold up is visible fluid pressure remains continuous no capillary end effects can be observed and saturation varies freely along the periodic top and bottom boundaries the ensemble relative permeability curves stay within the bounds determined by the relative permeability curves of layers 3 and 5 fig 19 unlike the low flow rate scenario the results obtained by the two methods steady state vl and our method are closely matched over the whole saturation range 4 1 3 equivalent capillary pressure we used a volume weighted averaging method to compute capillary pressure curves in the domain for both cl and vl conditions the capillary pressure values at the finite element nodes are computed from the phase distributions fig 20 the cl and vl curves share the same entry pressure but a discrepancy becomes visible as the water saturation diminishes in the cl approximation most of the co 2 stays in the low capillary pressure layers resulting in the blue curve by contrast in the vl approximation co 2 is distributed throughout the domain resulting in a higher average capillary pressure red curve when the saturation of co 2 is higher both curves match suggesting that the distribution of co 2 no longer significantly impacts overall capillary pressure within the domain in the simulations with core2d we did not notice capillary pressure hysteresis 4 1 4 simulation speed the execution time for the cl and vl approximations is always nearly the same and many orders of magnitude faster than our flow based method table 4 the dfefvm solver also requires more execution time in the high than in the low rate scenario this is because it uses an impes scheme for time marching subject to the courant fredrich levy cfl condition which is more stringent for flow velocities although our flow solver is slower than the cl or vl calculations the advantage is that its application is not restricted to the cl and vl force balance end member cases and it also permits the consideration of gravitational forces 4 2 intertidal layered sandstone model bedset for an initial total saturation of co 2 of 0 4 and without gravity the co 2 saturation in the model stabilises after two days fig 21a subsequent minor saturation redistribution by capillary spreading takes many days due to the much larger model size due to the pronounced capillary pressure contrasts between the different facies types of the sandstone co 2 saturation builds up ahead of the muddy intervals again the effect of the material interfaces is captured well by the flow solver co 2 accumulates in the uppermost parts of the clean sandstone layers forming very thin rims from there it leaks downstream at preferential locations yellow haloes fig 19 coinciding with minor kinks in these layers the co 2 buildup in the clean sandstone is more pronounced when gravity is enabled similar to model core2d the trapped co 2 concentrates in the high permeability layers where it promotes a high layer parallel co 2 mobility the thin layers of co 2 therefore become preferential co 2 pathways when a horizontal pressure gradient exists it follows that the relative permeability of the non wetting phase is amplified fig 22a the relative permeability curve of water is not too different for the gravity free case probably because the highly permeable clean sand is less volumetrically important than the more permeable layers in model core2d in model bedset the muddy sands account for approximately 78 of the model area accommodating most of the co 2 the buoyancy force accelerates the phase redistribution process during vertical flow co 2 breakthrough occurs only in the arched portions of the material interfaces where the co 2 accumulations are the thickest the rest of the material interfaces are blocked by capillary sealing lowering the relative permeability of both phases fig 22b these results for vertical flow on the metre scale indicate that the barrier effect of facies interfaces is strong fig 21 again co 2 accumulation promotes a high horizontal total mobility amplifying the relative permeability of the non wetting phase fig 22a 5 discussion the forward simulation setup described herein differs from the uniform inflow constant fractional flow setup that is typically applied in numeric and physical experiments where wetting and non wetting phases are injected into the sample at a constant phase ratio blunt 2017 in physical experiments porous plates are used to achieve such conditions the termination criterion indicating when internal force balance equilibrium is obtained in this common setup is taken as the time when the inlet bulk fractional flow matches that at the outlet at this point in time the relative permeability is calculated however as discussed in the introduction these boundary conditions are unrealistic for heterogeneous rocks and this setup is prone to capillary end effects that can distort the saturation distribution in the sample or model for homogeneous rocks capillary end effects can be avoided by matching the capillary pressure plateau of the porous plate to that of the rock this is not always possible and impossible for heterogeneous rocks and rock composites because capillary pressure curves vary across inlet and outlet the advantages of a similar direct numeric simulation procedure based on unsteady flow in a dynamic network model including the use of periodic boundary conditions in the flow direction are demonstrated by gjennestad et al 2020 the use of periodic boundary conditions removes the artificial uniformity of inlet fractional flows and the capillary end effect which have long been a concern and blamed for what was perceived at the time as an apparent rate dependency e g osoba et al 1951 thanks to the application of periodic boundary conditions to the saturation transport equation we can exclude this possibility the outflux from truncated finite volumes at the downstream boundary becomes the influx into the other half of these fvs located at the inlet boundary representing the same petrotype thus the fluid phases can be recirculated through the model while the total phase volumes remain unchanged as compared with the fractional flow approach it is advantageous also that the simulations start with fully satiated conditions i e the phases are interconnected across the sample arguably this makes the results more reproducible simulating merely the redistribution of phases within the model for an initial saturation distribution close to the final one also accelerates convergence especially for highly heterogeneous systems where the simulation of the passage of the saturation front through the model would take a long time compared to steady state upscaling of heterogeneous porous media which rests on the assumption that the saturation distribution is controlled by capillary or viscous forces only the presented workflow allows consideration of complex saturation distributions that arise from the combined effects of viscous gravity and capillary forces relaxing the cl and vl assumptions comes at the extra cost of flow simulation yet our new approach reduces computational cost because only the modification of an initial saturation distribution is required as opposed to a full forward simulation this is advantageous also because it overcomes problematic issues such as finite scale effects that are well known from core flooding experiments osoba et al 1951 li and sheng 2016 while our approach is flow based it shows a good agreement with the capillary limit approach for capillary dominated flow and with the viscous limit approach for viscous dominated flows both methods capture the effect of material interfaces but only the flow based method addresses the asymmetry of saturation distributions at intermediate force balances as demonstrated both methods can be combined using a cl saturation distribution as an initial guess for the flow based upscaling as shown this benefits computation efficiency for conditions between the cl and vl that can only be explored with a flow based method the models presented here do not feature representative elementary volumes revs of the investigated heterogeneous porous media so there is no separation of scale between model size and that of the incorporated laminations and bedforms for this reason one can rightly argue that they are not suitable for upscaling i e the equivalent properties derived are not effective medium properties analysing rev scale three dimensional models is the subject of a ongoing separate study youssef et al 2022 the equilibration distance that is often estimated by back of the envelope calculations to predetermine the size of the models for the numeric experiments in actuality is heterogeneity flow rate and flow direction dependent any coarsening instabilities that will arise during the unstable displacement of brine by co 2 are not considered by steady state upscaling setups berg and ott 2012 these limitations may also be overcome and the complexity seen may be handled by the new analysis approach because of its greater flexibility that allows the automation of sensitivity analysis studies on large samples whereas in the lab one individual core flooding experiment at a single flow rate of interest would take months to complete honarpour et al 1995 seyyedi et al 2022 since equivalent relative permeability is derived from the spatial saturation distribution in the model the accuracy of the measurement of this parameter depends on the physical realism of the multiphase flow simulation if the solver fails to capture the different possible states of capillary discontinuities this will diminish or eliminate the sensitivity to small scale heterogeneity and flow regime the simulation lab experiment study of al wahaibi and co workers 2005 highlights that standard reservoir simulators are not necessarily suited for core scale numeric simulation and can fail to reproduce the saturation distributions seen in physical experiments fig 11 an explanation for this mismatch may include 1 the common global pressure treatment of capillary pressure in the governing equations that relies on capillary pressure saturation equilibrium aziz and settari 1979 li et al 2003 and 2 the representation of material interfaces that lacks the extra pressure degree of freedom needed to model the scenario where total pressure evolves independently on either side of a transient capillary membrane seal watts 1987 tran et al 2020 s dfefvm scheme used here overcomes these deficiencies and their nonlinear iterative interface coupling scheme can even resolve the transient valve like behaviour seen in some experiments benzing et al 1996 finally it is worth noting that it may be challenging to find sample geometries that have the symmetry necessary to apply periodic boundary conditions e g durlofsky 2005 this was frequently possible for the heterogeneous core samples that this method has been developed for but when this condition is not satisfied the medium can be made periodic using one of two methods translation whitaker 1986 or symmetry guibert et al 2016 6 conclusions this paper presents a new method for the computation of equivalent relative permeability in heterogeneous porous media upscaling is performed numerically using a multiphase flow solver based on a hybrid finite element finite volume discretisation with embedded discontinuities this flow solver underpins a workflow for the generation of steady state saturation distributions evolved from prescribed initial phase distributions matching a given bulk saturation of interest the steady state saturation distributions ensue from fluid recirculation through the model for a prescribed balance of viscous gravitational and capillary forces this recirculation is facilitated by periodic boundary conditions when the saturation distribution reaches its pseudo steady state the equivalent relative permeability is determined from finite element volume weighted average phase velocities pressure gradients and viscosities as well as the equivalent absolute permeability tensor repeating this process for different saturation values the relative permeability curves that typify the flow regime of interest are constructed the ability of the flow solver to produce realistic saturation distributions is tested by simulating a well documented hele shaw cell experiment with a model that contains discrete material interfaces the upscaling procedure is illustrated for two models at different length scales the first is a laminated quartz sandstone from the precipice sandstone in the surat basin in queensland a potential co 2 storage site and the second is an outcrop analogue model from argentina results obtained for these models indicate a flow rate and direction dependent relative permeability and no flow or even intermittent episodic flow behaviour at some conditions key observations made are the obtained equivalent flow properties capture

37,based on the classical one dimensional particle transport model a three dimensional particle transport model with a dual deposition mode considering sieving and adsorption effects was established through laplace and fourier transforms general solutions for particle transport in saturated semi infinite porous media under one dimensional seepage and three dimensional dispersion conditions were derived according to the basic solution in the case of a point source injection on the surface of a semi infinite body the analytical expression in the case of a circular surface source injection was obtained by the integration method the analytical solution is verified using two well established numerical simulation solvers the influence of parameters such as the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient sieving coefficient adsorption coefficient and desorption coefficient on the mechanism of the particle transport process was analyzed under the conditions of constant concentration and circulating concentration injection of the circular surface source the results showed that the hydrodynamic dispersion effect accelerated the transport of particles shortened the breakthrough time and increased the peak concentration moreover a larger sieving coefficient and particle adsorption coefficient meant a smaller particle release coefficient and more particles deposited on the solid matrix

laplace transform variable with respect to spatial coordinate x 1 introduction particle transport in water flowing through porous media is of interest in many fields such as geosciences and various particle separation techniques such as filtration membrane processes and chromatography one of the most convenient ways to examine particle transport and fate is through tracer studies kretzschmar et al 1997 grolimund et al 1998 massei et al 2002 this method can obtain rich information about porous media gitis et al 2002 2010 with little effort to prepare particles experiments typically introduce a spike pulse of the tracer at the entrance and collect the probe at outlet kretzschmar et al 1997 grolimund et al 1998 massei et al 2002 therefore the exit tracer concentration plays an important role in understanding and characterizing the processes taking place inside the medium this concentration is described as a function of time to provide a residence time distribution or breakthrough curve londergan et al 2001 boulding et al 2016 the tracer or particle concentration at the outlet depends on processes such as convection dispersion reactions and accumulation on the theoretical side it is described by the convection diffusion diffusion equation and its extensions which also include the reaction term this equation has been studied extensively in the past both in general terms polyanin et al 2001 and in specific applications related to chemical and environmental engineering kretzschmar et al 1997 grolimund et al 1998 leij et al 1998 while many field problems require comprehensive numerical models that simulate transient fluid flow and particle transport many transport problems can be well solved using simplified one or multi dimensional analytical models according to several studies javandel et al 1984 leij et al 1991 bauer et al 2001 vanderborght et al 2005 guerrero et al 2009 analytical models can be used to provide initial or approximate studies of alternative pollution scenarios conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of various parameters or processes on the effects of contaminant transport extrapolate results at large temporal and spatial scales where numerical solutions become impractical and are used as sieving models and estimate transport parameters from laboratory or well defined field experiments for more complex unsolvable analytical solutions the transport process can provide benchmark solutions and validate a more comprehensive numerical solution of the governing transport equations the classical particle transport model assumes that the deposition of suspended particles in porous media is caused by adsorption sakthivadive et al 1970 found that when the ratio of the size of the suspended particles to the particle size of the porous medium was greater than 0 05 there was a significant sieving effect that is the particle size of the suspended particles was larger than the pore size of the porous medium forming a sieving sediment bradford et al 2004 showed that when the ratio of the median size of the suspended particles to the particle size of the porous medium was greater than the low particle size ratio of 0 005 the sieving effect still played an important role therefore when the particle size ratio is low the prediction results considering both particle sieving and adsorption are closer to the experimental results one way to deal with the additional deposition mechanism due to sieving is to assume the existence of a dual deposition pattern sieving deposition and adsorption deposition approaches that use dual modes of deposition to predict particle transport are not new in terms of numerical simulation bradford et al 2006 have developed a two species model whereby each species had its own set of rate values to account for mono dispersed and aggregated species behaviors bradford et al 2009 have proposed a dual permeability model to account for different rates of transport in fast and slow velocity regions of the pore space in terms of analytical models basha 2010 assumed that there are two sites for particle deposition in porous media reversible and irreversible and a dual mode of irreversible deposition and obtained a bimodal particle transport model using the green s function method it can more accurately fit the observed particle transport and deposition behavior katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2019 obtained a one dimensional analytical solution of particle transport in a dual deposition mode by the laplace transform method which better fitted the existing experimental data because the solution to the problem becomes complicated after considering double deposition these analytical models are all carried out in one dimensional conditions which do not conform to the spatial characteristics of particle transport in this paper the deposition kinetics equation under a dual deposition mode was used to modify the classical model of particle transport by considering the re release of attached particles and the sieving effect of large particles for the three dimensional particle transport model the general solution of the three dimensional particle transport model was obtained through laplace and fourier transforms and their inverse transforms section 2 then the analytical expressions of particle transport in semi infinite space under the injection conditions of a point source and a circular surface source were obtained section 3 and the analytical solution is verified using two well established numerical simulation solvers section 4 finally based on the derived analytical solutions the influence of parameters such as the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient sieving coefficient adsorption coefficient and release coefficient on the mechanism of the particle transport process under the conditions of constant concentration and circulating concentration injection of a circular surface source was analyzed in detail section 5 to the best of our knowledge there are no analytical solutions in the literature for the 3d transport of particles in porous media in a dual deposition mode analytical models such as these may be useful for evaluating conventional numerical models 2 three dimensional governing equation and general solution of particle transport 2 1 establishment of governing equations considering convection three dimensional hydrodynamic dispersion and particle deposition effects in a saturated uniform flow field the mass balance equation for the transport of suspended particles in the liquid phase of porous media is 1 c t v c x d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 d z 2 c z 2 1 n c t where c is the concentration of suspended solids in the liquid phase and the dimension is ml 3 t is time and the dimension is t v is the average flow rate of pore fluid and the dimension is lt 1 x is the space parallel to the flow direction coordinates and the dimension is l y and z are the spatial coordinates perpendicular to the flow direction and the dimension is l dx dy and dz are the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients in the directions of x y and z respectively and the dimension is l2t 1 n is the porosity and the dimension is 1 and c is the total mass of the particles deposited in the unit volume and the dimension is ml 3 both c and c are functions of variables t x y and z there are two main mechanisms affecting particle deposition in porous media namely the sieving effect of large particles and the adsorption effect of small particles sakthivadivel et al 1970 tu et al 2022 fig 1 presents a schematic representation of the deposition of two types of particles the total mass of particles deposited in a unit volumec the sieving deposition term c 1 and the adsorption deposition term c 2 are related as follows 2 c c 1 c 2 in which the sieving deposition term c 1 is considered irreversible while the adsorption deposition term c 2 is reversible c 1 and c 2 exist a well established adsorption desorption kinetics bradford et al 2003 2004 since sieve deposition of colloids was assumed a priori to be insignificant little attention was paid to the range of colloid and porous media parameters that might limit the applicability of the adhesion model in our study the following simple and flexible form is used to explain sieve deposition 3 1 n c 1 t x y z t k s t r c t x y z where kstr is the sieving coefficient and the dimension is t 1 and is exponentially related to the particle size ratio bradford et al 2003 in the absence of colloid deactivation or degradation the adsorption deposition of colloids adopts the classical colloid attachment theory tufenkji et al 2003 4 1 n c 2 t x y z t k a t c t x y z k d e n c 2 t x y z where kat is the particle adsorption coefficient and the dimension is t 1 and kde is the particle release coefficient and the dimension is t 1 colloid filtration theory is incorporated into the kat term as e g logan et al 1995 k a t 3 1 n v α η 2 d 50 where d 50 is the average particle size of the porous medium α is the particle adsorption efficiency η is the collection efficiency the particle adsorption efficiency α is typically used to account for the influence of solution and solid phase chemistries on the colloid attachment dong 2002 and has also been shown to be dependent on the hydrodynamic conditions tufenkji 2004 it can be treated as an empirical parameter but it may also be theoretically estimated by considering the energy and or torque balance that acts on colloids near the swi bradford et al 2011 the collection efficiency η is related to the mass transfer rate of colloids from the bulk solution to the solid water interface swi it is normally calculated by solving the convection diffusion equation or doing a trajectory analysis under the assumption of a perfect sink boundary condition at the swi elimelech 1994 rajagopalan and tien 1976 the first term on the right side of eq 1 is the convection term which reflects the seepage effect of particle transport the last term on the right side of eq 1 is the particle deposition term which is jointly controlled by the deposition kinetic eqs 2 4 the particle transport model in this paper is composed of eqs 1 4 is jointly established thus taking into account the coupled effects of seepage and particle transport and sedimentation assuming that there are no particles in the porous medium initially and the particles are injected from the surface of the semi infinite space the corresponding initial and boundary conditions can be expressed as 5 c 0 x y z 0 6 c 0 x y z 0 7 c t 0 y z g t y z 8 c t y z 0 9 c t x z 0 10 c t x y 0 the initial condition eqs 5 and 6 indicate that there are neither deposited particles nor suspended particles in the porous medium the boundary condition eq 7 represents the particle injection source in which the injection intensity varies with time on the surface of a semi infinite space boundary conditions 8 10 are ideal cases of semi infinite domains considering that the fine particles may not be able to penetrate the porous medium under an extreme scenario the particle transport model proposed in this paper should have limitations for the particle size referring to zhang et al 2022 and bai et al 2016 the particle size ratio of fine particles to porous media was limited to less than 0 1 when the particle size of fine particles was larger than 100 μm the gravity sedimentation of particles was more obvious tu et al 2022 only convection and hydrodynamic dispersion were considered in this model so when applying this model the particle size of fine particles should be less than 100 μm 2 2 general solution of particle transport first the solution of eq 3 under the initial condition 5 is obtained by laplace transform as 11 c 1 t x y z k s t r n 0 t c τ x y z d τ similarly the solution of eq 4 can be obtained as 12 c 2 t x y z k a t n 0 t c τ x y z exp k d e t τ d τ deriving eqs 11 and 12 for t and inserting it into eq 1 the expression for the concentration of suspended solids in the liquid phase is 13 c t ν c x d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 d z 2 c z 2 k a t k s t r c k a t k d e 0 t c τ

concentration changes with time t are continuously injected at t 0 then the particle transport process inside the porous medium is equivalent to the spatial superposition of the particle transport process of point source injections with an infinite number of strengths g t dydz therefore the concentration of particles in the porous medium can be obtained by integrating eq 19 in the spatial

solution the analytical solution eq 24 developed in this study was compared with two well established software packages first the analytical solution of the single deposition mode a 5 cm tp 100 min kstr 0min 1 under the condition of constant concentration injection of a circular area source on the surface of a semi infinite space is compared with the calculation results of the pde directly solved by the stanmod software package van genuchten et al 2012 as shown in fig 2 a then the analytical solution of the dual deposition mode a 5 cm tp 100 min kstr 0 02min 1 under the condition of constant concentration injection of a circular area source on the surface of a semi infinite space is compared with the calculation results of the pde directly solved by the famous comsol multiphysics software package zimmerman 2006 as shown in fig 2 b the model parameters used for the two comparisons are shown in table 1 it can be seen from fig 6 that the analytical and numerical solutions obtain the same concentration distribution which shows that the analytical solution obtained in this paper is reliable 4 3 application to experimental data 4 3 1 constant concentration injection in this section eqs 26 and 27 are used to analyze the experiments of syngouna 2013 and compare those results with the analytical solution of particle transport in the single deposition mode kstr 0 to test the applicability of the analytical solution of particle transport in the dual deposition mode syngouna 2013 carried out transport experiments using two types of clay particles kaolinite kga 1b and montmorillonite stx 1b at two flow rates v 1 21 and 0 74 cm min in a horizontal column packed with glass beads the column diameter d was 2 5 cm the length l was 30 cm the porosity n was 0 42 and other related parameters are shown in table 2 the analysis of the experimental data was carried out by pest parameter estimation and an automatic calibration suite of programs the pest suite is a comprehensive software package developed using the gauss marquardt levenberg algorithm that is independent of model parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis it has the advantages of the inverse hessian method and the steepest descent method like the steepest descent method the optimal parameter results can be obtained with fewer model runs skahill et al 2009 the parameter calibration using the pest program was divided into three steps the first step was to determine the objective function in this paper a single objective was used for parameter optimization and the optimization objective was to minimize the sum of the squares of the difference between the theoretical effluent concentration of suspended solids and the measured effluent concentration the objective function equation is 30 min f i 1 j c m o d j c o b s j 2 where f is the objective function i is the period number j is the total number of periods cmod j is the theoretical effluent concentration of suspended matter in the i th period and cobs j is the measured effluent concentration of the suspended matter in the i th period the second step was to select the parameter range and select a reasonable range for the parameters to be calibrated the parameters to be calibrated are dx kstr kat and kde the third step was to input the measured effluent concentration data of the suspended solids and iteratively solve the model to output the calibrated parameter results and the theoretical effluent concentration of the suspended solids the breakthrough curve of the experimental data and the calculated results of the analytical solution of particle transport in the single and double deposition modes are shown in fig 3 x l 30 cm and the relevant parameters are shown in table 2 for the two flow rate cases considered in syngouna 2013 the analytical solution of the dual deposition mode successfully fitted the breakthrough curves x l 30 cm of kga 1b and stx 1b for the single deposition mode under the same conditions the effect of the analytic solution on this set of experimental data was not ideal indicating that the analytical solution of particle transport is better in the dual deposition mode 4 3 2 instantaneous injection in this section bai s 2016 experiment was analyzed by the instantaneous injection particle transport analytical eq 29 and compared with the particle transport analytical solution in the single deposition mode kstr 0 to test the performance of the particle transport analytical solution in the dual deposition mode the analysis method of the experimental data was the same as that in section 4 2 bai et al 2016 carried out transport experiments using two sizes of spherical silica particles median diameter d 50 1 02 and 47 μm in quartz sand d 50 2 25 mm at two flow rates v 0 384 and 0 576 cm s the transport test was carried out in a column in which the diameter d was 7 cm the length l was 30 cm and the porosity n was 0 45 the relative concentration was defined as cr cv p m where v p is the pore volume of the column the breakthrough curve of the experimental data and the calculated results of the analytical solution of particle transport in the single and double deposition modes are shown in fig 4 x l 30 cm and the relevant parameters are shown in table 3 it can be seen from fig 4 that the analytical eq 29 successfully simulated the breakthrough curve of particle transport during instantaneous injection and the performance when the particle size was larger d 50 47 μm was better than that of the analytical solution of particle transport in the single layer deposition mode the analysis shows that when the particle size of the suspended matter was 1 02 μm the particle size ratio was much less than 0 005 and the particle deposition was dominated by adsorption when the particle size of the suspended matter was 47 μm the particle size ratio was greater than 0 005 and the sieving effect on particle deposition plays an important role the particle transport model using the dual deposition mode performed better in this scenario 4 3 3 discussion of the application of experimental data due to the large number of fitting parameters dx kstr kat and kde the best fitting parameters obtained in this paper may not be the global optimal solution which leads to the non physical nature of the best fitting parameters to ameliorate this potential limitation links between fitted parameters can be established since the release coefficient kde is negligible compared with the deposition coefficient kat and is mainly related to the later stage of the migration process it can be assumed that kde 0 1kat bekhit et al 2009 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 to reduce the number of fitting parameters in addition when the selection range of fitting parameters is changed other well fitting parameter sets may be obtained in order to obtain the best fitting parameters of physics the values of the deposition coefficient kat logan et al 1995 bradford and torkzaban 2015 and the sieving coefficient kstr bradford et al 2003 can be estimated by the method in the published literature and the selection range of fitting parameters can be further narrowed 5 particle transport law during circular surface source injection in this section the three dimensional transport law of particles in porous media was studied through the analytical solution of particle transport in the dual deposition mode eq 24 during circular surface source injection two typical particle injection methods constant concentration injection and cyclic injection were selected for analysis 5 1 example calculation parameters relevant literature formulated calculation parameters sharma et al 2008 ziskind et al 2011 guerrero et al 2013 radial hydrodynamic

concentration injection fig 5 shows the evolution of the suspended particle concentration when there is a constant particle source injection on the surface of a semi infinite porous material tp 200 min a 5 cm introducing the dimensionless concentration c c 0 it can be seen from fig 5 that c c 0 gradually changes with time in the depth direction vertical and the horizontal direction due to the seepage effect in the depth direction the transport speed of particles in the depth direction was significantly faster than that in the horizontal direction when the time was increased e g tp 160 min the particle transport process gradually stabilized and the spatial distribution of the particle concentration remained unchanged fig 6 shows the particle migration process tp 100 min a 5 cm when the concentration is injected at a constant rate it can be seen from fig 6 a that during particle injection t tp the concentration of suspended particles in porous media increases rapidly with time and tends to be stable after the injection of particles stopped t tp the concentration of particle matter reached the peak and then decreased rapidly with the increase of depth the injected particles gradually migrate and deposit toward the depth and horizontal direction of the porous medium under the action of convection and dispersion therefore at a certain depth the particle concentration in porous media will gradually increase the greater the depth the longer the time for the particle concentration to reach the peak and the smaller the peak concentration fig 6 b shows the distribution of the particle concentration in the porous medium along the depth when a constant concentration was injected tp 100 min a 5 cm during the particle injection period i e t 20 min 40 min 80 min the particle concentration in the porous medium increased with time and decreased with depth tending to zero after the particle injection stopped i e t 120 min 140 min 180 min the particle concentration on the surface of the porous medium decreased rapidly the concentration peak decreased with time and the depth at which the peak concentration was located increased with time fig 7 shows the results of the deposition amount changing with time during particle transportation tp 100 min a 5 cm r 0 cm it can be seen from fig 7 that within the time range of particle injection tp 100 min the irreversible sieve deposition c 1 and reversible adsorption deposition c 2 both increase with time and decrease with depth stop after injecting particles tp 100 min the irreversible sieve deposition amount c 1 gradually increased and tended to be stable while the reversible adsorption deposition amount c 2 first increased and then decreased which indicated that there was a particle release effect in the adsorption deposition to further study the sensitivity of the particle transport model to each model parameter under a constant concentration injection the suspended solids breakthrough curves were calculated when the values of parameters dx kstr kat and kde were varied x 10 cm tp 100 min the sensitivity results of the parameters are shown in fig 8 it can be seen from fig 8 that there was a peak in the breakthrough curve of the suspended solids and the peak particle concentration increased with an increase of the parameters dx and kde and decreased with an increase of kstr and kat the analysis shows that the larger the value of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient dx the more significant the particle dispersion effect the faster the breakthrough time and the smaller the concentration after stopping the injection t tp in addition the larger the values of kstr and kat the more particles were deposited on the solid matrix and thus the smaller the peak concentration of particles in the liquid phase finally the larger the kde value the more the deposited particles were detached from the solid matrix resulting in a larger peak concentration in the liquid phase 5 3 particle transport law during injection of a circulating concentration pollution processes in porous media caused by periodically released or discharged circulating concentrations of pollutants and their treatment processes are a typical class of problems in the chemical industry petroleum industry and pharmaceutical industry bai et al 2016 for the case of a cyclic concentration injection consider the harmonic variation of particle injection intensity with time 31 g τ c 0 1 a sin 2 π t t where a is the amplitude of the simple harmonic motion and t is the period of the simple harmonic motion fig 9 shows the spatial particle concentration evolution a 1 t 20 min a 5 cm when simple harmonic vibrations were used to inject into the surface of the semi infinite porous material it can be seen from fig 9 that the depth and width directions gradually changed with time due to the cyclic variation of the injected particle concentration there was a local peak in the particle concentration in the porous medium when the time was extended e g tp 160 min the particle transport process was gradually stabilized and the spatial distribution of the particle concentration remained unchanged fig 10 shows the particle transport process a 1 t 20 min a 5 cm when the particles were injected using a simple harmonic vibration it can be seen from fig 10 a that the particle concentration in the porous medium fluctuated and rose as time increased and reached a quasi steady state with an increase in the number of cycles consistent with the fluctuation of the particle injection source as the depth increased x 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm the amplitude of the particle concentration fluctuations decreased fig 10 b shows the distribution of the particle concentration in the porous medium along the depth under harmonic injection of the particle source a 1 t 20 min a 5 cm the particle concentration generally showed a downward trend with an increase in depth but there was a local peak in the depth range of 5 10 cm which was caused by the fluctuation of the particle injection intensity over time t 120 min 140 min 180 min the distribution of the particle concentration gradually stabilized which is also reflected in fig 9 fig 11 reflects the effect of harmonic motion parameters on the particle transport process it can be seen from fig 11 a that with an increase of the harmonic amplitude a the fluctuation amplitude of the suspended solids concentration in the porous medium also increased and this trend was more obvious at the lower depth x 10 cm it should be noted that the cycle frequency in industry may take a large range of values so we specifically studied the effect of the cycle frequency of particle concentration on particle migration in porous media considering that our study time is 200 min we choosed three cycles of 20 min 40 min and 60 min it can be seen from fig 11 b that with the increase of the harmonic vibration period t the amplitude and period of the fluctuation of the suspended matter concentration in the porous medium increased and the depth range of its influence also increased to further study the sensitivity of the particle transport model to various model parameters during the injection of a circulating concentration the suspended solids breakthrough curves were calculated when the values of parameters dx kstr kat and kde were varied x 10 cm a 1 t 20 min the results of the sensitivity calculations of the parameters are shown in fig 12 it can be seen from fig 12 that the model in the early stage of the breakthrough curve t 100 min is in good agreement with fig 8 constant concentration injection tp 100 min the relative concentration increased with increasing dx values and decreased with increasing kstr and kat values in addition it can be seen from fig 12 a that as the parameter dx decreases the amplitude of the fluctuation of the breakthrough curve decreases significantly and the phase of the fluctuation lags while in fig 12 b c and d changing the values of kstr kat kde and other parameters do not affect the amplitude and phase of the fluctuation of the breakthrough curve this indicates that the particle transport process is more sensitive to the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient parameter during the injection of a circulating concentration 6 conclusions the following findings were revealed 1 in this study a three dimensional particle transport model in dual deposition mode considering the sieving effect and adsorption effect was established using laplace and fourier transforms and their transform inversions the model was derived under the conditions of one dimensional seepage and three dimensional dispersion analytical expressions for the spatiotemporal distribution of particle concentration during point source injection and surface source injection were given and the analytical solution is verified using two well established numerical simulation solvers 2 in the case of a constant concentration injection of a circular surface source during particle injection the particle concentration in the porous medium increased with time decreased with depth and tended to zero after the injection of particles was stopped the particle concentration in the porous medium decreased with time there was a concentration peak at a particular depth and the depth at which the concentration peak was located increased with time 3 in the case of a circular surface source simple harmonic dynamic concentration injection the particle concentration in the porous medium fluctuated cyclically with time and reached a quasi steady state consistent with the fluctuation of the particle injection source with an increase in the number of cycles the fluctuation range increased with an increase in the fluctuation range and period of the injection source and decreased with an increase in the depth 4 the analysis of the influence mechanism of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient and deposition parameters in the case of surface source injection showed that the hydrodynamic dispersion effect accelerated the transport of particles which shortened the particle breakthrough time and increased the peak concentration the larger the sieving coefficient kstr and the particle adsorption coefficient kat the smaller the kde particle release coefficient the more particles deposited on the solid matrix and the smaller the peak concentration of suspended particles future studies should consider developing analytical solutions for particle transport in porous media that consider double

37,based on the classical one dimensional particle transport model a three dimensional particle transport model with a dual deposition mode considering sieving and adsorption effects was established through laplace and fourier transforms general solutions for particle transport in saturated semi infinite porous media under one dimensional seepage and three dimensional dispersion conditions were derived according to the basic solution in the case of a point source injection on the surface of a semi infinite body the analytical expression in the case of a circular surface source injection was obtained by the integration method the analytical solution is verified using two well established numerical simulation solvers the influence of parameters such as the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient sieving coefficient adsorption coefficient and desorption coefficient on the mechanism of the particle transport process was analyzed under the conditions of constant concentration and circulating concentration injection of the circular surface source the results showed that the hydrodynamic dispersion effect accelerated the transport of particles shortened the breakthrough time and increased the peak concentration moreover a larger sieving coefficient and particle adsorption coefficient meant a smaller particle release coefficient and more particles deposited on the solid matrix

laplace transform variable with respect to spatial coordinate x 1 introduction particle transport in water flowing through porous media is of interest in many fields such as geosciences and various particle separation techniques such as filtration membrane processes and chromatography one of the most convenient ways to examine particle transport and fate is through tracer studies kretzschmar et al 1997 grolimund et al 1998 massei et al 2002 this method can obtain rich information about porous media gitis et al 2002 2010 with little effort to prepare particles experiments typically introduce a spike pulse of the tracer at the entrance and collect the probe at outlet kretzschmar et al 1997 grolimund et al 1998 massei et al 2002 therefore the exit tracer concentration plays an important role in understanding and characterizing the processes taking place inside the medium this concentration is described as a function of time to provide a residence time distribution or breakthrough curve londergan et al 2001 boulding et al 2016 the tracer or particle concentration at the outlet depends on processes such as convection dispersion reactions and accumulation on the theoretical side it is described by the convection diffusion diffusion equation and its extensions which also include the reaction term this equation has been studied extensively in the past both in general terms polyanin et al 2001 and in specific applications related to chemical and environmental engineering kretzschmar et al 1997 grolimund et al 1998 leij et al 1998 while many field problems require comprehensive numerical models that simulate transient fluid flow and particle transport many transport problems can be well solved using simplified one or multi dimensional analytical models according to several studies javandel et al 1984 leij et al 1991 bauer et al 2001 vanderborght et al 2005 guerrero et al 2009 analytical models can be used to provide initial or approximate studies of alternative pollution scenarios conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of various parameters or processes on the effects of contaminant transport extrapolate results at large temporal and spatial scales where numerical solutions become impractical and are used as sieving models and estimate transport parameters from laboratory or well defined field experiments for more complex unsolvable analytical solutions the transport process can provide benchmark solutions and validate a more comprehensive numerical solution of the governing transport equations the classical particle transport model assumes that the deposition of suspended particles in porous media is caused by adsorption sakthivadive et al 1970 found that when the ratio of the size of the suspended particles to the particle size of the porous medium was greater than 0 05 there was a significant sieving effect that is the particle size of the suspended particles was larger than the pore size of the porous medium forming a sieving sediment bradford et al 2004 showed that when the ratio of the median size of the suspended particles to the particle size of the porous medium was greater than the low particle size ratio of 0 005 the sieving effect still played an important role therefore when the particle size ratio is low the prediction results considering both particle sieving and adsorption are closer to the experimental results one way to deal with the additional deposition mechanism due to sieving is to assume the existence of a dual deposition pattern sieving deposition and adsorption deposition approaches that use dual modes of deposition to predict particle transport are not new in terms of numerical simulation bradford et al 2006 have developed a two species model whereby each species had its own set of rate values to account for mono dispersed and aggregated species behaviors bradford et al 2009 have proposed a dual permeability model to account for different rates of transport in fast and slow velocity regions of the pore space in terms of analytical models basha 2010 assumed that there are two sites for particle deposition in porous media reversible and irreversible and a dual mode of irreversible deposition and obtained a bimodal particle transport model using the green s function method it can more accurately fit the observed particle transport and deposition behavior katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2019 obtained a one dimensional analytical solution of particle transport in a dual deposition mode by the laplace transform method which better fitted the existing experimental data because the solution to the problem becomes complicated after considering double deposition these analytical models are all carried out in one dimensional conditions which do not conform to the spatial characteristics of particle transport in this paper the deposition kinetics equation under a dual deposition mode was used to modify the classical model of particle transport by considering the re release of attached particles and the sieving effect of large particles for the three dimensional particle transport model the general solution of the three dimensional particle transport model was obtained through laplace and fourier transforms and their inverse transforms section 2 then the analytical expressions of particle transport in semi infinite space under the injection conditions of a point source and a circular surface source were obtained section 3 and the analytical solution is verified using two well established numerical simulation solvers section 4 finally based on the derived analytical solutions the influence of parameters such as the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient sieving coefficient adsorption coefficient and release coefficient on the mechanism of the particle transport process under the conditions of constant concentration and circulating concentration injection of a circular surface source was analyzed in detail section 5 to the best of our knowledge there are no analytical solutions in the literature for the 3d transport of particles in porous media in a dual deposition mode analytical models such as these may be useful for evaluating conventional numerical models 2 three dimensional governing equation and general solution of particle transport 2 1 establishment of governing equations considering convection three dimensional hydrodynamic dispersion and particle deposition effects in a saturated uniform flow field the mass balance equation for the transport of suspended particles in the liquid phase of porous media is 1 c t v c x d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 d z 2 c z 2 1 n c t where c is the concentration of suspended solids in the liquid phase and the dimension is ml 3 t is time and the dimension is t v is the average flow rate of pore fluid and the dimension is lt 1 x is the space parallel to the flow direction coordinates and the dimension is l y and z are the spatial coordinates perpendicular to the flow direction and the dimension is l dx dy and dz are the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients in the directions of x y and z respectively and the dimension is l2t 1 n is the porosity and the dimension is 1 and c is the total mass of the particles deposited in the unit volume and the dimension is ml 3 both c and c are functions of variables t x y and z there are two main mechanisms affecting particle deposition in porous media namely the sieving effect of large particles and the adsorption effect of small particles sakthivadivel et al 1970 tu et al 2022 fig 1 presents a schematic representation of the deposition of two types of particles the total mass of particles deposited in a unit volumec the sieving deposition term c 1 and the adsorption deposition term c 2 are related as follows 2 c c 1 c 2 in which the sieving deposition term c 1 is considered irreversible while the adsorption deposition term c 2 is reversible c 1 and c 2 exist a well established adsorption desorption kinetics bradford et al 2003 2004 since sieve deposition of colloids was assumed a priori to be insignificant little attention was paid to the range of colloid and porous media parameters that might limit the applicability of the adhesion model in our study the following simple and flexible form is used to explain sieve deposition 3 1 n c 1 t x y z t k s t r c t x y z where kstr is the sieving coefficient and the dimension is t 1 and is exponentially related to the particle size ratio bradford et al 2003 in the absence of colloid deactivation or degradation the adsorption deposition of colloids adopts the classical colloid attachment theory tufenkji et al 2003 4 1 n c 2 t x y z t k a t c t x y z k d e n c 2 t x y z where kat is the particle adsorption coefficient and the dimension is t 1 and kde is the particle release coefficient and the dimension is t 1 colloid filtration theory is incorporated into the kat term as e g logan et al 1995 k a t 3 1 n v α η 2 d 50 where d 50 is the average particle size of the porous medium α is the particle adsorption efficiency η is the collection efficiency the particle adsorption efficiency α is typically used to account for the influence of solution and solid phase chemistries on the colloid attachment dong 2002 and has also been shown to be dependent on the hydrodynamic conditions tufenkji 2004 it can be treated as an empirical parameter but it may also be theoretically estimated by considering the energy and or torque balance that acts on colloids near the swi bradford et al 2011 the collection efficiency η is related to the mass transfer rate of colloids from the bulk solution to the solid water interface swi it is normally calculated by solving the convection diffusion equation or doing a trajectory analysis under the assumption of a perfect sink boundary condition at the swi elimelech 1994 rajagopalan and tien 1976 the first term on the right side of eq 1 is the convection term which reflects the seepage effect of particle transport the last term on the right side of eq 1 is the particle deposition term which is jointly controlled by the deposition kinetic eqs 2 4 the particle transport model in this paper is composed of eqs 1 4 is jointly established thus taking into account the coupled effects of seepage and particle transport and sedimentation assuming that there are no particles in the porous medium initially and the particles are injected from the surface of the semi infinite space the corresponding initial and boundary conditions can be expressed as 5 c 0 x y z 0 6 c 0 x y z 0 7 c t 0 y z g t y z 8 c t y z 0 9 c t x z 0 10 c t x y 0 the initial condition eqs 5 and 6 indicate that there are neither deposited particles nor suspended particles in the porous medium the boundary condition eq 7 represents the particle injection source in which the injection intensity varies with time on the surface of a semi infinite space boundary conditions 8 10 are ideal cases of semi infinite domains considering that the fine particles may not be able to penetrate the porous medium under an extreme scenario the particle transport model proposed in this paper should have limitations for the particle size referring to zhang et al 2022 and bai et al 2016 the particle size ratio of fine particles to porous media was limited to less than 0 1 when the particle size of fine particles was larger than 100 μm the gravity sedimentation of particles was more obvious tu et al 2022 only convection and hydrodynamic dispersion were considered in this model so when applying this model the particle size of fine particles should be less than 100 μm 2 2 general solution of particle transport first the solution of eq 3 under the initial condition 5 is obtained by laplace transform as 11 c 1 t x y z k s t r n 0 t c τ x y z d τ similarly the solution of eq 4 can be obtained as 12 c 2 t x y z k a t n 0 t c τ x y z exp k d e t τ d τ deriving eqs 11 and

process of point source injections with an infinite number of strengths g t dydz therefore the concentration of particles in the porous medium can be obtained by integrating eq 19 in the spatial

hessian method and the steepest descent method like the steepest descent method the optimal parameter results can be obtained with fewer model runs skahill et al 2009 the parameter calibration using the pest program was divided into three steps the first step was to determine the objective function in this paper a single objective was used for parameter optimization and the optimization objective was to minimize the sum of the squares of the difference between the theoretical effluent concentration of suspended solids and the measured effluent concentration the objective function equation is 30 min f i 1 j c m o d j c o b s j 2 where f is the objective function i is the period number j is the total number of periods cmod j is the theoretical effluent concentration of suspended matter in the i th period and cobs j is the measured effluent concentration of the suspended matter in the i th period the second step was to select the parameter range and select a reasonable range for the parameters to be calibrated the parameters to be calibrated are dx kstr kat and kde the third step was to input the measured effluent concentration data of the suspended solids and iteratively solve the model to output the calibrated parameter results and the theoretical effluent concentration of the suspended solids the breakthrough curve of the experimental data and the calculated results of the analytical solution of particle transport in the single and double deposition modes are shown in fig 3 x l 30 cm and the relevant parameters are shown in table 2 for the two flow rate cases considered in syngouna 2013 the analytical solution of the dual deposition mode successfully fitted the breakthrough curves x l 30 cm of kga 1b and stx 1b for the single deposition mode under the same conditions the effect of the analytic solution on this set of experimental data was not ideal indicating that the analytical solution of particle transport is better in the dual deposition mode 4 3 2 instantaneous injection in this section bai s 2016 experiment was analyzed by the instantaneous injection particle transport analytical eq 29 and compared with the particle transport analytical solution in the single deposition mode kstr 0 to test the performance of the particle transport analytical solution in the dual deposition mode the analysis method of the experimental data was the same as that in section 4 2 bai et al 2016 carried out transport experiments using two sizes of spherical silica particles median diameter d 50 1 02 and 47 μm in quartz sand d 50 2 25 mm at two flow rates v 0 384 and 0 576 cm s the transport test was carried out in a column in which the diameter d was 7 cm the length l was 30 cm and the porosity n was 0 45 the relative concentration was defined as cr cv p m where v p is the pore volume of the column the breakthrough curve of the experimental data and the calculated results of the analytical solution of particle transport in the single and double deposition modes are shown in fig 4 x l 30 cm and the relevant parameters are shown in table 3 it can be seen from fig 4 that the analytical eq 29 successfully simulated the breakthrough curve of particle transport during instantaneous injection and the performance when the particle size was larger d 50 47 μm was better than that of the analytical solution of particle transport in the single layer deposition mode the analysis shows that when the particle size of the suspended matter was 1 02 μm the particle size ratio was much less than 0 005 and the particle deposition was dominated by adsorption when the particle size of the suspended matter was 47 μm the particle size ratio was greater than 0 005 and the sieving effect on particle deposition plays an important role the particle transport model using the dual deposition mode performed better in this scenario 4 3 3 discussion of the application of experimental data due to the large number of fitting parameters dx kstr kat and kde the best fitting parameters obtained in this paper may not be the global optimal solution which leads to the non physical nature of the best fitting parameters to ameliorate this potential limitation links between fitted parameters can be established since the release coefficient kde is negligible compared with the deposition coefficient kat and is mainly related to the later stage of the migration process it can be assumed that kde 0 1kat bekhit et al 2009 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 to reduce the number of fitting parameters in addition when the selection range of fitting parameters is changed other well fitting parameter sets may be obtained in order to obtain the best fitting parameters of physics the values of the deposition coefficient kat logan et al 1995 bradford and torkzaban 2015 and the sieving coefficient kstr bradford et al 2003 can be estimated by the method in the published literature and the selection range of fitting parameters can be further narrowed 5 particle transport law during circular surface source injection in this section the three dimensional transport law of particles in porous media was studied through the analytical solution of particle transport in the dual deposition mode eq 24 during circular surface source injection two typical particle injection methods constant concentration injection and cyclic injection were selected for analysis 5 1 example calculation parameters relevant literature formulated calculation parameters sharma et al 2008 ziskind et al 2011 guerrero et al 2013 radial hydrodynamic

and particle release coefficient kde 0 001min 1 unless otherwise specified all the examples in this paper used the aforementioned values for calculations 5 2 particle transport law at constant concentration injection fig 5 shows the evolution of the suspended particle concentration when there is a constant particle source injection on the surface of a semi infinite porous material tp 200 min a 5 cm introducing the dimensionless concentration c c 0 it can be seen from fig 5 that c c 0 gradually changes with time in the depth direction vertical and the horizontal direction due to the seepage effect in the depth direction the transport speed of particles in the depth direction was significantly faster than that in the horizontal direction when the time was increased e g tp 160 min the particle transport process gradually stabilized and the spatial distribution of the particle concentration remained unchanged fig 6 shows the particle migration process tp 100 min a 5 cm when the concentration is injected at a constant rate it can be seen from fig 6 a that during particle injection t tp the concentration of suspended particles in porous media increases rapidly with time and tends to be stable after the injection of particles stopped t tp the concentration of particle matter reached the peak and then decreased rapidly with the increase of depth the injected particles gradually migrate and deposit toward the depth and horizontal direction of the porous medium under the action of convection and dispersion therefore at a certain depth the particle concentration in porous media will gradually increase the greater the depth the longer the time for the particle concentration to reach the peak and the smaller the peak concentration fig 6 b shows the distribution of the particle concentration in the porous medium along the depth when a constant concentration was injected tp 100 min a 5 cm during the particle injection period i e t 20 min 40 min 80 min the particle concentration in the porous medium increased with time and decreased with depth tending to zero after the particle injection stopped i e t 120 min 140 min 180 min the particle concentration on the surface of the porous medium decreased rapidly the concentration peak decreased with time and the depth at which the peak concentration was located increased with time fig 7 shows the results of the deposition amount changing with time during particle transportation tp 100 min a 5 cm r 0 cm it can be seen from fig 7 that within the time range of particle injection tp 100 min the irreversible sieve deposition c 1 and reversible adsorption deposition c 2 both increase with time and decrease with depth stop after injecting particles tp 100 min the irreversible sieve deposition amount c 1 gradually increased and tended to be stable while the reversible adsorption deposition amount c 2 first increased and then decreased which indicated that there was a particle release effect in the adsorption deposition to further study the sensitivity of the particle transport model to each model parameter under a constant concentration injection the suspended solids breakthrough curves were calculated when the values of parameters dx kstr kat and kde were varied x 10 cm tp 100 min the sensitivity results of the parameters are shown in fig 8 it can be seen from fig 8 that there was a peak in the breakthrough curve of the suspended solids and the peak particle concentration increased with an increase of the parameters dx and kde and decreased with an increase of kstr and kat the analysis shows that the larger the value of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient dx the more significant the particle dispersion effect the faster the breakthrough time and the smaller the concentration after stopping the injection t tp in addition the larger the values of kstr and kat the more particles were deposited on the solid matrix and thus the smaller the peak concentration of particles in the liquid phase finally the larger the kde value the more the deposited particles were detached from the solid matrix resulting in a larger peak concentration in the liquid phase 5 3 particle transport law during injection of a circulating concentration pollution processes in porous media caused by periodically released or discharged circulating concentrations of pollutants and their treatment processes are a typical class of problems in the chemical industry petroleum industry and pharmaceutical industry bai et al 2016 for the case of a cyclic concentration injection consider the harmonic variation of particle injection intensity with time 31 g τ c 0 1 a sin 2 π t t where a is the amplitude of the simple harmonic motion and t is the period of the simple harmonic motion fig 9 shows the spatial particle concentration evolution a 1 t 20 min a 5 cm when simple harmonic vibrations were used to inject into the surface of the semi infinite porous material it can be seen from fig 9 that the depth and width directions gradually changed with time due to the cyclic variation of the injected particle concentration there was a local peak in the particle concentration in the porous medium when the time was extended e g tp 160 min the particle transport process was gradually stabilized and the spatial distribution of the particle concentration remained unchanged fig 10 shows the particle transport process a 1 t 20 min a 5 cm when the particles were injected using a simple harmonic vibration it can be seen from fig 10 a that the particle concentration in the porous medium fluctuated and rose as time increased and reached a quasi steady state with an increase in the number of cycles consistent with the fluctuation of the particle injection source as the depth increased x 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm the amplitude of the particle concentration fluctuations decreased fig 10 b shows the distribution of the particle concentration in the porous medium along the depth under harmonic injection of the particle source a 1 t 20 min a 5 cm the particle concentration generally showed a downward trend with an increase in depth but there was a local peak in the depth range of 5 10 cm which was caused by the fluctuation of the particle injection intensity over time t 120 min 140 min 180 min the distribution of the particle concentration gradually stabilized which is also reflected in fig 9 fig 11 reflects the effect of harmonic motion parameters on the particle transport process it can be seen from fig 11 a that with an increase of the harmonic amplitude a the fluctuation amplitude of the suspended solids concentration in the porous medium also increased and this trend was more obvious at the lower depth x 10 cm it should be noted that the cycle frequency in industry may take a large range of values so we specifically studied the effect of the cycle frequency of particle concentration on particle migration in porous media considering that our study time is 200 min we choosed three cycles of 20 min 40 min and 60 min it can be seen from fig 11 b that with the increase of the harmonic vibration period t the amplitude and period of the fluctuation of the suspended matter concentration in the porous medium increased and the depth range of its influence also increased to further study the sensitivity of the particle transport model to various model parameters during the injection of a circulating concentration the suspended solids breakthrough curves were calculated when the values of parameters dx kstr kat and kde were varied x 10 cm a 1 t 20 min the results of the sensitivity calculations of the parameters are shown in fig 12 it can be seen from fig 12 that the model in the early stage of the breakthrough curve t 100 min is in good agreement with fig 8 constant concentration injection tp 100 min the relative concentration increased with increasing dx values and decreased with increasing kstr and kat values in addition it can be seen from fig 12 a that as the parameter dx decreases the amplitude of the fluctuation of the breakthrough curve decreases significantly and the phase of the fluctuation lags while in fig 12 b c and d changing the values of kstr kat kde and other parameters do not affect the amplitude and phase of the fluctuation of the breakthrough curve this indicates that the particle transport process is more sensitive to the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient parameter during the injection of a circulating concentration 6 conclusions the following findings were revealed 1 in this study a three dimensional particle transport model in dual deposition mode considering the sieving effect and adsorption effect was established using laplace and fourier transforms and their transform inversions the model was derived under the conditions of one dimensional seepage and three dimensional dispersion analytical expressions for the spatiotemporal distribution of particle concentration during point source injection and surface source injection were given and the analytical solution is verified using two well established numerical simulation solvers 2 in the case of a constant concentration injection of a circular surface source during particle injection the particle concentration in the porous medium increased with time decreased with depth and tended to zero after the injection of particles was stopped the particle concentration in the porous medium decreased with time there was a concentration peak at a particular depth and the depth at which the concentration peak was located increased with time 3 in the case of a circular surface source simple harmonic dynamic concentration injection the particle concentration in the porous medium fluctuated cyclically with time and reached a quasi steady state consistent with the fluctuation of the particle injection source with an increase in the number of cycles the fluctuation range increased with an increase in the fluctuation range and period of the injection source and decreased with an increase in the depth 4 the analysis of the influence mechanism of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient and deposition parameters in the case of surface source injection showed that the hydrodynamic dispersion effect accelerated the transport of particles which shortened the particle breakthrough time and increased the peak concentration the larger the sieving coefficient kstr and the particle adsorption coefficient kat the smaller the kde particle release coefficient the more particles deposited on the solid matrix and the smaller the peak concentration of suspended particles future studies should consider developing analytical solutions for particle transport in porous media that consider double

38,accurate estimation of aquifer properties is of critical importance in representing the interactions between hydraulically connected surface subsurface systems the variability in recession characteristics i e decline rates and slope nonlinearity shows that each recession event re occurs under different hydraulic diffusivity conditions between the stream hillslope therefore the streamflow recession characteristics should be considered in the effective parameterization of the catchment scale aquifer this study presents a new method for estimating catchment scale aquifer properties while accounting for distinct recession characteristics through event scale recession analysis in this work we used the recently developed be3s hong et al 2020 for 1 explicit incorporation of river stage observations as forcing data to account for the distinct recession characteristics and 2 numerical prediction of outflow from a boussinesq aquifer to comparatively evaluate analytically derived effective groundwater parameters we also addressed the relevance of the net subsurface discharge nsd observations in event scale recession analysis for the catchment scale aquifer parameterization specifically we found that the catchment scale nsd data plays a role in determining the initial saturated aquifer thickness dini and the size of contributing aquifer ac which varies in individual res the applicability of the proposed parameterization scheme was successfully validated for individual res with distinct recession slopes demonstrating that hydraulic diffusivity parameters can be estimated by explicitly incorporating recession characteristics as a catchment scale application of hydraulic groundwater theory we expect that the proposed scheme for effective groundwater parameterization will contribute to the accurate representation of the catchment scale stream hillslope hydrologic continuum keywords catchment scale aquifer properties event scale recession analysis boussinesq groundwater flow stream hillslope interactions net subsurface discharge fluxes 1 introduction in catchment hydrology representing potential driven subsurface flow between the river and the phreatic aquifer is an essential part of understanding catchment scale hydrologic processes over the last several decades a variety of studies have analyzed streamflow recession data to characterize the aquifer properties relying on the suggested method by brutsaert and nieber 1977 brutsaert and lopez 1998 mendoza et al 2003 pauwels and troch 2010 troch et al 1993 vannier et al 2014 their recession analysis is based on the analytical solutions to the boussinesq groundwater flow equation that describes subsurface drainages resulting from lateral head profile responding to the stream hillslope interactions hornberger et al 1970 lockington 1997 recession analysis has been commonly performed by constructing the data pair of dq dt and discharge q in bi logarithmic space with the assumption that catchment outflow is the drainage fluxes from a single homogeneous aquifer boussinesq 1903 1904 brutsaert and nieber 1977 the power law recession model describes the relationship between discharge q and its rate of change with time t eq 1 1 d q d t a q b as several analytical solutions to the boussinesq equation can be expressed in the form of eq 1 for horizontal aquifer boussinesq 1904 kochina 1962 lockington 1997 the brutsaert method provides one possibility to infer the aquifer properties from the parameters a and b in most analytical solutions b is a constant and a is considered to reflect the hydraulic properties of the phreatic aquifer the point cloud streamflow data have been utilized until recently for inferring effective aquifer parameters ploum et al 2019 vannier et al 2014 yeh and huang 2019 and several parameter fitting methods to determine a and b from the point cloud data have been proposed kirchner 2009 krakauer and temimi 2011 vogel and kroll 1992 however recent studies have found that the recession parameters from the point cloud data can be artifacts of the variability in individual recession events res jachens et al 2020a pointed out that the pattern in point cloud data can be reproduced by various combinations of individual res with different recession behaviors e g durations as well as antecedent conditions tashie et al 2020 showed that the lower envelope of the entire point cloud data does not reflect instantaneous aquifer state due to significant differences in the slope parameter b between individual res and point cloud and thus the recession parameter a from the aggregated data could not be wholly applicable to infer aquifer properties karlsen et al 2019 also found that the relationship between catchment properties e g topography and recession characteristics becomes more evident when the analysis is based on individual recession data while finding no relationships when recession data were lumped together significant differences between the recession parameters primarily slope parameter b derived from point cloud data e g central tendency estimates and individual recessions pose a question mark on the efficacy of the traditional recession method biswal and marani 2010 dralle et al 2017 jachens et al 2020a shaw and riha 2012 stoelzle et al 2013 tashie et al 2019 the recession slope parameter b typically has larger values i e steeper recession curves in individual res but is concealed in the aggregated recession plot the resulting reduction of b estimates might tend to overestimate the rates of streamflow declines systemically while underestimating the nonlinearity of streamflow recessions overall individual recession data is receiving increasing attention as an alternative to point cloud data for the accurate estimation of aquifer properties under variable conditions the use of individual recession data enables accounting for the variability in the recession characteristics across individual res considering that the variability in the recession parameters reflects that each re occurs under different hydraulic diffusivity conditions from the phreatic aquifer to the stream bart and hope 2014 the use of individual recession data for accurate estimation of aquifer properties is further justified moreover in the studies where the power law recession model is used for more explicit estimation of catchment scale aquifer properties e g horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and effective porosity f the subsurface drainage areas that effectively feed streamflow during the recessions are often assumed to be equal to the catchment area delineated by watershed boundary dataset wbd szilagyi et al 1998 tashie et al 2021 vannier et al 2014 however the size of the contributing aquifer i e stream feeding subsurface drainage area during the recessions could be significantly smaller than the wbd defined catchment area brutsaert and lopez 1998 brutsaert and nieber 1977 troch et al 1993 the assumption that the entire catchment area contributes to the streamflow q can be leading to significant errors in the catchment water balance during the recessions since the sensitivity of the boussinesq aquifer parameters ks and f to the size of the contributing aquifer are high vannier et al 2014 specifically the contributing aquifer area assumed larger than the actual size causes the overestimation of hydraulic diffusivity from the aquifer to the stream i e high ks and low f the overestimated hydraulic diffusivity might cause significant errors in the calculation of the catchment scale water budget therefore the size of contributing aquifer should be adequately determined for accurate estimation of boussinesq aquifer parameters and catchment water budget closure in most previous studies the falling limb of the hydrograph has been considered to reflect the rate at which water is drained from the catchment biswal and marani 2010 jachens et al 2020b roques et al 2017 szilagyi and parlange 1998 the dewatering aquifer is by the mathematical relationship between the boussinesq groundwater flow equation and the power law recession model one necessary assumption behind the traditional structuring of the recession analysis akylas and koussis 2007 szilagyi et al 1998 a variety of methods have been proposed to define the onset of an individual recession and the importance of the recession definitions lies in accounting for the presence of storm related quick flows such as overland runoff and macropore interflow most commonly the onset of individual res was defined by choosing a certain amount of time elapsed e g 0 h 6 h or 1 2 3 days after peak discharge however what is lacking in these methods is that the state of the river i e whether gaining or losing is not examined presuming the river is in gaining stream conditions after specific amounts of time as an example we present catchment observational data showing the comparative time series between the streamflow and net subsurface discharge nsd fluxes during the time of a re fig 1 the nsd time series generated by the differential gaging method an observationally based method used in this study for the nsd estimation mccallum et al 2012 rhodes et al 2017 turco 2007 indicates net hydrologic exchanges between the stream and hillslope and thus the river state in this example we defined the onset of a re at 6 h after peak discharge we found that the sign of nsd fluxes at the onset is negative implying the river is still a losing stream at the arbitrarily decided onset of the re the river transitioned from losing to gaining stream after 59 h from the onset of re i e the change of sign of nsd fluxes from negative to positive on 11 3 2017 at 15 00 00 this study thus poses the necessity of considering several additional aspects when deciding the onset of a re first the negative nsd at the start of the recession illustrates the need to consider river water infiltration into aquifers due to the rapid rise in river stages induced by a storm event during the falling limb of the hydrograph liang et al 2018 second the nsd fluxes should be positive at the onset of a re because the mathematical framework of recession analysis relies on gaining stream conditions in the river during the entire recession period therefore this study aims to present a new method for the accurate estimation of effective aquifer properties under variable hydraulic diffusivity conditions between stream hillslope through event scale recession analysis we considered different hydraulic diffusivity conditions between the stream and hillslope across individual res based on the recession parameters a and b karlsen et al 2019 and investigated if effective aquifer properties under specific hydraulic diffusivity conditions could be explicitly calculated from individual res with different recession parameters to achieve our objective we used a recently developed physically based be3s bidirectional exchange scheme in surface and subsurface hong et al 2020 for numerical representation of potential driven stream groundwater interactions during each recession the be3s incorporates the streamflow observations at the catchment inlet to force the most upstream node and simulates streamflow river stage profile throughout the stream so that the recession characteristics of each re can be adequately accounted for the be3s thus provides a unique capability to simulate catchment scale outflow from a boussinesq aquifer based on the transient horizontal hydraulic gradients between the stream groundwater which is infeasible in the current analytical models for the boussinesq equation rupp and selker 2006b hence the be3s enables the validation of boussinesq aquifer properties under transient hydraulic conditions with the corresponding catchment scale field nsd observational data we applied our method to a catchment of the delaware river with a well connected system of the stream and groundwater usgs 01462000 usgs 01463500 the applicability of the presented method for effective parameterization is extensively evaluated for various res with distinct recession characteristics 2 methods this section presents the theoretical framework of event scale recession analysis for effective parameterization with the use of the be3s including 1 the algorithmic description of the be3s for event scale recession analysis 2 the selection of analytical solutions for early time and late time domain and 3 the methods for recession extraction and recession parameter estimation from individual res 2 1 be3s numerical scheme the be3s couples 1 dimensional governing equations of richards equation boussinesq equation and saint venant equation to represent flow processes in the vadose zone phreatic aquifer and river respectively a complete coupled surface subsurface flow system should include surface and subsurface hydrologic components interfacial external boundary conditions and initial conditions in the forward modeling framework furman 2008 time dependent hydrologic states in each flow domain e g water table depth and river stage are explicitly used in establishing interfacial boundary conditions between adjacent domains the be3s connects two types of interfaces i e the interface between vadose zone aquifer and aquifer river and simulates the potential driven bidirectional exchanges while keeping the hydraulic consistency at the interfacial boundaries the mathematical framework of the be3s relies on the hybrid finite volume and difference discretization scheme which enables a node based dynamic coupling while lowering computational demands for solving the coupled governing equations pdes fig 2 d hong et al 2020 as we relied on the basic assumption that there is no further recharge or negligible during the recession period chapman 2003 wittenberg and sivapalan 1999 and little relation between recession rates and capillary fluxes due to relatively deep water table depth in the study area i e 4 5 m biswal and kumar 2014 shaw et al 2013 the be3s s richards equation based vadose zone module was disabled in this work 2 1 1 boussinesq equation based approach to represent the stream hillslope processes on catchment scale the be3s solves the nonlinear boussinesq equation derived from the dupuit assumption to simulate catchment outflow as the phreatic aquifer s response to a drawdown of river stage basha 2013 hornberger et al 1970 lockington 1997 the nonlinear form of the boussinesq equation is applied in a direction perpendicular to the flow direction of the river and incorporates the time dependent river stage during the time of recession as the boundary condition at the stream hillslope interface the hybrid discretization scheme in be3s also enables an efficient node configuration for solving the head based boussinesq equation applied with river stage boundary

during the course of res r was set to zero in eq 6 and thus the groundwater dynamics was solely resulted from the river stage boundary forcing and discharge interaction at the stream hillslope interface the hillslope scale boussinesq eq 1 d was utilized for representing catchment scale stream hillslope 2 d interactive processes i e reduction in dimensionality by defining each aquifer cell s minimum euclidean distance to the stream following the below procedure 1 each aquifer cell was assigned the minimum euclidean distance from the stream 2 the horizontal profile of d i j values was

aquifer during the recession flow d s g w d t was considered identical to the aquifer drainage rate q at the corresponding iteration 2 2 selection of analytical models the method of recession analysis is based on the boussinesq flow analytical models for an unconfined homogeneous rectangular aquifer as the be3s solves the nonlinear form of the boussinesq equation for a horizontal homogeneous aquifer in this work we selected analytical models that rely on the same assumptions i e nonlinear boussinesq equation flat bedrock and single homogenous aquifer theoretical catchment outflow from a boussinesq aquifer yields two hydraulic regimes beginning with an initially saturated aquifer subjected to instantaneous drawdown the analytical solutions of catchment outflow rate for small t can be obtained by the application of boltzmann similarity to boussinesq equation assuming that the aquifer width may be considered infinitely wide for small t kochina 1962 presented an exact solution for the desorptivity ds and derived the resulting catchment outflow rate model per unit stream length for early time domain kochina 1962 eq 9 9 q j 1 2 d s j δ t 1 2 0 6642 d i n i 3 2 k s f 2 j δ t where qj is the catchment outflow i e drainage per unit stream length at jth time step l2t 1 and thus j δt is the elapsed time from the onset of the recession to jth time step ks is the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 and f is the effective porosity dini is the initial saturated aquifer thickness l the recession parameters a and b were given as eqs 10 and 11 for this early time solution

reaches the upstream zero flux boundary rupp and selker 2006b troch et al 1993 for the late time flow regime we used an exact solution suggested by boussinesq 1904 based on boussinesq s late time

initial saturated aquifer thickness l b is the distance from the stream to the up slope zero flux boundary l and f is effective porosity again j δt is the elapsed time from the onset of the recession for this boussinesq s late time solution the recession parameters a and b are given by eq 13 and the power law streamflow recession model can be established as eq 14 13 a 4 804 k s 1 2 l f a c 3 2 b 1 5 14 d q d t 4 804 k s 1 2 l f a c 3 2 q 3 2 where ac is the subsurface drainage area that effectively contributes to streamflow during the recession period i e the contributing aquifer area l2 the parameter b is constant 3 2 in late time as mentioned in most previous cases ac has been considered identical to the size of the catchment delineated by the watershed boundary dataset wbd awbd under the assumption that the entire topographically driven catchment effectively contributes to streamflow recessions i e ac awbd to fill this gap we presented a parameter ꭤ that considers the proportion of the contributing aquifer s size to the wbd derived catchment area awbd we considered that the size of the contributing aquifer ac could be significantly smaller than the entire topographically delineated catchment area and thus the actual contributing aquifer area can be calculated by ꭤ awbd ꭤ ranging from 0 to 1 the ac in eq 14 was thus calculated based on the equation of ac ꭤ awbd 2 3 event scale recession analysis 2 3 1 recession extraction method the onset of an individual re has been defined as 1 or 2 days after the streamflow peaks in most previous studies to exclude storm related flow e g overland flow quick flow from input variables during the recession bart and hope 2014 biswal and marani 2010 brutsaert and nieber 1977 dralle et al 2017 shaw and riha 2012 as depicted in fig 1 however the state of a channel could remain as losing stream conditions even 2 or 3 d after peak discharge mainly due to higher hydraulic heads in the river to ensure the aquifer discharges water to streamflow during the entire recession period we focused on extracting only the recession period when the river is the gaining stream i e dewatering aquifer we defined the onset of the res as the transition point of the river from losing reach to gaining reach based on hourly net subsurface discharge nsd observations see section 3 2 as diurnal fluctuations are visible on the falling limb of the hourly observed hydrograph constantz 1998 szilágyi et al 2008 tallaksen 1995 we examined the consecutive decline of daily discharge data i e dq dt 0 t 1 d to decide the length i e recession duration of each re then the end of each re was considered to occur when the hourly discharge on the last day of each re is at the lowest 2 3 2 identification of the breakpoint from early time to late time domain and recession parameters for each selected re we set up the data pair of dq dt i e qi 1 qi δt δt 1 h and discharge q in bi logarithmic space the time derivative of baseflow recession rates dq dt is calculated using the variable time step vts scheme suggested by rupp and selker 2006a while the exponential time step ets method was studied to further reduce artifacts in the recession parameters compared to the vts method for the daily streamflow data roques et al 2017 we selected the vts method over the ets method since the diurnal fluctuations typically found in hourly streamflow data could not be securely avoided by the ets method with fixed parameters i e each time step should be adaptive on a recession curve qi is streamflow rate m3hr 1 where i 1 2 3 n n is the last time step in descending order so that q1 and qn are the largest and smallest flow rates of corresponding recession respectively to identify a breakpoint i e transition in hydraulic regimes between high flow i e early time domain and low flow i e late time domain we estimated mean square error mse and pearson s r from linear regression with a fixed slope of 3 0 while incrementing the number of the data pair in descending order for example r5 and mse5 are the pearson s r and mse over the data pairs of q1 q2 q3 q4 and q5 and corresponding dq dt derived from linear regression in bi logarithmic space a breakpoint of the change in baseflow regime i i for individual recessions was identified based on the significant changes in the values of r and mse that is 1 goodness of fit declines significantly from ri 1 to ri ghosh et al 2016 2 mse increases significantly from ri 1 to ri the significant changes in the values of mse and r from the linear regression with the fixed slope of 3 0 indicate the slope nonlinearity has changed at a particular time step implying the hydraulic regime change from high flow to low flow a linear regression model was then fitted to each data pair with the fixed slope b of 3 0 for the early time domain eq 11 and b of 1 5 for the late time domain eq 14 to estimate the intercept parameter a in each time domain 3 model domain and data description 3 1 study area our study area is the subsetted delaware river watershed located in the mid eastern part of pennsylvania according to the köppen geiger global climate classification map kottek et al 2006 the study area is humid subtropical warm temperature steppe and cool summer we use the huc hydrologic unit code 12 watershed boundary dataset wbd to determine the entire catchment area awbd the huc 12 represents the hydrologic unit boundaries to the sub watershed scale and tributary systems i e huc 12 digit within basins the total catchment area awbd is 263 28 km2 covering three creeks pidcock creek 103 66 km2 jacobs creek 97 12 km2 and buck creek 62 5 km2 the total stream length is estimated based on the flowline data in the national hydrography dataset plus nhdplus v2 0 dataset and consists of the main channel of 23 5 km length and the tributaries of 219 5 km fig 3a dewald et al 2012 3 2 model domain setup in the be3s framework each flow domain can have different resolutions so we set the lateral resolution of a cell in the river domain to 250 m and a cell in the groundwater domain to 50 m to lower the computational costs for each simulation while optimizing the be3s s performance in capturing baseflow recessions see section 4 1 the groundwater divides were assumed to follow the boundaries of catchments as groundwater divides coincide with regional topographic highs anderson et al 2015 each recession simulation runs under given conditions of ks f and horizontally uniform dini as consistent with the initial conditions of the theoretical structure of the selected analytical solutions for simplicity the channel bottom width bw was assumed to remain constant at a value of 100 m throughout the study reach since the channel upper width at the catchment inlet is roughly 75 of that at the outlet in normal flow conditions the ratio β γ was kept at 4 3 thus yielding β of 0 016 mm 1 and γ of 0 0125 mm 1 to best represent the respective rating curves at the inlet and outlet nodes fig 3c the manning coefficient mn as indicated in si1 was also used as a fitting parameter to best represent the time lag in the recession and estimated as 0 09 sm 1 3 the channel s slope was estimated by dividing the elevation difference between the inlet and outlet points by the distance between them yielding the slope value of 0 00057 mm 1 we also investigate soil textures across the study area to get some preliminary understanding of averaged characteristics of the catchment six types of soils are found across the study area with a relatively higher ratio of clay and silty clay loam in the riparian zone fig 3b 3 3 streamflow data two usgs gauges usgs 01462000 and 01463500 are located at the most upstream node and most downstream node of the catchment the two gauges recorded gage height and discharge data in 60 min interval the data is available in usgs 2016 we use hourly streamflow records over the last five years 2016 2020 and select individual res based on the proposed extraction method for event scale recession analysis 3 3 1 calculating net subsurface discharge from streamflow observations we estimated the nsd fluxes based on measured streamflow at the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the reach using the differential gaging method mccallum et al 2012 rhodes et al 2017 turco 2007 eq 15 according to the differential gaging method nsd due to groundwater inflow can be estimated following eq 15 the aim of eq 15 is to indirectly measure the aquifer drainage fluxes at the catchment scale and consider them nsd observational data 15 q g w q d j q u j t r i o e where qgw is the nsd fluxes during the corresponding time lag tr l3t 1 q d j is measured streamflow at the downstream boundary at jth time step l3t 1 and q u j is measured streamflow at the upstream boundary of the reach at jth time step l3t 1 the value of q d j q u j t r can be considered equivalent to the nsd observation l3t 1 at jth time step because during the recession periods i e low flow condition 1 the onset of each re occurred far later than the time of concentration to the mainstream in each huc12 delineated catchment estimated by t 0 827awbd 0 2 jr et al 1975 and thus tributary inflows i 0 2 there was no outflow to tributaries or pumping from the river so that o 0 and 3 water losses due to evaporation from free stream surface e was reported too small to be included in eq 15 i e the volume of water evaporated 0 02 m3 s so e 0 parker 1964 we identified the time lag tr by estimating r2 coefficient of determination between hydrographs at the inlet and the outlet with different values ranging from 0 to 15 h we considered the value yielding the highest r2 between the two hydrograph time series as the tr for the corresponding re we also constructed rating curves relating gage height l to streamflow rate l3t 1 at both gage stations the upstream gage r2 0 985 the downstream gage r2 0 999 as we could not find hourly discharge observations from the upstream gage the gage height data at the upstream gage usgs 01462000 was converted into discharge data supplemental information si2 and then used to evaluate channel water balance along with streamflow observations at the downstream gage usgs 01463500 4 results and discussion 4 1 the suitability of the combined use of the analytical models and be3s to evaluate the suitability of the combined use of the selected analytical models and be3s numerical model it is necessary to test the agreements between the be3s derived numerical solutions i e eq 5 and the analytical solutions of aquifer outflow fluxes i e early time eq 9 and late time eq 12 since the variability in the river stage at the discharge boundary was not considered in the analytical models i e derived based on zero river stage assumption the impact of the variability in river stage forcing hs considered in the be3s on the agreements between the analytical and numerical solutions should be addressed also as the horizontal resolution could significantly affect modeled q we tried to find an appropriate horizontal resolution that properly simulates the aquifer drainage fluxes q 4 1 1 the horizontal resolution for modeling aquifer drainage fluxes this experiment was performed on an hourly basis for a period of 10 days because early time recession flows do not typically last longer than 10 consecutive days the hydraulic conditions for this gaining reach experiment set up in the be3s are 1 hydraulic conductivity ks 1 0e 04 ms 1 and drainable porosity f 0 01 i e 1 2 river stages at jth time step at the discharge boundary follow a power function using the initial river stage h s j h s 0 t 0 01 representing a falling limb of the hydrograph after peak discharge 3 the initial head difference between initial saturated aquifer thickness and hs was set to 0 5 m i e h s j j 0 0 5 m d i n i and dini is 1 m the identical hydraulic conditions were applied to both analytical and numerical simulations we then evaluated the agreements between the analytical solutions and numerical solutions at five different horizontal resolutions 30 m 50 m 250 m 500 m and 1000 m to determine the optimal horizontal resolution in the be3s numerical simulations we found that the higher the lateral resolution is the higher agreements between the respective modeled aquifer drainage fluxes are the be3s derived q modeled at 30 m resolution produced the least error from the analytical solution which implies the need for a small enough horizontal resolution for adequately modeling the aquifer s outflow fluxes q during the recession period we also identified that the performances of the be3s derived subsurface drainage products simulated at a resolution of more than 250 m are not good enough to be used for simulating aquifer drainage in this work this is because the gaps between the be3s derived q products and the analytical solutions become rapidly larger due to the underestimated q in the numerical model when modeled at lateral resolutions larger than 250 m fig 4 a furthermore almost no temporal changes in the numerically derived q with a change in the river stage were identified when the resolution was larger than 250 m the be3s derived q at 50 m horizontal resolution was compared well with the corresponding analytical solutions while the modeled q at 50 m resolution for the first 24 h showed a bit of a drop in the performance compared to 30 m resolution we understand the similarly good estimation of the daily cumulative be3s derived q could compensate for the gap and yield drainage estimates accurate enough to model recession behavior in the early time domain we also considered the lower computational costs by increasing the horizontal resolution from 30 m to 50 m thus we considered 50 m as the optimal horizontal resolution for modeling q 4 1 2 the effects of the variability in river stage on the agreements between the analytical and numerical solutions given the horizontal resolution of 50 m for numerical simulation we analyzed the sensitivity of the be3s derived aquifer drainage q to the variability in the river stage the degree of the variability in river stage hs was represented by a parameter λ so the time series of hs at jth time step from the onset of the recession was decided by h s j h s 0 t λ as the impact of the variability in river stage on q could be varied by hydraulic conductivity ks we investigated the temporal variability and the total amount of q over the simulation period under a distinct combination of ks and λ the degree of the river stage variability was represented by four different values of λ i e 0 01 0 05 0 1 and 0 2 and the distinct saturated hydraulic conductivity conditions by four different values of ks i e 0 005 0 001 0 0001 and 0 00001 ms 1 the f value was kept at 1 in all the simulations the λ of 0 01 represented a case in which the river stage showed only minimal changes during the simulation period while λ of 0 2 represented an extreme case that the river stage decreased by 71 of the initial river stage at the end of the simulation similarly the ks of 0 005 and 0 00001 ms 1 depicted high and very low conductive conditions between the stream and hillslope respectively we identified that the temporal variability and the total amount of q were generally insensitive to the change in the λ value we found significant discrepancies of q only in the extreme cases in which both the rapid decrease of river stage and the very low conductivity between the stream hillslope e g λ 0 2 and ks 0 00001 ms 1 simultaneously occur that is the variability in the river stage does not significantly affect the temporal dynamics magnitudes of the q fluxes except when the horizontal head differences between the stream hillslope increase very rapidly the head difference that rapidly increases over time physically implies the stream hillslope interactions under 1 extremely low stream hillslope conductivity and 2 abrupt rapid decreases in the river stage fig 4d and e we thus found that both 1 the insensitiveness of q to changes in λ under general conditions of ks fig 4b and c and 2 the robust agreement between the analytical and numerical solutions of q at 50 m resolution more importantly these findings support the applicability of the be3s to evaluate the analytically derived aquifer properties by comparing the be3s derived nsd outputs with the corresponding nsd observations 4 2 determining the effective aquifer parameters on catchment scale through event scale recession analysis 4 2 1 recession parameter estimation through event scale recession analysis the variability in the recession parameters shows that each re occurs under different hydraulic diffusivity conditions from the aquifer to the stream leading to the different characterization of recession curves we investigated individual res during 2016 2020 that follow these criteria 1 the slope of a recession should be concave since our effective parameterization scheme relies on the outflow predictions from a boussinesq aquifer rupp and selker 2006b tashie et al 2020 2 the recession slope parameter b fitted with a best fit line through the entire individual re records should approximately range from 1 5 to 3 0 to be suitable for effective aquifer parameterization based on the early and late time solutions selected in this study we identified nine individual res that satisfies our criteria for the concavity the range of recession slope as well as nsd conditions see section 2 3 1 to estimate effective aquifer parameters derived from various hydraulic diffusivity conditions we selected four individual res out of the nine res showing gradual recession characteristics based on the values of the recession parameters a and b a larger b and lower a mean a slower stable decline rate for a given stream discharge and high nonlinearity likewise the smaller b and higher a represent fast steep streamflow decline with low nonlinearity i e close to linear we selected res with recession slope parameters b of 3 04 re 1 2 57 re 2 2 09 re 3 and 1 31 re 4 with intercept parameter log a of 7 00 5 67 4 55 and 2 82 respectively table 1 we note that the lowest log a and the highest b are found in re 1 and the highest log a and the lowest b are found in re 4 among the nine res thus the re1 4 represent gradual recession characteristics from the slowest recession with high nonlinearity i e re 1 to the fastest recession with low nonlinearity i e re 4 in the individual res identified used in this study the process workflow of estimating the catchment scale aquifer properties based on event scale recession analysis through the be3s derived numerical solutions and nsd data is described in fig 5 the start and end of each re are determined based on the proposed baseflow extraction method to separate two hydraulic regimes we identified a particular time step showing significant and abrupt changes in the value of mse and pearson s r from the constructed pairs of dq dt q and considered the transition point of the corresponding re to separate baseflow hydraulic regimes as an illustration we displayed how a breakpoint is decided according to our approach from re 1 in re 1 the mse increases from 4 62e 02 m3s 1 per hour to 1 53e 01 m3s 1 per hour while r declines from 0 69 to 0 65 with a sharp transition from the increasing trend to decreasing trend at 19 h after the onset of re 1 fig 6 similarly we determined the breakpoint in the four individual res and calculated the recession parameters for both the early and late time domains the information of the four res including the recession characteristics duration and the recession parameters a b for early and late time domains are listed in table 1 4 2 2 estimating catchment scale effective aquifer properties based on nsd observations in this section we showed how the net subsurface discharge observations could be used in event scale recession analysis to estimate catchment scale aquifer properties dini ac f and ks while further characterizing the stream aquifer hydraulic diffusivity dh the hydraulic diffusivity dh at the stream aquifer interface for unsteady drainage from a horizontal aquifer can be defined as dh hs ks f l2t 1 brutsaert 1994 brutsaert and lopez 1998 moutsopoulos 2013 4 2 2 1 initial saturated aquifer thickness dini we identified that the value of the initial saturated aquifer thickness affects the transition point of the river state from losing to gaining reach i e negative nsd positive nsd we estimated the sign and magnitude of the be3s derived nsd outputs from different dini values and tried to identify a dini value that represents the actual transition point of the river state in the nsd observations of the corresponding re since the size of contributing aquifer ac is another factor along with the dini that affects the ks and f between the stream hillslope the range of ꭤ should be adequately determined for a given dini to examine whether the transition from losing to gaining reach can occur under that dini value notably the hydraulic diffusivity increases non linearly with increasing size of contributing aquifer so the upper and lower bound of ꭤ was set up to meet these two assumptions 1 the effective porosity f should be ranging from 0 1 to 20 0 and 2 the catchment scale effective horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity ks should be less than 0 01 ms 1 ahuja et al 1989 dewandel et al 2012 troch et al 1993 we examined if the sign of the be3s derived nsd estimated at the onset of the recessions changes from negative to positive while incrementing dini value by 0 01 m i e 1 cm since the onset of individual res was determined based on the transition from losing to gaining reach we considered that the be3s derived nsd should shift from negative to positive at the onset of the res under the actual i e true dini to generate the be3s derived nsd we used the time series of hs at the upstream node from time lag before the time step of interest to force the upstream discharge boundary and summed the hourly q outputs for the corresponding time lag eq 6 for example the nsd estimated at the onset of re 1 i e 11 4 17 4 00 00 was calculated by summing hourly modeled q from 11 3 17 17 00 00 11 4 17 4 00 00 tr in re1 is 9 h using the river stage observations from 11 4 17 17 00 00 to force the most upstream node i e the catchment inlet it turned out that the be3s derived nsd fluxes have higher variability under the higher dh conditions with the increased size of contributing aquifer while the parameter ꭤ has significant effects on the magnitude of the cumulative nsd estimates the sign of the cumulative nsd does not change by the variability in parameter ꭤ under a given value of dini fig 7 shows that the parameter dini capturing the actual transition point of the river state can be determined as a single value at 1 cm resolution physically this finding implies that the initial saturated aquifer thickness dini is the main driver that determines the timing of the transition of the river state from losing to gaining reach during a re even under distinct hydraulic diffusivity conditions that different sizes of the contributing aquifer ac might cause we thus estimated the values of dini from the nsd observations which are 1 45 m 1 44 m 1 44 m and 1 46 m in re1 re2 re3 and re4 respectively 4 2 2 2 hillslope length b calculated from the contributing aquifer area ac based on the decided initial saturated aquifer thickness dini in each re we tried to estimate the area of contributing aquifer ac and corresponding hillslope length b as the effects from the tributaries on the mainstream during early late recession were not accounted for in the nsd simulations the hillslope length b can be calculated by dividing the determined ac with the mainstream length lm i e b ac 2 lm awbd ꭤ 2 lm the calculated hillslope length was also represented in the numerical simulations by constraining the np according to the b value in each re to achieve the assumption consistency between the analytical and numerical models the np in each re simulation was decided as k 1 if the inequality of 50 m k b m 50 m k 1 holds we used the nsd observations to estimate hillslope length b based on an optimized value of ꭤ for each re we assumed that the ks and f derived from the actual size of the contributing aquifer should yield the lowest statistical errors in temporal agreements and magnitudes pinault and schomburgk 2006 vrugt et al 2004 the nsd observations in each re were calculated by eq 15 based on the estimated tr for individual res which are 9 h in re1 5 h in re2 5 h in re3 5 h in re4 supplemental information si4 fig 8 shows the r2 and rmse between the be3s derived nsd outputs and the nsd observations according to the hillslope length b in each re we identified that the parameter ꭤ with the maximum r2 and the minimum rmse could be specified in re1 to re4 at 0 1 resolution the results showed the be3s derived nsd outputs best represent the corresponding nsd observations when ks and f derived from ꭤ 0 6 for re1 dini 1 45 m ꭤ 0 9 for re2 dini 1 44 m ꭤ 1 0 for re3 dini 1 44 m and ꭤ 1 3 for re4 dini 1 46 m are used therefore the b values could also be derived as 32 9 m for re1

m3 fig 9 a the effective aquifer parameters optimized for each re are summarized in table 2 the agreements of the nsd and river stage data showed the successful channel water balance during the selected res demonstrating that the recession characteristics in each re were adequately accounted for in the estimation of effective aquifer properties ks f dini and ꭤ fig 9b we also found that the temporal agreements between the modeled and observed nsd started to fail rapidly when the aquifer parameters ks and f derived from ꭤ roughly larger than 1 6 were used fig 8 these results show that the ks and f derived from the ac assumed larger than the contributing aquifer area in actual watersheds is very likely to overestimate the hydraulic diffusivity between stream hillslope resulting in the overestimation of aquifer drainage q and streamflow the presented method can explicitly calculate the range of the hydraulic diffusivity in individual res based on the modeled transient river stage and the estimated effective aquifer properties ks and f as expected in the variability of the recession characteristics among re1 4 we found a gradual increase in the hydraulic diffusivity estimates from re 1 through re 4 yielding the lowest value range of 0 00839 0 0165 m2s 1 in re 1 and the highest hydraulic diffusivity range of 0 132 0 096 m2s 1 in re 4 table 2 we note that the highest and lowest dh in each value range was estimated at the onset and end of the corresponding re respectively as the river stage hs gradually decreased during the recessions 4 2 3 validation of effective parameters based on recession characteristics as the recession characteristics reflect distinct hydraulic diffusivity conditions between the stream hillslope the effective parameters derived from a certain re should be applicable for other res with similar recession characteristics to close water budget i e nsd during recession flow therefore we applied the aquifer properties ks and f derived from re1 4 to the rest of res i e five res to validate the estimated ks and f we numbered the five res such that the recession rates increase with decreasing nonlinearity from re 5 i e log a 6 26 and b 2 72 to re 9 i e log a 3 21 and b 1 46 the recession parameters log a and b of re 5 9 are listed in table 3 the be3s derived nsd outputs predicted using the respective ks and f re1 4 were then compared with the corresponding nsd observations we found that the temporal variability of the nsd observation was generally well captured by the modeled nsd outputs from the four respective ks and f from re1 4 in all the re 5 9 however the be3s derived nsd yielded the least rmse when the respective ks and f were used to predict the nsd observed in a re with similar recession parameters table 3 for instance the ks and f derived from the re 4 showing fast decline rates with low nonlinearity predicted better the nsd observations in re 5 and 6 which showed similarly faster steeper recession characteristics i e similar b and log a values relative to the other res likewise the nsd observations in re 9 with slow declines and high nonlinearity were better predicted with the ks and f derived from re 1 which showed slow stable decline rates due to lower hydraulic diffusivity conditions between the stream aquifer for mid range log a and b we also identified that the effective parameters ks and f demonstrate better performance when used to predict the nsd fluxes of similar recession characteristics fig 10 while these results validate the proposed parameterization scheme s applicability the performance differences also emphasize that the effective aquifer properties and thus the stream hillslope hydraulic diffusivity should be estimated differently according to each re s recession characteristics 5 discussion limitation and future work the event scale recession analysis has been increasingly recognized as an alternative method to traditional aquifer parameterization using point cloud recession data we demonstrated that the event scale recession analysis is a promising methodology for estimating effective aquifer properties showing that different hydraulic diffusivity between the stream aquifer can be estimated by explicitly accounting for the variability in the recession characteristics through the combined use of the analytical models and the numerical be3s we tried to present one parameterization scheme for explicit calculation of aquifer properties this study therefore relies on the boussinesq flow assumption to interpret catchment scale nsd data since to date the mathematical relationship between the power law recession model and the boussinesq model for aquifer outflow is the only physically explicit method for aquifer parameterization care should therefore be taken in the selection of recession data as individual res with convex slopes i e increasing slope b as recession progresses or too high recession slopes i e higher than 3 0 are not expected to be suitable for aquifer parameterization based on the presented method due to the boussinesq assumption it is also worth noting that the recession slopes in observed individual res across actual watersheds typically increase with time in about 75 i e convex of the total res yielding only around 10 of the res with decreasing slopes over time i e concave tashie et al 2020 overall our effort not to use the boussinesq model to interpret non boussinesq flow was justified by selectively using recession records that satisfy the concavity and nonlinearity criteria from an individual recession record on the other hand the determination of the transition point from early to late time domain can significantly affect the final estimates of effective aquifer parameters due to nonlinear variability of hydraulic diffusivity per unit perimeter i e ks f with changing recession parameter a supplemental information si5 while the presented method for identifying the transition of hydraulic regimes in a recession event is conceptually consistent with previous studies ghosh et al 2016 jachens et al 2020a the method based on cumulative r and mse can still be susceptible to data points especially when multiple dq dt q outliers i e slower decrease in streamflow for a single time step are found in an hourly recession record in addition to the identification method based on the relative behavior of r and mse therefore further studies are needed to reduce the uncertainty associated with deciding the transition between the early and late time regimes for accurate estimation of the recession parameter a consequently this study explained distinct recession behavior across individual res and the time dependent degree of recession nonlinearities over the course of a re based on the functionality between hydraulic diffusivity condition and transient groundwater storage the relevance of the nsd data in event scale recession analysis specifically for effective aquifer parameterization has been argued throughout this article it starts from the efforts to satisfy the basic mathematical structure i e dewatering aquifer during the recession period of recession analysis through the estimation of dini based on the transition of river states i e losing to gaining reach the excellent agreements r2 0 96 between the be3s derived nsd and corresponding observations found in all the individual res demonstrate that the boussinesq aquifer assumption is the valid mathematical framework for aquifer parameterization more importantly to the best of our knowledge this work is the first case that attempts to explicitly estimate the actual contributing aquifer area ac by the ratio of ꭤ for better calibrated catchment scale effective aquifer hydraulic properties the feasibility of the estimated effective parameters has been ensured with catchment scale field nsd observations overall we encourage the use of the nsd data modeled and observed in the effective parameterization of catchment scale aquifer because of its various advantages to infer the states of lateral hydraulic gradients between the stream hillslope as well as the catchment scale channel water balance since our method is based on the boussinesq aquifer assumption the proposed parameterization scheme is expected to perform appropriately in regions where the streams and hillslopes are hydraulically well connected preferably gaining reach than the arid semi arid regions with deep water tables although as intended in this study we successfully presented a methodology for effective groundwater parameterization this study is also limited to drawing the general implications due to the small number of res and the site specific nature for example while we identified the increasing hillslope length b with decreasing b table 2 we cannot identify if this is a generalizable relationship between the contributing hillslope length b and recession characteristics due to the limited size of data the strength of explicit estimation of the catchment scale effective groundwater properties is to understand the role of the groundwater in the hydraulically connected surface subsurface system such as two way stream aquifer hydrologic modeling hong et al 2020 the catchment scale hydrologic similarity analysis lyon and troch 2010 saghafian et al 1995 sawicz et al 2011 and water energy availability on the land surface fan and miguez macho 2010 maxwell and condon 2016 rouholahnejad freund and kirchner 2017 especially for large scale integrated hydrologic models the presented boussinesq approximation based characterization of the catchment scale groundwater can facilitate conceptual clarity i e separate representation of the aquifer and channel and parametric efficiency in depicting the groundwater and its connectivity with the fluvial system thus leading to improved representation of stream hillslope hydrologic continuum fan et al 2019 unlike the methods in the existing models moreover the boussinesq based representation of the stream hillslope continuum considers local horizontal pressure gradient from stream ridge to hilltop as the driver of the stream hillslope two way continuum exchanges therefore future work can be summarized as 1 integrating the be3s into a large scale hydrologic model configuration for improved predictability of hydrologic variables 2 characterizing the catchment hillslope scale continuums based on effective parameters ks f dini and b and their relationships and 3 understanding the effects of the stream hillslope

38,accurate estimation of aquifer properties is of critical importance in representing the interactions between hydraulically connected surface subsurface systems the variability in recession characteristics i e decline rates and slope nonlinearity shows that each recession event re occurs under different hydraulic diffusivity conditions between the stream hillslope therefore the streamflow recession characteristics should be considered in the effective parameterization of the catchment scale aquifer this study presents a new method for estimating catchment scale aquifer properties while accounting for distinct recession characteristics through event scale recession analysis in this work we used the recently developed be3s hong et al 2020 for 1 explicit incorporation of river stage observations as forcing data to account for the distinct recession characteristics and 2 numerical prediction of outflow from a boussinesq aquifer to comparatively evaluate analytically derived effective groundwater parameters we also addressed the relevance of the net subsurface discharge nsd observations in event scale recession analysis for the catchment scale aquifer parameterization specifically we found that the catchment scale nsd data plays a role in determining the initial saturated aquifer thickness dini and the size of contributing aquifer ac which varies in individual res the applicability of the proposed parameterization scheme was successfully validated for individual res with distinct recession slopes demonstrating that hydraulic diffusivity parameters can be estimated by explicitly incorporating recession characteristics as a catchment scale application of hydraulic groundwater theory we expect that the proposed scheme for effective groundwater parameterization will contribute to the accurate representation of the catchment scale stream hillslope hydrologic continuum keywords catchment scale aquifer properties event scale recession analysis boussinesq groundwater flow stream hillslope interactions net subsurface discharge fluxes 1 introduction in catchment hydrology representing potential driven subsurface flow between the river and the phreatic aquifer is an essential part of understanding catchment scale hydrologic processes over the last several decades a variety of studies have analyzed streamflow recession data to characterize the aquifer properties relying on the suggested method by brutsaert and nieber 1977 brutsaert and lopez 1998 mendoza et al 2003 pauwels and troch 2010 troch et al 1993 vannier et al 2014 their recession analysis is based on the analytical solutions to the boussinesq groundwater flow equation that describes subsurface drainages resulting from lateral head profile responding to the stream hillslope interactions hornberger et al 1970 lockington 1997 recession analysis has been commonly performed by constructing the data pair of dq dt and discharge q in bi logarithmic space with the assumption that catchment outflow is the drainage fluxes from a single homogeneous aquifer boussinesq 1903 1904 brutsaert and nieber 1977 the power law recession model describes the relationship between discharge q and its rate of change with time t eq 1 1 d q d t a q b as several analytical solutions to the boussinesq equation can be expressed in the form of eq 1 for horizontal aquifer boussinesq 1904 kochina 1962 lockington 1997 the brutsaert method provides one possibility to infer the aquifer properties from the parameters a and b in most analytical solutions b is a constant and a is considered to reflect the hydraulic properties of the phreatic aquifer the point cloud streamflow data have been utilized until recently for inferring effective aquifer parameters ploum et al 2019 vannier et al 2014 yeh and huang 2019 and several parameter fitting methods to determine a and b from the point cloud data have been proposed kirchner 2009 krakauer and temimi 2011 vogel and kroll 1992 however recent studies have found that the recession parameters from the point cloud data can be artifacts of the variability in individual recession events res jachens et al 2020a pointed out that the pattern in point cloud data can be reproduced by various combinations of individual res with different recession behaviors e g durations as well as antecedent conditions tashie et al 2020 showed that the lower envelope of the entire point cloud data does not reflect instantaneous aquifer state due to significant differences in the slope parameter b between individual res and point cloud and thus the recession parameter a from the aggregated data could not be wholly applicable to infer aquifer properties karlsen et al 2019 also found that the relationship between catchment properties e g topography and recession characteristics becomes more evident when the analysis is based on individual recession data while finding no relationships when recession data were lumped together significant differences between the recession parameters primarily slope parameter b derived from point cloud data e g central tendency estimates and individual recessions pose a question mark on the efficacy of the traditional recession method biswal and marani 2010 dralle et al 2017 jachens et al 2020a shaw and riha 2012 stoelzle et al 2013 tashie et al 2019 the recession slope parameter b typically has larger values i e steeper recession curves in individual res but is concealed in the aggregated recession plot the resulting reduction of b estimates might tend to overestimate the rates of streamflow declines systemically while underestimating the nonlinearity of streamflow recessions overall individual recession data is receiving increasing attention as an alternative to point cloud data for the accurate estimation of aquifer properties under variable conditions the use of individual recession data enables accounting for the variability in the recession characteristics across individual res considering that the variability in the recession parameters reflects that each re occurs under different hydraulic diffusivity conditions from the phreatic aquifer to the stream bart and hope 2014 the use of individual recession data for accurate estimation of aquifer properties is further justified moreover in the studies where the power law recession model is used for more explicit estimation of catchment scale aquifer properties e g horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and effective porosity f the subsurface drainage areas that effectively feed streamflow during the recessions are often assumed to be equal to the catchment area delineated by watershed boundary dataset wbd szilagyi et al 1998 tashie et al 2021 vannier et al 2014 however the size of the contributing aquifer i e stream feeding subsurface drainage area during the recessions could be significantly smaller than the wbd defined catchment area brutsaert and lopez 1998 brutsaert and nieber 1977 troch et al 1993 the assumption that the entire catchment area contributes to the streamflow q can be leading to significant errors in the catchment water balance during the recessions since the sensitivity of the boussinesq aquifer parameters ks and f to the size of the contributing aquifer are high vannier et al 2014 specifically the contributing aquifer area assumed larger than the actual size causes the overestimation of hydraulic diffusivity from the aquifer to the stream i e high ks and low f the overestimated hydraulic diffusivity might cause significant errors in the calculation of the catchment scale water budget therefore the size of contributing aquifer should be adequately determined for accurate estimation of boussinesq aquifer parameters and catchment water budget closure in most previous studies the falling limb of the hydrograph has been considered to reflect the rate at which water is drained from the catchment biswal and marani 2010 jachens et al 2020b roques et al 2017 szilagyi and parlange 1998 the dewatering aquifer is by the mathematical relationship between the boussinesq groundwater flow equation and the power law recession model one necessary assumption behind the traditional structuring of the recession analysis akylas and koussis 2007 szilagyi et al 1998 a variety of methods have been proposed to define the onset of an individual recession and the importance of the recession definitions lies in accounting for the presence of storm related quick flows such as overland runoff and macropore interflow most commonly the onset of individual res was defined by choosing a certain amount of time elapsed e g 0 h 6 h or 1 2 3 days after peak discharge however what is lacking in these methods is that the state of the river i e whether gaining or losing is not examined presuming the river is in gaining stream conditions after specific amounts of time as an example we present catchment observational data showing the comparative time series between the streamflow and net subsurface discharge nsd fluxes during the time of a re fig 1 the nsd time series generated by the differential gaging method an observationally based method used in this study for the nsd estimation mccallum et al 2012 rhodes et al 2017 turco 2007 indicates net hydrologic exchanges between the stream and hillslope and thus the river state in this example we defined the onset of a re at 6 h after peak discharge we found that the sign of nsd fluxes at the onset is negative implying the river is still a losing stream at the arbitrarily decided onset of the re the river transitioned from losing to gaining stream after 59 h from the onset of re i e the change of sign of nsd fluxes from negative to positive on 11 3 2017 at 15 00 00 this study thus poses the necessity of considering several additional aspects when deciding the onset of a re first the negative nsd at the start of the recession illustrates the need to consider river water infiltration into aquifers due to the rapid rise in river stages induced by a storm event during the falling limb of the hydrograph liang et al 2018 second the nsd fluxes should be positive at the onset of a re because the mathematical framework of recession analysis relies on gaining stream conditions in the river during the entire recession period therefore this study aims to present a new method for the accurate estimation of effective aquifer properties under variable hydraulic diffusivity conditions between stream hillslope through event scale recession analysis we considered different hydraulic diffusivity conditions between the stream and hillslope across individual res based on the recession parameters a and b karlsen et al 2019 and investigated if effective aquifer properties under specific hydraulic diffusivity conditions could be explicitly calculated from individual res with different recession parameters to achieve our objective we used a recently developed physically based be3s bidirectional exchange scheme in surface and subsurface hong et al 2020 for numerical representation of potential driven stream groundwater interactions during each recession the be3s incorporates the streamflow observations at the catchment inlet to force the most upstream node and simulates streamflow river stage profile throughout the stream so that the recession characteristics of each re can be adequately accounted for the be3s thus provides a unique capability to simulate catchment scale outflow from a boussinesq aquifer based on the transient horizontal hydraulic gradients between the stream groundwater which is infeasible in the current analytical models for the boussinesq equation rupp and selker 2006b hence the be3s enables the validation of boussinesq aquifer properties under transient hydraulic conditions with the corresponding catchment scale field nsd observational data we applied our method to a catchment of the delaware river with a well connected system of the stream and groundwater usgs 01462000 usgs 01463500 the applicability of the presented method for effective parameterization is extensively evaluated for various res with distinct recession characteristics 2 methods this section presents the theoretical framework of event scale recession analysis for effective parameterization with the use of the be3s including 1 the algorithmic description of the be3s for event scale recession analysis 2 the selection of analytical solutions for early time and late time domain and 3 the methods for recession extraction and recession parameter estimation from individual res 2 1 be3s numerical scheme the be3s couples 1 dimensional governing equations of richards equation boussinesq equation and

depth and river stage are explicitly used in establishing interfacial boundary conditions between adjacent domains the be3s connects two types of interfaces i e the interface between vadose zone aquifer and aquifer river and simulates the potential driven bidirectional exchanges while keeping the hydraulic consistency at the interfacial boundaries the mathematical framework of the be3s relies on the hybrid finite volume and difference discretization scheme which enables a node based dynamic coupling while lowering computational demands for solving the coupled governing equations pdes fig 2

the dupuit assumption to simulate catchment outflow as the phreatic aquifer s response to a drawdown of river stage basha 2013 hornberger et al 1970 lockington 1997 the nonlinear form of the boussinesq equation is applied in a direction perpendicular to the flow direction of the river and incorporates the time dependent river stage during the time of recession as the boundary condition at the stream hillslope interface the hybrid discretization scheme in be3s also enables an efficient node configuration for solving the head based boussinesq equation applied with river stage boundary

is based on the boussinesq flow analytical models for an unconfined homogeneous rectangular aquifer as the be3s solves the nonlinear form of the boussinesq equation for a horizontal homogeneous aquifer in this work we selected analytical models that rely on the same assumptions i e nonlinear boussinesq equation flat bedrock and single homogenous aquifer theoretical catchment outflow from a boussinesq aquifer yields two hydraulic regimes beginning with an initially saturated aquifer subjected to instantaneous drawdown the analytical solutions of catchment outflow rate for small t can be obtained by the application of boltzmann similarity to boussinesq equation assuming that the aquifer width may be considered infinitely wide for small t kochina 1962 presented an exact solution for

parameter b is constant 3 2 in late time as mentioned in most previous cases ac has been considered identical to the size of the catchment delineated by the watershed boundary dataset wbd awbd under the assumption that the entire topographically driven catchment effectively contributes to streamflow recessions i e ac awbd to fill this gap we presented a parameter ꭤ that considers the proportion of the contributing aquifer s size to the wbd derived catchment area awbd we considered that the size of the contributing aquifer ac could be significantly smaller than the entire topographically delineated catchment area and thus the actual contributing aquifer area can be calculated by ꭤ awbd ꭤ ranging from 0 to 1 the ac in eq 14 was thus calculated based on the equation of ac ꭤ awbd 2 3 event scale recession analysis 2 3 1 recession extraction method the onset of an individual re has been defined as 1 or 2 days after the streamflow peaks in most previous studies to exclude storm related flow e g overland flow quick flow from input variables during the recession bart and hope 2014 biswal and marani 2010 brutsaert and nieber 1977 dralle et al 2017 shaw and riha 2012 as depicted in fig 1 however the state of a channel could remain as losing stream conditions even 2 or 3 d after peak discharge mainly due to higher hydraulic heads in the river to ensure the aquifer discharges water to streamflow during the entire recession period we focused on extracting only the recession period when the river is the gaining stream i e dewatering aquifer we defined the onset of the res as the transition point of the river from losing reach to gaining reach based on hourly net subsurface discharge nsd observations see section 3 2 as diurnal fluctuations are visible on the falling limb of the hourly observed hydrograph constantz 1998 szilágyi et al 2008 tallaksen 1995 we examined the consecutive decline of daily discharge data i e dq dt 0 t 1 d to decide the length i e recession duration of each re then the end of each re was considered to occur when the hourly discharge on the last day of each re is at the lowest 2 3 2 identification of the breakpoint from early time to late time domain and recession parameters for each selected re we set up the data pair of dq dt i e qi 1 qi δt δt 1 h and discharge q in bi logarithmic space the time derivative of baseflow recession rates dq dt is calculated using the variable time step vts scheme suggested by rupp and selker 2006a while the exponential time step ets method was studied to further reduce artifacts in the recession parameters compared to the vts method for the daily streamflow data roques et al 2017 we selected the vts method over the ets method since the diurnal fluctuations typically found in hourly streamflow data could not be securely avoided by the ets method with fixed parameters i e each time step should be adaptive on a recession curve qi is streamflow rate m3hr 1 where i 1 2 3 n n is the last time step in descending order so that q1 and qn are the largest and smallest flow rates of corresponding recession respectively to identify a breakpoint i e transition in hydraulic regimes between high flow i e early time domain and low flow i e late time domain we estimated mean square error mse and pearson s r from linear regression with a fixed slope of 3 0 while incrementing the number of the data pair in descending order for example r5 and mse5 are the pearson s r and mse over the data pairs of q1 q2 q3 q4 and q5 and corresponding dq dt derived from linear regression in bi logarithmic space a breakpoint of the change in baseflow regime i i for individual recessions was identified based on the significant changes in the values of r and mse that is 1 goodness of fit declines significantly from ri 1 to ri ghosh et al 2016 2 mse increases significantly from ri 1 to ri the significant changes in the values of mse and r from the linear regression with the fixed slope of 3 0 indicate the slope nonlinearity has changed at a particular time step implying the hydraulic regime change from high flow to low flow a linear regression model was then fitted to each data pair with the fixed slope b of 3 0 for the early time domain eq 11 and b of 1 5 for the late time domain eq 14 to estimate the intercept parameter a in each time domain 3 model domain and data description 3 1 study area our study area is the subsetted delaware river watershed located in the mid eastern part of pennsylvania according to the köppen geiger global climate classification map kottek et al 2006 the study area is humid subtropical warm temperature steppe and cool summer we use the huc hydrologic unit code 12 watershed boundary dataset wbd to determine the entire catchment area awbd the huc 12 represents the hydrologic unit boundaries to the sub watershed scale and tributary systems i e huc 12 digit within basins the total catchment area awbd is 263 28 km2 covering three creeks pidcock creek 103 66 km2 jacobs creek 97 12 km2 and buck creek 62 5 km2 the total stream length is estimated based on the flowline data in the national hydrography dataset plus nhdplus v2 0 dataset and consists of the main channel of 23 5 km length and the tributaries of 219 5 km fig 3a dewald et al 2012 3 2 model domain setup in the be3s framework each flow domain can have different resolutions so we set the lateral resolution of a cell in the river domain to 250 m and a cell in the groundwater domain to 50 m to lower the computational costs for each simulation while optimizing the be3s s performance in capturing baseflow recessions see section 4 1 the groundwater divides were assumed to follow the boundaries of catchments as groundwater divides coincide with regional topographic highs anderson et al 2015 each recession simulation runs under given conditions of ks f and horizontally uniform dini as consistent with the initial conditions of the theoretical structure of the selected analytical solutions for simplicity the channel bottom width bw was assumed to remain constant at a value of 100 m throughout the study reach since the channel upper width at the catchment inlet is roughly 75 of that at the outlet in normal flow conditions the ratio β γ was kept at 4 3 thus yielding β of 0 016 mm 1 and γ of 0 0125 mm 1 to best represent the respective rating curves at the inlet and outlet nodes fig 3c the manning coefficient mn as indicated in si1 was also used as a fitting parameter to best represent the time lag in the recession and estimated as 0 09 sm 1 3 the channel s slope was estimated by dividing the elevation difference between the inlet and outlet points by the distance between them yielding the slope value of 0 00057 mm 1 we also investigate soil textures across the study area to get some preliminary understanding of averaged characteristics of the catchment six types of soils are found across the study area with a relatively higher ratio of clay and silty clay loam in the riparian zone fig 3b 3 3 streamflow data two usgs gauges usgs 01462000 and 01463500 are located at the most upstream node and most downstream node of the catchment the two gauges recorded gage height and discharge data in 60 min interval the data is available in usgs 2016 we use hourly streamflow records over the last five years 2016 2020 and select individual res based on the proposed extraction method for event scale recession analysis 3 3 1 calculating net subsurface discharge from streamflow observations we estimated the nsd fluxes based on measured streamflow at the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the reach using the differential gaging method mccallum et al 2012 rhodes et al 2017 turco 2007 eq 15 according to the differential gaging method nsd due to groundwater inflow can be estimated following eq 15 the aim of eq 15 is to indirectly measure the aquifer drainage fluxes at the catchment scale and consider them nsd observational data 15 q g w q d j q u j t r i o e where qgw is the nsd fluxes during the corresponding time lag tr l3t 1 q d j is measured streamflow at the downstream boundary at jth time step l3t 1 and q u j is measured streamflow at the upstream boundary of the reach at jth time step l3t 1 the value of q d j q u j t r can be considered equivalent to the nsd observation l3t 1 at jth time step because during the recession periods i e low flow condition 1 the onset of each re occurred far later than the time of concentration to the mainstream in each huc12 delineated catchment estimated by t 0 827awbd 0 2 jr et al 1975 and thus tributary inflows i 0 2 there was no outflow to tributaries or pumping from the river so that o 0 and 3 water losses due to evaporation from free stream surface e was reported too small to be included in eq 15 i e the volume of water evaporated 0 02 m3 s so e 0 parker 1964 we identified the time lag tr by estimating r2 coefficient of determination between hydrographs at the inlet and the outlet with different values ranging from 0 to 15 h we considered the value yielding the highest r2 between the two hydrograph time series as the tr for the corresponding re we also constructed rating curves relating gage height l to streamflow rate l3t 1 at both gage stations the upstream gage r2 0 985 the downstream gage r2 0 999 as we could not find hourly discharge observations from the upstream gage the gage height data at the upstream gage usgs 01462000 was converted into discharge data supplemental information si2 and then used to evaluate channel water balance along with streamflow observations at the downstream gage usgs 01463500 4 results and discussion 4 1 the suitability of the combined use of the analytical models and be3s to evaluate the suitability of the combined use of the selected analytical models and be3s numerical model it is necessary to test the agreements between the be3s derived numerical solutions i e eq 5 and the analytical solutions of aquifer outflow fluxes i e early time eq 9 and late time eq 12 since the variability in the river stage at the discharge boundary was not considered in the analytical models i e derived based on zero river stage assumption the impact of the variability in river stage forcing hs considered in the be3s on the agreements between the analytical and numerical solutions should be addressed also as the horizontal resolution could significantly affect modeled q we tried to find an appropriate horizontal resolution that properly simulates the aquifer drainage fluxes q 4 1 1 the horizontal resolution for modeling aquifer drainage fluxes this experiment was performed on an hourly basis for a period of 10 days because early time recession flows do not typically last longer than 10 consecutive days the hydraulic conditions for this gaining reach experiment set up in the be3s are 1 hydraulic conductivity ks 1 0e 04 ms 1 and drainable porosity f 0 01 i e 1 2 river stages at jth time step at the discharge boundary follow a power function using the initial river stage h s j h s 0 t 0 01 representing a falling limb of the hydrograph after peak discharge 3 the initial head difference between initial saturated aquifer thickness and hs was set to 0 5 m i e h s j j 0 0 5 m d i n i and dini is 1 m the identical hydraulic conditions were applied to both analytical and numerical simulations we then evaluated the agreements between the analytical solutions and numerical solutions at five different horizontal resolutions 30 m 50 m 250 m 500 m and 1000 m to determine the optimal horizontal resolution in the be3s numerical simulations we found that the higher the lateral resolution is the higher agreements between the respective modeled aquifer drainage fluxes are the be3s derived q modeled at 30 m resolution produced the least error from the analytical solution which implies the need for a small enough horizontal resolution for adequately modeling the aquifer s outflow fluxes q during the recession period we also identified that the performances of the be3s derived subsurface drainage products simulated at a resolution of more than 250 m are not good enough to be used for simulating aquifer drainage in this work this is because the gaps between the be3s derived q products and the analytical solutions become rapidly larger due to the underestimated q in the numerical model when modeled at lateral resolutions larger than 250 m fig 4 a furthermore almost no temporal changes in the numerically derived q with a change in the river stage were identified when the resolution was larger than 250 m the be3s derived q at 50 m horizontal resolution was compared well with the corresponding analytical solutions while the modeled q at 50 m resolution for the first 24 h showed a bit of a drop in the performance compared to 30 m resolution we understand the similarly good estimation of the daily cumulative be3s derived q could compensate for the gap and yield drainage estimates accurate enough to model recession behavior in the early time domain we also considered the lower computational costs by increasing the horizontal resolution from 30 m to 50 m thus we considered 50 m as the optimal horizontal resolution for modeling q 4 1 2 the effects of the variability in river stage on the agreements between the analytical and numerical solutions given the horizontal resolution of 50 m for numerical simulation we analyzed the sensitivity of the be3s derived aquifer drainage q to the variability in the river stage the degree of the variability in river stage hs was represented by a parameter λ so the time series of hs at jth time step from the onset of the recession was decided by h s j h s 0 t λ as the impact of the variability in river stage on q could be varied by hydraulic conductivity ks we investigated the temporal variability and the total amount of q over the simulation period under a distinct combination of ks and λ the degree of the river stage variability was represented by four different values of λ i e 0 01 0 05 0 1 and 0 2 and the distinct saturated hydraulic conductivity conditions by four different values of ks i e 0 005 0 001 0 0001 and 0 00001 ms 1 the f value was kept at 1 in all the simulations the λ of 0 01 represented a case in which the river stage showed only minimal changes during the simulation period while λ of 0 2 represented an extreme case that the river stage decreased by 71 of the initial river stage at the end of the simulation similarly the ks of 0 005 and 0 00001 ms 1 depicted high and very low conductive conditions between the stream and hillslope respectively we identified that the temporal variability and the total amount of q were generally insensitive to the change in the λ value we found significant discrepancies of q only in the extreme cases in which both the rapid decrease of river stage and the very low conductivity between the stream hillslope e g λ 0 2 and ks 0 00001 ms 1 simultaneously occur that is the variability in the river stage does not significantly affect the temporal dynamics magnitudes of the q fluxes except when the horizontal head differences between the stream hillslope increase very rapidly the head difference that rapidly increases over time physically implies the stream hillslope interactions under 1 extremely low stream hillslope conductivity and 2 abrupt rapid decreases in the river stage fig 4d and e we thus found that both 1 the insensitiveness of q to changes in λ under general conditions of ks fig 4b and c and 2 the robust agreement between the analytical and numerical solutions of q at 50 m resolution more importantly these findings support the applicability of the be3s to evaluate the analytically derived aquifer properties by comparing the be3s derived nsd outputs with the corresponding nsd observations 4 2 determining the effective aquifer parameters on catchment scale through event scale recession analysis 4 2 1 recession parameter estimation through event scale recession analysis the variability in the recession parameters shows that each re occurs under different hydraulic diffusivity conditions from the aquifer to the stream leading to the different characterization of recession curves we investigated individual res during 2016 2020 that follow these criteria 1 the slope of a recession should be concave since our effective parameterization scheme relies on the outflow predictions from a boussinesq aquifer rupp and selker 2006b tashie et al 2020 2 the recession slope parameter b fitted with a best fit line through the entire individual re records should approximately range from 1 5 to 3 0 to be suitable for effective aquifer parameterization based on the early and late time solutions selected in this study we identified nine individual res that satisfies our criteria for the concavity the range of recession slope as well as nsd conditions see section 2 3 1 to estimate effective aquifer parameters derived from various hydraulic diffusivity conditions we selected four individual res out of the nine res showing gradual recession characteristics based on the values of the recession parameters a and b a larger b and lower a mean a slower stable decline rate for a given stream discharge and high nonlinearity likewise the smaller b and higher a represent fast steep streamflow decline with low nonlinearity i e close to linear we selected res with recession slope parameters b of 3 04 re 1 2 57 re 2 2 09 re 3 and 1 31 re 4 with intercept parameter log a of 7 00 5 67 4 55 and 2 82 respectively table 1 we note that the lowest log a and the highest b are found in re 1 and the highest log a and the lowest b are found in re 4 among the nine res thus the re1 4 represent gradual recession characteristics from the slowest recession with high nonlinearity i e re 1 to the fastest recession with low nonlinearity i e re 4 in the individual res identified used in this study the process workflow of estimating the catchment scale aquifer properties based on event scale recession analysis through the be3s derived numerical solutions and nsd data is described in fig 5 the start and end of each re are determined based on the proposed baseflow extraction method to separate two hydraulic regimes we identified a particular time step showing significant and abrupt changes in the value of mse and pearson s r from the constructed pairs of dq dt q and considered the transition point of the corresponding re to separate baseflow hydraulic regimes as an illustration we displayed how a breakpoint is decided according to our approach from re 1 in re 1 the mse increases from 4 62e 02 m3s 1 per hour to 1 53e 01 m3s 1 per hour while r declines from 0 69 to 0 65 with a sharp transition from the increasing trend to decreasing trend at 19 h after the onset of re 1 fig 6 similarly we determined the breakpoint in the four individual res and calculated the recession parameters for both the early and late time domains the information of the four res including the recession characteristics duration and the recession parameters a b for early and late time domains are listed in table 1 4 2 2 estimating catchment scale effective aquifer properties based on nsd observations in this section we showed how the net subsurface discharge observations could be used in event scale recession analysis to estimate catchment scale aquifer properties dini ac f and ks while further characterizing the stream aquifer hydraulic diffusivity dh the hydraulic diffusivity dh at the stream aquifer interface for unsteady drainage from a horizontal aquifer can be defined as dh hs ks f l2t 1 brutsaert 1994 brutsaert and lopez 1998 moutsopoulos 2013 4 2 2 1 initial saturated aquifer thickness dini we identified that the value of the initial saturated aquifer thickness affects the transition point of the river state from losing to gaining reach i e negative nsd positive nsd we estimated the sign and magnitude of the be3s derived nsd outputs from different dini values and tried to identify a dini value that represents the actual transition point of the river state in the nsd observations of the corresponding re since the size of contributing aquifer ac is another factor along with the dini that affects the ks and f between the stream hillslope the range of ꭤ should be adequately determined for a given dini to examine whether the transition from losing to gaining reach can occur under that dini value notably the hydraulic diffusivity increases non linearly with increasing size of contributing aquifer so the upper and lower bound of ꭤ was set up to meet these two assumptions 1 the effective porosity f should be ranging from 0 1 to 20 0 and 2 the catchment scale effective horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity ks should be less than 0 01 ms 1 ahuja et al 1989 dewandel et al 2012 troch et al 1993 we examined if the sign of the be3s derived nsd estimated at the onset of the recessions changes from negative to positive while incrementing dini value by 0 01 m i e 1 cm since the onset of individual res was determined based on the transition from losing to gaining reach we considered that the be3s derived nsd should shift from negative to positive at the onset of the res under the actual i e true dini to generate the be3s derived nsd we used the time series of hs at the upstream node from time lag before the time step of interest to force the upstream discharge boundary and summed the hourly q outputs for the corresponding time lag eq 6 for example the nsd estimated at the onset of re 1 i e 11 4 17 4 00 00 was calculated by summing hourly modeled q from 11 3 17 17 00 00 11 4 17 4 00 00 tr in re1 is 9 h using the river stage observations from 11 4 17 17 00 00 to force the most upstream node i e the catchment inlet it turned out that the be3s derived nsd fluxes have higher variability under the higher dh conditions with the increased size of contributing aquifer while the parameter ꭤ has significant effects on the magnitude of the cumulative nsd estimates the sign of the cumulative nsd does not change by the variability in parameter ꭤ under a given value of dini fig 7 shows that the parameter dini capturing the actual transition point of the river state can be determined as a single value at 1 cm resolution physically this finding implies that the initial saturated aquifer thickness dini is the main driver that determines the timing of the transition of the river state from losing to gaining reach during a re even under distinct hydraulic diffusivity conditions that different sizes of the contributing aquifer ac might cause we thus estimated the values of dini from the nsd observations which are 1 45 m 1 44 m 1 44 m and 1 46 m in re1 re2 re3 and re4 respectively 4 2 2 2 hillslope length b calculated from the contributing aquifer area ac based on the decided initial saturated aquifer thickness dini in each re we tried to estimate the area of contributing aquifer ac and corresponding hillslope length b as the effects from the tributaries on the mainstream during early late recession were not accounted for in the nsd simulations the hillslope length b can be calculated by dividing the determined ac with the mainstream length lm i e b ac 2 lm awbd ꭤ 2 lm the calculated hillslope length was also represented in the numerical simulations by constraining the np according to the b value in each re to achieve the assumption consistency between the analytical and numerical models the np in each re simulation was decided as k 1 if the inequality of 50 m k b m 50 m k 1 holds we used the nsd observations to estimate hillslope length b based on an optimized value of ꭤ for each re we assumed that the ks and f derived from the actual size of the contributing aquifer should yield the lowest statistical errors in temporal agreements and magnitudes pinault and schomburgk 2006 vrugt et al 2004 the nsd observations in each re were calculated by eq 15 based on the estimated tr for individual res which are 9 h in re1 5 h in re2 5 h in re3 5 h in re4 supplemental information si4 fig 8 shows the r2 and rmse between the be3s derived nsd outputs and the nsd observations according to the hillslope length b in each re we identified that the parameter ꭤ with the maximum r2 and the minimum rmse could be specified in re1 to re4 at 0 1 resolution the results showed the be3s derived nsd outputs best represent the corresponding nsd observations when ks and f derived from ꭤ 0 6 for re1 dini 1 45 m ꭤ 0 9 for re2 dini 1 44 m ꭤ 1 0 for re3 dini 1 44 m and ꭤ 1 3 for re4 dini 1 46 m are used therefore the b values could also be derived as 32 9 m for re1 ac 1 58 106 m2 52 7 m for re2 ac 2 36 106 m2 56 4 m for re3 ac 2 63 106 m2 and 71 3 m for re4 ac 3 42 106 m2 table 2 the be3s derived nsd outputs simulated with the determined ks and f agree well with the corresponding nsd observations showing accurate water budget closure on catchment scale re1 r2 0 967 rmse 30 843 m3 re2 r2 0 992 rmse 14 319 m3 re3 r2 0 993 rmse 21 240 m3 re4 r2 0 979 rmse 25 314 m3 fig 9 a the effective aquifer parameters optimized for each re are summarized in table 2 the agreements of the nsd and river stage data showed the successful channel water balance during the selected res demonstrating that the recession characteristics in each re were adequately accounted for in the estimation of effective aquifer properties ks f dini and ꭤ fig 9b we also found that the temporal agreements between the modeled and observed nsd started to fail rapidly when the aquifer parameters ks and f derived from ꭤ roughly larger than 1 6 were used fig 8 these results show that the ks and f derived from the ac assumed larger than the contributing aquifer area in actual watersheds is very likely to overestimate the hydraulic diffusivity between stream hillslope resulting in the overestimation of aquifer drainage q and streamflow the presented method can explicitly calculate the range of the hydraulic diffusivity in individual res based on the modeled transient river stage and the estimated effective aquifer properties ks and f as expected in the variability of the recession characteristics among re1 4 we found a gradual increase in the hydraulic diffusivity estimates from re 1 through re 4 yielding the lowest value range of 0 00839 0 0165 m2s 1 in re 1 and the highest hydraulic diffusivity range of 0 132 0 096 m2s 1 in re 4 table 2 we note that the highest and lowest dh in each value range was estimated at the onset and end of the corresponding re respectively as the river stage hs gradually decreased during the recessions 4 2 3 validation of effective parameters based on recession characteristics as the recession characteristics reflect distinct hydraulic diffusivity conditions between the stream hillslope the effective parameters derived from a certain re should be applicable for other res with similar recession characteristics to close water budget i e nsd during recession flow therefore we applied the aquifer properties ks and f derived from re1 4 to the rest of res i e five res to validate the estimated ks and f we numbered the five res such that the recession rates increase with decreasing nonlinearity from re 5 i e log a 6 26 and b 2 72 to re 9 i e log a 3 21 and b 1 46 the recession parameters log a and b of re 5 9 are listed in table 3 the be3s derived nsd outputs predicted using the respective ks and f re1 4 were then compared with the corresponding nsd observations we found that the temporal variability of the nsd observation was generally well captured by the modeled nsd outputs from the four respective ks and f from re1 4 in all the re 5 9 however the be3s derived nsd yielded the least rmse when the respective ks and f were used to predict the nsd observed in a re with similar recession parameters table 3 for instance the ks and f derived from the re 4 showing fast decline rates with low nonlinearity predicted better the nsd observations in re 5 and 6 which showed similarly faster steeper recession characteristics i e similar b and log a values relative to the other res likewise the nsd observations in re 9 with slow declines and high nonlinearity were better predicted with the ks and f derived from re 1 which showed slow stable decline rates due to lower hydraulic diffusivity conditions between the stream aquifer for mid range log a and b we also identified that the effective parameters ks and f demonstrate better performance when used to predict the nsd fluxes of similar recession characteristics fig 10 while these results validate the proposed parameterization scheme s applicability the performance differences also emphasize that the effective aquifer properties and thus the stream hillslope hydraulic diffusivity should be estimated differently according to each re s recession characteristics 5 discussion limitation and future work the event scale recession analysis has been increasingly recognized as an alternative method to traditional aquifer parameterization using point cloud recession data we demonstrated that the event scale recession analysis is a promising methodology for estimating effective aquifer properties showing that different hydraulic diffusivity between the stream aquifer can be estimated by explicitly accounting for the variability in the recession characteristics through the combined use of the analytical models and the numerical be3s we tried to present one parameterization scheme for explicit calculation of aquifer properties this study therefore relies on the boussinesq flow assumption to interpret catchment scale nsd data since to date the mathematical relationship between the power law recession model and the boussinesq model for aquifer outflow is the only physically explicit method for aquifer parameterization care should therefore be taken in the selection of recession data as individual res with convex slopes i e increasing slope b as recession progresses or too high recession slopes i e higher than 3 0 are not expected to be suitable for aquifer parameterization based on the presented method due to the boussinesq assumption it is also worth noting that the recession slopes in observed individual res across actual watersheds typically increase with time in about 75 i e convex of the total res yielding only around 10 of the res with decreasing slopes over time i e concave tashie et al 2020 overall our effort not to use the boussinesq model to interpret non boussinesq flow was justified by selectively using recession records that satisfy the concavity and nonlinearity criteria from an individual recession record on the other hand the determination of the transition point from early to late time domain can significantly affect the final estimates of effective aquifer parameters due to nonlinear variability of hydraulic diffusivity per unit perimeter i e ks f with changing recession parameter a supplemental information si5 while the presented method for identifying the transition of hydraulic regimes in a recession event is conceptually consistent with previous studies ghosh et al 2016 jachens et al 2020a the method based on cumulative r and mse can still be susceptible to data points especially when multiple dq dt q outliers i e slower decrease in streamflow for a single time step are found in an hourly recession record in addition to the identification method based on the relative behavior of r and mse therefore further studies are needed to reduce the uncertainty associated with deciding the transition between the early and late time regimes for accurate estimation of the recession parameter a consequently this study explained distinct recession behavior across individual res and the time dependent degree of recession nonlinearities over the course of a re based on the functionality between hydraulic diffusivity condition and transient groundwater storage the relevance of the nsd data in event scale recession analysis specifically for effective aquifer parameterization has been argued throughout this article it starts from the efforts to satisfy the basic mathematical structure i e dewatering aquifer during the recession period of recession analysis through the estimation of dini based on the transition of river states i e losing to gaining reach the excellent agreements r2 0 96 between the be3s derived nsd and corresponding observations found in all the individual res demonstrate that the boussinesq aquifer assumption is the valid mathematical framework for aquifer parameterization more importantly to the best of our knowledge this work is the first case that attempts to explicitly estimate the actual contributing aquifer area ac by the ratio of ꭤ for better calibrated catchment scale effective aquifer hydraulic properties the feasibility of the estimated effective parameters has been ensured with catchment scale field nsd observations overall we encourage the use of the nsd data modeled and observed in the effective parameterization of catchment scale aquifer because of its various advantages to infer the states of lateral hydraulic gradients between the stream hillslope as well as the catchment scale channel water balance since our method is based on the boussinesq aquifer assumption the proposed parameterization scheme is expected to perform appropriately in regions where the streams and hillslopes are hydraulically well connected preferably gaining reach than the arid semi arid regions with deep water tables although as intended in this study we successfully presented a methodology for effective groundwater parameterization this study is also limited to drawing the general implications due to the small number of res and the site specific nature for example while we identified the increasing hillslope length b with decreasing b table 2 we cannot identify if this is a generalizable relationship between the contributing hillslope length b and recession characteristics due to the limited size of data the strength of explicit estimation of the catchment scale effective groundwater properties is to understand the role of the groundwater in the hydraulically connected surface subsurface system such as two way stream aquifer hydrologic modeling hong et al 2020 the catchment scale hydrologic similarity analysis lyon and troch 2010 saghafian et al 1995 sawicz et al 2011 and water energy availability on the land surface fan and miguez macho 2010 maxwell and condon 2016 rouholahnejad freund and kirchner 2017 especially for large scale integrated hydrologic models the presented boussinesq approximation based characterization of the catchment scale groundwater can facilitate conceptual clarity i e separate representation of the aquifer and channel and parametric efficiency in depicting the groundwater and its connectivity with the fluvial system thus leading to improved representation of stream hillslope hydrologic continuum fan et al 2019 unlike the methods in the existing models moreover the boussinesq based representation of the stream hillslope continuum considers local horizontal pressure gradient from stream ridge to hilltop as the driver of the stream hillslope two way continuum exchanges therefore future work can be summarized as 1 integrating the be3s into a large scale hydrologic model configuration for improved predictability of hydrologic variables 2 characterizing the catchment hillslope scale continuums based on effective parameters ks f dini and b and their relationships and 3 understanding the effects of the stream hillslope hydraulic diffusivity conditions on horizontal hydrologic convergence divergence e g topographically driven phreatic flow and thus impacting on the surface water energy conditions credit authorship

39,the kinetic interface sensitive kis tracer experiment is a newly developed method to quantify the fluid fluid interfacial area fifa during drainage processes the concentration breakthrough curves obtained by measuring reaction product concentration in brine water samples after breakthrough are interpreted with a specialized numerical model to determine the fifa however this method has its own limitations since the volume of the usable water sample after breakthrough based on which the analysis takes place is often insufficient this happens because this volume strongly depends on the aquifer material i e sand type and system parameters an alternative is to employ kis tracers in a push pull experimental set up i e primary drainage is followed by a consequent main imbibition process with the flow direction being reversed this study applies a pore scale numerical model to study the kis tracer reactive transport during a push pull experiment in a 2d porous medium the advective dispersive reactive transport during both primary drainage and main imbibition processes is discussed the concentration breakthrough curves show a non linear descending trend with time until reaching a constant concentration at the steady state by analyzing the spatial concentration distribution and the concentration breakthrough curve the macro scale kis tracer reactive transport model can be interpreted for the push pull process finally the new method is applied in a column experiment where the determined specific interfacial area is found to be close to literature data keywords reactive

interfacial area fifa is essential for studying two phase flow and interphase mass transfer in porous materials miller et al 1990 hassanizadeh and gray 1990 existing techniques to measure fifa mainly include interfacial partitioning tracer tests iptt brusseau et al 2010 mcdonald et al 2016 x ray computed micro tomography xrct culligan et al 2004 porter et al 2010 and photo luminescent volumetric imaging pvi montemagno and gray 1995 one common limitation of these methods is that they are only feasible for steady state quasi static conditions tatomir et al 2018 a kinetic interface sensitive tracer test kis tt was recently developed for quantifying the fifa in dynamic two phase flow tatomir et al 2016 tatomir et al 2018 the kis tracer method determines the fifa for particular flow conditions induced by the injection of non aqueous phase liquids napls into the aquifer 1 1 background of the kis tracer the kis tracer compound was first synthesized as phenyl naphthalene 2 sulfonate 2 nsaph by schaffer et al 2013 the 2 nsaph is a non polar hydrolysable phenolic ester which dissolves in non polar liquids or napls when the napl with dissolved kis tracer interacts with the resident water phase the tracer molecules are being adsorbed onto the fluid fluid interface following langmuir s isotherm schaffer et al 2013 at the fluid fluid interface the adsorbed 2 nsaph molecules undergo an irreversible hydrolysis reaction 1 due to the excess supply of tracer i e its concentration at the interface stays constant at its maximum value the original first order hydrolysis reaction can be simplified to a pseudo zero order reaction schaffer et al 2013 expressed by 2 a w n m k r c δ t where rc kg s 1m 2 is the reaction rate of the kis tracer per unit interfacial area mk kg is the mass of the reaction product k δt is the reaction time and awn is the fifa m2 among the two reaction products naphthalene 2 sulfonate acid and phenol the naphthalene 2 sulfonate acid 2 nsa is the compound more easily measured in a tracer experiment because of its intrinsic fluorescent properties schaffer et al 2013 tatomir et al 2018 with the 2 nsa characterized by high polarity being highly hydrophilic and non adsorptive on either the water solid interface or the fluid fluid interfaces it can be expected to disperse rapidly into the bulk water at distance from the fluid fluid interface schaffer et al 2013 tatomir et al 2018 thus in a kis tracer experiment we measure the 2 nsa concentration in water and the obtained reacted 2 nsa mass mk can be used to calculate the interfacial area according to eq 2 with a constant zero order reaction at the interface the study of the 2 nsaph decay and transport in the napl becomes redundant and the most relevant component of study is the reaction product 2 nsa which is present only in the aqueous phase due to the working mechanism of the kis tt explained above the kis tt is mainly designed for field applications where a napl is necessary to be injected into the aquifer e g geological storage of supercritical carbon dioxide the migration of the co2 plume the capillary trapping of co2 and the dissolution of co2 into the brine are all relevant to the fifa which can be tracked by employing the kis tracer during the co2 injection besides the kis tt can also be applied to estimate the fifa during infiltration of napl contaminants into the aquifer by running a laboratory kis tt with a portion of uncontaminated medium excavated from the site at the approximate flow conditions from the contaminated sites the fifa can be classified into film associated fifa capillary associated fifa which can be further subdivided into a mobile part and an immobile part tatomir et al 2018 first applied the kis tracer in drainage experiments in a column to measure the capillary associated fifa and thus the method is here termed drainage kis tracer method for dynamic conditions in the work of tatomir et al 2018 the kis tracer was dissolved in n octane napl to drain the initially water saturated column the porous media was well characterized in terms of grain size porosity and permeability of the glass beads packing at the column outlet samples were collected and measured at defined time intervals and plotted as btcs of 2 nsa concentration and cumulative pore volumes of the fluids the experimental data was analyzed by employing a macro scale two phase flow reactive transport model with the interfacial reaction of the tracer being specified in the zones where two fluids coexist tatomir et al 2015 tatomir et al 2019 the resulting maximum specific fifa was determined at between 500 and 540 m 1 for glass beads with a mean diameter of 248 μm furthermore applying a pore scale direct numerical simulation method gao et al 2021a studied the effect of hydrodynamically stagnant zones on the drainage kis tracer method in a conceptual 2d porous medium by analyzing the quantified interfacial area and reacted solute mass in the flowing and stagnant zones gao et al 2021a proposed that the 2 nsa mass in the flowing water is mainly produced by the reaction taking place at the moving menisci and a fraction of solute mass produced by the moving menisci can be retained in the newly formed stagnant zones during displacement this realization made it clear that there is a portion of the interfacial area related to the stagnant zones which cannot be accounted for they concluded that the drainage kis tracer method measures that fraction of fifa with a common boundary to the mobile water gao et al 2021b further consider the condition of variable surface roughness of the mineral grains in order to determine any potential losses related to surface roughness they found that a mobile mass retention term needs only to be considered when the root mean square roughness is larger than 3 μm concluding that the drainage kis tracer method is also feasible for the determination of the mobile fifa when the grain surface is reasonably rough e g natural soils 1 2 a novel push pull kis tracer method despite the promising results in the previous studies the drainage kis tracer method has two major limitations first the volume of usable effluent water sample containing the reacted tracer is often insufficient in the column experiments the 2 nsa concentration measured at the outlet is zero at early times before breakthrough arrival of n octane front at the outlet and starts to increase only after first arrival of the tracer which implies that usable data can only be obtained from a water sample retrieved after first arrival of the tracer tatomir et al 2018 when in the effluent the volume fraction of water at the outlet sharply changes from one to zero hardly any water samples with the reacted tracer can be retrieved because of insufficient water volume being discharged the discharged water volume after first arrival of the tracer is dependent on the grain sizes and sand types by conducting column experiments with unconsolidated porous media composed either of glass beads or natural soils of variable grain size it was found that the drainage kis tracer method is only applicable for fine sands mostly of mean diameter smaller than 250 μm and the water sample volumes collected during the experiments using natural soils generally are smaller than those composed of glass beads tatomir et al 2022 the volume of the available water sample after breakthrough also depends on system parameters capillary number fluid viscosity etc a stable displacement without fingering front pattern may lead to only small volumes of water discharged after breakthrough this is also relevant when field scale applications of the drainage kis tracer method in natural aquifers are being planned since natural aquifers generally exhibit a wide spectrum of sedimentary architectural elements clay lenses gravel lenses of different geometric and hydraulic properties including variable grain size grain textures and system parameters the second limitation of the drainage kis tracer method is that the reacted 2 nsa mass observable in the effluent is only relevant to the mobile fifa at the front gao et al 2021a and the magnitude of the total specific fifa cannot be measured the information about the fifa associated with capillary trapping in the hydrodynamically stagnant zones is missing to overcome the above limitations we propose a novel push pull kis tracer method fig 1 the kis tracer is dissolved in a finite volume of napl and injected into the water saturated aquifer push phase then instead of monitoring the effluent concentration at another port well fluids are abstracted at the inlet after start of the pull phase immediately after the primary drainage process and the porous material undergoes an imbibition process with reversed flow direction the effluent mainly composed of mobile napl at beginning followed by the discharged water which can be sampled to measure the 2 nsa concentration btcs in this case the volume of water available for the measurement of the reaction product acid 2 nsa concentration is no longer limited by the type of sand or an unstable displacement in the imbibition process as water becomes the continuous flowing phase both 2 nsa mass reacted at the water napl front as well as in the capillary trapped water can both expected to be transported and measured and thus the total mobile and immobile fifa can be measured besides the push pull kis tracer method requires only one single well for experimental operations and thus it is more economical for field application especially for deep aquifers the push pull tests do not require such extended operation times compared to those of a napl plume travelling between injection and to a monitoring well and thus the push pull kis tracer method can be conducted much faster furthermore the push pull tests have widely been used along with various types of tracers in the study of e g residual napl saturation tomich et al 1973 davis et al 2002 istok et al 2002 microbial activities istok et al 1997 urmann et al 2005 methane oxidation gómez et al 2008 solute sorption to aquifer sediments istok et al 1999 schroth et al 2000 assessment of the effective heat exchange surface area in geothermal applications ghergut et al 2013 etc to the authors knowledge a tracer push pull experiment has not yet been applied for the determination of the fifa for dynamic conditions 1 3 pore scale direct numerical simulation pore scale study approaches i e image based experiments using transparent microfluidic devices or direction numerical simulations play important roles in understanding the pore scale phenomena and can provide fundamental insights to understand the macro scale processes meakin and tartakovsky 2009 for example the transient two phase flow and the dynamics of the interfacial area are directly resolved at the pore scale in experiments by karadimitriou et al 2014 and godinez brizuela et al 2017 using micro models with pore networks representing two dimensional porous media with the development of computers and numerical tools direct numerical simulation of two phase flow and reactive transport at the pore scale by applying computational fluid dynamics cfd methods has become available in a previous work a pore scale based numerical approach for the kis tracer was built with the phase field method pfm by gao et al 2021a the pfm is outstanding for simulations of the kis tracer reactive transport compared to other widely applied two phase flow reactive transport models e g lattice boltzmann method volume of fluid method level set method etc because the interface is resolved as a thin diffusive layer formed by the mixture of two fluids according to thermodynamic principles thus the zero order reaction of the kis tracer at fluid fluid interface can be directly implemented as a homogenous bulk reaction in the region of the diffusive interface at the pore scale the transport of reacted 2 nsa involves several important mechanisms including advection molecular diffusion partitioning distribution between the two fluid phase as well as the zero order reaction at the interface all these mechanisms are simulated with a continuous solute transport cst formulation derived in the pfm framework by gao et al 2021a and the pfm cst model is verified with analytical solutions of advective diffusion reactive diffusion and interphase mass transfer processes 1 4 objectives here we employ the pfm cst model to simulate a push pull kis tracer experiment in a conceptual 2d porous medium this study aims at 1 providing a pore scale insight into reactive transport of the interfacially reactive and water dissolved tracer during primary drainage and main imbibition at 2 validating the macro scale numerical model used to interpret the btcs obtained from push pull kis tracer experiments and at 3 proving the concept of push pull kis tracer method through a column experiment the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the theory of the mathematical and the numerical models employed the details of the model setup for the pore scale numerical experiment as well as the macro scale reactive transport numerical model are outlined in section 3 the application of the new method to column experiments is elaborated in section 4 the results and discussions are demonstrated in section 5 finally section 6 lists the main conclusions and findings 2 mathematic model 2 1 phase field method the theory of the pfm is described in detail in e g jacqmin 1999 badalassi et al 2003 yue et al 2004 alpak et al 2016 in this chapter we briefly review the equations implemented in the two phase flow model the pfm treats the interface as a thin diffusive layer formed by a mixture of two fluids and a smoothly changing phase variable ϕ varying between 1 and 1 is introduced to describe the composition of the fluid mixture a fundamental concept of the pfm is that free energy density can be expressed as a function of the phase variable and its gradient jacqmin 1999 the free energy density fmix j m3 for an isothermal mixing of two fluids can be expressed in the ginzburg landau form yue et al 2006 3 f m i x ϕ ϕ 1 2 λ ϕ 2 λ 4 ε 2 ϕ 2 1 2 where λ n is the magnitude of the mixing energy and ε m is the capillary thickness which determines the thickness of the diffusive interface at equilibrium yue et al 2004 the first term on the right side of the above equation accounts for the surface energy and the second term accounts for the bulk energy which has two minima corresponding to the two stable phases of fluids basirat et al 2017 the chemical potential g j m3 can be defined as the variation of free energy with respect to the dimensionless phase variable 4 g δ ω f m i x d x δ ϕ λ 2 ϕ λ ε 2 ϕ ϕ 2 1 where ω is the region of space occupied by the fluids the interfacial tension σ n m is the total free energy at the interface per unit interfacial area which is related to the capillary thickness and the mixing energy density through eq 5 yue et al 2004 5 σ 2 2 λ 3 ε fluid mass conservation is governed by the cahn hilliard equation eq 6 which assumes that the diffusive fluid flux is proportional to the gradient of the chemical potential cahn and hilliard 1959 6 ϕ t u ϕ γ g where u is the fluid velocity vector and γ m3s kg is the mobility which governs the intensity of the diffusive fluid flux and the relaxation time of the interface akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2013 the mobility γ needs to be large enough to maintain a constant thickness of the interface but small enough not to suppress the flow jacqmin 1999 the mobility γ is generally expressed as a function of the capillary thickness and a tuning factor introduced as γ χε2 the tuning factor χ m s kg is denoted as the characteristic mobility 2 2 two phase flow dynamics momentum conservation is governed by the navier stokes equations for incompressible fluids eq 7 where interfacial tension is considered as a body force following the concept of the pfm approach 7 ρ u t u u p i μ u u t g ϕ 8 u 0 where i is the second order identity tensor p is pressure and ρ and μ are respectively the density and viscosity of the mixture non wetting and wetting fluid according to the volume fraction of the fluids vf α α w nw 9 v f w 1 ϕ 2 and v f n w 1 ϕ 2 and 10 ρ ρ w v f w ρ n w v f n w and μ μ w v f w μ n w v f n w where subscripts w and nw indicate wetting and non wetting phase respectively the incompressible formalism of the navier stokes equations can applied for the mixture condition at the interface as long as the interface thickness is small enough so that the results remain unaffected lowengrub and truskinovsky 1998 zhou et al 2010 at the grain surfaces a no slip boundary condition is applied with u 0 in eq 7 for solid wall boundaries the wetting condition on the solid wall is expressed by 11 n ϕ cos θ w ϕ where n is the outward normal vector to the wall and θ w is the contact angle 2 3 reactive transport the reactive transport model based on the phase field method was developed in gao et al 2021a the model considers kis tracer transport mechanisms including advection molecular diffusion partitioning between two immiscible fluids and reaction at the interface here we briefly review the major components of the reactive transport model for a solute k dissolved in a fluid phase α of mass concentration c a k the solute mass conservation equation writes as gao et al 2021a 12 v f w c w k t u v f w c w k 0 5 γ g c w k 0 v f n w c n w k t u v f n w c n w k 0 5 γ g c n w k 0 where only solute advection due to the bulk fluid motion is included the local thermodynamic equilibrium of the solute in a two phase system is described by a partitioning coefficient pow k defined as the concentration ratio of the solute in each phase at equilibrium condition 13 p o w k c n w k c w k where cnw k and cw k are the concentrations of the product 2 nsa in the non wetting phase and the wetting phase respectively and pow k is the partition coefficient to obtain the single field formulation of the 2 nsa concentration for both phases in the entire domain the global concentration is defined as 14 c k v f w c w k v f n w c n w k the solute diffusion flux for the mixture is defined as haroun et al 2010 15 j k d k v f w c w k v f n w c n w k d k c k c w k c n w k v f w as vf w vf nw 1 here only vf w is used in the expression and dk is the effective dispersion coefficient the diffusion term eq 15 indicates an additional flux term derived from the solubility law this solubility flux is in normal direction to the interface which governs the distribution of the species between the two phases thus by incorporating the equations from eq 12 to eq 15 and adding the source term for the chemical reaction the final governing equation for the global concentration of solute k is reorganized c k t u c k 0 5 γ g c k 1 p ow k v f w p ow k 1 v f w 16 d k c k v f w c k 1 p ow k v f w p ow k 1 v f w r c dif 0 where r c d i f kg s 1m 3 is the zero order interfacial reaction of the kis tracer which is assumed in the model as a homogeneous reaction taking place at the diffusive interface the interfacial reaction region is taken with vf w 0 05 0 95 whose thickness is bwn 4 1641ε yue et al 2004 with the constant interface thickness the reaction rate per unit interfacial region for the model can be calculated as 17 r c d i f r c b w n v f w 0 05 0 95 0 v f w 0 0 05 0 95 1 where rc kg s 1m 2 is the tracer reaction rate per unit sharp interfacial area 3 numerical model the numerical implementation is explained in section 3 1 the details of the pore scale numerical simulation setup are shown in section 3 2 the data treatment to obtain the concentration breakthrough curve and volume averaged parameters inside the domain are shown in section 3 3 3 1 numerical implementation the model is implemented in comsol multiphysics a software for solving of partial differential equations employing the finite element method for spatial discretization tatomir et al 2018 gao et al 2022 the linear solver pardiso is used to solve the set of partial differential equations the implicit backward euler method is used to solve the time stepping the initial time step and maximum time steps are controlled to be small enough in order to avoid singularities the mesh is generated in comsol with triangular elements the advancing front algorithm is applied for the tessellation gao et al 2021b most of the mesh elements are controlled to be regular triangles with a side length of h the computations were performed on a single cpu with 8 cores operating at 4 3 ghz and a memory of 128 gb ram 3 2 pore scale numerical experiment setups the study domain is assumed as a two dimensional rectangle measuring in total 14 72 mm 3 53 mm length width including two rectangles as inlets for the fluids on both sides of a porous domain in between measuring 14 53 mm 3 53 mm in size as shown in fig 2 a the 2d domain is assumed to be horizontal so that the gravity is neglected the pore space is shaped by circular grains which have been widely used in micro fluidic experiments and pore scale numerical studies ferrari and lunati 2013 liu et al 2014 godinez brizuela et al 2017 each grain bears a size randomly chosen from three potential choices with diameters of 225 μm 250 μm or 275 μm which are similar to the size of the glass beads used for column experiment in section 4 the grains are first uniformly distributed to fill the domain explained in fig 2 b then each grain is moved from its original place in both x and y directions the distances of the movement in both directions are randomly determined but controlled to be shorter than 20 μm and the grains do not overlap the porous medium is built at a porosity of 47 56 the domain is discretized with triangular elements most of which have a side length of h 8 10 6 m and two layers of mesh on the solid wall are further refined with a thickness of h 2 10 6 m to better resolve the flow condition near the solid wall as shown in fig 2 c the capillary thickness for the model is set at ε 1 10 5 m so that the interface is resolved with adequate meshes gao et al 2021a the relevant physical properties of the non wetting fluid n octane are its density ρnw 703 kg m3 and viscosity μnw 0 54 10 3 pa s the interfacial tension between n octane and water is σ 0 0504 n m tatomir et al 2018 the porous medium is water wet with a contact angle between the two phases being θ w 45 the simulation is carried out for a drainage process followed by an imbibition process during drainage the porous domain is initially filled with water and the inlet on the left hand side is initially filled with n octane with the tracer dissolved the initial location of the interface is determined red dashed line in fig 2 necessary to ascertain numerical stability at t 0 the n octane with the tracer dissolved in it is injected at the left boundary to displace the water at a constant velocity or specific flux of uin 0 025 m s and the right hand side of the domain is the outlet with pressure equal to zero the inflow rate is within the range given in the pore scale study of geological storage of co2 by basirat et al 2017 the inflow rate is chosen to be large enough for the entrance of the non wetting phase into the domain meanwhile the flow is ensured to be laminar gao et al 2021a the reynolds number associated with the displacement can be calculated as re uin ρ lc μnw the averaged width of the throat in the porous media lc 0 062 mm estimated from distances between centers of the circular grains and thus the reynolds number is re 2 which indicates the flow regime is laminar the capillary number for the system is calculated as ca uin μnw σ thus the capillary number is obtained as ca 2 5 10 4 with a viscosity ratio μnw μw of 0 5 the displacement process is considered as a transition regime between a stable displacement and a fingering displacement regime according to the diagram given by lenormand et al 1988 drainage period lasts for 0 15 s and this duration time is chosen such that the front does not arrive the outlet then imbibition begins at t 0 15 s as initial conditions for the simulation of the imbibition process simulated state variables of the last time step of the drainage period are specified during imbibition water is injected at the right boundary to displace the n octane at a constant velocity or specific flux of uin 0 05 m s the imbibition lasts until an equilibrium acid 2 nsa concentration in the domain is obtained in both drainage and imbibition the upper and lower sides of the domain are symmetry free slip and no flow boundaries the characteristic mobility is χ 25 m s kg for the drainage and χ 50 m s kg for the imbibition large enough to maintain the constant thickness of the interface during the simulation gao et al 2021a the initial 2 nsa concentration in the domain is zero and the 2 nsa is only produced by the interfacial reaction following the theory of the kis tracer the zero order reaction rate is assumed to be r c d i f 1 kg m 3 s 1 the partitioning coefficient is set at pow 0 01 therefore the partitioning of the 2 nsa into the n octane is negligible gao et al 2021a the transport of the produced 2 nsa can occur in an advection dominated regime a diffusion dominated regime or a transition regime in between gao et al 2021a the transport regime is dependent on the ratio of advective to diffusive transport rates described by the péclet number pe uin lc dk up to now the application of the kis tracer in laboratory column experiments e g by tatomir et al 2018 2022 are mainly conducted at pe ranging from 1 to 10 thus the pore scale modeling here also aims at investigating the transport of 2 nsa for pe within this range with the chosen inflow velocity and characteristic length as explained in the last paragraph the effective dispersion coefficient of the solute is assumed to be dk 1 10 6 m2 s resulting in the péclet numbers of pe 1 55 and pe 3 1 for drainage and imbibition respectively the 2 nsa concentration breakthrough curve is obtained at the measurement line on the left hand side of the domain at the same location as the initial interface was initially positioned plotted with red dashed line in fig 2 the 2 nsa concentration distribution in the domain is monitored in seven representative element volume rev domains along the longitudinal direction labelled as rev 1 7 in fig 2 a each rev measures 3 6325 mm 3 53 mm in size the porosity within randomly distributed frames with sizes range from 0 2 to 12 8 mm2 inside the porous medium are analyzed as shown in fig 2 d the results show that the calculated porosity becomes stable at approximately 47 56 with regard to the domain size close to 12 8 mm2 and this indicates the chosen rev is reasonable 3 3 pore scale data treatment the 2 nsa concentration c w b t c passing through the measurement line control plane can be obtained by dividing the 2 nsa mass flowrate mbtc with the water volume flowrate uw btc that is passing through the measurement line 18 c w b t c m b t c u w b t c the 2 nsa mass flux that passing through the measurement line can be obtained with 19 m b t c l m u n c k d l where un is the magnitude of the velocity normal to the outlet and lm is the measurement line the volume of water flow that is passing through the measurement line can be obtained with 20 u w b t c l m u n δ w d l where δ w is the function indicating the aqueous phase 21 δ w 1 f o r v f w 0 5 1 δ w 0 f o r v f w 0 0 5 besides the macro scale parameters in the domain e g water saturation specific interfacial area macro scale 2 nsa concentration over the revs can be obtained from the pore scale simulation results the diffusive interfacial area a w n d i f in the domain and the corresponding sharp interfacial area awn can be calculated with 22 a w n d i f v v δ i f a d v and a w n a w n d i f b w n where vv is the void space in the porous domain δ ifa is the function indicating the diffusive

interfacial area in the rev domains can be obtained as 24 a w n a w n v p where vp is the bulk volume of the porous medium the water saturation in the rev domain can be obtained as 25 s w v v δ w d v v v the averaged 2 nsa concentration in the rev domain can be calculated as 26 c w v v c k d v v v δ w d v 3 4 continuum scale numerical modeling the breakthrough curve obtained from a push pull kis tracer experiment needs to be interpreted using a macro scale reactive transport model to obtain the measured fifa in this research the macro scale reactive transport model is validated for the push pull process by applying it to a single one dimensional simulation in the longitudinal direction with the same setup as the pore scale study the model section 3 2 is set up at the pore scale in two dimensions and in one dimension at the macro scale the reactive transport model of the kis tracer transport in the immiscible drainage process was demonstrated in tatomir et al 2018 where transport of the acid is described by an advection dispersion reaction equation 27 φ s w c w t c w u w d d i s c w r c a w n 0 where φ is the porosity φ vv vp uw is the macro scale water phase velocity ddis is the dispersion coefficient and cw is the macro scale 2 nsa concentration water saturation sw in the reactive transport model is obtained from the macro scale two phase flow model in tatomir et al 2018 where the extended darcy s law for two phase flow was applied this requires knowing of the petrophysical properties of the porous media i e the capillary pressure saturation relation functions and relative permeabilities of both phases for push pull processes which need to be determined with complicated processes whereas the macro scale two phase flow model is not required here for the numerical experiment at pore scale since the saturation in the region drained or flooded behind the moving front remains almost unchanged spatially the saturation distribution can be explicitly represented by step functions based on the pore scale simulation results with the constant front advancing velocity in push and pull processes u f d and u f i assuming the one dimension domain at 0 x xmax mm with the inlet at x 0 and td for the total time of drainage process the location of the front can be directly calculated with u f d t for primary drainage and u f d t d u f i t t d for main imbibition the water saturation during the drainage push stage is defined as 28 s w s w d f o r x u f d t s w 1 f o r x u f d t and the water saturation during the imbibition pull stage is defined as

the push pull kis tracer method is applied to column experiments the materials and experimental setup are demonstrated in section 4 1 and the experimental procedure is explained in section 4 2 4 1 materials and setup the setup of the column experiment is demonstrated in fig 2 a the stainless steel column is positioned vertically with a length of 30 cm and a diameter of 3 cm both ends of the column are sealed by two stainless steel caps embedded with a porous frit which create a uniform distribution of fluids entering leaving the column and retain the glass beads in the column both tubes on the two caps are connected to 3 2 way valves and each tube leads to either a peristaltic pump connecting to a fluid tank or an outlet with effluent collected with a measuring cylinder the n octane dissolved with kis tracer tank is connected to the top of the column and the water tank is connected to the bottom of the column the column is packed with glass beads with a mean diameter of 248 μm the glass beads have an average roundness of 0 983 and a neglectable surface roughness as shown in fig 2 b the grain size distribution of the glass beads is shown in fig 2 c the grain roundness and size distribution is measured from the microscopic images of more than 200 randomly selected beads the unconsolidated porous medium has a porosity of 38 39 and an intrinsic permeability at 8 10 12 m2 1 10 11 m2 measured by tatomir et al 2018 furthermore the deionized water is used as the wetting phase fluid and the n octane is used as the non wetting phase fluid the main properties of the fluids have been given in section 3 1 the kis tracer is dissolved in n octane at a concentration of 0 1 g l and the hydrolysis reaction rate of the tracer is determined as rc 1 18 10 12 kg m 2 s 1 tatomir et al 2018 fig 3 4 2 experimental procedure prior to the experiment the column is first packed with the dry glass beads the packing is done in small increments while vibrating the column to ensure a homogeneous medium to prepare a water saturated column the de ionized water is injected from bottom of the column to slowly displace the air inside the column and the top of column is connected to the outlet the total pore space is determined from the injected water volume as 82 ml after the column is saturated with water water flushing will continue for 24 h to ensure that the sand is clean no residual pollutants from previous experiments and a constant background fluorescence signal can be determined in the effluent the experiment begins by injection of 30 ml n octane kis tracer dissolved at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min from top of the column with the bottom of column connecting to the outlet the capillary number is obtained as ca 1 18 10 7 with a viscosity ratio μnw μw of 0 5 the displacement process is considered as a transition regime close to a capillary fingering displacement one the n octane injection drainage process last for 1 hour the front of the n octane is ensured not to arrive the bottom of the column because about 55 ml n octane is necessary for a breakthrough determined from previous study by tatomir et al 2018 then by switching the valve the water is injected at a flow rate of 1 ml min from bottom of the column with the top of column as the outlet at the beginning of the imbibition there is only n octane coming out from the column the total effluent n octane volume is about 18 ml with observation of the first water bubble in cylinder at outlet the water sample will be collected by 5 ml measuring cylinders and transferred for concentration measurement in the fluorospectrometer cary eclipse fluorospectrometer from varian each water sample volume is larger than 1 ml to ensure an accurate fluorescent measurement the time the water sample volume and acid concentration are always recorded during the experiment to obtain the resulting tracer breakthrough curve the measurement last until the decreasing of the acid concentration in water samples are very small about 1 5 hour of imbibition meaning the approaching of a steady state after each experiment the glass beads were washed and dried over 48 h the measured acid concentration is pretreated by deducting the background fluorescence signal to obtain the final experiment data in total three experiments are done in the same way triplicate to ensure the reproducibility 5 results and discussion in section 5 1 we present the pore scale concentration distribution patterns during the push pull process and compare to the macro scale reactive transport model in section 5 2 the corresponding concentration btcs are shown and their interpretation is being discussed in section 5 3 the new push pull kis tracer method is applied in the column experiment 5 1 concentration distributions from the pore scale simulation the spatial concentration distribution at t 0 07 s t 0 15 s t 0 18 s t 0 21 s t 0 24 s t 0 32 s during the push pull process is illustrated in fig 4 a together with the corresponding average 2 nsa concentration over the revs in fig 4 b during the primary drainage push phase t 0 07 s t 0 15 s in fig 4a the receding water is partially entrapped by the invading n octane forming the trapped water clusters the local concentration of the reacted acid 2 nsa in these trapped water clusters pockets largely differ among each other depending on the size of the associated interface and the volume of the water cluster the water clusters with a smaller volume generally show much higher local 2 nsa concentrations the reacted acid in the water clusters is not mixed with each other because the water clusters are isolated from each other by the invading napl phase during drainage the effects of advective and dispersive transport of the reacted acid is minor only noticeable at the moving front where the reacted acid mass is low and negligible compared to that in trapped water clusters the weak dispersion was also observed in the previous column drainage experiments reported by tatomir et al 2018 average concentration monitored in the revs for primary drainage is plotted in fig 4b t 0 07 s and t 0 15 s it can be observed that during the push stage average concentration in the domain linearly decreases in flow direction with its maximum being near the inlet this is because near the inlet the two fluids remain in contact with each other for longer which means that tracer accumulates in the water clusters as a consequence of the reaction across the fluid fluid interface the spatial 2 nsa concentration distribution during main imbibition pull phase is shown in fig 4 a at t 0 18 s t 0 21 s the invading water pushes the napl front back with mobile napl flowing towards the outlet left boundary and the immobile napl being trapped in the domain residual trapping with the front being pushed back during main imbibition the trapped water clusters are released and connected again with the flowing bulk water in the meantime the reacted acid present in these water clusters is released and mixed with the flowing water the acid dissolved and mixed in the flowing water is subjected to advective dispersive diffusive transport during main imbibition which leads to a non linearly decreasing concentration gradient in longitudinal direction as shown in fig 4 b at t 0 18 s t 0 21 s the main processes facilitating mixing of acid with fresh water in the flooded region are mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion when the wetting phase front arrives at the inlet left boundary at t 0 21 s the effluent changes from napl to water and the tracer breakthrough commences as main imbibition pull stage proceeds the 2 nsa concentration and phase distribution patterns approach steady state shown in fig 4 a for t 0 24 s and t 0 32 s the kis tracer dissolved in the residual napl i e trapped napl clusters in the domain continues to react at the interface with the flowing water and the generated acid mass is further transported towards the left boundary and the measurement control reference line when the system approaches steady state a constant effluent acid concentration can be obtained resulting from the reaction at the interfaces associated with the residual napl the average 2 nsa concentration in the porous domain almost linearly decreases in longitudinal direction as shown in fig 4b t 0 32 s then the macro scale reactive transport model is compared it to pore scale simulation results as shown in fig 4 b the concentration distribution of the macro scale reactive transport model blue dashed lines match very well with the pore scale simulation results red dots in the push pull process the root mean square errors rmse range from 0 0006 to 0 0024 kg m3 the dispersion coefficient applied for the simulation of main imbibition d d i s i 1 10 5 m2 s is two orders of magnitude larger than that for the primary drainage phase d d i s d 1 10 7 m2 s this observation of significant differences between the dispersion coefficients from primary drainage and main imbibition matches the results from the experimental study by chen et al 2021 applying xrct characterization furthermore the accuracy of explicit expression of two phase flow is tested by comparing it to the average sw and awn obtained from the revs at t 0 07 s t 0 15 s for primary drainage and t 0 18 s t 0 24 s for main imbibition as shown in fig 5 it is observed that with s w d 0 376 s w i 0 906 a w n d 976 1 m a w n i 340 1 m the macro scale explicit expression dashed line in fig 5 can generally approximate the pore scale simulated two phase flow during primary drainage sw and awn in the drained region are more or less spatially invariable and thus the explicit expression using the step functions matches the pore scale simulation of saturation and interfacial area with rmse up to 0 047 for the saturation and 67 1 m for the specific interfacial area however during main imbibition sw in the flooded region shows slightly increasing trends toward the right which causes a small deviation with rmse up to 0 085 shown in fig 5 at t 0 18 s and t 0 24 s thus the predicted awn during main imbibition also has slightly larger deviations with rmse up to 223 1 m it is worth noting that the explicit expression assuming a sharp and stable front approximates the pore scale simulation very well reason being that because the porous domain is small in extent macroscopically it can be considered as highly homogeneous 5 2 interpretation of the breakthrough curve after calibrating the two phase flow saturation distribution and specific interfacial area to the pore scale numerical experiment the 2 nsa concentration breakthrough curves obtained from the pore scale simulations dotted line and the macro scale reactive transport model continuous line are shown in fig 6 a it can be seen that the macro scale reactive transport model matches the concentration breakthrough curve of the pore scale numerical experiment well with rmse 0 0012 kg m3 the effluent 2 nsa concentration decreases non linearly with time and the rate of decrease in concentration slows down with time the tailing concentration is asymptotically reaching a plateau when the system approaches a steady state in a push pull kis tracer experiment the dispersion coefficient and the specific interfacial area need to be obtained by fitting the concentration btcs of the experiment and the macro scale reactive transport model thus it is necessary to understand how these two parameters awn and ddis affect the concentration btcs by a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is performed by systematically changing one parameter at a time using the calibrated macro scale model of section 5 1 while keeping all other parameters constant the specific interfacial area for primary drainage a w n d is swapped and plotted in fig 6 b peak concentration at early times of breakthrough significantly changes with respect to different a w n d values this is because the concentration peak is mainly controlled by 2 nsa released from trapped water clusters where the reaction rate is determined by the interfacial area created in the drained region during primary drainage the 2 nsa released from trapped water clusters accumulates in the retracting water during the pull stage and this leads to the peak of concentration right after the breakthrough because all drained regions are flooded after breakthrough during main imbibition a w n d no longer affects the concentration btcs at steady state the interfacial area in main imbibition a w n i is also systematically varied and plotted in fig 6 c it can be observed that the steady state tailing 2 nsa concentration varies with different a w n i values at steady state the cumulative volume of the napl clusters and the fluid fluid interfaces do not change resulting in a constant production rate of the reacted tracer in the whole porous domain the 2 nsa production at steady state strongly depends on the magnitude of the interfacial area in contact with the residual napl phase formed during main imbibition furthermore fig 6 d shows results of the sensitivity analysis with respect to the dispersion coefficient during main imbibition d d i s i it can be observed that a change in dispersion coefficient changes the shape of the btc i e for higher dispersion coefficients the decrease in concentration takes longer for steady state concentration to be reached and the peak concentration is lower the time for the btcs to reach steady state concentration only depends on the dispersion coefficient and it is not affected by the magnitude of the specific interfacial area the results imply that by matching the macro scale model breakthrough and the corresponding btcs obtained from a push pull kis tracer experiment the three parameters i e d d i s i a w n d and a w n i can be determined in sequence a sole best fit value for each parameter can be found independently first the dispersion coefficient can directly be determined from the time it takes for the btcs to approach tailing concentration plateau this time not affected by a w n d and a w n i then the specific interfacial areas created during primary drainage and main imbibition can be determined from the magnitudes of the peak concentration and tailing concentration from the btcs respectively 5 3 application to column experiments finally the concept of the push pull kis tracer method is proved through the column experiment the concentration breakthrough curves from three triplicate experiments are obtained and plotted in fig 7 a the three triplicate experiments fit each other well which proves the reproducibility of the experiment each experiment has about 17 usable data points after breakthrough and before the steady state and each water sample has volume of 2 5 ml depending on the time interval this implies that the limitation of few usable water samples in the previous drainage kis tracer experiments is overcame by the push pull setting with the sufficient sample volume the shapes of the btcs can be more accurately determined to measure the fifa the data need to be interpreted by matching to the macro scale reactive transport model eq 27 where two phase flow condition is first determined the saturation distribution in the column experiment is again approximated with the step functions described in section 3 4 and a sharp front is assumed this is reasonable because it is observed from the top of column during the pull stage that the effluent turning from n octane 100 to water 100 when the first water bubble is observed this fast change may result from a sharp front another reason could be that the sphere glass beads used are well sorted with quite uniform grain sizes around 250 μm from the previous drainage experiment by tatomir et al 2018 it is known that about 55 ml n octane is used to drain the full column as the total pore space is 82 ml the s w d 0 33 is calculated with injection of 30 ml n octane in one hour the maximum distance of the front travelled during drainage can be calculated as 16 4 cm and front velocity u f d 4 545 10 5 m s is calculated as 18 ml n octane is recovered during main imbibition s w i 0 73 can be calculated for the flooded region with the observation time for effluent turning from n octane to water t 4680 s the front velocity can be calculated u f d 1 515 10 4 m s then it is found that with the dispersion coefficient d d i s i 8 10 7 m2 s the specific interfacial area a w n d 240 1 m and a w n i 110 1 m the btc predicted from the macro scale reactive transport model eq 27 can well fit the experimental data with a minimum rmse 0 24 μg l as shown in solid line in fig 7 a furthermore the confidence interval is investigated to show the tolerance and the uncertainties in the measurements the confidence interval is obtained by perturbing the best fit parameters i e d d i s i a w n d and a w n i within certain ranges where the resulting sets of btcs from the simulations with a sweep of the three parameters in the ranges can capture most experiment data points a 98 confidence interval is found with ranges of parameters d d i s i 7 10 7 9 10 7 m2 s a w n d 210 265 1 m and a w n i 72 155 1 m as outlined in dashed lines in fig 7 a and fig 7 b the obtained average specific interfacial areas for primary drainage and main imbibition are consistent with the results from culligan et al 2004 and slightly smaller than that from porter et al 2010 where the fifa is measured with xrct as shown in fig 7 b the measured fifa is also within the range predicted with the kis tracer experiment in the previous work of tatomir et al 2022 for primary drainage additionally the results imply that the push pull kis tracer is not sensitive to water films adsorbed on grain surfaces since the fifa measured is much smaller than that predicted from iptt tracer methods with film associated fifa included e g work by brusseau et al 2009 brusseau et al 2010 and mcdonald et al 2016 because the water films have thicknesses of only few molecules the small mass could make it deplete fast with the hydrolysis reaction to the tracer thus the water films contribute very little in the experiment it worth noting that the capillary condensed water for the grains with rough surfaces is not relevant for this study because the glass beads applied here have smooth surfaces 6 summary and conclusions kis tracer reactive transport was studied by pore scale simulations conducted employing the pfm cst model for a 2d porous medium push pull experiment in order to investigate whether the pore scale processes can be simulated in a large scale continuum modeling approach and in how far important parameter such as interfacial area awn and dispersion coefficient ddis can independently be obtained from the experimental breakthrough signal the ability of the new push pull kis tracer method for determination of the fifa was demonstrated in the column experiment the major results and findings of the study are listed below the advective and dispersive transport of the tracer is very weak during primary drainage but becomes more prominent during main imbibition the dispersion coefficient for main imbibition can be two orders of magnitude larger than that for primary drainage the tracer concentration btcs show a non linearly decreasing profile with time i e the slope of the btcs reduces with time and the tailing concentration reaches a plateau after calibrating the two phase flow condition distribution of sw and u w it is found that previously developed macro scale kis tracer reactive transport models by tatomir et al 2015 tatomir et al 2018 can be used for simulation and interpretation of push pull experiments it is found that the magnitude of the peak at the beginning of btcs is determined by the specific interfacial area created during primary drainage and the constant tailing concentration is determined by the specific interfacial area associated with residual napl after main imbibition the time to approach steady state tailing concentration plateau depends largely on the dispersion coefficient through the column experiment with the push pull kis tracer method the specific fifa for the porous medium comprised of sphere glass beads with the mean diameter of 248 μm is determined as a w n d 240 1 m at saturation of s w d 0 33 during the primary drainage and a w n i 110 1 m at saturation of s w i 0 73 during the main imbibition this study demonstrated a new push pull kis tracer method for measuring the capillary associated fifa during dynamic two phase displacement processes this method has the potential to be considered in field sale applications future work is required to implement the column experiment with a variety of push pull flow rates to measure the fifa at different saturations future work is also required to extend the application the push pull kis tracer method to measure the fifa for porous media in a wider range of porous media comprised of glass beads and natural soils with different grain sizes and textures

39,the kinetic interface sensitive kis tracer experiment is a newly developed method to quantify the fluid fluid interfacial area fifa during drainage processes the concentration breakthrough curves obtained by measuring reaction product concentration in brine water samples after breakthrough are interpreted with a specialized numerical model to determine the fifa however this method has its own limitations since the volume of the usable water sample after breakthrough based on which the analysis takes place is often insufficient this happens because this volume strongly depends on the aquifer material i e sand type and system parameters an alternative is to employ kis tracers in a push pull experimental set up i e primary drainage is followed by a consequent main imbibition process with the flow direction being reversed this study applies a pore scale numerical model to study the kis tracer reactive transport during a push pull experiment in a 2d porous medium the advective dispersive reactive transport during both primary drainage and main imbibition processes is discussed the concentration breakthrough curves show a non linear descending trend with time until reaching a constant concentration at the steady state by analyzing the spatial concentration distribution and the concentration breakthrough curve the macro scale kis tracer reactive transport model can be interpreted for the push pull process finally the new method is applied in a column experiment where the determined specific interfacial area is found to be close to literature data keywords reactive

interfacial area fifa is essential for studying two phase flow and interphase mass transfer in porous materials miller et al 1990 hassanizadeh and gray 1990 existing techniques to measure fifa mainly include interfacial partitioning tracer tests iptt brusseau et al 2010 mcdonald et al 2016 x ray computed micro tomography xrct culligan et al 2004 porter et al 2010 and photo luminescent volumetric imaging pvi montemagno and gray 1995 one common limitation of these methods is that they are only feasible for steady state quasi static conditions tatomir et al 2018 a kinetic interface sensitive tracer test kis tt was recently developed for quantifying the fifa in dynamic two phase flow tatomir et al 2016 tatomir et al 2018 the kis tracer method determines the fifa for particular flow conditions induced by the injection of non aqueous phase liquids napls into the aquifer 1 1 background of the kis tracer the kis tracer compound was first synthesized as phenyl naphthalene 2 sulfonate 2 nsaph by schaffer et al 2013 the 2 nsaph is a non polar hydrolysable phenolic ester which dissolves in non polar liquids or napls when the napl with dissolved kis tracer interacts with the resident water phase the tracer molecules are being adsorbed onto the fluid fluid interface following langmuir s isotherm schaffer et al 2013 at the fluid fluid interface the adsorbed 2 nsaph molecules undergo an irreversible hydrolysis reaction 1 due to the excess supply of tracer i e its concentration at the interface stays constant at its maximum value the original first order hydrolysis reaction can be simplified to a pseudo zero order reaction schaffer et al 2013 expressed by 2 a w n m k r c δ t where rc kg s 1m 2 is the reaction rate of the kis tracer per unit interfacial area mk kg is the mass of the reaction product k δt is the reaction time and awn is the fifa m2 among the two reaction products naphthalene 2 sulfonate acid and phenol the naphthalene 2 sulfonate acid 2 nsa is the compound more easily measured in a tracer experiment because of its intrinsic fluorescent properties schaffer et al 2013 tatomir et al 2018 with the 2 nsa characterized by high polarity being highly hydrophilic and non adsorptive on either the water solid interface or the fluid fluid interfaces it can be expected to disperse rapidly into the bulk water at distance from the fluid fluid interface schaffer et al 2013 tatomir et al 2018 thus in a kis tracer experiment we measure the 2 nsa concentration in water and the obtained reacted 2 nsa mass mk can be used to calculate the interfacial area according to eq 2 with a constant zero order reaction at the interface the study of the 2 nsaph decay and transport in the napl becomes redundant and the most relevant component of study is the reaction product 2 nsa which is present only in the aqueous phase due to the working mechanism of the kis tt explained above the kis tt is mainly designed for field applications where a napl is necessary to be injected into the aquifer e g geological storage of supercritical carbon dioxide the migration of the co2 plume the capillary trapping of co2 and the dissolution of co2 into the brine are all relevant to the fifa which can be tracked by employing the kis tracer during the co2 injection besides the kis tt can also be applied to estimate the fifa during infiltration of napl contaminants into the aquifer by running a laboratory kis tt with a portion of uncontaminated medium excavated from the site at the approximate flow conditions from the contaminated sites the fifa can be classified into film associated fifa capillary associated fifa which can be further subdivided into a mobile part and an immobile part tatomir et al 2018 first applied the kis tracer in drainage experiments in a column to measure the capillary associated fifa and thus the method is here termed drainage kis tracer method for dynamic conditions in the work of tatomir et al 2018 the kis tracer was dissolved in n octane napl to drain the initially water saturated column the porous media was well characterized in terms of grain size porosity and permeability of the glass beads packing at the column outlet samples were collected and measured at defined time intervals and plotted as btcs of 2 nsa concentration and cumulative pore volumes of the fluids the experimental data was analyzed by employing a macro scale two phase flow reactive transport model with the interfacial reaction of the tracer being specified in the zones where two fluids coexist tatomir et al 2015 tatomir et al 2019 the resulting maximum specific fifa was determined at between 500 and 540 m 1 for glass beads with a mean diameter of 248 μm furthermore applying a pore scale direct numerical simulation method gao et al 2021a studied the effect of hydrodynamically stagnant zones on the drainage kis tracer method in a conceptual 2d porous medium by analyzing the quantified interfacial area and reacted solute mass in the flowing and stagnant zones gao et al 2021a proposed that the 2 nsa mass in the flowing water is mainly produced by the reaction taking place at the moving menisci and a fraction of solute mass produced by the moving menisci can be retained in the newly formed stagnant zones during displacement this realization made it clear that there is a portion of the interfacial area related to the stagnant zones which cannot be accounted for they concluded that the drainage kis tracer method measures that fraction of fifa with a common boundary to the mobile water gao et al 2021b further consider the condition of variable surface roughness of the mineral grains in order to determine any potential losses related to surface roughness they found that a mobile mass retention term needs only to be considered when the root mean square roughness is larger than 3 μm concluding that the drainage kis tracer method is also feasible for the determination of the mobile fifa when the grain surface is reasonably rough e g natural soils 1 2 a novel push pull kis tracer method despite the promising results in the previous studies the drainage kis tracer method has two major limitations first the volume of usable effluent water sample containing the reacted tracer is often insufficient in the column experiments the 2 nsa concentration measured at the outlet is zero at early times before breakthrough arrival of n octane front at the outlet and starts to increase only after first arrival of the tracer which implies that usable data can only be obtained from a water sample retrieved after first arrival of the tracer tatomir et al 2018 when in the effluent the volume fraction of water at the outlet sharply changes from one to zero hardly any water samples with the reacted tracer can be retrieved because of insufficient water volume being discharged the discharged water volume after first arrival of the tracer is dependent on the grain sizes and sand types by conducting column experiments with unconsolidated porous media composed either of glass beads or natural soils of variable grain size it was found that the drainage kis tracer method is only applicable for fine sands mostly of mean diameter smaller than 250 μm and the water sample volumes collected during the experiments using natural soils generally are smaller than those composed of glass beads tatomir et al 2022 the volume of the available water sample after breakthrough also depends on system parameters capillary number fluid viscosity etc a stable displacement without fingering front pattern may lead to only small volumes of water discharged after breakthrough this is also relevant when field scale applications of the drainage kis tracer method in natural aquifers are being planned since natural aquifers generally exhibit a wide spectrum of sedimentary architectural elements clay lenses gravel lenses of different geometric and hydraulic properties including variable grain size grain textures and system parameters the second limitation of the drainage kis tracer method is that the reacted 2 nsa mass observable in the effluent is only relevant to the mobile fifa at the front gao et al 2021a and the magnitude of the total specific fifa cannot be measured the information about the fifa associated with capillary trapping in the hydrodynamically stagnant zones is missing to overcome the above limitations we propose a novel push pull kis tracer method fig 1 the kis tracer is dissolved in a finite volume of napl and injected into the water saturated aquifer push phase then instead of monitoring the effluent concentration at another port well fluids are abstracted at the inlet after start of the pull phase immediately after the primary drainage process and the porous material undergoes an imbibition process with reversed flow direction the effluent mainly composed of mobile napl at beginning followed by the discharged water which can be sampled to measure the 2 nsa concentration btcs in this case the volume of water available for the measurement of the reaction product acid 2 nsa concentration is no longer limited by the type of sand or an unstable displacement in the imbibition process as water becomes the continuous flowing phase both 2 nsa mass reacted at the water napl front as well as in the capillary trapped water can both expected to be transported and measured and thus the total mobile and immobile fifa can be measured besides the push pull kis tracer method requires only one single well for experimental operations and thus it is more economical for field application especially for deep aquifers the push pull tests do not require such extended operation times compared to those of a napl plume travelling between injection and to a monitoring well and thus the push pull kis tracer method can be conducted much faster furthermore the push pull tests have widely been used along with various types of tracers in the study of e g residual napl saturation tomich et al 1973 davis et al 2002 istok et al 2002 microbial activities istok et al 1997 urmann et al 2005 methane oxidation gómez et al 2008 solute sorption to aquifer sediments istok et al 1999 schroth et al 2000 assessment of the effective heat exchange surface area in geothermal applications ghergut et al 2013 etc to the authors knowledge a tracer push pull experiment has not yet been applied for the determination of the fifa for dynamic conditions 1 3 pore scale direct numerical simulation pore scale study approaches i e image based experiments using transparent microfluidic devices or direction numerical simulations play important roles in understanding the pore scale phenomena and can provide fundamental insights to understand the macro scale processes meakin and tartakovsky 2009 for example the transient two phase flow and the dynamics of the interfacial area are directly resolved at the pore scale in experiments by karadimitriou et al 2014 and godinez brizuela et al 2017 using micro models with pore networks representing two dimensional porous media with the development of computers and numerical tools direct numerical simulation of two phase flow and reactive transport at the pore scale by applying computational fluid dynamics cfd methods has become available in a previous work a pore scale based numerical approach for the kis tracer was built with the phase field method pfm by gao et al 2021a the pfm is outstanding for simulations of the kis tracer reactive transport compared to other widely applied two phase flow reactive transport models e g lattice boltzmann method volume of fluid method level set method etc because the interface is resolved as a thin diffusive layer formed by the mixture of two fluids according to thermodynamic principles thus the zero order reaction of the kis tracer at fluid fluid interface can be directly implemented as a homogenous bulk reaction in the region of the diffusive interface at the pore scale the transport of reacted 2 nsa involves several important mechanisms including advection molecular diffusion partitioning distribution between the two fluid phase as well as the zero order reaction at the interface all these mechanisms are simulated with a continuous solute transport cst formulation derived in the pfm framework by gao et al 2021a and the pfm cst model is verified with analytical solutions of advective diffusion reactive diffusion and interphase mass transfer processes 1 4 objectives here we employ the pfm cst model to simulate a push pull kis tracer experiment in a conceptual 2d porous medium this study aims at 1 providing a pore scale insight into reactive transport of the interfacially reactive and water dissolved tracer during primary drainage and main imbibition at 2 validating the macro scale numerical model used to interpret the btcs obtained from push pull kis tracer experiments and at 3 proving the concept of push pull kis tracer method through a column experiment the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the theory of the mathematical and the numerical models employed the details of the model setup for the pore scale numerical experiment as well as the macro scale reactive transport numerical model are outlined in section 3 the application of the new method to column experiments is elaborated in section 4 the results and discussions are demonstrated in section 5 finally section 6 lists the main conclusions and findings 2 mathematic model 2 1 phase field method the theory of the pfm is described in detail in e g jacqmin 1999 badalassi et al 2003 yue et al 2004 alpak et al 2016 in this chapter we briefly review the equations implemented in the two phase flow model the pfm treats the interface as a thin diffusive layer formed by a mixture of two fluids and a smoothly changing phase variable ϕ varying between 1 and 1 is introduced to describe the composition of the fluid mixture a fundamental concept of the pfm is that free energy density can be expressed as a function of the phase variable and its gradient jacqmin 1999 the free energy density fmix j m3 for an isothermal mixing of two fluids can be expressed in the ginzburg landau form yue et al 2006 3 f m i x ϕ ϕ 1 2 λ ϕ 2 λ 4 ε 2 ϕ 2 1 2 where λ n is the magnitude of the mixing energy and ε m is the capillary thickness which determines the thickness of the diffusive interface at equilibrium yue et al 2004 the first term on the right side of the above equation accounts for the surface energy and the second term accounts for the bulk energy which has two minima corresponding to the two stable phases of fluids basirat et al 2017 the chemical potential g j m3 can be defined as the variation of free energy with respect to the dimensionless phase variable 4 g δ ω f m i x d x δ ϕ λ 2 ϕ λ ε 2 ϕ ϕ 2 1 where ω is the region of space occupied by the fluids the interfacial tension σ n m is the total free energy at the interface per unit interfacial area which is related to the capillary thickness and the mixing energy density through eq 5 yue et al 2004 5 σ 2 2 λ 3 ε fluid mass conservation is governed by the cahn hilliard equation eq 6 which assumes that the diffusive fluid flux is proportional to the gradient of the chemical potential cahn and hilliard 1959 6 ϕ t u ϕ γ g where u is the fluid velocity vector and γ m3s kg is the mobility which governs the intensity of the diffusive fluid flux and the relaxation time of the interface akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2013 the mobility γ needs to be large enough to maintain a constant thickness of the interface but small enough not to suppress the flow jacqmin 1999 the mobility γ is generally expressed as a function of the capillary thickness and a tuning factor introduced as γ χε2 the tuning factor χ m s kg is denoted as the characteristic mobility 2 2 two phase flow dynamics momentum conservation is governed by the navier stokes equations for incompressible fluids eq 7 where interfacial tension is considered as a body force following the concept of the pfm approach 7 ρ u t u u p i μ u u t g ϕ 8 u 0 where i is the second order identity tensor p is pressure and ρ and μ are respectively the density and viscosity of the mixture non wetting and wetting fluid according to the volume fraction of the fluids vf α α w nw 9 v f w 1 ϕ 2 and v f n w 1 ϕ 2 and 10 ρ ρ w v f w ρ n w v f n w and μ μ w v f w μ n w v f n w where subscripts w and nw indicate wetting and non wetting phase respectively the incompressible formalism of the navier stokes equations can applied for the mixture condition at the interface as long as the interface thickness is small enough so that the results remain unaffected lowengrub and truskinovsky 1998 zhou et al 2010 at the grain surfaces a no slip boundary condition is applied with u 0 in eq 7 for solid wall boundaries the wetting condition on the solid wall is expressed by 11 n ϕ cos θ w ϕ where n is the outward normal vector to the wall and θ w is the contact angle 2 3 reactive transport the reactive transport model based on the phase field method was developed in gao et al 2021a the model considers kis tracer transport mechanisms including advection molecular diffusion partitioning between two immiscible fluids and reaction at the interface here we briefly review the major components of the reactive transport model for a solute k dissolved in a fluid phase α of mass concentration c a k the solute mass conservation equation writes as gao et al 2021a 12 v f w c w k t u v f w c w k 0 5 γ g c w k 0 v f n w c n w k t u v f n w c n w k 0 5 γ g c n w k 0 where only solute advection due to the bulk fluid motion is included the local thermodynamic equilibrium of the solute in a two phase system is described by a partitioning coefficient pow k defined as the concentration ratio of the solute in each phase at equilibrium condition 13 p o w k c n w k c w k where cnw k and cw k are the concentrations of the product 2 nsa in the non wetting phase and the wetting phase respectively and pow k is the partition coefficient to obtain the single field formulation of the 2 nsa concentration for both phases in the entire domain the global concentration is defined as 14 c k v f w c w k v f n w c n w k the solute diffusion flux for the mixture is defined as haroun et al 2010 15 j k d k v f w c w k v f n w c n w k d k c k c w k c n w k v f w as vf w vf nw 1 here only vf w is used in the expression and dk is the effective dispersion coefficient the diffusion term eq 15 indicates an additional flux term derived from the solubility law this solubility flux is in normal direction to the interface which governs the distribution of the species between the two phases thus by incorporating the equations from eq 12 to eq 15 and adding the source term for the chemical reaction the final governing equation for the global concentration of solute k is reorganized c k t u c k 0 5 γ g c k 1 p ow k v f w p ow k 1 v f w 16 d k c k v f w c k 1 p ow k v f w p ow k 1 v f w r c dif 0 where r c d i f kg s 1m 3 is the zero order interfacial reaction of the kis tracer which is assumed in the model as a homogeneous reaction taking place at the diffusive interface the interfacial reaction region is taken with vf w 0 05 0 95 whose thickness is bwn 4 1641ε yue et al 2004 with the constant interface thickness the reaction rate per unit interfacial region for the model can be calculated as 17 r c d i f r c b w n v f w 0 05 0 95 0 v f w 0 0 05 0 95 1 where rc kg s 1m 2 is the tracer reaction rate per unit sharp interfacial area 3 numerical model the numerical implementation is explained in section 3 1 the details of the pore scale numerical simulation setup are shown in section 3 2 the data treatment to obtain the concentration breakthrough curve and volume averaged parameters inside the domain are shown in section 3 3 3 1 numerical implementation the model is implemented in comsol multiphysics a software for solving of partial differential equations employing the finite element method for spatial discretization tatomir et al 2018 gao et al 2022 the linear solver pardiso is used to solve the set of partial differential equations the implicit backward euler method is used to solve the time stepping the initial time step and maximum time steps are controlled to be small enough in order to avoid singularities the mesh is generated in comsol with triangular elements the advancing front algorithm is applied for the tessellation gao et al 2021b most of the mesh elements are controlled to be regular triangles with a side length of h the computations were performed on a single cpu with 8 cores operating at 4 3 ghz and a memory of 128 gb ram 3 2 pore scale numerical experiment setups the study domain is assumed as a two dimensional rectangle measuring in total 14 72 mm 3 53 mm length width including two rectangles as inlets for the fluids on both sides of a porous domain in between measuring 14 53 mm 3 53 mm in size as shown in fig 2 a the 2d domain is assumed to be horizontal so that the gravity is neglected the pore space is shaped by circular grains which have been widely used in micro fluidic experiments and pore scale numerical studies ferrari and lunati 2013 liu et al 2014 godinez brizuela et al 2017 each grain bears a size randomly chosen from three potential choices with diameters of 225 μm 250 μm or 275 μm which are similar to the size of the glass beads used for column experiment in section 4 the grains are first uniformly distributed to fill the domain explained in fig 2 b then each grain is moved from its original place in both x and y directions the distances of the movement in both directions are randomly determined but controlled to be shorter than 20 μm and the grains do not overlap the porous medium is built at a porosity of 47 56 the domain is discretized with triangular elements most of which have a side length of h 8 10 6 m and two layers of mesh on the solid wall are further refined with a thickness of h 2 10 6 m to better resolve the flow condition near the solid wall as shown in fig 2 c the capillary thickness for the model is set at ε 1 10 5 m so that the interface is resolved with adequate meshes gao et al 2021a the relevant physical properties of the non wetting fluid n octane are its density ρnw 703 kg m3 and viscosity μnw 0 54 10 3 pa s the interfacial tension between n octane and water is σ 0 0504 n m tatomir et al 2018 the porous medium is water wet with a contact angle between the two phases being θ w 45 the simulation is carried out for a drainage process followed by an imbibition process during drainage the porous domain is initially filled with water and the inlet on the left hand side is initially filled with n octane with the tracer dissolved the initial location of the interface is determined red dashed line in fig 2 necessary to ascertain numerical stability at t 0 the n octane with the tracer dissolved in it is injected at the left boundary to displace the water at a constant velocity or specific flux of uin 0 025 m s and the right hand side of the domain is the outlet with pressure equal to zero the inflow rate is within the range given in the pore scale study of geological storage of co2 by basirat et al 2017 the inflow rate is chosen to be large enough for the entrance of the non wetting phase into the domain meanwhile the flow is ensured to be laminar gao et al 2021a the reynolds number associated with the displacement can be calculated as re uin ρ lc μnw the averaged width of the throat in the porous media lc 0 062 mm estimated from distances between centers of the circular grains and thus the reynolds number is re 2 which indicates the flow regime is laminar the capillary number for the system is calculated as ca uin μnw σ thus the capillary number is obtained as ca 2 5 10 4 with a viscosity ratio μnw μw of 0 5 the displacement process is considered as a transition regime between a stable displacement and a fingering displacement regime according to the diagram given by lenormand et al 1988 drainage period lasts for 0 15 s and this duration time is chosen such that the front does not arrive the outlet then imbibition begins at t 0 15 s as initial conditions for the simulation of the imbibition process simulated state variables of the last time step of the drainage period are specified during imbibition water is injected at the right boundary to displace the n octane at a constant velocity or specific flux of uin 0 05 m s the imbibition lasts until an equilibrium acid 2 nsa concentration in the domain is obtained in both drainage and imbibition the upper and lower sides of the domain are symmetry free slip and no flow boundaries the characteristic mobility is χ 25 m s kg for the drainage and χ 50 m s kg for the imbibition large enough to maintain the constant thickness of the interface during the simulation gao et al 2021a the initial 2 nsa concentration in the domain is zero and the 2 nsa is only produced by the interfacial reaction following the theory of the kis tracer the zero order reaction rate is assumed to be r c d i f 1 kg m 3 s 1 the partitioning coefficient is set at pow 0 01 therefore the partitioning of the 2 nsa into the n octane is negligible gao et al 2021a the transport of the produced 2 nsa can occur in an advection dominated regime a diffusion dominated regime or a transition regime in between gao et al 2021a the transport regime is dependent on the ratio of advective to diffusive transport rates described by the péclet number pe uin lc dk up to now the application of the kis tracer in laboratory column experiments e g by tatomir et al 2018 2022 are mainly conducted at pe ranging from 1 to 10 thus the pore scale modeling here also aims at investigating the transport of 2 nsa for pe within this range with the chosen inflow velocity and characteristic length as explained in the last paragraph the effective dispersion coefficient of the solute is assumed to be dk 1 10 6 m2 s resulting in the péclet numbers of pe 1 55 and pe 3 1 for drainage and imbibition respectively the 2 nsa concentration breakthrough curve is obtained at the measurement line on the left hand side of the domain at the same location as the initial interface was initially positioned plotted with red dashed line in fig 2 the 2 nsa concentration distribution in the domain is monitored in seven representative element volume rev domains along the longitudinal direction labelled as rev 1 7 in fig 2 a each rev measures 3 6325 mm 3 53 mm in size the porosity within randomly distributed frames with sizes range from 0 2 to 12 8 mm2 inside the porous medium are analyzed as shown in fig 2 d the results show that the calculated porosity becomes stable at approximately 47 56 with regard to the domain size close to 12 8 mm2 and this indicates the chosen rev is reasonable 3 3 pore scale data treatment the 2 nsa concentration c w b t c passing through the measurement line control plane can be obtained by dividing the 2 nsa mass flowrate mbtc with the water volume flowrate uw btc that is passing through the measurement line 18 c w b t c m b t c u w b t c the 2 nsa mass flux that passing through the measurement line can be obtained with 19 m b t c l m u n c k d l where un is the magnitude of the velocity normal to the outlet and lm is the measurement line the volume of water flow that is passing through the measurement line can be obtained with 20 u w b t c l m u n δ w d l where δ w is the function indicating the aqueous phase 21 δ w 1 f o r v f w 0 5 1 δ w 0 f o r v f w 0 0 5 besides the macro scale parameters in the domain e g water saturation specific interfacial area macro scale 2 nsa concentration over the revs can be obtained from the pore scale simulation results the diffusive interfacial area a w n d i f in the domain and the corresponding sharp interfacial area awn can be calculated with 22 a w n d i f v v δ i f a d v and a w n a w n d i f b w n where vv is the void space in the porous domain δ ifa is the function indicating the diffusive

interfacial area in the rev domains can be obtained as 24 a w n a w n v p where vp is the bulk volume of the porous medium the water saturation in the rev domain can be obtained as 25 s w v v δ w d v v v the averaged 2 nsa concentration in the rev domain can be calculated as 26 c w v v c k d v v v δ w d v 3 4 continuum scale numerical modeling the breakthrough curve obtained from a push pull kis tracer experiment needs to be interpreted using a macro scale reactive transport model to obtain the measured fifa in this research the macro scale reactive transport model is validated for the push pull process by applying it to a single one dimensional simulation in the longitudinal direction with the same setup as the pore scale study the model section 3 2 is set up at the pore scale in two dimensions and in one dimension at the macro scale the reactive transport model of the kis tracer transport in the immiscible drainage process was demonstrated in tatomir et al 2018 where transport of the acid is described by an advection dispersion reaction equation 27 φ s w c w t c w u w d d i s c w r c a w n 0 where φ is the porosity φ vv vp uw is the macro scale water phase velocity ddis is the dispersion coefficient and cw is the macro scale 2 nsa concentration water saturation sw in the reactive transport model is obtained from the macro scale two phase flow model in tatomir et al 2018 where the extended darcy s law for two phase flow was applied this requires knowing of the petrophysical properties of the porous media i e the capillary pressure saturation relation functions and relative permeabilities of both phases for push pull processes which need to be determined with complicated processes whereas the macro scale two phase flow model is not required here for the numerical experiment at pore scale since the saturation in the region drained or flooded behind the moving front remains almost unchanged spatially the saturation distribution can be explicitly represented by step functions based on the pore scale simulation results with the constant front advancing velocity in push and pull processes u f d and u f i assuming the one dimension domain at 0 x xmax mm with the inlet at x 0 and td for the total time of drainage process the location of the front can be directly calculated with u f d t for primary drainage and u f d t d u f i t t d for main imbibition the water saturation during the drainage push stage is defined as 28 s w s w d f o r x u f d t s w 1 f o r x u f d t and the water saturation during the imbibition pull stage is defined as

simulation in section 3 1 with the assumed unit reaction rate in section 3 2 the tracer reaction rate for the simulation is calculated as r c r c d i f b w n 4 16 10 5 kg s 1m 2 4 column experiment the push pull kis tracer method is applied to column experiments the materials and experimental setup are demonstrated in section 4 1 and the experimental procedure is explained in section 4 2 4 1 materials and setup the setup of the column experiment is demonstrated in fig 2 a the stainless steel column is positioned vertically with a length of 30 cm and a diameter of 3 cm both ends of the column are sealed by two stainless steel caps embedded with a porous frit which create a uniform distribution of fluids entering leaving the column and retain the glass beads in the column both tubes on the two caps are connected to 3 2 way valves and each tube leads to either a peristaltic pump connecting to a fluid tank or an outlet with effluent collected with a measuring cylinder the n octane dissolved with kis tracer tank is connected to the top of the column and the water tank is connected to the bottom of the column the column is packed with glass beads with a mean diameter of 248 μm the glass beads have an average roundness of 0 983 and a neglectable surface roughness as shown in fig 2 b the grain size distribution of the glass beads is shown in fig 2 c the grain roundness and size distribution is measured from the microscopic images of more than 200 randomly selected beads the unconsolidated porous medium has a porosity of 38 39 and an intrinsic permeability at 8 10 12 m2 1 10 11 m2 measured by tatomir et al 2018 furthermore the deionized water is used as the wetting phase fluid and the n octane is used as the non wetting phase fluid the main properties of the fluids have been given in section 3 1 the kis tracer is dissolved in n octane at a concentration of 0 1 g l and the hydrolysis reaction rate of the tracer is determined as rc 1 18 10 12 kg m 2 s 1 tatomir et al 2018 fig 3 4 2 experimental procedure prior to the experiment the column is first packed with the dry glass beads the packing is done in small increments while vibrating the column to ensure a homogeneous medium to prepare a water saturated column the de ionized water is injected from bottom of the column to slowly displace the air inside the column and the top of column is connected to the outlet the total pore space is determined from the injected water volume as 82 ml after the column is saturated with water water flushing will continue for 24 h to ensure that the sand is clean no residual pollutants from previous experiments and a constant background fluorescence signal can be determined in the effluent the experiment begins by injection of 30 ml n octane kis tracer dissolved at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min from top of the column with the bottom of column connecting to the outlet the capillary number is obtained as ca 1 18 10 7 with a viscosity ratio μnw μw of 0 5 the displacement process is considered as a transition regime close to a capillary fingering displacement one the n octane injection drainage process last for 1 hour the front of the n octane is ensured not to arrive the bottom of the column because about 55 ml n octane is necessary for a breakthrough determined from previous study by tatomir et al 2018 then by switching the valve the water is injected at a flow rate of 1 ml min from bottom of the column with the top of column as the outlet at the beginning of the imbibition there is only n octane coming out from the column the total effluent n octane volume is about 18 ml with observation of the first water bubble in cylinder at outlet the water sample will be collected by 5 ml measuring cylinders and transferred for concentration measurement in the fluorospectrometer cary eclipse fluorospectrometer from varian each water sample volume is larger than 1 ml to ensure an accurate fluorescent measurement the time the water sample volume and acid concentration are always recorded during the experiment to obtain the resulting tracer breakthrough curve the measurement last until the decreasing of the acid concentration in water samples are very small about 1 5 hour of imbibition meaning the approaching of a steady state after each experiment the glass beads were washed and dried over 48 h the measured acid concentration is pretreated by deducting the background fluorescence signal to obtain the final experiment data in total three experiments are done in the same way triplicate to ensure the reproducibility 5 results and discussion in section 5 1 we present the pore scale concentration distribution patterns during the push pull process and compare to the macro scale reactive transport model in section 5 2 the corresponding concentration btcs are shown and their interpretation is being discussed in section 5 3 the new push pull kis tracer method is applied in the column experiment 5 1 concentration distributions from the pore scale simulation the spatial concentration distribution at t 0 07 s t 0 15 s t 0 18 s t 0 21 s t 0 24 s t 0 32 s during the push pull process is illustrated in fig 4 a together with the corresponding average 2 nsa concentration over the revs in fig 4 b during the primary drainage push phase t 0 07 s t 0 15 s in fig 4a the receding water is partially entrapped by the invading n octane forming the trapped water clusters the local concentration of the reacted acid 2 nsa in these trapped water clusters pockets largely differ among each other depending on the size of the associated interface and the volume of the water cluster the water clusters with a smaller volume generally show much higher local 2 nsa concentrations the reacted acid in the water clusters is not mixed with each other because the water clusters are isolated from each other by the invading napl phase during drainage the effects of advective and dispersive transport of the reacted acid is minor only noticeable at the moving front where the reacted acid mass is low and negligible compared to that in trapped water clusters the weak dispersion was also observed in the previous column drainage experiments reported by tatomir et al 2018 average concentration monitored in the revs for primary drainage is plotted in fig 4b t 0 07 s and t 0 15 s it can be observed that during the push stage average concentration in the domain linearly decreases in flow direction with its maximum being near the inlet this is because near the inlet the two fluids remain in contact with each other for longer which means that tracer accumulates in the water clusters as a consequence of the reaction across the fluid fluid interface the spatial 2 nsa concentration distribution during main imbibition pull phase is shown in fig 4 a at t 0 18 s t 0 21 s the invading water pushes the napl front back with mobile napl flowing towards the outlet left boundary and the immobile napl being trapped in the domain residual trapping with the front being pushed back during main imbibition the trapped water clusters are released and connected again with the flowing bulk water in the meantime the reacted acid present in these water clusters is released and mixed with the flowing water the acid dissolved and mixed in the flowing water is subjected to advective dispersive diffusive transport during main imbibition which leads to a non linearly decreasing concentration gradient in longitudinal direction as shown in fig 4 b at t 0 18 s t 0 21 s the main processes facilitating mixing of acid with fresh water in the flooded region are mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion when the wetting phase front arrives at the inlet left boundary at t 0 21 s the effluent changes from napl to water and the tracer breakthrough commences as main imbibition pull stage proceeds the 2 nsa concentration and phase distribution patterns approach steady state shown in fig 4 a for t 0 24 s and t 0 32 s the kis tracer dissolved in the residual napl i e trapped napl clusters in the domain continues to react at the interface with the flowing water and the generated acid mass is further transported towards the left boundary and the measurement control reference line when the system approaches steady state a constant effluent acid concentration can be obtained resulting from the reaction at the interfaces associated with the residual napl the average 2 nsa concentration in the porous domain almost linearly decreases in longitudinal direction as shown in fig 4b t 0 32 s then the macro scale reactive transport model is compared it to pore scale simulation results as shown in fig 4 b the concentration distribution of the macro scale reactive transport model blue dashed lines match very well with the pore scale simulation results red dots in the push pull process the root mean square errors rmse range from 0 0006 to 0 0024 kg m3 the dispersion coefficient applied for the simulation of main imbibition d d i s i 1 10 5 m2 s is two orders of magnitude larger than that for the primary drainage phase d d i s d 1 10 7 m2 s this observation of significant differences between the dispersion coefficients from primary drainage and main imbibition matches the results from the experimental study by chen et al 2021 applying xrct characterization furthermore the accuracy of explicit expression of two phase flow is tested by comparing it to the average sw and awn obtained from the revs at t 0 07 s t 0 15 s for primary drainage and t 0 18 s t 0 24 s for main imbibition as shown in fig 5 it is observed that with s w d 0 376 s w i 0 906 a w n d 976 1 m a w n i 340 1 m the macro scale explicit expression dashed line in fig 5 can generally approximate the pore scale simulated two phase flow during primary drainage sw and awn in the drained region are more or less spatially invariable and thus the explicit expression using the step functions matches the pore scale simulation of saturation and interfacial area with rmse up to 0 047 for the saturation and 67 1 m for the specific interfacial area however during main imbibition sw in the flooded region shows slightly increasing trends toward the right which causes a small deviation with rmse up to 0 085 shown in fig 5 at t 0 18 s and t 0 24 s thus the predicted awn during main imbibition also has slightly larger deviations with rmse up to 223 1 m it is worth noting that the explicit expression assuming a sharp and stable front approximates the pore scale simulation very well reason being that because the porous domain is small in extent macroscopically it can be considered as highly homogeneous 5 2 interpretation of the breakthrough curve after calibrating the two phase flow saturation distribution and specific interfacial area to the pore scale numerical experiment the 2 nsa concentration breakthrough curves obtained from the pore scale simulations dotted line and the macro scale reactive transport model continuous line are shown in fig 6 a it can be seen that the macro scale reactive transport model matches the concentration breakthrough curve of the pore scale numerical experiment well with rmse 0 0012 kg m3 the effluent 2 nsa concentration decreases non linearly with time and the rate of decrease in concentration slows down with time the tailing concentration is asymptotically reaching a plateau when the system approaches a steady state in a push pull kis tracer experiment the dispersion coefficient and the specific interfacial area need to be obtained by fitting the concentration btcs of the experiment and the macro scale reactive transport model thus it is necessary to understand how these two parameters awn and ddis affect the concentration btcs by a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is performed by systematically changing one parameter at a time using the calibrated macro scale model of section 5 1 while keeping all other parameters constant the specific interfacial area for primary drainage a w n d is swapped and plotted in fig 6 b peak concentration at early times of breakthrough significantly changes with respect to different a w n d values this is because the concentration peak is mainly controlled by 2 nsa released from trapped water clusters where the reaction rate is determined by the interfacial area created in the drained region during primary drainage the 2 nsa released from trapped water clusters accumulates in the retracting water during the pull stage and this leads to the peak of concentration right after the breakthrough because all drained regions are flooded after breakthrough during main imbibition a w n d no longer affects the concentration btcs at steady state the interfacial area in main imbibition a w n i is also systematically varied and plotted in fig 6 c it can be observed that the steady state tailing 2 nsa concentration varies with different a w n i values at steady state the cumulative volume of the napl clusters and the fluid fluid interfaces do not change resulting in a constant production rate of the reacted tracer in the whole porous domain the 2 nsa production at steady state strongly depends on the magnitude of the interfacial area in contact with the residual napl phase formed during main imbibition furthermore fig 6 d shows results of the sensitivity analysis with respect to the dispersion coefficient during main imbibition d d i s i it can be observed that a change in dispersion coefficient changes the shape of the btc i e for higher dispersion coefficients the decrease in concentration takes longer for steady state concentration to be reached and the peak concentration is lower the time for the btcs to reach steady state concentration only depends on the dispersion coefficient and it is not affected by the magnitude of the specific interfacial area the results imply that by matching the macro scale model breakthrough and the corresponding btcs obtained from a push pull kis tracer experiment the three parameters i e d d i s i a w n d and a w n i can be determined in sequence a sole best fit value for each parameter can be found independently first the dispersion coefficient can directly be determined from the time it takes for the btcs to approach tailing concentration plateau this time not affected by a w n d and a w n i then the specific interfacial areas created during primary drainage and main imbibition can be determined from the magnitudes of the peak concentration and tailing concentration from the btcs respectively 5 3 application to column experiments finally the concept of the push pull kis tracer method is proved through the column experiment the concentration breakthrough curves from three triplicate experiments are obtained and plotted in fig 7 a the three triplicate experiments fit each other well which proves the reproducibility of the experiment each experiment has about 17 usable data points after breakthrough and before the steady state and each water sample has volume of 2 5 ml depending on the time interval this implies that the limitation of few usable water samples in the previous drainage kis tracer experiments is overcame by the push pull setting with the sufficient sample volume the shapes of the btcs can be more accurately determined to measure the fifa the data need to be interpreted by matching to the macro scale reactive transport model eq 27 where two phase flow condition is first determined the saturation distribution in the column experiment is again approximated with the step functions described in section 3 4 and a sharp front is assumed this is reasonable because it is observed from the top of column during the pull stage that the effluent turning from n octane 100 to water 100 when the first water bubble is observed this fast change may result from a sharp front another reason could be that the sphere glass beads used are well sorted with quite uniform grain sizes around 250 μm from the previous drainage experiment by tatomir et al 2018 it is known that about 55 ml n octane is used to drain the full column as the total pore space is 82 ml the s w d 0 33 is calculated with injection of 30 ml n octane in one hour the maximum distance of the front travelled during drainage can be calculated as 16 4 cm and front velocity u f d 4 545 10 5 m s is calculated as 18 ml n octane is recovered during main imbibition s w i 0 73 can be calculated for the flooded region with the observation time for effluent turning from n octane to water t 4680 s the front velocity can be calculated u f d 1 515 10 4 m s then it is found that with the dispersion coefficient d d i s i 8 10 7 m2 s the specific interfacial area a w n d 240 1 m and a w n i 110 1 m the btc predicted from the macro scale reactive transport model eq 27 can well fit the experimental data with a minimum rmse 0 24 μg l as shown in solid line in fig 7 a furthermore the confidence interval is investigated to show the tolerance and the uncertainties in the measurements the confidence interval is obtained by perturbing the best fit parameters i e d d i s i a w n d and a w n i within certain ranges where the resulting sets of btcs from the simulations with a sweep of the three parameters in the ranges can capture most experiment data points a 98 confidence interval is found with ranges of parameters d d i s i 7 10 7 9 10 7 m2 s a w n d 210 265 1 m and a w n i 72 155 1 m as outlined in dashed lines in fig 7 a and fig 7 b the obtained average specific interfacial areas for primary drainage and main imbibition are consistent with the results from culligan et al 2004 and slightly smaller than that from porter et al 2010 where the fifa is measured with xrct as shown in fig 7 b the measured fifa is also within the range predicted with the kis tracer experiment in the previous work of tatomir et al 2022 for primary drainage additionally the results imply that the push pull kis tracer is not sensitive to water films adsorbed on grain surfaces since the fifa measured is much smaller than that predicted from iptt tracer methods with film associated fifa included e g work by brusseau et al 2009 brusseau et al 2010 and mcdonald et al 2016 because the water films have thicknesses of only few molecules the small mass could make it deplete fast with the hydrolysis reaction to the tracer thus the water films contribute very little in the experiment it worth noting that the capillary condensed water for the grains with rough surfaces is not relevant for this study because the glass beads applied here have smooth surfaces 6 summary and conclusions kis tracer reactive transport was studied by pore scale simulations conducted employing the pfm cst model for a 2d porous medium push pull experiment in order to investigate whether the pore scale processes can be simulated in a large scale continuum modeling approach and in how far important parameter such as interfacial area awn and dispersion coefficient ddis can independently be obtained from the experimental breakthrough signal the ability of the new push pull kis tracer method for determination of the fifa was demonstrated in the column experiment the major results and findings of the study are listed below the advective and dispersive transport of the tracer is very weak during primary drainage but becomes more prominent during main imbibition the dispersion coefficient for main imbibition can be two orders of magnitude larger than that for primary drainage the tracer concentration btcs show a non linearly decreasing profile with time i e the slope of the btcs reduces with time and the tailing concentration reaches a plateau after calibrating the two phase flow condition distribution of sw and u w it is found that previously developed macro scale kis tracer reactive transport models by tatomir et al 2015 tatomir et al 2018 can be used for simulation and interpretation of push pull experiments it is found that the magnitude of the peak at the beginning of btcs is determined by the specific interfacial area created during primary drainage and the constant tailing concentration is determined by the specific interfacial area associated with residual napl after main imbibition the time to approach steady state tailing concentration plateau depends largely on the dispersion coefficient through the column experiment with the push pull kis tracer method the specific fifa for the porous medium comprised of sphere glass beads with the mean diameter of 248 μm is determined as a w n d 240 1 m at saturation of s w d 0 33 during the primary drainage and a w n i 110 1 m at saturation of s w i 0 73 during the main imbibition this study demonstrated a new push pull kis tracer method for measuring the capillary associated fifa during dynamic two phase displacement processes this method has the potential to be considered in field sale applications future work is required to implement the column experiment with a variety of push pull flow rates to measure the fifa at different saturations future work is also required to extend the application the push pull kis tracer method to measure the fifa for porous media in a wider range of porous media comprised of glass beads and natural soils with different grain sizes and textures
