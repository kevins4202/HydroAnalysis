5065,population growth and associated anthropogenic activities such as mining are posing a major threat to water resources remote sensing provides valuable information for assessing and monitoring water quality and quantity and thus supports sustainable water management several studies have demonstrated the utility of various remote sensing techniques for quantifying water quality parameters however more needs to be done to exploit the growing number of satellite sensors available to the public the main objective of this study was to evaluate the performances of individual and combined bands of landsat 8 oli sentinel 2 msi aster and spot 6 data as predictors of water quality parameters of open water bodies in a mining area we applied the all subsets regression approach to explore all possible candidate models from which selection was made based on akaike s information criterion aic coefficient of determination adjr2 and root mean squared error rmse two secondary objectives that make use of the products of the all subsets regression approach were added in the study this included comparison of a parsimonious model containing few predictors with the model that was ranked the best but containing more predictors and comparison of models consisting of similar bands across sensors per water quality parameter in general all sensors yielded promising estimation accuracies particularly for sar permanent hardness and cations rmse 50 of observed means sentinel 2 bands produced the best estimations followed by landsat 8 bands for most water quality parameters chiefly due to the greater number of bands these sensors possess compared to aster and spot 6 sensors all sensors provided alternative models that used fewer predicting bands than the best ranked models lowest aic and still showed comparable accuracies with the lowest aic models for most variables pearson s correlation r up to 0 9 sentinel 2 in particular had the most accurate parsimonious models compared to the other sensors pairwise cross sensor comparison of estimation models using similar bands revealed the best matches when a model consisted of blue band only r 0 95 for most parameters while the similarity decreased as the number of predicting bands increased furthermore the best similarities were obtained between sentinel 2 and landsat 8 sensors compared to the other pairs indicating the potential of replacing one in the absence of the other the findings of this study showed the advantage of commonly used remotely sensed data for estimating and by extension monitoring water quality parameters in open water bodies in addition the results revealed that few specific bands carry information relevant to characterise most of the water quality parameters considered in the study we recommend similar studies for different seasons considering the need to monitor water quality throughout the year keywords mooi river water quality parameters multiple remote sensing all subsets regression model comparison 1 introduction the lack of a sustainable management of water bodies in many jurisdictions is a major global concern especially in the face of population growth over utilisation of natural resources and climate change tundisi 2008 garcía et al 2016 kummu et al 2016 poudel and duex 2017 rajsekhar and gorelick 2017 ahmad and haie 2018 furthermore pollution of water bodies due to anthropogenic factors is an important source of water quality degradation owa 2013 inyinbor et al 2018 one such factor is mining as it releases heavy elements into the receiving ground and surface water bodies mccarthy 2011 karmakar and das 2012 durán et al 2013 poswa and davies 2017 soni 2019 if unmonitored residuals such as mine tailings can pose negative environmental risks because of their toxic components and the fact that they comprise particles that can easily enter into water bodies zipper et al 2016 roche et al 2017 mhlongo et al 2018 gilsbach et al 2019 thus monitoring water bodies in mining environments is important for assessing their quality to inform decision making for sustainable water management wang et al 2014 gilsbach et al 2019 water quality monitoring using conventional field based methods is generally regarded as accurate due to the close range observation of water quality parameters nevertheless such an approach is expensive and impractical for monitoring large spatial areas remote sensing on the other hand offers a more convenient alternative as it allows for a wide spatial coverage and repeated measurements in a timely and cost effective manner campbell and wynne 2011 srivastava et al 2014 dörnhöfer and oppelt 2016 guo et al 2017 numerous studies have applied single imagery to assess water quality parameters for example masocha et al 2017 used landsat 8 to quantify secchi disk depth turbidity and chlorophyll a with r2 0 60 karaoui et al 2019 estimated dissolved oxygen nitrate total phosphorus phosphate and chlorophyll a using sentinel 2 at r2 0 52 wang et al 2011 on the other hand applied spot 5 imagery to quantify permanganate index ammonia nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand and reported quite high accuracies r2 0 90 other similar studies that investigated the performance of information extracted from single imagery include alkevli and ercanoglu 2011 aster dlamini et al 2016 modis toming et al 2016 sentinel 2 multispectral imager olmanson et al 2016 landsat 8 and landsat 7 gonzález márquez et al 2018 landsat 8 shi et al shi 2018 worldview 2 and maciel et al 2020 cubesats among others it is difficult to compare the accuracies of different sensors such as those reported above since they made use of different datasets to develop models it is therefore important to compare the relative performance of different remotely sensed data through a comparative analysis applied to the same dataset this has been demonstrated in a number of studies for water body classification purposes e g sivanpillai and miller 2010 duong 2012 yucel and yucel 2014 research is placing a growing interest in the comparison of multiple remote sensing data sources to quantify physical and chemical contents of water bodies for example ouma et al 2018 compared the capabilities of landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus etm eyeonwater and hydrocolor smartphone sensor applications for estimating chlorophyll a turbidity suspended particulate matter and reservoir water colour the comparisons by ouma et al 2018 showed variations in the preference of images for the different sensors although landsat was generally better than the others batur and maktav 2019 demonstrated the similarity of landsat 8 operational land imager oli sentinel 2a and göktürk 2 satellite sensors and principal component analysis pca data fusion and mining techniques for estimating chlorophyll a dissolved oxygen total suspended solids tss secchi disk depth total dissolved substance tds and ph in lake gala turkey such applications are typical examples of the bias toward generic water quality parameters e g secchi depth tss turbidity and vegetation related chlorophyll concentration water treatment efforts targeting multiple pollutants in water bodies such as those in mining environments require quantifying as much constituents as possible in this regard tesfamichael and ndlovu 2018 assessed the suitability of landsat and aster in estimating a number of physical and chemical properties of water bodies within a mining area and reported generally comparable results between the two images the continuous advances in remote sensing are producing a wide range of data that leads to improved information gathering thus there is a need to track and evaluate the performances of such data in an effort to aid in efficient monitoring and management of water qualities this study extends the comparison of multiple sensors by investigating the performance of four space borne remotely sensed datasets including landsat 8 oli the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster sentinel 2 multispectral imager msi and spot 6 images for quantifying water quality parameters as such the study compares more data sources than the previous studies the study applies the all subsets regression approach which allows for exploring all possible models generated from different combinations of predictors this specific regression approach therefore offers the opportunity to add two secondary objectives these include comparing models containing few predictors parsimonious models with those containing more predictors and comparing models developed using similar bands across sensors in order to address these objectives the study was conducted along a river and adjacent wetland systems near mining activities in south africa specifically these mining activities are affecting the quality of water resources and other ecological services of the area fosso kankeu et al 2015 west rand district municipality report 2017 investigating various remote sensing products therefore will allow for the identification of appropriate remote sensing products to use in efficient water quality monitoring systems in the area and elsewhere where mining plays an important environmental and socio economic role 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study was conducted along the mooi river located in the town of carletonville within the south western part of gauteng province south africa fig 1 carletonville was established in the 1930 s and is surrounded by a number of operational and abandoned gold mines most aquatic systems in the district including the water bodies considered in this study are severely polluted or threatened west rand district municipality report 2017 in fact the mooi river which originates from an underground water in an intensively mined location has been documented as one of the river systems with the highest impact on water quality in the area department of water affairs 2011 fosso kankeu et al 2015 the mooi river forms part of the vaal river system that supplies water to many areas including the city of johannesburg the town s geology is dominated by the dolomites of the malmani subgroup clay 1981 agricultural activities occupy a large part of the town s economy however the gold mining industry has left an undesirable footprint on the geophysical environment van eeden 1997 carletonville s landscape is characterised by somewhat rolling plains divided by rocky chert ridges mucina and rutherford 2006 the climatic conditions in carletonville are predominantly warm and temperate the town s mean annual temperature is 15 9 c with an average annual rainfall of 660 mm thus carletonville dolomite grassland falls within a summer rainfall region the study area is characterised by high summer temperatures january and severe frost in winter june mucina and rutherford 2006 2 2 field survey field surveys were conducted during april june 2018 which represents the autumn winter period for the study area department of environmental affairs 2013 generally this season is associated with low photosynthetic activity and vegetation vigour allowing for a clear view of water bodies using remote sensing systems approximate sampling locations were located on google earth at an interval of 100 m stretching for a 12 km segment along the mooi river localized delineation of wetlands along the river from which sampling locations were selected had an area ranging between 737 and 374773 m2 the relatively small interval was specified to accurately represent variations within the entire river system and to collect as many samples as possible however some of the water bodies were inaccessible as they fell within private properties a combination of these factors resulted in 78 accessible sampling locations we believe that this sampling strategy captured the variability present in the water quality parameters along the river a global positioning system gps unit with 3 m accuracy was used to record the position of each sampling point a 250 ml plastic container was used to collect water samples from each sampling location the sampling was restricted to parts of the water bodies where depth was within a meter due to accessibility however nearly all the water bodies had greater depth inward from the edges various physical and chemical contents ph phs sar electrical conductivity fluoride iron nitrate chloride sulphate permanent hardness calcium sodium magnesium potassium phosphate boron and total dissolved solids were quantified from each sample using laboratory analyses carried out by the agricultural research council of south africa table 1 summarises the statistics of the water quality parameters of the samples used in the study most cations for example na k mg ca including ph phs sar and permanent hardness have relatively low variations as indicated by the coefficient of variation cv in contrast most anions show a higher degree of variation and this is particularly pronounced for fe with a cv of 125 0 2 3 remotely sensed data remotely sensed data used in the study included landsat 8 oli aster sentinel 2 msi and spot 6 images acquired during april may 2018 table 2 the image acquisition dates fall within the field survey period and are thus deemed suitable to ensure reliable temporal matching recommended for accurate predictive models bonansea et al 2015 the band regions used in the study are displayed in fig 2 all images had 0 cloud cover and thus we opted not to apply atmospheric correction in order to avoid introducing error in the pixel values bernardo et al 2017 the success of atmospheric correction applied to areas associated with inland water bodies remain sub optimal bernardo et al 2017 ilori et al 2019 understandably due to the continental effect on such water bodies palmer et al 2015 in addition atmospheric correction can have differential effects on individual bands as illustrated using sentinel 2 msi imagery by doxani et al 2018 and using landsat 8 oli and sentinel 2 msi by de keukelaere et al 2018 in an effort to ensure the quality of the images we compared the landsat data used in the study against readily available atmospherically corrected landsat surface reflectance data processed by earth resources observation and science eros center using the landsurface reflectance code lasrc algorithm the comparison between these datasets did not show significant differences the number of bands used in the study varied for the different sensors with sentinel 2 msi having the largest number of bands n 13 although aster imagery can have up to 14 bands the imagery used in the study only consisted of the bands in the visible and near infrared vnir regions of the electromagnetic energy bands 1 to 3 with a 15 m resolution bands in the shortwave infrared swir region bands 4 to 9 and thermal infrared tir region bands 10 to 14 were unavailable for the specific study period pixel values of all downloaded images were represented by digital numbers dns these dns were calibrated to reflectance values using calibration factors given with the respective images the landsat sentinel and aster images were resampled to 10 m resolution using nearest neighbour resampling to narrow the scale mismatch between the sensors the impact of the resampling is lower or insignificant for landsat and sentinel since they have pixel dimensions that are perfectly divisible by 10 while we believe the nearest neighbour resampling approach maintains the integrity of the original data for aster images that had a 15 m resolution following the resampling a 15 m buffer was created about each field sampling point and overlaid on the individual bands of the four images subsequently the buffers served to compute the mean reflectance values of each band the mean reflectance data and the laboratory analysed data were then correlated using regression analysis as described in section 2 4 2 4 statistical analysis a regression analysis that creates all possible models that predict water quality parameters was used in the study each of the laboratory analysed physical and chemical properties was used as a dependent variable while the spatially averaged reflectance of individual bands of landsat 8 aster sentinel 2 and spot 6 bands served as predictors the number of models created using the all subsets regression approach by relating each dependent variable with the reflectance values of bands is quantified as 2n 1 for n number of independent variables or bands substituting 4 in the equation for n for spot imagery for instance results in 15 models these models include models consisting of single variables models consisting of any two variables models consisting of any three variables and a model containing all four variables as predictors in order to reduce the number of candidate models and simplify the evaluation process we assumed that models containing an equal number of predictor s were comparable we therefore selected the best model per group of predictors one best model containing one predictor one best model containing two predictors one best model containing three predictors and so on until the maximum number of predictors was reached this selection process resulted in seven candidate models for landsat 13 models for sentinel three models for aster and four models for spot the reduced number of models was subsequently ranked using akaike information criterion aic followed by comparisons using adjusted coefficient of determination adjr2 and root mean squared error rmse per imagery type the aic statistic measures the difference also referred to as distance between the best model and the ideal but unobservable model that generated the data burnham and anderson 2002 a model that has the lowest aic is considered closest to the ideal model while model preference decreases as the aic increases it should be noted that the aic is not used to evaluate the absolute quality of a model instead it helps to compare the relative proximity of two or more models to the ideal model as a consensus models separated by 10 aic units are said to be comparable with each other although this restriction can be relaxed for practical reasons burnham and anderson 2002 the adjr2 indicates the degree of association between the predictor and independent variables with model preference increasing with an increase in adjr2 this statistic was preferred to the standard r2 since it adjusts for the number of predictors in a model by penalising for every predictor added in a model the rmse eq 1 provides a reliable indication of model accuracy since it compares the observed and modelled data of each sample 1 rmse i 1 n observed i predicted i 2 n where n is the total number of observations model accuracy is inversely related to rmse values as such the higher the rmse the lower the accuracy it is also important to compare models based on the parsimony principle favouring simpler models with fewer predictors while maintaining model accuracy to support the implementation of model simplicity we compared the estimation errors of the best model that had the lowest aic value with the other comparable models consisting of fewer variables than the best model this approach specifically shows the magnitude and direction of estimation errors of comparable models and thus indicates if the comparable errors are random or systematic the comparison in this regard was made using simple pearson s correlation analysis consequently the higher the correlation the greater the similarity between the models all the spatial analyses that prepared the spatial data were carried out in arcgis esri version 10 6 1 redlands ca usa and the regression analysis was undertaken in the number cruncher statistical system ncss version 12 llc usa 2 5 comparison of models across sensors using similar bands we compared water quality parameters estimated using similar bands of the different sensors used in the study this comparison was intended to evaluate the level of agreement in the modelling capabilities of sensors given similar bands a key envisaged advantage of this analysis is that it gives us an indication of the level of confidence of using an alternative image in the absence of preferred imagery claverie et al 2018 chastain et al 2019 it was assumed in this study that the atmospheric conditions did not have a significant influence on the variation between the pixel reflectance values we also did not consider the short time difference in data acquisition 20 april 25 may would have a major effect on the data variation besides the entire time period falls within the same season department of environmental affairs 2013 under this assumption bandwidths become a major source of variation in pixel values claverie et al 2018 the comparisons were made across the number of predicting bands accordingly models developed using a single and similar band of each sensor were compared against each other such comparison was repeated for models containing the same number and type of bands respectively the bands used in the comparisons were specified by identifying those that were used most frequently in estimation models with the lowest aic values pairwise pearson s correlation coefficient was used in the comparisons of fitted values between sensors 3 results 3 1 performances of landsat 8 oli aster sentinel 2 msi and spot 6 goodness of fit statistics for the best case smallest aic values to estimate each water quality parameter using landsat 8 aster sentinel 2 and spot 6 images are shown in fig 3 the number of predicting bands in the model with the smallest aic values ranged from 1 to 5 for landsat 1 2 for aster 1 8 for sentinel and 1 3 for spot ten parameters were estimated using a single band in the case of aster followed by landsat which yielded single band models for five parameters the best models for sentinel had three or more bands as predictors except for no3 and cl which were estimated using one and two predictors respectively it is noteworthy to compare the number of predictors against the total number of bands of each image for example nine water quality parameters were estimated by models containing five or more bands as predictors using sentinel that had 13 bands in contrast nearly all water quality parameters estimated using landsat bands had four or fewer predictors as compared to the seven bands of the imagery performances according to adjr2 varied between 0 1 rmse 99 1 e g ph tds and 0 51 rmse 3 1 for sar when landsat data were used in general estimation accuracies for anions e g f cl were low with adjr2 0 2 and rmse 50 except for so4 2 that returned rmse of 38 1 fig 3 estimations using aster bands produced accuracy patterns similar to landsat for example anions had lower estimation accuracies compared to landsat based estimation aster showed significantly better accuracy for sar estimation adjr2 0 62 rmse 2 8 than for the other water quality parameters sentinel returned models that are generally more accurate than the other images with boron permanent hardness and sar having adjr2 exceeding 0 55 although rmse of boron was high relative to those for the other two water quality parameters similarly ca had significantly better accuracy when estimated using sentinel than the other images spot 6 bands had generally lower accuracies than the other images in estimating all water quality parameters fig 4 illustrates the relationships between the observed and predicted values of water quality parameters estimated using the best case lowest aic models and each image there was generally good agreement between the model fit statistics given in fig 3 and the plots comparing observed and estimated values accordingly sar estimates reproduced observed values quite well across the entire range of values using all images similarly good observed vs estimated permanent hardness correlations are noted particularly for the sentinel image magnesium had low estimation accuracy by all images up to approximately 34 mg l where the estimates were either constant or lacking clear variations to match the variations in the observation magnesium estimates were noticeably accurate beyond 34 mg l similarly calcium estimation was rather poor up to 75 mg l beyond which showed noticeable improvement in contrast to magnesium and calcium sodium and potassium estimates showed variations that followed the variations of observed values however there was an overall underestimation across the range of values for each element goodness of fit statistics particularly adjr2 values of boron presented in fig 3 show moderate accuracies relative to other water quality parameters however the observed vs estimated boron values plotted in fig 4 show the limited number of unique values in the observation dataset with only five unique values above 0 05 mg l such limited values do not agree well with the estimated values resulting in the high rmse values 25 shown in fig 3 it is useful to compare the frequency of band usage in estimating the water quality parameters in order to highlight the contributions of bands fig 5 depicts the total number of times each band appeared in models to estimate all parameters the frequency represents the total count of each band included in the models identified as having the best in terms of aic ranking for example three bands of aster data provide three best models per water quality parameter one using a single band one using two bands and one using three bands as predictors a band of aster image therefore may appear in any number of these models for estimating each variable the red and nir bands had high frequencies in all sensors similarly the blue band also had high frequencies in landsat sentinel and spot images while this band was not available in aster for this study the coastal blue band was also used frequently however this band is currently available only in landsat and sentinel data of the four images considered in the study 3 2 comparability of lowest aic model with a parsimonious model models reported in the above sections represent lowest aic values and in most cases included two or more spectral bands as predictors we compared these models against a parsimonious model that used fewer predictor bands we adopted two rules in selecting a model as a candidate for comparison with the lowest aic model firstly following our observations of all the models we specified the candidate model to be within 15 aic units of the lowest aic model secondly we selected the model that has the lowest number of predictors among candidate models within the 15 aic unit fig 6 a shows the correlation between the lowest aic model and the model that met the two rules defined above per water quality parameter it should be noted that the comparison was not applied to a model that had the lowest aic value and contained only one predicting band for example eight water quality parameters were estimated by models with lowest aic values using a single band of aster imagery as the predictor and therefore no alternative parsimonious models were sought for these parameters the pearson correlation coefficient between the best model and comparable parsimonious model varied between 0 41 for phs and 0 97 for magnesium when aster was used for landsat the correlation between the best model and comparable parsimonious models varied between r 0 6 for ph and 0 98 for sar weak correlations were also observed for comparable models particularly for estimating ph and iron using spot images in general favourable comparisons were obtained for sentinel based models except for the estimation of magnesium r 0 25 a notable observation from the correlations is the similarity in competing models among sensors for estimating certain parameters for example all sensors provided highly comparable models r 0 8 for estimating sar fig 6a a similar observation can also be made for ec permanent hardness and k in contrast considerable correlation differences among sensors are noted for a number of parameters such as ph fe and f in which sentinel yielded the most correlated competing models similarly all sensors except sentinel produced well correlated competing models r 0 7 to estimate mg it should be noted that good correlations between candidate models do not necessarily imply good estimation accuracies for example the competing models developed from landsat were accurate relative to observed sar too fig 6b on the other hand the competing models for estimating k using spot data had a high correlation against each other r 0 77 but both were poor against observed values fig 6c such high comparability among estimates of competing models but low accuracy against the truth observed data were observed for estimating f using sentinel fig 6d and so4 2 using aster fig 6e 3 3 cross sensor comparison using matching bands sensors were compared using estimates quantified by models containing similar bands such as blue band based models of all sensors the comparison therefore was limited to images containing common bands that were used frequently to estimate most of the water quality parameters accordingly we decided to use landsat sentinel and spot images containing the visible and infrared bands that were part of most models in the three images fig 5 in contrast the aster image lacked the blue band and therefore was excluded from the comparison results of the comparisons using landsat sentinel and spot images and pearson s correlation r are presented in fig 7 three distinct observations can be made from the comparisons firstly models generated using the blue band as a single predictor in each imagery have the greatest similarity across sensors to estimate all the water quality parameters except ca for example all pairwise correlations between the three sensors for estimating cl b sar na tds k fe and no3 exceeded 0 95 secondly pairwise sensor similarities generally decreased as the number of predictor variables used in a model increased thirdly the greatest similarity was observed mostly between landsat and sentinel sensors across the number of predictors used in the models the differences in the correlations of landsat sentinel and the other pairs tended to increase as the number of predictors increased that is the landsat sentinel correlation was comparable to the landsat spot and sentinel spot correlations when using a one variable model blue band based model while the differences in the correlations between sensors were greater for models that made use of two or more bands this can be observed for a number of estimations such as cl phs and so4 among others 4 discussion 4 1 overall accuracies of aster landsat 8 oli sentinel 2 msi and spot 6 this study sought to assess the performances of four satellite image data including landsat 8 oli aster sentinel 2 msi and spot 6 in quantifying water quality parameters within a mining area specifically we targeted three objectives 1 evaluating the performances of best estimation models derived from the four images irrespective of the predicting bands used in the models 2 comparing models containing fewer predictors with those obtained in objective 1 and 3 comparing models developed using similar bands across sensors to determine the level of reproducibility of accuracy across sensors the all subsets regression method was used to achieve our objectives by relating 17 water quality parameters and reflectance values of visible and infrared bands available in the satellite images this regression approach was preferred because it yields all possible models and thus serves as an exploratory as well as a predictive tool the resultant model comparisons within and across sensors are therefore exhaustive and looks at all alternative models compared to other approaches that generate a single best model based on a certain statistical significance applying such a modelling approach is justifiable for water quality modelling which is known to vary greatly with factors such as type of remote sensing data and sampling design liu et al 2003 in general the ability to estimate water quality parameters using each sensor was encouraging for a number of water quality parameters such as sar permanent hardness and cations with a relative rmse of 50 while it was less accurate for anions fig 3 these findings are comparable to tesfamichael and ndlovu 2018 who focussed on some water quality parameters like in the current study using landsat and aster it should be noted that the samples used by tesfamichael and ndlovu were fewer n 31 compared to 78 in the current study and spread over a larger spatial area than the current study resulting in a great deal of variation in values in light of this our results based on relatively low data variations were impressive and indicate the value of remote sensing at such a local scale this bodes well for the assessment of water quality risks within mining environments where multiple interdependent factors induce localized variations gilsbach et al 2019 karaoui et al 2019 used sentinel 2 msi data to estimate nitrate and phosphate at r2 of 0 67 and 0 54 respectively these accuracies were better than our results r2 0 50 for both variables fig 3 however karaoui et al took samples well inside the water reservoir focus of their study to avoid inclusion of spectral reflectance from the reservoir bottom thereby minimizing sources of uncertainty in contrast the samples used in our study were drawn from relatively shallow water bodies and therefore the images from these sampling locations could contain reflectance from the bottom of the water bodies as well mushtaq and lala 2017 reported r2 of 0 36 0 73 for different water quality parameters including ph hardness cl ec and phosphate using landsat oli applied to 11 samples it is nonetheless important to recognize the rather low graphical correlations between spectra and many of the water quality parameters nonetheless these studies concur with ours in showing the suitability of sentinel 2 msi sensor in water quality assessments relative comparison among the sensors shows the superiority of sentinel followed by landsat data according to the performances of models that returned the lowest aic figs 3 and 4 previous studies such as manzo et al 2015 and yadav et al 2019 have also shown the superiority of sentinel msi to landsat data in different water quality modelling efforts the relative comparability between sentinel msi and landsat in our study is attributed to the largely similar number and characteristics of bands they possess fig 2b and c the spectral similarities between the two images were also shown by chastain et al 2019 using analysis of data for the conterminous united states of america in addition it is important to note the closeness of acquisition dates of landsat and sentinel data both of which fell within the same month table 2 the superiority of landsat and sentinel msi to aster and spot 6 sensors fig 3 is justified given the number of spectral bands they possess and the modelling approach used in the study that is the all subsets regression approach does not restrict the number of bands that can be incorporated in the best model with the lowest aic value the approach therefore should logically work well for images that have a large number of bands to choose from burnham and anderson 2002 even so aster based models had promising accuracies despite the limited total number of bands n 3 used to generate candidate models indicating the relative suitability of few spectral bands available in all the four images this specific argument was corroborated by the fact that the most frequently used bands to build models for estimating the water quality parameters were somehow similar across sensors fig 5 the relatively weaker estimation accuracies obtained using spot 6 than sentinel and landsat data in the present study can be indicative of the advantage of spectral detail over spatial resolution it should however be noted that this observation may apply to the same spatial scale sampling interval and water quality characteristics as those used in the current study 4 2 focus on parsimonious models one of the benefits of the all subsets regression approach is the opportunity it offers for direct comparison of multiple models differing in predictor size but all developed from a given sample set this by extension is useful to evaluate the goodness of a simplified model compared to a complex model that contains many predictors burnham and anderson 2002 for each water quality parameter a parsimonious model was selected if it used a small number of predictors and was within a distance of 15 aic units from the model that had the lowest aic statistic most of the water quality parameters could be estimated by one or two bands of a sensor and would produce results comparable to the model that had the lowest aic fig 6 it is important to note that such comparability applies irrespective of accuracy against the observed values that is two or more comparable models can have equally good or unsatisfactory estimation accuracies this shows that rather few bands are sufficient to capture the variations in water quality parameters using the sensors considered in the study however the relative comparison among sensors in general shows greater similarities between the parsimonious and the lowest aic models for most water quality parameters for sentinel 2 msi than for other sensors fig 6 this is specifically significant considering the originally high number of predictors that yielded the lowest aic values for sentinel based models fig 3 having alternative models afforded by all subsets regression is logically advantageous particularly when there is uncertainty in the quality of information carried by certain bands for example atmospheric interferences are common over inland water bodies due to constituents such as phytoplankton and particulate matters associated with continental bodies siegel et al 2000 palmer et al 2015 such interferences affect bands differently doxani et al 2018 de keukelaere et al 2018 and thus the signal to noise ratio of affected bands can be too low for valid retrieval of water quality 4 3 sensor comparison using similar bands the all subsets regression approach allows us to make a direct comparison between models created from similar bands this opportunity should therefore be exploited to provide an indication of the reproducibility of results using different sensors with similar bands pairwise sensor comparisons landsat vs sentinel landsat vs spot sentinel vs spot showed that similarity among sensors was greatest when a single band blue was used while the similarity generally decreased as the number of predictors increased fig 7 this is attributed to the fact that the use of a single band e g blue for all sensors limits the discrepancy in estimation accuracy error even if the bandwidth or band edges may differ for the four sensors fig 2 in contrast the decreasing similarity across sensors as the number of predictors per model increases can logically be attributed to the combined effects of differences in bandwidth and band edges among sensors another key observation in the pairwise comparison between sensors revealed the greatest similarity between landsat 8 and sentinel 2 data this was not surprising since the two images share a certain level of similarities in terms of band compositions and reflectance properties mandanici and bitelli 2016 chastain et al 2019 the similarity in the performance of the landsat and sentinel multispectral sensors is encouraging in light of the continuous efforts to harmonize products of the two sensors as part of achieving seamless data claverie et al 2018 4 4 a note on the timeliness of remotely sensed data our study used field survey and remotely sensed data acquired within the same season in the study areas table 2 and thus we assumed the time window to be acceptable for direct comparison between the two data sets this assumption can also hold considering the river of interest pass through wetland systems that have a stabilizing effect on the extent and qualities of the water that is the water qualities are believed to remain unchanged for a certain period of time in comparison with continuously flowing water as encountered in strictly traditional river systems however any study focussed on characterizing a river system such as ours should ideally narrow the data acquisition time window this study unfortunately relied on remotely sensed data with temporal resolutions that did not necessarily coincide within the ideal time window of the field survey it is therefore important to be cautious in the interpretation of the findings although we used an all subsets regression approach that inherently allows for an exhaustive comparison of all possible estimation models burnham and anderson 2002 we therefore encourage more temporally pointed data acquisitions when assessing water quality of river systems timeliness becomes even vital when a routine monitoring for efficient sustainable management of rivers is the intended goal of applying remote sensing techniques in this regard high temporal resolution remotely sensed data sources such as customized aerial and drone surveys can be considered as practical alternatives furthermore calibration of spectral information between sensors acquired at staggered times such as between sentinel and landsat does improve temporal resolutions claverie et al 2018 and thus is expected to provide a cost free water quality monitoring support 5 conclusions the present study assessed the performances of aster landsat 8 sentinel 2 and spot 6 images to estimate water quality parameters in a mining area in general estimations were promising for certain water quality parameters such as sar permanent hardness and cations using all sensors a comparative observation of the four data sources showed sentinel 2 to be marginally the best followed closely by landsat data for estimating most of the water quality parameters due to the large number of bands these images could contribute to model development figs 3 and 4 comparability of model performances derived from sentinel and landsat is also attributed to the spectral similarity between the two images the similarities between the two sensors remained the strongest when models were generated using similar bands in both models e g blue band based models of the two images fig 7 these findings coupled with design efforts to harmonize sentinel and landsat point towards the complementary usage of these images for water quality monitoring the application of the all subsets regression in this study allowed for direct comparisons of several models one advantage in this regard was to evaluate models that use different predictors the study showed the comparability of original model that contained 2 predicting bands with those that have less predictors for each image fig 6 identifying the optimal parsimonious model and the predictors therein is helpful in focussing on bands with limited atmospheric effect finally our study used data acquired in the winter season when water bodies were clearly identifiable by earth observation sensors it is important to extend such a study to the other seasons and ultimately to a year round

5065,population growth and associated anthropogenic activities such as mining are posing a major threat to water resources remote sensing provides valuable information for assessing and monitoring water quality and quantity and thus supports sustainable water management several studies have demonstrated the utility of various remote sensing techniques for quantifying water quality parameters however more needs to be done to exploit the growing number of satellite sensors available to the public the main objective of this study was to evaluate the performances of individual and combined bands of landsat 8 oli sentinel 2 msi aster and spot 6 data as predictors of water quality parameters of open water bodies in a mining area we applied the all subsets regression approach to explore all possible candidate models from which selection was made based on akaike s information criterion aic coefficient of determination adjr2 and root mean squared error rmse two secondary objectives that make use of the products of the all subsets regression approach were added in the study this included comparison of a parsimonious model containing few predictors with the model that was ranked the best but containing more predictors and comparison of models consisting of similar bands across sensors per water quality parameter in general all sensors yielded promising estimation accuracies particularly for sar permanent hardness and cations rmse 50 of observed means sentinel 2 bands produced the best estimations followed by landsat 8 bands for most water quality parameters chiefly due to the greater number of bands these sensors possess compared to aster and spot 6 sensors all sensors provided alternative models that used fewer predicting bands than the best ranked models lowest aic and still showed comparable accuracies with the lowest aic models for most variables pearson s correlation r up to 0 9 sentinel 2 in particular had the most accurate parsimonious models compared to the other sensors pairwise cross sensor comparison of estimation models using similar bands revealed the best matches when a model consisted of blue band only r 0 95 for most parameters while the similarity decreased as the number of predicting bands increased furthermore the best similarities were obtained between sentinel 2 and landsat 8 sensors compared to the other pairs indicating the potential of replacing one in the absence of the other the findings of this study showed the advantage of commonly used remotely sensed data for estimating and by extension monitoring water quality parameters in open water bodies in addition the results revealed that few specific bands carry information relevant to characterise most of the water quality parameters considered in the study we recommend similar studies for different seasons considering the need to monitor water quality throughout the year keywords mooi river water quality parameters multiple remote sensing all subsets regression model comparison 1 introduction the lack of a sustainable management of water bodies in many jurisdictions is a major global concern especially in the face of population growth over utilisation of natural resources and climate change tundisi 2008 garcía et al 2016 kummu et al 2016 poudel and duex 2017 rajsekhar and gorelick 2017 ahmad and haie 2018 furthermore pollution of water bodies due to anthropogenic factors is an important source of water quality degradation owa 2013 inyinbor et al 2018 one such factor is mining as it releases heavy elements into the receiving ground and surface water bodies mccarthy 2011 karmakar and das 2012 durán et al 2013 poswa and davies 2017 soni 2019 if unmonitored residuals such as mine tailings can pose negative environmental risks because of their toxic components and the fact that they comprise particles that can easily enter into water bodies zipper et al 2016 roche et al 2017 mhlongo et al 2018 gilsbach et al 2019 thus monitoring water bodies in mining environments is important for assessing their quality to inform decision making for sustainable water management wang et al 2014 gilsbach et al 2019 water quality monitoring using conventional field based methods is generally regarded as accurate due to the close range observation of water quality parameters nevertheless such an approach is expensive and impractical for monitoring large spatial areas remote sensing on the other hand offers a more convenient alternative as it allows for a wide spatial coverage and repeated measurements in a timely and cost effective manner campbell and wynne 2011 srivastava et al 2014 dörnhöfer and oppelt 2016 guo et al 2017 numerous studies have applied single imagery to assess water quality parameters for example masocha et al 2017 used landsat 8 to quantify secchi disk depth turbidity and chlorophyll a with r2 0 60 karaoui et al 2019 estimated dissolved oxygen nitrate total phosphorus phosphate and chlorophyll a using sentinel 2 at r2 0 52 wang et al 2011 on the other hand applied spot 5 imagery to quantify permanganate index ammonia nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand and reported quite high accuracies r2 0 90 other similar studies that investigated the performance of information extracted from single imagery include alkevli and ercanoglu 2011 aster dlamini et al 2016 modis toming et al 2016 sentinel 2 multispectral imager olmanson et al 2016 landsat 8 and landsat 7 gonzález márquez et al 2018 landsat 8 shi et al shi 2018 worldview 2 and maciel et al 2020 cubesats among others it is difficult to compare the accuracies of different sensors such as those reported above since they made use of different datasets to develop models it is therefore important to compare the relative performance of different remotely sensed data through a comparative analysis applied to the same dataset this has been demonstrated in a number of studies for water body classification purposes e g sivanpillai and miller 2010 duong 2012 yucel and yucel 2014 research is placing a growing interest in the comparison of multiple remote sensing data sources to quantify physical and chemical contents of water bodies for example ouma et al 2018 compared the capabilities of landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus etm eyeonwater and hydrocolor smartphone sensor applications for estimating chlorophyll a turbidity suspended particulate matter and reservoir water colour the comparisons by ouma et al 2018 showed variations in the preference of images for the different sensors although landsat was generally better than the others batur and maktav 2019 demonstrated the similarity of landsat 8 operational land imager oli sentinel 2a and göktürk 2 satellite sensors and principal component analysis pca data fusion and mining techniques for estimating chlorophyll a dissolved oxygen total suspended solids tss secchi disk depth total dissolved substance tds and ph in lake gala turkey such applications are typical examples of the bias toward generic water quality parameters e g secchi depth tss turbidity and vegetation related chlorophyll concentration water treatment efforts targeting multiple pollutants in water bodies such as those in mining environments require quantifying as much constituents as possible in this regard tesfamichael and ndlovu 2018 assessed the suitability of landsat and aster in estimating a number of physical and chemical properties of water bodies within a mining area and reported generally comparable results between the two images the continuous advances in remote sensing are producing a wide range of data that leads to improved information gathering thus there is a need to track and evaluate the performances of such data in an effort to aid in efficient monitoring and management of water qualities this study extends the comparison of multiple sensors by investigating the performance of four space borne remotely sensed datasets including landsat 8 oli the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster sentinel 2 multispectral imager msi and spot 6 images for quantifying water quality parameters as such the study compares more data sources than the previous studies the study applies the all subsets regression approach which allows for exploring all possible models generated from different combinations of predictors this specific regression approach therefore offers the opportunity to add two secondary objectives these include comparing models containing few predictors parsimonious models with those containing more predictors and comparing models developed using similar bands across sensors in order to address these objectives the study was conducted along a river and adjacent wetland systems near mining activities in south africa specifically these mining activities are affecting the quality of water resources and other ecological services of the area fosso kankeu et al 2015 west rand district municipality report 2017 investigating various remote sensing products therefore will allow for the identification of appropriate remote sensing products to use in efficient water quality monitoring systems in the area and elsewhere where mining plays an important environmental and socio economic role 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study was conducted along the mooi river located in the town of carletonville within the south western part of gauteng province south africa fig 1 carletonville was established in the 1930 s and is surrounded by a number of operational and abandoned gold mines most aquatic systems in the district including the water bodies considered in this study are severely polluted or threatened west rand district municipality report 2017 in fact the mooi river which originates from an underground water in an intensively mined location has been documented as one of the river systems with the highest impact on water quality in the area department of water affairs 2011 fosso kankeu et al 2015 the mooi river forms part of the vaal river system that supplies water to many areas including the city of johannesburg the town s geology is dominated by the dolomites of the malmani subgroup clay 1981 agricultural activities occupy a large part of the town s economy however the gold mining industry has left an undesirable footprint on the geophysical environment van eeden 1997 carletonville s landscape is characterised by somewhat rolling plains divided by rocky chert ridges mucina and rutherford 2006 the climatic conditions in carletonville are predominantly warm and temperate the town s mean annual temperature is 15 9 c with an average annual rainfall of 660 mm thus carletonville dolomite grassland falls within a summer rainfall region the study area is characterised by high summer temperatures january and severe frost in winter june mucina and rutherford 2006 2 2 field survey field surveys were conducted during april june 2018 which represents the autumn winter period for the study area department of environmental affairs 2013 generally this season is associated with low photosynthetic activity and vegetation vigour allowing for a clear view of water bodies using remote sensing systems approximate sampling locations were located on google earth at an interval of 100 m stretching for a 12 km segment along the mooi river localized delineation of wetlands along the river from which sampling locations were selected had an area ranging between 737 and 374773 m2 the relatively small interval was specified to accurately represent variations within the entire river system and to collect as many samples as possible however some of the water bodies were inaccessible as they fell within private properties a combination of these factors resulted in 78 accessible sampling locations we believe that this sampling strategy captured the variability present in the water quality parameters along the river a global positioning system gps unit with 3 m accuracy was used to record the position of each sampling point a 250 ml plastic container was used to collect water samples from each sampling location the sampling was restricted to parts of the water bodies where depth was within a meter due to accessibility however nearly all the water bodies had greater depth inward from the edges various physical and chemical contents ph phs sar electrical conductivity fluoride iron nitrate chloride sulphate permanent hardness calcium sodium magnesium potassium phosphate boron and total dissolved solids were quantified from each sample using laboratory analyses carried out by the agricultural research council of south africa table 1 summarises the statistics of the water quality parameters of the samples used in the study most cations for example na k mg ca including ph phs sar and permanent hardness have relatively low variations as indicated by the coefficient of variation cv in contrast most anions show a higher degree of variation and this is particularly pronounced for fe with a cv of 125 0 2 3 remotely sensed data remotely sensed data used in the study included landsat 8 oli aster sentinel 2 msi and spot 6 images acquired during april may 2018 table 2 the image acquisition dates fall within the field survey period and are thus deemed suitable to ensure reliable temporal matching recommended for accurate predictive models bonansea et al 2015 the band regions used in the study are displayed in fig 2 all images had 0 cloud cover and thus we opted not to apply atmospheric correction in order to avoid introducing error in the pixel values bernardo et al 2017 the success of atmospheric correction applied to areas associated with inland water bodies remain sub optimal bernardo et al 2017 ilori et al 2019 understandably due to the continental effect on such water bodies palmer et al 2015 in addition atmospheric correction can have differential effects on individual bands as illustrated using sentinel 2 msi imagery by doxani et al 2018 and using landsat 8 oli and sentinel 2 msi by de keukelaere et al 2018 in an effort to ensure the quality of the images we compared the landsat data used in the study against readily available atmospherically corrected landsat surface reflectance data processed by earth resources observation and science eros center using the landsurface reflectance code lasrc algorithm the comparison between these datasets did not show significant differences the number of bands used in the study varied for the different sensors with sentinel 2 msi having the largest number of bands n 13 although aster imagery can have up to 14 bands the imagery used in the study only consisted of the bands in the visible and near infrared vnir regions of the electromagnetic energy bands 1 to 3 with a 15 m resolution bands in the shortwave infrared swir region bands 4 to 9 and thermal infrared tir region bands 10 to 14 were unavailable for the specific study period pixel values of all downloaded images were represented by digital numbers dns these dns were calibrated to reflectance values using calibration factors given with the respective images the landsat sentinel and aster images were resampled to 10 m resolution using nearest neighbour resampling to narrow the scale mismatch between the sensors the impact of the resampling is lower or insignificant for landsat and sentinel since they have pixel dimensions that are perfectly divisible by 10 while we believe the nearest neighbour resampling approach maintains the integrity of the original data for aster images that had a 15 m resolution following the resampling a 15 m buffer was created about each field sampling point and overlaid on the individual bands of the four images subsequently the buffers served to compute the mean reflectance values of each band the mean reflectance data and the laboratory analysed data were then correlated using regression analysis as described in section 2 4 2 4 statistical analysis a regression analysis that creates all possible models that predict water quality parameters was used in the study each of the laboratory analysed physical and chemical properties was used as a dependent variable while the spatially averaged reflectance of individual bands of landsat 8 aster sentinel 2 and spot 6 bands served as predictors the number of models created using the all subsets regression approach by relating each dependent variable with the reflectance values of bands is quantified as 2n 1 for n number of independent variables or bands substituting 4 in the equation for n for spot imagery for instance results in 15 models these models include models consisting of single variables models consisting of any two variables models consisting of any three variables and a model containing all four variables as predictors in order to reduce the number of candidate models and simplify the evaluation process we assumed that models containing an equal number of predictor s were comparable we therefore selected the best model per group of predictors one best model containing one predictor one best model containing two predictors one best model containing three predictors and so on until the maximum number of predictors was reached this selection process resulted in seven candidate models for landsat 13 models for sentinel three models for aster and four models for spot the reduced number of models was subsequently ranked using akaike information criterion aic followed by comparisons using adjusted coefficient of determination adjr2 and root mean squared error rmse per imagery type the aic statistic measures the difference also referred to as distance between the best model and the ideal but unobservable model that generated the data burnham and anderson 2002 a model that has the lowest aic is considered closest to the ideal model while model preference decreases as the aic increases it should be noted that the aic is not used to evaluate the absolute quality of a model instead it helps to compare the relative proximity of two or more models to the ideal model as a consensus models separated by 10 aic units are said to be comparable with each other although this restriction can be relaxed for practical reasons burnham and anderson 2002 the adjr2 indicates the degree of association between the predictor and independent variables with model preference increasing with an increase in adjr2 this statistic was preferred to the standard r2 since it adjusts for the number of predictors in a model by penalising for every predictor added in a model the rmse eq 1 provides a reliable indication of model accuracy since it compares the observed and modelled data of each sample 1 rmse i 1 n observed i predicted i 2 n where n is the total number of observations model accuracy is inversely related to rmse values as such the higher the rmse the lower the accuracy it is also important to compare models based on the parsimony principle favouring simpler models with fewer predictors while maintaining model accuracy to support the implementation of model simplicity we compared the estimation errors of the best model that had the lowest aic value with the other comparable models consisting of fewer variables than the best model this approach specifically shows the magnitude and direction of estimation errors of comparable models and thus indicates if the comparable errors are random or systematic the comparison in this regard was made using simple pearson s correlation analysis consequently the higher the correlation the greater the similarity between the models all the spatial analyses that prepared the spatial data were carried out in arcgis esri version 10 6 1 redlands ca usa and the regression analysis was undertaken in the number cruncher statistical system ncss version 12 llc usa 2 5 comparison of models across sensors using similar bands we compared water quality parameters estimated using similar bands of the different sensors used in the study this comparison was intended to evaluate the level of agreement in the modelling capabilities of sensors given similar bands a key envisaged advantage of this analysis is that it gives us an indication of the level of confidence of using an alternative image in the absence of preferred imagery claverie et al 2018 chastain et al 2019 it was assumed in this study that the atmospheric conditions did not have a significant influence on the variation between the pixel reflectance values we also did not consider the short time difference in data acquisition 20 april 25 may would have a major effect on the data variation besides the entire time period falls within the same season department of environmental affairs 2013 under this assumption bandwidths become a major source of variation in pixel values claverie et al 2018 the comparisons were made across the number of predicting bands accordingly models developed using a single and similar band of each sensor were compared against each other such comparison was repeated for models containing the same number and type of bands respectively the bands used in the comparisons were specified by identifying those that were used most frequently in estimation models with the lowest aic values pairwise pearson s correlation coefficient was used in the comparisons of fitted values between sensors 3 results 3 1 performances of landsat 8 oli aster sentinel 2 msi and spot 6 goodness of fit statistics for the best case smallest aic values to estimate each water quality parameter using landsat 8 aster sentinel 2 and spot 6 images are shown in fig 3 the number of predicting bands in the model with the smallest aic values ranged from 1 to 5 for landsat 1 2 for aster 1 8 for sentinel and 1 3 for spot ten parameters were estimated using a single band in the case of aster followed by landsat which yielded single band models for five parameters the best models for sentinel had three or more bands as predictors except for no3 and cl which were estimated using one and two predictors respectively it is noteworthy to compare the number of predictors against the total number of bands of each image for example nine water quality parameters were estimated by models containing five or more bands as predictors using sentinel that had 13 bands in contrast nearly all water quality parameters estimated using landsat bands had four or fewer predictors as compared to the seven bands of the imagery performances according to adjr2 varied between 0 1 rmse 99 1 e g ph tds and 0 51 rmse 3 1 for sar when landsat data were used in general estimation accuracies for anions e g f cl were low with adjr2 0 2 and rmse 50 except for so4 2 that returned rmse of 38 1 fig 3 estimations using aster bands produced accuracy patterns similar to landsat for example anions had lower estimation accuracies compared to landsat based estimation aster showed significantly better accuracy for sar estimation adjr2 0 62 rmse 2 8 than for the other water quality parameters sentinel returned models that are generally more accurate than the other images with boron permanent hardness and sar having adjr2 exceeding 0 55 although rmse of boron was high relative to those for the other two water quality parameters similarly ca had significantly better accuracy when estimated using sentinel than the other images spot 6 bands had generally lower accuracies than the other images in estimating all water quality parameters fig 4 illustrates the relationships between the observed and predicted values of water quality parameters estimated using the best case lowest aic models and each image there was generally good agreement between the model fit statistics given in fig 3 and the plots comparing observed and estimated values accordingly sar estimates reproduced observed values quite well across the entire range of values using all images similarly good observed vs estimated permanent hardness correlations are noted particularly for the sentinel image magnesium had low estimation accuracy by all images up to approximately 34 mg l where the estimates were either constant or lacking clear variations to match the variations in the observation magnesium estimates were noticeably accurate beyond 34 mg l similarly calcium estimation was rather poor up to 75 mg l beyond which showed noticeable improvement in contrast to magnesium and calcium sodium and potassium estimates showed variations that followed the variations of observed values however there was an overall underestimation across the range of values for each element goodness of fit statistics particularly adjr2 values of boron presented in fig 3 show moderate accuracies relative to other water quality parameters however the observed vs estimated boron values plotted in fig 4 show the limited number of unique values in the observation dataset with only five unique values above 0 05 mg l such limited values do not agree well with the estimated values resulting in the high rmse values 25 shown in fig 3 it is useful to compare the frequency of band usage in estimating the water quality parameters in order to highlight the contributions of bands fig 5 depicts the total number of times each band appeared in models to estimate all parameters the frequency represents the total count of each band included in the models identified as having the best in terms of aic ranking for example three bands of aster data provide three best models per water quality parameter one using a single band one using two bands and one using three bands as predictors a band of aster image therefore may appear in any number of these models for estimating each variable the red and nir bands had high frequencies in all sensors similarly the blue band also had high frequencies in landsat sentinel and spot images while this band was not available in aster for this study the coastal blue band was also used frequently however this band is currently available only in landsat and sentinel data of the four images considered in the study 3 2 comparability of lowest aic model with a parsimonious model models reported in the above sections represent lowest aic values and in most cases included two or more spectral bands as predictors we compared these models against a parsimonious model that used fewer predictor bands we adopted two rules in selecting a model as a candidate for comparison with the lowest aic model firstly following our observations of all the models we specified the candidate model to be within 15 aic units of the lowest aic model secondly we selected the model that has the lowest number of predictors among candidate models within the 15 aic unit fig 6 a shows the correlation between the lowest aic model and the model that met the two rules defined above per water quality parameter it should be noted that the comparison was not applied to a model that had the lowest aic value and contained only one predicting band for example eight water quality parameters were estimated by models with lowest aic values using a single band of aster imagery as the predictor and therefore no alternative parsimonious models were sought for these parameters the pearson correlation coefficient between the best model and comparable parsimonious model varied between 0 41 for phs and 0 97 for magnesium when aster was used for landsat the correlation between the best model and comparable parsimonious models varied between r 0 6 for ph and 0 98 for sar weak correlations were also observed for comparable models particularly for estimating ph and iron using spot images in general favourable comparisons were obtained for sentinel based models except for the estimation of magnesium r 0 25 a notable observation from the correlations is the similarity in competing models among sensors for estimating certain parameters for example all sensors provided highly comparable models r 0 8 for estimating sar fig 6a a similar observation can also be made for ec permanent hardness and k in contrast considerable correlation differences among sensors are noted for a number of parameters such as ph fe and f in which sentinel yielded the most correlated competing models similarly all sensors except sentinel produced well correlated competing models r 0 7 to estimate mg it should be noted that good correlations between candidate models do not necessarily imply good estimation accuracies for example the competing models developed from landsat were accurate relative to observed sar too fig 6b on the other hand the competing models for estimating k using spot data had a high correlation against each other r 0 77 but both were poor against observed values fig 6c such high comparability among estimates of competing models but low accuracy against the truth observed data were observed for estimating f using sentinel fig 6d and so4 2 using aster fig 6e 3 3 cross sensor comparison using matching bands sensors were compared using estimates quantified by models containing similar bands such as blue band based models of all sensors the comparison therefore was limited to images containing common bands that were used frequently to estimate most of the water quality parameters accordingly we decided to use landsat sentinel and spot images containing the visible and infrared bands that were part of most models in the three images fig 5 in contrast the aster image lacked the blue band and therefore was excluded from the comparison results of the comparisons using landsat sentinel and spot images and pearson s correlation r are presented in fig 7 three distinct observations can be made from the comparisons firstly models generated using the blue band as a single predictor in each imagery have the greatest similarity across sensors to estimate all the water quality parameters except ca for example all pairwise correlations between the three sensors for estimating cl b sar na tds k fe and no3 exceeded 0 95 secondly pairwise sensor similarities generally decreased as the number of predictor variables used in a model increased thirdly the greatest similarity was observed mostly between landsat and sentinel sensors across the number of predictors used in the models the differences in the correlations of landsat sentinel and the other pairs tended to increase as the number of predictors increased that is the landsat sentinel correlation was comparable to the landsat spot and sentinel spot correlations when using a one variable model blue band based model while the differences in the correlations between sensors were greater for models that made use of two or more bands this can be observed for a number of estimations such as cl phs and so4 among others 4 discussion 4 1 overall accuracies of aster landsat 8 oli sentinel 2 msi and spot 6 this study sought to assess the performances of four satellite image data including landsat 8 oli aster sentinel 2 msi and spot 6 in quantifying water quality parameters within a mining area specifically we targeted three objectives 1 evaluating the performances of best estimation models derived from the four images irrespective of the predicting bands used in the models 2 comparing models containing fewer predictors with those obtained in objective 1 and 3 comparing models developed using similar bands across sensors to determine the level of reproducibility of accuracy across sensors the all subsets regression method was used to achieve our objectives by relating 17 water quality parameters and reflectance values of visible and infrared bands available in the satellite images this regression approach was preferred because it yields all possible models and thus serves as an exploratory as well as a predictive tool the resultant model comparisons within and across sensors are therefore exhaustive and looks at all alternative models compared to other approaches that generate a single best model based on a certain statistical significance applying such a modelling approach is justifiable for water quality modelling which is known to vary greatly with factors such as type of remote sensing data and sampling design liu et al 2003 in general the ability to estimate water quality parameters using each sensor was encouraging for a number of water quality parameters such as sar permanent hardness and cations with a relative rmse of 50 while it was less accurate for anions fig 3 these findings are comparable to tesfamichael and ndlovu 2018 who focussed on some water quality parameters like in the current study using landsat and aster it should be noted that the samples used by tesfamichael and ndlovu were fewer n 31 compared to 78 in the current study and spread over a larger spatial area than the current study resulting in a great deal of variation in values in light of this our results based on relatively low data variations were impressive and indicate the value of remote sensing at such a local scale this bodes well for the assessment of water quality risks within mining environments where multiple interdependent factors induce localized variations gilsbach et al 2019 karaoui et al 2019 used sentinel 2 msi data to estimate nitrate and phosphate at r2 of 0 67 and 0 54 respectively these accuracies were better than our results r2 0 50 for both variables fig 3 however karaoui et al took samples well inside the water reservoir focus of their study to avoid inclusion of spectral reflectance from the reservoir bottom thereby minimizing sources of uncertainty in contrast the samples used in our study were drawn from relatively shallow water bodies and therefore the images from these sampling locations could contain reflectance from the bottom of the water bodies as well mushtaq and lala 2017 reported r2 of 0 36 0 73 for different water quality parameters including ph hardness cl ec and phosphate using landsat oli applied to 11 samples it is nonetheless important to recognize the rather low graphical correlations between spectra and many of the water quality parameters nonetheless these studies concur with ours in showing the suitability of sentinel 2 msi sensor in water quality assessments relative comparison among the sensors shows the superiority of sentinel followed by landsat data according to the performances of models that returned the lowest aic figs 3 and 4 previous studies such as manzo et al 2015 and yadav et al 2019 have also shown the superiority of sentinel msi to landsat data in different water quality modelling efforts the relative comparability between sentinel msi and landsat in our study is attributed to the largely similar number and characteristics of bands they possess fig 2b and c the spectral similarities between the two images were also shown by chastain et al 2019 using analysis of data for the conterminous united states of america in addition it is important to note the closeness of acquisition dates of landsat and sentinel data both of which fell within the same month table 2 the superiority of landsat and sentinel msi to aster and spot 6 sensors fig 3 is justified given the number of spectral bands they possess and the modelling approach used in the study that is the all subsets regression approach does not restrict the number of bands that can be incorporated in the best model with the lowest aic value the approach therefore should logically work well for images that have a large number of bands to choose from burnham and anderson 2002 even so aster based models had promising accuracies despite the limited total number of bands n 3 used to generate candidate models indicating the relative suitability of few spectral bands available in all the four images this specific argument was corroborated by the fact that the most frequently used bands to build models for estimating the water quality parameters were somehow similar across sensors fig 5 the relatively weaker estimation accuracies obtained using spot 6 than sentinel and landsat data in the present study can be indicative of the advantage of spectral detail over spatial resolution it should however be noted that this observation may apply to the same spatial scale sampling interval and water quality characteristics as those used in the current study 4 2 focus on parsimonious models one of the benefits of the all subsets regression approach is the opportunity it offers for direct comparison of multiple models differing in predictor size but all developed from a given sample set this by extension is useful to evaluate the goodness of a simplified model compared to a complex model that contains many predictors burnham and anderson 2002 for each water quality parameter a parsimonious model was selected if it used a small number of predictors and was within a distance of 15 aic units from the model that had the lowest aic statistic most of the water quality parameters could be estimated by one or two bands of a sensor and would produce results comparable to the model that had the lowest aic fig 6 it is important to note that such comparability applies irrespective of accuracy against the observed values that is two or more comparable models can have equally good or unsatisfactory estimation accuracies this shows that rather few bands are sufficient to capture the variations in water quality parameters using the sensors considered in the study however the relative comparison among sensors in general shows greater similarities between the parsimonious and the lowest aic models for most water quality parameters for sentinel 2 msi than for other sensors fig 6 this is specifically significant considering the originally high number of predictors that yielded the lowest aic values for sentinel based models fig 3 having alternative models afforded by all subsets regression is logically advantageous particularly when there is uncertainty in the quality of information carried by certain bands for example atmospheric interferences are common over inland water bodies due to constituents such as phytoplankton and particulate matters associated with continental bodies siegel et al 2000 palmer et al 2015 such interferences affect bands differently doxani et al 2018 de keukelaere et al 2018 and thus the signal to noise ratio of affected bands can be too low for valid retrieval of water quality 4 3 sensor comparison using similar bands the all subsets regression approach allows us to make a direct comparison between models created from similar bands this opportunity should therefore be exploited to provide an indication of the reproducibility of results using different sensors with similar bands pairwise sensor comparisons landsat vs sentinel landsat vs spot sentinel vs spot showed that similarity among sensors was greatest when a single band blue was used while the similarity generally decreased as the number of predictors increased fig 7 this is attributed to the fact that the use of a single band e g blue for all sensors limits the discrepancy in estimation accuracy error even if the bandwidth or band edges may differ for the four sensors fig 2 in contrast the decreasing similarity across sensors as the number of predictors per model increases can logically be attributed to the combined effects of differences in bandwidth and band edges among sensors another key observation in the pairwise comparison between sensors revealed the greatest similarity between landsat 8 and sentinel 2 data this was not surprising since the two images share a certain level of similarities in terms of band compositions and reflectance properties mandanici and bitelli 2016 chastain et al 2019 the similarity in the performance of the landsat and sentinel multispectral sensors is encouraging in light of the continuous efforts to harmonize products of the two sensors as part of achieving seamless data claverie et al 2018 4 4 a note on the timeliness of remotely sensed data our study used field survey and remotely sensed data acquired within the same season in the study areas table 2 and thus we assumed the time window to be acceptable for direct comparison between the two data sets this assumption can also hold considering the river of interest pass through wetland systems that have a stabilizing effect on the extent and qualities of the water that is the water qualities are believed to remain unchanged for a certain period of time in comparison with continuously flowing water as encountered in strictly traditional river systems however any study focussed on characterizing a river system such as ours should ideally narrow the data acquisition time window this study unfortunately relied on remotely sensed data with temporal resolutions that did not necessarily coincide within the ideal time window of the field survey it is therefore important to be cautious in the interpretation of the findings although we used an all subsets regression approach that inherently allows for an exhaustive comparison of all possible estimation models burnham and anderson 2002 we therefore encourage more temporally pointed data acquisitions when assessing water quality of river systems timeliness becomes even vital when a routine monitoring for efficient sustainable management of rivers is the intended goal of applying remote sensing techniques in this regard high temporal resolution remotely sensed data sources such as customized aerial and drone surveys can be considered as practical alternatives furthermore calibration of spectral information between sensors acquired at staggered times such as between sentinel and landsat does improve temporal resolutions claverie et al 2018 and thus is expected to provide a cost free water quality monitoring support 5 conclusions the present study assessed the performances of aster landsat 8 sentinel 2 and spot 6 images to estimate water quality parameters in a mining area in general estimations were promising for certain water quality parameters such as sar permanent hardness and cations using all sensors a comparative observation of the four data sources showed sentinel 2 to be marginally the best followed closely by landsat data for estimating most of the water quality parameters due to the large number of bands these images could contribute to model development figs 3 and 4 comparability of model performances derived from sentinel and landsat is also attributed to the spectral similarity between the two images the similarities between the two sensors remained the strongest when models were generated using similar bands in both models e g blue band based models of the two images fig 7 these findings coupled with design efforts to harmonize sentinel and landsat point towards the complementary usage of these images for water quality monitoring the application of the all subsets regression in this study allowed for direct comparisons of several models one advantage in this regard was to evaluate models that use different predictors the study showed the comparability of original model that contained 2 predicting bands with those that have less predictors for each image fig 6 identifying the optimal parsimonious model and the predictors therein is helpful in focussing on bands with limited atmospheric effect finally our study used data acquired in the winter season when water bodies were clearly identifiable by earth observation sensors it is important to extend such a study to the other seasons and ultimately to a year round

5066,in the mid high latitude region variations of stable isotopic compositions of atmospheric precipitation δ18op and δdp were commonly regarded as reflecting the temperature effect however some studies have indicated that changes in moisture sources are important controlling factors for δ18op to clarify whether there are connections between δ18op and variations of moisture sources in southwest france sw france whose implications for speleothem δ18o are of great importance we have used among the longest isotopic time series from sw france le mas and villars stations and a 5 days reconstruction of air mass history during the 1997 2016 a d period based on the hysplit tracking model we found the percentage of initial moisture sources pims as important factors controlling the oxygen isotope composition of precipitation in sw france whether monthly or inter annual timescale was considered additionally we observed that the δ18op preserved the signal of local temperature supporting the temperature effect while no evidence for its amount effect has been observed these quantified links between pims local temperature and δ18op appear useful references to understand the link between stable oxygen isotopes and climate parameters our long term monitoring of δ18op d excess and moisture sources reveals decadal trends highlighting a tight coupling in hydrologic systems and relatively fast changes on rainfall sources controlled by atmospheric circulations in sw france keywords rainfall isotope ratios hysplit model moisture sources temperature southwest france 1 introduction the stable isotopic compositions of atmospheric precipitation δ18op and δdp see acronyms in appendix table 1 are important tools for understanding regional atmospheric circulations and the local hydrological cycle dansgaard 1964 sharp 2007 gat 2010 genty et al 2014 the mechanism between temperature precipitation and isotope ratios in rainfall are considerably complex including these processes like rayleigh fractionation diffusive exchange of isotopes between raindrops and vapor as well as re evaporation of falling rainfall fricke and o neil 1999 araguás araguás et al 2000 araguás araguás and diaz teijeiro 2005 risi et al 2008 lachniet 2009 the δ18o in many natural archives has been used to reconstruct the paleoenvironment over the past few years petit et al 1999 wang 2001 hu et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 mcdermott et al 2011 thus the investigation and qualification on the various factors governing rainfall stable isotopes are of great importance for the paleoclimate community krklec and domínguez villar 2014 krklec et al 2018 average monthly local temperatures generally measured 2 m above ground level are statistically correlated with the monthly δ18op and δdp on middle and high latitude monitoring stations called the temperature effect dansgaard 1964 iaea working group 2000 particularly obvious on the european continent krklec and domínguez villar 2014 krklec et al 2018 however the relationship on the inter annual timescale remains unclear additionally some researchers have revealed that the inter annual atmospheric variability such as north atlantic oscillation nao also controls rainfall isotopic values baldini et al 2008 fischer and mattey 2012 however local precipitation and monthly isotope ratios do not exhibit significant correlations in continental europe dansgaard 1964 some previous studies have proposed that moisture sources were important controlling factors for δ18op and δdp cruz san julian et al 1992 cole et al 1999 friedman et al 2002 lachniet 2009 moisture source locations are generally estimated by the calculation of the deuterium excess d excess revealing significatively different between the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea dansgaard 1964 craig and gordon 1965 vimeux et al 1999 uemura et al 2012 moreover d excess also reflects the variations on near surface relative humidity rh during evaporation and the temperature of moisture sources pfahl and sodemann 2014 however by using this method it is extremely difficult to quantify the pathway of water vapor transportation limiting the understanding of the change of moisture sources for δ18op and δdp particularly for spatial and temporal evapotranspiration et contributions to overcome this issue the history of air mass has been calculated by studying regional general circulation using lagrangian models however obvious discrepancies between observed isotopes and variations of modeled air mass were questioned which may be due to the insufficient accuracy of models hoffmann et al 1998 sturm et al 2005 schmidt et al 2007 sodemann et al 2008 pfahl and wernli 2008 langebroek et al 2011 therefore this raised question of how to accurately quantify the variability of initial moisture sources which is important for explaining the climatic significance of δ18op and δdp aggarwal et al 2004 the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model draxler and hess 1998 an advanced system calculating air parcel trajectories has been greatly promoted stein et al 2015 this atmospheric calculation model based on the eulerian and hybrid lagrangian approaches can accurately reflect the variation of moisture sources stein et al 2015 among them the lagrangian method is using a moving framework as references for the calculation of diffusion and advection when the trajectories or air parcels move from the initial source region and the eulerian methodology is using a restricted three dimensional grid cell to compute air concentrations stein et al 2015 additionally hysplit software has been successfully applied in several studies including tracking the atmospheric circulation change breitenbach et al 2010 abouelmagd et al 2012 dumitru et al 2017 sánchez murillo et al 2020 predicting the direction of pollutant diffusion chen et al 2012 and monitoring wildfire smoke rolph et al 2009 in southwest france sw france there are very few published data concerning stable isotopes of precipitation especially for long time series i e 10 years our research sites including le mas and villars stations are situated on karst areas and rainfall isotope ratios e g δ18op δdp are regarded as a good tool to determine the source of the seepage water ladouche et al 2009 and its variations in time and consequences on cave isotopic calcite compositions speleothems genty et al 2001 2006 2014 genty 2008 more importantly this area is a key place for studying the moisture pathway from the north atlantic and the mediterranean across the european continent duffourg and ducrocq 2011 and our long term observations for rainfall δ18o as well as its environment parameters allow us to confidential understand the local hydrological cycle and climate change in summary there are the following unresolved scientific limitations about stable isotopic compositions of rainfall in sw france including 1 unclear relationships and mechanisms between initial moisture sources and δ18op on the monthly and inter annual timescales 2 unquantified links between δ18op and various controlling factors temperature rainfall and moisture source here we combined with δ18op in sw france the data of moisture sources and regional local climatic parameters addressing these above mentioned scientific questions our study attempts to determine the variation of initial moisture sources and its relation to stable isotopic compositions of rainfall in the sw france using the hysplit model the links between δ18op and various controlling factors were also quantified to eventually calibrate the relationships between local climate parameters and δ18op in other regions of france as well as deepen understanding for the significance of cave speleothem δ18o 2 study area rainfall samples were collected from two monitoring sites namely le mas 45 7 45 n 1 11 31 e and villars 45 26 18 n 0 47 2 e fig 1 a and b about 20 km far each other during the monitoring period from 1997 to 2016 the mean annual amount of precipitation at the villars station is 1003 mm standard deviation 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is 12

2014 genty 2008 the large scale atmospheric circulation in western europe we is affected by climatic system influences from different geographic areas such as atlantic mediterranean greenland and european continents giuntoli et al 2013 the most important circulation pattern is considered to be the winter north atlantic oscillation nao which is a driver for streamflow in north and west europe other large scale circulation patterns such as the arctic oscillation ao or atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo have also influenced the climatic variation in west europe region o reilly et al 2016 in order to better quantify spatial distributions of initial moisture sources the research region was divided into six sections fig 1a appendix table 1 namely proximal atlantic and west europe pawe

composition as well as the concentrated locations of moisture sources fig 1a lachniet 2009 krklec and domínguez villar 2014 3 methods and data 3 1 stable isotopic compositions of rainwater the stable isotopic samples were collected in the le mas and villars stations at an approximately monthly scale during the period from 1997 to 2016 rainfall sampling protocol follows the recommended principles from the global network of isotope in precipitation gnip from the international atomic energy agency iaea the rainwater is collected in a 5 l tank with a funnel before the tank is buried in the soil each sample have added a few ml of liquid paraffin to prevent any evaporation water is collected into a 15 ml glass bottle which is closed by a specific cork with a conical funnel making sure waterproofness the hydrogen isotopic composition δd of the precipitation samples were measured on an iso prime mass spectrometer and a picarro laser spectrometer and the analytical absolute error for δd is 0 5 the oxygen isotopes δ18o were measured on a finnigan mat 252 by equilibration with co2 with an analytical error of 0 05 in order to avoid potential paraffin pollution all measured samples were filtered through 0 2 μm anlypore filters on the picarro spectrometer the memory effect was treated by doing 6 7 times successive measurements of the same sample and by keeping only the last 3 results to determine the value of rainfall δd for the calibration we used an internal epb standard laboratoire de sciences du climat et de l environnement lsce as working reference standards that was cross checked the final results of δ18o and δd are then expressed relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow early measurements in 1997 and 1998 were measured on a vg sira irms with an error of 0 2 for the δ18o while δd was performed using the zinc reduction method with an error close to 2 genty et al 2014 3 2 meteorological data european precipitation data were downloaded from the

hysplit model was downloaded from the noaa air resources laboratory website http ready arl noaa gov hysplit php draxler and rolph 2010 in order to analyze the temporal variability of moisture sources we have divided a year into four seasons spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february of the following year previous studies have revealed that trajectories with the average residence time of water vapor in the atmosphere are 120 h 5 days numaguti 1999 krklec and domínguez villar 2014 therefore variations of moisture sources were identified in the villars station we assumed a common source for le mas station being very close to villars during the previous 120 h 5 days krklec and domínguez villar 2014 krklec et al 2018 the water vapor transportation usually occurs mainly at 1500 m 3000 m above ground level a g l in the mid low troposphere however the peak value of water vapor transportation in the plain is at the altitude of 1500 m 850 hpa tang et al 2015 cai et al 2017 moreover the back trajectories from different elevations showed similar paths and regulations krklec and domínguez villar 2014 krklec et al 2018 therefore we consider the only altitude of 1500 m a g l as the initial vertical height for the water vapor transportation the integrated system was operated for computing the daily trajectory at the time of 00 00 06 00 12 00 and 18 00 and the output of trajectories are made every 6 h the cluster analysis tool was applied for integrating all trajectories which were grouped according to the horizontal moving speed and direction in hysplit model tang et al 2015 finally hysplit4 software is used for superposition analysis and designed to get the diagram to determine the variation of the initial moisture source 3 4 statistical methods and packages the correlations between regional parameters and δ18op variability in sw france were calculated using r programming significance levels for correlations

freedom of student t statistics n is the length of the time series and ax ay are the first order autocorrelation of each time series the links between pims temperature and δ18op were established using

regional climate parameters the correlation of the δ18op between villars and le mas stations is 0 72 p 0 01 fig 2 a b suggesting that both were controlled by the same air mass and climate local meteoric water line lmwl in the two monitoring sites are defined by δdp 6 91 δ18op 3 02 p 0 01 for le mas and δdp 7 08 δ18op 5 03 p 0 01 for villars based on the linear regression fig 2c in order to verify the reliability of lmwl equations we also used other different methods including ordinary least squares regression olsr and precipitation weighted least squares regression pwlsr hughes and crawford 2012 crawford et al 2014 whether weighted or non weighted regressions were considered close slopes and gradients were observed from three methods table 1 rainfall stable isotopes are characterized by strong seasonal variations with depleted average values in winter months december january february 43 2 to 47 7 for δdp and 6 9 to 7 5 for δ18op and enriched average values during summer months june july august 27 8 to 31 5 for δdp and 4 6 to 5 1 for δ18op appendix table 2 in villars and le mas stations on the monthly timescale δ18op and local temperature show positive correlations at villars r 0 61 p 0 0001 and le mas r 0 62 p 0 0001 for the considered period 1996 2016 fig 3 a with the t δ18op gradient of 0 17 c and 0 15 c respectively this indicates that the δ18op in sw france is mainly affected by local temperature compared with observed alley and cuffey 2001 and modeled schmidt et al 2007 t δ18op gradients over the global scale ranging from 0 17 c to 0 9 c t δ18op gradients in the le mas and villars stations are close to the lowest value on the contrary δ18op and local precipitation do not exhibit significant correlations r 0 19 at le mas and r 0 29 at villars with the gradient of 0 7 100 mm and 0 8 100 mm respectively fig 3b in order to assess local δ18op records in sw france whether or not can be sensitive to the variation of regional parameters correlations between δ18op from le mas and villars stations and european temperature with 5 5 global grids were calculated on the seasonal timescale for the 1996 2016 period results show that significant correlations are mostly found for winter djf and spring mam fig 4 a b e f at le mas station the time series of δ18op displays positive correlations with northern europe temperature and negative ones with the temperature of south europe and the mediterranean area fig 4a a similar pattern also occurs for the villars station although these correlations are weaker fig 4e possibly due to a lack of some monthly data in villars fig 4e appendix table 2 moreover during spring mam correlations of δ18op and regional temperature show positive northwest europe and negative north africa and mediterranean area relationships at both stations fig 4b and f unlike high correlations between local temperature and δ18op on all months fig 3a regional relationships were only reflected in winter and spring figs 3a and 4 the relationship between regional precipitation and δ18op for all the seasons was also considered fig 5 despite the globally much weaker correlations we observed that in winter regional precipitation with 2 5 2 5 global grids and δ18op show similar spatial patterns between regional temperature and δ18op figs 4a e 5a e during spring mam δ18op and regional precipitation show positive patterns with north europe and north african and the mediterranean sea and negative ones all over the european continent fig 5b and f during summer jja and autumn son seasons no or less significant correlations were observed between temperature precipitation and δ18op for both stations figs 4c d g h 5c d g h the degrees of freedom corrections were calculated between the two 20 year time series of δ18op from sw france le mas and villars and the atlantic sst with 5 5 global grids fig 6 the result shows that δ18op values are positively correlated with sst in the gulf stream of mexico fig 6b f and opposite to sst in northern and southern of north atlantic inducing tripolar sst distributions in the north atlantic in spring however during other seasons no or less significant correlations were observed between sst and δ18op for both stations fig 6a c d e g h note that whether we consider patterns of δ18op and european temperature or precipitation in le mas and villars stations in winter and spring it is similar to spatial patterns between nao phase and european temperature precipitation cassou et al 2004 baldini et al 2008 figs 4a e 5a e the link between nao index and δ18op seems to be confirmed by their high correlations p 0 01 or p 0 05 in winter r 0 45 and r 0 42 and spring r 0 33 and r 0 36 fig 7 a d 4 2 relationships between δ18op and initial moisture sources on the monthly timescale in order to localize moisture sources of the rainfall the percentage of initial moisture pims in villars station we first used the hysplit software for periods of high summer and low winter δ18op fig 8 results show a clear seasonal variability in the back trajectories with much longer pathways in december january and february compared to the summer months june july and august fig 8 during winter some vapor sources reach areas clearly beyond the 60 w meridian while in summer the extreme west sources are significantly closer to villars around the extreme east of canada fig 8d 8e 8f but when replaced in the spatial pattern of fig 1 and looking at actual percentages given by the software calculation table 2 it appears that water vapor sources in winter are mostly distributed in the region of nagr west north atlantic north america and greenland characterized by the longer transportation table 2 fig 8a c while in summer it is mostly from the closest source pawe proximal atlantic and west europe table 2 fig 8d f these results show that mositure sources characterized by the pims and rainfall δ18op in sw france are characterized by a well marked seasonality negative δ18op excursions occur in winter when there is a longer initial moisture location e g nagr table 2 fig 8a c on the contrary the δ18op in summer shows positive δ18op excursions which coincides with the closer initial moisture location e g pawe table 2 fig 8d f during spring and autumn there is no obvious contrasted pims fig 9 we however note that pims in the near summer months e g may and september is derived from the increased closer moisture source pawe and the decreased longer moisture source nagr corresponding to heavier values of δ18op and δdp table 2 and appendix table 2 fig 9c d in contrast in the near winter months e g march and november pims from the closer source e g pawe is decreased and the longer source is increased e g nagr table 2 fig 9a f indicating that the change of pims can regulate the δ18op on the monthly timescale in sw france these results highlight close relationships between pims and δ18op values at villars and le mas a high pims from closer regions e g pawe and na is related to heavier δ18op values while the high pims from farther regions e g nagr is related to lower δ18op values table 2 appendix table 2 linear equations have been established for le mas and villars stations to quantify relationships between δ18op and pims table 3 results show positive relationships p 0 01 or p 0 05 between δ18op and pims in the region of pawe and na and negative relationships p 0 01 between δ18op and pims in the region of nagr whereas the rest of regions me and da have much less impact on δ18op values table 3 4 3 relationships between δ18op d excess and initial moisture sources local climate parameters on the annual and inter annual timescale on the annual timescale positive relationships p 0 05 in both le mas and villars stations were observed between the annual average δ18op δ18oap and annual mean temperature with a t δ18oap gradients of 0 42 c and 0 51 c respectively these values fallen in the range of observed gradients from global continental marine and polar sites 0 17 c to 0 9 c clark and fritz 1999 fig 10 a b at the opposite p δ18oap gradients are low 0 1 100 mm and 0 07 100 mm for le mas and villars and no significant correlations p 0 1 were observed fig 10c d the locations of pims were determined using 5 days reconstruction of air mass history during 1997 2016 table 4 fig 11 curiously nagr and pawe are the principal moisture sources i e roughly 60 while na and da are substantial contributors i e roughly 34 and the rest of regions me and nesa have little impact at least for the 1997 2016 period table 4 fig 11 on the annual timescale annual average values for δ18o and δd δ18oap and δdap were calculated for the same period fig 12 a appendix table 3 annual δ18oap value at le mas and villars stations varies from 5 38 to 7 24 and 5 16 to 7 09 respectively appendix table 3 the annual weighted δ18op means δ18ow range from 4 63 to 7 00 and 4 69 to 6 79 for le mas and villars respectively appendix table 3 whereas the δ18op has a significant variation at the monthly timescale it is much lower on the inter annual timescale appendix tables 2 and 3 we also determine correlations between pims and mean annual precipitation isotope compositions δ18oap and δ18ow for the 1997 2016 period fig 12 table 4 and appendix table 2 results show clear trends from the time series of stable isotopes in le mas and villars fig 12a b δ18ow and δ18oap display decreasing trends for both stations le mas and villars on the 1997 2016 studied period which coincides with i the decreasing trends of initial moisture sources pims of closer regions e g pawe and na fig 12c d and ii the increasing trends of pims of longer pathways e g da and nagr fig 12e f however weak or less inter annual variations for local temperature and precipitation were observed over the past 20 year fig 12g h in consequence it appears that most of the inter annual variability of the rainfall isotopic composition δ18op is controlled by variations of the proportion of different sources characterized by pims trends the term of d excess was firstly defined by dansgaard 1964 as the following equation d excess δd 8 δ18o illustrating the degree of deviation from the equilibrium of isotopic fractionation caused by the kinetic fractionation in the evaporation of vapors dansgaard 1964 rainfall d excess exhibited weak inter annual increasing trends in villars and le mas over the past 20 years and the value range from 17 6 to 9 0 with the average value being 10 6 for le mas and 17 6 to 1 7 with the average value being 9 5 for villars respectively fig 13 a b which is close to the value of 10 for the average of global precipitation annual variation of d excess coincides with increasing trends of pims of longer pathways e g da and nagr and a weak increasing trend in local temperature fig 13a e 5 discussions 5 1 causes of the variations of precipitation isotope δ18op δdp in sw france whether considering the monthly or inter annual timescale it appears that δ18op of both le mas and villars stations follow variations of pims and local temperature several factors may be raised to explain the δ18op variability i the length of the water vapor transportation route which plays an important role on the rayleigh fractionation process ii the initial mean seawater δ18o δ18osw values may be different iii the removal of moisture from an air mass is temperature dependent during rayleigh fractionation and the progressive condensation of the vapor requires the cooling of the air mass from the vapor of cloud to the falling rain iaea working group 2000 5 1 1 amount effect and temperature effect compared with global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 we observed that there are lower slopes and lower intercepts in the lmwl of the two monitoring sites le mas and villars fig 2c genty et al 2014 this is a general case for continental stations iaea working group 2000 and may be attributed to evaporation during the process of precipitation under the clouds and various complex phenomena linked to the history of rainfall dansgaard 1964 stewart 1975 gat 1996 peng et al 2005 yamanaka et al 2007 lachniet 2009 pang et al 2011 chen et al 2015 fig 2c positive correlations were observed between δ18op and local monthly annual mean temperature figs 3a 10a b in le mas and villars the main reason is that the air mass after leaving from the moisture source is dominated by rayleigh fractionation processes temperature and rain out dependent dansgaard 1954 1964 bowen 2008 water vapor in the atmosphere is difficult to isothermally condense and any progress of atmospheric precipitation is caused by a temperature cooling dansgaard 1954 1964 when the condensed water is formed then leaving water vapor immediately the stable isotope ratio is depleted in the condensed water with the decreasing of temperature dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 lachniet 2009 no significant correlations were observed between mean annual precipitation and δ18op suggesting no amount effect at the le mas and villars stations figs 3b 10c 10d genty et al 2014 additionally krklec and domínguez villar 2014 who conducted a monitoring work of δ18op in central spain proposing that all climate parameters with a seasonal cycle s characterization would exhibit a certain link with δ18op however when monitoring the relationship between single precipitation event and δ18op these links are not visible krklec and domínguez villar 2014 further indicating that the amount of precipitation is not affecting the δ18op 5 1 2 moisture source effect the transportation distances between moisture sources and the monitoring site latitude effect have already shown an important control on the δ18op aggarwal et al 2004 breitenbach et al 2010 chen and li 2018 based on the rayleigh fractionation process governing these links the increasing moisture transportation distances may result in depleted δ18op value field 2010 krklec and domínguez villar 2014 krklec et al 2018 in winter months the principal initial moisture sources derive from a longer source nagr in comparison with the summer season characterized by a closer moisture source pawe fig 8 the precipitation that occur during the migration of moisture are enriched in 18o leading to an impoverishment of remaining vapor and then resulting in a lower δ18op araguás araguás et al 2000 breitenbach et al 2010 cai et al 2016 therefore the longer the depression pathway the lower δ18op value araguás araguás et al 2000 lee fung 2008 risi et al 2008 lachniet et al 2009 kurita 2013 cai et al 2017 the mechanism is similar with the continental effect where the rain out above the continent is the cause of impoverishment of the δ18o with increasing distances from the ocean but very variable i e from region to region and from season to season iaea working group 2000 besides the discrepancy of initial mean sea water δ18osw value is also an important factor controlling the variation of δ18op values in sw france rozanski et al 1993 clark and fritz 1997 cole et al 1999 friedman et al 2002 most of moisture sources in villars and le mas come from two main areas nagr in winter and pawe in summer because the mean δ18osw in the nagr area 4 0 to 0 legrande and schmidt 2006 is lower than the one in the pawe area from 0 to 1 5 legrande and schmidt 2006 it may also be a significant contribution to the observed δ18op variations an important phenomenon appears at the inter annual timescale where changes of the δ18ow and δ18oap follow the inter annual initial locations of moisture sources fig 12 caused by rayleigh fractionation process and initial moisture sources figs 11 and 12 previous works have revealed that the δ18od drip water δ18o inherited the signal of atmospheric precipitation on the monthly timescale and the influence of the mixing effect with old water in the epikarst zone pape et al 2010 li et al 2011 partin et al 2013 zhang and li 2019 seriously damp or even suppress the rainfall seasonal characteristics e g heavier in summer and lighter in winter genty et al 2014 however other studies indicated that the δ18od and δ18oc can respond to the signal of δ18ow on the interannual timescale chen and li 2018 ellis et al 2020 our results show that the inter annual δ18op and δdp variations are controlled by the mean annual change of the initial location of moisture sources providing new insights to explain climatic significance of oxygen isotope of drip water and stalagmites on the interannual timescale in villars cave 5 2 variations of d excess on the annual timescale it is generally believed that d excess is sensitive to moisture source conditions pfahl and wernli 2008 pfahl and sodemann 2014 therefore which is suitable for assessing the origin of water vapor moreover some studies have proposed that high and increasing d excess values reflect the fast evaporation low rh and stronger kinetic isotope effects during evaporation clark and fritz 1997 dublyansky et al 2018 the linear variations of d excess and pims of longer pathways da and nagr exhibit increasing trends in le mas and villars fig 13a d reflecting enhanced evaporations and stronger kinetic isotope effects in the transportation of vapor while moisture sources from longer pathways were increased over the entire period clark and fritz 1997 pfahl and wernli 2008 dublyansky et al 2018 the increasing of air temperature at the monitoring stations over the past 20 years leads to the enhancement of water vapor evaporation inducing the rising of precipitation d excess fig 13a b e hence our results suggest that the d excess variations in paleo record e g ice cores should be adapted to reflect moisture sources characterized by atmospheric circulations and local temperature 5 3 links between nao and δ18op in sw france during a positive phase of the nao a large pressure gradient between the azores high pressure and iceland low pressure across the north atlantic creates higher winter temperatures and precipitation over the atlantic and northern europe while it is lower over the mediterranean sea and north africa hurrell 1995 1996 vo 2003 the exactly opposite pattern in the negative nao phase is found when the pressure gradient between azores and iceland decreases by shifting southwards on the northern hemisphere westerly jet stream hurrell 1995 nao in different phase plays an important role in the length of water vapor transportation in winter and spring baldini et al 2008 when winter and spring nao index is in the positive excursion warmer westerly winds will carry 18o moisture with a shorter transportation distance resulting in heavier δ18op values in sw france baldini et al 2008 langebroek et al 2011 therefore nao index and δ18op exhibit positive correlations fig 7a d however nao only takes a strengthened or weakened effect on the length of water vapor transportation in winter baldini et al 2008 which will not change the fact that most of winter moisture sources distributed in the region of longer distance west north atlantic north america and greenland section 4 2 krklec and domínguez villar 2014 the isotopic time series at the seasonal timescales show correlations with nao index providing a useful nao proxy δ18op to indicate the variation in the seasonal paleo nao index however when it comes to the relationship between nao and δ18op in the inter annual timescale a particularly weak correlation p 0 1 was found 5 4 quantifying the relationship between pims temperature and δ18op in sw france the variation of pims and local temperature have been identified as important contributors to the observed δ18op changes in sw france therefore combining the link between pims temperature and δ18op several equations were established using multiple linear regression analysis methods as followed for le mas station 1 δ18op 0 038 pawe 0 046 na 0 054 me 0 02 da 0 025 nagr 0 119 t 10 929 r 0 965 p 0 01 where δ18op indicates precipitation δ18o v smow and t c indicate the local monthly temperature in le mas for villars station 2 δ18op 0 035 pawe 0 031 na 0 054 me 0 001 da 0 005 nagr 0 049 t 8 637 r 0 942 p 0 05 where δ18op indicates precipitation δ18o v smow and t c indicate the local monthly temperature in villars these two equations allow us to evaluate the importance of the factors pims and temperature on the δ18op variability results show that the following factors influence the δ18op in the order on importances temperature nagr pawe na da me at the monthly timescale we use the spss software to calculate the variance of contribution rate and the proportion in the four main principal components are 60 6 temperature 16 6 nagr 15 4 pawe 6 2 na the rest of two component da and me is 2 therefore in any case considering the range of variability of various contributions from different moisture source regions and local temperature it is obviously found that local temperature is the principal variable controlling the oxygen isotope composition of precipitation in the continental european at the monthly timescale in addition adding the different variables step by step and look at the results we found that the multiple linear regression is more accurate to describe the relationship between isotopes and water vapor sources and air temperature compared to linear regression methods appendix table 4 the use of hysplit model for tracking moisture sources is providing a good example for how to accurately calculate the relationship between δ18op and moisture sources different from regional general circulation models of the δ18op cruz san julian et al 1992 celle jeanton et al 2001 sodemann et al 2008 this study not only provides the quantified mathematical equations based on the longest isotopic time series and variations of pims over 20 years but also determines the extent of the impact on the monthly timescale additionally speleothem δ18o in the villars cave also recorded a series of abrupt climatic events on the centennial millennial timescales such as dansgaard oeschger heinrich and 8 2 ka events genty et al 2001 2003 2006 genty 2008 wainer et al 2009 2011 2013 genty et al 2014 in this study the long monitoring based work established links between local climate parameters and δ18op which can be used for interpreting the significance of speleothem δ18o no or less correlations were observed between the δ18op and local precipitation indicating that speleothem δ18o in villars cave likely cannot reconstruct local precipitation in contrast changes in δ18op can be linked to the change of moisture sources and to local temperature 6 conclusions based on the observations and models on δ18op and δdp moisture sources and regional local climate parameters during the 1997 2016 period at the le mas and villars meteorological stations sw france the following conclusions can be drawn 1 based on hysplit model we have quantified the percentage of initial moisture sources pims for different months and found shorter transportation distances during summer months and longer ones during winter which is consistent with the observed seasonal variations of δ18op 2 the variations of temperature and pims are important factors that are the main causes on the seasonal variation of δ18op in the order of importances the following factors influence the δ18op temperature nagr pawe na da me and the proportions of four main principal components are 60 6 temperature 16 6 nagr 15 4 pawe 6 2 na on the monthly timescale 3 on the annual timescale δ18op maintains positive relationships with local mean annual temperature however no evidence for its amount effect has been observed 4 on a longer timescale an important result shows that an inter annual decreasing trend was observed for the δ18op δ18oap and δ18ow following the variation of annual pims we observed over the past 20 years that the percentage of the farther moisture source region nagr was increased at the opposite there is a decreasing trend for the closer source pawe 5 the linear trends over the past 20 years of d excess coincide with the variation of pims in longer pathways da and nagr and local temperature on the inter annual timescale which is likely attributed to the rise in global temperature and the change of moisture sources characterized by atmospheric circulation in sw france 6 the variation of moisture distribution regions should be considered when interpreting the

5066,in the mid high latitude region variations of stable isotopic compositions of atmospheric precipitation δ18op and δdp were commonly regarded as reflecting the temperature effect however some studies have indicated that changes in moisture sources are important controlling factors for δ18op to clarify whether there are connections between δ18op and variations of moisture sources in southwest france sw france whose implications for speleothem δ18o are of great importance we have used among the longest isotopic time series from sw france le mas and villars stations and a 5 days reconstruction of air mass history during the 1997 2016 a d period based on the hysplit tracking model we found the percentage of initial moisture sources pims as important factors controlling the oxygen isotope composition of precipitation in sw france whether monthly or inter annual timescale was considered additionally we observed that the δ18op preserved the signal of local temperature supporting the temperature effect while no evidence for its amount effect has been observed these quantified links between pims local temperature and δ18op appear useful references to understand the link between stable oxygen isotopes and climate parameters our long term monitoring of δ18op d excess and moisture sources reveals decadal trends highlighting a tight coupling in hydrologic systems and relatively fast changes on rainfall sources controlled by atmospheric circulations in sw france keywords rainfall isotope ratios hysplit model moisture sources temperature southwest france 1 introduction the stable isotopic compositions of atmospheric precipitation δ18op and δdp see acronyms in appendix table 1 are important tools for understanding regional atmospheric circulations and the local hydrological cycle dansgaard 1964 sharp 2007 gat 2010 genty et al 2014 the mechanism between temperature precipitation and isotope ratios in rainfall are considerably complex including these processes like rayleigh fractionation diffusive exchange of isotopes between raindrops and vapor as well as re evaporation of falling rainfall fricke and o neil 1999 araguás araguás et al 2000 araguás araguás and diaz teijeiro 2005 risi et al 2008 lachniet 2009 the δ18o in many natural archives has been used to reconstruct the paleoenvironment over the past few years petit et al 1999 wang 2001 hu et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 mcdermott et al 2011 thus the investigation and qualification on the various factors governing rainfall stable isotopes are of great importance for the paleoclimate community krklec and domínguez villar 2014 krklec et al 2018 average monthly local temperatures generally measured 2 m above ground level are statistically correlated with the monthly δ18op and δdp on middle and high latitude monitoring stations called the temperature effect dansgaard 1964 iaea working group 2000 particularly obvious on the european continent krklec and domínguez villar 2014 krklec et al 2018 however the relationship on the inter annual timescale remains unclear additionally some researchers have revealed that the inter annual atmospheric variability such as north atlantic oscillation nao also controls rainfall isotopic values baldini et al 2008 fischer and mattey 2012 however local precipitation and monthly isotope ratios do not exhibit significant correlations in continental europe dansgaard 1964 some previous studies have proposed that moisture sources were important controlling factors for δ18op and δdp cruz san julian et al 1992 cole et al 1999 friedman et al 2002 lachniet 2009 moisture source locations are generally estimated by the calculation of the deuterium excess d excess revealing significatively different between the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea dansgaard 1964 craig and gordon 1965 vimeux et al 1999 uemura et al 2012 moreover d excess also reflects the variations on near surface relative humidity rh during evaporation and the temperature of moisture sources pfahl and sodemann 2014 however by using this method it is extremely difficult to quantify the pathway of water vapor transportation limiting the understanding of the change of moisture sources for δ18op and δdp particularly for spatial and temporal evapotranspiration et contributions to overcome this issue the history of air mass has been calculated by studying regional general circulation using lagrangian models however obvious discrepancies between observed isotopes and variations of modeled air mass were questioned which may be due to the insufficient accuracy of models hoffmann et al 1998 sturm et al 2005 schmidt et al 2007 sodemann et al 2008 pfahl and wernli 2008 langebroek et al 2011 therefore this raised question of how to accurately quantify the variability of initial moisture sources which is important for explaining the climatic significance of δ18op and δdp aggarwal et al 2004 the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model draxler and hess 1998 an advanced system calculating air parcel trajectories has been greatly promoted stein et al 2015 this atmospheric calculation model based on the eulerian and hybrid lagrangian approaches can accurately reflect the variation of moisture sources stein et al 2015 among them the lagrangian method is using a moving framework as references for the calculation of diffusion and advection when the trajectories or air parcels move from the initial source region and the eulerian methodology is using a restricted three dimensional grid cell to compute air concentrations stein et al 2015 additionally hysplit software has been successfully applied in several studies including tracking the atmospheric circulation change breitenbach et al 2010 abouelmagd et al 2012 dumitru et al 2017 sánchez murillo et al 2020 predicting the direction of pollutant diffusion chen et al 2012 and monitoring wildfire smoke rolph et al 2009 in southwest france sw france there are very few published data concerning stable isotopes of precipitation especially for long time series i e 10 years our research sites including le mas and villars stations are situated on karst areas and rainfall isotope ratios e g δ18op δdp are regarded as a good tool to determine the source of the seepage water ladouche et al 2009 and its variations in time and consequences on cave isotopic calcite compositions speleothems genty et al 2001 2006 2014 genty 2008 more importantly this area is a key place for studying the moisture pathway from the north atlantic and the mediterranean across the european continent duffourg and ducrocq 2011 and our long term observations for rainfall δ18o as well as its environment parameters allow us to confidential understand the local hydrological cycle and climate change in summary there are the following unresolved scientific limitations about stable isotopic compositions of rainfall in sw france including 1 unclear relationships and mechanisms between initial moisture sources and δ18op on the monthly and inter annual timescales 2 unquantified links between δ18op and various controlling factors temperature rainfall and moisture source here we combined with δ18op in sw france the data of moisture sources and regional local climatic parameters addressing these above mentioned scientific questions our study attempts to determine the variation of initial moisture sources and its relation to stable isotopic compositions of rainfall in the sw france using the hysplit model the links between δ18op and various controlling factors were also quantified to eventually calibrate the relationships between local climate parameters and δ18op in other regions of france as well as deepen understanding for the significance of cave speleothem δ18o 2 study area rainfall samples were collected from two monitoring sites namely le mas 45 7 45 n 1 11 31 e and villars 45 26 18 n 0 47 2 e fig 1 a and b about 20 km far each other during the monitoring period from 1997 to 2016 the mean annual amount of precipitation at the villars station is 1003 mm standard deviation 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is 12

2014 genty 2008 the large scale atmospheric circulation in western europe we is affected by climatic system influences from different geographic areas such as atlantic mediterranean greenland and european continents giuntoli et al 2013 the most important circulation pattern is considered to be the winter north atlantic oscillation nao which is a driver for streamflow in north and west europe other large scale circulation patterns such as the arctic oscillation ao or atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo have also influenced the climatic variation in west europe region o reilly et al 2016

isotopic samples were collected in the le mas and villars stations at an approximately monthly scale during the period from 1997 to 2016 rainfall sampling protocol follows the recommended principles from the global network of isotope in precipitation gnip from the international atomic energy agency iaea the rainwater is collected in a 5 l tank with a funnel before the tank is buried in the soil each sample have added a few ml of liquid paraffin to prevent any evaporation water is collected into a 15 ml glass bottle which is closed by a specific cork with a conical funnel making sure waterproofness the hydrogen isotopic composition δd of the precipitation samples were measured on an iso prime mass spectrometer and a picarro laser spectrometer and the analytical absolute error for δd is 0 5 the oxygen isotopes δ18o were measured on a finnigan mat 252 by equilibration with co2 with an analytical error of 0 05 in order to avoid potential paraffin pollution all measured samples were filtered through 0 2 μm anlypore filters on the picarro spectrometer the memory effect was treated by doing 6 7 times successive measurements of the same sample and by keeping only the last 3 results to determine the value of rainfall δd for the calibration we used an internal epb standard laboratoire de sciences du climat et de l environnement lsce as working reference standards that was cross checked the final results of δ18o and δd are then expressed relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow early measurements in 1997 and 1998 were measured on a vg sira irms with an error of 0 2 for the δ18o while δd was performed using the zinc reduction method with an error close to 2 genty et al 2014 3 2 meteorological data european precipitation data were downloaded from the

hysplit model was downloaded from the noaa air resources laboratory website http ready arl noaa gov hysplit php draxler and rolph 2010 in order to analyze the temporal variability of moisture sources we have divided a year into four seasons spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february of the following year previous studies have revealed that trajectories with the average residence time of water vapor in the atmosphere are 120 h 5 days numaguti 1999 krklec and domínguez villar 2014 therefore variations of moisture sources were identified in the villars station we assumed a common source for le mas station being very close to villars during the previous 120 h 5 days krklec and domínguez villar 2014 krklec et al 2018 the water vapor transportation usually occurs mainly at 1500 m 3000 m above ground level a g l in the mid low troposphere however the peak value of water vapor transportation in the plain is at the altitude of 1500 m 850 hpa tang et al 2015 cai et al 2017 moreover the back trajectories from different elevations showed similar paths and regulations krklec and domínguez villar 2014 krklec et al 2018 therefore we consider the only altitude of 1500 m a g l as the initial vertical height for the water vapor transportation the integrated system was operated for computing the daily trajectory at the time of 00 00 06 00 12 00 and 18 00 and the output of trajectories are made every 6 h the cluster analysis tool was applied for integrating all trajectories which were grouped according to the horizontal moving speed and direction in hysplit model tang et al 2015 finally hysplit4 software is used for superposition analysis and designed to get the diagram to determine the variation of the initial moisture source 3 4 statistical methods and packages the correlations between regional parameters and δ18op variability in sw france were calculated using r programming significance levels for correlations

freedom of student t statistics n is the length of the time series and ax ay are the first order autocorrelation of each time series the links between pims temperature and δ18op were established using

regional climate parameters the correlation of the δ18op between villars and le mas stations is 0 72 p 0 01 fig 2 a b suggesting that both were controlled by the same air mass and climate local meteoric water line lmwl in the two monitoring sites are defined by δdp 6 91 δ18op 3 02 p 0 01 for le mas and δdp 7 08 δ18op 5 03 p 0 01 for villars based on the linear regression fig 2c in order to verify the reliability of lmwl equations we also used other different methods including ordinary least squares regression olsr and precipitation weighted least squares regression pwlsr hughes and crawford 2012 crawford et al 2014 whether weighted or non weighted regressions were considered close slopes and gradients were observed from three methods table 1 rainfall stable isotopes are characterized by strong seasonal variations with depleted average values in winter months december january february 43 2 to 47 7 for δdp and 6 9 to 7 5 for δ18op and enriched average values during summer months june july august 27 8 to 31 5 for δdp and 4 6 to 5 1 for δ18op appendix table 2 in villars and le mas stations on the monthly timescale δ18op and local temperature show positive correlations at villars r 0 61 p 0 0001 and le mas r 0 62 p 0 0001 for the considered period 1996 2016 fig 3 a with the t δ18op gradient of 0 17 c and 0 15 c respectively this indicates that the δ18op in sw france is mainly affected by local temperature compared with observed alley and cuffey 2001 and modeled schmidt et al 2007 t δ18op gradients over the global scale ranging from 0 17 c to 0 9 c t δ18op gradients in the le mas and villars stations are close to the lowest value on the contrary δ18op and local precipitation do not exhibit significant correlations r 0 19 at le mas and r 0 29 at villars with the gradient of 0 7 100 mm and 0 8 100 mm respectively fig 3b in order to assess local δ18op records in sw france whether or not can be sensitive to the variation of regional parameters correlations between δ18op from le mas and villars stations and european temperature with 5 5 global grids were calculated on the seasonal timescale for the 1996 2016 period results show that significant correlations are mostly found for winter djf and spring mam fig 4 a b e f at le mas station the time series of δ18op displays positive correlations with northern europe temperature and negative ones with the temperature of south europe and the mediterranean area fig 4a a similar pattern also occurs for the villars station although these correlations are weaker fig 4e possibly due to a lack of some monthly data in villars fig 4e appendix table 2 moreover during spring mam correlations of δ18op and regional temperature show positive northwest europe and negative north africa and mediterranean area relationships at both stations fig 4b and f unlike high correlations between local temperature and δ18op on all months fig 3a regional relationships were only reflected in winter and spring figs 3a and 4 the relationship between regional precipitation and δ18op for all the seasons was also considered fig 5 despite the globally much weaker correlations we observed that in winter regional precipitation with 2 5 2 5 global grids and δ18op show similar spatial patterns between regional temperature and δ18op figs 4a e 5a e during spring mam δ18op and regional precipitation show positive patterns with north europe and north african and the mediterranean sea and negative ones all over the european continent fig 5b and f during summer jja and autumn son seasons no or less significant correlations were observed between temperature precipitation and δ18op for both stations figs 4c d g h 5c d g h the degrees of freedom corrections were calculated between the two 20 year time series of δ18op from sw france le mas and villars and the atlantic sst with 5 5 global grids fig 6 the result shows that δ18op values are positively correlated with sst in the gulf stream of mexico fig 6b f and opposite to sst in northern and southern of north atlantic inducing tripolar sst distributions in the north atlantic in spring however during other seasons no or less significant correlations were observed between sst and δ18op for both stations fig 6a c d e g h note that whether we consider patterns of δ18op and european temperature or precipitation in le mas and villars stations in winter and spring it is similar to spatial patterns between nao phase and european temperature precipitation cassou et al 2004 baldini et al 2008 figs 4a e 5a e the link between nao index and δ18op seems to be confirmed by their high correlations p 0 01 or p 0 05 in winter r 0 45 and r 0 42 and spring r 0 33 and r 0 36 fig 7 a d 4 2 relationships between δ18op and initial moisture sources on the monthly timescale in order to localize moisture sources of the rainfall the percentage of initial moisture pims in villars station we first used the hysplit software for periods of high summer and low winter δ18op fig 8 results show a clear seasonal variability in the back trajectories with much longer pathways in december january and february compared to the summer months june july and august fig 8 during winter some vapor sources reach areas clearly beyond the 60 w meridian while in summer the extreme west sources are significantly closer to villars around the extreme east of canada fig 8d 8e 8f but when replaced in the spatial pattern of fig 1 and looking at actual percentages given by the software calculation table 2 it appears that water vapor sources in winter are mostly distributed in the region of nagr west north atlantic north america and greenland characterized by the longer transportation table 2 fig 8a c while in summer it is mostly from the closest source pawe proximal atlantic and west europe table 2 fig 8d f these results show that mositure sources characterized by the pims and rainfall δ18op in sw france are characterized by a well marked seasonality negative δ18op excursions occur in winter when there is a longer initial moisture location e g nagr table 2 fig 8a c on the contrary the δ18op in summer shows positive δ18op excursions which coincides with the closer initial moisture location e g pawe table 2 fig 8d f during spring and autumn there is no obvious contrasted pims fig 9 we however note that pims in the near summer months e g may and september is derived from the increased closer moisture source pawe and the decreased longer moisture source nagr corresponding to heavier values of δ18op and δdp table 2 and appendix table 2 fig 9c d in contrast in the near winter months e g march and november pims from the closer source e g pawe is decreased and the longer source is increased e g nagr table 2 fig 9a f indicating that the change of pims can regulate the δ18op on the monthly timescale in sw france these results highlight close relationships between pims and δ18op values at villars and le mas a high pims from closer regions e g pawe and na is related to heavier δ18op values while the high pims from farther regions e g nagr is related to lower δ18op values table 2 appendix table 2 linear equations have been established for le mas and villars stations to quantify relationships between δ18op and pims table 3 results show positive relationships p 0 01 or p 0 05 between δ18op and pims in the region of pawe and na and negative relationships p 0 01 between δ18op and pims in the region of nagr whereas the rest of regions me and da have much less impact on δ18op values table 3 4 3 relationships between δ18op d excess and initial moisture sources local climate parameters on the annual and inter annual timescale on the annual timescale positive relationships p 0 05 in both le mas and villars stations were observed between the annual average δ18op δ18oap and annual mean temperature with a t δ18oap gradients of 0 42 c and 0 51 c respectively these values fallen in the range of observed gradients from global continental marine and polar sites 0 17 c to 0 9 c clark and fritz 1999 fig 10 a b at the opposite p δ18oap gradients are low 0 1 100 mm and 0 07 100 mm for le mas and villars and no significant correlations p 0 1 were observed fig 10c d the locations of pims were determined using 5 days reconstruction of air mass history during 1997 2016 table 4 fig 11 curiously nagr and pawe are the principal moisture sources i e roughly 60 while na and da are substantial contributors i e roughly 34 and the rest of regions me and nesa have little impact at least for the 1997 2016 period table 4 fig 11 on the annual timescale annual average values for δ18o and δd δ18oap and δdap were calculated for the same period fig 12 a appendix table 3 annual δ18oap value at le mas and villars stations varies from 5 38 to 7 24 and 5 16 to 7 09 respectively appendix table 3 the annual weighted δ18op means δ18ow range from 4 63 to 7 00 and 4 69 to 6 79 for le mas and villars respectively appendix table 3 whereas the δ18op has a significant variation at the monthly timescale it is much lower on the inter annual timescale appendix tables 2 and 3 we also determine correlations between pims and mean annual precipitation isotope compositions δ18oap and δ18ow for the 1997 2016 period fig 12 table 4 and appendix table 2 results show clear trends from the time series of stable isotopes in le mas and villars fig 12a b δ18ow and δ18oap display decreasing trends for both stations le mas and villars on the 1997 2016 studied period which coincides with i the decreasing trends of initial moisture sources pims of closer regions e g pawe and na fig 12c d and ii the increasing trends of pims of longer pathways e g da and nagr fig 12e f however weak or less inter annual variations for local temperature and precipitation were observed over the past 20 year fig 12g h in consequence it appears that most of the inter annual variability of the rainfall isotopic composition δ18op is controlled by variations of the proportion of different sources characterized by pims trends the term of d excess was firstly defined by dansgaard 1964 as the following equation d excess δd 8 δ18o illustrating the degree of deviation from the equilibrium of isotopic fractionation caused by the kinetic fractionation in the evaporation of vapors dansgaard 1964 rainfall d excess exhibited weak inter annual increasing trends in villars and le mas over the past 20 years and the value range from 17 6 to 9 0 with the average value being 10 6 for le mas and 17 6 to 1 7 with the average value being 9 5 for villars respectively fig 13 a b which is close to the value of 10 for the average of global precipitation annual variation of d excess coincides with increasing trends of pims of longer pathways e g da and nagr and a weak increasing trend in local temperature fig 13a e 5 discussions 5 1 causes of the variations of precipitation isotope δ18op δdp in sw france whether considering the monthly or inter annual timescale it appears that δ18op of both le mas and villars stations follow variations of pims and local temperature several factors may be raised to explain the δ18op variability i the length of the water vapor transportation route which plays an important role on the rayleigh fractionation process ii the initial mean seawater δ18o δ18osw values may be different iii the removal of moisture from an air mass is temperature dependent during rayleigh fractionation and the progressive condensation of the vapor requires the cooling of the air mass from the vapor of cloud to the falling rain iaea working group 2000 5 1 1 amount effect and temperature effect compared with global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 we observed that there are lower slopes and lower intercepts in the lmwl of the two monitoring sites le mas and villars fig 2c genty et al 2014 this is a general case for continental stations iaea working group 2000 and may be attributed to evaporation during the process of precipitation under the clouds and various complex phenomena linked to the history of rainfall dansgaard 1964 stewart 1975 gat 1996 peng et al 2005 yamanaka et al 2007 lachniet 2009 pang et al 2011 chen et al 2015 fig 2c positive correlations were observed between δ18op and local monthly annual mean temperature figs 3a 10a b in le mas and villars the main reason is that the air mass after leaving from the moisture source is dominated by rayleigh fractionation processes temperature and rain out dependent dansgaard 1954 1964 bowen 2008 water vapor in the atmosphere is difficult to isothermally condense and any progress of atmospheric precipitation is caused by a temperature cooling dansgaard 1954 1964 when the condensed water is formed then leaving water vapor immediately the stable isotope ratio is depleted in the condensed water with the decreasing of temperature dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 lachniet 2009 no significant correlations were observed between mean annual precipitation and δ18op suggesting no amount effect at the le mas and villars stations figs 3b 10c 10d genty et al 2014 additionally krklec and domínguez villar 2014 who conducted a monitoring work of δ18op in central spain proposing that all climate parameters with a seasonal cycle s characterization would exhibit a certain link with δ18op however when monitoring the relationship between single precipitation event and δ18op these links are not visible krklec and domínguez villar 2014 further indicating that the amount of precipitation is not affecting the δ18op 5 1 2 moisture source effect the transportation distances between moisture sources and the monitoring site latitude effect have already shown an important control on the δ18op aggarwal et al 2004 breitenbach et al 2010 chen and li 2018 based on the rayleigh fractionation process governing these links the increasing moisture transportation distances may result in depleted δ18op value field 2010 krklec and domínguez villar 2014 krklec et al 2018 in winter months the principal initial moisture sources derive from a longer source nagr in comparison with the summer season characterized by a closer moisture source pawe fig 8 the precipitation that occur during the migration of moisture are enriched in 18o leading to an impoverishment of remaining vapor and then resulting in a lower δ18op araguás araguás et al 2000 breitenbach et al 2010 cai et al 2016 therefore the longer the depression pathway the lower δ18op value araguás araguás et al 2000 lee fung 2008 risi et al 2008 lachniet et al 2009 kurita 2013 cai et al 2017 the mechanism is similar with the continental effect where the rain out above the continent is the cause of impoverishment of the δ18o with increasing distances from the ocean but very variable i e from region to region and from season to season iaea working group 2000 besides the discrepancy of initial mean sea water δ18osw value is also an important factor controlling the variation of δ18op values in sw france rozanski et al 1993 clark and fritz 1997 cole et al 1999 friedman et al 2002 most of moisture sources in villars and le mas come from two main areas nagr in winter and pawe in summer because the mean δ18osw in the nagr area 4 0 to 0 legrande and schmidt 2006 is lower than the one in the pawe area from 0 to 1 5 legrande and schmidt 2006 it may also be a significant contribution to the observed δ18op variations an important phenomenon appears at the inter annual timescale where changes of the δ18ow and δ18oap follow the inter annual initial locations of moisture sources fig 12 caused by rayleigh fractionation process and initial moisture sources figs 11 and 12 previous works have revealed that the δ18od drip water δ18o inherited the signal of atmospheric precipitation on the monthly timescale and the influence of the mixing effect with old water in the epikarst zone pape et al 2010 li et al 2011 partin et al 2013 zhang and li 2019 seriously damp or even suppress the rainfall seasonal characteristics e g heavier in summer and lighter in winter genty et al 2014 however other studies indicated that the δ18od and δ18oc can respond to the signal of δ18ow on the interannual timescale chen and li 2018 ellis et al 2020 our results show that the inter annual δ18op and δdp variations are controlled by the mean annual change of the initial location of moisture sources providing new insights to explain climatic significance of oxygen isotope of drip water and stalagmites on the interannual timescale in villars cave 5 2 variations of d excess on the annual timescale it is generally believed that d excess is sensitive to moisture source conditions pfahl and wernli 2008 pfahl and sodemann 2014 therefore which is suitable for assessing the origin of water vapor moreover some studies have proposed that high and increasing d excess values reflect the fast evaporation low rh and stronger kinetic isotope effects during evaporation clark and fritz 1997 dublyansky et al 2018 the linear variations of d excess and pims of longer pathways da and nagr exhibit increasing trends in le mas and villars fig 13a d reflecting enhanced evaporations and stronger kinetic isotope effects in the transportation of vapor while moisture sources from longer pathways were increased over the entire period clark and fritz 1997 pfahl and wernli 2008 dublyansky et al 2018 the increasing of air temperature at the monitoring stations over the past 20 years leads to the enhancement of water vapor evaporation inducing the rising of precipitation d excess fig 13a b e hence our results suggest that the d excess variations in paleo record e g ice cores should be adapted to reflect moisture sources characterized by atmospheric circulations and local temperature 5 3 links between nao and δ18op in sw france during a positive phase of the nao a large pressure gradient between the azores high pressure and iceland low pressure across the north atlantic creates higher winter temperatures and precipitation over the atlantic and northern europe while it is lower over the mediterranean sea and north africa hurrell 1995 1996 vo 2003 the exactly opposite pattern in the negative nao phase is found when the pressure gradient between azores and iceland decreases by shifting southwards on the northern hemisphere westerly jet stream hurrell 1995 nao in different phase plays an important role in the length of water vapor transportation in winter and spring baldini et al 2008 when winter and spring nao index is in the positive excursion warmer westerly winds will carry 18o moisture with a shorter transportation distance resulting in heavier δ18op values in sw france baldini et al 2008 langebroek et al 2011 therefore nao index and δ18op exhibit positive correlations fig 7a d however nao only takes a strengthened or weakened effect on the length of water vapor transportation in winter baldini et al 2008 which will not change the fact that most of winter moisture sources distributed in the region of longer distance west north atlantic north america and greenland section 4 2 krklec and domínguez villar 2014 the isotopic time series at the seasonal timescales show correlations with nao index providing a useful nao proxy δ18op to indicate the variation in the seasonal paleo nao index however when it comes to the relationship between nao and δ18op in the inter annual timescale a particularly weak correlation p 0 1 was found 5 4 quantifying the relationship between pims temperature and δ18op in sw france the variation of pims and local temperature have been identified as important contributors to the observed δ18op changes in sw france therefore combining the link between pims temperature and δ18op several equations were established using multiple linear regression analysis methods as followed for le mas station 1 δ18op 0 038 pawe 0 046 na 0 054 me 0 02 da 0 025 nagr 0 119 t 10 929 r 0 965 p 0 01 where δ18op indicates precipitation δ18o v smow and t c indicate the local monthly temperature in le mas for villars station 2 δ18op 0 035 pawe 0 031 na 0 054 me 0 001 da 0 005 nagr 0 049 t 8 637 r 0 942 p 0 05 where δ18op indicates precipitation δ18o v smow and t c indicate the local monthly temperature in villars these two equations allow us to evaluate the importance of the factors pims and temperature on the δ18op variability results show that the following factors influence the δ18op in the order on importances temperature nagr pawe na da me at the monthly timescale we use the spss software to calculate the variance of contribution rate and the proportion in the four main principal components are 60 6 temperature 16 6 nagr 15 4 pawe 6 2 na the rest of two component da and me is 2 therefore in any case considering the range of variability of various contributions from different moisture source regions and local temperature it is obviously found that local temperature is the principal variable controlling the oxygen isotope composition of precipitation in the continental european at the monthly timescale in addition adding the different variables step by step and look at the results we found that the multiple linear regression is more accurate to describe the relationship between isotopes and water vapor sources and air temperature compared to linear regression methods appendix table 4 the use of hysplit model for tracking moisture sources is providing a good example for how to accurately calculate the relationship between δ18op and moisture sources different from regional general circulation models of the δ18op cruz san julian et al 1992 celle jeanton et al 2001 sodemann et al 2008 this study not only provides the quantified mathematical equations based on the longest isotopic time series and variations of pims over 20 years but also determines the extent of the impact on the monthly timescale additionally speleothem δ18o in the villars cave also recorded a series of abrupt climatic events on the centennial millennial timescales such as dansgaard oeschger heinrich and 8 2 ka events genty et al 2001 2003 2006 genty 2008 wainer et al 2009 2011 2013 genty et al 2014 in this study the long monitoring based work established links between local climate parameters and δ18op which can be used for interpreting the significance of speleothem δ18o no or less correlations were observed between the δ18op and local precipitation indicating that speleothem δ18o in villars cave likely cannot reconstruct local precipitation in contrast changes in δ18op can be linked to the change of moisture sources and to local temperature 6 conclusions based on the observations and models on δ18op and δdp moisture sources and regional local climate parameters during the 1997 2016 period at the le mas and villars meteorological stations sw france the following conclusions can be drawn 1 based on hysplit model we have quantified the percentage of initial moisture sources pims for different months and found shorter transportation distances during summer months and longer ones during winter which is consistent with the observed seasonal variations of δ18op 2 the variations of temperature and pims are important factors that are the main causes on the seasonal variation of δ18op in the order of importances the following factors influence the δ18op temperature nagr pawe na da me and the proportions of four main principal components are 60 6 temperature 16 6 nagr 15 4 pawe 6 2 na on the monthly timescale 3 on the annual timescale δ18op maintains positive relationships with local mean annual temperature however no evidence for its amount effect has been observed 4 on a longer timescale an important result shows that an inter annual decreasing trend was observed for the δ18op δ18oap and δ18ow following the variation of annual pims we observed over the past 20 years that the percentage of the farther moisture source region nagr was increased at the opposite there is a decreasing trend for the closer source pawe 5 the linear trends over the past 20 years of d excess coincide with the variation of pims in longer pathways da and nagr and local temperature on the inter annual timescale which is likely attributed to the rise in global temperature and the change of moisture sources characterized by atmospheric circulation in sw france 6 the variation of moisture distribution regions should be considered when interpreting the

5067,arsenic as concentration in groundwater is one of the worst problems we are facing owing to its carcinogenic effect the problem should therefore be addressed scientifically although groundwater arsenic as enrichment is reported in many basins across the globe still scientists have long way to go in the present study we present new as data in groundwater to understand the processes and aquifer environment responsible for the as mobilization in groundwater of upper jhelum basin western himalayas the groundwater in the unconsolidated aquifers is less mineralized with low electric conductivity moderate ph and is mainly of ca mg hco3 type the results suggest that carbonate dissolution silicate weathering and active cation exchange is controlling the ionic composition of groundwater arsenic as concentration in groundwater showed a wide range 0 14 µg l 1 192 µg l 1 with 45 of water samples having as 10 μg l 1 who guidelines for drinking water the shallow groundwater wells were more as enriched than deep groundwater wells groundwater as showed significant correlation with redox sensitive parameters including fe mn ph nh4 n hco3 and poor correlation with no3 and so4 2 besides the lower slope w r t gmwl and higher isotopic values δ18o and δ2h we observed a significant correlation of δ18o with as ec and cl in shallow groundwater the study suggests that the source of as is from quaternary deposits of unconsolidated aquifers with their provenance from the volcanic sedimentary and metamorphic rocks of himalayan orogeny the as release from these quaternary deposits requires a proper and favorable aquifer environment keywords arsenic redox sensitive δ18o aquifer unconsolidated jhelum 1 introduction groundwater a major freshwater resource after cryosphere plays a significant role in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems the groundwater chemistry depends on the geochemical and mineralogical composition of aquifer matrix and anthropogenic inputs while moving from recharge areas to discharge sites jeelani et al 2014 numerous hydrogeological geochemical and biogeochemical processes operate while its movement through different flow paths which modify its ionic composition mukherjee et al 2019 lone et al 2020 the continuous dissolution of aquifer minerals including trace elements and point source concentration from anthropogenic activities may deteriorate the groundwater chemistry kumar and singh 2020 an enrichment of trace elements particularly arsenic as has become an important problem in different parts of the world ravindra et al 2019 lone et al 2020 the groundwater with as concentration above world health organization standard 10 µg l for drinking can have severe health issues who 2011 however some studies have recently reported that drinking water with as concentration even 10 µg l have severe health effects including lung cancer ahmad et al 2015 2020 human exposure to this carcinogenic trace element is mainly caused due to food air soil and drinking water groundwater being easily available and safe from microbial contamination is widely used for drinking however the presence of dissolved harmful elements has caused serious health issues mukherjee et al 2019 lone et al 2020 an assessment of excessive life time lung cancer due to low level as was carried out in dutch and it observed that the who guidelines 10 µg l is not sufficiently protective ahmad et al 2020 apart from anthropogenic inputs of as in groundwater many workers postulated that the dissolution of sulfidic minerals and as bearing fe mn oxides and oxy hydroxides at high ph leads to as mobilization in oxic and anoxic environment respectively bhattacharya et al 1997 welch et al 2000 mcarthur et al 2004 ahmed et al 2004 mukherjee et al 2008 2009 ravenscroft et al 2009 yu et al 2018 ravindra and mor 2019 kumar and singh 2020 however others suggest that microbially assisted reductive dissolution and reduction of oxidized organic matter utilizing fe oxides oxyhydroxides as electron acceptor is another established phenomenon of as mobilization harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 wen et al 2013 han et al 2013 gan et al 2014 lone et al 2020 therefore the origin and distribution of groundwater as and the processes governing its mobilization is complex and still not fully understood several theories were proposed to understand the sources of global geogenic groundwater as primarily to relate it with plate tectonic activities including orogensis raychowdhury et al 2014 mukherjee et al 2014 mukherjee et al 2019 coomar et al 2019

groundwater across the upper jhelum basin ranged from 0 14 µg l 1 to 192 µg l 1 with an average value of 33 µg l 1 table 1 although most of the samples collected in upper jhelum basin have as concentration above maximum permissible limit of 10 µg l 1 given by world health organization who 2011 but the anomalously higher values were found in northwestern and southeastern parts of the basin kupwara sopore meergund zainpora and marbel like other alluvial basins including ganges and brahmaputra bbs unicef 2011 jia et al 2014 the groundwater as in upper jhelum basin generally decreases with increasing depth 45 of groundwater wells in upper jhelum basin exhibited as concentration above who guidelines for drinking water in shallow wells the groundwater as concentration ranges from 1 5 µg l 1 to 192 µg l 1 with an average of 32 6 µg l 1 however in deep wells the as concentration ranges from 0 14 µg l 1 to 60 µg l 1 with an average of 27 µg l 1 68 shallow wells and 27 deep wells exhibit groundwater as levels 10 µg l 1 based on geology of the region the groundwater as in unconsolidated alluvium and karewa formation varies from 0 14 µg l 1 to 192 µg l 1 and 0 34 µg l 1 to 99 µg l 1 respectively it was observed that 86 wells in alluvium 43 in dilpur formation 67 in hirpur formation 58 in shupiyan member and 72 in pampur member have as concentration above who guidelines for drinking water the statistical summary of selected solutes and trace elements is presented in table 1 5 3 variation of stable water isotopes in groundwater the stable water isotopic values of groundwater ranges from 14 8 to 0 7 for δ18o and 68 to 0 02 for δ2h with an average value of 6 8 and 41 respectively the shallow groundwater was characterized by higher stable water isotopic values mean δ18o 3 4 δd 21 than deep groundwater mean δ18o 7 9 δd 47 the stable water isotopic values of groundwater samples near river jhelum at some places including iqbal park burzihama nowshera hmt sumbal drugmulla pattan kakapora malangpur yarapora bugam gundchahal and devsar have lower but similar stable water isotopic values as that of the river jhelum reflecting the influent nature of the river at these locations these locations are therefore the perennial recharge areas of the unconfined aquifer s we have observed that at these locations groundwater as enrichment is lesser 5 4 relationship of as with redox parameters the poor relationship of as with orp r2 0 13 p 0 05 fig 3a no3 r2 0 05 p 0 37 fig 3b depth r2 0 09 p 0 005 fig 3e so4 2 r2 0 01 p 0 12 fig 3h and eh r2 0 13 p

fig 3d mn r2 0 69 p 0 05 fig 3i and hco3 r2 0 53 p 0 002 fig 3g 6 discussion 6 1 hydrochemistry and sources of solutes the neutral to alkaline groundwater samples with moderate to high ec and tds towards the central and southeastern part of the basin suggested a significant water aquifer matrix interaction the concentration of most of the in situ parameters major ions and trace elements ph ec ca2 hco3 and mn is higher in central and southeastern parts of the basin reflecting the active carbonate weathering and other hydrogeological and geochemical processes in dissolving the aquifer matrix in the headwater of the basin however less concentration of in situ parameters major ions and trace elements except ph hco3 and mn towards northwestern part of the basin may be due to many factors including less water rock interaction the dominance of silicate rocks less residence time of groundwater low intensity of weathering etc carbonate lithology is the dominant lithology towards se of the basin and silicate rocks are dominant towards the nw of the basin fig 1 the concentration of na cl and no3 were higher in some wells located in the center srinagar and surrounding areas and se achabal of the basin suggesting the concentration by anthropogenic activity it is important to mention here that there are many faulty fractured sewer drains in srinagar city which are the point sources of pollution in groundwater the diverse and complex distribution of hydrogeochemical parameters fig 2 suggests that various hydrogeological and geochemical processes control the groundwater chemistry in the upper jhelum basin the ca2 mg2 v s hco3 ca2 mg2 v s hco3 8so4 2 ca2 v s hco3 and na v s cl plots fig 4 a c help to evaluate the possible source of solute in groundwater in ca2 mg2 v s hco3 plot fig 4 a majority of samples from center and se fall along the 1 1 line indicating carbonate lithology is dominantly controlling the ionic composition of groundwater it is also obvious from the piper plot that the 90 of groundwater samples collected in upper jhelum basin are predominantly ca mg hco3 type fig 5 the dissolution of abundant carbonate rocks contributes ca2 mg2 to the groundwater aquifers the common calcite dissolution reaction is gives as ½ ca hco3 equivalence ratio of 1 1 however some samples from center and nw fall below the 1 1 line of ca2 mg2 v s hco3 plot suggests an additional source of major ions including silicates which results in hybrid water type also corroborated by piper diagram this corroborates the above discussion drawn from the spatial variation maps that the dominance of carbonate lithology in se and silicate lithology in nw are controlling the ionic composition of groundwater ca2 and hco3 plot fig 4c shows additional source for hco3 probably mg2 in the form of dolomite dissolution and ca2 possibly gypsum and or clay ca2 mg2 v s hco3 so4 2 plot fig 4b suggest the dissolution of sulphide rich minerals like gypsum it is also clear from the scatter plots that some samples show excess hco3 so4 2 and na which reveals the interaction of groundwater with silicates as well during its movement through different flow paths the silicate weathering of na rich plagioclase and active cation exchange reaction with ca2 attached to the surface of neo formed clay minerals releases na in groundwater resulting in hybrid water types wang et al 2004 han et al 2013 jeelani et al 2014 saleem et al 2015 lone et al 2020 a scatter plot of corrected bivalent cations v s na fig 6 was used to assess the effect of active cation exchange reactions in groundwater the bivariate plots of alluvium hirpur pampur and dilpur had an inclination towards y x 1 1 2 1 and 1 2 indicating a strong impact of active cation exchange reactions on chemistry of these aquifers may be due to longer residence time of groundwater fig 6 however the bivariate plots of shupiyan member had less inclination towards y 1 0 2 reflecting shorter residence time and immature sediments and or higher gradient landscapes this corroborates the above conclusions drawn from the solute chemistry that hybrid water facies results due to active cation exchange reactions on bivalent plots of na normalized ca2 versus na normalized mg2 and hco3 fig 7 the groundwater samples of upper jhelum basin fall between the carbonate and silicate ionic composition suggesting the dissolution of carbonates and weathering of silicates around the basin dominantly control the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater however some samples from nw have high cl concentration reveals an anthropogenic source thus it is clear from the above discussion that the rock types and hydrogeological characteristics such as flow paths dominantly control the ionic composition of groundwater 6 2 geochemical modelling there are several prerequisites for inverse geochemical modeling of evolving chemistry in hydrologic systems sracek et al 2004 there are two principal approaches to geochemical modeling chemical equilibrium and chemical kinetics the equilibrium approach is the most common and assumes very fast instantaneous reactions compared to groundwater residence time sracek et al 2004 based on chemical equilibrium modelling the calculated saturation index si values indicate that the groundwater across upper jhelum basin is undersaturated si 0 with respect to calcite caco3 dolomite mgca co3 2 pyrolusite mno2 manganite mno oh rhodochrosite mnco3 arsenolite as4o6 and arsenic pentoxide as2o5 mineral phases the results suggested that these mineral are present in dissolved state and are thermodynamically unstable however most of the groundwater samples are supersaturated si 0 with respect to hematite fe2o3 and magnetite fe3o4 indicating that these mineral phases precipitate as fe iii and these are thermodynamically stable the eh ph plot fig 8 a and b where most of the samples fall in arsenous acid as oh 3 field and few plot at the boundary between arsenous acid as oh 3 and hydrogen arsenate haso4 2 suggesting arsenite as iii as dominant phase than arsenate as v in the groundwater the concentration of most of the samples in ferrous ion fe2 field and a few samples near hematite fe2o3 stability zone indicates that under reducing conditions the groundwater samples are mainly in equilibrium with fe ii phase 6 3 processes favoring arsenic release the groundwater as concentration in upper jhelum basin is undocumented and unexplored groundwater as showed a significantly positive correlation with fe and mn fig 3 suggesting as mobility across upper jhelum basin is governed by redox sensitive parameters and plays a dominant role in as release the correlation between as and orp suggests redox condition is an important factor controlling as mobilization the poor correlation of no3 and so4 2 cl ratio also corroborates with redox dependent mobilization of as a significant positive correlation of as enriched groundwater and nh4 n r2 0 61 suggests that the microbial degradation of dissolved organic carbon also plays an important role in as release in oxic environment as forms a thin layer on fe minerals thus liberating little as in groundwater which is substantiated by the least correlation of as with no3 fig 3b in so4 2 reduction stage the continuous dissolution of fe causes a significant increase in fe and as minerals in groundwater which is corroborated by significantly positive correlation of as with fe fig 3d however the lower concentration of so4 2 and no3 concentration in groundwater reveals that denitrification and sulfate decline occurs in aquifers with increase in as which is substantiated by inverse correlation of as with so4 2 because as in so4 2 minerals are easily extractable and weakly sorbed guo et al 2014 jia et al 2014 the release of high hco3 concentration from sediment surfaces is an important process liable for as mobilization in groundwater which strives for adhesion on the surface of fe mineral phases biswas et al 2014 duan et al 2015 the hco3 readily competes for adsorption sites on the hematite at higher concentration although low concentrations of hco3 enhance as adsorption lone et al 2020 some previous studies have indicated that the replacement of as by hco3 from the sediment surfaces is an important mechanism of as mobilization bhattacharya et al 2002 mukherjee et al 2009 however the results obtained illustrated that few samples have less as and higher hco3 concentration revealing that high hco3 has a lesser impact on as adsorption the ph exhibited a significantly positive correlation with as fig 3c suggesting that high ph values favors the mobilization of as in groundwater in high ph conditions the surface of sediments containing as and fe minerals becomes negatively charged and causes electrostatic repulsion which declines as adsorption on fe mineral phases and leads to as release guo et al 2014 lone et al 2020 kumar and singh 2020 the presence of sulphide minerals such as arsenian pyrite and arsenopyrite associated with volcanic sedimentary and metamorphic rocks of upper jhelum basin are very common and well known primary geogenic as containing minerals the geochemical analysis of different rock types and unconsolidated sediments also revealed the presence of as across upper jhelum basin arsenic concentration in unconsolidated sediments of upper jhelum basin ranges from 04 mg kg 1 to 22 mg kg 1 bhat et al 2019 a significant proportion of iron and manganese mineral in sediments come from the parent rock but various minerals are formed during and after the deposition and compaction of unconsolidated material these oxides and hydroxides co precipitates and consequently imbibe various trace elements including as during the disintegration and decomposition of other iron and manganese minerals therefore it is clear from the above discussion that the redox sensitive parameters are dominantly controlling the as liberation and mobilization in groundwater of upper jhelum basin besides some biogeochemical processes also support as mobilization and release 6 4 isotope geochemistry stable water isotopic values of groundwater have been broadly used to identify and estimate the sources of water recharging groundwater system clark and fritz 1997 jeelani et al 2017 lone et al 2019 the stable water isotopic composition of groundwater can be significantly modified from that of local precipitation due to the stable water isotopic enrichment in water during evaporation the groundwater that have undergone evaporation exhibits systematic enrichment in stable water isotopic values resulting in divergence from the lmwl along evaporation lines that have lower slopes it was observed that the slope 5 4 of regression equation of shallow groundwater samples is lower than slope 7 9 of lmwl jeelani et al 2017 and gmwl fig 9 this suggests that the water recharging the shallow wells have undergone evaporation however the deep groundwater samples have slope 7 9 similar to lmwl and gmwl suggesting no evaporation effect some shallow groundwater samples collected from kupwara sopore meergund zainpora and marbel villages of northwestern and southeastern part of basin have higher stable water isotopic values mean δ18o 2 1 suggesting an intense evaporation effect the groundwater which undergoes evaporation shows positive correlation between δ18o and ec it was observed from the plot of δ18o v s ec fig 10 a that the water samples collected from shallow groundwater samples shows significantly positive correlation r2 0 71 indicates that evaporated surface water is recharging the shallow aquifers or direct evaporation of shallow groundwater takes place during summer season most parts of the upper jhelum basin remains waterlogged due to dominance of agricultural fields the percolation of irrigation return flow waters enriched in stable water isotopes and major ions leads to increase in the electrical conductivity of shallow aquifers further due to low gradient of the basin the areas around rivers streams are water logged and the depth to water table is 1m therefore the shallow aquifers are more vulnerable to evaporation further the increase in temperature of shallow groundwater may increase the rock water interaction and therefore facilitate the release of as and other trace elements to groundwater to further understand the processes responsible for as concentration in shallow aquifers of upper jhelum basin we plotted the δ18o with cl and as fig 10 b c the significant positive correlation of as with δ18o and cl in shallow groundwater fig 10 indicates the shallow groundwater is recharged by evaporated agrochemical and fertilizer rich waters which contain higher concentration as and cl the groundwater samples collected from northwestern and southeastern parts of the basin have lower but similar stable water isotopic values as that of the river jhelum reflecting the influent nature of the river at these locations these locations are therefore the perennial recharge areas of the unconfined aquifer s it was observed that these sites contain lesser concentration of as which is attributed to dilution of groundwater and increase in oxic conditions not favoring as release the discharge in the stream water bodies across upper jhelum basin is dominantly controlled by the glacier and snowmelt throughout the year the temperature of these melt waters is very less which does not facilities the temperature dependent reaction for the release of major ion and trace elements which could be one of the reasons for less as concentration in these groundwater aquifers the poor correlation of as with ec and cl in deep groundwater fig 10c indicates negligible anthropogenic concentration 6 5 conceptual model depicting sources of arsenic the collision of indian plate with the eurasian plate in early cenozoic led to formation of neotethys and closure of paleotethys mukherjee et al 2014 2019 the palaeo tethys ocean consisting dozens of tectonically active fragments with both constructive and destructive plate boundaries mukherjee et al 2014 2019 at destructive plate margins structural disturbance of the leaping foredeep normally occurs due to enduring movement of distortion away from the axis of the orogen within the evolving schuppen structure intermontane basins may be formed the pir panjal and zanskar thrust bounds the intermontane basin kashmir valley in nw se directions respectively fig 11 a along the greater himalaya and pir panjal ranges the intermontane basin kashmir valley forms two major axes of orogenic upheaval fig 11a its geographical location and the structural disposition is the outcome of the great himalayan formation the kashmir himalayas consists of paleozoic and mesozoic sediments of oceanic origin rich in as and other trace elements overlies the precambrian rock belonging to the continental crust of indian plate it has been postulated that the as mobilization from the sediments deposited on under thrusting plate to the metamorphic hydrothermal fluids are most effective in continental provinces raychowdhury et al 2014 mukherjee et al 2019 the eroded material brought down by gravitational forces and fluvial channels from the himalayan mountains are accumulated and deposited within the intermontane basin fig 11b these sediment deposits are the result of physico chemical disintegration and decomposition of mafic and ultramafic rocks rich in as concentration during its transport through different flowpaths as from aquifer matrix is released under oxic as well as anoxic conditions thus contaminating the groundwater in shallow wells and recharge areas o2 enriched water becomes more suitable for as v release while as in deep aquifers the reducing conditions favors as iii release mukherjee et al 2019 lone et al 2020 hence it can be suggested that the tectonic framework and lithological settings of greater himalaya and pir panjal mountains rich in as surrounding the upper jhelum basin provides the major source of as enrichment in the quaternary sediment deposits karewas and alluvium which is released in groundwater under favorable conditions basin scale to local scale groundwater flow systems originating in the himalayan foothills transport the dissolved as under reduced redox conditions in organic carbon enriched young alluvial aquifers of the upper jhelum basin and downstream the study suggested that the groundwater in upper jhelum basin is unsafe for drinking the consequence of as enriched groundwater on the health of people in upper jhelum basin is quite noticeable 7000 cancer patients are admitted every year in which 28 of patients are reported to having stomach neurological cardiovascular and respiratory disorders qurieshi et al 2016 which could be due to exposure of people to as enriched groundwater thus the carcinogenic effect of as and other trace elements on health of people in upper jhelum basin needs to be investigated properly 7 conclusion the groundwater as in unconsolidated aquifers of upper jhelum basin ranges from 0 14 µg l 1 to 192 µg l 1 out of this 45 of samples show as level above who guideline for drinking water 10 µg l 1 the study suggested that the groundwater as enrichment is higher 68 in shallow wells 3m the significant correlation of as with ph fe mn and hco3 suggested that the as mobility is governed by redox sensitive parameters and arsenite as the dominant phase under reducing conditions the study also suggests that microbial degradation of dissolved organic carbon doc is an important biogeochemical process favoring as release in groundwater the sites recharged by river jhelum with lower isotopic values have lower as concentration reflecting the dilution effect and the increase in oxic conditions which do not favor as release the study revealed that the tectonic framework and lithological settings of greater himalaya and pir panjal mountains surrounding the upper jhelum basin provides the major source of as enrichment in the quaternary sediment deposits karewas and alluvium which is released in groundwater under favorable conditions basin scale to local scale groundwater flow system originating in upper jhelum basin transports the dissolved as under reduced conditions to downstream thus contaminating the aquifers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
5067,arsenic as concentration in groundwater is one of the worst problems we are facing owing to its carcinogenic effect the problem should therefore be addressed scientifically although groundwater arsenic as enrichment is reported in many basins across the globe still scientists have long way to go in the present study we present new as data in groundwater to understand the processes and aquifer environment responsible for the as mobilization in groundwater of upper jhelum basin western himalayas the groundwater in the unconsolidated aquifers is less mineralized with low electric conductivity moderate ph and is mainly of ca mg hco3 type the results suggest that carbonate dissolution silicate weathering and active cation exchange is controlling the ionic composition of groundwater arsenic as concentration in groundwater showed a wide range 0 14 µg l 1 192 µg l 1 with 45 of water samples having as 10 μg l 1 who guidelines for drinking water the shallow groundwater wells were more as enriched than deep groundwater wells groundwater as showed significant correlation with redox sensitive parameters including fe mn ph nh4 n hco3 and poor correlation with no3 and so4 2 besides the lower slope w r t gmwl and higher isotopic values δ18o and δ2h we observed a significant correlation of δ18o with as ec and cl in shallow groundwater the study suggests that the source of as is from quaternary deposits of unconsolidated aquifers with their provenance from the volcanic sedimentary and metamorphic rocks of himalayan orogeny the as release from these quaternary deposits requires a proper and favorable aquifer environment keywords arsenic redox sensitive δ18o aquifer unconsolidated jhelum 1 introduction groundwater a major freshwater resource after cryosphere plays a significant role in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems the groundwater chemistry depends on the geochemical and mineralogical composition of aquifer matrix and anthropogenic inputs while moving from recharge areas to discharge sites jeelani et al 2014 numerous hydrogeological geochemical and biogeochemical processes operate while its movement through different flow paths which modify its ionic composition mukherjee et al 2019 lone et al 2020 the continuous dissolution of aquifer minerals including trace elements and point source concentration from anthropogenic activities may deteriorate the groundwater chemistry kumar and singh 2020 an enrichment of trace elements particularly arsenic as has become an important problem in different parts of the world ravindra et al 2019 lone et al 2020 the groundwater with as concentration above world health organization standard 10 µg l for drinking can have severe health issues who 2011 however some studies have recently reported that drinking water with as concentration even 10 µg l have severe health effects including lung cancer ahmad et al 2015 2020 human exposure to this carcinogenic trace element is mainly caused due to food air soil and drinking water groundwater being easily available and safe from microbial contamination is widely used for drinking however the presence of dissolved harmful elements has caused serious health issues mukherjee et al 2019 lone et al 2020 an assessment of excessive life time lung cancer due to low level as was carried out in dutch and it observed that the who guidelines 10 µg l is not sufficiently protective ahmad et al 2020 apart from anthropogenic inputs of as in groundwater many workers postulated that the dissolution of sulfidic minerals and as bearing fe mn oxides and oxy hydroxides at high ph leads to as mobilization in oxic and anoxic environment respectively bhattacharya et al 1997 welch et al 2000 mcarthur et al 2004 ahmed et al 2004 mukherjee et al 2008 2009 ravenscroft et al 2009 yu et al 2018 ravindra and mor 2019 kumar and singh 2020 however others suggest that microbially assisted reductive dissolution and reduction of oxidized organic matter utilizing fe oxides oxyhydroxides as electron acceptor is another established phenomenon of as mobilization harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 wen et al 2013 han et al 2013 gan et al 2014 lone et al 2020 therefore the origin and distribution of groundwater as and the processes governing its mobilization is complex and still not fully understood several theories were proposed to understand the sources of global geogenic groundwater as primarily to relate it with plate tectonic activities including orogensis raychowdhury et al 2014 mukherjee et al 2014 mukherjee et al 2019 coomar et al 2019 lone et al 2020 arsenic enriched in himalayan basins and sub basins aquifers have been linked with formation of himalayas guillot and charlet 2007 mukherjee et al 2014 verma et al 2015 the quaternary and recent age unconsolidated alluvial fluvial and lake deposits of these basins host the as enriched aquifers bhattacharya et al 2001 ahmed et al 2004 as a consequence of complicated hydrogeological guo et al 2014 and biogeochemical processes fendorf et al 2010 gan et al 2014 the as concentration in groundwater is broadly distributed across the sedimentary basins of the world including the himalayan basins indus ganges brahmaputra etc fendorf et al 2010 gan et al 2014 mukherjee et al 2014 verma et al 2015 diaz et al 2016 ravindra and mor 2019 kumar and singh 2020 this is the first detailed investigation of as in shallow groundwaters of upper jhelum basin the objectives of the study were to assess the hydrogeochemical evolution and to understand the processes and aquifer environment responsible for the as release in groundwater 2 study site the kashmir valley also known as upper jhelum basin is nw se oriented sedimentary basin bounded by mountain ranges of the greater himalayas and lesser himalayas it lies between the latitude 33 25 n and 34 32 n and longitude 74 0 e and 75 30 e covers an area of about 12 757 km2 the circulation of western disturbances and indian

basin lone 2016 the karewa deposits visible in the river valleys and the plateau margins of the upper jhelum basin comprise of clay silt and sand beds with occasional boulder beds karewa deposits has been divided into three formations the lower hirpur formation the middle nagum formation and the upper dilpur formation due to shifting of lake from northwestern pir panjal side to himalayan southeast side bhat et al 1989 jaan et al 2015 the formations were further divided into sub types based on the litho stratigraphy the lower karewa consists of three sub types as dubjan member rambiara member and methawoin member and the upper karewa consists of shupiyan member pampur member and krungus members respectively bhat et al 1989 the quaternary sediments of the karewa group along with the recent

basin gives rise to a diversity of groundwater conditions the basin is filled with quaternary sediments of pleistocene and recent age overlying igneous and sedimentary formations fig 1 the depth to watertable in quaternary sediments with low gradient slope of upper jhelum basin varies from 0 67 mbgl to 9 06 mbgl cgwb 2018 the upper jhelum basin is tectonically active comprising of volcanic sedimentary and metamorphic rocks with intense tectonic features being part of the himalayas it has a complex tectonic history consisting of diversified rocks that are folded faulted and jointed groundwater in upper jhelum basin occurs in primary rock sequences as well as in quaternary sediments alluvium and karewas jeelani 2008a 2008b the pleistocene to holocene formations including the alluvium and karewas are the chief unconsolidated quaternary deposits the groundwater in karewas occurs under both confined and unconfined conditions the lacustrine sediments overlap and are interspersed with fluvial sediments forming confining layers as well as consequently produce artesian conditions the gravity surveys supported by refraction surveys carried out in upper jhelum basin indicates their maximum thickness as 2000 m resting on triassic limestone or panjal traps jeelani 2008a 2008b the undulating topography with sub horizontal to nearly gradational nature of the unconsolidated karewa deposits as well as recurrence of clay sand and boulder beds decreases the probability of existence of prospective aquifers jeelani 2008a 2008b the secondary porosity developed due to weathering and tectonic activities in volcanic and sedimentary rocks makes it a productive groundwater aquifer a number of perennial springs with a discharge of not exceeding 20 l s emanate through it the perennial and less fluctuating discharge of the springs reflects the productivity of the aquifer various types of upper permian to lower triassic limestone middlemiss 1910 wadia 1975 lone et al 2016 shah and lone 2019 cover a large area of upper jhelum basin these rocks have been subjected to tectonic disturbances through geological time with the evolution of himalayas resulting into the deformation in the form of fractures the fractures in the triassic limestone have progressively developed to karst due to solution action the perennial nature and less fluctuating discharge of these springs indicates the extent of development of karstification and productivity of the formation jeelani 2005 2008a the groundwater from these massive sedimentary rocks oozes out as natural springs from secondary fractures with a high discharge of 2 3 m3 s jeelani 2005 2008a 2008b 4 materials and methods groundwater samples n 160 were collected from wells and freshwater springs in upper jhelum basin for hydrogeochemical and stable water isotopic analysis fig 1 the samples from the groundwater wells were collected typically after 20 min of well purging the wells were classified as shallow 3m and deep 3m depending upon the depth to water table measured using groundwater level indicator the groundwater samples were filtered using neucleopore filter paper with a mesh size of 0 22 μm the groundwater samples were collected in 30 ml hdpe bottles separately for cations and anions the samples collected for cations and trace elements were acidified with 6 n hno3 while as anion

groundwater across the upper jhelum basin ranged from 0 14 µg l 1 to 192 µg l 1 with an average value of 33 µg l 1 table 1 although most of the samples collected in upper jhelum basin have as concentration above maximum permissible limit of 10 µg l 1 given by world health organization who 2011 but the anomalously higher values were found in northwestern and southeastern parts of the basin kupwara sopore meergund zainpora and marbel like other alluvial basins including ganges and brahmaputra bbs unicef 2011 jia et al 2014 the groundwater as in upper jhelum basin generally decreases with increasing depth 45 of groundwater wells in upper jhelum basin exhibited as concentration above who guidelines for drinking water in shallow wells the groundwater as concentration ranges from 1 5 µg l 1 to 192 µg l 1 with an average of 32 6 µg l 1 however in deep wells the as concentration ranges from 0 14 µg l 1 to 60 µg l 1 with an average of 27 µg l 1 68 shallow wells and 27 deep wells exhibit groundwater as levels 10 µg l 1 based on geology of the region the groundwater as in unconsolidated alluvium and karewa formation varies from 0 14 µg l 1 to 192 µg l 1 and 0 34 µg l 1 to 99 µg l 1 respectively it was observed that 86 wells in alluvium 43 in dilpur formation 67 in hirpur formation 58 in shupiyan member and 72 in pampur member have as concentration above who guidelines for drinking water the statistical summary of selected solutes and trace elements is presented in table 1 5 3 variation of stable water isotopes in groundwater the stable water isotopic values of

mean δ18o 3 4 δd 21 than deep groundwater mean δ18o 7 9 δd 47 the stable water isotopic values of groundwater samples near river jhelum at some places including iqbal park burzihama nowshera hmt sumbal drugmulla pattan kakapora malangpur yarapora bugam gundchahal and devsar have lower but similar stable water isotopic values as that of the river jhelum reflecting the influent nature of the river at these locations these locations are therefore the perennial recharge areas of the unconfined aquifer s we have observed that at these locations groundwater as enrichment is lesser 5 4 relationship of as with redox parameters the poor relationship of as with orp r2 0 13 p 0 05 fig 3a no3 r2 0 05 p 0 37 fig 3b depth r2 0 09 p 0 005 fig 3e so4 2 r2 0 01 p 0 12 fig 3h and eh r2 0 13 p

fig 3d mn r2 0 69 p 0 05 fig 3i and hco3 r2 0 53 p 0 002 fig 3g 6 discussion 6 1 hydrochemistry and sources of solutes the neutral to alkaline groundwater samples with moderate to high ec and tds towards the central and southeastern part of the basin suggested a significant water aquifer matrix interaction the concentration of most of the in situ parameters major ions and trace elements ph ec ca2 hco3 and mn is higher in central and southeastern parts of the basin reflecting the active carbonate weathering and other hydrogeological and geochemical processes in dissolving the aquifer matrix in the headwater of the basin however less concentration of in situ parameters major ions and trace elements except ph hco3 and mn towards northwestern part of the basin may be due to many factors including less water rock interaction the dominance of silicate rocks less residence time of groundwater low intensity of weathering etc carbonate lithology is the dominant lithology towards se of the basin and silicate rocks are dominant towards the nw of the basin fig 1 the concentration of na cl and no3 were higher in some wells located in the center srinagar and surrounding areas and se achabal of the basin suggesting the concentration by anthropogenic activity it is important to mention here that there are many faulty fractured sewer drains in srinagar city which are the point sources of pollution in groundwater the diverse and complex distribution of hydrogeochemical parameters fig 2 suggests that various hydrogeological and geochemical processes control the groundwater chemistry in the upper jhelum basin the ca2 mg2 v s hco3 ca2 mg2 v s hco3 8so4 2 ca2 v s hco3 and na v s cl plots fig 4 a c help to evaluate the possible source of solute in groundwater in ca2 mg2 v s hco3 plot fig 4 a majority of samples from center and se fall along the 1 1 line indicating carbonate lithology is dominantly controlling the ionic composition of groundwater it is also obvious from the piper plot that the 90 of groundwater samples collected in upper jhelum basin are predominantly ca mg hco3 type fig 5 the dissolution of abundant carbonate rocks contributes ca2 mg2 to the groundwater aquifers the common calcite dissolution reaction is gives as ½ ca hco3 equivalence ratio of 1 1 however some samples from center and nw fall below the 1 1 line of ca2 mg2 v s hco3 plot suggests an additional source of major ions including silicates which results in hybrid water type also corroborated by piper diagram this corroborates the above discussion drawn from the spatial variation maps that the dominance of carbonate lithology in se and silicate lithology in nw are controlling the ionic composition of groundwater ca2 and hco3 plot fig 4c shows additional source for hco3 probably mg2 in the form of dolomite dissolution and ca2 possibly gypsum and or clay ca2 mg2 v s hco3 so4 2 plot fig 4b suggest the dissolution of sulphide rich minerals like gypsum it is also clear from the scatter plots that some samples show excess hco3 so4 2 and na which reveals the interaction of groundwater with silicates as well during its movement through different flow paths the silicate weathering of na rich plagioclase and active cation exchange reaction with ca2 attached to the surface of neo formed clay minerals releases na in groundwater resulting in hybrid water types wang et al 2004 han et al 2013 jeelani et al 2014 saleem et al 2015 lone et al 2020 a scatter plot of corrected bivalent cations v s na fig 6 was used to assess the effect of active cation exchange reactions in groundwater the bivariate plots of alluvium hirpur pampur and dilpur had an inclination towards y x 1 1 2 1 and 1 2 indicating a strong impact of active cation exchange reactions on chemistry of these aquifers may be due to longer residence time of groundwater fig 6 however the bivariate plots of shupiyan member had less inclination towards y 1 0 2 reflecting shorter residence time and immature sediments and or higher gradient landscapes this corroborates the above conclusions drawn from the solute chemistry that hybrid water facies results due to active cation exchange reactions on bivalent plots of na normalized ca2 versus na normalized mg2 and hco3 fig 7 the groundwater samples of upper jhelum basin fall between the carbonate and silicate ionic composition suggesting the dissolution of carbonates and weathering of silicates around the basin dominantly control the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater however some samples from nw have high cl concentration reveals an anthropogenic source thus it is clear from the above discussion that the rock types and hydrogeological characteristics such as flow paths dominantly control the ionic composition of groundwater 6 2 geochemical modelling there are several prerequisites for inverse geochemical modeling of evolving chemistry in hydrologic systems sracek et al 2004 there are two principal approaches to geochemical modeling chemical equilibrium and chemical kinetics the equilibrium approach is the most common and assumes very fast instantaneous reactions compared to groundwater residence time sracek et al 2004 based on chemical equilibrium modelling the calculated saturation index si values indicate that the groundwater across upper jhelum basin is undersaturated si 0 with respect to calcite caco3 dolomite mgca co3 2 pyrolusite mno2 manganite mno oh rhodochrosite mnco3 arsenolite as4o6 and arsenic pentoxide as2o5 mineral phases the results suggested that these mineral are present in dissolved state and are thermodynamically unstable however most of the groundwater samples are supersaturated si 0 with respect to hematite fe2o3 and magnetite fe3o4 indicating that these mineral phases precipitate as fe iii and these are thermodynamically stable the eh ph plot fig 8 a and b where most of the samples fall in arsenous acid as oh 3 field and few plot at the boundary between arsenous acid as oh 3 and hydrogen arsenate haso4 2 suggesting arsenite as iii as dominant phase than arsenate as v in the groundwater the concentration of most of the samples in ferrous ion fe2 field and a few samples near hematite fe2o3 stability zone indicates that under reducing conditions the groundwater samples are mainly in equilibrium with fe ii phase 6 3 processes favoring arsenic release the groundwater as concentration in upper jhelum basin is undocumented and unexplored groundwater as showed a significantly positive correlation with fe and mn fig 3 suggesting as mobility across upper jhelum basin is governed by redox sensitive parameters and plays a dominant role in as release the correlation between as and orp suggests redox condition is an important factor controlling as mobilization the poor correlation of no3 and so4 2 cl ratio also corroborates with redox dependent mobilization of as a significant positive correlation of as enriched groundwater and nh4 n r2 0 61 suggests that the microbial degradation of dissolved organic carbon also plays an important role in as release in oxic environment as forms a thin layer on fe minerals thus liberating little as in groundwater which is substantiated by the least correlation of as with no3 fig 3b in so4 2 reduction stage the continuous dissolution of fe causes a significant increase in fe and as minerals in groundwater which is corroborated by significantly positive correlation of as with fe fig 3d however the lower concentration of so4 2 and no3 concentration in groundwater reveals that denitrification and sulfate decline occurs in aquifers with increase in as which is substantiated by inverse correlation of as with so4 2 because as in so4 2 minerals are easily extractable and weakly sorbed guo et al 2014 jia et al 2014 the release of high hco3 concentration from sediment surfaces is an important process liable for as mobilization in groundwater which strives for adhesion on the surface of fe mineral phases biswas et al 2014 duan et al 2015 the hco3 readily competes for adsorption sites on the hematite at higher concentration although low concentrations of hco3 enhance as adsorption lone et al 2020 some previous studies have indicated that the replacement of as by hco3 from the sediment surfaces is an important mechanism of as mobilization bhattacharya et al 2002 mukherjee et al 2009 however the results obtained illustrated that few samples have less as and higher hco3 concentration revealing that high hco3 has a lesser impact on as adsorption the ph exhibited a significantly positive correlation with as fig 3c suggesting that high ph values favors the mobilization of as in groundwater in high ph conditions the surface of sediments containing as and fe minerals becomes negatively charged and causes electrostatic repulsion which declines as adsorption on fe mineral phases and leads to as release guo et al 2014 lone et al 2020 kumar and singh 2020 the presence of sulphide minerals such as arsenian pyrite and arsenopyrite associated with volcanic sedimentary and metamorphic rocks of upper jhelum basin are very common and well known primary geogenic as containing minerals the geochemical analysis of different rock types and unconsolidated sediments also revealed the presence of as across upper jhelum basin arsenic concentration in unconsolidated sediments of upper jhelum basin ranges from 04 mg kg 1 to 22 mg kg 1 bhat et al 2019 a significant proportion of iron and manganese mineral in sediments come from the parent rock but various minerals are formed during and after the deposition and compaction of unconsolidated material these oxides and hydroxides co precipitates and consequently imbibe various trace elements including as during the disintegration and decomposition of other iron and manganese minerals therefore it is clear from the above discussion that the redox sensitive parameters are dominantly controlling the as liberation and mobilization in groundwater of upper jhelum basin besides some biogeochemical processes also support as mobilization and release 6 4 isotope geochemistry stable water isotopic values of groundwater have been broadly used to identify and estimate the sources of water recharging groundwater system clark and fritz 1997 jeelani et al 2017 lone et al 2019 the stable water isotopic composition of groundwater can be significantly modified from that of local precipitation due to the stable water isotopic enrichment in water during evaporation the groundwater that have undergone evaporation exhibits systematic enrichment in stable water isotopic values resulting in divergence from the lmwl along evaporation lines that have lower slopes it was observed that the slope 5 4 of regression equation of shallow groundwater samples is lower than slope 7 9 of lmwl jeelani et al 2017 and gmwl fig 9 this suggests that the water recharging the shallow wells have undergone evaporation however the deep groundwater samples have slope 7 9 similar to lmwl and gmwl suggesting no evaporation effect some shallow groundwater samples collected from kupwara sopore meergund zainpora and marbel villages of northwestern and southeastern part of basin have higher stable water isotopic values mean δ18o 2 1 suggesting an intense evaporation effect the groundwater which undergoes evaporation shows positive correlation between δ18o and ec it was observed from the plot of δ18o v s ec fig 10 a that the water samples collected from shallow groundwater samples shows significantly positive correlation r2 0 71 indicates that evaporated surface water is recharging the shallow aquifers or direct evaporation of shallow groundwater takes place during summer season most parts of the upper jhelum basin remains waterlogged due to dominance of agricultural fields the percolation of irrigation return flow waters enriched in stable water isotopes and major ions leads to increase in the electrical conductivity of shallow aquifers further due to low gradient of the basin the areas around rivers streams are water logged and the depth to water table is 1m therefore the shallow aquifers are more vulnerable to evaporation further the increase in temperature of shallow groundwater may increase the rock water interaction and therefore facilitate the release of as and other trace elements to groundwater to further understand the processes responsible for as concentration in shallow aquifers of upper jhelum basin we plotted the δ18o with cl and as fig 10 b c the significant positive correlation of as with δ18o and cl in shallow groundwater fig 10 indicates the shallow groundwater is recharged by evaporated agrochemical and fertilizer rich waters which contain higher concentration as and cl the groundwater samples collected from northwestern and southeastern parts of the basin have lower but similar stable water isotopic values as that of the river jhelum reflecting the influent nature of the river at these locations these locations are therefore the perennial recharge areas of the unconfined aquifer s it was observed that these sites contain lesser concentration of as which is attributed to dilution of groundwater and increase in oxic conditions not favoring as release the discharge in the stream water bodies across upper jhelum basin is dominantly controlled by the glacier and snowmelt throughout the year the temperature of these melt waters is very less which does not facilities the temperature dependent reaction for the release of major ion and trace elements which could be one of the reasons for less as concentration in these groundwater aquifers the poor correlation of as with ec and cl in deep groundwater fig 10c indicates negligible anthropogenic concentration 6 5 conceptual model depicting sources of arsenic the collision of indian plate with the eurasian plate in early cenozoic led to formation of neotethys and closure of paleotethys mukherjee et al 2014 2019 the palaeo tethys ocean consisting dozens of tectonically active fragments with both constructive and destructive plate boundaries mukherjee et al 2014 2019 at destructive plate margins structural disturbance of the leaping foredeep normally occurs due to enduring movement of distortion away from the axis of the orogen within the evolving schuppen structure intermontane basins may be formed the pir panjal and zanskar thrust bounds the intermontane basin kashmir valley in nw se directions respectively fig 11 a along the greater himalaya and pir panjal ranges the intermontane basin kashmir valley forms two major axes of orogenic upheaval fig 11a its geographical location and the structural disposition is the outcome of the great himalayan formation the kashmir himalayas consists of paleozoic and mesozoic sediments of oceanic origin rich in as and other trace elements overlies the precambrian rock belonging to the continental crust of indian plate it has been postulated that the as mobilization from the sediments deposited on under thrusting plate to the metamorphic hydrothermal fluids are most effective in continental provinces raychowdhury et al 2014 mukherjee et al 2019 the eroded material brought down by gravitational forces and fluvial channels from the himalayan mountains are accumulated and deposited within the intermontane basin fig 11b these sediment deposits are the result of physico chemical disintegration and decomposition of mafic and ultramafic rocks rich in as concentration during its transport through different flowpaths as from aquifer matrix is released under oxic as well as anoxic conditions thus contaminating the groundwater in shallow wells and recharge areas o2 enriched water becomes more suitable for as v release while as in deep aquifers the reducing conditions favors as iii release mukherjee et al 2019 lone et al 2020 hence it can be suggested that the tectonic framework and lithological settings of greater himalaya and pir panjal mountains rich in as surrounding the upper jhelum basin provides the major source of as enrichment in the quaternary sediment deposits karewas and alluvium which is released in groundwater under favorable conditions basin scale to local scale groundwater flow systems originating in the himalayan foothills transport the dissolved as under reduced redox conditions in organic carbon enriched young alluvial aquifers of the upper jhelum basin and downstream the study suggested that the groundwater in upper jhelum basin is unsafe for drinking the consequence of as enriched groundwater on the health of people in upper jhelum basin is quite noticeable 7000 cancer patients are admitted every year in which 28 of patients are reported to having stomach neurological cardiovascular and respiratory disorders qurieshi et al 2016 which could be due to exposure of people to as enriched groundwater thus the carcinogenic effect of as and other trace elements on health of people in upper jhelum basin needs to be investigated properly 7 conclusion the groundwater as in unconsolidated aquifers of upper jhelum basin ranges from 0 14 µg l 1 to 192 µg l 1 out of this 45 of samples show as level above who guideline for drinking water 10 µg l 1 the study suggested that the groundwater as enrichment is higher 68 in shallow wells 3m the significant correlation of as with ph fe mn and hco3 suggested that the as mobility is governed by redox sensitive parameters and arsenite as the dominant phase under reducing conditions the study also suggests that microbial degradation of dissolved organic carbon doc is an important biogeochemical process favoring as release in groundwater the sites recharged by river jhelum with lower isotopic values have lower as concentration reflecting the dilution effect and the increase in oxic conditions which do not favor as release the study revealed that the tectonic framework and lithological settings of greater himalaya and pir panjal mountains surrounding the upper jhelum basin provides the major source of as enrichment in the quaternary sediment deposits karewas and alluvium which is released in groundwater under favorable conditions basin scale to local scale groundwater flow system originating in upper jhelum basin transports the dissolved as under reduced conditions to downstream thus contaminating the aquifers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
5068,floods have an increasing impact on cities encompassing the management of the water cycle by integrating multiple disciplines of engineering social economic and environmental sciences this study focuses on deploying site specific spatial strategies considering human interactions towards assessing urban flooding initially two surface runoff models were implemented at a high spatial resolution to estimate the water availability and infiltration capacity of the mumbai city india to this end first the major watersheds were delineated corresponding to four major rivers and the coupling of hydrological and hydraulic models to obtain the spatial flood extent subsequently non heuristic criteria were evaluated to determine flood hazard maps then spatial risk maps were identified corresponding to social economic environmental and infrastructural impacts to deploy site specific strategies for flood mitigation in addition a correlation analysis was performed for the sub catchment to understand the dependency within the risks management interventions to reduce these risks at especially vulnerable sites were identified including stormwater harvesting flood risk management and water reuse during dry seasons therefore this study bridges the gap between modelers and decision planners in order to embrace flooding as an opportunity instead of a disaster keywords urban flooding hazard and risk mapping infiltration capacity water harvesting decision planning 1 introduction urbanization leads to deforestation and increased impervious surfaces which in turn have large adverse impacts on the hydrology of cities in addition urban densification contributes to a decrease of ecosystem services es in urban areas and therefore has an unfavorable impact on the health wellbeing and the quality of life of people who live and work in cities devi et al 2019 adapting urban planning to future hydrological changes in a sustainable manner is a major task because of the complex and context specific processes of cities which is associated with large uncertainties unep 2014 moreover understanding urban hydrology is challenged by its inherent complexity and the dynamic interactions between river and drainage networks as a consequence the development and implementation of effective adaptation strategies to manage flood risks are hampered darabi et al 2020 flooding is one of the most expensive natural disasters faced by urban communities it has caused significant human casualties displacement of millions damaging of urban landscapes and overwhelming economic losses darabi et al 2020 haghighi et al 2020 managing urban flood risk requires a detailed understanding of the water cycle at a micro scale level urban sub catchments as well as of the interactions of hydrological processes between urban sub catchments and the adjacent river s in urban areas if any vercruysse et al 2019 hence the urban hydrology is sensitive to various natural and human induced changes taking place at multiple spatial scales haghighi et al 2020 pirnia et al 2019a b to accurately assess current and future surface water flow and delineate flood extent and depth within urban sub catchments an integrated approach which considers the complex context of urban river catchments and their socio economic relevance is needed pappenberger et al 2005 simonovic and carson 2003 yi et

the flood risks map for amol city iran by obtaining the flood hazard and vulnerability map considering various criteria using data driven geospatial techniques in particular the use of multi criteria decision analysis mcda techniques to integrate technical environmental and socio economic aspects has shown to be useful in identifying solutions towards mitigating urban flooding ghanbarpour and hipel 2011 hwang and lin 2012 this paper presents the results of a comprehensive socio economic analysis using spatial hydrological hydraulic modelling to produce a practical decision making framework for mitigating flood risk in urban sub catchments referred to as watersheds of mumbai city this framework facilitates the understanding of hydrological processes at a local scale and enables assessing current and future socio economic impacts caused by different stormwater management interventions the study focuses on the approach based upon an appropriate understanding of the whole system behavior including social economic environmental and infrastructural objectives by adopting a non heuristic approach in addition this approach provides an opportunity to deal with the challenges by capturing the impacts of flood risk and to deploy strategies to mitigate them by directing and treating this threat as a sustainable resource consequently the objective of this study is threefold 1 simulating water flow and computing flood hydrographs at urban sub catchment level using spatial hydrological models 2 producing high resolution spatial flood hazard and risk maps by considering social environmental economic and infrastructure criteria and 3 developing site specific strategies to mitigate urban flooding under extreme scenarios 2 study area due to the rapid growth in economy and infrastructure experienced in india since the 1980s navi mumbai has always been a spot for trade and investment the study area covers an approximate area of 860 sq km falling in the survey of india soi topographic map numbers 47 a 15 16 47 b 13 and 47 e 4 the area receives an average annual rainfall between 2500 mm and 3000 mm and is vulnerable to flooding because of its topographic location during monsoon it faces quick runoff from hilly slopes on the eastern side high river discharge from the northern side and tidal variations from the creek on the western side besides mumbai is also experiencing rapid urban sprawl and increased population density the drainage capacity of the city is insufficient to deal with its population and water loads ffc 2006 the four major rivers passing within the city are mithi poisar dahisar and oshiwara fig 1 all of which originate from hilly regions and flow towards the west to join the arabian sea through creeks as the capital of maharashtra and the financial capital of india mumbai has grown tremendously in the last few decades due to concentrated industries transport trading administration and economy gupta 2007 samant and subramanyan 1998 shaw 1999 zope et al 2015 in fact mumbai is currently facing unprecedented challenges driven by urban migration kulkarni et al 2014a explosive urban growth has dramatically changed the natural hydrological cycle of the city resulting in a steep increase of runoff over the past decade ali et al 2011 dewan and yamaguchi 2009 miller et al 2002 sayal et al 2014 on july 26 2005 mumbai experienced the coincidence of a high intensity rainfall event of about 190 mm h with high tides flooding the entire sub urban part of the city and resulting in a tremendous human economic and infrastructure losses ffc 2006 gupta 2007 gupta and lokanadham 2008 kulkarni et al 2014b zope et al 2015 mumbai is now one of the cities with the highest accumulated flood risk in the world in terms of number of people and assets exposed to local stormwater and tidal flooding moreover it lacks the tools models and data required to provide information to manage flood risk effectively furthermore its drainage capacity cannot be expanded due to the limited land use availability in coastal regions zope et al 2016 henceforth flood mapping is essential for coastal cities like mumbai to facilitate water resources planning by experts and therefore detect the vulnerability of infrastructures and civilians towards flood events fernández and lutz 2010 3 methodology initially the surface runoff models were implemented to estimate the direct runoff depth for the city the hydrological and hydraulic models were combined to obtain flood extent maps for four urban sub catchments referred to as watersheds in mumbai city subsequently a multi criteria decision making approach was applied to obtain flood hazard and risk maps to deploy strategic plans the parameters required to run models and the criteria considered to obtain the flood hazard maps are represented in fig 2 both the datasets acquired and the models implemented to carry out the study are described below 3 1 datasets a series of datasets including precipitation temperature land use soil map and digital elevation model dem were collected to perform these analyses the daily time series of precipitation and temperature were acquired for the mumbai city and its watersheds fig 1 lulc classification was categorized into five classes water forest agricultural urban and wasteland the datasets acquired from various institutes and their description are tabulated in table 1 3 2 hydrological hydraulic modeling initially the national resources conservation services curve number nrcs cn and the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs invest models were implemented to estimate the spatial surface runoff depth and infiltration capacity of the city surface runoff modelling was used to understand the topographic characteristics of the region to further identify and select which locations were suitable to store and harvest stormwater the hydrological engineering center hydrologic modeling system hec hms was integrated with the 1d hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras to identify flood extent and depth for the study region to this end the four watersheds corresponding to the four major rivers in mumbai city were delineated subsequently a multi criteria approach was adopted to obtain flood hazard maps at a high spatial resolution risk maps were developed to assess the spatial distribution of the social economic environmental and infrastructural impacts of flooding on people several risks were analyzed individually to deploy strategic plans for specific sites furthermore the pearson correlation coefficient between the risks in the urban sub catchments was determined to understand their interrelationships and whether a single intervention could serve to address different risks at the same time or not 3 2 1 rainfall runoff modeling with nrcs cn method surface runoff depth was estimated with the nrcs cn method a very simple and data extensive approach developed by the usda natural resources conservation services mishra et al 2005 it requires lulc soil dem and rainfall as an input to estimate direct runoff fig b 1 the model used the annual mean precipitation for 2018 by considering the average of past 25 years of rainfall data to estimate the annual mean runoff depth and the infiltration capacity of the watersheds direct runoff depth depends upon a series of parameters such as precipitation initial abstraction and infiltration rate as described in eq 1 the complete method to estimate runoff is described in appendix a 1 p i a f q where p represents precipitation mm i a is the initial abstraction mm f is cumulative infiltration mm and q represents direct runoff mm 3 2 2 water yield estimation through the invest model the invest model monitors flow regime alterations due to changes in the ecosystem services for the study region tallis et al 2010 the model represents an empirical function based on the budyko theory budyko 1974 capturing the heterogeneity in the water yield corresponding to precipitation lulc slope soil types etc the model considered the annual mean precipitation data of 25 years of rainfall data to estimate the annual water yield as described in eq 2 more details about this model are briefly explained in appendix a 2 y x 1 aet x p x p x where y x represents the spatial water yield at each pixel x p x is the gridded precipitation and aet x is the annual evapotranspiration per pixel 3 2 3 hydrological modeling using hec hms the hec hms model simulates different processes such as base flow infiltration runoff and river routing ali et al 2011 saghafian et al 2008 usace 2000 using three main models meteorological model basin model and control specification the delineation of watersheds into sub basins and the calculation of their area stream length elevation and longest flow path were performed using hec geohms usace 2003 subsequently the model was exported to hec hms for further analysis the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method the scs unit hydrograph and the muskingum method were used for infiltration transformation and routing respectively a statistical analysis was carried out by applying the gumbel distribution to the rainfall dataset for the past 68 years 1950 2018 obtaining rainfall depths for various return periods then a 24 h storm rainfall depth under 2 10 25 50 and 100 year return periods was introduced as an input in hec hms to determine the flood hydrograph and peak discharge at each junction and the outlet nodes peak discharge for the watersheds was computed and verified from published data for oshiwara zope et al 2016 dahisar eldho et al 2018 mithi zope et al 2015 and poisar kulkarni et al 2014a these values and the land use classes of the watersheds were used as inputs in the 1 d hec ras hydraulic model for performing the hydrological channel routing at subsequent downstream nodes 3 2 4 hydraulic modeling using 1 d model hec ras hec ras is a hydrodynamic model to perform one dimensional hydraulic calculations of water surface profiles in channel networks using the saint venant equations when flow conditions are approximately unidirectional input parameters required by hec ras include spatial geometric and flow data which can be imported from the outputs generated by hec hms and boundary conditions lastra et al 2008 other parameters used in hec ras are stream centerline banks flow path centerlines cross section cut lines and the attributes extracted by running hec georas which is an arc gis toolbar the entire watershed was divided into upper middle and lower reaches in hec georas such that its geometry consisted of left bank right bank and flow paths the intersections in the reaches were set at an equal interval subsequently they were extracted using the triangulated irregular network tin obtained from the dem of the watersheds usace 2011 manning s roughness coefficient n maps were prepared for the four watersheds by assigning individual manning s n to each land use class in the study area manning s n were set at 0 015 0 10 0 03 and 0 15 for built up land vegetation water body and forest as well as barren land respectively kalyanapu et al 2010 vieux 2001 zope et al 2015 moreover the geometry data was exported to hec ras for the hydraulic analysis water surface profiles were generated at different points of interest using the saint venant equations root and papakos 2010 usace 2010 tidal depth variations were set as boundary conditions in the watersheds attached to the coastal lines then the models for the watersheds were simulated using subcritical supercritical and mixed flow conditions depending upon their boundary conditions usace 2010 the peak discharge data at each junction derived from hec hms served as an input in hec ras where the hydraulic simulations were performed for 2 10 25 50 and 100 year return periods the water surface profiles and water surface extent obtained in hec ras were exported to arc gis and analyzed using the hec georas toolbar finally the flood extents and depths for different flow and land use conditions were generated by using the hec georas model for different flow and land use conditions alaghmand et al 2010 suriya and mudgal 2012 3 3 flood mapping flood maps with different flow conditions were developed for each watershed to estimate flow extent and depth in turn the maps representing flood extent and depth were used as an input for developing flood hazard and risk maps 3 3 1 flood extent and depth the results obtained from hec ras were exported to arc gis including the centerline and cross section alignments with surface elevations at the cross sections and a boundary polygon defining the maximum flood extent then hec georas was applied to conduct the post processing of the imported files by creating the water surface tin from the cross section alignment as well as by building polygon and water surface elevations hernandez and zhang 2007 besides the water surface tin was compared with the terrain tin to create the floodplain polygon this polygon represented the maximum possible flood extent according to the cross section limit maidment and djokic 2000 zope et al 2015 whilst the flood depth grids stood for the flood hazard for the study area 3 3 2 flood hazard flood hazard is defined to as a harm or danger that can be caused by an event flooding to the society environment infrastructure etc whereas flood risk is referred to as the chance that a flood hazard will actually cause some harm ogato et al 2020 flood hazard mapping is important to develop and operationalize an effective flood early warning system as well as to establish a flood insurance and risk assessment program the determination of flood hazard fig 2 was based on several criteria including slope elevation aspect land use proximity to river centerline distance from coastal bank peak discharge and maximum flood extent toosi et al 2019 zope et al 2015 zope et al 2016 thus thematic layers related to these criteria were developed to prepare a spatial hazard map for the watersheds the distances to the respective sites from the river were computed using the cost distance tool in arc gis whilst the euclidean distance tool was applied between individual sites and the coast the thematic map of runoff with peak discharge at each sub basin is provided as one of the parameters in computing hazard map the spatial representation of sub basins for all four watersheds is delineated through hec hms and is represented in fig b 3 the complete methodology to integrate peak discharge runoff to obtain flood hazard maps is described by zope et al 2015 and tingsanchali and karim 2005 similarly the flood extents generated for selected return period storm events were merged to obtain the maximum flood extent polygon which was further integrated to obtain the flood hazard map the complete methodology to integrate flood extent to obtain flood hazard maps is described by zope et al 2016 and tingsanchali and karim 2005 subsequently each criterion was ranked and their weights were obtained pramojanee et al 1997 based on their significance to cause flooding suriya and mudgal 2012 using the delphi technique lee et al 2013 the hazard map was divided into five classes i e no very low low moderate high and extreme each criterion is divided into a number of sub criteria with further effect values ev also weighing values wv are assigned to each criterion based on the significance that factor may have on flooding table 2 the spatial maps were integrated using the raster calculator toolbar in arc gis yielding a hazard map for each watershed in mumbai city the hazard map prepared was developed for the maximum flood extent i e a 100 year return period storm 3 3 3 risk assessment the risk assessment was conducted using different thematic maps and spatial information gathered from a series of municipal corporations census department insurance firms government database health departments environmental information system envis district census handbook etc spatial maps were prepared to represent the distribution of infrastructure services population hospitals schools public administration firms residential commercial and industrial properties within the sub catchments these spatial maps were further integrated with the hazard maps to assess the spatial distribution of the risks associated with four impact categories namely society economy environment and infrastructure these four impact categories were used to assess spatial risk at a micro scale level within the four watersheds of mumbai according to five classes namely no very low low medium high and extreme the social category considers the responses to a disruptive flood event such as loss of confidence change in expectations and indirect consequences of deepening inequality afifi et al 2019 bodoque et al 2016 meyer et al 2009 these impacts were analyzed and evaluated by integrating population density with the flood affected region and the availability of local infrastructure services such as education centers small firms hospitals public administrations etc the impact on rural and sub urban areas were considered to be greater than that on regions with urban or high rise buildings this effect is deemed to be independent from the size of hospitals or schools the economic category involves the financial losses that cities have to face due to flooding aroca jiménez et al 2018 ghanbarpour et al 2013 zeng et al 2019 in this study direct loss was computed based on the cost related to repairing or replacing assets for the residential commercial or industrial sectors initially the total value of assets at risk and their spatial distribution were estimated based on data from official statistics and assigned to the corresponding land use categories the total insured monetary values associated with residential commercial and industrial properties were obtained from proprietary insurance data from the rms india earthquake model the insurance penetration for mumbai city is assumed to be around 8 for residential 14 for commercial and 17 for industrial properties ranger et al 2011 since these estimates have high uncertainties and depend upon the level and quantity of damage approximate figures were considered in the analysis the residential class was addressed by obtaining the approximate value per square meter of private household inventories different for urban and rural areas ranger et al 2011 by considering the standard of living for the respective communities similarly approximate values were established for the industries by implementing asset management techniques campbell et al 2016 damage evaluation was computed spatially for each sub basin by taking into account the combination of flood depth with different damage values meyer et al 2009 the environmental category considers water quality deterioration and the associated impacts on the surroundings of the region ghanbarpour et al 2013 meyer et al 2009 the effect of flooding on the environment was evaluated in terms of flood level velocity criterion and stream power other aspects such as erosion pollution due to contamination the impacts on biodiversity and the inhabitants in the forest were also taken into account to compute the environmental risk a relative analysis was performed within the sub basins of each watershed to produce a spatial representation of these environmental impacts finally the infrastructural category corresponds to disruptions of public and private infrastructure services and their associated impacts on people who depend on them berndtsson et al 2019 darabi et al 2019 this includes the assistance of public services communication services in terms of transport such as roads trains etc electricity telecommunication networks etc these data were analyzed and processed spatially such that the services affected by flooding depth were combined in an infrastructure impact map once all the categories were addressed individually a spatial map representing the spatial distribution of total risk for each watershed was built by implementing the following set of weights 0 25 social 0 2 environmental 0 3 economic and 0 25 infrastructure 4 results and discussion the surface runoff models were implemented to estimate the direct runoff depth for the city and its watersheds subsequently the hydrological hydraulic models were used to obtain the flood extent map finally a multi criteria decision making approach was applied to obtain flood hazard and risk maps and therefore enable developing strategic plans the results associated with these tasks are explained below 4 1 runoff and infiltration nrcs cn invest model the spatial runoff and water yield maps derived from the nrcs cn and invest models for the four watersheds are represented in fig 3 dahisar mithi oshiwara and poisar were found to have 35 2 6 9 13 9 and 36 1 of their areas achieving surface flows of up to 1 460 mm when considering a threshold of 2120 mm these values were 11 3 48 6 42 2 and 24 1 in the case of mithi and oshiwara approximately half of the area was experiencing relatively high surface runoff the spatial maps of the natural water infiltration capacity for the four watersheds are presented in fig 4 dahisar mithi oshiwara and poisar included zones with an infiltration capacity of up to 110 mm that amounted to 11 5 11 3 14 3 and 13 2 of their areas respectively these values increased to 24 2 13 9 32 3 and 32 4 for an infiltration capacity of 690 mm hence a relatively high percentage of the areas of oshiwara and poisar had a high infiltration capacity the spatial surface runoff and water yield maps for the mumbai city are represented in fig b 2 a and b whilst its infiltration capacity is shown in fig b 2 c and d both nrcs cn and invest represent a similar range and spatial distribution of surface flow for the entire city 4 2 peak discharge hydraulic modelling an investigation was carried out using hec geohms and hec hms see fig b 3 for computing peak discharge table 3 presents the values of peak discharge m3 s obtained for selected return periods at the four watersheds since mithi consisted of two lakes namely vihar and powai two peak discharges were computed by including and excluding overflows from the lakes into the catchment hec georas enabled an additional division of watersheds into main streams upstream midstream and downstream and branch streams upstream tributary midstream tributary or downstream tributary as shown in fig b 3 for a 100 year return period dahisar and mithi including overflow from lakes exhibited approximately the same values of peak discharge table 3 however they differed in terms of infiltration capacity thereby demanding different strategies to manage flood risk furthermore flood depth and extent maps for the oshiwara mithi poisar and dahisar watersheds under selected return periods are represented in fig 5 4 3 flood hazard and risk mapping in the case of the 100 year return period peak discharge the flood hazard map is shown in fig 6 a significant fraction of the total area of all the watersheds were in the moderate and high classes of the hazard map table 4 the combination of areas at high and extreme hazard had a relative size of 34 2 38 3 38 9 and 42 3 for dahisar mithi oshiwara and poisar respectively furthermore the percentage area covered by different impact categories in the watersheds are tabulated in table 4 to analyze the zones under greater risk within a watershed the area under high risk and extreme risk category were merged together dahisar mithi oshiwar and poisar watersheds have areas of 10 1 26 8 13 0 and 22 2 under social risk fig 7 10 1 15 4 24 2 and 42 0 under economic loss more than 110 million usd 31 8 27 1 14 6 and 45 5 under environmental risk 27 1 24 2 42 9 and 35 9 under infrastructural impact and 35 2 24 5 43 3 and 63 4 under overall risk fig 8 in conclusion mithi followed by poisar gave the highest values for social risk and poisar followed by oshiwara gave the highest values for economic loss similarly for environmental loss the highest values gave poisar followed by dahisar and for infrastructural loss oshiwara followed by poisar gave the highest value the highest values for the overall risk taking the sum of the values of the individual risks gave poisar followed by oshiwara these watersheds are facing an overall high risk due to the presence of highly urbanized areas and densely populated suburbs it follows from the above that each watershed has a different risk profile hence a customized strategy for each watershed targeting the zones which are prone to a specific risk or a combination of specific risks will be required these figures also explain why the city is experiencing regular flooding with significant impacts almost every year in the next section the correlations between the various risks within the urban sub catchments were determined below 4 4 correlation analysis between risks a pearson correlation analysis was undertaken to determine the relationships between the risks of the watersheds a positive and significant p values 0 05 correlation indicates that a single intervention could address different risks at the same time however in the present study no specific correlation was observed see table 5 all the watersheds have different correlations and significance between paired risks for example the correlation between the economic loss and social impact was 0 52 0 27 0 31 and 0 49 for oshiwara mithi dahisar and poisar respectively 4 5 strategic planning and mitigating flood risk present strategies require amendments in order to develop a more resilient model and to effectively deal with future uncertainties since they are often based on short term solutions in recent years the concept of flood risk management has evolved and has expanded to include nature based solutions which can contribute to enhancing flood resilience and taking into account the ecosystem services they provide bertilsson et al 2019 sayers et al 2015 in addition as nature based solutions are without exception more flexible than traditional structural solutions nature based or hybrid solutions often provide more sustainable long term solutions because they are more easily adaptable to uncertain climatic change projections and projections of other changing drivers to implement traditional structural solutions governments need to secure large investments for projects which usually have long lead times 10 years and even more nature based or hybrid solutions to upgrade or replace existing flood risk management infrastructure generally do not require large investments upfront and project lead times are shorter without adequate resources and regular maintenance infrastructure can rapidly deteriorate and will no longer comply with the design standard the indian government has developed policies to prevents the construction of infrastructure near flood prone areas and encourages the installation of rainwater harvesting techniques to reduce surface runoff thus mitigating the pressure on the drainage system of the city this study reveals that there are opportunities to reduce the flood risks in the four watersheds by further enhancing their capacity using nature based or hybrid solutions to store and reuse water based on detailed spatial analyses according to the central ground water authority cgwa only 20 of the rainwater in mumbai percolates into the ground and 80 runoff ends in the sea the integration of flood hazard and risk maps with high infiltration zones within the watersheds would identify potentially suitable sites to store or infiltrate stormwater harvesting structures can be built at these locations see fig 9 for this purpose such as retaining walls water tanks etc contributing to groundwater recharge too furthermore low impact development lid techniques such as bioretention cells swales or rain gardens can be implemented at these locations in order to reuse part of the volume of groundwater recharged during dry seasons alexander et al 2019 also the poisar watershed experienced all types of risks the blue zones see fig 9 along the poisar river should be utilized to construct percolation tanks or swales to mitigate these risks as well as to build retaining walls to reduce the infrastructural and environmental impacts of flooding retaining walls along the mithi river should also be built to reduce social impacts since this watershed was found to face low levels of risks of the other categories social risk can be mitigated by educating civilians and residents in disaster management and mitigation policies this will require to launch an awareness program focused on flood preparedness to address the responsibilities of the civilians and the need for developing emergency plans as well as to establish shelters at public parks gatherings library markets etc especially in areas of the mithi and poisar watersheds a governance framework to foster stakeholder s participation including planners government and residents should be developed and implemented pathak et al 2019b similarly retaining walls should be implemented along the oshiwara river due to its high risk of economic loss and infrastructural impact economic risks are related in this study to the direct losses and flood insurance is potentially an effective measure to mitigate these risks however it will require the government to create incentives to promote the financial sector to provide long term flood protection insurance in the case of poisar and oshiwara flood insurance could be potentially effective to support the renovation of the houses of low income residents infrastructure loss comprises damage to public and private infrastructure affecting the services they provide to the residents the results reveal that there is a need to increase the resilience of local transports communication and other services in the watersheds this is especially applicable to the oshiwara and poisar watersheds because of their relatively high infrastructure vulnerability finally since dahisar experienced high environmental impacts check dams might be built to attenuate these effects along the zones where such impacts range from high to extreme environmental losses are predominantly caused by the high flow velocity of flood water river discharges the implementation of retaining walls and the widening of channels specifically at the poisar and dahisar rivers should be considered to prevent flow from causing erosion overall the implementation of these techniques would reduce pressure on natural resources thereby providing a sustainable approach to mitigate flooding this study presents a comprehensive and integrative approach to analyze flood risks and to support the identification and prioritization of interventions to mitigate these risks at the urban sub catchment level the methodology used in this study is based on a non heuristic approach it considers the spatial distribution of various types of flood risks both individually as well as aggregated with the support of gis the spatial analysis of flood risks and the identification of interventions can be performed to assist planners and stakeholders to develop a long term flood risks mitigation strategy at the urban sub catchment level while acknowledging its interaction with its surrounding environment and taking into account uncertainties associated with long term predictions 5 conclusions the responsibility for managing and reducing flood risk has always been and will remain a challenge for different parts of society under the premise that flooding has become the new normal in mumbai city this phenomenon was evaluated in this study there is a need to assist water engineers and urban planners to spatially identify locations with elevated flood risk and customize planning strategies to mitigate such risk moreover approaches are required to fill the need for integrative and strategic long term urban flood risk management plans by considering the uncertainties associated with climate change economic fluctuations and population growth the proposed methodology provides a non heuristic approach to deal with these challenges by capturing the impacts of flood risk resulting in practical measures to mitigate them by directing and treating this threat as a sustainable resource the approach taken is based upon an appropriate understanding of the whole system behavior including social economic environmental and infrastructural objectives and how risks may change over the longer term four urban watersheds in mumbai were used as a case study area no correlation was observed between the different categories of flood risk within the watersheds hence each dimension of flood risk requires a specific set of responses leading to a customized strategy for each urban catchment these customized strategies will provide the components of an overall strategic flood risk management plan for mumbai the next step will consist of integrating the patchwork of measures and instruments identified at the urban catchment level into a broader planning perspective to sustainably manage the flood risks of the city as a whole this study provides a robust technique to assess flood risk and support strategic planning with the appropriatelevelofdetail by considering non heuristic drivers it bridges the gap between the modeling and planning aspects this technique reduces the effort cost and subjectivity however it requires more time in decision planning due to the demand for spatial considerations and site specific recommendations due to the level of spatial detail large datasets from various institutions and government organizations will be needed the latter may hamper wider applications credit authorship contribution statement shray pathak conceptualization methodology formal analysis

5068,floods have an increasing impact on cities encompassing the management of the water cycle by integrating multiple disciplines of engineering social economic and environmental sciences this study focuses on deploying site specific spatial strategies considering human interactions towards assessing urban flooding initially two surface runoff models were implemented at a high spatial resolution to estimate the water availability and infiltration capacity of the mumbai city india to this end first the major watersheds were delineated corresponding to four major rivers and the coupling of hydrological and hydraulic models to obtain the spatial flood extent subsequently non heuristic criteria were evaluated to determine flood hazard maps then spatial risk maps were identified corresponding to social economic environmental and infrastructural impacts to deploy site specific strategies for flood mitigation in addition a correlation analysis was performed for the sub catchment to understand the dependency within the risks management interventions to reduce these risks at especially vulnerable sites were identified including stormwater harvesting flood risk management and water reuse during dry seasons therefore this study bridges the gap between modelers and decision planners in order to embrace flooding as an opportunity instead of a disaster keywords urban flooding hazard and risk mapping infiltration capacity water harvesting decision planning 1 introduction urbanization leads to deforestation and increased impervious surfaces which in turn have large adverse impacts on the hydrology of cities in addition urban densification contributes to a decrease of ecosystem services es in urban areas and therefore has an unfavorable impact on the health wellbeing and the quality of life of people who live and work in cities devi et al 2019 adapting urban planning to future hydrological changes in a sustainable manner is a major task because of the complex and context specific processes of cities which is associated with large uncertainties unep 2014 moreover understanding urban hydrology is challenged by its inherent complexity and the dynamic interactions between river and drainage networks as a consequence the development and implementation of effective adaptation strategies to manage flood risks are hampered darabi et al 2020 flooding is one of the most expensive natural disasters faced by urban communities it has caused significant human casualties displacement of millions damaging of urban landscapes and overwhelming economic losses darabi et al 2020 haghighi et al 2020 managing urban flood risk requires a detailed understanding of the water cycle at a micro scale level urban sub catchments as well as of the interactions of

the flood risks map for amol city iran by obtaining the flood hazard and vulnerability map considering various criteria using data driven geospatial techniques in particular the use of multi criteria decision analysis mcda techniques to integrate technical environmental and socio economic aspects has shown to be useful in identifying solutions towards mitigating urban flooding ghanbarpour and hipel 2011 hwang and lin 2012 this paper presents the results of a comprehensive socio economic analysis using spatial hydrological hydraulic modelling to produce a practical decision making framework for mitigating flood risk in urban sub catchments referred to as watersheds of mumbai city this framework facilitates the understanding of hydrological processes at a local scale and enables assessing current and future socio economic impacts caused by different stormwater management interventions the study focuses on the approach based upon an appropriate understanding of the whole system behavior including social economic environmental and infrastructural objectives by adopting a non heuristic approach in addition this approach provides an opportunity to deal with the challenges by capturing the impacts of flood risk and to deploy strategies to mitigate them by directing and treating this threat as a sustainable resource consequently the objective of this study is threefold 1 simulating water flow and computing flood hydrographs at urban sub catchment level using spatial hydrological models 2 producing high resolution spatial flood hazard and risk maps by considering social environmental economic and infrastructure criteria and 3 developing site specific strategies to mitigate urban flooding under extreme scenarios 2 study area due to the rapid growth in economy and infrastructure experienced in india since the 1980s navi mumbai has always been a spot for trade and investment the study area covers an approximate area of 860 sq km falling in the survey of india soi topographic map numbers 47 a 15 16 47 b 13 and 47 e 4 the area receives an average annual rainfall between 2500 mm and 3000 mm and is vulnerable to flooding because of its topographic location during monsoon it faces quick runoff from hilly slopes on the eastern side high river discharge from the northern side and tidal variations from the creek on the western side besides mumbai is also experiencing rapid urban sprawl and increased population density the drainage capacity of the city is insufficient to deal with its population and water loads ffc 2006 the four major rivers passing within the city are mithi poisar dahisar and oshiwara fig 1 all of which originate from hilly regions and flow towards the west to join the arabian sea through creeks as the capital of maharashtra and the financial capital of india mumbai has grown tremendously in the last few decades due to concentrated industries transport trading administration and economy gupta 2007 samant and subramanyan 1998 shaw 1999 zope et al 2015 in fact mumbai is currently facing unprecedented challenges driven by urban migration kulkarni et al 2014a explosive urban growth has dramatically changed the natural hydrological cycle of the city resulting in a steep increase of runoff over the past decade ali et al 2011 dewan and yamaguchi 2009 miller et al 2002 sayal et al 2014 on july 26 2005 mumbai experienced the coincidence of a high intensity rainfall event of about 190 mm h with high tides flooding the entire sub urban part of the city and resulting in a tremendous human economic and infrastructure losses ffc 2006 gupta 2007 gupta and lokanadham 2008 kulkarni et al 2014b zope et al 2015 mumbai is now one of the cities with the highest accumulated flood risk in the world in terms of number of people and assets exposed to local stormwater and tidal flooding moreover it lacks the tools models and data required to provide information to manage flood risk effectively furthermore its drainage capacity cannot be expanded due to the limited land use availability in coastal regions zope et al 2016 henceforth flood mapping is essential for coastal cities like mumbai to facilitate water resources planning by experts and therefore detect the vulnerability of infrastructures and civilians towards flood events fernández and lutz 2010 3 methodology initially the surface runoff models were implemented to estimate the direct runoff depth for the city the hydrological and hydraulic models were combined to obtain flood extent maps for four urban sub catchments referred to as watersheds in mumbai city subsequently a multi criteria decision making approach was applied to obtain flood hazard and risk maps to deploy strategic plans the parameters required to run models and the criteria considered to obtain the flood hazard maps are represented in fig 2 both the datasets acquired and the models implemented to carry out the study are described below 3 1 datasets a series of datasets including precipitation temperature land use soil map and digital elevation model dem were collected to perform these analyses the daily time series of precipitation and temperature were acquired for the mumbai city and its watersheds fig 1 lulc classification was categorized into five classes water forest agricultural urban and wasteland the datasets acquired from various institutes and their description are tabulated in table 1 3 2 hydrological hydraulic modeling initially the national resources conservation services curve number nrcs cn and the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs invest models were implemented to estimate the spatial surface runoff depth and infiltration capacity of the city surface runoff modelling was used to understand the topographic characteristics of the region to further identify and select which locations were suitable to store and harvest stormwater the hydrological engineering center hydrologic modeling system hec hms was integrated with the 1d hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras to identify flood extent and depth for the study region to this end the four watersheds corresponding to the four major rivers in mumbai city were delineated subsequently a multi criteria approach was adopted to obtain flood hazard maps at a high spatial resolution risk maps were developed to assess the spatial distribution of the social economic environmental and infrastructural impacts of flooding on people several risks were analyzed individually to deploy strategic plans for specific sites furthermore the pearson correlation coefficient between the risks in the urban sub catchments was determined to understand their interrelationships and whether a single intervention could serve to address different risks at the same time or not 3 2 1 rainfall runoff modeling with nrcs cn method surface runoff depth was estimated with the nrcs cn method a very simple and data extensive approach developed by the usda natural resources conservation services mishra et al 2005 it requires lulc soil dem and rainfall as an input to estimate direct runoff fig b 1 the model used the annual mean precipitation for 2018 by considering the average of past 25 years of rainfall data to estimate the annual mean runoff depth and the infiltration capacity of the watersheds direct runoff depth depends upon a series of parameters such as precipitation initial abstraction and infiltration rate as described in eq 1 the complete method to estimate runoff is described in appendix a 1 p i a f q where p represents precipitation mm i a is the initial abstraction mm f is cumulative infiltration mm and q represents direct runoff mm 3 2 2 water yield estimation through the invest model the invest model monitors flow regime alterations due to changes in the ecosystem services for the study region tallis et al 2010 the model represents an empirical function based on the budyko theory budyko 1974 capturing the heterogeneity in the water yield corresponding to precipitation lulc slope soil types etc the model considered the annual mean precipitation data of 25 years of rainfall data to estimate the annual water yield as described in eq 2 more details about this model are briefly explained in appendix a 2 y x 1 aet x p x p x where y x represents the spatial water yield at each pixel x p x is the gridded precipitation and aet x is the annual evapotranspiration per pixel 3 2 3 hydrological modeling using hec hms the hec hms model simulates different processes such as base flow infiltration runoff and river routing ali et al 2011 saghafian et al 2008 usace 2000 using three main models meteorological model basin model and control specification the delineation of watersheds into sub basins and the calculation of their area stream length elevation and longest flow path were performed using hec geohms usace 2003 subsequently the model was exported to hec hms for further analysis the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method the scs unit hydrograph and the muskingum method were used for infiltration transformation and routing respectively a statistical analysis was carried out by applying the gumbel distribution to the rainfall dataset for the past 68 years 1950 2018 obtaining rainfall depths for various return periods then a 24 h storm rainfall depth under 2 10 25 50 and 100 year return periods was introduced as an input in hec hms to determine the flood hydrograph and peak discharge at each junction and the outlet nodes peak discharge for the watersheds was computed and verified from published data for oshiwara zope et al 2016 dahisar eldho et al 2018 mithi zope et al 2015 and poisar kulkarni et al 2014a these values and the land use classes of the watersheds were used as inputs in the 1 d hec ras hydraulic model for performing the hydrological channel routing at subsequent downstream nodes 3 2 4 hydraulic modeling using 1 d model hec ras hec ras is a hydrodynamic model to perform one dimensional hydraulic calculations of water surface profiles in channel networks using the saint venant equations when flow conditions are approximately unidirectional input parameters required by hec ras include spatial geometric and flow data which can be imported from the outputs generated by hec hms and boundary conditions lastra et al 2008 other parameters used in hec ras are stream centerline banks flow path centerlines cross section cut lines and the attributes extracted by running hec georas which is an arc gis toolbar the entire watershed was divided into upper middle and lower reaches in hec georas such that its geometry consisted of left bank right bank and flow paths the intersections in the reaches were set at an equal interval subsequently they were extracted using the triangulated irregular network tin obtained from the dem of the watersheds usace 2011 manning s roughness coefficient n maps were prepared for the four watersheds by assigning individual manning s n to each land use class in the study area manning s n were set at 0 015 0 10 0 03 and 0 15 for built up land vegetation water body and forest as well as barren land respectively kalyanapu et al 2010 vieux 2001 zope et al 2015 moreover the geometry data was exported to hec ras for the hydraulic analysis water surface profiles were generated at different points of interest using the saint venant equations root and papakos 2010 usace 2010 tidal depth variations were set as boundary conditions in the watersheds attached to the coastal lines then the models for the watersheds were simulated using subcritical supercritical and mixed flow conditions depending upon their boundary conditions usace 2010 the peak discharge data at each junction derived from hec hms served as an input in hec ras where the hydraulic simulations were performed for 2 10 25 50 and 100 year return periods the water surface profiles and water surface extent obtained in hec ras were exported to arc gis and analyzed using the hec georas toolbar finally the flood extents and depths for different flow and land use conditions were generated by using the hec georas model for different flow and land use conditions alaghmand et al 2010 suriya and mudgal 2012 3 3 flood mapping flood maps with different flow conditions were developed for each watershed to estimate flow extent and depth in turn the maps representing flood extent and depth were used as an input for developing flood hazard and risk maps 3 3 1 flood extent and depth the results obtained from hec ras were exported to arc gis including the centerline and cross section alignments with surface elevations at the cross sections and a boundary polygon defining the maximum flood extent then hec georas was applied to conduct the post processing of the imported files by creating the water surface tin from the cross section alignment as well as by building polygon and water surface elevations hernandez and zhang 2007 besides the water surface tin was compared with the terrain tin to create the floodplain polygon this polygon represented the maximum possible flood extent according to the cross section limit maidment and djokic 2000 zope et al 2015 whilst the flood depth grids stood for the flood hazard for the study area 3 3 2 flood hazard flood hazard is defined to as a harm or danger that can be caused by an event flooding to the society environment infrastructure etc whereas flood risk is referred to as the chance that a flood hazard will actually cause some harm ogato et al 2020 flood hazard mapping is important to develop and operationalize an effective flood early warning system as well as to establish a flood insurance and risk assessment program the determination of flood hazard fig 2 was based on several criteria including slope elevation aspect land use proximity to river centerline distance from coastal bank peak discharge and maximum flood extent toosi et al 2019 zope et al 2015 zope et al 2016 thus thematic layers related to these criteria were developed to prepare a spatial hazard map for the watersheds the distances to the respective sites from the river were computed using the cost distance tool in arc gis whilst the euclidean distance tool was applied between individual sites and the coast the thematic map of runoff with peak discharge at each sub basin is provided as one of the parameters in computing hazard map the spatial representation of sub basins for all four watersheds is delineated through hec hms and is represented in fig b 3 the complete methodology to integrate peak discharge runoff to obtain flood hazard maps is described by zope et al 2015 and tingsanchali and karim 2005 similarly the flood extents generated for selected return period storm events were merged to obtain the maximum flood extent polygon which was further integrated to obtain the flood hazard map the complete methodology to integrate flood extent to obtain flood hazard maps is described by zope et al 2016 and tingsanchali and karim 2005 subsequently each criterion was ranked and their weights were obtained pramojanee et al 1997 based on their significance to cause flooding suriya and mudgal 2012 using the delphi technique lee et al 2013 the hazard map was divided into five classes i e no very low low moderate high and extreme each criterion is divided into a number of sub criteria with further effect values ev also weighing values wv are assigned to each criterion based on the significance that factor may have on flooding table 2 the spatial maps were integrated using the raster calculator toolbar in arc gis yielding a hazard map for each watershed in mumbai city the hazard map prepared was developed for the maximum flood extent i e a 100 year return period storm 3 3 3 risk assessment the risk assessment was conducted using different thematic maps and spatial information gathered from a series of municipal corporations census department insurance firms government database health departments environmental information system envis district census handbook etc spatial maps were prepared to represent the distribution of infrastructure services population hospitals schools public administration firms residential commercial and industrial properties within the sub catchments these spatial maps were further integrated with the hazard maps to assess the spatial distribution of the risks associated with four impact categories namely society economy environment and infrastructure these four impact categories were used to assess spatial risk at a micro scale level within the four watersheds of mumbai according to five classes namely no very low low medium high and extreme the social category considers the responses to a disruptive flood event such as loss of confidence change in expectations and indirect consequences of deepening inequality afifi et al 2019 bodoque et al 2016 meyer et al 2009 these impacts were analyzed and evaluated by integrating population density with the flood affected region and the availability of local infrastructure services such as education centers small firms hospitals public administrations etc the impact on rural and sub urban areas were considered to be greater than that on regions with urban or high rise buildings this effect is deemed to be independent from the size of hospitals or schools the economic category involves the financial losses that cities have to face due to flooding aroca jiménez et al 2018 ghanbarpour et al 2013 zeng et al 2019 in this study direct loss was computed based on the cost related to repairing or replacing assets for the residential commercial or industrial sectors initially the total value of assets at risk and their spatial distribution were estimated based on data from official statistics and assigned to the corresponding land use categories the total insured monetary values associated with residential commercial and industrial properties were obtained from proprietary insurance data from the rms india earthquake model the insurance penetration for mumbai city is assumed to be around 8 for residential 14 for commercial and 17 for industrial properties ranger et al 2011 since these estimates have high uncertainties and depend upon the level and quantity of damage approximate figures were considered in the analysis the residential class was addressed by obtaining the approximate value per square meter of private household inventories different for urban and rural areas ranger et al 2011 by considering the standard of living for the respective communities similarly approximate values were established for the industries by implementing asset management techniques campbell et al 2016 damage evaluation was computed spatially for each sub basin by taking into account the combination of flood depth with different damage values meyer et al 2009 the environmental category considers water quality deterioration and the associated impacts on the surroundings of the region ghanbarpour et al 2013 meyer et al 2009 the effect of flooding on the environment was evaluated in terms of flood level velocity criterion and stream power other aspects such as erosion pollution due to contamination the impacts on biodiversity and the inhabitants in the forest were also taken into account to compute the environmental risk a relative analysis was performed within the sub basins of each watershed to produce a spatial representation of these environmental impacts finally the infrastructural category corresponds to disruptions of public and private infrastructure services and their associated impacts on people who depend on them berndtsson et al 2019 darabi et al 2019 this includes the assistance of public services communication services in terms of transport such as roads trains etc electricity telecommunication networks etc these data were analyzed and processed spatially such that the services affected by flooding depth were combined in an infrastructure impact map once all the categories were addressed individually a spatial map representing the spatial distribution of total risk for each watershed was built by implementing the following set of weights 0 25 social 0 2 environmental 0 3 economic and 0 25 infrastructure 4 results and discussion the surface runoff models were implemented to estimate the direct runoff depth for the city and its watersheds subsequently the hydrological hydraulic models were used to obtain the flood extent map finally a multi criteria decision making approach was applied to obtain flood hazard and risk maps and therefore enable developing strategic plans the results associated with these tasks are explained below 4 1 runoff and infiltration nrcs cn invest model the spatial runoff and water yield maps derived from the nrcs cn and invest models for the four watersheds are represented in fig 3 dahisar mithi oshiwara and poisar were found to have 35 2 6 9 13 9 and 36 1 of their areas achieving surface flows of up to 1 460 mm when considering a threshold of 2120 mm these values were 11 3 48 6 42 2 and 24 1 in the case of mithi and oshiwara approximately half of the area was experiencing relatively high surface runoff the spatial maps of the natural water infiltration capacity for the four watersheds are presented in fig 4 dahisar mithi oshiwara and poisar included zones with an infiltration capacity of up to 110 mm that amounted to 11 5 11 3 14 3 and 13 2 of their areas respectively these values increased to 24 2 13 9 32 3 and 32 4 for an infiltration capacity of 690 mm hence a relatively high percentage of the areas of oshiwara and poisar had a high infiltration capacity the spatial surface runoff and water yield maps for the mumbai city are represented in fig b 2 a and b whilst its infiltration capacity is shown in fig b 2 c and d both nrcs cn and invest represent a similar range and spatial distribution of surface flow for the entire city 4 2 peak discharge hydraulic modelling an investigation was carried out using hec geohms and hec hms see fig b 3 for computing peak discharge table 3 presents the values of peak discharge m3 s obtained for selected return periods at the four watersheds since mithi consisted of two lakes namely vihar and powai two peak discharges were computed by including and excluding overflows from the lakes into the catchment hec georas enabled an additional division of watersheds into main streams upstream midstream and downstream and branch streams upstream tributary midstream tributary or downstream tributary as shown in fig b 3 for a 100 year return period dahisar and mithi including overflow from lakes exhibited approximately the same values of peak discharge table 3 however they differed in terms of infiltration capacity thereby demanding different strategies to manage flood risk furthermore flood depth and extent maps for the oshiwara mithi poisar and dahisar watersheds under selected return periods are represented in fig 5 4 3 flood hazard and risk mapping in the case of the 100 year return period peak discharge the flood hazard map is shown in fig 6 a significant fraction of the total area of all the watersheds were in the moderate and high classes of the hazard map table 4 the combination of areas at high and extreme hazard had a relative size of 34 2 38 3 38 9 and 42 3 for dahisar mithi oshiwara and poisar respectively furthermore the percentage area covered by different impact categories in the watersheds are tabulated in table 4 to analyze the zones under greater risk within a watershed the area under high risk and extreme risk category were merged together dahisar mithi oshiwar and poisar watersheds have areas of 10 1 26 8 13 0 and 22 2 under social risk fig 7 10 1 15 4 24 2 and 42 0 under economic loss more than 110 million usd 31 8 27 1 14 6 and 45 5 under environmental risk 27 1 24 2 42 9 and 35 9 under infrastructural impact and 35 2 24 5 43 3 and 63 4 under overall risk fig 8 in conclusion mithi followed by poisar gave the highest values for social risk and poisar followed by oshiwara gave the highest values for economic loss similarly for environmental loss the highest values gave poisar followed by dahisar and for infrastructural loss oshiwara followed by poisar gave the highest value the highest values for the overall risk taking the sum of the values of the individual risks gave poisar followed by oshiwara these watersheds are facing an overall high risk due to the presence of highly urbanized areas and densely populated suburbs it follows from the above that each watershed has a different risk profile hence a customized strategy for each watershed targeting the zones which are prone to a specific risk or a combination of specific risks will be required these figures also explain why the city is experiencing regular flooding with significant impacts almost every year in the next section the correlations between the various risks within the urban sub catchments were determined below 4 4 correlation analysis between risks a pearson correlation analysis was undertaken to determine the relationships between the risks of the watersheds a positive and significant p values 0 05 correlation indicates that a single intervention could address different risks at the same time however in the present study no specific correlation was observed see table 5 all the watersheds have different correlations and significance between paired risks for example the correlation between the economic loss and social impact was 0 52 0 27 0 31 and 0 49 for oshiwara mithi dahisar and poisar respectively 4 5 strategic planning and mitigating flood risk present strategies require amendments in order to develop a more resilient model and to effectively deal with future uncertainties since they are often based on short term solutions in recent years the concept of flood risk management has evolved and has expanded to include nature based solutions which can contribute to enhancing flood resilience and taking into account the ecosystem services they provide bertilsson et al 2019 sayers et al 2015 in addition as nature based solutions are without exception more flexible than traditional structural solutions nature based or hybrid solutions often provide more sustainable long term solutions because they are more easily adaptable to uncertain climatic change projections and projections of other changing drivers to implement traditional structural solutions governments need to secure large investments for projects which usually have long lead times 10 years and even more nature based or hybrid solutions to upgrade or replace existing flood risk management infrastructure generally do not require large investments upfront and project lead times are shorter without adequate resources and regular maintenance infrastructure can rapidly deteriorate and will no longer comply with the design standard the indian government has developed policies to prevents the construction of infrastructure near flood prone areas and encourages the installation of rainwater harvesting techniques to reduce surface runoff thus mitigating the pressure on the drainage system of the city this study reveals that there are opportunities to reduce the flood risks in the four watersheds by further enhancing their capacity using nature based or hybrid solutions to store and reuse water based on detailed spatial analyses according to the central ground water authority cgwa only 20 of the rainwater in mumbai percolates into the ground and 80 runoff ends in the sea the integration of flood hazard and risk maps with high infiltration zones within the watersheds would identify potentially suitable sites to store or infiltrate stormwater harvesting structures can be built at these locations see fig 9 for this purpose such as retaining walls water tanks etc contributing to groundwater recharge too furthermore low impact development lid techniques such as bioretention cells swales or rain gardens can be implemented at these locations in order to reuse part of the volume of groundwater recharged during dry seasons alexander et al 2019 also the poisar watershed experienced all types of risks the blue zones see fig 9 along the poisar river should be utilized to construct percolation tanks or swales to mitigate these risks as well as to build retaining walls to reduce the infrastructural and environmental impacts of flooding retaining walls along the mithi river should also be built to reduce social impacts since this watershed was found to face low levels of risks of the other categories social risk can be mitigated by educating civilians and residents in disaster management and mitigation policies this will require to launch an awareness program focused on flood preparedness to address the responsibilities of the civilians and the need for developing emergency plans as well as to establish shelters at public parks gatherings library markets etc especially in areas of the mithi and poisar watersheds a governance framework to foster stakeholder s participation including planners government and residents should be developed and implemented pathak et al 2019b similarly retaining walls should be implemented along the oshiwara river due to its high risk of economic loss and infrastructural impact economic risks are related in this study to the direct losses and flood insurance is potentially an effective measure to mitigate these risks however it will require the government to create incentives to promote the financial sector to provide long term flood protection insurance in the case of poisar and oshiwara flood insurance could be potentially effective to support the renovation of the houses of low income residents infrastructure loss comprises damage to public and private infrastructure affecting the services they provide to the residents the results reveal that there is a need to increase the resilience of local transports communication and other services in the watersheds this is especially applicable to the oshiwara and poisar watersheds because of their relatively high infrastructure vulnerability finally since dahisar experienced high environmental impacts check dams might be built to attenuate these effects along the zones where such impacts range from high to extreme environmental losses are predominantly caused by the high flow velocity of flood water river discharges the implementation of retaining walls and the widening of channels specifically at the poisar and dahisar rivers should be considered to prevent flow from causing erosion overall the implementation of these techniques would reduce pressure on natural resources thereby providing a sustainable approach to mitigate flooding this study presents a comprehensive and integrative approach to analyze flood risks and to support the identification and prioritization of interventions to mitigate these risks at the urban sub catchment level the methodology used in this study is based on a non heuristic approach it considers the spatial distribution of various types of flood risks both individually as well as aggregated with the support of gis the spatial analysis of flood risks and the identification of interventions can be performed to assist planners and stakeholders to develop a long term flood risks mitigation strategy at the urban sub catchment level while acknowledging its interaction with its surrounding environment and taking into account uncertainties associated with long term predictions 5 conclusions the responsibility for managing and reducing flood risk has always been and will remain a challenge for different parts of society under the premise that flooding has become the new normal in mumbai city this phenomenon was evaluated in this study there is a need to assist water engineers and urban planners to spatially identify locations with elevated flood risk and customize planning strategies to mitigate such risk moreover approaches are required to fill the need for integrative and strategic long term urban flood risk management plans by considering the uncertainties associated with climate change economic fluctuations and population growth the proposed methodology provides a non heuristic approach to deal with these challenges by capturing the impacts of flood risk resulting in practical measures to mitigate them by directing and treating this threat as a sustainable resource the approach taken is based upon an appropriate understanding of the whole system behavior including social economic environmental and infrastructural objectives and how risks may change over the longer term four urban watersheds in mumbai were used as a case study area no correlation was observed between the different categories of flood risk within the watersheds hence each dimension of flood risk requires a specific set of responses leading to a customized strategy for each urban catchment these customized strategies will provide the components of an overall strategic flood risk management plan for mumbai the next step will consist of integrating the patchwork of measures and instruments identified at the urban catchment level into a broader planning perspective to sustainably manage the flood risks of the city as a whole this study provides a robust technique to assess flood risk and support strategic planning with the appropriatelevelofdetail by considering non heuristic drivers it bridges the gap between the modeling and planning aspects this technique reduces the effort cost and subjectivity however it requires more time in decision planning due to the demand for spatial considerations and site specific recommendations due to the level of spatial detail large datasets from various institutions and government organizations will be needed the latter may hamper wider applications credit authorship contribution statement shray pathak conceptualization methodology formal analysis

5069,human activities have altered land use patterns and thus the hydrochemical features e g co2 aq no3 and po4 3 of watersheds influencing both the c cycle and the quality of water e g eutrophication within them the ways in which primary productivity and the dynamics of planktonic algae species composition are related to these hydrochemical changes remains unclear especially in karst waters with high ph and high concentrations of ca2 and dissolved inorganic c in this study we used the shawan karst test site puding sw china to analyze the influences of the no3 po4 3 and co2 aq concentrations on the primary productivity and dynamics of planktonic algae species composition in five spring fed ponds under different land use patterns at the site during 2018 our results show the following 1 agricultural farming increased the input of no3 po4 3 and co2 aq from springs to the ponds i e surface waters meanwhile shrub and grass lands reduced the input of no3 and po4 3 but significantly increased the input of co2 aq to the water 2 the total number of planktonic algal cells was mainly related to co2 aq in january i e the dormant period but mainly related to no3 and po4 3 in july i e the growth period this possibly due to the seasonal succession of phytoplanktonic algae species sensitivity of different nutrient elements 3 in the dormant period the system is dominated by the phytoplanktonic algal cells sensitive to co2 aq especially in grass and shrub ponds in the growth period the system is dominated by the planktonic algal cells sensitive to no3 and po4 3 however they are far less than others in grass and shrub ponds thus we predict that groundwaters with relatively high co2 aq and low no3 and po4 3 concentrations resulting from natural afforestation in karst areas may help alleviate eutrophication and increase c sequestration in the corresponding surface waters indicating the importance of land use adjustment in the management of water quality and carbon cycle keywords primary productivity planktonic algae species composition eutrophication control karst surface waters land uses 1 introduction land use patterns are among the main factors influencing ecosystem functions since they can alter the biogeochemical cycles of elements in the system vitousek et al 1997 defries et al 2004 due to the rapid growth of the global population the demand for new lands for human use has gradually increased in fact a large number of non agricultural lands have been converted into agricultural lands causing the discharge of large amounts of n and p i e nutrient sources for phytoplankton into surface waters hayes et al 2015 macdonald et al 2012 however the conversion of farmlands to plant secondary forests can reduce the output of n and p at the watershed scale hedin et al 1995 notably changes in land use patterns in karst areas can affect the concentrations of dissolved inorganic c dic including co2 aq in spring and pond surface waters chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 under the coupling interaction of water vegetation soil and microbes the dissolution of bedrock in karst areas causes an increase in the input of dic to surface water zhao et al 2010 this can be assimilated as nutrients promoting the growth and possibly causing outbreaks of planktonic algae visser et al 2016 chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 clearly changes in nutrient input affect the primary productivity and structure of planktonic algae over spatial and temporal scales jiang et al 2014 hayes et al 2015 which in turn are linked to the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems smith et al 1999 defries et al 2004 the influence of c n and p limitation in aquatic ecosystems has been debated for decades studies have shown that c n and p can all act as main limiting factors for phytoplankton growth under different environmental conditions schindler 1977 smith 1983 schindler et al 2016 visser et al 2016 previous studies have shown that bacillariophyta grows better than cyanophyta and chlorophyta under relatively low temperatures t paerl and huisman 2008 while cyanophyta and chlorophyta are more likely to outbreak in summer under relatively high temperature guo et al 2014 and in nutrient rich waters beman et al 2005 in addition cyanobacteria species tend to dominate phytoplankton assemblages in low n waters thanks to their ability of fixing n smith 1983 the presence of n fixing planktonic algae can partially alleviate the n limitation meanwhile under increasing p consumption p will become the main limiting factor for the aquatic system productivity schindler 1977 changes in the storage pattern of p in soil can further contribute to the occurrence of p limitation walker and syers 1976 c can also be an important limiting factor for planktonic algae growth shi et al 2017 however some algae can use c concentrating mechanisms ccm to gain a competitive advantage reinfelder 2011 in addition to primary productivity also the community structure of planktonic algae responds to variations in c n and p concentration in surface water padisak et al 2006 the structure of a planktonic algae community can be studied to infer its nutritional conditions for example cyanophyta and chlorophyta have been found to always dominate in eutrophic freshwaters in summer rojo et al 2000 paerl and huisman 2008 the responses of planktonic algae primary productivity and community structure to different nutritional conditions have been studied in rivers lakes and reservoirs however previous studies have mainly focused on planktonic algae at the phylum level xu et al 2017 examining the response of single planktonic algae species to nutrient elements during community succession may help in clarifying their outbreak mechanisms riebesell et al 1993 pan et al 2016 the shawan karst test site puding sw china is a large simulation test site having strictly controlled watershed boundaries and including five different land use patterns chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 thanks to the characteristics of this site it is possible to quantitatively study the effect of land use patterns on the growth of planktonic algae in its manmade spring fed pond systems chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 aquatic photosynthesis has been found to be c limited in such pond ecosystems chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 in this study we will focus on the effects of n p and c on the primary productivity and the community composition dynamics of planktonic algae in surface waters i e ponds under various land use patterns we hypothesize the following 1 land use patterns influence the input of c n and p especially co2 aq no3 po4 3 to surface waters ponds in this study in karst areas as reflected in the unique spatiotemporal hydro physiochemical characteristics 2 the phytoplankton algae primary productivity and species composition respond differently to these distinct nutrient characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site the shawan karst test site 26 14 26 15 n 105 42 105 43 e 1200 m in elevation is located in the puding comprehensive karst research and experimental station puding county guizhou province china fig 1 the area is characterized by a humid subtropical monsoon climate the annual mean air t is 15 1 c and the average annual precipitation is 1315 mm 80 of which occurs during the rainy season may october yang et al 2012 zeng et al 2017 five concrete tanks were installed at the site to simulate five different patterns of land use bare rock bare soil cultivated grass and shrub lands fig 1b each concrete tank was 20 m long 5 m wide 3 m deep and coated with epoxy resin to avoid the influence of possible concrete erosion on the tank hydrochemistry zeng et al 2017 each tank was partially filled with 2 m of dolomitic limestone gravel followed by 0 5 m of soil in the bare rock land tank however no soil was added the bare soil land tank was filled with both soil and dolomitic limestone gravel but did not contain any plants in the cultivated land instead we planted corn growing season april august and applied a compound fertilizer in mid march alfalfa and roxburgh roses were planted into the soils of the grass and shrub lands respectively in january 2014 hu et al 2018 a lateral drainage hole was present in each tank it simulated a natural karst spring 1s 5s see fig 1b which fed an artificial pond 1p 5p the pond which simulated a lake or reservoir was 3 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 5 m deep fig 1c thus each tank and its connected pond system fig 1b c simulated a single land use catchment with precisely known identical dimensions all the simulated catchments had the same climatic and geological conditions chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 hu et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 water containing planktonic algae was collected from a nearby karst surface river and poured into the ponds on october 31 2017 the planktonic algae were hence left to grow in the pond waters our monitoring sampling and analyses began in january 2018 and the experiment lasted until december 2018 when locally dominant submerged plants i e spirogyra hornwort and charophyta were transplanted into each spring fed pond 2 2 field monitoring the fieldwork was carried out on one sunny day at the end of each month so to reduce weather related effects t ph electrical conductivity ec 25 c and dissolved oxygen do were monitored by using a multi parameter water quality probe wissenschaftlich technische werkstaetten technology multiline 350i germany before using it we calibrated the parameter sensors as follows ph 4 01 and 6 86 ec 1412 μs cm do 100 air the measuring accuracies of the device for the ph t do and ec were 0 01 0 01 c 0 01 mg l and 0 01 μs cm respectively moreover dic chiefly in the form of hco3 was titrated in the field by using an aquamerck alkalinity test kit merck germany with an estimated accuracy of 0 05 mmol l zeng et al 2017 the co2 aq concentration was calculated by software phreeqc and using field measured temperature ph and alkalinity 2 3 sample collection and laboratory measurements a syringe was used to draw water from the pond then the water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm millipore filters and put into 100 ml acid washed glass bottles and 20 ml plastic square bottles hdpe for the analysis of anions and cations respectively ca2 concentration was measured with an ics 90 ion chromatograph no3 concentration with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes and po4 3 concentration by the mo sb colorimetric method he et al 2019 gong et al 2012 water 2 l was collected and filtered through 0 45 μm filters jinpin 47 mm 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane after filtration the membrane was frozen then we applied 95 hot ethanol for the determination of chlorophyll a following the procedure of sartory and grobbelaar 1984 qualitative plankton samples were collected directly from the water using a plankton net mesh size 0 064 mm in a shape and then placed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes moreover in order to determine the number of cells for each planktonic algae species we collected 4 l of water and added to them 4 formalin to enhance the specimens preservation after returning to the laboratory this water sample was concentrated to 30 ml to allow quantitative and qualitative analyses of the planktonic algae the single specimens were identified at the species genus level by inverted microscope shi et al 2017 hillebrand et al 1999 2 4 data analyses the correlations between the hydrochemical parameters the primary productivity of planktonic algae chlorophyll a and or algae density their community structure and species composition were depicted using sigmaplot 12 5 3 results 3 1 physiochemical features of the springwaters the physiochemical features of the five springs 1s 5s showed both monthly and seasonal variations fig 2 the t ranged between 5 4 and 24 9 c the lowest and the highest occurring in february and july respectively fig 2a the ph ranged between 7 30 and 8 42 reaching its lowest value in june fig 2b furthermore the ph values showed a general decrease from 1s bare rock land to 2s bare soil land 3s cultivated land 5s shrub land and 4s grass land fig 2b meanwhile the ec ranged between 201 2 and 515 3 μs cm and showed a general decrease from 4s to 3s 5s 2s and 1s fig 2c the hco3 concentration also showed some variability fig 2d it ranged between 1 5 and 5 6 mmol l and showed a general decrease from 4s to 5s 3s 2s and 1s notably hco3 concentration increased significantly in 3s and 4s during the growth season the no3 concentration ranged between 0 05 and 30 34 mg l fig 2e reaching its maximum and minimum values in 3s in march and in 5s in january respectively interestingly the data showed a significant peak in 3s during the growth season overall the no3 concentration showed a general decrease from 3s to 2s 1s 4s and 5s the po4 3 concentration ranged between 0 0011 and 0 0161 mg l fig 2f reaching its highest and lowest values in 3s in may and in 5s in december respectively a significant peak was noted in 3s during the growth season while a smaller peak occurred in 2s between april and july overall the po4 3 and no3 concentrations showed similar trends 3 2 physiochemical features of the pond waters the physiochemical parameters of the waters contained in the five ponds 1p 5p showed both monthly and seasonal variations fig 3 their t ranged from 3 8 c in february to 29 7 c in june as for the springs no significant differences were observed between the water t of different ponds fig 3a however pond water t tended to be lower in autumn and winter than in spring and summer the ph ranged between 7 40 and 9 50 fig 3b and it was higher in the pond than in the springwaters during the experimental period the ec ranged between 181 6 and 467 6 μs cm fig 3c and due to the precipitation of caco3 resulting mainly from aquatic photosynthesis it was lower in the pond than in the springwaters chen et al 2017 the ec generally decreased from 4p to 5p 3p 2p and 1p during the experimental period fig 3c a plateau of ec was observed in 4p between may and august while the ec values in 1p 2p and 5p showed a decreasing trend during the same period fig 3c the hco3 concentrations ranged between 1 1 and 5 3 mmol l fig 3d changes in this parameter in the pond waters were similar to those observed for the springwaters however the hco3 concentration in the pond waters was always lower than in the corresponding springwaters due to the photosynthetic consumption of aquatic autophototrophs in the former chen et al 2017 the no3 concentrations ranged between 0 01 and 18 41 mg l reaching their maximum in 3p in june and their minimum in 5p in august fig 3e additionally the no3 values were always lower in the pond waters than in the corresponding springwaters due to the metabolic consumption of aquatic organisms in the former zeng et al 2019 the po4 3 concentrations ranged between 0 0013 and 0 0075 mg l fig 3f in spring summer and autumn the po4 3 values in the pond waters were generally lower than in the corresponding springwaters however the opposite trend was observed in winter these results may derive from the decomposition of the organic matter which should have caused the release of p into the water interestingly a significant peak in po4 3 concentration was noted in 3p during the growth season this represents an attribute inherited from the corresponding spring 3s 3 3 primary productivity in the pond waters primary productivity in the pond waters was characterized based on chlorophyll a and planktonic algae density fig 4 chlorophyll a ranged between 0 04 and 4 15 mg m3 and was particularly high during the growing season i e march october when the t was high low values of chlorophyll a were instead observed during the dormant season i e january february and december when the t was low fig 4a during the growing period chlorophyll a increased significantly in all ponds especially in 3p and 4p in march and april with time the chlorophyll a became higher in 1p 2p and 3p than in 4p and 5p especially in june october fig 4a the highest chlorophyll a values were registered in 4p in march and april in concomitance with high hco3 concentrations moreover chlorophyll a concentrations were particularly high in 3p in may october in concomitance with high no3 and po4 3 concentrations fig 4 also indicated that with the growth of planktonic algae the concentration of chlorophyll a tended to decrease from 3p to 2p 1p 4p and 5p this decreasing order is consistent with that noted for the no3 and po4 3 concentrations in the springwaters which in fact supply nutrients to the ponds the planktonic algae density ranged between 254 and 8 919 cells ml the highest value was registered in 3p in july and the lowest in 4p in october in january april july and october the order of planktonic algae density was consistent with that of chlorophyll a concentration indicating that both of these parameters well represented the primary productivity of planktonic algae during the experimental period 3 4 planktonic algae abundance and community structure dynamics in the pond waters the planktonic algae abundance and community structure during the study period are shown in fig 5 a total of 62 species 22 of which were dominant by dominance index weaver 1949 were identified in the five ponds during the experimental period the average number of planktonic algae species was 18 in 1p 22 in 2p 26 in 3p 21 in 4p and 15 in 5p the highest and lowest number of planktonic algae species were identified in 3p and 5p respectively all of the 62 identified species belonged to one of the following cyanophyta chlorophyta bacillariophyta cryptophyta euglenophyta and pyrrophyta among these six phyla chlorophyta and bacillariophyta were the most abundant and dominated the planktonic algae community in the five ponds during the experimental period while cryptophyta was the less abundant fig 5 in 1p the planktonic algae community was dominated by bacillariophyta in winter and all of the six classes of planktonic algae occurred in this season during spring the abundances of cyanophyta chlorophyta and bacillariophyta decreased while those of cryptophyta euglenophyta and pyrrophyta increased nevertheless bacillariophyta continued to dominate the planktonic algae community throughout the season during summer the abundance of chlorophyta increased while that of bacillariophyta decreased and chlorophyta dominated the planktonic algae community in autumn cryptophyta disappeared while bacillariophyta dominated the planktonic algae community in 2p the planktonic algae community was dominated by chlorophyta in winter and summer in spring however the abundance of bacillariophyta exceeded that of chlorophyta moreover the community was dominated by both bacillariophyta and chlorophyta in autumn relative abundance 40 in both cases while cryptophyta did not occur in 3p the planktonic algae community was dominated by bacillariophyta in spring summer and autumn however chlorophyta exceeded bacillariophyta in winter in 4p the phytoplankton community was dominated by chlorophyta in summer and winter while bacillariophyta exceeded chlorophyta in autumn in spring bacillariophyta and chlorophyta dominated the community together relative abundance 30 in both cases in 5p cyanophyta did not occur during summer while cryptophyta never occurred during the experimental period table 1 shows the spatiotemporal dynamics of the dominant planktonic algae species succession in the five ponds a total of 22 dominant species were identified moreover the dominant species in each pond showed a significant seasonal succession table 1 cyclotella meneghiniana fragilaria capucina synedra acus kützing trachelomonas granulosa pandorina morum and aphanocapsa delicatissima occurred mainly in january and april while microcystis aeruginosa pseudoanabaena sp and some other dominant species occurred mainly in july and november however navicula simplex was distributed in all ponds during the whole year in addition although some species dominated the planktonic algae communities in the five ponds their cell number varied considerably among such ponds for example cyclotella meneghiniana trachelomonas granulosa and ceratium hirundinella showed lower cell numbers in 1p 2p and 3p but higher cell numbers in 4p and 5p meanwhile navicula simplex microcystis aeruginosa cymbella pusilla chlorella vulgaris and some other dominant species showed higher cell numbers in 1p 2p and 3p but lower cell numbers in 4p and 5p 4 discussion 4 1 effects of land use patterns on the springwaters hydrochemical features land use patterns can affect the soil and groundwater hydrochemical parameters via plant and microbial activities mganga et al 2016 zhao et al 2010 zeng et al 2017 in spring the hydrochemical parameters i e ph ec hco3 no3 and po4 3 of the springwaters varied considerably under different land uses fig 2 these differences indicate that land use patterns have an important impact on karst hydrochemistry a previous study zeng et al 2017 has shown the occurrence of significant differences in soil co2 under different land uses after rainfall soil co2 dissolves into soil water in the form of h2co3 the water reacts with the carbonate rock creating groundwater with high dic including co2 aq hco3 and co3 2 liu and dreybrodt 2015 the springs under grass and shrub land conditions and with the highest vegetation coverage i e 4s and 5s showed the lowest ph as well as the highest ec and hco3 values fig 2b 2c and 2d meanwhile the springs under bare rock and bare soil land conditions and without vegetation coverage i e 1s and 2s showed the highest ph as well as the lowest ec and hco3 values fig 2b 2c and 2d the spring under cultivated land conditions i e 3s changed similarly to the springs under shrub and grass land conditions during the growth period and to those under bare rock and bare soil land conditions during the dormant period fig 2b 2c and 2d these features reflect differences in soil respiration root biomass and soil microbial activity tend to be high under shrub grass and cultivated land conditions jia et al 2010 costa et al 2013 overall these data indicate that land use affects c dynamics in soil and karst underground water over spatial and temporal sequences liu et al 2007 yang et al 2012 zeng et al 2017 fig 6 further shows the effects of different land uses on the hydrochemistry of groundwater and spring water soil co2 was strongly correlated with the concentrations of ca2 dic and co2 aq in both types of water significant differences may exist in the nutrient concentrations of soil and groundwater under different land use patterns xiao et al 2017 fig 2e shows that the concentration of no3 in springs decreased from cultivated to bare soil bare rock grass and shrub lands during the growth period the spring concentration of no3 in shrub and grass lands with high vegetation coverage was significantly lower than that in bare rock bare soil and cultivated lands this may be because the growth of vegetation consumes a large amount of n in the soil xu et al 2012 or caused by the flow system difference for vegetation can change in soil flow patterns a lot the springs under bare rock and bare soil land conditions may have presented higher no3 concentrations due to the atmospheric deposition of n yu et al 2019 the concentrations of no3 in s3 under cultivated land conditions were lower before march during the dry dormant season but increased between april october during the rainy season notably a compound fertilizer was applied in april for corn cultivation with the increase of rainfall in may a large amount of n was leached into the spring li et al 2010 during spring the variation in po4 3 and no3 concentrations showed similar features except under bare rock land conditions in which case the po4 3 concentrations were lower xiao et al 2017 gelaw et al 2015 in summary our research demonstrated a significant impact of agricultural cultivation on nutrient concentrations in groundwater this aspect needs to be considered when evaluating the nutrient supply to surface water ecosystems 4 2 effects of karst spring hydrochemistry on planktonic algae primary productivity as discussed above the hydrochemistry of karst springwaters shows distinct temporal and spatial variations under different land use patterns differences in the hydrochemistry of such waters may affect the primary productivity of planktonic algae in the respective surface waters jiang et al 2014 hayes et al 2015 here we used chlorophyll a and planktonic algae density to characterize the primary productivity balch et al 1992 chowdhury et al 2017 after analyzing the level of chlorophyll a we were able to divide the experimental period into a growth period march october characterized by higher chlorophyll a concentrations and a dormant period november february characterized by lower chlorophyll a concentrations fig 4a fig 7 and fig 8 show the relationship between the hydrochemical parameters of the springwaters and the primary productivity of planktonic algae in the ponds during the dormant e g in january see fig 7 and growth e g in july see fig 8 periods planktonic algae primary productivity i e planktonic algae density appeared more sensitive to co2 aq fig 7a than to no3 fig 7b or po4 3 fig 7c in the dormant period when dic concentrations were low fig 2d however in the growth period planktonic algae primary productivity was highly sensitive to no3 fig 8b and po4 3 fig 8c this may be partly related to the seasonal structural succession of planktonic algae having different adaptabilities under different hydrochemical environments xu et al 2015 our results further show a decrease in cyanophyta and chlorophyta as well as an increase in bacillariophyta from january dormant period to april growth period fig 5 however cyanophyta and chlorophyta increased and bacillariophyta decreased from april to july fig 5 no3 or po4 3 showed stronger significant positive correlations with planktonic algae primary productivity than hco3 and co2 aq fig 7 indicating that cyanophyta and chlorophyta were more adaptable than bacillariophyta to the hydrochemical parameters typically verified during hot summers beman et al 2005 hayes et al 2015 4 3 response of planktonic algae species to changes in c n or p concentrations it has been shown that the primary productivity of planktonic algae can be limited by n p or both of them howarth and marino 2006 schindler et al 2016 tyrrell 1999 some other studies also consider c as an important limiting factor riebesell et al 1993 visser et al 2016 zeng et al 2019 however the above studies have only focused on the total biomass or productivity ignoring any differences in the response of single planktonic algae species to c n and p input to the system riebesell et al 1993 shi et al 2017 here in order to reveal the distinct response mechanisms of planktonic algae species to spatial and temporal differences in c n and p in ponds we analyzed their cells separately in january the correlation between the total number of planktonic algal cells and co2 aq r2 0 42 p 0 42 was higher than that between the total number of planktonic algal cells and no3 r2 0 01 p 0 89 or po4 3 r2 0 17 p 0 48 fig 7 by analyzing the elemental preference of planktonic algal cells we found that cyclotella meneghiniana was sensitive to co2 aq these results support the opinion that this species would clearly respond to changes in co2 aq shi et al 2017 we also found that aphanocapsa delicatissima and trachelomonas granulosa may have a response mechanism to co2 aq similar to that of cyclotella meneghiniana the results shown in fig 7 suggest that synedra acus kützing navicula simplex and pandorina morum were sensitive to the concentration of no3 their cell numbers increased with no3 concentration similarly to what was found by pan and wang 2016 furthermore eudorina elegans euastrum ansutum and pseudoanabaena sp were sensitive to both no3 and po4 3 in january planktonic algal cells seemed to be overall more sensitive to changes in the concentration of co2 aq rather than in no3 and po4 3 however the response of planktonic algae species to c n and p were significantly different in july the total number of planktonic algal cells had a lower correlation with co2 aq r2 0 17 p 0 49 fig 8a than with no3 r2 0 95 p 0 01 fig 8b or po4 3 r2 0 97 p 0 01 fig 8c these results indicated that the growth of planktonic algae is more likely to be limited by n and p during the growing season howarth and marino 2006 schindler et al 2016 fig 8 also shows the cell number of several element sensitive planktonic algae species was one order of magnitude higher in july than in january among the planktonic algae sensitive to co2 aq cyclotella meneghiniana and aphanocapsa delicatissima were replaced by merismopedia tenuissima scenedesmus bijuba and coelastrum sp in july while trachelomonas granulosa continued to occur combining these results with those shown in fig 5 we can infer that cyanophyta and chlorophyta tend to grow and bloom in summer under higher t while bacillariophyta tends to be replaced rojo et al 2000 paerl and huisman 2008 fig 8 shows that the planktonic algae species sensitive to n and p tend coincide since the n and p concentration gradients presented the same trends in all springs during this period as evidenced in fig 2 we found that synedra acus kützing pandorina morum eudorina elegans and pseudoanabaena sp which are sensitive to the concentration of no3 and or po4 3 were replaced by microcystis aeruginosa chlorella vulgaris cymbella pusilla spirogyra communis and cladophora sp during this period while navicula simplex and euastrum ansutum continued to occur this may be due to changes in t and in the ratio of c n and p which result in the succession of planktonic algae sensitive to different elements hayes et al 2015 xu et al 2015 joehnk et al 2008 moreover our study demonstrates that coelastrum sp which belongs to chlorophyta was sensitive to co2 aq as also found by shi et al 2017 therefore from the dormant to the growth period planktonic algae broke out in succession based on their sensitivities to c n and p past eutrophication studies have mainly focused on the succession of planktonic algae species visser et al 2016 skinner et al 2013 the results of our study indicate that the elemental sensitivity of different planktonic algae species should probably be investigated to further clarify the causes of planktonic algae outbreaks to conclude most of the phytoplanktonic algae sensitive to no3 and po4 3 belong to cyanophyta and chlorophyta while most of those sensitive to co2 aq belong to bacillariophyta element stoichiometric ratios have been widely applied to investigate the effects of nutrient limitation on primary productivity in aquatic ecosystems rhee 1978 klausmeier et al 2008 in the present study in order to clarify which element play a key role in the primary productivity of planktonic algae we considered the values of co2 aq tn co2 aq tp and tn tp weight radio in the springwaters in both january and july and examined their correlations to the number of planktonic algal cells in the pond waters fig 9 there is a significant correlation between phytoplankton algae density and co2 aq tp r2 0 43 p 0 05 fig 9b in january indicating that planktonic algae might be more affected by c or p during the low t dormant period however the correlation coefficient of tn tp r2 0 84 p 0 01 fig 9f was significantly higher than those of co2 aq tn r2 0 49 p 0 01 fig 9d and co2 aq tp r2 0 25 p 0 01 fig 9e in july indicating that planktonic algae were mainly limited by n during the high t growth period to further reveal the regulating effects of c n and or p on planktonic algae the number of cells sensitive to co2 aq no3 and po4 3 in each pond were counted and their proportion with respect to the total number of cells were calculated according to the results shown in fig 7 and fig 8 fig 10 shows the concentrations of dic co2 aq no3 and po4 3 in the springwaters and the proportion of cells of element sensitive planktonic algae species in the five ponds under different land uses in january winter fig 10a and july summer fig 10b it was found that the proportion of planktonic algal cells sensitive to dic co2 aq no3 and po4 3 was consistent with their concentration distribution in the five springs in january and july the primary productivity of planktonic algae seems to be regulated not only by n and p but also by c howarth and marino 2006 schindler et al 2016 shi et al 2017 c limitation occurred mainly during the dormant period while n and p limitation were readily observed in the growing season this may be because the number of planktonic algal cells sensitive to n and p during the growing season is much higher than the number of those sensitive to c in this case although c response phenomena occurred the overall performance of planktonic algae would have depended on n and p availability during the growth period we also found that in january under low t the proportion of phytoplanktonic algal cells sensitive to no3 and po4 3 in the ponds accounted for 30 while the proportion of cells sensitive to co2 aq or dic accounted for 62 71 and 30 54 in the ponds under grass and shrub land conditions respectively therefore the proportion of phytoplanktonic algal cells sensitive to other elements possibly si or fe hutchins et al 2001 in the ponds under land use patterns other that grass land was 50 in the growing period the proportion of phytoplanktonic algal cells sensitive to no3 and po4 3 accounted for 90 5 95 3 and 92 4 in the ponds under bare rock bare soil and cultivated land conditions respectively meanwhile their proportion accounted for only 49 6 and 42 8 in the ponds under grass and shrub land conditions respectively the proportion of phytoplanktonic algal cells sensitive to co2 aq and other elements accounted for 50 4 57 2 in the ponds under grass and shrub land conditions respectively furthermore under grass and shrub land conditions the pond waters were all characterized by higher co2 aq and lower no3 and po4 3 these results indicates that the springs hydrochemistry under shrub and grass land conditions compared to that under bare rock bare soil and cultivated land conditions promoted the growth of c or other elements sensitive species in the corresponding surface waters this in turn may have contributed to the alleviation of phytoplanktonic algae outbreaks jiang et al 2014 hayes et al 2015 5 conclusions based on the shawan karst test site we studied the primary productivity and planktonic algae species composition dynamics in karst surface waters under different land use patterns our data indicate that the growth of shrubs and grasses caused a consumption of n and p as well as the production and addition of abundant co2 into the soil this resulted in lower no3 and po4 3 concentrations but also in higher co2 aq in the springwaters meanwhile the consumption of less n and p and lower soil co2 under the bare rock and bare soil land conditions resulted in springs waters with higher no3 and po4 3 concentrations and lower co2 aq cultivated lands were characterized by lower no3 po4 3 and co2 aq values during the dormant period but higher values during the growth period after the plantation of corn the fertilization of the cultivated lands had a long lasting effect on the springs hydrochemical features the relationship between the total number of planktonic algal cells and co2 aq no3 and po4 3 varies with the season this indicates that planktonic algae primary productivity was regulated by seasonal changes in no3 po4 3 and co2 aq which might have been caused by the seasonal succession of phytoplanktonic algae species sensitive to different nutrient elements further analyses showed that the proportion of phytoplanktonic algal cells sensitive to co2 aq dominated by cyclotella meneghiniana in the ponds under grass and shrub land conditions higher than other ponds in the dormant period in the growth period instead the proportion of phytoplanktonic algal cells dominated by microcystis aeruginosa chlorella vulgaris and cladophora sp was mainly sensitive to no3 and po4 3 in the ponds under bare rock bare soil and cultivated land conditions however the proportion sensitive to co2 aq and other elements dominated by trachelomonas granulosa in the ponds under grass and shrub land conditions is higher than other ponds to conclude the springs hydrochemical features under shrub and grass land conditions i e higher co2 aq but lower no3 and po4 3 compared to those under bare rock bare soil and cultivated land conditions promoted the growth of c sensitive species in their corresponding surface waters it is thus predicted thatgroundwaters with relatively high co2 aq and low no3 and po4 3 deriving by natural afforestation in karst areas may help to alleviate eutrophication and increase c sequestration in the corresponding surface waters indicating the importance of land use adjustment in the management of water quality and carbon cycle credit authorship contribution statement qian bao writing original

5069,human activities have altered land use patterns and thus the hydrochemical features e g co2 aq no3 and po4 3 of watersheds influencing both the c cycle and the quality of water e g eutrophication within them the ways in which primary productivity and the dynamics of planktonic algae species composition are related to these hydrochemical changes remains unclear especially in karst waters with high ph and high concentrations of ca2 and dissolved inorganic c in this study we used the shawan karst test site puding sw china to analyze the influences of the no3 po4 3 and co2 aq concentrations on the primary productivity and dynamics of planktonic algae species composition in five spring fed ponds under different land use patterns at the site during 2018 our results show the following 1 agricultural farming increased the input of no3 po4 3 and co2 aq from springs to the ponds i e surface waters meanwhile shrub and grass lands reduced the input of no3 and po4 3 but significantly increased the input of co2 aq to the water 2 the total number of planktonic algal cells was mainly related to co2 aq in january i e the dormant period but mainly related to no3 and po4 3 in july i e the growth period this possibly due to the seasonal succession of phytoplanktonic algae species sensitivity of different nutrient elements 3 in the dormant period the system is dominated by the phytoplanktonic algal cells sensitive to co2 aq especially in grass and shrub ponds in the growth period the system is dominated by the planktonic algal cells sensitive to no3 and po4 3 however they are far less than others in grass and shrub ponds thus we predict that groundwaters with relatively high co2 aq and low no3 and po4 3 concentrations resulting from natural afforestation in karst areas may help alleviate eutrophication and increase c sequestration in the corresponding surface waters indicating the importance of land use adjustment in the management of water quality and carbon cycle keywords primary productivity planktonic algae species composition eutrophication control karst surface waters land uses 1 introduction land use patterns are among the main factors influencing ecosystem functions since they can alter the biogeochemical cycles of elements in the system vitousek et al 1997 defries et al 2004 due to the rapid growth of the global population the demand for new lands for human use has gradually increased in fact a large number of non agricultural lands have been converted into agricultural lands causing the discharge of large amounts of n and p i e nutrient sources for phytoplankton into surface waters hayes et al 2015 macdonald et al 2012 however the conversion of farmlands to plant secondary forests can reduce the output of n and p at the watershed scale hedin et al 1995 notably changes in land use patterns in karst areas can affect the concentrations of dissolved inorganic c dic including co2 aq in spring and pond surface waters chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 under the coupling interaction of water vegetation soil and microbes the dissolution of bedrock in karst areas causes an increase in the input of dic to surface water zhao et al 2010 this can be assimilated as nutrients promoting the growth and possibly causing outbreaks of planktonic algae visser et al 2016 chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 clearly changes in nutrient input affect the primary productivity and structure of planktonic algae over spatial and temporal scales jiang et al 2014 hayes et al 2015 which in turn are linked to the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems smith et al 1999 defries et al 2004 the influence of c n and p limitation in aquatic ecosystems has been debated for decades studies have shown that c n and p can all act as main limiting factors for phytoplankton growth under different environmental conditions schindler 1977 smith 1983 schindler et al 2016 visser et al 2016 previous studies have shown that bacillariophyta grows better than cyanophyta and chlorophyta under relatively low temperatures t paerl and huisman 2008 while cyanophyta and chlorophyta are more likely to outbreak in summer under relatively high temperature guo et al 2014 and in nutrient rich waters beman et al 2005 in addition cyanobacteria species tend to dominate phytoplankton assemblages in low n waters thanks to their ability of fixing n smith 1983 the presence of n fixing planktonic algae can partially alleviate the n limitation meanwhile under increasing p consumption p will become the main limiting factor for the aquatic system productivity schindler 1977 changes in the storage pattern of p in soil can further contribute to the occurrence of p limitation walker and syers 1976 c can also be an important limiting factor for planktonic algae growth shi et al 2017 however some algae can use c concentrating mechanisms ccm to gain a competitive advantage reinfelder 2011 in addition to primary productivity also the community structure of planktonic algae responds to variations in c n and p concentration in surface water padisak et al 2006 the structure of a planktonic algae community can be studied to infer its nutritional conditions for example cyanophyta and chlorophyta have been found to always dominate in eutrophic freshwaters in summer rojo et al 2000 paerl and huisman 2008 the responses of planktonic algae primary productivity and community structure to different nutritional conditions have been studied in rivers lakes and reservoirs however previous studies have mainly focused on planktonic algae at the phylum level xu et al 2017 examining the response of single planktonic algae species to nutrient elements during community succession may help in clarifying their outbreak mechanisms riebesell et al 1993 pan et al 2016 the shawan karst test site puding sw china is a large simulation test site having strictly controlled watershed boundaries and including five different land use patterns chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 thanks to the characteristics of this site it is possible to quantitatively study the effect of land use patterns on the growth of planktonic algae in its manmade spring fed pond systems chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 aquatic photosynthesis has been found to be c limited in such pond ecosystems chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 in this study we will focus on the effects of n p and c on the primary productivity and the community composition dynamics of planktonic algae in surface waters i e ponds under various land use patterns we hypothesize the following 1 land use patterns influence the input of c n and p especially co2 aq no3 po4 3 to surface waters ponds in this study in karst areas as reflected in the unique spatiotemporal hydro physiochemical characteristics 2 the phytoplankton algae primary productivity and species composition respond differently to these distinct nutrient characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site the shawan karst test site 26 14 26 15 n 105 42 105 43 e 1200 m in elevation is located in the puding comprehensive karst research and experimental station puding county guizhou province china fig 1 the area is characterized by a humid subtropical monsoon climate the annual mean air t is 15 1 c and the average annual precipitation is 1315 mm 80 of which occurs during the rainy season may october yang et al 2012 zeng et al 2017 five concrete tanks were installed at the site to simulate five different patterns of land use bare rock bare soil cultivated grass and shrub lands fig 1b each concrete tank was 20 m long 5 m wide 3 m deep and coated with epoxy resin to avoid the influence of possible concrete erosion on the tank hydrochemistry zeng et al 2017 each tank was partially filled with 2 m of dolomitic limestone gravel followed by 0 5 m of soil in the bare rock land tank however no soil was added the bare soil land tank was filled with both soil and dolomitic limestone gravel but did not contain any plants in the cultivated land instead we planted corn growing season april august and applied a compound fertilizer in mid march alfalfa and roxburgh roses were planted into the soils of the grass and shrub lands respectively in january 2014 hu et al 2018 a lateral drainage hole was present in each tank it simulated a natural karst spring 1s 5s see fig 1b which fed an artificial pond 1p 5p the pond which simulated a lake or reservoir was 3 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 5 m deep fig 1c thus each tank and its connected pond system fig 1b c simulated a single land use catchment with precisely known identical dimensions all the simulated catchments had the same climatic and geological conditions chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 hu et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 water containing planktonic algae was collected from a nearby karst surface river and poured into the ponds on october 31 2017 the planktonic algae were hence left to grow in the pond waters our monitoring sampling and analyses began in january 2018 and the experiment lasted until december 2018 when locally dominant submerged plants i e spirogyra hornwort and charophyta were transplanted into each spring fed pond 2 2 field monitoring the fieldwork was carried out on one sunny day at the end of each month so to reduce weather related effects t ph electrical conductivity ec 25 c and dissolved oxygen do were monitored by using a multi parameter water quality probe wissenschaftlich technische werkstaetten technology multiline 350i germany before using it we calibrated the parameter sensors as follows ph 4 01 and 6 86 ec 1412 μs cm do 100 air the measuring accuracies of the device for the ph t do and ec were 0 01 0 01 c 0 01 mg l and 0 01 μs cm respectively moreover dic chiefly in the form of hco3 was titrated in the field by using an aquamerck alkalinity test kit merck germany with an estimated accuracy of 0 05 mmol l zeng et al 2017 the co2 aq concentration was calculated by software phreeqc and using field measured temperature ph and alkalinity 2 3 sample collection and laboratory measurements a syringe was used to draw water from the pond then the water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm millipore filters and put into 100 ml acid washed glass bottles and 20 ml plastic square bottles hdpe for the analysis of anions and cations respectively ca2 concentration was measured with an ics 90 ion chromatograph no3 concentration with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes and po4 3 concentration by the mo sb colorimetric method he et al 2019 gong et al 2012 water 2 l was collected and filtered through 0 45 μm filters jinpin 47 mm 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane after filtration the membrane was frozen then we applied 95 hot ethanol for the determination of chlorophyll a following the procedure of sartory and grobbelaar 1984 qualitative plankton samples were collected directly from the water using a plankton net mesh size 0 064 mm in a shape and then placed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes moreover in order to determine the number of cells for each planktonic algae species we collected 4 l of water and added to them 4 formalin to enhance the specimens preservation after returning to the laboratory this water sample was concentrated to 30 ml to allow quantitative and qualitative analyses of the planktonic algae the single specimens were identified at the species genus level by inverted microscope shi et al 2017 hillebrand et al 1999 2 4 data analyses the correlations between the hydrochemical parameters the primary productivity of planktonic algae chlorophyll a and or algae density their community structure and species composition were depicted using sigmaplot 12 5 3 results 3 1 physiochemical features of the springwaters the physiochemical features of the five springs 1s 5s showed both monthly and seasonal variations fig 2 the t ranged between 5 4 and 24 9 c the lowest and the highest occurring in february and july respectively fig 2a the ph ranged between 7 30 and 8 42 reaching its lowest value in june fig 2b furthermore the ph values showed a general decrease from 1s bare rock land to 2s bare soil land 3s cultivated land 5s shrub land and 4s grass land fig 2b meanwhile the ec ranged between 201 2 and 515 3 μs cm and showed a general decrease from 4s to 3s 5s 2s and 1s fig 2c the hco3 concentration also showed some variability fig 2d it ranged between 1 5 and 5 6 mmol l and showed a general decrease from 4s to 5s 3s 2s and 1s notably hco3 concentration increased significantly in 3s and 4s during the growth season the no3 concentration ranged between 0 05 and 30 34 mg l fig 2e reaching its maximum and minimum values in 3s in march and in 5s in january respectively interestingly the data showed a significant peak in 3s during the growth season overall the no3 concentration showed a general decrease from 3s to 2s 1s 4s and 5s the po4 3 concentration ranged between 0 0011 and 0 0161 mg l fig 2f reaching its highest and lowest values in 3s in may and in 5s in december respectively a significant peak was noted in 3s during the growth season while a smaller peak occurred in 2s between april and july overall the po4 3 and no3 concentrations showed similar trends 3 2 physiochemical features of the pond waters the physiochemical parameters of the waters contained in the five ponds 1p 5p showed both monthly and seasonal variations fig 3 their t ranged from 3 8 c in february to 29 7 c in june as for the springs no significant differences were observed between the water t of different ponds fig 3a however pond water t tended to be lower in autumn and winter than in spring and summer the ph ranged between 7 40 and 9 50 fig 3b and it was higher in the pond than in the springwaters during the experimental period the ec ranged between 181 6 and 467 6 μs cm fig 3c and due to the precipitation of caco3 resulting mainly from aquatic photosynthesis it was lower in the pond than in the springwaters chen et al 2017 the ec generally decreased from 4p to 5p 3p 2p and 1p during the experimental period fig 3c a plateau of ec was observed in 4p between may and august while the ec values in 1p 2p and 5p showed a decreasing trend during the same period fig 3c the hco3 concentrations ranged between 1 1 and 5 3 mmol l fig 3d changes in this parameter in the pond waters were similar to those observed for the springwaters however the hco3 concentration in the pond waters was always lower than in the corresponding springwaters due to the photosynthetic consumption of aquatic autophototrophs in the former chen et al 2017 the no3 concentrations ranged between 0 01 and 18 41 mg l reaching their maximum in 3p in june and their minimum in 5p in august fig 3e additionally the no3 values were always lower in the pond waters than in the corresponding springwaters due to the metabolic consumption of aquatic organisms in the former zeng et al 2019 the po4 3 concentrations ranged between 0 0013 and 0 0075 mg l fig 3f in spring summer and autumn the po4 3 values in the pond waters were generally lower than in the corresponding springwaters however the opposite trend was observed in winter these results may derive from the decomposition of the organic matter which should have caused the release of p into the water interestingly a significant peak in po4 3 concentration was noted in 3p during the growth season this represents an attribute inherited from the corresponding spring 3s 3 3 primary productivity in the pond waters primary productivity in the pond waters was characterized based on chlorophyll a and planktonic algae density fig 4 chlorophyll a ranged between 0 04 and 4 15 mg m3 and was particularly high during the growing season i e march october when the t was high low values of chlorophyll a were instead observed during the dormant season i e january february and december when the t was low fig 4a during the growing period chlorophyll a increased significantly in all ponds especially in 3p and 4p in march and april with time the chlorophyll a became higher in 1p 2p and 3p than in 4p and 5p especially in june october fig 4a the highest chlorophyll a values were registered in 4p in march and april in concomitance with high hco3 concentrations moreover chlorophyll a concentrations were particularly high in 3p in may october in concomitance with high no3 and po4 3 concentrations fig 4 also indicated that with the growth of planktonic algae the concentration of chlorophyll a tended to decrease from 3p to 2p 1p 4p and 5p this decreasing order is consistent with that noted for the no3 and po4 3 concentrations in the springwaters which in fact supply nutrients to the ponds the planktonic algae density ranged between 254 and 8 919 cells ml the highest value was registered in 3p in july and the lowest in 4p in october in january april july and october the order of planktonic algae density was consistent with that of chlorophyll a concentration indicating that both of these parameters well represented the primary productivity of planktonic algae during the experimental period 3 4 planktonic algae abundance and community structure dynamics in the pond waters the planktonic algae abundance and community structure during the study period are shown in fig 5 a total of 62 species 22 of which were dominant by dominance index weaver 1949 were identified in the five ponds during the experimental period the average number of planktonic algae species was 18 in 1p 22 in 2p 26 in 3p 21 in 4p and 15 in 5p the highest and lowest number of planktonic algae species were identified in 3p and 5p respectively all of the 62 identified species belonged to one of the following cyanophyta chlorophyta bacillariophyta cryptophyta euglenophyta and pyrrophyta among these six phyla chlorophyta and bacillariophyta were the most abundant and dominated the planktonic algae community in the five ponds during the experimental period while cryptophyta was the less abundant fig 5 in 1p the planktonic algae community was dominated by bacillariophyta in winter and all of the six classes of planktonic algae occurred in this season during spring the abundances of cyanophyta chlorophyta and bacillariophyta decreased while those of cryptophyta euglenophyta and pyrrophyta increased nevertheless bacillariophyta continued to dominate the planktonic algae community throughout the season during summer the abundance of chlorophyta increased while that of bacillariophyta decreased and chlorophyta dominated the planktonic algae community in autumn cryptophyta disappeared while bacillariophyta dominated the planktonic algae community in 2p the planktonic algae community was dominated by chlorophyta in winter and summer in spring however the abundance of bacillariophyta exceeded that of chlorophyta moreover the community was dominated by both bacillariophyta and chlorophyta in autumn relative abundance 40 in both cases while cryptophyta did not occur in 3p the planktonic algae community was dominated by bacillariophyta in spring summer and autumn however chlorophyta exceeded bacillariophyta in winter in 4p the phytoplankton community was dominated by chlorophyta in summer and winter while bacillariophyta exceeded chlorophyta in autumn in spring bacillariophyta and chlorophyta dominated the community together relative abundance 30 in both cases in 5p cyanophyta did not occur during summer while cryptophyta never occurred during the experimental period table 1 shows the spatiotemporal dynamics of the dominant planktonic algae species succession in the five ponds a total of 22 dominant species were identified moreover the dominant species in each pond showed a significant seasonal succession table 1 cyclotella meneghiniana fragilaria capucina synedra acus kützing trachelomonas granulosa pandorina morum and aphanocapsa delicatissima occurred mainly in january and april while microcystis aeruginosa pseudoanabaena sp and some other dominant species occurred mainly in july and november however navicula simplex was distributed in all ponds during the whole year in addition although some species dominated the planktonic algae communities in the five ponds their cell number varied considerably among such ponds for example cyclotella meneghiniana trachelomonas granulosa and ceratium hirundinella showed lower cell numbers in 1p 2p and 3p but higher cell numbers in 4p and 5p meanwhile navicula simplex microcystis aeruginosa cymbella pusilla chlorella vulgaris and some other dominant species showed higher cell numbers in 1p 2p and 3p but lower cell numbers in 4p and 5p 4 discussion 4 1 effects of land use patterns on the springwaters hydrochemical features land use patterns can affect the soil and groundwater hydrochemical parameters via plant and microbial activities mganga et al 2016 zhao et al 2010 zeng et al 2017 in spring the hydrochemical parameters i e ph ec hco3 no3 and po4 3 of the springwaters varied considerably under different land uses fig 2 these differences indicate that land use patterns have an important impact on karst hydrochemistry a previous study zeng et al 2017 has shown the occurrence of significant differences in soil co2 under different land uses after rainfall soil co2 dissolves into soil water in the form of h2co3 the water reacts with the carbonate rock creating groundwater with high dic including co2 aq hco3 and co3 2 liu and dreybrodt 2015 the springs under grass and shrub land conditions and with the highest vegetation coverage i e 4s and 5s showed the lowest ph as well as the highest ec and hco3 values fig 2b 2c and 2d meanwhile the springs under bare rock and bare soil land conditions and without vegetation coverage i e 1s and 2s showed the highest ph as well as the lowest ec and hco3 values fig 2b 2c and 2d the spring under cultivated land conditions i e 3s changed similarly to the springs under shrub and grass land conditions during the growth period and to those under bare rock and bare soil land conditions during the dormant period fig 2b 2c and 2d these features reflect differences in soil respiration root biomass and soil microbial activity tend to be high under shrub grass and cultivated land conditions jia et al 2010 costa et al 2013 overall these data indicate that land use affects c dynamics in soil and karst underground water over spatial and temporal sequences liu et al 2007 yang et al 2012 zeng et al 2017 fig 6 further shows the effects of different land uses on the hydrochemistry of groundwater and spring water soil co2 was strongly correlated with the concentrations of ca2 dic and co2 aq in both types of water significant differences may exist in the nutrient concentrations of soil and groundwater under different land use patterns xiao et al 2017 fig 2e shows that the concentration of no3 in springs decreased from cultivated to bare soil bare rock grass and shrub lands during the growth period the spring concentration of no3 in shrub and grass lands with high vegetation coverage was significantly lower than that in bare rock bare soil and cultivated lands this may be because the growth of vegetation consumes a large amount of n in the soil xu et al 2012 or caused by the flow system difference for vegetation can change in soil flow patterns a lot the springs under bare rock and bare soil land conditions may have presented higher no3 concentrations due to the atmospheric deposition of n yu et al 2019 the concentrations of no3 in s3 under cultivated land conditions were lower before march during the dry dormant season but increased between april october during the rainy season notably a compound fertilizer was applied in april for corn cultivation with the increase of rainfall in may a large amount of n was leached into the spring li et al 2010 during spring the variation in po4 3 and no3 concentrations showed similar features except under bare rock land conditions in which case the po4 3 concentrations were lower xiao et al 2017 gelaw et al 2015 in summary our research demonstrated a significant impact of agricultural cultivation on nutrient concentrations in groundwater this aspect needs to be considered when evaluating the nutrient supply to surface water ecosystems 4 2 effects of karst spring hydrochemistry on planktonic algae primary productivity as discussed above the hydrochemistry of karst springwaters shows distinct temporal and spatial variations under different land use patterns differences in the hydrochemistry of such waters may affect the primary productivity of planktonic algae in the respective surface waters jiang et al 2014 hayes et al 2015 here we used chlorophyll a and planktonic algae density to characterize the primary productivity balch et al 1992 chowdhury et al 2017 after analyzing the level of chlorophyll a we were able to divide the experimental period into a growth period march october characterized by higher chlorophyll a concentrations and a dormant period november february characterized by lower chlorophyll a concentrations fig 4a fig 7 and fig 8 show the relationship between the hydrochemical parameters of the springwaters and the primary productivity of planktonic algae in the ponds during the dormant e g in january see fig 7 and growth e g in july see fig 8 periods planktonic algae primary productivity i e planktonic algae density appeared more sensitive to co2 aq fig 7a than to no3 fig 7b or po4 3 fig 7c in the dormant period when dic concentrations were low fig 2d however in the growth period planktonic algae primary productivity was highly sensitive to no3 fig 8b and po4 3 fig 8c this may be partly related to the seasonal structural succession of planktonic algae having different adaptabilities under different hydrochemical environments xu et al 2015 our results further show a decrease in cyanophyta and chlorophyta as well as an increase in bacillariophyta from january dormant period to april growth period fig 5 however cyanophyta and chlorophyta increased and bacillariophyta decreased from april to july fig 5 no3 or po4 3 showed stronger significant positive correlations with planktonic algae primary productivity than hco3 and co2 aq fig 7 indicating that cyanophyta and chlorophyta were more adaptable than bacillariophyta to the hydrochemical parameters typically verified during hot summers beman et al 2005 hayes et al 2015 4 3 response of planktonic algae species to changes in c n or p concentrations it has been shown that the primary productivity of planktonic algae can be limited by n p or both of them howarth and marino 2006 schindler et al 2016 tyrrell 1999 some other studies also consider c as an important limiting factor riebesell et al 1993 visser et al 2016 zeng et al 2019 however the above studies have only focused on the total biomass or productivity ignoring any differences in the response of single planktonic algae species to c n and p input to the system riebesell et al 1993 shi et al 2017 here in order to reveal the distinct response mechanisms of planktonic algae species to spatial and temporal differences in c n and p in ponds we analyzed their cells separately in january the correlation between the total number of planktonic algal cells and co2 aq r2 0 42 p 0 42 was higher than that between the total number of planktonic algal cells and no3 r2 0 01 p 0 89 or po4 3 r2 0 17 p 0 48 fig 7 by analyzing the elemental preference of planktonic algal cells we found that cyclotella meneghiniana was sensitive to co2 aq these results support the opinion that this species would clearly respond to changes in co2 aq shi et al 2017 we also found that aphanocapsa delicatissima and trachelomonas granulosa may have a response mechanism to co2 aq similar to that of cyclotella meneghiniana the results shown in fig 7 suggest that synedra acus kützing navicula simplex and pandorina morum were sensitive to the concentration of no3 their cell numbers increased with no3 concentration similarly to what was found by pan and wang 2016 furthermore eudorina elegans euastrum ansutum and pseudoanabaena sp were sensitive to both no3 and po4 3 in january planktonic algal cells seemed to be overall more sensitive to changes in the concentration of co2 aq rather than in no3 and po4 3 however the response of planktonic algae species to c n and p were significantly different in july the total number of planktonic algal cells had a lower correlation with co2 aq r2 0 17 p 0 49 fig 8a than with no3 r2 0 95 p 0 01 fig 8b or po4 3 r2 0 97 p 0 01 fig 8c these results indicated that the growth of planktonic algae is more likely to be limited by n and p during the growing season howarth and marino 2006 schindler et al 2016 fig 8 also shows the cell number of several element sensitive planktonic algae species was one order of magnitude higher in july than in january among the planktonic algae sensitive to co2 aq cyclotella meneghiniana and aphanocapsa delicatissima were replaced by merismopedia tenuissima scenedesmus bijuba and coelastrum sp in july while trachelomonas granulosa continued to occur combining these results with those shown in fig 5 we can infer that cyanophyta and chlorophyta tend to grow and bloom in summer under higher t while bacillariophyta tends to be replaced rojo et al 2000 paerl and huisman 2008 fig 8 shows that the planktonic algae species sensitive to n and p tend coincide since the n and p concentration gradients presented the same trends in all springs during this period as evidenced in fig 2 we found that synedra acus kützing pandorina morum eudorina elegans and pseudoanabaena sp which are sensitive to the concentration of no3 and or po4 3 were replaced by microcystis aeruginosa chlorella vulgaris cymbella pusilla spirogyra communis and cladophora sp during this period while navicula simplex and euastrum ansutum continued to occur this may be due to changes in t and in the ratio of c n and p which result in the succession of planktonic algae sensitive to different elements hayes et al 2015 xu et al 2015 joehnk et al 2008 moreover our study demonstrates that coelastrum sp which belongs to chlorophyta was sensitive to co2 aq as also found by shi et al 2017 therefore from the dormant to the growth period planktonic algae broke out in succession based on their sensitivities to c n and p past eutrophication studies have mainly focused on the succession of planktonic algae species visser et al 2016 skinner et al 2013 the results of our study indicate that the elemental sensitivity of different planktonic algae species should probably be investigated to further clarify the causes of planktonic algae outbreaks to conclude most of the phytoplanktonic algae sensitive to no3 and po4 3 belong to cyanophyta and chlorophyta while most of those sensitive to co2 aq belong to bacillariophyta element stoichiometric ratios have been widely applied to investigate the effects of nutrient limitation on primary productivity in aquatic ecosystems rhee 1978 klausmeier et al 2008 in the present study in order to clarify which element play a key role in the primary productivity of planktonic algae we considered the values of co2 aq tn co2 aq tp and tn tp weight radio in the springwaters in both january and july and examined their correlations to the number of planktonic algal cells in the pond waters fig 9 there is a significant correlation between phytoplankton algae density and co2 aq tp r2 0 43 p 0 05 fig 9b in january indicating that planktonic algae might be more affected by c or p during the low t dormant period however the correlation coefficient of tn tp r2 0 84 p 0 01 fig 9f was significantly higher than those of co2 aq tn r2 0 49 p 0 01 fig 9d and co2 aq tp r2 0 25 p 0 01 fig 9e in july indicating that planktonic algae were mainly limited by n during the high t growth period to further reveal the regulating effects of c n and or p on planktonic algae the number of cells sensitive to co2 aq no3 and po4 3 in each pond were counted and their proportion with respect to the total number of cells were calculated according to the results shown in fig 7 and fig 8 fig 10 shows the concentrations of dic co2 aq no3 and po4 3 in the springwaters and the proportion of cells of element sensitive planktonic algae species in the five ponds under different land uses in january winter fig 10a and july summer fig 10b it was found that the proportion of planktonic algal cells sensitive to dic co2 aq no3 and po4 3 was consistent with their concentration distribution in the five springs in january and july the primary productivity of planktonic algae seems to be regulated not only by n and p but also by c howarth and marino 2006 schindler et al 2016 shi et al 2017 c limitation occurred mainly during the dormant period while n and p limitation were readily observed in the growing season this may be because the number of planktonic algal cells sensitive to n and p during the growing season is much higher than the number of those sensitive to c in this case although c response phenomena occurred the overall performance of planktonic algae would have depended on n and p availability during the growth period we also found that in january under low t the proportion of phytoplanktonic algal cells sensitive to no3 and po4 3 in the ponds accounted for 30 while the proportion of cells sensitive to co2 aq or dic accounted for 62 71 and 30 54 in the ponds under grass and shrub land conditions respectively therefore the proportion of phytoplanktonic algal cells sensitive to other elements possibly si or fe hutchins et al 2001 in the ponds under land use patterns other that grass land was 50 in the growing period the proportion of phytoplanktonic algal cells sensitive to no3 and po4 3 accounted for 90 5 95 3 and 92 4 in the ponds under bare rock bare soil and cultivated land conditions respectively meanwhile their proportion accounted for only 49 6 and 42 8 in the ponds under grass and shrub land conditions respectively the proportion of phytoplanktonic algal cells sensitive to co2 aq and other elements accounted for 50 4 57 2 in the ponds under grass and shrub land conditions respectively furthermore under grass and shrub land conditions the pond waters were all characterized by higher co2 aq and lower no3 and po4 3 these results indicates that the springs hydrochemistry under shrub and grass land conditions compared to that under bare rock bare soil and cultivated land conditions promoted the growth of c or other elements sensitive species in the corresponding surface waters this in turn may have contributed to the alleviation of phytoplanktonic algae outbreaks jiang et al 2014 hayes et al 2015 5 conclusions based on the shawan karst test site we studied the primary productivity and planktonic algae species composition dynamics in karst surface waters under different land use patterns our data indicate that the growth of shrubs and grasses caused a consumption of n and p as well as the production and addition of abundant co2 into the soil this resulted in lower no3 and po4 3 concentrations but also in higher co2 aq in the springwaters meanwhile the consumption of less n and p and lower soil co2 under the bare rock and bare soil land conditions resulted in springs waters with higher no3 and po4 3 concentrations and lower co2 aq cultivated lands were characterized by lower no3 po4 3 and co2 aq values during the dormant period but higher values during the growth period after the plantation of corn the fertilization of the cultivated lands had a long lasting effect on the springs hydrochemical features the relationship between the total number of planktonic algal cells and co2 aq no3 and po4 3 varies with the season this indicates that planktonic algae primary productivity was regulated by seasonal changes in no3 po4 3 and co2 aq which might have been caused by the seasonal succession of phytoplanktonic algae species sensitive to different nutrient elements further analyses showed that the proportion of phytoplanktonic algal cells sensitive to co2 aq dominated by cyclotella meneghiniana in the ponds under grass and shrub land conditions higher than other ponds in the dormant period in the growth period instead the proportion of phytoplanktonic algal cells dominated by microcystis aeruginosa chlorella vulgaris and cladophora sp was mainly sensitive to no3 and po4 3 in the ponds under bare rock bare soil and cultivated land conditions however the proportion sensitive to co2 aq and other elements dominated by trachelomonas granulosa in the ponds under grass and shrub land conditions is higher than other ponds to conclude the springs hydrochemical features under shrub and grass land conditions i e higher co2 aq but lower no3 and po4 3 compared to those under bare rock bare soil and cultivated land conditions promoted the growth of c sensitive species in their corresponding surface waters it is thus predicted thatgroundwaters with relatively high co2 aq and low no3 and po4 3 deriving by natural afforestation in karst areas may help to alleviate eutrophication and increase c sequestration in the corresponding surface waters indicating the importance of land use adjustment in the management of water quality and carbon cycle credit authorship contribution statement qian bao writing original
