8055,study region the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp is the highest plateau in the world and has been recognized as the asia water tower frozen soils in china are mostly distributed on the qtp which is considered as sentinels of global climate change study focus thermo hydrologic th processes in frozen soils are prominent for improving the mechanistic understanding of subsurface hydrology in qtp in this paper an in house developed high resolution cryo hydrogeological model was implemented into an open source massively parallel computational fluid dynamics cfd software numerical simulations were subsequently conducted to improve the understanding of th processes in north and south facing slopes of a valley in the upper reaches of the heihe river basin uhrb on the qtp new hydrological insights for the region the slope aspect has significant impacts on the temperature and moisture distributions in frozen soils in the uhrb on the qtp the south facing slope exhibited earlier thaw than the north facing slope as indicated by the soil temperature soil moisture and total water storage of the south facing slope were both lower than those on the north facing slope demonstrating that the south facing slope was drier in general the south facing slope also had lower amount of ice water storage which again proved that the south facing slope was warmer the proposed model is expected to serve as a powerful tool for studying integrated hydrological processes and frozen soil groundwater interactions in cold regions keywords frozen soil thermo hydrologic processes qinghai tibetan plateau computational fluid dynamics cold region hydrology 1 introduction the hydrologic and energy cycles in cold regions are sensitive to climate change and important in regulating water resources especially in high mountains mcbean et al 2005 woo et al 2008 pepin et al 2015 nitze et al 2018 ipcc 2019 the freeze thaw cycles ftcs that frequently occur in frozen soils strongly influence the thermo hydrologic th processes in cold regions woo 2012 kurylyk et al 2014a walvoord and kurylyk 2016 mckenzie et al 2021 therefore fundamentally understanding and characterizing the complex thermo hydrologic processes in frozen soils is essential and critical for studying cold region hydrology yet challenging due to difficulties in observation burt and mcdonnell 2015 che et al 2019 and modeling painter et al 2011 ireson et al 2013 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 numerical models are efficient in simulating th processes in frozen soils under seasonal and climate changes especially in data scarce regions kurylyk et al 2014b yang and wang 2019 the upper reaches of the heihe river basin uhrb is located in the qilian mountains on the northeastern qinghai tibetan plateau qtp which is characterized by high elevations and a cold climate frozen soil is one of the major cryospheric components in the uhrb gao et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 and has been studied since 1980 s guo and cheng 1983 limited field observations showed that the distribution thickness and temperature of frozen soil are significantly influenced by the local topography especially the slope aspect mainly due to the solar radiation guo and cheng 1983 wang et al 1995 zhou et al 2000 wang et al 2013 2017 although many distributed hydrologic models have been applied for various purposes in the upper reaches of the heihe river basin uhrb such as web dhm wang et al 2010 crhm zhou et al 2014 gbehm yang et al 2015 gao et al 2016 2018 vic he et al 2015 hydrosib2 sf wang et al 2017 cbhm chen et al 2018 dhsvm zhao et al 2019 the spatial resolution of these distributed hydrologic models is quite low at the kilometer level so they cannot be used to investigate smaller scale processes yang et al 2021 in addition only few numerical studies considered the slope aspect in the uhrb for example to evaluate the influences of slope self shading and topographic shadows on the thermal and hydrological processes zhang et al 2018 incorporated a topographic solar radiation algorithm into a distributed hydrological model shawdhm and performed simultaneous simulations of the th processes in the babao river basin located in the qilian mountains results indicated that topographic shadows have significant effects on the th processes especially in areas with rugged terrain and severe shading although such studies have brought the attention of topographic effects on cold region hydrologic processes the role of surface microtopography in regulating flow direction and water storage was still neglected due to the relatively coarse resolution i e 1 km used in most distributed and land surface models liljedahl et al 2012 jan et al 2018 smaller scale i e hillslope scale and high resolutions simulations are needed to investigate the local topographic impacts on th processes which creating additional modeling challenges painter et al 2013 jan et al 2020 over the past decade a new class of hydrogeologic models grenier et al 2018 named as cryohydrogeology models have emerged e g sutra or modified sutra sutra ice mckenzie et al 2007 mckenzie and voss 2013 feflow dhi 2016 pflotran ice karra et al 2014 smoker molson and frind 2019 comsol www comsol com comsol multiphysics zhang et al 2016 marsflo painter 2011 painter and karra 2014 the freeze thaw module of hydrus 1d software zhao et al 2016 cao et al 2021 and permafoam orgogozo et al 2019 most of the above mentioned models have been validated by benchmark cases grenier et al 2018 and started to be utilized in field applications at hillslope scale ge et al 2011 wellman et al 2013 sjöberg et al 2016 evans and ge 2017 jafarov et al 2018 lamontagne hallé et al 2018 dagenais et al 2020 hamm and frampton 2021 however such models still have great potentials in model developments and solving realistic problems lamontagne hallé et al 2020 in addition most models are not open access which hinders further development and applications of such models in another word one cannot easily tune or utilize those models in a friendly and robust environment in particular few studies combined field observation with a cryohydrogeology modeling approach to explore the effect of steep topography on soil temperature and moisture in mountaineous environments huang et al 2020 used feflow to study soil temperature evolution with daily time step at the south facing and north facing slopes in suprapermafrost region this study was conducted in a river valley in the fenghuoshan watershed central region of the qtp and emphasizing the importance of land surface temperature differences caused by different slope in shallow groundwater systems to understand the effect of steep topography on soil temperature over short distances in mountain environments rush et al 2021 coupled a surface energy balance model with solar radiation and snowpack processes to an existing subsurface model pflotran ice the coupled model with hourly time step was then used to reproduce strong aspect controlled differences in soil temperature and snow depth during water years 2013 2016 from gordon gulch a seasonally snow covered montane catchment in the colorado front range in the boulder creek critical zone observatory orgogozo et al 2019 simulated the thermo hydrological dynamics of permafrost at different slopes in an experimental watershed in central sibera and highlighted a strong sensitivity to variability in rooting depth and corresponding evapotranspiration at slopes of different aspect in the catchment although the time step can be adapted from microsecond to hour only monthly averaged results in shallow soils 10 20 cm were compared and analyzed in summary it is still essential to develop fine resolution models and perform numerical simulations at hillslope scale to improve the fundamental understanding of the slope effects on th processes in frozen soils especially under highly contrasted th conditions along different slopes in the uhrb in the current study we aim to 1 develop a physically based massively parallel and fine resolution cryo hydrogeological model for simulating flow and heat transfer in porous media under ftcs 2 apply the proposed model to further understand the dynamic change of the th processes i e soil temperature liquid water and ice content in frozen soils and 3 diagnose the impact of the slope and aspect on cold region soil hydrologic and thermal conditions in the uhrb the paper is structured as follows descriptions of the current model are given in section 2 including governing equations numerical methods and solver in section 3 the study area and data are introduced in detail mainly including site descriptions and meteorological data model setups such as geometry of the computational domain initial and boundary conditions are illustrated in section 4 results and discussions are presented in section 5 followed by conclusions given in section 6 2 numerical model this paper proposed and utilized a computational fluid dynamics cfd based cryo hydrogeological model darcythfoam for simulating coupled thermo hydrologic th processes in frozen soils under ftcs the model coupled the ground water flow and heat transfer equations as well as a soil freezing curve for phase change which is suitable for simulating 1d 2d and 3d problems of the th processes in frozen soils or other porous media under ftcs with adaptive spatio temporal resolutions from mm to km from μs to h surface hydrologic processes in cold regions are simply represented by the top boundary conditions and forcing data such as temperature precipitation evapotranspiration which ignored the physical processes of moisture and energy transport during snowmelt and its impact on the runoff and gw sw interactions on the other hand the current study aims to develop a community based model under the environment of openfoam which is open source and well acknowledged in openfoam the models are programmed in a general way with all the setups such as interface and boundary conditions configured in a rather flexible way therefore the current darcythfoam model can be easily modified to couple new equations i e solute transport surface flow add complex boundary conditions and or new source terms to meet the requirements by more users and applications 2 1 governing equations to simulate th processes in frozen soils a cryo hydrogeological model for simulating multi phase flow and heat transfer with phase change in porous media was developed the governing equations include the mass momentum and energy conservation laws with all the variables and parameters summarized in table 1 the mass conversation equation under variably saturated condition is the pressure head based richards equation richards 1931 orgogozo et al 2014 1 θ h t c h h t k w h z where c h is the capillary capacity defined as 2 c h s if h 0 θ h h if h 0 the right hand side of eq 1 is the divergence of the darcy flux the filtration velocity field is computed by the generalized darcy s law 3 u k w h z instead of using hydraulic conductivity k w relative hydraulic conductivity with respect to saturation k rel h is considered as orgogozo et al 2019 4 k w k s k rel h k r t the ice content θ i in the relative permeability curve k r t is described through the exponential freezing curve grenier et al 2018 hu et

genuchten correlation is adopted as follows van genuchten 1980 8 θ h ε if h 0 θ r ε θ r 1 α h n 1 1 n if h 0 9 k rel h k s if h 0 k s 1 α h n 1 1 n 1 2 1 1 1 α h n 1 1 n n n 1 1 1 n 2 if h 0 the heat transport equation for variably saturated flow is described as 10 c t l θ i t t t λ t t c w u t where c t is equivalent heat capacity of the medium arithmetic mean 11 c t c w θ w c i θ i c s 1 ε c a ε θ w θ i and λ t is equivalent thermal conductivity of the medium geometric mean orgogozo et al 2019 12 λ t λ w θ w λ i θ i λ s 1 ε λ a ε θ w θ i it is noted that in the current study only local thermal equilibrium is taken into account without considering the cryostatic pressure effects the main complexity of heat transfer eq 10 lies in the advection term including the darcy velocity computed in eq 3 and phase change term expressed with latent heat exchange 2 2 numerical methods and solver the current model was implemented into the open source cfd software openfoam version v1712 as a new solver named as the darcythfoam the execution flow chart of the darcythfoam is shown in fig 1 in each time step the water balance eq 1 and velocity field eq 3 are solved first and followed by the thermal equation eq 10 with updated effective properties for soil and water fluxes with picard loops to deal with non linearities in order to find a balance between the accuracy and computational efficiency an automatic adaptive time step strategy is adopted williams and miller 1999 šimůnek et al 2008 weill et al 2009 orgogozo et al 2014 among them t is the time step and t factor is the parameter of time step automatic adjustment n picp and n iterp are the picard iterations and the max picard iterations for solving the pressure respectively e rr p and p ic p are the error and the maximum error for solving the pressure respectively similarly n pict n iterp e rr t p ic t are corresponding variables for solving the temperature in each time step t while the error of solving pressure and temperature e rr p e rr t are both lower than the maximum error p ic p p ic t calculation for next time step will continue otherwise the time step of the solver will be automatically adjusted by t factor and recalculate until meeting the requirements specific features of the darcythfoam are listed in table 2 for solving the algebraic systems we chose the krylov linear solver with a diagonal incomplete cholesky preconditioner dic pcg to solve the pressure head maxwell 2013 and dilu pbicg to solve the temperature euler time scheme was used for time evolution while the linear interpolation schemes were used in space tone 2009 bayraktar et al 2012 the simulations were performed in a workstation or via the tianhe 2a th ivb fep cluster of national supercomputer center in guangzhou china www nscc gz cn 3 study area 3 1 site description this study was conducted in a small valley in the uhrb the second largest inland river basin in the arid semi arid region of northwestern china li et al 2013 the uhrb is a runoff area located in the qilian mountain on the qtp the annual mean temperature relative humidity and wind speed are 2 3 c 53 2 and 1 9 m s 1 respectively and the annual precipitation exceeds 500 mm liu et al 2018 fig 2a the elevation decreases from south to north ranging from approximately 2000 to 5000 m the land use and cover types are diverse mainly including glaciers grasslands alpine meadow and evergreen needle leaved forests including qinghai spruce miscellaneous soil types are spatially distributed and mainly include gelic cambosols ustic isohumosols and orthic aridosols cheng 2009 the climate is sub frigid and semi arid while seasonal frozen soils are widely distributed wang et al 2017 and varied with elevation and subject to strong local modification by natural conditions such as slope aspect vegetation soil moisture and properties and snow cover cao et al 2018 due to the glacial erosion the a rou catchment is a typical v shaped valley with an elevation from 3033 to 3536 m fig 2c to accurately describe the freeze thaw processes a frozen soil observatory was established at the a rou superstation in the valley including the a rou superstation at the bottom of the valley and two automatic meteorological stations in the north and south facing slopes during the intensive observation period iop 2013 2014 che et al 2019 fig 2b d 3 2 in situ observation the observed data at each automatic meteorological station include air temperature and humidity and respectively wind speed m s wind direction air pressure hpa precipitation mm four component radiation w m2 infrared temperature photosynthetically active radiation μmol s m2 average soil temperature soil heat flux w m2 soil temperature soil moisture volumetric liquid water content and soil thermal conductivity w m k only data used in the current were summarized in table 3 at two standard automatic meteorological stations soil temperature was observed at 8 depths 0 4 10 20 40 80 120 160 cm while soil moisture was observed at 7 depths 4 10 20 40 80 120 160 cm at the a rou frozen ground superstation intensive measurements of soil

probe and cs616 water content reflectometer campbell usa it is noted that only temperature within the range of 50 70 c could be measured by the 109 temperature probe and its maximum linearization error is about 0 03 c at 50 c wang et al 2017 when using standard calibration with a bulk electrical conductivity of 0 5 ds m 1 and a bulk density of 1 55 g cm 3 for measuring the volume water content in the range of 0 50 the accuracy of the cs616 probe is 2 5 in addition water potential and thermal conductivity 4 10 20 40 80 and 120 cm were respectively observed at an interval of 30 min using pf meter sensor geoprecision germany and thermal properties sensor tp01 hukseflux delft netherland at the a rou frozen ground superstation the accuracy of water potential and thermal conductivity determination are both given to be 5 as documented in the manual of pf meter and tp01 these variables have been continuously monitored with intermittent gaps mostly due to power loss and sensor malfunctions at high altitudes che et al 2019 more details of the frozen soil observation and the associated datasets can be found in che et al 2019 3 3 other data the parameters of soil hydraulic and thermal properties are important to the modeling the th processes but no direct measurements from specific experimental conditions or local soil samples are currently available for a rou north facing slope and south facing slope therefore these parameters are usually obtained by empirical or semiempirical functions i e soil hydraulic pedotransfer functions ptfs and soil thermal conductivity models tcms from easily measured and widely published soil properties such as the soil texture bulk density soil organic matter content and fraction of rock fragments dai et al 2019 in particular the soil texture of a rou north and south facing slope table 4 could be easily obtained from the data of digital soil mapping dataset of soil texture in the hrb 2012 2014 in national tibetan plateau data center 10 11888 soil tpdc 270592 the horizontal spatial resolution of the soil texture data set is 100 m and the vertical resolution is unified with 5 soil layers 0 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 60 cm 60 120 cm as there is no corresponding bulk density data for the spatial resolution of 100 m the bulk density data is extracted from a china dataset of soil properties for land surface modeling in national tibetan plateau data center www tpdc ac cn zh hans data 11573187 fd64 47b1 81a6 0c7c224112a0 which is in raster format with a spatial resolution of 30 about 1 km the soil data is divided into

science communities which contains the combination of three commonly used databases of rawls et al 1982 ahuja et al 1989 and unsoda leij et al 1996 nemes et al 2001 hence rosetta3 h3w models soil textural percentages and bulk density as input by zhang and schaap 2017 was used to evaluate the derived saturated soil hydraulic conductivities denoted as k s hereafter and soil water retention ε θ r

each side of the v catchment were then simulated to understand flow and heat transfer processes with different slope aspects using the darcythfoam under variably saturated condition 4 1 geometry of the computational domain freeze thaw processes in seasonal active layers are very sensitive to climate change liu et al 2006 li et al 2012 guo and wang 2014 yang et al 2007 found that the active layer was completely frozen within just one month each year on the qtp which experiences diurnal freeze thaw cycles for two months at 10 cm depth while the diurnal freezing thawing cycles were not obvious at 20 cm depth yang et al 2007 for the a rou superstation there are no measured data for water potential below 120 cm in addition the effective measuring range of the cs616 water content reflectometer is about 4 cm in diameter according to the manufacturer s instruction manual the computation domain of the 2d column is 110 cm in height from 10 cm to 120 cm within the seasonal freezing thawing layer at the a rou superstation and 4 cm in width fig 3 for the v shaped valley the simulated area is generalized into a two dimensional rectangular area that consists of a 90 m long and 1 1 m deep from 10 cm to 120 cm within the seasonal freezing thawing layer at the a rou north facing and south facing station quadrilateral with different tilt angle this allows us to make a simplified representation of v shaped valley by two 2d transects each representing a side of the valley either for the south facing slope fig 4a or for the north facing slope fig 4b the slope angle of the north facing slope and the south facing slope are approximately 4 7 and 3 87 respectively according to the data of srtmslope 90 m digital elevation slope database from geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn 4 2 boundary conditions for both 2d column and 2d slopes the left and right boundary are considered thermally insulated and hydraulically closed the bottom boundary condition is a free drainage condition and a dynamic neumann boundary condition is imposed at the top for the hydraulics groovybc in openfoam the computational domain is set from 10 cm to 120 cm in depth so in situ field observations of soil moisture at 10 cm are used after being converted into the darcy flux in order to improve the computational efficiency the observed soil moisture at 10 cm with 10 min interval is averaged into 30 min intervals for simulations with already considering the effect of rainfall and evapotranspiration subsequently the pressure head is obtained by the darcy s law and used for the top hydraulic boundary condition for the thermal boundary the temperature is equal to the observed temperature at 10 cm in every 30 min at the top of the modeling domain and the bottom boundary condition is zero conductive flux 4 3 initial conditions as mentioned before the data in a rou south facing station a rou north facing station a rou superstation were collected from 2013 8 8 2015 9 9 from 2013 8 8 2014 12 3 since 2012 10 14 respectively the initial time a day in summer when there was no ice in soils was set at 2013 8 24 for the 2d column from the a rou frozen ground superstation and 2013 8 8 for both 2d south facing slope and north facing slope from the a rou south facing station a rou north facing station all the same parameters in each layer used in all simulations are summarized in table 5 the initial pressure head temperature and liquid water content were obtained from field observations for the 2d column from the a rou superstation moreover soil properties such as porosity solid grain density specific heat of solid grain thermal conductivity of solid grain and saturated hydraulic conductivity were obtained from chen et al 2012 the empirical thermal impedance factor ω was set according to the interfrost benchmarking parameterization the fitting parameter w of soil freezing function was derived by fitting to measured values of soil moisture and temperature the van genuchten parameters α and n were determined by fitting from on site soil moisture and water potential water potential were measured at 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 80 cm 120 cm depth using pf meter sensor whose effective measuring range is about 5 cm in diameter according to the manufacturer s instruction manual there were no measured data for water potential at 30 cm so the van genuchten parameters around 30 cm depth were set the same to these fitting parameters around 20 cm depth due to the similarity between two layers in soil moisture and water potential the fitted parameters are presented in table 6 unlike the a rou superstation there are no direct measured soil physical properties and soil potential for both 2d north facing slope and south facing slope soil properties of each layer such as porosity van genuchten parameters α and n saturated hydraulic conductivity and thermal conductivity of solid grain were estimated from rosetta3 h3w and tcm the empirical thermal impedance factor ω was set according to the interfrost benchmarking parameterization the fitting parameter w of soil freezing function was derived by fitting to measured values of soil moisture and temperature all the estimated parameters in each layer used in the simulation are summarized in table 7 4 4 simulation setup for 2d column south facing and north facing slope the maximum number of iterations is set to 20 and the maximum error is 1e 3 in the picard loop of pressure while the maximum number of iterations is set to 50 and the maximum error is 1e 5 in the picard loop of temperature in each time step the convergence criteria for pressure and temperature are both 1e 10 the initial time step is set to 1 s and the maximum time step is set to 30 min the computational domain of 2d column is discretized into 40 110 structured cells and simulations from 2013 8 24 2017 12 31 were run on linux for about 16 5 h cpu time in serial both south facing and north facing slope are discretized into 9000 110 structured cells after grid independence check the simulations were run using 2 core 30 nodes on tianhe 2 supercomputers http www nscc gz cn and cost approximately 2 4 h cpu time from 2013 8 8 2014 12 31 in addition probes that record the temperature liquid water content and ice content at each time step of the computations have been implemented in same depth with the observation nodes and thus they are used for comparison between the numerical results and observations 5 results and discussions 5 1 model evaluation simulating th processes in 2d column from a rou superstation contour plots of the soil temperature and the soil volumetric water content liquid evolution are displayed in fig 5 the spatio temporal distributions show the seasonal freeze thaw processes in frozen soils it is evident that the soil moisture and temperature revolutions are highly correlated the mean soil temperature is 4 16 and more variations are found in shallow soil layers according to the state of the seasonal active layer freezing the th processes can be divided into four phases a thaw initiation period tip b complete thawing period ctp c freeze initiation period fip and d completely frozen period cfp chang et al 2015 huang et al 2020 accordingly the th processes at the a rou superstation from 2013 8 24 2014 12 31 is divided as follows a the tip extends from the onset data of the top thaw to the bottom thaw about 83 days b the fip lasts from the beginning of top frozen to the bottom frozen about 75 days c the ctp is the period of the entire soil in complete thawing about 89 days d the cfp is the entire active layer in frozen about 247 days fig 5 within a year the computed seasonal variations of liquid water and temperature reveal the dynamic phase change between liquid water and ice which also shows that the changes of soil liquid water content are relatively stable in the deep soil layers and having time lags effects compared to those in the shallow soil layers he et al 2015 dai et al 2020 time histories of the temperature and soil moisture at different depths i e 15 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 60 cm 80 cm 120 cm from 24 august 2013 31 december 2017 are presented in fig 6 which evidently show excellent agreements between observed and simulated results the trends of soil moisture and temperature from topsoil to deep soil layers under the ftcs were well captured by the darcythfoam to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the model two statistical indices the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse are employed to compare the measured data with simulated results at the half hourly scale for the soil temperature from 24 august 2013 31 december 2017 fig 6 and the mean annual soil temperature is 4 24 the mae are respectively 0 31 15 cm depth 0 57 20 cm depth 0 73 30 cm depth 0 94 40 cm depth 0 94 60 cm depth 1 06 80 cm depth 1 35 120 cm depth with the rmse between measured and computed values of 0 54 15 cm depth 0 74 20 cm depth 0 96 30 cm depth 1 18 40 cm depth 1 37 60 cm depth 1 77 80 cm depth 2 32 120 cm depth fig 7 the mae and rmse values for each soil depth are much smaller than the amplitude of the annual variations in soil temperature around 30 6 c which provide a quantitative agreement between measured and simulated results again demonstrating that the freezing and thawing processes in frozen soils are well captured by the darcythfoam under variably saturated conditions the slight deviation in temperature comparison may be attributed to the considerable amount of organic matter in the upper soil layer wang et al 2017 and gravel in deep soil layer fig 6 compared with fine soil particle size 2 mm soil mixed with gravel has different thermal properties and further affect soil heat transfer process pan et al 2017 in addition the mae and rmse for soil temperature with increasing soil depth and time are gradually increased which may be caused by error accumulation mentioned in previous numerical studies zhang et al 2016 banimahd and zand parsa 2013 and timlin et al 2002 also pointed out that an error of 2 3 is acceptable given the fact that such complex processes in frozen soils are quite challenging in numerical simulations since the hydrologic and thermal processes are highly coupled the evolution of soil temperature is corresponding to the soil moisture fig 6 although the magnitude of the annual variations in soil moisture is around 43 92 the mae value between field measurements and numerical results are respectively 5 01 15 cm depth 4 78 20 cm depth 5 76 30 cm depth 6 06 40 cm depth 0 92 60 cm depth 1 15 80 cm depth 0 8 120 cm depth while the rmse value is 7 30 15 cm depth 6 77 20 cm depth 7 70 30 cm depth 8 07 40 cm depth 1 22 60 cm depth 1 33 80 cm depth 1 11 120 cm depth fig 7 the mae and rmse for soil moisture at 60 120 cm depth are smaller than that at 15 40 cm depth which may be caused by more frequent and dramatic changes in the shallow soil layers than deep aquifers finally the differences between the observed and simulated soil moisture from april to november are partly due to the effects of ftcs on soil mechanical and physical properties such as specific heat porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity the ftcs accompanied with the frequent soil water phase changes results in the absorption and release of latent heat that has a significant effect on the properties of the soils such as pore size distribution porosity and permeability yang et al 2007 kamei et al 2012 güllü and khudir 2014 aldaood et al 2016 liu et al 2017 xie et al 2015 also collected soil samples from the qtp and found that physical and mechanical properties of the soil were significantly altered through laboratory freezing thawing experiments 5 2 variation in seasonal active layer temperatures and moistures for different slope aspects on the qinghai tibet plateau contour plots of the soil temperature evolution from 2013 8 8 2014 12 31 are displayed in fig 8 while observed and simulated soil temperature at different depths in south facing and north facing slope are shown in figs 9 and 10 by comparing the soil temperatures and moisture from 2013 8 8 2014 12 31 on the south facing and north facing slopes figs 8 9 10 we found that the aspect of a slope has a significant impact on the soil temperature and moisture distribution over an entire ftc the soil temperature at each depth on the south facing slope is generally higher than that of the north facing slope which is consistent with previous studies huang et al 2020 hu et al 2020a 2020b the soil temperature is also higher on south facing slopes than on the north facing slopes up to 6 79 c 6 1 c 5 45 c 2 42 c and 2 57 c at 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 80 cm 120 cm depth respectively figs 9 and 10 from the isotherm of the freezing point temperature 0 c we can visually see the different characteristics of downward thawing and freezing during the tip and fip in the simulation results due to the lower soil temperature in the north facing slope the seasonal active layer of the north facing slope has a longer cfp and shorter ctp than in the south facing slope fig 8 moreover the initial time of tip is earlier in south facing slope than in north facing slope while the initial time of fip is later temperature can affect the permeability eq 4 of the seasonal active layer and the soil freezing function eq 7 so the hydraulic patterns correlate well with the thermal dynamics above the computed seasonal variations of total water liquid water contents at the sampling points in both slopes figs 9 and 10 demonstrated that the south facing slope are dryer and thaw earlier than the north facing slope hu et al 2020a 2020b variations of the hydraulic regimes simulated in north facing slope and south facing slope are closely related to the variation of thermal states between them high resolution i e 30 min in time and 1 cm in space comparison between numerical results and field measurements in both south facing fig 9 and north facing slopes fig 10 demonstrated reasonable agreements in soil temperature and moisture at different soil depths i e 20 cm 40 cm 80 cm 120 cm it is noted that there are considerable discrepancies between simulated and measured results especially in soil moisture possibly due to the uncertainties in the field measurements and model assumptions as known when the temperature is above the freezing point from may to september and the ice begins to thaw absorbing heat causing the temperature to rise slowly similarly when the temperature drops to the freezing point from october to following april the soil moisture freezes to release heat which slows the freeze the effect of depth on these temperatures could also be found that with smaller amplitudes of seasonal variations with increasing depth the simulated soil moisture and temperature showed major shifts compared to the observations in springtime especially at the 80 and 120 cm depths where gravels are the main soil texture yang et al 2013 compared with fine soil grains particle size 2 mm soil mixed with gravels has different thermal properties and further affect soil heat transfer process pan et al 2017 during the summertime ctp the soil liquid water content was still changing which was mostly influenced by the rain fed infiltration that could enhance the downward liquid water and water vapor transport zhang et al 2021 these features are well reproduced by the numerical modeling two statistical indices mae and rmse are employed to compare the measured data with simulated results at the half hourly scale the mae and rmse values for each soil depth between field measurements and numerical results for soil temperature is lower than 2 c table 8 we thus have a satisfactory agreement as this difference is much smaller than the amplitude of the annual variations in soil temperature 26 94 c 20 cm depth 19 40 cm depth 11 48 80 cm depth 7 91 120 cm depth for the south facing slope and 23 44 c 20 cm depth 15 4 40 cm depth 12 17 80 cm depth 8 88 120 cm depth for the north facing slope although the magnitude of the annual variations in soil moisture is around 40 59 for the north facing slope and 55 31 for the south facing slope the mae value between field measurements and numerical results are respectively 7 63 20 cm depth 4 73 40 cm depth 5 38 80 cm depth 10 18 120 cm depth for the south facing slope and 7 81 20 cm depth 8 95 40 cm depth 7 79 80 cm depth 8 33 120 cm depth for the north facing slope while the rmse value is 11 75 20 cm depth 10 59 40 cm depth 5 63 80 cm depth 12 11 120 cm depth for the south facing slope and 9 69 20 cm depth 10 14 40 cm depth 10 38 80 cm depth 10 6 120 cm depth for the north facing slope the associated discrepancies may be due to the estimate of the thermo hydrological properties of the soils with no direct field measurement and no calibration although ptfs and tcms has been widely used in soil science communities they would introduce certain uncertainties in estimating thermo hydrological properties of the soils another possible reason is the differences between the real geomorphology of the slopes and the simplified geometry domains which ignore microtopography slope variability and variability of the thickness and nature of the soil horizons orgogozo et al 2019 moreover the assumption has been made that the horizons are homogeneous in the slopes thus neglecting for example frost cracks and lateral heterogeneities along slopes finally with the increasing depth for both south facing and north facing slope the mae and rmse for soil temperature and moisture are gradually increased which may be caused by numerical bias 5 3 ice liquid water and total water storage tws in north facing and south facing slopes since only liquid water could be measured by the soil moisture sensor cs616 water content reflectometer campbell usa based on the darcythfoam simulations we further calculated the ice liquid water and total water storage tws using the following equation respectively hu et al 2009 xiao et al 2020 14 s phase k 1 n θ phase k d k where k is the number of observed depths phase is the liquid water ice or total water θ w k is the volumetric water content at the k t h soil layer θ i k is the volumetric ice content at the k t h soil layer calculated by eq 6 θ t k is the total water content at the k t h soil layer d k is the covered soil depth of the k t h soil layer s phase is the storage of different phase at calculated soil layer i e ice storage liquid water storage total water storage for the 10 120 cm soil layer in the a rou south facing and north facing slopes from 2013 8 8 2014 12 31 the corresponding soil depths are 5 cm 10 15 cm 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 cm 30 60 cm 30 cm 60 90 cm and 30 cm 90 120 cm respectively the computed ice liquid water and total water storage in both slopes fig 11 demonstrated that the north facing slope has higher amount of liquid ice and total water storage than those in the south facing slope which also agreed with previous studies hu et al 2020a 2020b with the change of ice storage and liquid water storage the dynamic phase change between liquid water and ice could be clearly detected during the entire observational period the reason could be the aspects of the slopes that are under different hydrometeorological conditions such as local solar angle and the intensity of solar radiation received at the slope surface air temperature humidity and evapotranspiration fekedulegn et al 2003 gutiérrez jurado and vivoni 2013 sariyildiz et al 2005 in particular less intense soil radiation has been received in the north facing slope so the north facing slope tends to be colder wetter thaw later and has longer duration of cfp than south facing slope in the northern hemisphere fekedulegn et al 2003 hu et al 2020a 2020b finally current studies and other numerical studies considered the slope aspect are summarized in the table 9 6 conclusions this paper proposed and utilized a computational fluid dynamics cfd based cryo hydrogeological model darcythfoam for simulating coupled thermo hydrologic th processes in frozen soils of the upper reaches of the heihe river basin uhrb on the northeastern qinghai tibet plateau qtp the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 by comparing with 5 year in situ frozen soil observation at uhrb it was demonstrated that the current model darcythfoam is capable of predicting fine resolution th processes under ftcs with both high accuracy and efficiency 2 in order to understand the variability for different slope in a small valley in the uhrb two transects i e south facing slope north facing slope were configured for numerical simulations simulations between south facing and north facing slope reveal the aspect of a slope has significant impact on the soil temperature and moisture distribution in frozen soils the north facing slope is colder wetter thaw later than south facing slope meanwhile the north facing slope has longer freezing duration and more water storage than those in the south facing slope 3 the impact of local topographic factor slope aspect on the soil temperature moisture and total water storage was investigated by at the hillslope scale with high spatio temporal resolutions 1 mm half hour which can advance a mechanistic and predictive understanding of the th processes under ftcs in the uhrb 4 the proposed solver could be further applied and predicted the evolution of water and temperature in frozen soils under various scenarios of climate warming in terms of temperature and precipitation changes further code developments involve coupling the surface processes especially snow and transport processes e g contaminants for studying groundwater permafrost surface water interactions and hydro biogeochemical processes in cold regions in addition compared with the simplified 2d parallelogram geometries a more realistic 3d geometrical description i e a v shaped valley could not only represent both slopes but also consider more impact factors such as microtopography slope variability and variability of the thickness and nature of the soil horizons credit authorship

8055,study region the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp is the highest plateau in the world and has been recognized as the asia water tower frozen soils in china are mostly distributed on the qtp which is considered as sentinels of global climate change study focus thermo hydrologic th processes in frozen soils are prominent for improving the mechanistic understanding of subsurface hydrology in qtp in this paper an in house developed high resolution cryo hydrogeological model was implemented into an open source massively parallel computational fluid dynamics cfd software numerical simulations were subsequently conducted to improve the understanding of th processes in north and south facing slopes of a valley in the upper reaches of the heihe river basin uhrb on the qtp new hydrological insights for the region the slope aspect has significant impacts on the temperature and moisture distributions in frozen soils in the uhrb on the qtp the south facing slope exhibited earlier thaw than the north facing slope as indicated by the soil temperature soil moisture and total water storage of the south facing slope were both lower than those on the north facing slope demonstrating that the south facing slope was drier in general the south facing slope also had lower amount of ice water storage which again proved that the south facing slope was warmer the proposed model is expected to serve as a powerful tool for studying integrated hydrological processes and frozen soil groundwater interactions in cold regions keywords frozen soil thermo hydrologic processes qinghai tibetan plateau computational fluid dynamics cold region hydrology 1 introduction the hydrologic and energy cycles in cold regions are sensitive to climate change and important in regulating water resources especially in high mountains mcbean et al 2005 woo et al 2008 pepin et al 2015 nitze et al 2018 ipcc 2019 the freeze thaw cycles ftcs that frequently occur in frozen soils strongly influence the thermo hydrologic th processes in cold regions woo 2012 kurylyk et al 2014a walvoord and kurylyk 2016 mckenzie et al 2021 therefore fundamentally understanding and characterizing the complex thermo hydrologic processes in frozen soils is essential and critical for studying cold region hydrology yet challenging due to difficulties in observation burt and mcdonnell 2015 che et al 2019 and modeling painter et al 2011 ireson et al 2013 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 numerical models are efficient in simulating th processes in frozen soils under seasonal and climate changes especially in data scarce regions kurylyk et al 2014b yang and wang 2019 the upper reaches of the heihe river basin uhrb is located in the qilian mountains on the northeastern qinghai tibetan plateau qtp which is characterized by high elevations and a cold climate frozen soil is one of the major cryospheric components in the uhrb gao et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 and has been studied since 1980 s guo and cheng 1983 limited field observations showed that the distribution thickness and temperature of frozen soil are significantly influenced by the local topography especially the slope aspect mainly due to the solar radiation guo and cheng 1983 wang et al 1995 zhou et al 2000 wang et al 2013 2017 although many distributed hydrologic models have been applied for various purposes in the upper reaches of the heihe river basin uhrb such as web dhm wang et al 2010 crhm zhou et al 2014 gbehm yang et al 2015 gao et al 2016 2018 vic he et al 2015 hydrosib2 sf wang et al 2017 cbhm chen et al 2018 dhsvm zhao et al 2019 the spatial resolution of these distributed hydrologic models is quite low at the kilometer level so they cannot be used to investigate smaller scale processes yang et al 2021 in addition only few numerical studies considered the slope aspect in the uhrb for example to evaluate the influences of slope self shading and topographic shadows on the thermal and hydrological processes zhang et al 2018 incorporated a topographic solar radiation algorithm into a distributed hydrological model shawdhm and performed simultaneous simulations of the th processes in the babao river basin located in the qilian mountains results indicated that topographic shadows have significant effects on the th processes especially in areas with rugged terrain and severe shading although such studies have brought the attention of topographic effects on cold region hydrologic processes the role of surface microtopography in regulating flow direction and water storage was still neglected due to the relatively coarse resolution i e 1 km used in most distributed and land surface models liljedahl et al 2012 jan et al 2018 smaller scale i e hillslope scale and high resolutions simulations are needed to investigate the local topographic impacts on th processes which creating additional modeling challenges painter et al 2013 jan et al 2020 over the past decade a new class of hydrogeologic models grenier et al 2018 named as cryohydrogeology models have emerged e g sutra or modified sutra sutra ice mckenzie et al 2007 mckenzie and voss 2013 feflow dhi 2016 pflotran ice karra et al 2014 smoker molson and frind 2019 comsol www comsol com comsol multiphysics zhang et al 2016 marsflo painter 2011 painter and karra 2014 the freeze thaw module of hydrus 1d software zhao et al 2016 cao et al 2021 and permafoam orgogozo et al 2019 most of the above mentioned models have been validated by benchmark cases grenier et al 2018 and started to be utilized in field applications at hillslope scale ge et al 2011 wellman et al 2013 sjöberg et al 2016 evans and ge 2017 jafarov et al 2018 lamontagne hallé et al 2018 dagenais et al 2020 hamm and frampton 2021 however such models still have great potentials in model developments and solving realistic problems lamontagne hallé et al 2020 in addition most models are not open access which hinders further development and applications of such models in another word one cannot easily tune or utilize those models in a friendly and robust environment in particular few studies combined field observation with a cryohydrogeology modeling approach to explore the effect of steep topography on soil temperature and moisture in mountaineous environments huang et al 2020 used feflow to study soil temperature evolution with daily time step at the south facing and north facing slopes in suprapermafrost region this study was conducted in a river valley in the fenghuoshan watershed central region of the qtp and emphasizing the importance of land surface temperature differences caused by different slope in shallow groundwater systems to understand the effect of steep topography on soil temperature over short distances in mountain environments rush et al 2021 coupled a surface energy balance model with solar radiation and snowpack processes to an existing subsurface model pflotran ice the coupled model with hourly time step was then used to reproduce strong aspect controlled differences in soil temperature and snow depth during water years 2013 2016 from gordon gulch a seasonally snow covered montane catchment in the colorado front range in the boulder creek critical zone observatory orgogozo et al 2019 simulated the thermo hydrological dynamics of permafrost at different slopes in an experimental watershed in central sibera and highlighted a strong sensitivity to variability in rooting depth and corresponding evapotranspiration at slopes of different aspect in the catchment although the time step can be adapted from microsecond to hour only monthly averaged results in shallow soils 10 20 cm were compared and analyzed in summary it is still essential to develop fine resolution models and perform numerical simulations at hillslope scale to improve the fundamental understanding of the slope effects on th processes in frozen soils especially under highly contrasted th conditions along different slopes in the uhrb in the current study we aim to 1 develop a physically based massively parallel and fine resolution cryo hydrogeological model for simulating flow and heat transfer in porous media under ftcs 2 apply the proposed model to further understand the dynamic change of the th processes i e soil temperature liquid water and ice content in frozen soils and 3 diagnose the impact of the slope and aspect on cold region soil hydrologic and thermal conditions in the uhrb the paper is structured as follows descriptions of the current model are given in section 2 including governing equations numerical methods and solver in section 3 the study area and data are introduced in detail mainly including site descriptions and meteorological data model setups such as geometry of the computational domain initial and boundary conditions are illustrated in section 4 results and discussions are presented in section 5 followed by conclusions given in section 6 2 numerical model this paper proposed and utilized a computational fluid dynamics cfd based cryo hydrogeological model darcythfoam for simulating coupled thermo hydrologic th processes in frozen soils under ftcs the model coupled the ground water flow and heat transfer equations as well as a soil freezing curve for phase change which is suitable for simulating 1d 2d and 3d problems of the th processes in frozen soils or other porous media under ftcs with adaptive spatio temporal resolutions from mm to km from μs to h surface hydrologic processes in cold regions are simply represented by the top boundary conditions and forcing data such as temperature precipitation evapotranspiration which ignored the physical processes of moisture and energy transport during snowmelt and its impact on the runoff and gw sw interactions on the other hand the current study aims to develop a community based model under the environment of openfoam which is open source and well acknowledged in openfoam the models are programmed in a general way with all the setups such as interface and boundary conditions configured in a rather flexible way therefore the current darcythfoam model can be easily modified to couple new equations i e solute transport surface flow add complex boundary conditions and or new source terms to meet the requirements by more users and applications 2 1 governing equations to simulate th processes in frozen soils a cryo hydrogeological model for simulating multi phase flow and heat transfer with phase change in porous media was developed the governing equations include the mass momentum and energy conservation laws with all the variables and parameters summarized in table 1 the mass conversation equation under variably saturated condition is the pressure head based richards equation richards 1931 orgogozo et al 2014 1 θ h t c h h t k w h z where c h is the capillary capacity defined as 2 c h s if h 0 θ h h if h 0 the right hand side of eq 1 is the divergence of the darcy flux the filtration velocity field is computed by the generalized darcy s law 3 u k w h z instead of using hydraulic conductivity k w relative hydraulic conductivity with respect to saturation k rel h is considered as orgogozo et al 2019 4 k w k s k rel h k r t the ice content θ i in the relative permeability curve k r t is described through the exponential freezing curve grenier et al 2018 hu et

genuchten correlation is adopted as follows van genuchten 1980 8 θ h ε if h 0 θ r ε θ r 1 α h n 1 1 n if h 0 9 k rel h k s if h 0 k s 1 α h n 1 1 n 1 2 1 1 1 α h n 1 1 n n n 1 1 1 n 2 if h 0 the heat

θ w θ i and λ t is equivalent thermal conductivity of the medium geometric mean orgogozo et al 2019 12 λ t λ w θ w λ i θ i λ s 1 ε λ a ε θ w θ i it is noted that in the current study only local thermal equilibrium is taken into account without considering the cryostatic pressure effects the main complexity of heat transfer eq 10 lies in the advection term including the darcy velocity computed in eq 3 and phase change term expressed with latent heat exchange 2 2 numerical methods and solver the current model was implemented into the open source cfd software openfoam version v1712 as a new solver named as the darcythfoam the execution flow chart of the darcythfoam is shown in fig 1 in each time step the water balance eq 1 and velocity field eq 3 are solved first and followed by the thermal equation eq 10 with updated effective properties for soil and water fluxes with picard loops to deal with non linearities in order to find a balance between the accuracy and computational efficiency an automatic adaptive time step strategy is adopted williams and miller 1999 šimůnek et al 2008 weill et al 2009 orgogozo et al 2014 among them t is the time step and t factor is the parameter of time step automatic adjustment n picp and n iterp are the picard iterations and the max picard iterations for solving the pressure respectively e rr p and p ic p are the error and the maximum error for solving the pressure respectively similarly n pict n iterp e rr t p ic t are corresponding variables for solving the temperature in each time step t while the error of solving pressure and temperature e rr p e rr t are both lower than the maximum error p ic p p ic t calculation for next time step will continue otherwise the time step of the solver will be automatically adjusted by t factor and recalculate until meeting the requirements specific features of the darcythfoam are listed in table 2 for solving the algebraic systems we chose the krylov linear solver with a diagonal incomplete cholesky preconditioner dic pcg to solve the pressure head maxwell 2013 and dilu pbicg to solve the temperature euler time scheme was used for time evolution while the linear interpolation schemes were used in space tone 2009 bayraktar et al 2012 the simulations were performed in a workstation or via the tianhe 2a th ivb fep cluster of national supercomputer center in guangzhou china www nscc gz cn 3 study area 3 1 site description this study was conducted in a small valley in the uhrb the second largest inland river basin in the arid semi arid region of northwestern china li et al 2013 the uhrb is a runoff area located in the qilian mountain on the qtp the annual mean temperature relative humidity and wind speed are 2 3 c 53 2 and 1 9 m s 1 respectively and the annual precipitation exceeds 500 mm liu et al 2018 fig 2a the elevation decreases from south to north ranging from approximately 2000 to 5000 m the land use and cover types are diverse mainly including glaciers grasslands alpine meadow and evergreen needle leaved forests including qinghai spruce miscellaneous soil types are spatially distributed and mainly include gelic cambosols ustic isohumosols and orthic aridosols cheng 2009 the climate is sub frigid and semi arid while seasonal frozen soils are widely distributed wang et al 2017 and varied with elevation and subject to strong local modification by natural conditions such as slope aspect vegetation soil moisture and properties and snow cover cao et al 2018 due to the glacial erosion the a rou catchment is a typical v shaped valley with an elevation from 3033 to 3536 m fig 2c to accurately describe the freeze thaw processes a frozen soil observatory was established at the a rou superstation in the valley including the a rou superstation at the bottom of the valley and two automatic meteorological stations in the north and south facing slopes during the intensive observation period iop 2013 2014 che et al 2019 fig 2b d 3 2 in situ observation the observed data at each automatic meteorological station include air temperature and humidity and respectively wind speed m s wind direction air

error is about 0 03 c at 50 c wang et al 2017 when using standard calibration with a bulk electrical conductivity of 0 5 ds m 1 and a bulk density of 1 55 g cm 3 for measuring the volume water content in the range of 0 50 the accuracy of the cs616 probe is 2 5 in addition water potential and thermal conductivity 4 10 20 40 80 and 120 cm were respectively observed at an interval of 30 min using pf meter sensor geoprecision germany and thermal properties sensor tp01 hukseflux delft netherland at the a rou frozen ground superstation the accuracy of water potential and thermal conductivity determination are both given to be 5 as documented in the manual of pf meter and tp01 these variables have been continuously monitored with intermittent gaps mostly due to power loss and sensor malfunctions at high altitudes che et al 2019 more details of the frozen soil observation and the associated datasets can be found in che et al 2019 3 3 other data the parameters of soil hydraulic and thermal properties are important to the modeling the th processes but no direct measurements from specific experimental conditions or local soil samples are currently available for a rou north facing slope and south facing slope therefore these parameters are usually obtained by empirical or semiempirical functions i e soil hydraulic pedotransfer functions ptfs and soil thermal conductivity models tcms from easily measured and widely published soil properties such as the soil texture bulk density soil organic matter content and fraction of rock fragments dai et al 2019 in particular the soil texture of a rou north and south facing slope table 4 could be easily obtained from the data of digital soil mapping dataset of soil texture in the hrb 2012 2014 in national tibetan plateau data

the computational domain freeze thaw processes in seasonal active layers are very sensitive to climate change liu et al 2006 li et al 2012 guo and wang 2014 yang et al 2007 found that the active layer was completely frozen within just one month each year on the qtp which experiences diurnal freeze thaw cycles for two months at 10 cm depth while the diurnal freezing thawing cycles were not obvious at 20 cm depth yang et al 2007 for the a rou superstation there are no measured data for water potential below 120 cm in addition the effective measuring range of the cs616 water content reflectometer is about 4 cm in diameter according to the manufacturer s instruction manual the computation domain of the 2d column is 110 cm in height from 10 cm to 120 cm within the seasonal freezing thawing layer at the a rou superstation and 4 cm in width fig 3 for the v shaped valley the simulated area is generalized into a two dimensional rectangular area that consists of a 90 m long and 1 1 m deep from 10 cm to 120 cm within the seasonal freezing thawing layer at the a rou north facing and south facing station quadrilateral with different tilt angle this allows us to make a simplified representation of v shaped valley by two 2d transects each representing a side of the valley either for the south facing slope fig 4a or for the north facing slope fig 4b the slope angle of the north facing slope and the south facing slope are approximately 4 7 and 3 87 respectively according to the data of srtmslope 90 m digital elevation slope database from geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn 4 2 boundary conditions for both 2d column and 2d slopes the left and right boundary are considered thermally insulated and hydraulically closed the bottom boundary condition is a free drainage condition and a dynamic neumann boundary condition is imposed at the top for the hydraulics groovybc in openfoam the computational domain is set from 10 cm to 120 cm in depth so in situ field observations of soil moisture at 10 cm are used after being converted into the darcy flux in order to improve the computational efficiency the observed soil moisture at 10 cm with 10 min interval is averaged into 30 min intervals for simulations with already considering the effect of rainfall and evapotranspiration subsequently the pressure head is obtained by the darcy s law and used for the top hydraulic boundary condition for the thermal boundary the temperature is equal to the observed temperature at 10 cm in every 30 min at the top of the modeling domain and the bottom boundary condition is zero conductive flux 4 3 initial conditions as mentioned before the data in a rou south facing station a rou north facing station a rou superstation were collected from 2013 8 8 2015 9 9 from 2013 8 8 2014 12 3 since 2012 10 14 respectively the initial time a day in summer when there was no ice in soils was set at 2013 8 24 for the 2d column from the a rou frozen ground superstation and 2013 8 8 for both 2d south facing slope and north facing slope from the a rou south facing station a rou north facing station all the same parameters in each layer used in all simulations are summarized in table 5 the initial pressure head temperature and liquid water content were obtained from field observations for the 2d column from the a rou superstation moreover soil properties such as porosity solid grain density specific heat of solid grain thermal conductivity of solid grain and saturated hydraulic conductivity were obtained from chen et al 2012 the empirical thermal impedance factor ω was set according to the interfrost benchmarking parameterization the fitting parameter w of soil freezing function was derived by fitting to measured values of soil moisture and temperature the van genuchten parameters α and n were determined by fitting from on site soil moisture and water potential water potential were measured at 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 80 cm 120 cm depth using pf meter sensor whose effective measuring range is about 5 cm in diameter according to the manufacturer s instruction manual there were no measured data for water potential at 30 cm so the van genuchten parameters around 30 cm depth were set the same to these fitting parameters around 20 cm depth due to the similarity between two layers in soil moisture and water potential the fitted parameters are presented in table 6 unlike the a rou superstation there are no direct measured soil physical properties and soil potential for both 2d north facing slope and south facing slope soil properties of each layer such as porosity van genuchten parameters α and n saturated hydraulic conductivity and thermal conductivity of solid grain were estimated from rosetta3 h3w and tcm the empirical thermal impedance factor ω was set according to the interfrost benchmarking parameterization the fitting parameter w of soil freezing function was derived by fitting to measured values of soil moisture and temperature all the estimated parameters in each layer used in the simulation are summarized in table 7 4 4 simulation setup for 2d column south facing and north facing slope the maximum number of iterations is set to 20 and the maximum error is 1e 3 in the picard loop of pressure while the maximum number of iterations is set to 50 and the maximum error is 1e 5 in the picard loop of temperature in each time step the convergence criteria for pressure and temperature are both 1e 10 the initial time step is set to 1 s and the maximum time step is set to 30 min the computational domain of 2d column is discretized into 40 110 structured cells and simulations from 2013 8 24 2017 12 31 were run on linux for about 16 5 h cpu time in serial both south facing and north facing slope are discretized into 9000 110 structured cells after grid independence check the simulations were run using 2 core 30 nodes on tianhe 2 supercomputers http www nscc gz cn and cost approximately 2 4 h cpu time from 2013 8 8 2014 12 31 in addition probes that record the temperature liquid water content and ice content at each time step of the computations have been implemented in same depth with the observation nodes and thus they are used for comparison between the numerical results and observations 5 results and discussions 5 1 model evaluation simulating th processes in 2d column from a rou superstation contour plots of the soil temperature and the soil volumetric water content liquid evolution are displayed in fig 5 the spatio temporal distributions show the seasonal freeze thaw processes in frozen soils it is evident that the soil moisture and temperature revolutions are highly correlated the mean soil temperature is 4 16 and more variations are found in shallow soil layers according to the state of the seasonal active layer freezing the th processes can be divided into four phases a thaw initiation period tip b complete thawing period ctp c freeze initiation period fip and d completely frozen period cfp chang et al 2015 huang et al 2020 accordingly the th processes at the a rou superstation from 2013 8 24 2014 12 31 is divided as follows a the tip extends from the onset data of the top thaw to the bottom thaw about 83 days b the fip lasts from the beginning of top frozen to the bottom frozen about 75 days c the ctp is the period of the entire soil in complete thawing about 89 days d the cfp is the entire active layer in frozen about 247 days fig 5 within a year the computed seasonal variations of liquid water and temperature reveal the dynamic phase change between liquid water and ice which also shows that the changes of soil liquid water content are relatively stable in the deep soil layers and having time lags effects compared to those in the shallow soil layers he et al 2015 dai et al 2020 time histories of the temperature and soil moisture at different depths i e 15 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 60 cm 80 cm 120 cm from 24 august 2013 31 december 2017 are presented in fig 6 which evidently show excellent agreements between observed and simulated results the trends of soil moisture and temperature from topsoil to deep soil layers under the ftcs were well captured by the darcythfoam to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the model two statistical indices the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse are employed to compare the measured data with simulated results at the half hourly scale for the soil temperature from 24 august 2013 31 december 2017 fig 6 and the mean annual soil temperature is 4 24 the mae are respectively 0 31 15 cm depth 0 57 20 cm depth 0 73 30 cm depth 0 94 40 cm depth 0 94 60 cm depth 1 06 80 cm depth 1 35 120 cm depth with the rmse between measured and computed values of 0 54 15 cm depth 0 74 20 cm depth 0 96 30 cm depth 1 18 40 cm depth 1 37 60 cm depth 1 77 80 cm depth 2 32 120 cm depth fig 7 the mae and rmse values for each soil depth are much smaller than the amplitude of the annual variations in soil temperature around 30 6 c which provide a quantitative agreement between measured and simulated results again demonstrating that the freezing and thawing processes in frozen soils are well captured by the darcythfoam under variably saturated conditions the slight deviation in temperature comparison may be attributed to the considerable amount of organic matter in the upper soil layer wang et al 2017 and gravel in deep soil layer fig 6 compared with fine soil particle size 2 mm soil mixed with gravel has different thermal properties and further affect soil heat transfer process pan et al 2017 in addition the mae and rmse for soil temperature with increasing soil depth and time are gradually increased which may be caused by error accumulation mentioned in previous numerical studies zhang et al 2016 banimahd and zand parsa 2013 and timlin et al 2002 also pointed out that an error of 2 3 is acceptable given the fact that such complex processes in frozen soils are quite challenging in numerical simulations since the hydrologic and thermal processes are highly coupled the evolution of soil temperature is corresponding to the soil moisture fig 6 although the magnitude of the annual variations in soil moisture is around 43 92 the mae value between field measurements and numerical results are respectively 5 01 15 cm depth 4 78 20 cm depth 5 76 30 cm depth 6 06 40 cm depth 0 92 60 cm depth 1 15 80 cm depth 0 8 120 cm depth while the rmse value is 7 30 15 cm depth 6 77 20 cm depth 7 70 30 cm depth 8 07 40 cm depth 1 22 60 cm depth 1 33 80 cm depth 1 11 120 cm depth fig 7 the mae and rmse for soil moisture at 60 120 cm depth are smaller than that at 15 40 cm depth which may be caused by more frequent and dramatic changes in the shallow soil layers than deep aquifers finally the differences between the observed and simulated soil moisture from april to november are partly due to the effects of ftcs on soil mechanical and physical properties such as specific heat porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity the ftcs accompanied with the frequent soil water phase changes results in the absorption and release of latent heat that has a significant effect on the properties of the soils such as pore size distribution porosity and permeability yang et al 2007 kamei et al 2012 güllü and khudir 2014 aldaood et al 2016 liu et al 2017 xie et al 2015 also collected soil samples from the qtp and found that physical and mechanical properties of the soil were significantly altered through laboratory freezing thawing experiments 5 2 variation in seasonal active layer temperatures and moistures for different slope aspects on the qinghai tibet plateau contour plots of the soil temperature evolution from 2013 8 8 2014 12 31 are displayed in fig 8 while observed and simulated soil temperature at different depths in south facing and north facing slope are shown in figs 9 and 10 by comparing the soil temperatures and moisture from 2013 8 8 2014 12 31 on the south facing and north facing slopes figs 8 9 10 we found that the aspect of a slope has a significant impact on the soil temperature and moisture distribution over an entire ftc the soil temperature at each depth on the south facing slope is generally higher than that of the north facing slope which is consistent with previous studies huang et al 2020 hu et al 2020a 2020b the soil temperature is also higher on south facing slopes than on the north facing slopes up to 6 79 c 6 1 c 5 45 c 2 42 c and 2 57 c at 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 80 cm 120 cm depth respectively figs 9 and 10 from the isotherm of the freezing point temperature 0 c we can visually see the different characteristics of downward thawing and freezing during the tip and fip in the simulation results due to the lower soil temperature in the north facing slope the seasonal active layer of the north facing slope has a longer cfp and shorter ctp than in the south facing slope fig 8 moreover the initial time of tip is earlier in south facing slope than in north facing slope while the initial time of fip is later temperature can affect the permeability eq 4 of the seasonal active layer and the soil freezing function eq 7 so the hydraulic patterns correlate well with the thermal dynamics above the computed seasonal variations of total water liquid water contents at the sampling points in both slopes figs 9 and 10 demonstrated that the south facing slope are dryer and thaw earlier than the north facing slope hu et al 2020a 2020b variations of the hydraulic regimes simulated in north facing slope and south facing slope are closely related to the variation of thermal states between them high resolution i e 30 min in time and 1 cm in space comparison between numerical results and field measurements in both south facing fig 9 and north facing slopes fig 10 demonstrated reasonable agreements in soil temperature and moisture at different soil depths i e 20 cm 40 cm 80 cm 120 cm it is noted that there are considerable discrepancies between simulated and measured results especially in soil moisture possibly due to the uncertainties in the field measurements and model assumptions as known when the temperature is above the freezing point from may to september and the ice begins to thaw absorbing heat causing the temperature to rise slowly similarly when the temperature drops to the freezing point from october to following april the soil moisture freezes to release heat which slows the freeze the effect of depth on these temperatures could also be found that with smaller amplitudes of seasonal variations with increasing depth the simulated soil moisture and temperature showed major shifts compared to the observations in springtime especially at the 80 and 120 cm depths where gravels are the main soil texture yang et al 2013 compared with fine soil grains particle size 2 mm soil mixed with gravels has different thermal properties and further affect soil heat transfer process pan et al 2017 during the summertime ctp the soil liquid water content was still changing which was mostly influenced by the rain fed infiltration that could enhance the downward liquid water and water vapor transport zhang et al 2021 these features are well reproduced by the numerical modeling two statistical indices mae and rmse are employed to compare the measured data with simulated results at the half hourly scale the mae and rmse values for each soil depth between field measurements and numerical results for soil temperature is lower than 2 c table 8 we thus have a satisfactory agreement as this difference is much smaller than the amplitude of the annual variations in soil temperature 26 94 c 20 cm depth 19 40 cm depth 11 48 80 cm depth 7 91 120 cm depth for the south facing slope and 23 44 c 20 cm depth 15 4 40 cm depth 12 17 80 cm depth 8 88 120 cm depth for the north facing slope although the magnitude of the annual variations in soil moisture is around 40 59 for the north facing slope and 55 31 for the south facing slope the mae value between field measurements and numerical results are respectively 7 63 20 cm depth 4 73 40 cm depth 5 38 80 cm depth 10 18 120 cm depth for the south facing slope and 7 81 20 cm depth 8 95 40 cm depth 7 79 80 cm depth 8 33 120 cm depth for the north facing slope while the rmse value is 11 75 20 cm depth 10 59 40 cm depth 5 63 80 cm depth 12 11 120 cm depth for the south facing slope and 9 69 20 cm depth 10 14 40 cm depth 10 38 80 cm depth 10 6 120 cm depth for the north facing slope the associated discrepancies may be due to the estimate of the thermo hydrological properties of the soils with no direct field measurement and no calibration although ptfs and tcms has been widely used in soil science communities they would introduce certain uncertainties in estimating thermo hydrological properties of the soils another possible reason is the differences between the real geomorphology of the slopes and the simplified geometry domains which ignore microtopography slope variability and variability of the thickness and nature of the soil horizons orgogozo et al 2019 moreover the assumption has been made that the horizons are homogeneous in the slopes thus neglecting for example frost cracks and lateral heterogeneities along slopes finally with the increasing depth for both south facing and north facing slope the mae and rmse for soil temperature and moisture are gradually increased which may be caused by numerical bias 5 3 ice liquid water and total water storage tws in north facing and south facing slopes since only liquid water could be measured by the soil moisture sensor cs616 water content reflectometer campbell usa based on the darcythfoam simulations we further calculated the ice liquid water and total water storage tws using the following equation respectively hu et al 2009 xiao et al 2020 14 s phase k 1 n θ phase k d k where k is the number of observed depths phase is the liquid water ice or total water θ w k is the volumetric water content at the k t h soil layer θ i k is the volumetric ice content at the k t h soil layer calculated by eq 6 θ t k is the total water content at the k t h soil layer d k is the covered soil depth of the k t h soil layer s phase is the storage of different phase at calculated soil layer i e ice storage liquid water storage total water storage for the 10 120 cm soil layer in the a rou south facing and north facing slopes from 2013 8 8 2014 12 31 the corresponding soil depths are 5 cm 10 15 cm 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 cm 30 60 cm 30 cm 60 90 cm and 30 cm 90 120 cm respectively the computed ice liquid water and total water storage in both slopes fig 11 demonstrated that the north facing slope has higher amount of liquid ice and total water storage than those in the south facing slope which also agreed with previous studies hu et al 2020a 2020b with the change of ice storage and liquid water storage the dynamic phase change between liquid water and ice could be clearly detected during the entire observational period the reason could be the aspects of the slopes that are under different hydrometeorological conditions such as local solar angle and the intensity of solar radiation received at the slope surface air temperature humidity and evapotranspiration fekedulegn et al 2003 gutiérrez jurado and vivoni 2013 sariyildiz et al 2005 in particular less intense soil radiation has been received in the north facing slope so the north facing slope tends to be colder wetter thaw later and has longer duration of cfp than south facing slope in the northern hemisphere fekedulegn et al 2003 hu et al 2020a 2020b finally current studies and other numerical studies considered the slope aspect are summarized in the table 9 6 conclusions this paper proposed and utilized a computational fluid dynamics cfd based cryo hydrogeological model darcythfoam for simulating coupled thermo hydrologic th processes in frozen soils of the upper reaches of the heihe river basin uhrb on the northeastern qinghai tibet plateau qtp the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 by comparing with 5 year in situ frozen soil observation at uhrb it was demonstrated that the current model darcythfoam is capable of predicting fine resolution th processes under ftcs with both high accuracy and efficiency 2 in order to understand the variability for different slope in a small valley in the uhrb two transects i e south facing slope north facing slope were configured for numerical simulations simulations between south facing and north facing slope reveal the aspect of a slope has significant impact on the soil temperature and moisture distribution in frozen soils the north facing slope is colder wetter thaw later than south facing slope meanwhile the north facing slope has longer freezing duration and more water storage than those in the south facing slope 3 the impact of local topographic factor slope aspect on the soil temperature moisture and total water storage was investigated by at the hillslope scale with high spatio temporal resolutions 1 mm half hour which can advance a mechanistic and predictive understanding of the th processes under ftcs in the uhrb 4 the proposed solver could be further applied and predicted the evolution of water and temperature in frozen soils under various scenarios of climate warming in terms of temperature and precipitation changes further code developments involve coupling the surface processes especially snow and transport processes e g contaminants for studying groundwater permafrost surface water interactions and hydro biogeochemical processes in cold regions in addition compared with the simplified 2d parallelogram geometries a more realistic 3d geometrical description i e a v shaped valley could not only represent both slopes but also consider more impact factors such as microtopography slope variability and variability of the thickness and nature of the soil horizons credit authorship

8056,study region the baltic region estonia latvia lithuania located at the eastern shore of the baltic sea northern europe study focus the spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater drought events over the period 1989 2018 was examined standardized groundwater level index sgi was calculated for six monitoring wells installed into shallow unconfined or semiconfined aquifers evenly distributed across the region a set of meteorological and hydrological drought indices were used to characterize drought events using data from ear 5 reanalysis new hydrological insights four major drought events affecting all six monitoring wells were identified 1992 1994 1996 1997 2002 2004 and 2005 2007 with another episode apparently starting in 2018 meteorological drought indices standardize precipitation index spi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and reconnaissance drought index rdi showed the highest correlation with groundwater drought events the era 5 parametrization of surface and subsurface runoff used to calculate the hydrological indices standardized runoff index sri and standardized sub surface runoff index ssri most likely did not adequately represent the hill slope scale processes affecting the unconfined groundwater dynamics thus indices sri and ssri showed less clear relationship with groundwater drought events different patterns of sgi fluctuations and correlation with other drought indices highlight the importance of localized meteorological land use geomorphological or geological factors in controlling the groundwater response to the atmospheric forcing keywords groundwater level drought groundwater drought drought indices sgi 1 introduction meteorological hazards like thunderstorms and flash floods develop rapidly and occur locally while droughts can evolve and grow in intensity over longer time periods and extend to national and even regional scales droughts are characterized by a decreased natural water availability in the form of precipitation river runoff or groundwater water balance deviations caused by drought are a combination of natural e g climatic conditions subsurface characteristics and human activities mainly water abstraction mishra and singh 2010 because of the high impact on agricultural socio economic activities health and the natural environment drought events commonly result in significant economic loss bloomfield and marchant 2013 espinosa et al 2019 haas and birk 2019 van 2015 xue et al 2019 yet to identify and quantify the losses associated with particular drought events is complicated lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 parente et al 2019 spinoni et al 2019 groundwater supplies surface flows and dependent ecosystems during the early stages of a drought event but it takes considerably more time to replenish as the drought begins to break bloomfield and marchant 2013 brauns et al 2020 haas and birk 2019 schwalm et al 2017 sen 2019 the assessment of groundwater drought distribution and severity is often problematic because of data issues such as temporally irregular and erroneous measurements and the spatially and temporally heterogeneous nature of groundwater drought events bloomfield and marchant 2013 marchant and bloomfield 2018 van 2015 in addition recent studies show that groundwater abstraction affects the occurrence and characteristics of groundwater drought too however the impacts are asymmetric and vary greatly between observation sites guo et al 2021 wendt et al 2020 a wide range of indices for the identification and characterization of drought events has been developed and analysed characterizing meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic dimensions of drought events begueria et al 2014 bloomfield and marchant 2013 del toro guerrero and kretzschmar 2020 halwatura et al 2017 jain et al 2015 mukherjee et al 2018 parente et al 2019 xue et al 2019 while such indicators provide a complex view on the different components of drought their application for the assessment of groundwater drought is associated with challenges caused by several catchment and aquifer related factors the groundwater drought signal tends to be lagged and attenuated from the meteorological drought events due to combined effects of land cover soil properties hydraulic properties of the saturated and unsaturated zones the proximity to major groundwater discharge areas and their characteristics bakker and schaars 2019 bloomfield et al 2015 krogulec 2018 kubicz and bak 2019 laaha et al 2017 marchant and bloomfield 2018 van loon and laaha 2015 also groundwater droughts tend to have a lower areal coverage but higher persistence than meteorological droughts van 2015 a global database of meteorological drought events has been developed and described by spinoni et al 2019 the collection of drought cases has been developed by using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardized precipitation index spi over the period 1951 2016 according to the database major drought events affecting northern europe have been reported in 1959 1960 1975 1976 and 2003 2004 european heatwave 2003 other studies have reported additional severe drought episodes in the beginning of the 21st century such as the summer of 2010 2013 2015 and 2018 and autumn and winters of 2006 and 2007 brauns et al 2020 hanel et al 2018 hansel et al 2019 over the period 1981 2016 there has been a decrease in the number of drought events in northern europe in comparison to the period of 1951 1980 however it is important to note that different studies on meteorological drought trends have presented conflicting results mishra and singh 2010 van 2015 projections of drought frequency and severity in the future suggest an increase in drought events because of increases in potential evapotranspiration due to increasing surface temperatures especially in the spring and summer seasons bloomfield et al 2019 dai 2013 trenberth et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2010 increasing drought frequencies and rising temperatures may lead to longer time required for ecosystems to recover after drought events schwalm et al 2017 at the same time it is important to note that some studies have detected an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events in these seasons and such trends sustain also in future climate change projections this indicates that precipitation in spring and summer seasons in europe may have more extremes on both sides of the distribution by the end of this century hansel et al 2019 spinoni et al 2018 the impacts such changes may impose on groundwater systems are associated with varying magnitudes and timing of groundwater recharge pattern that may be even larger than the projected changes in precipitation regime klove et al 2014 nygren et al 2020 the baltic states may not be perceived as a hotspot regarding the occurrence and impacts associated with drought events studies have shown that this is one of the european regions experiencing occasional severe drought episodes spinoni et al 2015 and groundwater component of drought episodes in this region remains unclear therefore the aim of this study is to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater drought events in the baltic states over the period of 1989 2018 as well as the meteorological and hydrological indicators associated with periods of below normal groundwater level the study focuses on the analysis of long term groundwater level records obtained at six groundwater monitoring sites characterized by shallow unconfined or semiconfined groundwater a set of predefined drought indices was used for the identification and characterization of groundwater meteorological and hydrological drought events and their interactions the study comprises the first attempt of quantitatively identifying the recent groundwater drought episodes and the associations between shallow groundwater and drought conditions at meteorological and hydrological scales for the baltic states 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area fig 1 of the baltic states lies in the north western part of the eurasian continent but at the same time is strongly affected by maritime climate impacts associated with the proximity to the atlantic ocean the area is characterized by a highly variable weather pattern caused by strong cyclonic activity distinct seasonality is characteristic and negative air temperatures and snow accumulation are common in the cold season such climatic characteristics determine variable mechanisms of groundwater drought development two maxima in groundwater recharge are evident a springtime maximum associated with the infiltration of snowmelt water and a period of increased precipitation and low evapotranspiration from september till december as most recharge occurs during the cold season the drought event during this time of the year may affect the occurrence and severity of drought in the fallowing warm season kalvāns et al 2020 nygren et al 2020 the accumulation of snow and frozen soil conditions diminish groundwater recharge and result in decreased wintertime groundwater levels frozen soil conditions in the early snowmelt period might diminish water infiltration thus amplifying groundwater recharge deficiency and enhancing summertime groundwater drought van 2015 geologically the study region overlaps with the baltic artesian basin which is characterised by monoclinal layering of paleozoic and mesozoic sedimentary rocks dipping from north to south the thickness of sedimentary cover ranges from a few hundred meters in north estonia to several kilometers in southwest lithuania lukševičs et al 2012 in the northern and central part of the region paleozoic are exposed at sub quaternary surface while mesozoic and even cenozoic strata are found in the south the quaternary was mostly built up by the action of fennoscandian continental ice sheets lasberg and kalm 2013 and their meltwater glacial diamicton as well as clays sands and gravels of aqua glacial origin in the southwestern part of the territory sediments are deposited in the baltic sea basin the quaternary cover is thin in regions proximal to the glaciation centres in the north western part of the region and thickest in uplands and the marginal zone southern and eastern part gorlach et al 2015 ranging from a few meters to several hundreds of meters in the glacial uplands and glacial marginal zone 2 2 data description groundwater level observations for the time period 1989 2018 were obtained from the estonian environment agency the latvian environment geology and meteorology centre and lithuanian geological survey in total six monitoring wells were selected for the analysis table 1 based on the temporal coverage of observations over the period 1989 2018 comparability of well depths and representation of the varying climatic conditions over the study area mainly shallow unconfined groundwater wells were selected located in the discharge areas of shallow groundwater flow the only exception is rimeikas 9600 well which is installed in the confined aquifer however this well is in the discharge area of a confined aquifer and long term observations show strong hydraulic connection to shallow groundwater groundwater level observations were quality controlled following the methodology of retike et al 2022 for the calculation of hydrometeorological drought indices data obtained from the reanalysis 5 or era 5 were used which is the latest and fifth generation of global atmospheric reanalysis developed by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf in comparison to the predecessor reanalysis era interim era 5 is run at a higher spatial and temporal resolution hourly timesteps 31 km horizontal resolution and 137 vertical levels and uses more novice versions of parameterizations of earth processes such modifications include the improved representation of precipitation incoming solar radiation soil hydrological conductivity and others albergel et al 2018 cerlini et al 2018 hersbach et al 2020 hoffman et al 2019 tall et al 2019 in comparison to the predecessor reanalysis era interim the accuracy of the era 5 dataset in general show better results particularly for the representation of precipitation cerlini et al 2018 met office 2019 nogueira 2020 varga and breuer 2020 xu et al 2019 however biases in specific conditions and areas such as the underestimation of extreme precipitation and convective parametrization remain czernecki et al 2019 jiang et al 2021 taszarek et al 2020 other remaining issues are difficulties in estimating solar radiation in cloudy conditions and at high latitudes north and biases in land surface temperatures associated with the representation of vegetation cover babar et al 2019 johannsen et al 2019 in this study era 5 reanalysis parameters of total precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature at 2 m surface runoff and sub surface runoff were used to calculate meteorological and hydrological drought indices 2 3 calculation of drought indices a set of indices describing the meteorological hydrological and groundwater components of drought events were calculated and analysed standardized precipitation index spi is the most widely used standardized meteorological drought index and the world meteorological organization suggest all national meteorological and hydrological services to use it first to characterize meteorological drought events world meteorological organization wmo wmo 2012 to calculate spi precipitation data mostly are fitted to a gamma probability distribution then transformed into normal distribution in a way that the mean spi value is zero this transformed probability is the value of spi which varies between 2 0 and more for extremely wet conditions to 2 0 and less for extremely dry conditions jain et al 2015 spinoni et al 2019 van 2015 world meteorological organization wmo 2012 according to empirical studies increases in temperature affect drought severity as evaporation and transpiration can consume a significant fraction of rainfall therefore the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei based on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated vicente serrano et al 2010 three suggested methods for the calculation of pet are the penman monteith equation hargreaves equation and thornthwaite equation while the differences between obtained results are negligible begueria et al 2014 2020 and for other indices comprising pet vangelis et al 2013 in this study reference evapotranspiration et 0 which is considered equivalent to pet katerji and rana 2011 mcmahon et al 2013 was used to describe the atmospheric moisture demand et 0 was calculated by applying the hargreaves samani formulation included in r package evapotranspiration v 1 15 guo et al 2020 khandelwal and dhiman 2014 and using gtopo30 digital elevation model for reference elevation usgs 1996 the calculation of spei is similar to the one used for spi only using d or difference between precipitation p and pet for the month i as the input d i p i pet i d values are fitted to a log logistic probability distribution then transformed into normal distribution parente et al 2019 schwalm et al 2017 spinoni et al 2019 vicente serrano et al 2010 another meteorological drought index that integrates pet is the reconnaissance drought index rdi that has been used for the identification and assessment of agricultural droughts tigkas et al 2016 the rdi can be expressed as the initial value normalized rdi and standardized rdi within this study for the assessment of drought severity the standardized rdi rdi st was calculated following the assumption that the initial rdi values a k follow a lognormal distribution the a k was calculated as follows a k 1 j 1 k p ij j 1 k pet ij i 1 to n where p ij and pet ij are precipitation and pet of the j th month of the i th year calculated in a time basis of k months and n is the total number of years available the rdi was calculated for a year beginning with october and ending with september rdi st was computed by fitting a gamma probability density function to the frequency distribution of a k and expressed as follows rdi st k i y k i y k σ ˆ yk where y k is the arithmetic mean of y k and yk is its standard deviation rdi is calculated for predetermined reference periods of 3 6 9 and 12 months which implies its different nature in comparison to other drought indices mohammed and scholz 2017 tsakiris and vangelis 2005 vangelis et al 2013 zarch et al 2015 if precipitation is temporarily stored in the form of snow cover delayed release of melt water to the stream creates a significant difference between meteorological and hydrological drought staudinger et al 2014 therefore hydrological indices were also calculated standardized runoff index sri is a hydrological index calculated similarly to spi by fitting a distribution function to the cumulative monthly surface runoff data pathak and dodamani 2016 studies focusing on the analysis of streamflow drought events have shown that catchments with greater storage capacity e g dominated by porous quaternary sediments present more sustained discharges and respond to climate forcing slower than catchments dominated by denser older rocks therefore the use of indices describing soil storage capacity is essential to adequately assess hydrological drought events haslinger et al 2014 in order to depict soil water availability the standardized sub surface runoff index ssri was calculated it was computed in a similar manner to sri only using sub surface runoff parameter from era 5 reanalysis as input hydrometeorological indices spi spei sri and ssri with various accumulation periods were calculated with r package spei version 1 7 begueria and vicente serrano 2017 rdi index was calculated in drinc software version 1 7 tigkas et al 2015 to represent groundwater drought conditions the standardized groundwater level index sgi was calculated its calculation is based on a similar principle to other standardized indices but using nonparametric transformation instead of distribution fitting detailed description in bloomfield and marchant 2013 kubicz and bak 2019 van 2015 the calculation of sgi requires monthly mean values of groundwater level as input data therefore the calculation of representative and comparable monthly mean values from data series with varying sampling frequency had to be performed for this purpose the impulse response function von asmuth et al 2002 was applied to simulate the groundwater level to be used as an input for sgi calculation firs daily groundwater level simulations were obtained by transfer function noise modelling with impulse response functions using daily precipitation and reference evapotranspiration data as explanatory stresses for groundwater level fluctuations for this purpose and also for the calculation of sgi an open source package pastas version 0 17 0 collenteur et al 2019 for python was used daily meteorological observation data obtained from the e obs dataset version 21 0e cornes et al 2018 as an input from an initial subset of 65 monitoring wells 6 sites with model performance of r 2 no less than 0 6 and adequately simulated extremes were selected for the analysis it is important to note that in case of scarce temporal groundwater data coverage the output of the simulation might overamplify the effect of meteorological stresses and interpretation of sgi should be performed with precaution brakkee et al 2021 in the case of the wells selected for this study the frequency of data varied between bi daily to once every three days on average fig 2 the monthly data coverage was between 81 1 vertinikai 203 and 97 5 rimeikas 9600 with exception of well aaviku 3693 that had only 65 0 the latest data entry for well vertinikai 203 was in the year 2013 therefore the simulation until the year 2018 comes with the uncertainty of trend and the extent of extreme replication in the last 5 years for well aaviku 3693 a decrease in frequency to only once per year was noted from the year 2005 to the year 2015 with the last entry at the end of year 2016 however monthly entries during the year 2019 after the researched timeframe give a clear indication that the trend and general pattern had not significantly changed additional gaps one to three years for selected wells were also present but did not have significant impact on the results all the indices used within this study share similar criteria for drought identification with a drought event occurring with index values decreasing to 1 0 or less table 2 according to these criteria moderate severe and extreme drought events were analysed 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater drought episodes in the baltic states for the initial identification of groundwater drought events in the baltic states the sgi was calculated for each monitoring well fig 2 comprises the monthly variations in the values of sgi displaying the similarities and differences in the occurrence of drought events among the monitoring sites used in this study major drought events affecting all monitoring sites can be identified in 1992 1994 1996 1997 2002 2004 and 2005 2007 these drought events in ne europe have also been identified within other research studies spinoni et al 2019 and the analysis performed by the national hydrometeorological service of latvia states that according to spi values the summer 1992 has been the driest on record in latvia while autumn 2005 the driest on record locally zandersons 2019 the period beginning from 2007 has been associated with increased groundwater levels and thus only mild groundwater drought events have been observed till the end of the period under analysis the exception is the drought event beginning from the middle of 2018 and extending outside the period covered within this study the variations of sgi among the monitoring sites display two predominant patterns high variability in ventspils and aaviku monitoring sites and significantly more sustained patterns in the remaining monitoring sites such a divide could be associated with the impact of local meteorological conditions distinct maritime climatic conditions in ventspils and the impact of the proximity to the gulf of finland and lake peipsi in aaviku in contrast more continental conditions are characteristic for the other monitoring sites analysed within this study alternatively this could be the effect of local geological setting in the aaviku site a carbonate aquifer was monitored in contrast to clastic sediments at other locations carbonate aquifers often have dynamic response to the recharge input and large groundwater level fluctuations due to the development of secondary porosity and permeability bakalowicz 2005 fryar 2021 wells in vertinikai griva and lielupe represents shallow unconfined and sandy aquifers up to 12 m depth while the rimeikas well is deeper and exposing confined devonian sandstones overlain by a glaciogenic loam sediments in addition griva lielupe and ventspils wells are located on floodplains of major rivers thus the river dynamics can have a peculiar imprint on the groundwater levels more generally a wide range of topographic climatic and geological factors can affect the groundwater head response to climatic forcing haaf et al 2020 at this stage we note that the sgi time series for different wells exhibit contrasting patterns but further studies are needed to characterize these patterns and elucidate the underlying reasons 3 2 similarities and differences in the representation of drought events among indices a simple cross correlation was applied for the obtained indices at each groundwater monitoring well in order to make the initial assessment of the performance of the selected drought indices in representing groundwater drought events table 3 comprises the results of pearson correlation between sgi and other drought indices with no lag 0 moderate greater than or equal to 0 5 and strong greater than or equal to 0 7 correlations are highlighted the initial analysis reveals that spi is the index with the highest agreement to groundwater level conditions represented by sgi both spatially and in terms of accumulation periods the strongest correlations have been found for accumulation periods of 3 18 months which is generally in line with findings obtained within other studies on hydrological applications of spi suggesting the use of accumulation periods of 6 and more months for hydrological applications parente et al 2019 world meteorological organization wmo wmo 2012 the relationship between spi and groundwater levels mainly depend on the location of the hydrodynamic system lithological conditions precipitation anomalies and economic exploitation of groundwater resources kubicz and bak 2019 lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 the obtained correlations also show high agreement with spei and rdi indices which in addition to precipitation integrate a measure of atmospheric moisture demand expressed by pet for these indices accumulation periods of 3 12 months show the highest agreement with fluctuations in sgi indices integrating surface and sub surface runoff parameters namely the sri and ssri display lower correlations with sgi this could be due to the insufficient representation of local terrestrial and geological conditions in the era 5 reanalysis parameters for surface and sub surface runoff at 31 km spatial resolution for sri moderate correlations with sgi can be found for accumulation periods of 3 12 months while for ssri for 1 6 months only at 3 observation sites the drought indices analysed within the study are also mutually correlated fig 3 with the strongest correlations between meteorological indices spi spei and rdi at all groundwater monitoring sites recent studies confirm that in conditions with no apparent temporal temperature trends the differences between spi and spei have been found to be comparatively small suggesting that precipitation data should be sufficient for the identification of the conditions characteristic for abnormal water deficit however the effect of the inclusion of pet for calculations is evident in cases where pet differs from the average climatic conditions such as the warming associated with climate change vicente serrano et al 2010 the same is true for the generally minor differences between spi and rdi which however become more apparent within future climate change scenarios as spi suggests an increase in humidity in the baltic area while rdi displays no clear trend the differences between these indices are expected to increase in the future as spi which comprises no atmospheric demand parameters may not be capable to adequately identify future droughts under the conditions of increasing temperatures tsakiris et al 2007 zarch et al 2015 even though atmospheric moisture demand plays an important role in the development of drought conditions the role of evapotranspiration on the development of hydrological drought episodes is still uncertain for instance an analysis based on a long term data series of river discharge in lithuania revealed that the timing of the river low flow periods in the summer season was more affected by precipitation than by temperature kriaučiūniene et al 2007 three out of six examined groundwater monitoring wells ventspils lielupe griva are located within floodplains of regionally important rivers thus at these sites sgi fluctuations most likely reflect the same characteristics as river runoff e g having greater affiliation to precipitation rather than temperature also the remaining wells are located in proximity of surface drainage elements like small streams or ditches explaining the affinity to surface runoff indice sri this seems to be a common positioning of such observation wells in the study region retike et al 2022 the sgi time series from the well rimeikas 9600 shows different characteristics than other wells particularly poor correlation with surface runoff indice sri in contrast to other wells it is deeper table 1 penetrating a semiconfined layer of fine grained glaciogenic sediments thus the rimeikas 9600 well appears to be hydrologically isolated from the surface hydrology network in its neighbourhood despite that similar to other wells the groundwater head in rimeikas 9600 have a short response time to the meteorological forcing spi and spei fig 4 this suggest that the quaternary sediments at this location are pervious probably due to high level of heterogeneity leading to interconnected network of coarse grained interlayers the well depth itself and local presence of impervious sediments do not assure isolation from relatively short term atmospheric fluctuations and meteorological drought propagation into groundwater in fig 4 the results of correlations between sgi and hydrometeorological indices at different time lags are shown for most indices and most monitoring wells there is a 0 1 month time lag between the signal of the hydrometeorological index and the response of sgi thus the results of this study confirm previous findings suggesting that the relationship between meteorological and groundwater drought is not linear due to the delay between the onset of both types of drought events kubicz and bak 2019 however the ssri is delayed by up to 9 months compared to sgi sri and ssri have the least correlation with sgi and longest lag periods as explained before these indices are calculated from surface and subsurface runoff parameters respectively from the era 5 reanalysis data set therefore they have a strong dependence on land surface model parameterization for respective grid cells hersbach et al 2020 the explanations for the observed correlation pattern fig 4 include the predominant land use and sediment composition terrain characteristics hydrological network and particularities of geological setting however we highlight that grid resolution of era 5 is not sufficient to adequately describe the hill slope scale processes affecting the groundwater level dynamics as observed in relatively shallow wells table 4 comprises the mean differences expressed in months with negative red values representing the mean number of months over the whole period under the study when hydrometeorological indices depicted more drought events than sgi and positive blue values the opposite when hydrometeorological indices depicted less drought events than sgi while spi tends to identify more months with severe and extreme drought events than sgi followed by rdi it is the index with the smallest overall deviations from the number of groundwater drought events spei tends to depict significantly more of moderate and severe drought cases while extreme drought events were identified substantially less frequently than sgi while for the monitoring sites covered by this study spei has shown more differences from sgi than other meteorological indices studies carried out in southern europe showed that spei performed better in identification of meteorological drought events than spi assadollahi and nowamooz 2018 lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 mehr and vaheddoost 2020 a similar pattern is characteristic for sri which however also depicts less months with moderate and severe groundwater drought events at accumulation periods of 1 3 months ssri generally depicts more groundwater drought events however shows less difference from the sgi for extreme drought conditions regarding the spatial distribution of drought severity differences the calculated indices are relatively consistent among the groundwater monitoring sites except for the sri and ssri indices which showed more noticeable variability among monitoring sites thus highlighting their sensitivity to local features of the observation sites 3 3 time series analysis of drought events in griva aaviku and rimeikas groundwater monitoring sites to assess the overall performance of hydrometeorological drought indices in representation of groundwater drought conditions the analysis of drought cases at particular groundwater monitoring sites was performed in fig 5 we compare the monthly variation of drought indices from 1989 2018 for the griva 9695 well we chose a 9 month accumulation period that most adequately describes the relationship between sgi and most other indices for this well fig 4 the first short lived and mild groundwater drought event as represented by sgi is evident in 1992 during this event the drought conditions at groundwater level were not sustained while the meteorological spi spei and rdi indices and sri displayed more stable drought conditions the sub surface runoff estimate remained at a neutral state during the particular event according to hydrometeorological indices the next drought event could be identified in 1996 however it was not evident for groundwater conditions represented by sgi due to the use of simulated groundwater level time series that projected higher groundwater level than initial observation data the period between mid 1999 and 2011 has been the richest in drought events over the whole study period when four distinct groundwater drought episodes can be identified see fig 2 the first drought episode began in the middle of 1999 with higher impact on wells with more sustained pattern after this event the groundwater level shortly recovered to normal state before an extreme drought episode beginning from the middle of 2002 and extending for a year long period for both events a high agreement in drought timing and intensity between sgi and hydrometeorological drought indices can be observed however the recovery from the latter more severe drought episode appears to be more rapid for meteorological indices while surface runoff sri groundwater sgi and the whole sub surface runoff ssri recovered more gradually as they are more representative of the drought persistency rad et al 2017 in fact the ssri only shortly reached a neutral phase before the next set of drought events occurred beginning from 2006 and extending to 2010 this first groundwater drought event began with a drought episode of extreme intensity in 2006 and was followed by a moderate to severe drought event beginning from the middle of 2008 which lasted for a period of one year during most of the period moderate to extreme drought conditions sustained at the sub surface level the final section of the period under analysis beginning from 2010 was characterized by more wet and neutral conditions however short lived moderate groundwater drought events could be identified in the beginning of 2012 and 2014 2016 a more extreme drought episode was initiated at the end of the year 2018 and extended outside the time period covered within this study fig 6 represents the monthly variations in drought index values at aaviku 3693 groundwater monitoring well we used a 3 month accumulation period which was shown to have the highest correlations for the particular site for most indices see fig 4 it is possible that the geology of this site a shallow carbonate aquifer where fast groundwater flow along fissures was likely determines high variability in sgi values and thus the identification of outstanding drought events is problematic however the sub surface runoff represented by ssri displays distinct drought periods between 1997 and 1999 2002 2005 and 2006 2009 sgi as well as hydrometeorological indices represent a more varying pattern in drought occurrence however some agreement between indices representing drought events can be identified over the period beginning from 2010 the occurrence of dry and drought conditions at groundwater level has gradually become more frequent and of a greater intensity however such a pattern might be ambiguous and caused by a decrease in groundwater observation data availability since 2005 fig 7 represents the monthly variations in drought index values at rimeikas groundwater monitoring well we used a 6 month accumulation period which was shown to have the highest correlations for the particular site for most indices see fig 4 rimeikas 9600 is the deepest 40 8 m well considered in this study and the only one tapping a confined aquifer nevertheless the groundwater response time to climatic forcing is comparable to other wells the sri and ssri have the least correlation with the sgi if compared to other wells fig 4 visual comparison of the drought index time series fig 7 reveals that in terms of sgi the period after 2008 was relatively wet while other indexes particularly ssri show relatively dry periods in contrast the groundwater drought event in 1992 1994 is hardly identifiable in the ssri time series and much shorter according to other meteorological drought indices summarizing the above analysis of the groundwater dynamics few general conclusions can be drawn different landscape elements including subsurface geology surrounding the observation well contribute to the groundwater dynamics as observers in the well it can be conceptualized that various landscape elements have their own contribution to the gwl contribution of some landscape elements like groundwater recharge in a sandy plain is almost immediate but other processes like percolation of the infiltration water through thick vadose zone in nearby hills would have a longer time to take effect this will result in a distribution of lag times between meteorological forcing and gwl response combination of various recharge sources with different lag times will result in a prolonged accumulation period this agrees with the concept of the groundwater residence time suckow 2014 that should be reflected by a distribution rather than a single number in all the studied cases the groundwater level has a short response time to the meteorological forcing e g 0 or 1 month but the accumulation period in some cases is rather long up to 12 month fig 4 thus at each case the gwl dynamic is controlled by range of contributions with various lag times starting for very short immediate up to a year or more there are attempts to apply the concept of groundwater catchments similar to surface runoff catchments for explaining the groundwater level dynamics haaf et al 2020 called for research effort for the prediction of the groundwater level dynamic in ungauged locations they explored a range of environmental parameters including geological settings geomorphometric indices climate indices and surface catchment characteristics to identify typical cases of groundwater level dynamics providing a blueprint for similar explorations in locations other than their case study region here we demonstrate that the meteorological forcing as reflected by such indices as spi spei rdi sri and ssri figs 3 and 4 tables 3 and 4 can be an important descriptor of the gwl dynamics in fact the lag and accumulation times for the highest correlations between meteorological and surface water indices and sgi time series can be a potentially useful metrics to summarize behaviour of a complex system 4 conclusions 1 according to the analysis of data obtained from six groundwater monitoring wells four major drought events affecting all study sites can be identified over the period under analysis 1992 1994 1996 1997 2002 2004 and 2005 2007 the period beginning from 2007 has been associated with increased groundwater levels with a major drought event beginning from the middle of 2018 however falling outside the period covered within this study 2 at least two different patterns of the groundwater level fluctuation and corelation to meteorological and hydrological indices were noticed this highlights the importance of highly localized factors operating at regional to hill slope scale such as meteorological land cover geomorphological and geological characteristics that control the groundwater response to the atmospheric forcing this observation stresses out the need for further in depth investigation of local factors when assessing the groundwater drought onset 3 it was found that the meteorological drought indices spi spei and rdi showed the highest correlation with groundwater drought conditions in the examined shallow groundwater wells surface and sub surface runoff indices sri and ssri were less correlated to groundwater drought events perhaps reflecting the very localized nature of geological factors controlling the onset and duration of drought that may not be sufficiently represented by the spatial resolution of the data available from the era 5 reanalysis 4 the results of this study confirm the findings of previous studies suggesting that a delay between the onset of different types of droughts exists for most indices and most monitoring wells there is a 0 1 month time lag between the signal of the hydrometeorological index and the response of sgi however ssri was delayed by up to 9 months compared to sgi 5 hydrometeorological drought indices in general tend to depict more drought events than sgi while spei and sri depict substantially less extreme drought cases than sgi spi followed by rdi is the index with the highest agreement to sgi in terms of sensitivity to drought events 6 corelation analysis between groundwater index sgi and other drought indices proved to be a useful tool to understand local phenomena affecting groundwater drought at the site level but observed patterns are not self explanatory further research is needed to explain the observed corelations for different periods of lags and accumulation when calculating the meteorological indices

8056,study region the baltic region estonia latvia lithuania located at the eastern shore of the baltic sea northern europe study focus the spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater drought events over the period 1989 2018 was examined standardized groundwater level index sgi was calculated for six monitoring wells installed into shallow unconfined or semiconfined aquifers evenly distributed across the region a set of meteorological and hydrological drought indices were used to characterize drought events using data from ear 5 reanalysis new hydrological insights four major drought events affecting all six monitoring wells were identified 1992 1994 1996 1997 2002 2004 and 2005 2007 with another episode apparently starting in 2018 meteorological drought indices standardize precipitation index spi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and reconnaissance drought index rdi showed the highest correlation with groundwater drought events the era 5 parametrization of surface and subsurface runoff used to calculate the hydrological indices standardized runoff index sri and standardized sub surface runoff index ssri most likely did not adequately represent the hill slope scale processes affecting the unconfined groundwater dynamics thus indices sri and ssri showed less clear relationship with groundwater drought events different patterns of sgi fluctuations and correlation with other drought indices highlight the importance of localized meteorological land use geomorphological or geological factors in controlling the groundwater response to the atmospheric forcing keywords groundwater level drought groundwater drought drought indices sgi 1 introduction meteorological hazards like thunderstorms and flash floods develop rapidly and occur locally while droughts can evolve and grow in intensity over longer time periods and extend to national and even regional scales droughts are characterized by a decreased natural water availability in the form of precipitation river runoff or groundwater water balance deviations caused by drought are a combination of natural e g climatic conditions subsurface characteristics and human activities mainly water abstraction mishra and singh 2010 because of the high impact on agricultural socio economic activities health and the natural environment drought events commonly result in significant economic loss bloomfield and marchant 2013 espinosa et al 2019 haas and birk 2019 van 2015 xue et al 2019 yet to identify and quantify the losses associated with particular drought events is complicated lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 parente et al 2019 spinoni et al 2019 groundwater supplies surface flows and dependent ecosystems during the early stages of a drought event but it takes considerably more time to replenish as the drought begins to break bloomfield and marchant 2013 brauns et al 2020 haas and birk 2019 schwalm et al 2017 sen 2019 the assessment of groundwater drought distribution and severity is often problematic because of data issues such as temporally irregular and erroneous measurements and the spatially and temporally heterogeneous nature of groundwater drought events bloomfield and marchant 2013 marchant and bloomfield 2018 van 2015 in addition recent studies show that groundwater abstraction affects the occurrence and characteristics of groundwater drought too however the impacts are asymmetric and vary greatly between observation sites guo et al 2021 wendt et al 2020 a wide range of indices for the identification and characterization of drought events has been developed and analysed characterizing meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic dimensions of drought events begueria et al 2014 bloomfield and marchant 2013 del toro guerrero and kretzschmar 2020 halwatura et al 2017 jain et al 2015 mukherjee et al 2018 parente et al 2019 xue et al 2019 while such indicators provide a complex view on the different components of drought their application for the assessment of groundwater drought is associated with challenges caused by several catchment and aquifer related factors the groundwater drought signal tends to be lagged and attenuated from the meteorological drought events due to combined effects of land cover soil properties hydraulic properties of the saturated and unsaturated zones the proximity to major groundwater discharge areas and their characteristics bakker and schaars 2019 bloomfield et al 2015 krogulec 2018 kubicz and bak 2019 laaha et al 2017 marchant and bloomfield 2018 van loon and laaha 2015 also groundwater droughts tend to have a lower areal coverage but higher persistence than meteorological droughts van 2015 a global database of meteorological drought events has been developed and described by spinoni et al 2019 the collection of drought cases has been developed by using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardized precipitation index spi over the period 1951 2016 according to the database major drought events affecting northern europe have been reported in 1959 1960 1975 1976 and 2003 2004 european heatwave 2003 other studies have reported additional severe drought episodes in the beginning of the 21st century such as the summer of 2010 2013 2015 and 2018 and autumn and winters of 2006 and 2007 brauns et al 2020 hanel et al 2018 hansel et al 2019 over the period 1981 2016 there has been a decrease in the number of drought events in northern europe in comparison to the period of 1951 1980 however it is important to note that different studies on meteorological drought trends have presented conflicting results mishra and singh 2010 van 2015 projections of drought frequency and severity in the future suggest an increase in drought events because of increases in potential evapotranspiration due to increasing surface temperatures especially in the spring and summer seasons bloomfield et al 2019 dai 2013 trenberth et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2010 increasing drought frequencies and rising temperatures may lead to longer time required for ecosystems to recover after drought events schwalm et al 2017 at the same time it is important to note that some studies have detected an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events in these seasons and such trends sustain also in future climate change projections this indicates that precipitation in spring and summer seasons in europe may have more extremes on both sides of the distribution by the end of this century hansel et al 2019 spinoni et al 2018 the impacts such changes may impose on groundwater systems are associated with varying magnitudes and timing of groundwater recharge pattern that may be even larger than the projected changes in precipitation regime klove et al 2014 nygren et al 2020 the baltic states may not be perceived as a hotspot regarding the occurrence and impacts associated with drought events studies have shown that this is one of the european regions experiencing occasional severe drought episodes spinoni et al 2015 and groundwater component of drought episodes in this region remains unclear therefore the aim of this study is to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater drought events in the baltic states over the period of 1989 2018 as well as the meteorological and hydrological indicators associated with periods of below normal groundwater level the study focuses on the analysis of long term groundwater level records obtained at six groundwater monitoring sites characterized by shallow unconfined or semiconfined groundwater a set of predefined drought indices was used for the identification and characterization of groundwater meteorological and hydrological drought events and their interactions the study comprises the first attempt of quantitatively identifying the recent groundwater drought episodes and the associations between shallow groundwater and drought conditions at meteorological and hydrological scales for the baltic states 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area fig 1 of the baltic states lies in the north western part of the eurasian continent but at the same time is strongly affected by maritime climate impacts associated with the proximity to the atlantic ocean the area is characterized by a highly variable weather pattern caused by strong cyclonic activity distinct seasonality is characteristic and negative air temperatures and snow accumulation are common in the cold season such climatic characteristics determine variable mechanisms of groundwater drought development two maxima in groundwater recharge are evident a springtime maximum associated with the infiltration of snowmelt water and a period of increased precipitation and low evapotranspiration from september till december as most recharge occurs during the cold season the drought event during this time of the year may affect the occurrence and severity of drought in the fallowing warm season kalvāns et al 2020 nygren et al 2020 the accumulation of snow and frozen soil conditions diminish groundwater recharge and result in decreased wintertime groundwater levels frozen soil conditions in the early snowmelt period might diminish water infiltration thus amplifying groundwater recharge deficiency and enhancing summertime groundwater drought van 2015 geologically the study region overlaps with the baltic artesian basin which is characterised by monoclinal layering of paleozoic and mesozoic sedimentary rocks dipping from north to south the thickness of sedimentary cover ranges from a few hundred meters in north estonia to several kilometers in southwest lithuania lukševičs et al 2012 in the northern and central part of the region paleozoic are exposed at sub quaternary surface while mesozoic and even cenozoic strata are found in the south the quaternary was mostly built up by the action of fennoscandian continental ice sheets lasberg and kalm 2013 and their meltwater glacial diamicton as well as clays sands and gravels of aqua glacial origin in the southwestern part of the territory sediments are deposited in the baltic sea basin the quaternary cover is thin in regions proximal to the glaciation centres in the north western part of the region and thickest in uplands and the marginal zone southern and eastern part gorlach et al 2015 ranging from a few meters to several hundreds of meters in the glacial uplands and glacial marginal zone 2 2 data description groundwater level observations for the time period 1989 2018 were obtained from the estonian environment agency the latvian environment geology and meteorology centre and lithuanian geological survey in total six monitoring wells were selected for the analysis table 1 based on the temporal coverage of observations over the period 1989 2018 comparability of well depths and representation of the varying climatic conditions over the study area mainly shallow unconfined groundwater wells were selected located in the discharge areas of shallow groundwater flow the only exception is rimeikas 9600 well which is installed in the confined aquifer however this well is in the discharge area of a confined aquifer and long term observations show strong hydraulic connection to shallow groundwater groundwater level observations were quality controlled following the methodology of retike et al 2022 for the calculation of hydrometeorological drought indices data obtained from the reanalysis 5 or era 5 were used which is the latest and fifth generation of global atmospheric reanalysis developed by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf in comparison to the predecessor reanalysis era interim era 5 is run at a higher spatial and temporal resolution hourly timesteps 31 km horizontal resolution and 137 vertical levels and uses more novice versions of parameterizations of earth processes such modifications include the improved representation of precipitation incoming solar radiation soil hydrological conductivity and others albergel et al 2018 cerlini et al 2018 hersbach et al 2020 hoffman et al 2019 tall et al 2019 in comparison to the predecessor reanalysis era interim the accuracy of the era 5 dataset in general show better results particularly for the representation of precipitation cerlini et al 2018 met office 2019 nogueira 2020 varga and breuer 2020 xu et al 2019 however biases in specific conditions and areas such as the underestimation of extreme precipitation and convective parametrization remain czernecki et al 2019 jiang et al 2021 taszarek et al 2020 other remaining issues are difficulties in estimating solar radiation in cloudy conditions and at high latitudes north and biases in land surface temperatures associated with the representation of vegetation cover babar et al 2019 johannsen et al 2019 in this study era 5 reanalysis parameters of total precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature at 2 m surface runoff and sub surface runoff were used to calculate meteorological and hydrological drought indices 2 3 calculation of drought indices a set of indices describing the meteorological hydrological and groundwater components of drought events were calculated and analysed standardized precipitation index spi is the most widely used standardized meteorological drought index and the world meteorological organization suggest all national meteorological and hydrological services to use it first to characterize meteorological drought events world meteorological organization wmo wmo 2012 to calculate spi precipitation data mostly are fitted to a gamma probability distribution then transformed into normal distribution in a way that the mean spi value is zero this transformed probability is the value of spi which varies between 2 0 and more for extremely wet conditions to 2 0 and less for extremely dry conditions jain et al 2015 spinoni et al 2019 van 2015 world meteorological organization wmo 2012 according to empirical studies increases in temperature affect drought severity as evaporation and transpiration can consume a significant fraction of rainfall therefore the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei based on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated vicente serrano et al 2010 three suggested methods for the calculation of pet are the penman monteith equation hargreaves equation and thornthwaite equation while the differences between obtained results are negligible begueria et al 2014 2020 and for other indices comprising pet vangelis et al 2013 in this study reference evapotranspiration et 0 which is considered equivalent to pet katerji and rana 2011 mcmahon et al 2013 was used to describe the atmospheric moisture demand et 0 was calculated by applying the hargreaves samani formulation included in r package evapotranspiration v 1 15 guo et al 2020 khandelwal and dhiman 2014 and using gtopo30 digital elevation model for reference elevation usgs 1996 the calculation of spei is similar to the one used for spi only using d or difference between precipitation p and pet for the month i as the input d i p i pet i d values are fitted to a log logistic probability distribution then transformed into normal distribution parente et al 2019 schwalm et al 2017 spinoni et al 2019 vicente serrano et al 2010 another meteorological drought index that integrates pet is the reconnaissance drought index rdi that has been used for the identification and assessment of agricultural droughts tigkas et al 2016 the rdi can be expressed as the initial value normalized rdi and standardized rdi within this study for the assessment of drought severity the standardized rdi rdi st was calculated following the assumption that the initial rdi values a k follow a lognormal distribution the a k was calculated as follows a k 1 j 1 k p ij j 1 k pet ij i 1 to n where p ij and pet ij are precipitation and pet of the j th month of the i th year calculated in a time basis of k months and n is the total number of years available the rdi was calculated for a year beginning with october and ending with september rdi st was computed by fitting a gamma probability density function to the frequency distribution of a k and expressed as follows rdi st k i y k i y k σ ˆ yk where y k is the arithmetic mean of y k and yk is its standard deviation rdi is calculated for predetermined reference periods of 3 6 9 and 12 months which implies its different nature in comparison to other drought indices mohammed and scholz 2017 tsakiris and vangelis 2005 vangelis et al 2013 zarch et al 2015 if precipitation is temporarily stored in the form of snow cover delayed release of melt water to the stream creates a significant difference between meteorological and hydrological drought staudinger et al 2014 therefore hydrological indices were also calculated standardized runoff index sri is a hydrological index calculated similarly to spi by fitting a distribution function to the cumulative monthly surface runoff data pathak and dodamani 2016 studies focusing on the analysis of streamflow drought events have shown that catchments with greater storage capacity e g dominated by porous quaternary sediments present more sustained discharges and respond to climate forcing slower than catchments dominated by denser older rocks therefore the use of indices describing soil storage capacity is essential to adequately assess hydrological drought events haslinger et al 2014 in order to depict soil water availability the standardized sub surface runoff index ssri was calculated it was computed in a similar manner to sri only using sub surface runoff parameter from era 5 reanalysis as input hydrometeorological indices spi spei sri and ssri with various accumulation periods were calculated with r package spei version 1 7 begueria and vicente serrano 2017 rdi index was calculated in drinc software version 1 7 tigkas et al 2015 to represent groundwater drought conditions the standardized groundwater level index sgi was calculated its calculation is based on a similar principle to other standardized indices but using nonparametric transformation instead of distribution fitting detailed description in bloomfield and marchant 2013 kubicz and bak 2019 van 2015 the calculation of sgi requires monthly mean values of groundwater level as input data therefore the calculation of representative and comparable monthly mean values from data series with varying sampling frequency had to be performed for this purpose the impulse response function von asmuth et al 2002 was applied to simulate the groundwater level to be used as an input for sgi calculation firs daily groundwater level simulations were obtained by transfer function noise modelling with impulse response functions using daily precipitation and reference evapotranspiration data as explanatory stresses for groundwater level fluctuations for this purpose and also for the calculation of sgi an open source package pastas version 0 17 0 collenteur et al 2019 for python was used daily meteorological observation data obtained from the e obs dataset version 21 0e cornes et al 2018 as an input from an initial subset of 65 monitoring wells 6 sites with model performance of r 2 no less than 0 6 and adequately simulated extremes were selected for the analysis it is important to note that in case of scarce temporal groundwater data coverage the output of the simulation might overamplify the effect of meteorological stresses and interpretation of sgi should be performed with precaution brakkee et al 2021 in the case of the wells selected for this study the frequency of data varied between bi daily to once every three days on average fig 2 the monthly data coverage was between 81 1 vertinikai 203 and 97 5 rimeikas 9600 with exception of well aaviku 3693 that had only 65 0 the latest data entry for well vertinikai 203 was in the year 2013 therefore the simulation until the year 2018 comes with the uncertainty of trend and the extent of extreme replication in the last 5 years for well aaviku 3693 a decrease in frequency to only once per year was noted from the year 2005 to the year 2015 with the last entry at the end of year 2016 however monthly entries during the year 2019 after the researched timeframe give a clear indication that the trend and general pattern had not significantly changed additional gaps one to three years for selected wells were also present but did not have significant impact on the results all the indices used within this study share similar criteria for drought identification with a drought event occurring with index values decreasing to 1 0 or less table 2 according to these criteria moderate severe and extreme drought events were analysed 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater drought episodes in the baltic states for the initial identification of groundwater drought events in the baltic states the sgi was calculated for each monitoring well fig 2 comprises the monthly variations in the values of sgi displaying the similarities and differences in the occurrence of drought events among the monitoring sites used in this study major drought events affecting all monitoring sites can be identified in 1992 1994 1996 1997 2002 2004 and 2005 2007 these drought events in ne europe have also been identified within other research studies spinoni et al 2019 and the analysis performed by the national hydrometeorological service of latvia states that according to spi values the summer 1992 has been the driest on record in latvia while autumn 2005 the driest on record locally zandersons 2019 the period beginning from 2007 has been associated with increased groundwater levels and thus only mild groundwater drought events have been observed till the end of the period under analysis the exception is the drought event beginning from the middle of 2018 and extending outside the period covered within this study the variations of sgi among the monitoring sites display two predominant patterns high variability in ventspils and aaviku monitoring sites and significantly more sustained patterns in the remaining monitoring sites such a divide could be associated with the impact of local meteorological conditions distinct maritime climatic conditions in ventspils and the impact of the proximity to the gulf of finland and lake peipsi in aaviku in contrast more continental conditions are characteristic for the other monitoring sites analysed within this study alternatively this could be the effect of local geological setting in the aaviku site a carbonate aquifer was monitored in contrast to clastic sediments at other locations carbonate aquifers often have dynamic response to the recharge input and large groundwater level fluctuations due to the development of secondary porosity and permeability bakalowicz 2005 fryar 2021 wells in vertinikai griva and lielupe represents shallow unconfined and sandy aquifers up to 12 m depth while the rimeikas well is deeper and exposing confined devonian sandstones overlain by a glaciogenic loam sediments in addition griva lielupe and ventspils wells are located on floodplains of major rivers thus the river dynamics can have a peculiar imprint on the groundwater levels more generally a wide range of topographic climatic and geological factors can affect the groundwater head response to climatic forcing haaf et al 2020 at this stage we note that the sgi time series for different wells exhibit contrasting patterns but further studies are needed to characterize these patterns and elucidate the underlying reasons 3 2 similarities and differences in the representation of drought events among indices a simple cross correlation was applied for the obtained indices at each groundwater monitoring well in order to make the initial assessment of the performance of the selected drought indices in representing groundwater drought events table 3 comprises the results of pearson correlation between sgi and other drought indices with no lag 0 moderate greater than or equal to 0 5 and strong greater than or equal to 0 7 correlations are highlighted the initial analysis reveals that spi is the index with the highest agreement to groundwater level conditions represented by sgi both spatially and in terms of accumulation periods the strongest correlations have been found for accumulation periods of 3 18 months which is generally in line with findings obtained within other studies on hydrological applications of spi suggesting the use of accumulation periods of 6 and more months for hydrological applications parente et al 2019 world meteorological organization wmo wmo 2012 the relationship between spi and groundwater levels mainly depend on the location of the hydrodynamic system lithological conditions precipitation anomalies and economic exploitation of groundwater resources kubicz and bak 2019 lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 the obtained correlations also show high agreement with spei and rdi indices which in addition to precipitation integrate a measure of atmospheric moisture demand expressed by pet for these indices accumulation periods of 3 12 months show the highest agreement with fluctuations in sgi indices integrating surface and sub surface runoff parameters namely the sri and ssri display lower correlations with sgi this could be due to the insufficient representation of local terrestrial and geological conditions in the era 5 reanalysis parameters for surface and sub surface runoff at 31 km spatial resolution for sri moderate correlations with sgi can be found for accumulation periods of 3 12 months while for ssri for 1 6 months only at 3 observation sites the drought indices analysed within the study are also mutually correlated fig 3 with the strongest correlations between meteorological indices spi spei and rdi at all groundwater monitoring sites recent studies confirm that in conditions with no apparent temporal temperature trends the differences between spi and spei have been found to be comparatively small suggesting that precipitation data should be sufficient for the identification of the conditions characteristic for abnormal water deficit however the effect of the inclusion of pet for calculations is evident in cases where pet differs from the average climatic conditions such as the warming associated with climate change vicente serrano et al 2010 the same is true for the generally minor differences between spi and rdi which however become more apparent within future climate change scenarios as spi suggests an increase in humidity in the baltic area while rdi displays no clear trend the differences between these indices are expected to increase in the future as spi which comprises no atmospheric demand parameters may not be capable to adequately identify future droughts under the conditions of increasing temperatures tsakiris et al 2007 zarch et al 2015 even though atmospheric moisture demand plays an important role in the development of drought conditions the role of evapotranspiration on the development of hydrological drought episodes is still uncertain for instance an analysis based on a long term data series of river discharge in lithuania revealed that the timing of the river low flow periods in the summer season was more affected by precipitation than by temperature kriaučiūniene et al 2007 three out of six examined groundwater monitoring wells ventspils lielupe griva are located within floodplains of regionally important rivers thus at these sites sgi fluctuations most likely reflect the same characteristics as river runoff e g having greater affiliation to precipitation rather than temperature also the remaining wells are located in proximity of surface drainage elements like small streams or ditches explaining the affinity to surface runoff indice sri this seems to be a common positioning of such observation wells in the study region retike et al 2022 the sgi time series from the well rimeikas 9600 shows different characteristics than other wells particularly poor correlation with surface runoff indice sri in contrast to other wells it is deeper table 1 penetrating a semiconfined layer of fine grained glaciogenic sediments thus the rimeikas 9600 well appears to be hydrologically isolated from the surface hydrology network in its neighbourhood despite that similar to other wells the groundwater head in rimeikas 9600 have a short response time to the meteorological forcing spi and spei fig 4 this suggest that the quaternary sediments at this location are pervious probably due to high level of heterogeneity leading to interconnected network of coarse grained interlayers the well depth itself and local presence of impervious sediments do not assure isolation from relatively short term atmospheric fluctuations and meteorological drought propagation into groundwater in fig 4 the results of correlations between sgi and hydrometeorological indices at different time lags are shown for most indices and most monitoring wells there is a 0 1 month time lag between the signal of the hydrometeorological index and the response of sgi thus the results of this study confirm previous findings suggesting that the relationship between meteorological and groundwater drought is not linear due to the delay between the onset of both types of drought events kubicz and bak 2019 however the ssri is delayed by up to 9 months compared to sgi sri and ssri have the least correlation with sgi and longest lag periods as explained before these indices are calculated from surface and subsurface runoff parameters respectively from the era 5 reanalysis data set therefore they have a strong dependence on land surface model parameterization for respective grid cells hersbach et al 2020 the explanations for the observed correlation pattern fig 4 include the predominant land use and sediment composition terrain characteristics hydrological network and particularities of geological setting however we highlight that grid resolution of era 5 is not sufficient to adequately describe the hill slope scale processes affecting the groundwater level dynamics as observed in relatively shallow wells table 4 comprises the mean differences expressed in months with negative red values representing the mean number of months over the whole period under the study when hydrometeorological indices depicted more drought events than sgi and positive blue values the opposite when hydrometeorological indices depicted less drought events than sgi while spi tends to identify more months with severe and extreme drought events than sgi followed by rdi it is the index with the smallest overall deviations from the number of groundwater drought events spei tends to depict significantly more of moderate and severe drought cases while extreme drought events were identified substantially less frequently than sgi while for the monitoring sites covered by this study spei has shown more differences from sgi than other meteorological indices studies carried out in southern europe showed that spei performed better in identification of meteorological drought events than spi assadollahi and nowamooz 2018 lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 mehr and vaheddoost 2020 a similar pattern is characteristic for sri which however also depicts less months with moderate and severe groundwater drought events at accumulation periods of 1 3 months ssri generally depicts more groundwater drought events however shows less difference from the sgi for extreme drought conditions regarding the spatial distribution of drought severity differences the calculated indices are relatively consistent among the groundwater monitoring sites except for the sri and ssri indices which showed more noticeable variability among monitoring sites thus highlighting their sensitivity to local features of the observation sites 3 3 time series analysis of drought events in griva aaviku and rimeikas groundwater monitoring sites to assess the overall performance of hydrometeorological drought indices in representation of groundwater drought conditions the analysis of drought cases at particular groundwater monitoring sites was performed in fig 5 we compare the monthly variation of drought indices from 1989 2018 for the griva 9695 well we chose a 9 month accumulation period that most adequately describes the relationship between sgi and most other indices for this well fig 4 the first short lived and mild groundwater drought event as represented by sgi is evident in 1992 during this event the drought conditions at groundwater level were not sustained while the meteorological spi spei and rdi indices and sri displayed more stable drought conditions the sub surface runoff estimate remained at a neutral state during the particular event according to hydrometeorological indices the next drought event could be identified in 1996 however it was not evident for groundwater conditions represented by sgi due to the use of simulated groundwater level time series that projected higher groundwater level than initial observation data the period between mid 1999 and 2011 has been the richest in drought events over the whole study period when four distinct groundwater drought episodes can be identified see fig 2 the first drought episode began in the middle of 1999 with higher impact on wells with more sustained pattern after this event the groundwater level shortly recovered to normal state before an extreme drought episode beginning from the middle of 2002 and extending for a year long period for both events a high agreement in drought timing and intensity between sgi and hydrometeorological drought indices can be observed however the recovery from the latter more severe drought episode appears to be more rapid for meteorological indices while surface runoff sri groundwater sgi and the whole sub surface runoff ssri recovered more gradually as they are more representative of the drought persistency rad et al 2017 in fact the ssri only shortly reached a neutral phase before the next set of drought events occurred beginning from 2006 and extending to 2010 this first groundwater drought event began with a drought episode of extreme intensity in 2006 and was followed by a moderate to severe drought event beginning from the middle of 2008 which lasted for a period of one year during most of the period moderate to extreme drought conditions sustained at the sub surface level the final section of the period under analysis beginning from 2010 was characterized by more wet and neutral conditions however short lived moderate groundwater drought events could be identified in the beginning of 2012 and 2014 2016 a more extreme drought episode was initiated at the end of the year 2018 and extended outside the time period covered within this study fig 6 represents the monthly variations in drought index values at aaviku 3693 groundwater monitoring well we used a 3 month accumulation period which was shown to have the highest correlations for the particular site for most indices see fig 4 it is possible that the geology of this site a shallow carbonate aquifer where fast groundwater flow along fissures was likely determines high variability in sgi values and thus the identification of outstanding drought events is problematic however the sub surface runoff represented by ssri displays distinct drought periods between 1997 and 1999 2002 2005 and 2006 2009 sgi as well as hydrometeorological indices represent a more varying pattern in drought occurrence however some agreement between indices representing drought events can be identified over the period beginning from 2010 the occurrence of dry and drought conditions at groundwater level has gradually become more frequent and of a greater intensity however such a pattern might be ambiguous and caused by a decrease in groundwater observation data availability since 2005 fig 7 represents the monthly variations in drought index values at rimeikas groundwater monitoring well we used a 6 month accumulation period which was shown to have the highest correlations for the particular site for most indices see fig 4 rimeikas 9600 is the deepest 40 8 m well considered in this study and the only one tapping a confined aquifer nevertheless the groundwater response time to climatic forcing is comparable to other wells the sri and ssri have the least correlation with the sgi if compared to other wells fig 4 visual comparison of the drought index time series fig 7 reveals that in terms of sgi the period after 2008 was relatively wet while other indexes particularly ssri show relatively dry periods in contrast the groundwater drought event in 1992 1994 is hardly identifiable in the ssri time series and much shorter according to other meteorological drought indices summarizing the above analysis of the groundwater dynamics few general conclusions can be drawn different landscape elements including subsurface geology surrounding the observation well contribute to the groundwater dynamics as observers in the well it can be conceptualized that various landscape elements have their own contribution to the gwl contribution of some landscape elements like groundwater recharge in a sandy plain is almost immediate but other processes like percolation of the infiltration water through thick vadose zone in nearby hills would have a longer time to take effect this will result in a distribution of lag times between meteorological forcing and gwl response combination of various recharge sources with different lag times will result in a prolonged accumulation period this agrees with the concept of the groundwater residence time suckow 2014 that should be reflected by a distribution rather than a single number in all the studied cases the groundwater level has a short response time to the meteorological forcing e g 0 or 1 month but the accumulation period in some cases is rather long up to 12 month fig 4 thus at each case the gwl dynamic is controlled by range of contributions with various lag times starting for very short immediate up to a year or more there are attempts to apply the concept of groundwater catchments similar to surface runoff catchments for explaining the groundwater level dynamics haaf et al 2020 called for research effort for the prediction of the groundwater level dynamic in ungauged locations they explored a range of environmental parameters including geological settings geomorphometric indices climate indices and surface catchment characteristics to identify typical cases of groundwater level dynamics providing a blueprint for similar explorations in locations other than their case study region here we demonstrate that the meteorological forcing as reflected by such indices as spi spei rdi sri and ssri figs 3 and 4 tables 3 and 4 can be an important descriptor of the gwl dynamics in fact the lag and accumulation times for the highest correlations between meteorological and surface water indices and sgi time series can be a potentially useful metrics to summarize behaviour of a complex system 4 conclusions 1 according to the analysis of data obtained from six groundwater monitoring wells four major drought events affecting all study sites can be identified over the period under analysis 1992 1994 1996 1997 2002 2004 and 2005 2007 the period beginning from 2007 has been associated with increased groundwater levels with a major drought event beginning from the middle of 2018 however falling outside the period covered within this study 2 at least two different patterns of the groundwater level fluctuation and corelation to meteorological and hydrological indices were noticed this highlights the importance of highly localized factors operating at regional to hill slope scale such as meteorological land cover geomorphological and geological characteristics that control the groundwater response to the atmospheric forcing this observation stresses out the need for further in depth investigation of local factors when assessing the groundwater drought onset 3 it was found that the meteorological drought indices spi spei and rdi showed the highest correlation with groundwater drought conditions in the examined shallow groundwater wells surface and sub surface runoff indices sri and ssri were less correlated to groundwater drought events perhaps reflecting the very localized nature of geological factors controlling the onset and duration of drought that may not be sufficiently represented by the spatial resolution of the data available from the era 5 reanalysis 4 the results of this study confirm the findings of previous studies suggesting that a delay between the onset of different types of droughts exists for most indices and most monitoring wells there is a 0 1 month time lag between the signal of the hydrometeorological index and the response of sgi however ssri was delayed by up to 9 months compared to sgi 5 hydrometeorological drought indices in general tend to depict more drought events than sgi while spei and sri depict substantially less extreme drought cases than sgi spi followed by rdi is the index with the highest agreement to sgi in terms of sensitivity to drought events 6 corelation analysis between groundwater index sgi and other drought indices proved to be a useful tool to understand local phenomena affecting groundwater drought at the site level but observed patterns are not self explanatory further research is needed to explain the observed corelations for different periods of lags and accumulation when calculating the meteorological indices

8057,study region the yangtze poyang river lake system yprls which includes the poyang lake and the middle reach of yangtze river basin study focus the water exchange in the yprls is complex and vital to the dynamic of it thereby requiring well simulation nevertheless existing numerical models have shortages in accuracy efficiency and revealing potential relationships thus for providing an accurate and efficient statistical model as a fundamental tool for investigating the effects of changing environment on the yprls we developed the yangtze poyang water exchange statistic ypwes model in this study the ypwes model was employed to simulate the water exchange in the yprls from 1971 to 2016 and improve our understanding of the backflow from the river to lake brl in the yprls new hydrological insights for the region based on a physic based lumped framework the established ypwes model is basically more accurate and efficient than nine existing models meanwhile 93 of the brl event will occur when the value of discharge identification function dif is 9 2 10 0 m while the threshold range of the dif corresponding to the brl event occurrence was smaller after 2003 because the discharge stage relationship changes with the yangtze river streamflow when the brl event occurs our work provides a valuable model and may help to investigate the cause and influence of the water exchange in the yprls keywords yangtze poyang river lake system water exchange yangtze poyang water exchange statistic model backflow from the river to lake 1 introduction the hydrodynamic processes occurring at the junctions of lakes rivers and seas are affected by many factors with diverse characteristics mainly under the impact from the human activities and climate change wu et al 2021 chen et al 2018 yang et al 2016 yao et al 2014 llebot et al 2014 the complexity and non linear relationships of the water exchange due to multiple influencing factors have been reported across the globe in recent decades luo et al 2020 huang et al 2017 li et al 2017 lawrence et al 2004 this complex non linear and complex relationships are detrimental to gain the patterns of the river lake system s dynamic as well as the to manage of water environment and water ecology in the river lake systems zhang et al 2020 li et al 2019 yang et al 2016 therefore an effective evaluation and quantification of the water exchange in the river lake system is required the poyang lake which is the largest freshwater lake in china and located at the south bank of the middle reaches of the yangtze river is connected to the yangtze river forming the yangtze poyang river lake system yprls the poyang lake predominantly receives surface inflow from the its upstream rivers and subsequently empties into the yangtze river through its north outlet shankman et al 2006 thus the yprls is a typical large scale river lake system within which the hydrological regime fluctuates dramatically between the dry and wet periods of the poyang lake basin jiang et al 2021 li et al 2020 li et al 2019 li et al 2017 yang et al 2016 furthermore several studies have shown that the water exchange in the yprls has changed significantly during the past 20 years which is mainly attributed to the yangtze river streamflow in the mainstream and the catchment inflow of the poyang lake cipl chen et al 2016 gao et al 2013 hu et al 2007 lu et al 2021 su et al 2016 xu et al 2020 yao et al 2018 ye et al 2013 therefore the hydrodynamic process as well as the aquatic ecological health of the yprls have been changed in recent decades chen et al 2019 li et al 2019 yang et al 2016 li et al 2015 zhang and werner 2015 additionally the complexity of the water exchange is mainly presented as the combination of backflow from the river to the lake brl and drainage from the poyang lake into the mainstream of the yangtze river accompanying with a dispersive and hysteretic discharge stage relationship jiang et al 2021 yao et al 2018 li et al 2017 huang et al 2017 zhang and werner 2015 particularly the occurrence of brl event leading to high water level as well as flood event in the poyang lake bing 2018 yang et al 2016 however existing studies of revealing the mechanism and regularity of the brl event s occurrence in the yprls that are available in international magazines are rare as a typical paper li et al 2017 used the ratio of cipl s discharge to yangtze river streamflow as an indication of the daily occurrence of backflow from 1960 to 2010 while 74 of the brl event would occur when this ratio was lower than 5 meanwhile huang et al 2017 reported that measured q h has a good fitting relationship with water level measured at hankou station which is located outside the yprls besides the changing environment especially human activities such as sad mining dam operation and delimit reservoirs would bring new stresses on the water cycle water quality carbon cycle and ecological system in the yprls which is determined by the water exchange in the yprls at a certain or high extent li et al 2019 lu et al 2021 wu et al 2017 yao et al 2019a b therefore an accurate and efficient simulation of the water exchange in the yprls revealing the potential mechanism of the water exchange is needed for this purpose mechanism hydrodynamic models and statistical models are widely used to simulate the discharge and water level at the outlet of the poyang lake hydrodynamic models are based on strong physical mechanisms in general bates et al 2010 gerbeau et al 2001 many of them are employed in studies just considering the effect of hydrodynamic process in the poyang lake on the water exchange in the yprls which is mainly influenced by the wind forcing and underwater topography changes yao et al 2019 yao et al 2018 furthermore hydrodynamic models integrating the hydrodynamic process in the poyang lake and the mainstream of the yangtze river have been employed to simulate the severe flooding and dry events and the effect of the three gorges dam impoundment on the water exchange in the yprls bing 2018 lai et al 2013 lai et al 2012 meanwhile hydrodynamic models are used to reveal the effects of water exchange on the surface hydrological connectivity degree of hysteresis transport trajectory and residence time coupling of the hydrodynamic and hydrological processes and water age in the poyang lake as well huang et al 2021 li et al 2019 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 li and yao 2015 li et al 2015 li et al 2013 nevertheless though the hydrodynamic models are effectively employed the requirements for a variety of data providing initial and underlying surface conditions and discrete generalization networks with a considerable number of grids are detrimental to improve computing efficiency specifically the hydrodynamic models simulating processes in the yprls have more than 20 000 grids resulting in the simulation for every year costs about 6 h yao et al 2019 yao et al 2018 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 to obtain higher accuracies and shorter simulation time of simulations the statistical models have received more attention in recent years several studies have shown that statistical models usually spend several minutes in providing a daily result whilst hydrodynamic models basically spent multi hours in the same simulating guo and lai 2020 ye et al 2017 li et al 2015 li et al 2013 with respect to the adaptation of statistical models in the yprls the back propagation neural networks bpnns are applied to simulate the water level variations and water level decline in the poyang lake ye et al 2017 li et al 2015 the long short term memory lstm model is used to assess the response of water level at different stations to the yangtze river streamflow and discharge of cipl as well guo and lai 2020 the support vector machines svms are also adopted to simulate the influence of different river lake hydrological conditions to the water exchange in the yprls zhang et al 2019 meanwhile the relationship between the water level as yichang station the water level of poyang lake s upstream tributaries and the water level at the hukou station is established by the artificial fuzzy neural networks anfiss guo et al 2008 eventually the random forests rf model is compared with artificial neural networks support vector regression and a linear model by the results of real time forecasting while rf model is found to have the best output li et al 2016 nevertheless the obvious shortage of the statistic model is the absence relationship with physical laws though the quality and efficiency of the simulations is rather good as a result it would be usually hard for the statistic model to interpret the physical mechanism of simulated results at a high extent as well as to be optimized whilst the applicability and robustness of the statistical models require the collection of more observational data in advance talukder et al 2021 from the above descriptions neither of the hydrodynamic or statistical models could meet the requirement of simulating the dynamic of water exchange in the yprls efficiently and revealing potential mechanisms of it simultaneously that is the low simulation efficiency and the changing lakebed due to sad mining erosion and deposition are detrimental to utilize the hydrodynamic model for this purpose yao et al 2019 yao et al 2018 furthermore the disconnection between statistical models and physical processes leads to a difficult identification of the potential influencing factors of the water exchange for example long term effective methods for distinguishing between the bfl and lake drainage into the river in the yprls are still scarce li et al 2017 for these reasons we attempted to combine the advantages of hydrodynamic model and statistical model by constructing a physic based framework which is conductive to interpret the simulated results and reveal the potential mechanisms of the water exchange aiming at optimizing the statistical method the optimized statistical method is expected to quantify the responses of water exchange in the yprls to multiple influencing factors more accurately and efficiently reveal potential mechanism of the occurrence of the brl event effectively and ultimately work as a valuably fundamental tool for investigating the effects of changing environment on the yprls consequently a novel statistical model i e the yangtze poyang water exchange statistic model ypwes was developed to simulate the water exchange in the yprls more accurately and efficiently the established ypwes model was expected to improve the distinction of the bidirectional flow and the lake drainage into the river in the yprls the main objectives of this study were 1 to develop a statistical model to simulate the water exchange that considers both the impact of the yangtze river discharge and the local catchment inflow in the yprls 2 to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the established model and compare it with existing hydrodynamic and statistical models and 3 to use the established model to improve our understanding of the bidirectional flow in the water exchange 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yprls consists of the poyang lake and the middle reaches of the yangtze river from jiujiang hydrological station to balijiang hydrological station the yprls is located at the middle reach of the yangtze river 115 50 116 50 e and 28 20 29 50 n fig 1 the poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china and spans approximately 170 km from north to south and 74 km from east to west the catchment area of the poyang lake is 1 622 105 km2 and it receives water from five upstream rivers the ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers shankman et al 2006 the poyang lake discharges into the yangtze river via the hukou outlet which is a narrow channel located at the north end of the poyang lake yao et al 2019 shankman et al 2006 several hydrological stations and water level stations in the yangtze river and the poyang lake catchment have been set up to observe the hydrological regime jiujiang station hukou stations and balijiang station are located in the middle reach of the yangtze river five water level stations i e xingzi duchang wucheng poyang and kangshan stations are evenly distributed in the poyang lake region in addition seven hydrological stations i e qiujin wanjiabu waizhou lijuiadu meigang hushan and dufengkeng stations are located along the five upstream rivers that flow into the poyang lake 2 2 data the data used in this study include the daily measured water level and discharge at several gauge stations table 1 which were obtained from the changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources and the hydrological statistical yearbook five water level stations xingzi duchang wucheng kangshan and poyang stations were used to represent the equivalent water level in the poyang lake region seven hydrological stations qiujin wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang hushan and dufengkeng stations located at the outlets of the five upstream rivers were used to calculate the discharge of the cipl according to statistical analysis and data from the literature li et al 2020 chen et al 2019 the measured discharge and water level at the hukou station indicate the water exchange in the yprls while the daily measured streamflow at jiujiang station represents the yangtze river streamflow the measured daily discharge and water level for the period of 2003 2011 were used to establish the ypwes model and the data for the periods of 1971 2002 and 2012 2016 were used to validate the ypwes model 3 methodology 3 1 generalization of the yprls a lumped framework was developed to generalize the yprls fig 2 this framework is essentially a river network composed of two channels the yangtze river and the xingzi hukou channel and three nodes jiujiang station hukou station and the lake area therefore the poyang lake in the lumped framework consists of the lake area the xingzi hukou channel and hukou station the xingzi hukou channel is located between xingzi station and hukou station in the northern part of the poyang lake while the lake area is the remaining part of the poyang lake the lake area is generalized as a node in the river network having an equivalent water level z p m which reflects the water storage in the lake area and the potential discharge ability of the lake area z p is calculated using the mean water level at the five water level stations in the poyang lake furthermore according to existing studies there is a function relationship between the measured water level at the upstream and downstream nodes of a channel and the discharge measured at the downstream node of a channel zhang et al 2015 dai et al 1999 1 q d o w n s t r e a m f z u p s t r e a m z d o w n s t r e a m where q downstream m3 s is the discharge measured at the downstream node whilst z upstream m and z downstream m are the water levels measured at the upstream node and downstream node respectively eq 1 is often expressed as an exponential equation fan et al 2019 ge et al 1981 this statistical relationship helps to simplify the simulation of discharge and water level at the nodes in the lumped framework meanwhile the response of z p to the discharge of the poyang lake s outflow q h m3 s and the discharge of the cipl q pin m3 s is derived according to the water balance principle given that evaporation and precipitation provide a minor influence which could be ignored on the water budget of the poyang lake the water storage volume v 108 m3 of poyang lake is mainly determined by q h and q pin wang et al 2021 xu et al 2021 li et al 2020 chen et al 2019 xu et al 2014 on the other hand it obvious that the dynamic of v is basically positively related to that of z p which implies that z p could be determined by q pin and q h particularly at the daily scale the variation of the poyang lake s water volume v is approximately assumed to be an continuous function of z p and thus we have 2 δ v q h q p i n δ t f z p where t is the time step which is taken as a day 86 400 s 3 2 derivation of the equations for the ypwes model the equations of the ypwes model were derived from eqs 1 and 2 while variables in the equations were determined according to the water balance principle and the relationship between the difference of discharge and that of water level moreover a statistical method was employed to estimate the coefficients of equations the four basic equations of the ypwes model were derived by the method described in appendix a then 3 q h 1 c f q h 1 g q j z p c 5 a 5 q h 1 b 5 q j c 5 z p d 5 q j 2 e 5 z p 2 f 5 q j z p 4 z h c 1 a 1 q j b 1 q h c 1 z p d 1 q j 2 e 1 q h 2 f 1 z p 2 g 1 q j q h h 1 z p q h 5 q h 2 c f q h 2 g q j q p i n c 6 a 6 q h 2 b 6 q j c 6 q p i n d 6 q j 2 e 6 q p i n 2 f 6 q j q p i n 6 δ z p δ v v z p δ v c 7 a 7 z p b 7 z p 2 where the subscripts 1 and 2 represent two different algorithms used to simulate q h and the subscript c indicates that the simulated q h has been corrected by constructed correction functions g q j z p and g q j q pin respectively moreover the method to determine partial derivative v z p which is important for developing the ypwes model is described in appendix a as well the calculation flow of the ypwes model is shown in fig 3 in the simulation of daily q h and z h conducted by the ypwes model the daily measured q j and q pin were adopted as the boundary conditions while the daily measured z p and q h were adopted as the initial conditions furthermore it is necessary to determine the coefficients of the basic equations and the parameters of the ypwes model before the simulation the coefficients for simulating q hs1 q hs2 and z h are completely determined by the measured the parameters of the ypwes model are exhibited in eq 6 i e g q j z p and g q j q pin because their values are partially determined by the user the parameters of the ypwes model are determined in the following order the coefficients of eq 6 the coefficients of g q j z p and the coefficients of g q j q pin the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the model s performance as follows 7 n s e 1 i 1 n m i s i 2 i 1 n m i m 2 8 r 2 i 1 n m i m s i s i 1 n m i m 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 9 r m s e i 1 n m i s i 2 n where m and s represent the measured and simulated data respectively m and s are the mean observed and simulated values respectively 3 3 method of identifying the brl event occurrence the bidirectional flow in the yprls was distinguished by making a distinction between the brl event and lake drainage occurrences that the negative and positive values of q h reflect the brl event occurrence and lake drainage occurrence respectively furthermore the occurrence of brl event can be identified from the statistical relationships with the variables that are not involved in q h li et al 2017 accordingly variable k from eq a 6 representing the proportion of q h attributed to the yangtze river streamflow and equivalent water level in the lake area is applied to distinguish the bidirectional flow the value of variable k is calculated as follows 10 k a 8 z p b 8 q j the relationship between k and z p is expected to linearize the irregular q h z h relationship huang et al 2017 yang et al 2016 additionally k and z h are used to construct the discharge identification function dif m which is used to identify the bidirectional flow and has the following form 11 d i f f k z h a 9 k 2 b 9 k z h eq 11 essentially calculated the constant factor in the binomial fitting of k against z h which equals the value of dif while the threshold range of the constant factor corresponding to the brl event occurrence would help to make a distinction between it and lake drainage by certain steps at first the coefficients a 8 and b 8 in eq 10 were determined according to the daily measured z p and q j from 2003 to 2016 whilst the coefficients a 9 and b 9 in eq 11 were determined by the binomial fitting of k against z h from 2003 to 2016 subsequently the value of dif was calculated adopting daily simulated z h for the period of 1971 2016 eventually the threshold of dif was determined by the maximum and minimum values of dif thus the potential brl event occurrence is identified if the value of dif corresponding to daily measured z p and qj as well as daily simulated z h is within this threshold it s highlighted that the calculated value of dif is within the threshold range of it is a necessary condition of the brl event occurrence which implies the potential brl event may ultimately not occur the above method is called the dif method subsequently the recognition rate that is defined as the ratio of the identified brl event occurrences to all the brl event occurrences was used to evaluate the performance of the method whilst a brl event occurrence is recorded when daily q h is negative in a day thus for the identification of the brl event occurrence a higher recognition rate indicates a better performance of the dif method the process of the dif method is illustrated in fig 4 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation the simulation period was from 1971 to 2016 the daily q h and z h values measured from 2003 to 2011 were used to determine the coefficients of the four basic equations and eq a 5 the estimation of the coefficients is illustrated in table 2 the estimation is accurate because the nse and r2 values of the simulated variables range from 0 926 to 0 992 the calibration period was from 2003 to 2011 while the validation period was from 2012 to 2016 a which was after the impoundment of the three gorges dam tgd and from 1971 to 2002 b which was before the impoundment of the tgd the nse and r2 values were employed to evaluate the simulated q h while the nse r2 and rmse m were employed to evaluate the simulated z h the simulation results show that the model performed quite well fig 5 the nse and r2 values between the measured and simulated q h range from 0 939 to 0 948 for the calibration period and the validation period a and they are greater than 0 9 for the validation period b table 1 the nse and r2 values of the simulated z h are greater than 0 99 for the calibration period and the validation period a and they are about 0 97 for the validation period b compared with the measured z h moreover the rmse value is less than 0 32 m for the calibration period and the validation period a but it increases to 0 635 m for the validation period b table 3 in addition the simulation time of the ypwes model was shorter than 10 s in all three periods according to the simulation results the accuracy of the simulated q h decreased by about 0 04 before the impoundment of the tgd but the accuracy of the simulated z h did not significantly change in order to further evaluate the performance of the ypwes model it was used to simulate the q h and z h and the results were compared with the results of nine existing mechanism and statistical models reported in previous studies guo and lai 2020 zhang et al 2019 yao et al 2018 ye et al 2017 huang et al 2017 li et al 2015 li et al 2014 lai et al 2013 nine existing models were selected for the simulation of the hydrodynamic process in the yprls the nse r2 and rmse m values and simulation times of the nine existing models were compared with those of the ypwes model table 4 the results show that the nse and r2 values of the ypwes model are higher than those of the other models from 2003 to 2016 and its rmse value is lower for the same period in addition the ypwes model has a slightly lower r2 value than the bpnn model from 1980 to 1999 ye et al 2017 however the accuracy of the ypwes model is higher than those of the other models during this period except that it has an accuracy which is equivalent to those of the bpnn model li et al 2015 the lstm model guo and lai 2020 and the convolutional hierarchical attention model cham lai et al 2013 particularly for the simulation of the wet year with an extreme flood event 1998 lai et al 2013 the simulation results effectively reflect the variation trends of the peak discharge and peak water level and the relative errors in the peak discharge and peak water level of the simulation are 12 24 and 4 42 respectively fig 6 in addition the simulation results obtained using the ypwes model are more accurate than the simulation results obtained using the cham for a typical dry year 2006 lai et al 2013 the simulation results show that the ypwes model can be used to analyze flood events and dry events consequently the ypwes model is generally more accurate than the nine existing models and is applicable to the simulation of the water exchange in the yprls 4 2 model sensitivity analysis in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the ypwes model parameter sensitivity analysis and initial value sensitivity analysis were conducted with respect to the assessment of the parameter sensitivity each parameter of the ypwes model was varied from 0 5 times to 1 5 times in steps of 0 1 times to reflect the possible values determined by the user only one parameter was changed at any time and the value of the corresponding nse was simulated using the ypwes model fig 7a if the value of the corresponding nse was greater than 0 75 the simulation results are acceptable while the simulation results were good when the value of the corresponding nse was greater than 0 9 according to the nse values corresponding to the varied parameters the changes in the parameters used for correcting the errors did not have a significant impact on the simulation accuracy but the nse value decreased rapidly when the parameters for calculating v z p were changed therefore the parameters for determining v z p have the most significant influence on the simulation while the parameters of the two correction functions g q j z p and g q j q pin have smaller influences on the simulation the initial sensitivity analysis involved q h and z p which are the initial conditions of the ypwes model in order to conduct the analysis the value of each initial condition was varied from 0 5 times to 1 5 times in steps of 0 25 times and the two initial conditions were combined to indicate the different initial discharge ability of poyang lake and the initial water storage in poyang lake for the 24 combinations of the two varied initial conditions q h was simulated using the ypwes model and was compared with the q h simulated using the measured initial conditions fig 7b the simulation results show that the simulation conducted using the ypwes model is divergent if z p is reduced to 0 5 times however the simulation results obtained by the combination initial conditions trend toward those obtained by the unchanged initial conditions within 50 days after the start of the simulation consequently the ypwes model is sufficiently stable to cope with reasonable deviations in the initial values 4 3 distinguishing the bidirectional flow the daily calculated k is obtained simultaneously with the daily measured q h thus a certain variable k corresponds to q h in a day compared with the q h z h relationship the corresponding k z h relationship for the period of 1971 2016 exhibits a more significant linearity because of higher values of r2 as illustrated in fig 8 particularly for the period of 2003 2016 the linearity of k z h relationship still exists when the values of the q h corresponding to k increases in steps of about 1000 m3 s fig 9 furthermore as illustrated in fig 9 scattered points which indicate daily k z h relationships are generally concentrated in specific areas when q h has certain values whilst the k z h relationship exhibits potential hysteresis when q h ranges from 1000 m3 s to 12 000 m3 s specifically scattered points corresponding to the brl event occurrence and lake discharge exceeding15000 m3 s are basically concentrated in the upper left corner and lower right corner respectively fig 9a fig 9q moreover the area occupied by scattered points gradually moves from top left to bottom right with the corresponding q h increases evidently the above characteristics of the k z h relationships are obvious as well for the period of 1971 2002 fig 10 however the movement of areas occupied by scattered points is more complex whilst areas corresponding to the different ranges of q h are more difficult to distinguish the significant linearity of k z h relationship is basis for the adoption of the dif method according to the simulated k and z h from 2003 to 2016 the coefficients of the dif were determined table 5 then as shown in fig 11 the ranges of dif corresponding to the brl event occurrence before and after the impoundment of tgd 2003 are from 8 7 m to 10 5 m and from 9 1 m to 9 9 m respectively while exceeding 85 of the dif values have a range of 9 3 9 9 m before 2003 and 9 3 9 5 m after 2003 in addition 84 51 and 92 17 of the dif values corresponding to the brl event occurrence were obtained for the period of june august before and after 2003 respectively thus the different distributions of dif s values corresponding to the brl event occurrence may lead to two threshold ranges of the dif then two threshold ranges of the dif containing most of its values corresponding to the brl event occurrence were determined that is threshold range a of the dif which was determined adopting data before 2003 has a range of 9 2 10 0 m while threshold range b of the dif has a range of 9 2 9 4 m based on data after 2003 table 5 in order to comprehensively evaluate the performance of different threshold ranges the cognition rate from 1971 to 2002 and from 2003 to 2016was calculated using the threshold range a and threshold range b respectively as illustrated in fig 12 the recognition rate of lake drainage based on threshold range b and threshold range a are approximately over 94 and 78 respectively whilst the recognition rate of brl event occurrence based on threshold range b and threshold range a both exceed 94 overall the recognition rate of these identifications basically exceeds 93 except for the identification of lake drainage before 2003 furthermore based on different threshold ranges the annual frequency of the potential brl event occurrence decreases by 68 30 after 2003 this variation in the potential brl event occurrence reveals the influences of climate and human activities on the water exchange in the yprls li et al 2017 consequently the dif method based on the ypwes model could accurately identify the brl event for a long time period 5 discussion 5 1 model performance to evaluate the performance of the ypwes model the comparison between the ypwes model and nine existing models is conducted accordingly from 2003 to 2016 the simulation results of the ypwes model are more accurate and have a faster simulation efficiency compared with those of the existing models furthermore from 1971 to 2002 the ypwes matched the measured data more consistently when compared with hydrodynamic models mike21 efdc and cham in addition the simulation results show that the ypwes model is useful for simulating flood and dry events moreover regarding the comparisons with statistical models the nse and r2 values of the ypwes obtained simulated results from 1980 to 1999 are about 0 01 lower than that of the bpnn obtained simulated results li et al 2015 however the nse and r2 values of the ypwes obtained simulated results are similar or higher than that of the simulated results obtained by other statistical models additionally after the impoundment of the tgd the nse and r2 values of the ypwes obtained simulated q h are about 0 04 lower which may be due to that the statistical relationships are mainly estimated after the impoundment of the tgd nevertheless two correction functions successfully maintain the stability of the ypwes model ensuring the nse and r2 values of the simulated q h exceed 0 9 except for higher accuracy the simulation time of the ypwes model is within 10 s which is at least two times shorter than that of other statistical models while the ypwes model has a ratio of the calibration period s duration to the validation period s duration which is about 0 2 times and is much smaller than that of other statistical models since a shorter calibration period and a longer validation period usually result in a poorer simulation accuracy the shorter simulation time obviously shows the special advantage of the ypwes model talukder et al 2021 moreover in contrary to that existing statistical models generally just output one hydrological variable the ypwes outputs the discharge and water level simultaneously the shortage of statistical models may due to the distinction between it and physical mechanisms whilst the proposed ypwes model is developed on the base of the lumped framework thereby basically having a better performance than the statistical models overall the ypwes model is generally more accurate and efficient than the other existing models and outputs more simulated hydrological variables which shows the ypwes model is a promising alternative for establishing a basin simulator and predicting dynamics of water exchange in the yprls 5 2 characteristics of the brl event occurrence the ypwes model also helps to distinguish the bidirectional flow as the base of dif method which offers an approach identifying exceeding 93 of the daily brl event s occurrences from 1971 to 2016 compared with the identification of the brl event s occurrence conducted by li et al 2017 the dif method improves the effectivity of identification significantly meanwhile the dif method adopts variables measured in the yprls rather than variables measured outside the yprls huang et al 2017 that is the dif method which aims at providing a more sufficient identification of the occurrence of the brl event just by data measured in the yprls could improve the understanding of the brl event s occurrence indeed the advantage of the dif method is mainly attributed to the regular k z h relationship which is favorable to identify the brl event occurrence by distinguishing the scattered points corresponding to the brl event occurrence from other scattered points as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 in contrast the disordered and nonlinear q h z h relationship makes the analysis and prediction of the brl event occurrence as well as the dynamic of water exchange in the yprls more difficult bing et al 2018 huang et al 2017 li et al 2017 thus the regular k z h relationship may not only help to develop the dif method but also facilitate the study of the water exchange s variation in the yprls furthermore it s notable that though variable k rather than q h has a more significant relationship with z h the algorithm of k mainly derives from the derivation of basic equations of the ypwes model instead of the obvious physical relationship between z p and z h as well as q j and z h thereby representing that the ypwes could help to quantify valuably potential physical relationship between known variables nevertheless the k z h relationship is essentially applied to linearize the q h z h relationship thus they are bound to have similar dynamics after the tgd impounds for example as shown in fig 8 these relationships are both more linear after 2003 meanwhile since the threshold range of the dif s values corresponding to the brl event is smaller after 2003 which implies that the k z h relationship is more ordered after the impoundment of the tgd the q h z h relationship should be more regular after the tgd impounds given that the k z h relationship has similar variation pattern with that of the former it s noteworthy that the q h z h relationship is measured at the conjunction of river and lake thus should be ordered if the influence of the yangtze river forcing is negligible on the contrary the yangtze river streamflow rather than the cipl is the main factor influencing q h when the brl event occurs while z h is closely related to the discharge measured at hankou station which is located at the yangtze river s mainstream yao et al 2018 huang et al 2017 gao et al 2014 thus it is the yangtze river streamflow which is the primary factor leading to the change of q h z h relationship when the brl event occurs it may be due to the yangtze river streamflow is significantly reduced after the impoundment of the tgd that the period where q h z h relationship becomes more regular coincides with the impoundment of the tgd yang et al 2016 gao et al 2013 that is the q h z h relationship corresponding to the brl event occurrence changes with the yangtze river streamflow 5 3 limitations and future research the ypwes model was demonstrated to be stable in terms of simulating the water exchange in the yprls the initial condition analysis shows that the initial z p should exceed 6 81 m while the actual z p from 1971 to 2016 exceeds about 9 m which implies the requirements of the input conditions are generally met nevertheless the storage capacity curve of the poyang lake is estimated to be a continuous and single valued function in contrary to which the hysteresis of storage stage relationship of the poyang lake makes the storage capacity curve much more complex liu et al 2020 yao et al 2018 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 gao et al 2014 although the simulation error caused by the estimated storage capacity curve is corrected by the two constructed correction functions more work is required to improve the ypwes model first the coupling of the impacts from the wind forcing and underwater topography which results in a more comprehensive assessment of the water exchange in the yprls should be considered yao et al 2019 yao et al 2018 then basic equations which are based on the physical mechanism could be used to simplify the ypwes model finally the estimation of the storage capacity curve of the poyang lake can be improved moreover the ypwes model could not only produce an accurate and efficient simulation of water exchange in the yprls which is a typical river lake systems across the globe but also be employed for simulating water exchange in other river networks and river lake systems specifically the ypwes model is based on a lumped framework which is essentially a one dimensional river network and could be constructed easily then based on the lumped framework if the discharge stage relationship can be accurately estimated and the water budget process can be effectively quantified using the water balance principle the four basic equations can be derived and adopted to establish the ypwes model 6 conclusions in this study a novel statistical model was developed to generate an accurate and efficient assessment of the variation in the water exchange in the yprls based on a lumped framework the ypwes model improves the accuracy of simulation and reduces the necessary computational resources for simulation when compared with nine existing models moreover the ypwes model could quantify and evaluate the relationships between the water exchange and the potential influencing factors in the yprls employing the ypwes model it was found that the thresholds of dif which have ranges of 9 3 9 6 m and of 9 2 10 0 m respectively can be used to identify more than 93 of the bwl and lake drainage occurrence thus the threshold range of the dif corresponding to the brl event occurrence was smaller after 2003 because the discharge stage relationship at hukou station when the brl event occurs is more regular mainly due to the change of the yangtze river due to its accuracy and efficiency the ypwes could improve the understanding of the response of water exchange to the climate change and human activities additionally since the connection with physical mechanism he ypwes model helps to systematically quantify and assess the new statistical relationships between the variables in the yprls furthermore the ypwes model can be utilized as a module in a simulator to provide the boundary conditions of hydrodynamic models consequently the developed ypwes model would be a valuable fundamental tool of improving the quantification and understanding of the water exchange s dynamic in the yprls or other river lake system

that in the following derivation in addition z h can also be estimated using q pin and q j fan 2019 a 4 z h c a ln q j b ln q p i n moreover eqs a 1 and a 2 can be combined to determine the relationship between q h and other variables a 5 q h c 2 a 2 q j b 2 z h c 2 z p d 2 z p 2 e 2 z p q h f 2 q j 2 g 2 q j q h eq a 5 can be simplified into an iterative equation eq a 6 by considering the estimation error ε a 6 q h ε f q h c e 2 z p q h g 2 q j q h c k q h where the terms without q h are treated as a constant c whilst k is the coefficient of the combined term containing q h using an appropriate value of k could make eq a 5 an accurate method for simulating q h thus an iteration is conducted on q h ε once and is added to eq a 6 thus a 7 q h f q h ε f q h 2 k ε 2 because the values of f q h and f q h ε are calculated using eq a 5 which are fixed on a day q h can be accurately simulated if k 2 however according to values of the measured variables which were used to calculate k the value of k varies from 0 574 to 1 214 therefore q h cannot be accurately simulated using the iterative equation because the simulation error will become more significant as the iteration progresses when k 2 a 8 q h 1 3 ε f q h 1 3 c eq a 8 is the form of eq a 6 when the accurate simulation of q h is obtained comparing the terms in eqs a 6 and a 8 it s obvious that terms containing q h are removed from the estimation equations of q h to simulate q h accurately since the cipl has a primary influence on q h a new method for simulating q h can be developed by removing the terms containing q h after combining eqs a 1 a 2 and a 4 fan 2018 a 9 q h c 3 a 3 q j b 3 z h c 3 z p d 3 ln q j e 3 ln q p i n f 3 z p 2 g 3 q j 2 as reflected by eqs a 5 and a 9 q h is influenced by the combination of several influencing factors mainly consisting of the coupling of q j and z h and that of z p and z h meanwhile according to eqs a 1 and a 2 the responses of q h to these couplings represent the impacts from the poyang lake forcing and the yangtze river forcing on q h respectively thus the offsetting of two couplings effects on q h indicates the difference between the influence of the yangtze river forcing and that of poyang lake forcing on q h which would make the influence of z h on q h negligible thereby providing a new approach to simulate q h by a function of z p and q j as following a 10 q h f q j z p c 4 a 4 q j b 4 z p c 4 q j 2 d 4 z p q j e 4 z p 2 eqs a 10 and a 9 provide two methods for simulating q h which obtain simulation results q h1 and q h2 respectively q h2 is more accurate than q h1 because of the involvement of the cipl however the hysteresis of storage stage relationship of the poyang lake and the water level gradient in the lake area which appears in the dry season introduce significant simulation errors into q h1 and q h2 yao et al 2018 huang et al 2017 gao et al 2014 therefore the simulated errors in eqs a 9 and a 10 are influenced by the system state of the yprls q j q pin z p and z h and can be mediated by the correction functions which preferentially adopted at least two measured variables in eqs a 9 and a 10 thus the measured q j and simulated z p were used to construct the correction functions for eq a 10 while the measured q j and q pin were used to construct the correction functions for eq a 9 which obtains eq a 11 and eq a 12 respectively thus a 11 q h 1 c f q h 1 g q j z p c 5 a 5 q h 1 b 5 q j c 5 z p d 5 q j 2 e 5 z p 2 f 5 q j z p a 12 q h 2 c f q h 2 g q j q p i n c 6 a 6 q h 2 b 6 q j c 6 q p i n d 6 q j 2 e 6 q p i n 2 f 6 q j q p i n where the subscript c denotes that the simulated q h has been corrected eq 2 indicates that the daily change in z p z p is influenced by the daily change of v if the daily changes of v and z p approximately exhibit as linear process then a 13 δ v δ z p v t δ t z p t δ t v z p a 14 δ z p δ v v z p q p i n q h δ t v z p subsequently a recursion method is adopted for simulating z p and can be combined with the simulation of q h using the ypwes model a 15 z p z p δ z p z p δ v v z p z p q p i n q h c 7 a 7 z p b 7 z p 2 where v z p is the key to the recursion method and is assumed to have the form of a quadratic function the coefficients of eq a 15 are estimated by datasets which consist of the measured q h estimated q pin and measured z p however thousands of datasets are available for determining coefficients in eq a 15 while these datasets will introduce errors in the coefficient estimations at certain extent in addition the hysteresis of v z p relationship makes it difficult to obtain accurate estimated coefficients in order to overcome above problems a screening process was developed to identify datasets with negligible errors fig a1 first the coefficients for simulating v z p are estimated using initial datasets then the estimated v z p is adopted by the ypwes model to simulate z p if the accuracy of the simulated z p is high enough the estimated v z p is acceptable for the ypwes model otherwise the simulated z p denoted as zp1is obtained by eq a 15 the two methods for simulating z p are both based on eq a 15 while q h simulated by eq a 12 and measured q h are adopted by the ypwes model and other methods respectively subsequently z p1 is used to replace the measured z p to renew the datasets and is substituted into eq a 5 to replace initial z p in its linear term therefore the value of q h calculated by eq a 5 will be changed thus the absolute value of this change is calculated as follows a 16 δ q h c 2 z p 1 z p eq a 5 has a similar form with eqs a 9 and a 10 while leads to higher estimation accuracy od q h thus in accordance with the given threshold of abs δq h eq a 5 is used to identify z p1 which is similar with the measured z p in addition the product of δv and the simulated δz p should be positive if the renewed daily dataset meets these two criteria it will be retained otherwise it will be removed subsequently the coefficients of eq a 15 are re estimated using the screened datasets beginning with eq a 15 which contains the re estimated coefficients a new round of screening is conducted until an accurate simulated z p is obtained the recommended threshold of abs δq h is 1 10 based on experience appendix b supporting information supplementary data associated with this

8057,study region the yangtze poyang river lake system yprls which includes the poyang lake and the middle reach of yangtze river basin study focus the water exchange in the yprls is complex and vital to the dynamic of it thereby requiring well simulation nevertheless existing numerical models have shortages in accuracy efficiency and revealing potential relationships thus for providing an accurate and efficient statistical model as a fundamental tool for investigating the effects of changing environment on the yprls we developed the yangtze poyang water exchange statistic ypwes model in this study the ypwes model was employed to simulate the water exchange in the yprls from 1971 to 2016 and improve our understanding of the backflow from the river to lake brl in the yprls new hydrological insights for the region based on a physic based lumped framework the established ypwes model is basically more accurate and efficient than nine existing models meanwhile 93 of the brl event will occur when the value of discharge identification function dif is 9 2 10 0 m while the threshold range of the dif corresponding to the brl event occurrence was smaller after 2003 because the discharge stage relationship changes with the yangtze river streamflow when the brl event occurs our work provides a valuable model and may help to investigate the cause and influence of the water exchange in the yprls keywords yangtze poyang river lake system water exchange yangtze poyang water exchange statistic model backflow from the river to lake 1 introduction the hydrodynamic processes occurring at the junctions of lakes rivers and seas are affected by many factors with diverse characteristics mainly under the impact from the human activities and climate change wu et al 2021 chen et al 2018 yang et al 2016 yao et al 2014 llebot et al 2014 the complexity and non linear relationships of the water exchange due to multiple influencing factors have been reported across the globe in recent decades luo et al 2020 huang et al 2017 li et al 2017 lawrence et al 2004 this complex non linear and complex relationships are detrimental to gain the patterns of the river lake system s dynamic as well as the to manage of water environment and water ecology in the river lake systems zhang et al 2020 li et al 2019 yang et al 2016 therefore an effective evaluation and quantification of the water exchange in the river lake system is required the poyang lake which is the largest freshwater lake in china and located at the south bank of the middle reaches of the yangtze river is connected to the yangtze river forming the yangtze poyang river lake system yprls the poyang lake predominantly receives surface inflow from the its upstream rivers and subsequently empties into the yangtze river through its north outlet shankman et al 2006 thus the yprls is a typical large scale river lake system within which the hydrological regime fluctuates dramatically between the dry and wet periods of the poyang lake basin jiang et al 2021 li et al 2020 li et al 2019 li et al 2017 yang et al 2016 furthermore several studies have shown that the water exchange in the yprls has changed significantly during the past 20 years which is mainly attributed to the yangtze river streamflow in the mainstream and the catchment inflow of the poyang lake cipl chen et al 2016 gao et al 2013 hu et al 2007 lu et al 2021 su et al 2016 xu et al 2020 yao et al 2018 ye et al 2013 therefore the hydrodynamic process as well as the aquatic ecological health of the yprls have been changed in recent decades chen et al 2019 li et al 2019 yang et al 2016 li et al 2015 zhang and werner 2015 additionally the complexity of the water exchange is mainly presented as the combination of backflow from the river to the lake brl and drainage from the poyang lake into the mainstream of the yangtze river accompanying with a dispersive and hysteretic discharge stage relationship jiang et al 2021 yao et al 2018 li et al 2017 huang et al 2017 zhang and werner 2015 particularly the occurrence of brl event leading to high water level as well as flood event in the poyang lake bing 2018 yang et al 2016 however existing studies of revealing the mechanism and regularity of the brl event s occurrence in the yprls that are available in international magazines are rare as a typical paper li et al 2017 used the ratio of cipl s discharge to yangtze river streamflow as an indication of the daily occurrence of backflow from 1960 to 2010 while 74 of the brl event would occur when this ratio was lower than 5 meanwhile huang et al 2017 reported that measured q h has a good fitting relationship with water level measured at hankou station which is located outside the yprls besides the changing environment especially human activities such as sad mining dam operation and delimit reservoirs would bring new stresses on the water cycle water quality carbon cycle and ecological system in the yprls which is determined by the water exchange in the yprls at a certain or high extent li et al 2019 lu et al 2021 wu et al 2017 yao et al 2019a b therefore an accurate and efficient simulation of the water exchange in the yprls revealing the potential mechanism of the water exchange is needed for this purpose mechanism hydrodynamic models and statistical models are widely used to simulate the discharge and water level at the outlet of the poyang lake hydrodynamic models are based on strong physical mechanisms in general bates et al 2010 gerbeau et al 2001 many of them are employed in studies just considering the effect of hydrodynamic process in the poyang lake on the water exchange in the yprls which is mainly influenced by the wind forcing and underwater topography changes yao et al 2019 yao et al 2018 furthermore hydrodynamic models integrating the hydrodynamic process in the poyang lake and the mainstream of the yangtze river have been employed to simulate the severe flooding and dry events and the effect of the three gorges dam impoundment on the water exchange in the yprls bing 2018 lai et al 2013 lai et al 2012 meanwhile hydrodynamic models are used to reveal the effects of water exchange on the surface hydrological connectivity degree of hysteresis transport trajectory and residence time coupling of the hydrodynamic and hydrological processes and water age in the poyang lake as well huang et al 2021 li et al 2019 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 li and yao 2015 li et al 2015 li et al 2013 nevertheless though the hydrodynamic models are effectively employed the requirements for a variety of data providing initial and underlying surface conditions and discrete generalization networks with a considerable number of grids are detrimental to improve computing efficiency specifically the hydrodynamic models simulating processes in the yprls have more than 20 000 grids resulting in the simulation for every year costs about 6 h yao et al 2019 yao et al 2018 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 to obtain higher accuracies and shorter simulation time of simulations the statistical models have received more attention in recent years several studies have shown that statistical models usually spend several minutes in providing a daily result whilst hydrodynamic models basically spent multi hours in the same simulating guo and lai 2020 ye et al 2017 li et al 2015 li et al 2013 with respect to the adaptation of statistical models in the yprls the back propagation neural networks bpnns are applied to simulate the water level variations and water level decline in the poyang lake ye et al 2017 li et al 2015 the long short term memory lstm model is used to assess the response of water level at different stations to the yangtze river streamflow and discharge of cipl as well guo and lai 2020 the support vector machines svms are also adopted to simulate the influence of different river lake hydrological conditions to the water exchange in the yprls zhang et al 2019 meanwhile the relationship between the water level as yichang station the water level of poyang lake s upstream tributaries and the water level at the hukou station is established by the artificial fuzzy neural networks anfiss guo et al 2008 eventually the random forests rf model is compared with artificial neural networks support vector regression and a linear model by the results of real time forecasting while rf model is found to have the best output li et al 2016 nevertheless the obvious shortage of the statistic model is the absence relationship with physical laws though the quality and efficiency of the simulations is rather good as a result it would be usually hard for the statistic model to interpret the physical mechanism of simulated results at a high extent as well as to be optimized whilst the applicability and robustness of the statistical models require the collection of more observational data in advance talukder et al 2021 from the above descriptions neither of the hydrodynamic or statistical models could meet the requirement of simulating the dynamic of water exchange in the yprls efficiently and revealing potential mechanisms of it simultaneously that is the low simulation efficiency and the changing lakebed due to sad mining erosion and deposition are detrimental to utilize the hydrodynamic model for this purpose yao et al 2019 yao et al 2018 furthermore the disconnection between statistical models and physical processes leads to a difficult identification of the potential influencing factors of the water exchange for example long term effective methods for distinguishing between the bfl and lake drainage into the river in the yprls are still scarce li et al 2017 for these reasons we attempted to combine the advantages of hydrodynamic model and statistical model by constructing a physic based framework which is conductive to interpret the simulated results and reveal the potential mechanisms of the water exchange aiming at optimizing the statistical method the optimized statistical method is expected to quantify the responses of water exchange in the yprls to multiple influencing factors more accurately and efficiently reveal potential mechanism of the occurrence of the brl event effectively and ultimately work as a valuably fundamental tool for investigating the effects of changing environment on the yprls consequently a novel statistical model i e the yangtze poyang water exchange statistic model ypwes was developed to simulate the water exchange in the yprls more accurately and efficiently the established ypwes model was expected to improve the distinction of the bidirectional flow and the lake drainage into the river in the yprls the main objectives of this study were 1 to develop a statistical model to simulate the water exchange that considers both the impact of the yangtze river discharge and the local catchment inflow in the yprls 2 to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the established model and compare it with existing hydrodynamic and statistical models and 3 to use the established model to improve our understanding of the bidirectional flow in the water exchange 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yprls consists of the poyang lake and the middle reaches of the yangtze river from jiujiang hydrological station to balijiang hydrological station the yprls is located at the middle reach of the yangtze river 115 50 116 50 e and 28 20 29 50 n fig 1 the poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china and spans approximately 170 km from north to south and 74 km from east to west the catchment area of the poyang lake is 1 622 105 km2 and it receives water from five upstream rivers the ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers shankman et al 2006 the poyang lake discharges into the yangtze river via the hukou outlet which is a narrow channel located at the north end of the poyang lake yao et al 2019 shankman et al 2006 several hydrological stations and water level stations in the yangtze river and the poyang lake catchment have been set up to observe the hydrological regime jiujiang station hukou stations and balijiang station are located in the middle reach of the yangtze river five water level stations i e xingzi duchang wucheng poyang and kangshan stations are evenly distributed in the poyang lake region in addition seven hydrological stations i e qiujin wanjiabu waizhou lijuiadu meigang hushan and dufengkeng stations are located along the five upstream rivers that flow into the poyang lake 2 2 data the data used in this study include the daily measured water level and discharge at several gauge stations table 1 which were obtained from the changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources and the hydrological statistical yearbook five water level stations xingzi duchang wucheng kangshan and poyang stations were used to represent the equivalent water level in the poyang lake region seven hydrological stations qiujin wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang hushan and dufengkeng stations located at the outlets of the five upstream rivers were used to calculate the discharge of the cipl according to statistical analysis and data from the literature li et al 2020 chen et al 2019 the measured discharge and water level at the hukou station indicate the water exchange in the yprls while the daily measured streamflow at jiujiang station represents the yangtze river streamflow the measured daily discharge and water level for the period of 2003 2011 were used to establish the ypwes model and the data for the periods of 1971 2002 and 2012 2016 were used to validate the ypwes model 3 methodology 3 1 generalization of the yprls a lumped framework was developed to generalize the yprls fig 2 this framework is essentially a river network composed of two channels the yangtze river and the xingzi hukou channel and three nodes jiujiang station hukou station and the lake area therefore the poyang lake in the lumped framework consists of the lake area the xingzi hukou channel and hukou station the xingzi hukou channel is located between xingzi station and hukou station in the northern part of the poyang lake while the lake area is the remaining part of the poyang lake the lake area is generalized as a node in the river network having an equivalent water level z p m which reflects the water storage in the lake area and the potential discharge ability of the lake area z p is calculated using the mean water level at the five water level stations in the poyang lake furthermore according to existing studies there is a function relationship between the measured water level at the upstream and downstream nodes of a channel and the discharge measured at the downstream node of a channel zhang et al 2015 dai et al 1999 1 q d o w n s t r e a m f z u p s t r e a m z d o w n s t r e a m where q downstream m3 s is the discharge measured at the downstream node whilst z upstream m and z downstream m are the water levels measured at the upstream node and downstream node respectively eq 1 is often expressed as an exponential equation fan et al 2019 ge et al 1981 this statistical relationship helps to simplify the simulation of discharge and water level at the nodes in the lumped framework meanwhile the response of z p to the discharge of the poyang lake s outflow q h m3 s and the discharge of the cipl q pin m3 s is derived according to the water balance principle given that evaporation and precipitation provide a minor influence which could be ignored on the water budget of the poyang lake the water storage volume v 108 m3 of poyang lake is mainly determined by q h and q pin wang et al 2021 xu et al 2021 li et al 2020 chen et al 2019 xu et al 2014 on the other hand it obvious that the dynamic of v is basically positively related to that of z p which implies that z p could be determined by q pin and q h particularly at the daily scale the variation of the poyang lake s water volume v is approximately assumed to be an continuous function of z p and thus we have 2 δ v q h q p i n δ t f z p where t is the time step which is taken as a day 86 400 s 3 2 derivation of the equations for the ypwes model the equations of the ypwes model were derived from eqs 1 and 2 while variables in the equations were determined according to the water balance principle and the relationship between the difference of discharge and that of water level moreover a statistical method was employed to estimate the coefficients of equations the four basic equations of the ypwes model were derived by the method described in appendix a then 3 q h 1 c f q h 1 g q j z p c 5 a 5 q h 1 b 5 q j c 5 z p d 5 q j 2 e 5 z p 2 f 5 q j z p 4 z h c 1 a 1 q j b 1 q h c 1 z p d 1 q j 2 e 1 q h 2 f 1 z p 2 g 1 q j q h h 1 z p q h 5 q h 2 c f q h 2 g q j q p i n c 6 a 6 q h 2 b 6 q j c 6 q p i n d 6 q j 2 e 6 q p i n 2 f 6 q j q p i n 6 δ z p δ v v z p δ v c 7 a 7 z p b 7 z p 2 where the subscripts 1 and 2 represent two different algorithms used to simulate q h and the subscript c indicates that the simulated q h has been corrected by constructed correction functions g q j z p and g q j q pin respectively moreover the method to determine partial derivative v z p which is important for developing the ypwes model is described in appendix a as well the calculation flow of the ypwes model is shown in fig 3 in the simulation of daily q h and z h conducted by the ypwes model the daily measured q j and q pin were adopted as the boundary conditions while the daily measured z p and q h were adopted as the initial conditions furthermore it is necessary to determine the coefficients of the basic equations and the parameters of the ypwes model before the simulation the coefficients for simulating q hs1 q hs2 and z h are completely determined by the measured the parameters of the ypwes model are exhibited in eq 6 i e g q j z p and g q j q pin because their values are partially determined by the user the parameters of the ypwes model are determined in the following order the coefficients of eq 6 the coefficients of g q j z p and the coefficients of g q j q pin the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the model s performance as follows 7 n s e 1 i 1 n m i s i 2 i 1 n m i m 2 8 r 2 i 1 n m i m s i s i 1 n m i m 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 9 r m s e i 1 n m i s i 2 n where m and s represent the measured and simulated data respectively m and s are the mean observed and simulated values respectively 3 3 method of identifying the brl event occurrence the bidirectional flow in the yprls was distinguished by making a distinction between the brl event and lake drainage occurrences that the negative and positive values of q h reflect the brl event occurrence and lake drainage occurrence respectively furthermore the occurrence of brl event can be identified from the statistical relationships with the variables that are not involved in q h li et al 2017 accordingly variable k from eq a 6 representing the proportion of q h attributed to the yangtze river streamflow and equivalent water level in the lake area is applied to distinguish the bidirectional flow the value of variable k is calculated as follows 10 k a 8 z p b 8 q j the relationship between k and z p is expected to linearize the irregular q h z h relationship huang et al 2017 yang et al 2016 additionally k and z h are used to construct the discharge identification function dif m which is used to identify the bidirectional flow and has the following form 11 d i f f k z h a 9 k 2 b 9 k z h eq 11 essentially calculated the constant factor in the binomial fitting of k against z h which equals the value of dif while the threshold range of the constant factor corresponding to the brl event occurrence would help to make a distinction between it and lake drainage by certain steps at first the coefficients a 8 and b 8 in eq 10 were determined according to the daily measured z p and q j from 2003 to 2016 whilst the coefficients a 9 and b 9 in eq 11 were determined by the binomial fitting of k against z h from 2003 to 2016 subsequently the value of dif was calculated adopting daily simulated z h for the period of 1971 2016 eventually the threshold of dif was determined by the maximum and minimum values of dif thus the potential brl event occurrence is identified if the value of dif corresponding to daily measured z p and qj as well as daily simulated z h is within this threshold it s highlighted that the calculated value of dif is within the threshold range of it is a necessary condition of the brl event occurrence which implies the potential brl event may ultimately not occur the above method is called the dif method subsequently the recognition rate that is defined as the ratio of the identified brl event occurrences to all the brl event occurrences was used to evaluate the performance of the method whilst a brl event occurrence is recorded when daily q h is negative in a day thus for the identification of the brl event occurrence a higher recognition rate indicates a better performance of the dif method the process of the dif method is illustrated in fig 4 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation the simulation period was from 1971 to 2016 the daily q h and z h values measured from 2003 to 2011 were used to determine the coefficients of the four basic equations and eq a 5 the estimation of the coefficients is illustrated in table 2 the estimation is accurate because the nse and r2 values of the simulated variables range from 0 926 to 0 992 the calibration period was from 2003 to 2011 while the validation period was from 2012 to 2016 a which was after the impoundment of the three gorges dam tgd and from 1971 to 2002 b which was before the impoundment of the tgd the nse and r2 values were employed to evaluate the simulated q h while the nse r2 and rmse m were employed to evaluate the simulated z h the simulation results show that the model performed quite well fig 5 the nse and r2 values between the measured and simulated q h range from 0 939 to 0 948 for the calibration period and the validation period a and they are greater than 0 9 for the validation period b table 1 the nse and r2 values of the simulated z h are greater than 0 99 for the calibration period and the validation period a and they are about 0 97 for the validation period b compared with the measured z h moreover the rmse value is less than 0 32 m for the calibration period and the validation period a but it increases to 0 635 m for the validation period b table 3 in addition the simulation time of the ypwes model was shorter than 10 s in all three periods according to the simulation results the accuracy of the simulated q h decreased by about 0 04 before the impoundment of the tgd but the accuracy of the simulated z h did not significantly change in order to further evaluate the performance of the ypwes model it was used to simulate the q h and z h and the results were compared with the results of nine existing mechanism and statistical models reported in previous studies guo and lai 2020 zhang et al 2019 yao et al 2018 ye et al 2017 huang et al 2017 li et al 2015 li et al 2014 lai et al 2013 nine existing models were selected for the simulation of the hydrodynamic process in the yprls the nse r2 and rmse m values and simulation times of the nine existing models were compared with those of the ypwes model table 4 the results show that the nse and r2 values of the ypwes model are higher than those of the other models from 2003 to 2016 and its rmse value is lower for the same period in addition the ypwes model has a slightly lower r2 value than the bpnn model from 1980 to 1999 ye et al 2017 however the accuracy of the ypwes model is higher than those of the other models during this period except that it has an accuracy which is equivalent to those of the bpnn model li et al 2015 the lstm model guo and lai 2020 and the convolutional hierarchical attention model cham lai et al 2013 particularly for the simulation of the wet year with an extreme flood event 1998 lai et al 2013 the simulation results effectively reflect the variation trends of the peak discharge and peak water level and the relative errors in the peak discharge and peak water level of the simulation are 12 24 and 4 42 respectively fig 6 in addition the simulation results obtained using the ypwes model are more accurate than the simulation results obtained using the cham for a typical dry year 2006 lai et al 2013 the simulation results show that the ypwes model can be used to analyze flood events and dry events consequently the ypwes model is generally more accurate than the nine existing models and is applicable to the simulation of the water exchange in the yprls 4 2 model sensitivity analysis in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the ypwes model parameter sensitivity analysis and initial value sensitivity analysis were conducted with respect to the assessment of the parameter sensitivity each parameter of the ypwes model was varied from 0 5 times to 1 5 times in steps of 0 1 times to reflect the possible values determined by the user only one parameter was changed at any time and the value of the corresponding nse was simulated using the ypwes model fig 7a if the value of the corresponding nse was greater than 0 75 the simulation results are acceptable while the simulation results were good when the value of the corresponding nse was greater than 0 9 according to the nse values corresponding to the varied parameters the changes in the parameters used for correcting the errors did not have a significant impact on the simulation accuracy but the nse value decreased rapidly when the parameters for calculating v z p were changed therefore the parameters for determining v z p have the most significant influence on the simulation while the parameters of the two correction functions g q j z p and g q j q pin have smaller influences on the simulation the initial sensitivity analysis involved q h and z p which are the initial conditions of the ypwes model in order to conduct the analysis the value of each initial condition was varied from 0 5 times to 1 5 times in steps of 0 25 times and the two initial conditions were combined to indicate the different initial discharge ability of poyang lake and the initial water storage in poyang lake for the 24 combinations of the two varied initial conditions q h was simulated using the ypwes model and was compared with the q h simulated using the measured initial conditions fig 7b the simulation results show that the simulation conducted using the ypwes model is divergent if z p is reduced to 0 5 times however the simulation results obtained by the combination initial conditions trend toward those obtained by the unchanged initial conditions within 50 days after the start of the simulation consequently the ypwes model is sufficiently stable to cope with reasonable deviations in the initial values 4 3 distinguishing the bidirectional flow the daily calculated k is obtained simultaneously with the daily measured q h thus a certain variable k corresponds to q h in a day compared with the q h z h relationship the corresponding k z h relationship for the period of 1971 2016 exhibits a more significant linearity because of higher values of r2 as illustrated in fig 8 particularly for the period of 2003 2016 the linearity of k z h relationship still exists when the values of the q h corresponding to k increases in steps of about 1000 m3 s fig 9 furthermore as illustrated in fig 9 scattered points which indicate daily k z h relationships are generally concentrated in specific areas when q h has certain values whilst the k z h relationship exhibits potential hysteresis when q h ranges from 1000 m3 s to 12 000 m3 s specifically scattered points corresponding to the brl event occurrence and lake discharge exceeding15000 m3 s are basically concentrated in the upper left corner and lower right corner respectively fig 9a fig 9q moreover the area occupied by scattered points gradually moves from top left to bottom right with the corresponding q h increases evidently the above characteristics of the k z h relationships are obvious as well for the period of 1971 2002 fig 10 however the movement of areas occupied by scattered points is more complex whilst areas corresponding to the different ranges of q h are more difficult to distinguish the significant linearity of k z h relationship is basis for the adoption of the dif method according to the simulated k and z h from 2003 to 2016 the coefficients of the dif were determined table 5 then as shown in fig 11 the ranges of dif corresponding to the brl event occurrence before and after the impoundment of tgd 2003 are from 8 7 m to 10 5 m and from 9 1 m to 9 9 m respectively while exceeding 85 of the dif values have a range of 9 3 9 9 m before 2003 and 9 3 9 5 m after 2003 in addition 84 51 and 92 17 of the dif values corresponding to the brl event occurrence were obtained for the period of june august before and after 2003 respectively thus the different distributions of dif s values corresponding to the brl event occurrence may lead to two threshold ranges of the dif then two threshold ranges of the dif containing most of its values corresponding to the brl event occurrence were determined that is threshold range a of the dif which was determined adopting data before 2003 has a range of 9 2 10 0 m while threshold range b of the dif has a range of 9 2 9 4 m based on data after 2003 table 5 in order to comprehensively evaluate the performance of different threshold ranges the cognition rate from 1971 to 2002 and from 2003 to 2016was calculated using the threshold range a and threshold range b respectively as illustrated in fig 12 the recognition rate of lake drainage based on threshold range b and threshold range a are approximately over 94 and 78 respectively whilst the recognition rate of brl event occurrence based on threshold range b and threshold range a both exceed 94 overall the recognition rate of these identifications basically exceeds 93 except for the identification of lake drainage before 2003 furthermore based on different threshold ranges the annual frequency of the potential brl event occurrence decreases by 68 30 after 2003 this variation in the potential brl event occurrence reveals the influences of climate and human activities on the water exchange in the yprls li et al 2017 consequently the dif method based on the ypwes model could accurately identify the brl event for a long time period 5 discussion 5 1 model performance to evaluate the performance of the ypwes model the comparison between the ypwes model and nine existing models is conducted accordingly from 2003 to 2016 the simulation results of the ypwes model are more accurate and have a faster simulation efficiency compared with those of the existing models furthermore from 1971 to 2002 the ypwes matched the measured data more consistently when compared with hydrodynamic models mike21 efdc and cham in addition the simulation results show that the ypwes model is useful for simulating flood and dry events moreover regarding the comparisons with statistical models the nse and r2 values of the ypwes obtained simulated results from 1980 to 1999 are about 0 01 lower than that of the bpnn obtained simulated results li et al 2015 however the nse and r2 values of the ypwes obtained simulated results are similar or higher than that of the simulated results obtained by other statistical models additionally after the impoundment of the tgd the nse and r2 values of the ypwes obtained simulated q h are about 0 04 lower which may be due to that the statistical relationships are mainly estimated after the impoundment of the tgd nevertheless two correction functions successfully maintain the stability of the ypwes model ensuring the nse and r2 values of the simulated q h exceed 0 9 except for higher accuracy the simulation time of the ypwes model is within 10 s which is at least two times shorter than that of other statistical models while the ypwes model has a ratio of the calibration period s duration to the validation period s duration which is about 0 2 times and is much smaller than that of other statistical models since a shorter calibration period and a longer validation period usually result in a poorer simulation accuracy the shorter simulation time obviously shows the special advantage of the ypwes model talukder et al 2021 moreover in contrary to that existing statistical models generally just output one hydrological variable the ypwes outputs the discharge and water level simultaneously the shortage of statistical models may due to the distinction between it and physical mechanisms whilst the proposed ypwes model is developed on the base of the lumped framework thereby basically having a better performance than the statistical models overall the ypwes model is generally more accurate and efficient than the other existing models and outputs more simulated hydrological variables which shows the ypwes model is a promising alternative for establishing a basin simulator and predicting dynamics of water exchange in the yprls 5 2 characteristics of the brl event occurrence the ypwes model also helps to distinguish the bidirectional flow as the base of dif method which offers an approach identifying exceeding 93 of the daily brl event s occurrences from 1971 to 2016 compared with the identification of the brl event s occurrence conducted by li et al 2017 the dif method improves the effectivity of identification significantly meanwhile the dif method adopts variables measured in the yprls rather than variables measured outside the yprls huang et al 2017 that is the dif method which aims at providing a more sufficient identification of the occurrence of the brl event just by data measured in the yprls could improve the understanding of the brl event s occurrence indeed the advantage of the dif method is mainly attributed to the regular k z h relationship which is favorable to identify the brl event occurrence by distinguishing the scattered points corresponding to the brl event occurrence from other scattered points as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 in contrast the disordered and nonlinear q h z h relationship makes the analysis and prediction of the brl event occurrence as well as the dynamic of water exchange in the yprls more difficult bing et al 2018 huang et al 2017 li et al 2017 thus the regular k z h relationship may not only help to develop the dif method but also facilitate the study of the water exchange s variation in the yprls furthermore it s notable that though variable k rather than q h has a more significant relationship with z h the algorithm of k mainly derives from the derivation of basic equations of the ypwes model instead of the obvious physical relationship between z p and z h as well as q j and z h thereby representing that the ypwes could help to quantify valuably potential physical relationship between known variables nevertheless the k z h relationship is essentially applied to linearize the q h z h relationship thus they are bound to have similar dynamics after the tgd impounds for example as shown in fig 8 these relationships are both more linear after 2003 meanwhile since the threshold range of the dif s values corresponding to the brl event is smaller after 2003 which implies that the k z h relationship is more ordered after the impoundment of the tgd the q h z h relationship should be more regular after the tgd impounds given that the k z h relationship has similar variation pattern with that of the former it s noteworthy that the q h z h relationship is measured at the conjunction of river and lake thus should be ordered if the influence of the yangtze river forcing is negligible on the contrary the yangtze river streamflow rather than the cipl is the main factor influencing q h when the brl event occurs while z h is closely related to the discharge measured at hankou station which is located at the yangtze river s mainstream yao et al 2018 huang et al 2017 gao et al 2014 thus it is the yangtze river streamflow which is the primary factor leading to the change of q h z h relationship when the brl event occurs it may be due to the yangtze river streamflow is significantly reduced after the impoundment of the tgd that the period where q h z h relationship becomes more regular coincides with the impoundment of the tgd yang et al 2016 gao et al 2013 that is the q h z h relationship corresponding to the brl event occurrence changes with the yangtze river streamflow 5 3 limitations and future research the ypwes model was demonstrated to be stable in terms of simulating the water exchange in the yprls the initial condition analysis shows that the initial z p should exceed 6 81 m while the actual z p from 1971 to 2016 exceeds about 9 m which implies the requirements of the input conditions are generally met nevertheless the storage capacity curve of the poyang lake is estimated to be a continuous and single valued function in contrary to which the hysteresis of storage stage relationship of the poyang lake makes the storage capacity curve much more complex liu et al 2020 yao et al 2018 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 gao et al 2014 although the simulation error caused by the estimated storage capacity curve is corrected by the two constructed correction functions more work is required to improve the ypwes model first the coupling of the impacts from the wind forcing and underwater topography which results in a more comprehensive assessment of the water exchange in the yprls should be considered yao et al 2019 yao et al 2018 then basic equations which are based on the physical mechanism could be used to simplify the ypwes model finally the estimation of the storage capacity curve of the poyang lake can be improved moreover the ypwes model could not only produce an accurate and efficient simulation of water exchange in the yprls which is a typical river lake systems across the globe but also be employed for simulating water exchange in other river networks and river lake systems specifically the ypwes model is based on a lumped framework which is essentially a one dimensional river network and could be constructed easily then based on the lumped framework if the discharge stage relationship can be accurately estimated and the water budget process can be effectively quantified using the water balance principle the four basic equations can be derived and adopted to establish the ypwes model 6 conclusions in this study a novel statistical model was developed to generate an accurate and efficient assessment of the variation in the water exchange in the yprls based on a lumped framework the ypwes model improves the accuracy of simulation and reduces the necessary computational resources for simulation when compared with nine existing models moreover the ypwes model could quantify and evaluate the relationships between the water exchange and the potential influencing factors in the yprls employing the ypwes model it was found that the thresholds of dif which have ranges of 9 3 9 6 m and of 9 2 10 0 m respectively can be used to identify more than 93 of the bwl and lake drainage occurrence thus the threshold range of the dif corresponding to the brl event occurrence was smaller after 2003 because the discharge stage relationship at hukou station when the brl event occurs is more regular mainly due to the change of the yangtze river due to its accuracy and efficiency the ypwes could improve the understanding of the response of water exchange to the climate change and human activities additionally since the connection with physical mechanism he ypwes model helps to systematically quantify and assess the new statistical relationships between the variables in the yprls furthermore the ypwes model can be utilized as a module in a simulator to provide the boundary conditions of hydrodynamic models consequently the developed ypwes model would be a valuable fundamental tool of improving the quantification and understanding of the water exchange s dynamic in the yprls or other river lake system

no 2021385 and the central guidance on local science and technology development fund of chongqing city no 2021000069 appendix a according to eq 1 q h is related to the difference between the water levels at hukou station and that in the lake area thus the water level at hukou station z h m can be estimated as follows a 1 z h f q h z p c a z p b q h c z p 2 d z p q h the difference between the water level at hukou station and that at jiujiang station also have a relationship with q h the water level at jiujiang station can be approximately replaced by a function of the discharge at jiujiang station then another estimation equation for z h can be constructed a 2 z h f q h q j c a q j b q h c q j 2 d q j q h eqs a 1 and a 2 indicate that z h is related to q h q j and z p so z h can be estimated using q h q j and z p a 3 z h c 1 a 1 q j b 1 q h c 1 z p d 1 q j 2 e 1 q h 2 f 1 z p 2 g 1 q j q h h 1 z p q h the least square method is used to determine the coefficients of eq a 3 and that in the following derivation in addition z h can also be estimated using q pin and q j fan 2019 a 4 z h c a ln q j b ln q p i n moreover eqs a 1 and a 2 can be combined to determine the relationship between q h and other variables a 5 q h c 2 a 2 q j b 2 z h c 2 z p d 2 z p 2 e 2 z p q h f 2 q j 2 g 2 q j q h eq a 5 can be simplified into an iterative equation eq a 6 by considering the estimation error ε a 6 q h ε f q h c e 2 z p q h g 2 q j q h c k q h where the terms without q h are treated as a constant c whilst k is the coefficient of the combined term containing q h using an appropriate value of k could make eq a 5 an accurate method for simulating q h thus an iteration is conducted on q h ε once and is added to eq a 6 thus a 7 q h f q h ε f q h 2 k ε 2 because the values of f q h and f q h ε are calculated using eq a 5 which are fixed on a day q h can be accurately simulated if k 2 however according to values of the measured variables which were used to calculate k the value of k varies from 0 574 to 1 214 therefore q h cannot be accurately simulated using the iterative equation because the simulation error will become more significant as the iteration progresses when k 2 a 8 q h 1 3 ε f q h 1 3 c eq a 8 is the form of eq a 6 when the accurate simulation of q h is obtained comparing the terms in eqs a 6 and a 8 it s obvious that terms containing q h are removed from the estimation equations of q h to simulate q h accurately since the cipl has a primary influence on q h a new method for simulating q h can be developed by removing the terms containing q h after combining eqs a 1 a 2 and a 4 fan 2018 a 9 q h c 3 a 3 q j b 3 z h c 3 z p d 3 ln q j e 3 ln q p i n f 3 z p 2 g 3 q j 2 as reflected by eqs a 5 and a 9 q h is influenced by the combination of several influencing factors mainly consisting of the coupling of q j and z h and that of z p and z h meanwhile according to eqs a 1 and a 2 the responses of q h to these couplings represent the impacts from the poyang lake forcing and the yangtze river forcing on q h respectively thus the offsetting of two couplings effects on q h indicates the difference between the influence of the yangtze river forcing and that of poyang lake forcing on q h which would make the influence of z h on q h negligible thereby providing a new approach to simulate q h by a function of z p and q j as following a 10 q h f q j z p c 4 a 4 q j b 4 z p c 4 q j 2 d 4 z p q j e 4 z p 2 eqs a 10 and a 9 provide two methods for simulating q h which obtain simulation results q h1 and q h2 respectively q h2 is more accurate than q h1 because of the involvement of the cipl however the hysteresis of storage stage relationship of the poyang lake and the water level gradient in the lake area which appears in the dry season introduce significant simulation errors into q h1 and q h2 yao et al 2018 huang et al 2017 gao et al 2014 therefore the simulated errors in eqs a 9 and a 10 are influenced by the system state of the yprls q j q pin z p and z h and can be mediated by the correction functions which preferentially adopted at least two measured variables in eqs a 9 and a 10 thus the measured q j and simulated z p were used to construct the correction functions for eq a 10 while the measured q j and q pin were used to construct the correction functions for eq a 9 which obtains eq a 11 and eq a 12 respectively thus a 11 q h 1 c f q h 1 g q j z p c 5 a 5 q h 1 b 5 q j c 5 z p d 5 q j 2 e 5 z p 2 f 5 q j z p a 12 q h 2 c f q h 2 g q j q p i n c 6 a 6 q h 2 b 6 q j c 6 q p i n d 6 q j 2 e 6 q p i n 2 f 6 q j q p i n where the subscript c denotes that the simulated q h has been corrected eq 2 indicates that the daily change in z p z p is influenced by the daily change of v if the daily changes of v and z p approximately exhibit as linear process then a 13 δ v δ z p v t δ t z p t δ t v z p a 14 δ z p δ v v z p q p i n q h δ t v z p subsequently a recursion method is adopted for simulating z p and can be combined with the simulation of q h using the ypwes model a 15 z p z p δ z p z p δ v v z p z p q p i n q h c 7 a 7 z p b 7 z p 2 where v z p is the key to the recursion method and is assumed to have the form of a quadratic function the coefficients of eq a 15 are estimated by datasets which consist of the measured q h estimated q pin and measured z p however thousands of datasets are available for determining coefficients in eq a 15 while these datasets will introduce errors in the coefficient estimations at certain extent in addition the hysteresis of v z p relationship makes it difficult to obtain accurate estimated coefficients in order to overcome above problems a screening process was developed to identify datasets with negligible errors fig a1 first the coefficients for simulating v z p are estimated using initial datasets then the estimated v z p is adopted by the ypwes model to simulate z p if the accuracy of the simulated z p is high enough the estimated v z p is acceptable for the ypwes model otherwise the simulated z p denoted as zp1is obtained by eq a 15 the two methods for simulating z p are both based on eq a 15 while q h simulated by eq a 12 and measured q h are adopted by the ypwes model and other methods respectively subsequently z p1 is used to replace the measured z p to renew the datasets and is substituted into eq a 5 to replace initial z p in its linear term therefore the value of q h calculated by eq a 5 will be changed thus the absolute value of this change is calculated as follows a 16 δ q h c 2 z p 1 z p eq a 5 has a similar form with eqs a 9 and a 10 while leads to higher estimation accuracy od q h thus in accordance with the given threshold of abs δq h eq a 5 is used to identify z p1 which is similar with the measured z p in addition the product of δv and the simulated δz p should be positive if the renewed daily dataset meets these two criteria it will be retained otherwise it will be removed subsequently the coefficients of eq a 15 are re estimated using the screened datasets beginning with eq a 15 which contains the re estimated coefficients a new round of screening is conducted until an accurate simulated z p is obtained the recommended threshold of abs δq h is 1 10 based on experience appendix b supporting information supplementary data associated with this

groundwater and climate change studies began to be more widely published in peer reviewed journals after the release of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fourth assessment report in

significant earman and dettinger 2011 taylor et al 2013 tillman et al 2020 unesco ihp 2015 therefore a sound understanding of how climate change will impact groundwater is crucial to predict how

3 impacts of climate change on groundwater it appears that climate change is impacting groundwater in two main ways directly by affecting replenishment through rr and indirectly by climate induced

changes in rr atawneh et al 2021 and in the intensity of hydrochemical processes aladejana et al 2020 moore and joye 2021 the mechanisms involved in rr groundwater storage and flow are complex they involve interactions between the hydrological and energy cycles with feedback processes occurring between groundwater and the atmosphere in different parts of the world smerdon 2017 land cover types and particularly the presence of vegetation impervious surfaces and human induced activities e g groundwater abstraction managed aquifer recharge irrigation also impact the hydrological processes li et al 2021 untangling the effects of climate change from human disturbance and natural climate variability makes it challenging to resolve influences of driving forces and the mechanisms involved douville et al 2021 lehner et al 2020 sarojini et al 2016 there is additional complexity from long residence times in groundwater systems ranging from days to thousands of years and the associated time lags between a given climate event or human induced activity and the response of the groundwater systems green 2016 2 4 assessing and predicting the effects of climate change on groundwater monitoring and modelling are the two core approaches used to assess and predict groundwater changes and any effects of climate change earman and dettinger 2011 a common prerequisite to predict these effects is to sufficiently understand the geology and hydrogeology of the systems dragoni and sukhija 2008 this understanding covers for instance characterisation of the geological formations water bearing horizons aquifers geometry and hydraulic properties long term multi decades groundwater level records can be statistically analysed to infer natural variability anthropogenic influences and broader impacts of climate change park et al 2011 data on rainfall variability land use change and groundwater abstraction are required to fully elucidate effects directly related to climate change anbar et al 2020 advances in hydrograph analysis filtering and processing algorithms have allowed substantial progress in hydrological monitoring time series analysis haas and birk 2019 environmental isotope based approaches such as carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of groundwater have been used for several decades to infer paleoclimates dragoni and sukhija 2008 jiang et al 2019 yang and wang 2020 more recently remotely sensed data have started to supplement in situ monitoring networks in particular grace gravimetry data can inform groundwater storage changes within regional aquifer systems zuo et al 2021 predictions of climate change induced effects on groundwater are mostly derived from physically based modelling approaches with a wide range of model complexity e g processes and parameters included scales from local to global and level of integration with other models kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 moeck et al 2016 mustafa et al 2019 characterisation of uncertainty associated with these model predictions is essential to inform risk based decisions including adaptation holman et al 2012 lehner et al 2020 and is increasingly being incorporated into modelling atawneh et al 2021 the uncertainty of groundwater predictions under climate change is often considerable douville et al 2021 smerdon 2017 and conditioned mainly by choice of the gcms the downscaling methods applied and the hydro geo logical models crosbie et al 2013 earman and dettinger 2011 mustafa et al 2019 in the absence of system specific knowledge analogues between intensively studied groundwater systems and poorly characterised systems with similar hydrological conditions can be used to assess potential impacts from climate change green et al 2011 this approach may become increasingly relevant with the global effort to assess climate change effects on groundwater systems in areas with insufficient resources to inform adaptation unesco ihp 2015 2 5 mitigation adaptation and resilience to climate change threats 2 5 1 definitions and background in the ipcc ar5 climate change adaptation and mitigation are described as complementary strategies for reducing and managing the risks of climate change pachauri et al 2014 mitigation is defined as a human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases and adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects ipcc 2014 the paris agreement has strengthened mitigation and the glasgow climate pact financial support for adaptation un climate change conference 2021 united nations 2015 adaptation needs and capacity vary among regions countries and socio economic groups and will also vary over time countries and communities that are the most vulnerable are exposed to the highest climate change induced risks and have the slightest capacity to adapt due to limited resources klein et al 2014 mitigation aims to address global long term issues while adaptation focuses on solving local short term problems pasimeni et al 2019 interactions between these strategies and how to efficiently use them still need to be explored pittock et al 2016 sharifi 2021 both mitigation and adaptation are utilised to enhance resilience to climate change threats see below resilience being defined as the capacity of social economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function identity and structure while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation learning and transformation ipcc 2014 2 5 2 nz approach the nz government recently agreed on a national framework to drive climate change policy towards low ghg emissions and a climate resilient nation new zealand cabinet office 2020 the climate change response zero carbon amendment act new zealand parliament 2019 provides a series of domestic emission reduction targets including reduction of net ghg emissions except biogenic methane to zero by 2050 the first emissions reduction plan erp to be published by december 2021 will complement this act by describing methods to meet these targets ministry for the environment 2021a in parallel an independent climate change commission ccc established in december 2019 advises the government on climate change mitigation and adaptation measures the ccc will also monitor progress towards the target emissions budgets and on the implementation of a national adaptation plan nap scheduled for 2022 ministry for the environment 2021a the nap aims to characterise and respond to national climate change risks and guide regional and local adaptation actions it will be informed by the first national climate change risk assessment nccra august 2020 its translation for local governments and the actual regional assessments ministry for the environment 2019 2020a 2021b learnings from early climate change adaptation actions are starting to emerge for instance a case study addressing coastal erosion in hawke s bay highlighted the uncertainty about the roles of central and local authorities as one of the main challenges ministry for the environment and hawke s bay regional council partnership project 2020 2 5 3 adaptation for groundwater resilience groundwater will play a critical role in adapting to a changing climate as aquifers are more resilient to hydrological changes than surface water bodies and buffer seasonal changes in temperature and rainfall they can store large volumes of water during large rainfall events release water during drier periods limit evaporative loss and preserve water quality clifton et al 2010 the design of adaptation measures necessitates the understanding of processes and projected changes on the groundwater resources and highlights the importance of monitoring to be more effective time horizons to plan groundwater management and develop adaptation policies need to be significantly shorter than the actual climate change projections i e for the next 10 20 years rather than the next 50 100 years such shorter timeframes will enable resource managers to integrate new knowledge gained through monitoring and modelling to the adaptation policies see discussion these shorter timeframes will also ensure that considered land uses and soil conditions still represent the existing as they will presumably change as the communities adapt to the climate conditions smerdon 2017 3 material and methods the applied methodology utilises pre existing national and regional datasets and models to project climate change induced effects in regional groundwater systems the sub national scale was used as mesoscale approach to reduce uncertainty and provides valuable insights for resource management smerdon 2017 an initial literature review led to the identification of nz regions for which recent climate change projections were established two case study regions were then selected hawke s bay and otago for i

north and south islands fig 1 two climate change pathways utilised by the nccra framework were applied to explore the effects of climate change on groundwater fig 2 stabilisation rcp4 5 and high

kaimanawa ranges in the west to the pacific ocean in the east the regional climate is largely influenced by the orography and predominantly western airstreams crossing nz appendix a1 hawke s bay is sunny and less windy than other nz coastal areas and has highly variable and sporadic rainfall and very variable temperatures frequent dry spells deplete soil moisture and prevent plant growth

largest changes occurring in particular seasons rather than annually the percentage of time spent in climatic drought is anticipated to increase fedaeff 2017 most of the region s groundwater resources are hosted in large aquifers systems located in the plains i e the heretaunga plains the ruataniwha plains and the northern coastal aquifer systems the hydrogeology of these systems is complex due to

respectively increases in mean annual temperatures and in mean annual rainfall are anticipated in the future table 1 rainfall changes vary spatially and seasonally in the region with the most significant changes projected for particular seasons rather than annually more extreme rare rainfall events and larger floods are also predicted macara et al 2019 regional groundwater resources are mainly located in disconnected basins that often contain multiple aquifers only a few large aquifers are present in otago heller 2001 most of the aquifers are unconfined and hosted in quaternary outwash deposits in recent alluvial gravel or more rarely in volcanic formations more complex semi confined aquifers are found in the tertiary formations heller 2001 groundwater abstraction is the fourth largest of the country based on the maximum annual consented volume of c 183 m m3 for the 2017 2018 reporting year stats nz 2020a several catchments are over allocated for water quantity in otago with rivers that can run dry locally e g north and central otago in central otago this is often due to water rights attached to historic mining permits subsequently used for irrigation

canterbury region its irrigated land area increased from 60 678 ha to 99 687 ha between 2002 and 2019 stats nz 2019 3 2 datasets and models national datasets and models provided underpinning data for this study to develop a replicable methodology to other nz regions table 2 fig 2 current climate conditions were informed by the virtual climate station network vcsn tait et al 2006 that provides daily precipitation and penman potential evapotranspiration pet onwards data from 1960 to the present day for nz in a regular grid 0 05 of latitude and longitude or c 5 km the nz river environment classification ministry for the environment 2010 was also utilised to investigate climate and groundwater changes in a selection of large regional river catchments similarly the hydrogeological system classification of moreau et al 2019 table 2 was used to delineate regional groundwater systems the national groundwater recharge model ngrm westerhoff et al 2018b is a nationwide soil water balance model calculating gross rr it was inspired by the watergap model döll and fiedler 2008 with the addition of improved nationwide datasets e g soil map vcsn rainfall and satellite derived actual evapotranspiration data et onwards in this study the ngrm was used to produce annual and seasonal projections of rr for our climate change scenarios the national water table model nwt westerhoff et al 2018a is a steady state groundwater flow model that calculates water table elevation wte onwards it was developed by improving a global scale model fan et al 2013 and feeding in national input data of nz terrain geology and rr and by slight adjustment of model parametrisation the nwt was developed as a solution to obtain a nationwide overview of groundwater that bridges the gap between the too expensive advanced local models and the too simple global scale models westerhoff et al 2018a the nwt was coupled to the ngrm to calculate projections of wte for our climate change scenarios these wte projections were annual and not seasonal as the nwt calculates the long term steady state wte the ngrm and nwt models were informed by regional data including niwa downscaled projections of mean annual and seasonal precipitation and temperature fedaeff 2017 macara et al 2019 pearce 2021 woolley 2021 table 2 both these models were designed to estimate historical values but are deemed suitable to include climate scenarios see discussion section 5 2 3 3 3 data processing 3 3 1 preparation of climate change datasets for each scenario niwa climate change projections are defined as seasonal change forecasts of precipitation change in and mean temperature change in c per season for each scenario the three months of each season were changed with the projected seasonal change value for the same spatial data grid as vcsn additional vcsn attributes were added for precipitation and temperature changes and named pscenario tmin scenario and tmax scenario respectively earlier research showed that pet both fao56 et0 and penman pet is dominantly sensitive to temperature followed by solar radiation relative humidity and cloudiness and therefore can be expressed as a function of temperature westerhoff 2015 with this function we estimated i a hypothetical current pet pethypothetical current using vcsn tmin and tmax values and ii a hypothetical pet for all climate change scenarios pethypothetical scenario using projected temperature change the difference in pet between current climate and climate scenarios δpet eq 1 was then defined as 1 δpet pethypothetical scenario pethypothetical current δpet was then extrapolated to the satellite pet eq 2 and et eq 3 as an input into the recharge model for each scenario 2 petscenario petsatellite δpet 3 etscenario etsatellite δpet the same value of δpet was used to adjust et estimates uncertainties associated with these assumptions are discussed in section 5 2 3 3 3 2 p et rr and wte projections mean annual p et calculations were undertaken for each scenario the ngrm was used to estimate mean seasonal and mean annual rr with input datasets for current climate and future climate scenarios fig 2 the nwt model was then run with the current and future rr climate change scenario from the ngrm and produced annual wte outputs rr and wte comparisons were made for the two case study regions statistics and maps of change in p et δ p et were produced for large regional surface water catchments and aquifers for each case study region changes in rr and wte δrr and δwte respectively were summarised in maps and statistics for the hydrogeological systems defined by moreau et al 2019 with the exception of basement rock hydrogeological systems fig 1 and table 2 and are referred to as aquifers select bore data was also utilised to investigate projected δwte where groundwater is abstracted for example in otago the bores with reliable water level data complete metadata and described as utilised were selected δwte was expressed in relation to the easting coordinate of the bores as both regions have ranges in the west and coastal plains in the east we defined our reference or current period to express changes i e δ p et δrr and δwte as 2000 2015 further explanations are provided in the discussion section 5 2 3 4 results 4 1 p et projections in general δ p et for both study regions is projected to decrease from the current climate conditions to future climate conditions rcp 4 5 and 8 5 mid and end century scenarios fig 3 annual median δ p et values are projected to decrease for both regions with the most significant reductions greater than 50 for the rcp 8 5 end century scenario annual 25 and 75 percentile data indicate more contrasted local changes with dominantly reduced δ p et values for hawke s bay and more variable results for otago ranging from δ p et reductions to increases seasonal projections also indicate some variability in seasonal trends and amplitudes of change in both regions median δ p et is projected to increase in summer and decrease in autumn however δ p et in winter is projected to reduce in hawke s bay but increase in otago the 25 75 percentile δ p et range varies between seasons as relative i e changes become more apparent in dryer seasons projections of δ p et also show important spatial variability for both regions suggesting for instance the influence of the orography figs 4 and 5 δ p et is projected to increase the most in the west of hawke s bay and otago where the highest mountain ranges are located 4 2 rr projections δrr is projected to decrease over the century in both regions under all climate projections with rcp8 5 scenario having the largest changes fig 6 δrr projections differ with regions hawke s bay is expected to have a general overall δrr reduction fig 7 current rr in appendix a2 and otago to have more spatial variability fig 8 current rr in appendix a2 in hawke s bay δrr is projected to decrease the most in the west for all seasons but winter in winter δrr reductions are more widespread in the region with values up to approximately 1 5 mm day except for a few limited extent areas where δrr increases are projected e g north west in otago δrr increases of up to 0 4 mm day are projected in the west south and east and δrr decreases reaching 0 4 mm day in central otago fig 8 4 3 wte projections annual δwte projections indicate clear changes associated with our future climate scenarios fig 9 current wte in appendix a3 in hawke s bay δwte is projected to be significantly negative with some areas having values reaching 10 m by the end century under rcp8 5 δwte in large coastal and river plains where most aquifers are situated is generally less significant than δwte for aquifers located in narrow and higher elevation inland valleys otago is projected to have more minor amplitude variations of δwte than hawke s bay with positive values in the west south and east and negative values in central otago however for certain otago aquifers locally projections indicate water table declines up to several metres e g for aquifers located in the driest areas of the upper clutha and taieri river catchments see section 4 5 4 4 combined results for regional surface water catchments and aquifers in general individual surface water catchments follow the regional trends of δ p et δrr and δwte however some local variability is also projected table 3 figs 10 and 11 4 4 1 change in p et in both regions δ p et reductions are usually more pronounced for aquifers than surface water catchments in hawke s bay the median changes in δ p et point to general water availability reductions with climate change for the case study river catchments and aquifers the largest reductions are projected in the ngaruroro and tukituki river catchments in otago δ p et reductions are particularly marked for the taieri river catchment which has its headwaters located in the driest area of nz interestingly the kakanui river catchment otago displays a different trend despite δ p et decreases in the surface water catchment in which headwaters are also located in an arid area δ p et increases are projected for the aquifers situated near the coast 4 4 2 change in rr δrr projections generally follow the δ p et projection trends for the aquifers with smaller δrr percentages than δ p et percentages exceptionally opposite trends are projected for the pomahaka river catchment otago with δ p et reductions and δrr increases for the aquifers trends of δ p et and δrr do not necessarily have to go in the same direction because i subsurface drainage properties also control rr and ii the ngrm resolution is much finer than the area of the whole river catchments and aquifers investigated for which the median of the data was used in addition small differences as projected for the pomahaka river catchment can be amplified when expressed as percentages of change the most considerable δrr reductions are projected for aquifers located in the tukituki river catchment hawke s bay and the manuherekia and ida catchments otago significant increases are also anticipated for the kakanui river catchment otago 4 4 3 change in wte δwte is projected to change the most for end century scenarios with a majority of decreases table 3 and the largest decreases projected for aquifers located in the ngaruroro and mohaka river catchments hawke s bay rare δwte increases are however projected in otago with the largest rises projected for the aquifers located in the kakanui river catchment 4 5 wte change and bores in the previous section table 3 figs 10 and 11 we presented δwte projections expressed as median δwte values for the different aquifers located in a surface water catchment alternatively we also calculated δwte projections at the location of existing and used bores these latter results give maximum changes up to c 9 m in hawke s bay and to 5 m in otago fig 12 in the ngaruroro river catchment hawke s bay δwte projections at bore locations indicate more pronounced reductions for the inland or upper catchment bores in the west compared to the coastal or lower catchment bores in the east in otago δwte values suggest the largest increases for the bores located in the west along the southern alps and east along the coast and general reductions for central otago bores the pomahaka river catchment bores have a central easting but are located south otago where δwte projections show increases 5 discussion the climate change pathway that the world will take to 2100 is unclear for some rcp 2 6 low co2 future is possible in 2021 there is a 50 chance that humankind can attain this future with a rapid change in global co2 generation i e 50 per decade cumulative between 2020 and 2050 figueres and rivett carnac 2021 however global fossil fuel co2 generation in the 2000 2020 period possibly points to a high co2 future that is more like rcp 8 5 and to the difficulty of attaining the paris agreement i e keeping global average temperature well within 2 c above pre industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1 5 c united nations 2015 for example the 2000 2020 period saw world cumulative increase in the population of approximately 13 per decade united nations 2019 and co2 generation from fossil fuels of approximately 16 per decade worldometer 2021 within this period growth in energy use from fossil fuel sources is still outpacing the rise of low carbon sources and activities jackson et al 2018 building resilience would appear as the appropriate climate change strategy given uncertainties in future human response to climate change and in scientific predictions of the effects i e amplitude timing and location of climate change on groundwater resources this discussion aims to assist groundwater managers and users by considering scientific evidence including limitations and uncertainty as relevant to the decision making process identifying the unique effects of climate change on groundwater and adaptation to climate change 5 1 groundwater and climate change furthering the science our projections of change in rr and wte suggest different trends across the two case study regions and between otago catchments these differences are mainly driven by the climate projections used by our groundwater models and fedaeff 2017 and macara et al 2019 some aquifers are projected to receive less rr and show decreasing wte which is a general trend projected in hawke s bay and some central otago river catchments conversely other aquifers are projected to have increased rr and wte in specific catchments of otago e g kakanui and kawarau river catchments the general trends in our results i e already very dry areas getting drier e g central otago and already wet areas getting wetter e g otago s kawarau river catchment are inferred to be transposable to the rest of nz the science of groundwater and climate change will be furthered by i addressing the incomplete knowledge and data associated with groundwater systems and ii better climate change predictions therefore there is now some urgency to these science needs due to nz wide implications of this study and the importance of the period 2020 2050 in the earth s climate change future see below 5 1 1 improved local knowledge and data at the catchment scale knowledge limitations include uncertainties with the geometry and properties of the flow system and climate influenced water budget elements such as groundwater use groundwater use is often available as maximum allocated amounts in nz and therefore not representative of actual withdrawn volumes systematic metering of groundwater use only recently a mandatory requirement ministry for the environment 2020c will greatly benefit model data inputs in both our case study regions some aquifers provide large amounts of groundwater for irrigation e g heretaunga aquifer in the ngaruroro river catchment hawke s bay improved knowledge of actual groundwater use will therefore help maintain sustainable allocation limits especially for aquifers where reduced rr and wte are projected e g which is the case of aquifers located in the ngaruroro river catchment land use projections and the timing of change e g land use land cover and growing season duration are also uncertain and will influence rr and water use 5 1 2 improved groundwater models the ngrm and nwt models produced rr and wte projections associated with climate change for our case study regions this approach shows the benefits of these first assessments to groundwater resource management however these models do not account for all processes affecting the groundwater resources and point to the need to integrate groundwater abstraction data surface water groundwater interaction and potential effects of rising seas for coastal aquifers all these additional processes are important in our case study regions and nationwide in addition groundwater modelling typically does not account for the projected increases in rainfall duration and intensity and storm frequency even with a daily time step kendon et al 2014 increases in rainfall intensity will also likely impact soil erosion soil properties and rr processes burt et al 2015 leading to increased run off and reduced water available for rr in response groundwater modelling will need to assume variability in the physical properties of a landscape including rainfall intensity soil properties and land use many of the processes within groundwater systems are largely driven by rr so an improved understanding of these processes and how they will be modified is critical to understanding the effects of climate change on groundwater however climate models produce varying predictions of rr hughes et al 2021 typically rr is calculated by numerical models as in this paper because rr can be difficult to measure directly anderson et al 2015 this generally means that modelled rr is not verified by observations atawneh et al 2021 however rr observations have played a key role in rr model development e g hong et al 2005 mourot et al 2019 white et al 2003 likely observations will play an essential role in the future e g assessment of unsaturated zone processes that are influenced by climate change 5 2 uncertainty and climate change uncertainties associated with climate change are relevant to potential adaptation strategies as decision makers consider future risks associated with the groundwater resource following atawneh et al 2021 the uncertainty of our methodology includes i the earth s climate change pathway in the 21st century ii climate models i e global and regional downscaled models including climate observations used for climate predictions and iii rr models 5 2 1 pathways the actual future pathway of the earth s climate depends on societal decisions e g population economic strategic and political upward pressure on future co2 generation is provided by the increase in the world population of approximately 40 to 2100 united nations 2019 most of this increase will be in emerging countries and will increase specific co2 emissions as it has occurred in china and india since 2000 jackson et al 2018 however political pressure on economies to decarbonise may counter the above pressures certainly the world is seeking alternatives to fossil fuels and we have to be optimistic that affordable alternatives to fossil fuels will be developed increasingly the role of regulation will come to the fore the difficult challenge to keep the world on the 2 c pathway foreshadows more aggressive future energy and economic policies to meet any co2 emission targets sharma et al 2019 the world is now within the period 2020 2050 a decisive interval for 2100 climate outcomes according to figueres and rivett carnac 2021 5 2 2 global models regional models and uncertainty the ability of models to represent observed data is a strong indicator of the quality of model predictions therefore the quality of observed data is a key concern to climate modelling gcms are generally improving over time with increased computer power more observational data and advances in our understanding of climate processes eyring and gillett 2021 however gcms are too coarse to represent catchment scale processes adequately and thus dynamical or statistical downscaling is needed see review this downscaling process may introduce significant local and regional scale uncertainty the uncertainty of model projections is perhaps of primary concern to science users macara et al 2019 project a mean global increase in the otago temperatures for the end of the century with a near doubling of temperatures in rcp8 5 relative to rcp4 5 appendix a4 this comparison highlights the importance of future climate pathways 5 2 3 rr models and uncertainty uncertainty in rr calculated with the ngrm averaged 17 nz mean annual in the period 2000 2015 westerhoff et al 2018b this uncertainty was computed by propagating uncertainty of model inputs i e precipitation evapotranspiration soil properties terrain and geology into the rr calculation the uncertainty in evapotranspiration calculation as used in the ngrm can range from 10 to 40 and is most sensitive to temperature westerhoff 2015 sensitivity testing of the nwt model westerhoff 2018a supplement showed that nominal variations in groundwater elevation were 10 m in the foothills of coastal hawke s bay aquifers and 3 m in coastal otago aquifers in response to a variation 20 of mean recharge climate scenario calculations in this study include additional uncertainties i e beyond those of westerhoff et al 2018b and westerhoff 2015 the ngrm and niwa model projections use different baseline periods i e 2000 2015 as satellite evapotranspiration data is unavailable before 2000 and 1986 2006 respectively however mean values of precipitation and temperature for the two different periods are comparable i e the differences in precipitation were 0 and 3 for hawke s bay and otago respectively and we assume these are within the uncertainty range of evapotranspiration data additional uncertainty is introduced by the use of the temperature pet relation to estimating changes in pet and et and the extrapolation that et changes with the same rate as pet this uncertainty is likely to be small as we relied on the existing satellite data et estimates and their extrapolated rates of change to estimate change given that comprehensive pet calculations have uncertainties of 10 40 and et uncertainties are likely higher we found the unknown but likely smaller uncertainty acceptable the uncertainty of rr will be greater in future climate scenarios because the ngrm calculations include niwa climate projections for example ngrm rr uncertainty will be larger than westerhoff et al 2018b because of uncertainties in future evapotranspiration which includes future temperature projections seasonal extremes are important in this paper s analysis of future climate impacts the seasonal information in the climate projections of our case studies did not contain events that were more extreme than those modelled by westerhoff et al 2018b and westerhoff 2015 therefore we assume that uncertainties in seasonal extreme calculations of this paper are likely to be similar to these published results 5 3 untangling the effects of climate change land use and groundwater management this study has researched climate induced impacts on rr and wte because they are often under represented and less quantified in nz studies however other human induced drivers also impact groundwater such as land use change water demand and protection restoration of receiving environments white and close 2016 5 3 1 effects of different scale policies human induced drivers influence long term climate change but more urgently they cause more immediate effects than climate variability for example dry events affect groundwater depletion mainly due to amplified groundwater withdrawals for agriculture falkenmark and lannerstad 2005 taylor et al 2013 wada et al 2010 the effect of groundwater abstraction on saline intrusion is also magnitudes larger than the effect of sea level rise ferguson and gleeson 2012 yu and michael 2019 catchment scale policies related to water or land use could counteract national scale long term policies developed for adaptation for instance catchment scale water management regulations often address the more immediate issues allowing more water abstraction in drier summers or pumping and draining water out in wetter times in low lying coastal areas for immediate flood control these activities combined with large scale land use changes such as dam construction deforestation or wetland drainage for agriculture haddeland et al 2014 robertson et al 2018 stats nz 2018 could amplify the climate induced depletion effects land impacted by human activity responds differently to climate variability e g with changes in streamflow evapotranspiration or discharge to sea compared to undisturbed ecosystems hosseini moghari et al 2020 taylor et al 2013 5 3 2 separation of climate driven impacts and human induced impacts the layman might easily confuse the effects of climate change on groundwater systems with the effects of human induced change this confusion arises because the links between climate and groundwater resources are clouded by modern day land use change for example decreases in rainfall due to climate change and the conversion of native grasslands to water intensive crops may both contribute to rr reductions in addition the effect of climate mitigation measures on the water cycle e g reduced stream flows in catchments afforested for carbon sequestration adds further complexity douville et al 2021 point to the importance and complexity of distinguishing climate variability from anthropogenic impacts in the water cycle however studies typically address only parts of this complexity e g confirming correlation to human actions and calculating water demand components at the global scale albarakat et al 2018 taylor et al 2013 wada et al 2012 5 3 3 possible paths forward from this study to untangle complexities our results e g δ p et and δrr and δwte projections for the pomahaka river catchment section 4 4 indicate that our analyses can be performed at even finer scale than the river catchments and aquifer areas utilised in our case studies if deemed useful for water management this study starts bottom up in solving these abovementioned complexities by a better spatial quantification of climate induced components on groundwater by providing data in multiple forms and views as initial tools for policymakers and water managers we hope this will form input in developing more complex subsequent tools including better linkages to human induced effects inspiration for these tools can be drawn from recent model studies at local and global scales haddeland et al 2014 wu et al 2020 yifru et al 2021 however the collaboration between key stakeholders at both catchment and national scales to provide policymakers tools is a more fundamental and possible more significant challenge 5 4 climate change adaptation climate change threats i e more frequent droughts and floods melting of glaciers and rising sea levels are already present in nz regions ministry for the environment and stats nz 2020 in addition this study points to scarcer groundwater resources e g in the tukituki and ngaruroro river catchments in hawke s bay in the manuherekia and ida catchments in otago reduced groundwater availability would likely impact the local communities and the environment e g by providing less water for irrigation and less baseflow to support stream ecological health in contrast increased rr and wte e g kakanui river catchment in otago could lead to shallower water tables and favour inundations impacting communities and infrastructure adaptation of the current groundwater management practices is therefore necessary and climate change resilience to such threats requires resource managers and communities to adapt and strategically re think current practices foster et al 2019 three main types of adaptation actions are discussed hereafter for implementation in nz regions i structural and physical ii institutional and iii social adaptation actions noble et al 2014 5 4 1 structural and physical select land uses and engineering techniques our results indicate aquifer areas where wte is projected to decrease further work would confirm the risk of running dry for shallow bores located in these areas jasechko and perrone 2021 in the affected areas the drilling of deeper bores where possible would then help adapt to lower wte conversely higher wte is projected in some locations with a potential increased inundation hazard especially for coastal aquifers under the pressure of rising seas rotzoll and fletcher 2013 planting of certain tree species in such areas could help reduce high wte with the trees taking up rr and some groundwater benyon et al 2006 an array of other structural and physical methods such land use control engineering techniques and water recycling can also facilitate adaptation to climate variability bishnoi et al 2018 clifton et al 2010 such methods have for instance been used to enhance drought resilience in the california central valley and central arizona scanlon et al 2016 the preservation of ecosystems such as montane forests wetlands high recharge areas essential to replenishing groundwater resources should also be encouraged dragoni and sukhija 2008 managed aquifer recharge is also a promising technique under certain conditions e g when a source of surface water is available for recharge this technique is utilised worldwide dillon et al 2019 and developed in several nz regions e g hinds hekeao and makauri pilot projects in canterbury bower and sinclair 2016 and gisborne houlbrooke et al 2015 regions respectively currently underutilised in nz the most systematic reuse of treated stormwater and wastewater could also supplement the water supplies in water short areas foster et al 2019 5 4 2 institutional adaptation actions integrated management and water efficiency in nz water resources are managed by regional councils therefore reinforced policies on integrated management and conjunctive use of surface and ground water resources to develop resilience to climate variability unesco ihp 2015 could be introduced into regional plans adaptation to changing groundwater availability also necessitates the establishment of links between the water agriculture food energy and human and ecosystems health unesco ihp 2015 as decisions in one sector can impact another clifton et al 2010 dalin et al 2017 our results point to reduced groundwater availability with climate change for several catchments see the introduction of section 5 4 reduced water allocation in these catchments would be required to adapt to scarcer resources and maintain sustainable water management conversely more groundwater may be available for allocation where climate change projections suggest enhanced rr and wte over time resilience to climate change threats including water availability also implies reducing water demand to avoid aquifer over exploitation and resource depletion in nz water and allocation efficiency policies cover i improved economic outcomes ii larger water use in percentage of abstracted water and iii movement of water allocation between users however actual efficiency indicators to gauge the implementation and success of these efficiency policies are hardly used white 2018 adaptation to climate change threats could therefore focus on the systematic introduction of efficiency indicators and improving practices for activities with the lowest efficiency rates national and international adaptation strategies must also support transboundary management and sharing the water resources where necessary unesco ihp 2015 this would for example imply for some nz regions to share resources and expand management through regional boundaries for instance pressures from dry spells are already challenging the water supplies of the auckland council which now takes water from the adjacent waikato region niall 2021 5 4 3 social knowledge communication and community engagement the planning and implementation of adaptation actions are challenged by the uncertain environment in which decisions are made monitoring of these actions knowledge communication and community involvement are essential to success noble et al 2014 in this sense both outreach and community involvement actions have been initiated for dunedin city nz local government new zealand 2020 south dunedin is a low lying city area facing significant threats from climate change e g flooding extreme rainfall events shallow water table and rising sea levels south dunedin s vulnerability is compounded by an ageing infrastructure and low levels of wealth all adaption actions i e technical institutional and social usually benefit from unified implementation for instance shekhar et al 2020 outline that benefits from water efficiency measures i e irrigation use efficiency can be enhanced by combination with other management practices i e rainwater harvesting 5 5 recommendations for future modelling a wide range of future temperatures is projected by the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios e g table 1 appendix a4 incorporating uncertainty into tools to improve climate change resilience is recommended for future research we used the mean values of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios while a more robust way is to implement multiple ensembles that fit the uncertainty bandwidth of the scenarios e g rcp8 5 ensembles between the 5 and 95 confidence interval in parallel there is a need to better quantify rainfall and evapotranspiration uncertainties e g by calculating ensembles of model inputs and propagating these through the ngrm the groundwater modelling community has recently started to develop examples of more robust inclusion of uncertainty applicable for decision making in groundwater management e g guillaume et al 2016 knowling et al 2020 white et al 2020 most of these require the calculation of model ensembles which is applicable at the local scale but so far rather infeasible i e computationally too intensive for high resolution national scale models therefore we highlight the need for increased collaboration with this novel stream of decision making under uncertainty models including the potential of using simplified models e g doherty and moore 2020 for development at a larger scale 6 conclusion the characterisation of climate change induced impacts on groundwater is still in its infancy similarly the science of groundwater predictions under future climate change is relatively new and is constrained by high uncertainty including the earth s climate pathway to 2100 the choice of global climate models and downscaling these models to address local hydrogeological processes however response to global warming and climate change threats requires some urgency strategically groundwater has an essential role to play in the resilience development of communities therefore this paper describes a methodology to assess climate change induced effects on the groundwater resources of nz we used national and regional datasets and models i e the ngrm and nwt models with precipitation and temperature projections to 2100 to provide groundwater related projections under various emission pathways in the 21st century we calculated projected changes in p et rr and wte δ p et δrr and δwte for two nz regions hawke s bay and otago and for a selection of large river catchments and aquifer systems within these regions our results indicate contrasted δrr patterns with local and seasonal variations in these regions aquifers located in already dry areas are projected to receive less rr in the future while aquifers in areas of currently high rainfall should receive more rr anticipated land use changes in response to climate change also affect projections and outcomes δwte projections were assessed to mostly follow the same trends as δrr our results point to a potential increased failure of bores that draw water near the water table due to declining wte from less rr and increasing inundation issues in areas where rr increases and the wte is close to the ground surface in addition increased groundwater abstraction will compound groundwater availability issues in vulnerable aquifers and rising sea levels will increase inundation issues in coastal aquifers with shallow water tables we show that uncertainty of groundwater projections including ours is high because of uncertain future climate data and associated human response however we anticipate that our projections should be used sooner rather than later to start the planning the implementation and the monitoring of community based adaptation actions adjustments could then be made over time based on the effectiveness of actions varying climate conditions and changing human interactions further synergies between water related adaptation actions and energy and food sectors should also be sought to maximise success credit authorship contribution statement fmm led the conceptualization methodology interpretation project lead writing

8058,study region hawke s bay and otago regions north and south islands new zealand nz study focus evidence that climate change affects groundwater is emerging but a complete understanding of the processes and impacts on the resources remains limited in most countries including nz this paper presents a methodology to explore the potential effects of climate change on groundwater for an envelope of future climate scenarios i e low and high greenhouse gas emissions mid and end century the methodology uses national and sub national datasets and models and is applied to two case studies hawke s bay and otago its structure allows for future implementation in other nz regions new hydrological insights for the region results are provided as projected changes in precipitation minus evapotranspiration rainfall recharge to groundwater rr and water table elevation general water quantity reductions are projected for hawke s bay e g rr reduced by up to 1 5 mm d and more limited and variable changes for otago e g rr varying between 0 4 mm d we then present a discussion about furthering the science of climate change effects on groundwater characterisation of climate change uncertainty and unique effects and adaptation in the nz context we anticipate that our results despite limitations and uncertainty can enable adaptation actions without delay we recommend integrated and adaptive approaches including action effectiveness monitoring and community engagement to develop resilience to climate change threats graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater climate change rainfall recharge adaptation new zealand 1 introduction despite the importance of groundwater in the hydrological cycle and its association with climatic change dragoni and sukhija 2008 knowledge of the effects of climate change on the groundwater systems is limited in new zealand nz collins et al 2011 zemansky et al 2012 and insufficient worldwide green 2016 kundzewicz 2007 moseki 2018 groundwater and climate change studies began to be more widely published in peer reviewed journals after the release of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fourth assessment report in 2007 smerdon 2017 as groundwater provides substantial resources for human development ecological life and to sustain surface water low flows and water levels any impacts from climate change may be significant earman and dettinger 2011 taylor et al 2013 tillman et al 2020 unesco ihp 2015 therefore a sound understanding of how climate change will impact groundwater is crucial to predict how aquifers and their receiving environments will respond and how adverse effects might be limited cuthbert et al 2019 ghazi et al 2021 hughes et al 2021 new zealanders have embraced their connection to freshwater through te mana o te wai a recently adopted concept in legislation that recognises the vital importance of water accordingly freshwater s health and well being must be protected to protect the people and the wider environment collins 2020 ministry for the environment 2020b regrettably as for many other countries across the globe the quantity and the quality of the nz freshwater resources are rapidly degrading and facing multiple threats impacts are caused by land use unsustainable freshwater management practices and changing climate ministry for the environment and stats nz 2019 this paper acknowledges the importance of nz s key national groundwater resource rosen and white 2001 and its ability to provide resilience to climate change it describes projections of nz s future climate and approaches to resilience including its inextricable connection to the global climate change context a methodology is presented to assess climate change impact on future diffuse rainfall recharge to groundwater rr onwards such assessments are fundamental for the sustainable management of the groundwater resources atawneh et al 2021 although a 10 year review by these authors points to an uneven geographical distribution of publications on the topic for instance no peer reviewed studies investigating potential climate change induced effects on rr were identified in nz therefore our work aims to contribute to filling this knowledge gap using process based models which are the most used due to their accuracy and highly detailed presentation of the results atawneh et al 2021 our methodology is applied to two contrasted eastern nz regions hawke s bay and otago latitude c 39 s and 45 s respectively the diverse landscapes and climates of these regions ranging from dry to extremely wet and coastal low lying plains to high alpine areas offer potentially relevant insights for the many different areas in nz and are relevant to other countries our results are used for a broad discussion that considers adaptation and resilience in the context of i scientific evidence to facilitate decision making factoring uncertainty in the methodology and its calculations ii identifying the unique effects of climate change on groundwater when numerous drivers e g land use and seasonal variability are also impacting the resource and iii climate change adaptation and

is projected depending on global ghg emissions and associated climate feedbacks international response to climate change was recently discussed at the 26th united nation climate change conference of the parties cop26 during this conference nearly 200 countries agreed on the glasgow climate pact to limit global average temperature rises to 1 5 c and to finalise outstanding elements of the paris agreement un climate change conference 2021 global mean precipitation and evaporation are also expected to increase by 1 3 per c of warming intensifying heavy precipitation events and severe droughts douville et al 2021 due to the limitations of current modelling meixner et al 2016 smerdon 2017 ar6 does not provide any groundwater projections however important climate related changes in groundwater recharge are expected particularly where intensive human groundwater withdrawals occur douville et al 2021 2 2 nz climate change projections nz s climate change projections are based on ar5 climate model simulations and rcp scenarios ministry for the environment 2018 they have been produced by the national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa for the four rcps for the

based on their performance to represent historical climate and circulation patterns in the nz and pacific region six gcms bcc csm1 1 cesm1 cam5 gfdl cm3 giss e2 r hadgem2 es and noresm1 m were retained for dynamical downscaling by the niwa regional climate model rcm with a 5 km x 5 km resolution ministry for the environment 2018 mid range projected change for mean annual temperature is c 0 8 and 1 6 c for the mid century and end century periods respectively compared to 1986 2005 change in mean precipitation varies with location and season mean annual precipitation is mostly projected to increase in the west and the south of nz and decrease in the east and the north extreme events are expected to intensify with most of the extreme wet events occurring in the areas with projected mean precipitation increases and extreme dry events mostly occurring in areas already affected by droughts these projections are supported by regional climate modelling ministry for the environment 2018 2 3 impacts of climate change on groundwater it appears that climate change is impacting groundwater in two main ways directly by affecting replenishment through rr and indirectly by climate induced changes in abstraction associated with water demand taylor et al 2013 zhu et al 2020 observed effects on groundwater quantity are changes in i rr atawneh et al 2021 tillman et al 2017 2020 yifru et al 2021 ii groundwater storage groundwater levels mustafa et al 2019 wu et al 2020 zuo et al 2021 or thickness of the unsaturated zone anbar et al 2020 cao et al 2016 and iii groundwater discharge green 2016 zhu et al 2020 and interactions with surface water das et al 2021 groundwater quality can also be affected but to date has been less studied green 2016 rising sea levels induced by climate change can increase saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers impacting groundwater quality bishnoi et al 2018 ferguson and gleeson 2012 oude essink et al 2010 changes in hydrochemistry can also occur due to changes in rr atawneh et al 2021 and in the intensity of hydrochemical processes aladejana et al 2020 moore and joye 2021 the mechanisms involved in rr groundwater storage and flow are complex they involve interactions between the hydrological and energy cycles with feedback processes occurring between groundwater and the atmosphere in different parts of the world smerdon 2017 land cover types and particularly the presence of vegetation impervious surfaces and human induced activities e g groundwater abstraction managed aquifer recharge irrigation also impact the hydrological processes li et al 2021 untangling the effects of climate change from human disturbance and natural climate variability makes it challenging to resolve influences of driving forces and the mechanisms involved douville et al 2021 lehner et al 2020 sarojini et al 2016 there is additional complexity from long residence times in groundwater systems ranging from days to thousands of years and the associated time lags between a given climate event or human induced activity and the response of the groundwater systems green 2016 2 4 assessing and predicting the effects of climate change on groundwater monitoring and modelling are the two core approaches used to assess and predict groundwater changes and any effects of climate change earman and dettinger 2011 a common prerequisite to predict these effects is to sufficiently understand the geology and hydrogeology of the systems dragoni and sukhija 2008 this understanding covers for instance characterisation of the geological formations water bearing horizons aquifers geometry and hydraulic properties long term multi decades groundwater level records can be statistically analysed to infer natural variability anthropogenic influences and broader impacts of climate change park et al 2011 data on rainfall variability land use change and groundwater abstraction are required to fully elucidate effects directly related to climate change anbar et al 2020 advances in hydrograph analysis filtering and processing algorithms have allowed substantial progress in hydrological monitoring time series analysis haas and birk 2019 environmental isotope based approaches such as carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of groundwater have been used for several decades to infer paleoclimates dragoni and sukhija 2008 jiang et al 2019 yang and wang 2020 more recently remotely sensed data have started to supplement in situ monitoring networks in particular grace gravimetry data can inform groundwater storage changes within regional aquifer systems zuo et al 2021 predictions of climate change induced effects on groundwater are mostly derived from physically based modelling approaches with a wide range of model complexity e g processes and parameters included scales from local to global and level of integration with other models kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 moeck et al 2016 mustafa et al 2019 characterisation of uncertainty associated with these model predictions is essential to inform risk based decisions including adaptation holman et al 2012 lehner et al 2020 and is increasingly being incorporated into modelling atawneh et al 2021 the uncertainty of groundwater predictions under climate change is often considerable douville et al 2021 smerdon 2017 and conditioned mainly by choice of the gcms the downscaling methods applied and the hydro geo logical models crosbie et al 2013 earman and dettinger 2011 mustafa et al 2019 in the absence of system specific knowledge analogues between intensively studied groundwater systems and poorly characterised systems with similar hydrological conditions can be used to assess potential impacts from climate change green et al 2011 this approach may become increasingly relevant with the global effort to assess climate change effects on groundwater systems in areas with insufficient resources to inform adaptation unesco ihp 2015 2 5 mitigation adaptation and resilience to climate change threats 2 5 1 definitions and background in the ipcc ar5 climate change adaptation and mitigation are described as complementary strategies for reducing and managing the risks of climate change pachauri et al 2014 mitigation is defined as a human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases and adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects ipcc 2014 the paris agreement has strengthened mitigation and the glasgow climate pact financial support for adaptation un climate change conference 2021 united nations 2015 adaptation needs and capacity vary among regions countries and socio economic groups and will also vary over time countries and communities that are the most vulnerable are exposed to the highest climate change induced risks and have the slightest capacity to adapt due to limited resources klein et al 2014 mitigation aims to address global long term issues while adaptation focuses on solving local short term problems pasimeni et al 2019 interactions between these strategies and how to efficiently use them still need to be explored pittock et al 2016 sharifi 2021 both mitigation and adaptation are utilised to enhance resilience to climate change threats see below resilience being defined as the capacity of social economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function identity and structure while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation learning and transformation ipcc 2014 2 5 2 nz approach the nz government recently agreed on a national framework to drive climate change policy towards low ghg emissions and a climate resilient nation new zealand cabinet office 2020 the climate change response zero carbon amendment act new zealand parliament 2019 provides a series of domestic emission reduction targets including reduction of net ghg emissions except biogenic methane to zero by 2050 the first emissions reduction plan erp to be published by december 2021 will complement this act by describing methods to meet these targets ministry for the environment 2021a in parallel an independent climate change commission ccc established in december 2019 advises the government on climate change mitigation and adaptation measures the ccc will also monitor progress towards the target emissions budgets and on the implementation of a national adaptation plan nap scheduled for 2022 ministry for the environment 2021a the nap aims to characterise and respond to national climate change risks and guide regional and local adaptation actions it will be informed by the first national climate change risk assessment nccra august 2020 its translation for local governments and the actual regional assessments ministry for the environment 2019 2020a 2021b learnings from early climate change adaptation actions are starting to emerge for instance a case study addressing coastal erosion in hawke s bay highlighted the uncertainty about the roles of central and local authorities as one of the main challenges ministry for the environment and hawke s bay regional council partnership project 2020 2 5 3 adaptation for groundwater resilience groundwater will play a critical role in adapting to a changing climate as aquifers are more resilient to hydrological changes than surface water bodies and buffer seasonal changes in temperature and rainfall they can store large volumes of water during large rainfall events release water during drier periods limit evaporative loss and preserve water quality clifton et al 2010 the design of adaptation measures necessitates the understanding of processes and projected changes on the groundwater resources and highlights the importance of monitoring to be more effective time horizons to plan groundwater management and develop adaptation policies need to be significantly shorter than the actual climate change projections i e for the next 10 20 years rather than the next 50 100 years such shorter timeframes will enable resource managers to integrate new knowledge gained through monitoring and modelling to the adaptation policies see discussion these shorter timeframes will also ensure that considered land uses and soil conditions still represent the existing as they will presumably change as the communities adapt to the climate conditions smerdon 2017 3 material and methods the applied methodology utilises pre existing national and regional datasets and models to project climate change induced effects in regional groundwater systems the sub national scale was used as mesoscale approach to reduce uncertainty and provides valuable insights for resource management smerdon 2017 an initial literature review led to the identification of nz regions for which recent climate change projections were established two case study regions were then selected hawke s bay and otago for i their contrasted climate projections ii the regional importance of the groundwater resources iii a practical and established knowledge of the hydrogeological systems and iv their location in both the north and south islands fig 1 two climate change pathways utilised by the nccra framework were applied to explore the effects of climate change on groundwater fig 2 stabilisation rcp4 5 and high emission rcp8 5 projections were made for mid 2031 2050 and end 2081 2010 century 3 1 case study regions the hawke s bay region is located east of the north island fig 1 table 1 stretching from the kaimanawa ranges in the west to the pacific ocean in the east the regional climate is largely influenced by the orography and predominantly western airstreams crossing nz appendix a1 hawke s bay is sunny and less windy than other nz coastal areas and has highly variable and sporadic rainfall and very variable temperatures frequent dry spells deplete soil moisture and prevent plant growth chappell 2013 increases in annual mean temperatures and decreases in mean annual rainfall are projected in the future table 1 rainfall changes are projected to vary locally within the region with the largest changes occurring in particular seasons rather than annually the percentage of time spent in climatic drought is anticipated to increase fedaeff 2017 most of the region s groundwater resources are hosted in large aquifers systems located in the plains i e the heretaunga plains the ruataniwha plains and the northern coastal aquifer systems the hydrogeology of these systems is complex due to their depositional processes and superimposed tectonic activity multi layered aquifers systems alternate productive layers e g fluvial and alluvial gravels and sands with relatively impermeable sediments e g estuarine and marine mud and clay creating confined conditions luba 2001 regional groundwater abstraction is the second largest of the country based on the maximum annual consented volume of c 356 m m3 for the 2017 2018 reporting year stats nz 2020a some resources are fully or over allocated in particular in areas of intensive horticulture and urban centres the highest water demand comes from agriculture and declining groundwater levels are observed locally e g at bridge pa ngaruroro river catchment during dry summers but usually recover following significant recharge events or periods ministry for the environment and ministry for primary industries 2017a hawke s bay has the fourth largest area of irrigated land in nz this irrigated land area increased from 11 903 ha to 19 840 ha between 2002 and 2019 stats nz 2019 the otago region in the south island fig 1 table 1 stretches from the southern alps in the west to the pacific ocean in the east its regional climate appendix a1 is the most diverse of nz macara 2015 central otago is the driest area with 400 mm of rain annually and experiences temperature extremes of 25 6 to 38 7 c in 1903 and 2018 respectively increases in mean annual temperatures and in mean annual rainfall are anticipated in the future table 1 rainfall changes vary spatially and seasonally in the region with the most significant changes projected for particular seasons rather than annually more extreme rare rainfall events and larger floods are also predicted macara et al 2019 regional groundwater resources are mainly located in disconnected basins that often contain multiple aquifers only a few large aquifers are present in otago heller 2001 most of the aquifers are unconfined and hosted in quaternary outwash deposits in recent alluvial gravel or more rarely in volcanic formations more complex semi confined aquifers are found in the tertiary formations heller 2001 groundwater abstraction is the fourth largest of the country based on the maximum annual consented volume of c 183 m m3 for the 2017 2018 reporting year stats nz 2020a several catchments are over allocated for water quantity in otago with rivers that can run dry locally e g north and central otago in central otago this is often due to water rights attached to historic mining permits subsequently used for irrigation irrigation is the dominant water use excluding hydropower use ministry for the environment and ministry for primary industries 2017b otago has the second largest area of irrigated land in nz after the canterbury region its irrigated land area increased from 60 678 ha to 99 687 ha between 2002 and 2019 stats nz 2019 3 2 datasets and models national datasets and models provided underpinning data for this study to develop a replicable methodology to other nz regions table 2 fig 2 current climate conditions were informed by the virtual climate station network vcsn tait et al 2006 that provides daily precipitation and penman potential evapotranspiration pet onwards data from 1960 to the present day for nz in a regular grid 0 05 of latitude and longitude or c 5 km the nz river environment classification ministry for the environment 2010 was also utilised to investigate climate and groundwater changes in a selection of large regional river catchments similarly the hydrogeological system classification of moreau et al 2019 table 2 was used to delineate regional groundwater systems the national groundwater recharge model ngrm westerhoff et al 2018b is a nationwide soil water balance model calculating gross rr it was inspired by the watergap model döll and fiedler 2008 with the addition of improved nationwide datasets e g soil map vcsn rainfall and satellite derived actual evapotranspiration data et onwards in this study the ngrm was used to produce annual and seasonal projections of rr for our climate change scenarios the national water table model nwt westerhoff et al 2018a is a steady state groundwater flow model that calculates water table elevation wte onwards it was developed by improving a global scale model fan et al 2013 and feeding in national input data of nz terrain geology and rr and by slight adjustment of model parametrisation the nwt was developed as a solution to obtain a nationwide overview of groundwater that bridges the gap between the too expensive advanced local models and the too simple global scale models westerhoff et al 2018a the nwt was coupled to the ngrm to calculate projections of wte for our climate change scenarios these wte projections were annual and not seasonal as the nwt calculates the long term steady state wte the ngrm and nwt models were informed by regional data including niwa downscaled projections of mean annual and seasonal precipitation and temperature fedaeff 2017 macara et al 2019 pearce 2021 woolley 2021 table 2 both these models were designed to estimate historical values but are deemed suitable to include climate scenarios see discussion section 5 2 3 3 3 data processing 3 3 1 preparation of climate change datasets for each scenario niwa climate change projections are defined as seasonal change forecasts of precipitation change in and mean temperature change in c per season for each scenario the three months of each season were changed with the projected seasonal change value for the same spatial data grid as vcsn additional vcsn attributes were added for precipitation and temperature changes and named pscenario tmin scenario and tmax scenario respectively earlier research showed that pet both fao56 et0 and penman pet is dominantly sensitive to temperature followed by solar radiation relative humidity and cloudiness and therefore can be expressed as a function of temperature westerhoff 2015 with this function we estimated i a hypothetical current pet pethypothetical current using vcsn tmin and tmax values and ii a hypothetical pet for all climate change scenarios pethypothetical scenario using projected temperature change the difference in pet between current climate and climate scenarios δpet eq 1 was then defined as 1 δpet pethypothetical scenario pethypothetical current δpet was then extrapolated to the satellite pet eq 2 and et eq 3 as an input into the recharge model for each scenario 2 petscenario petsatellite δpet 3 etscenario etsatellite δpet the same value of δpet was used to adjust et estimates uncertainties associated with these assumptions are discussed in section 5 2 3 3 3 2 p et rr and wte projections mean annual p et calculations were undertaken for each scenario the ngrm was used to estimate mean seasonal and mean annual rr with input datasets for current climate and future climate scenarios fig 2 the nwt model was then run with the current and future rr climate change scenario from the ngrm and produced annual wte outputs rr and wte comparisons were made for the two case study regions statistics and maps of change in p et δ p et were produced for large regional surface water catchments and aquifers for each case study region changes in rr and wte δrr and δwte respectively were summarised in maps and statistics for the hydrogeological systems defined by moreau et al 2019 with the exception of basement rock hydrogeological systems fig 1 and table 2 and are referred to as aquifers select bore data was also utilised to investigate projected δwte where groundwater is abstracted for example in otago the bores with reliable water level data complete metadata and described as utilised were selected δwte was expressed in relation to the easting coordinate of the bores as both regions have ranges in the west and coastal plains in the east we defined our reference or current period to express changes i e δ p et δrr and δwte as 2000 2015 further explanations are provided in the discussion section 5 2 3 4 results 4 1 p et projections in general δ p et for both study regions is projected to decrease from the current climate conditions to future climate conditions rcp 4 5 and 8 5 mid and end century scenarios fig 3 annual median δ p et values are projected to decrease for both regions with the most significant reductions greater than 50 for the rcp 8 5 end century scenario annual 25 and 75 percentile data indicate more contrasted local changes with dominantly reduced δ p et values for hawke s bay and more variable results for otago ranging from δ p et reductions to increases seasonal projections also indicate some variability in seasonal trends and amplitudes of change in both regions median δ p et is projected to increase in summer and decrease in autumn however δ p et in winter is projected to reduce in hawke s bay but increase in otago the 25 75 percentile δ p et range varies between seasons as relative i e changes become more apparent in dryer seasons projections of δ p et also show important spatial variability for both regions suggesting for instance the influence of the orography figs 4 and 5 δ p et is projected to increase the most in the west of hawke s bay and otago where the highest mountain ranges are located 4 2 rr projections δrr is projected to decrease over the century in both regions under all climate projections with rcp8 5 scenario having the largest changes fig 6 δrr projections differ with regions hawke s bay is expected to have a general overall δrr reduction fig 7 current rr in appendix a2 and otago to have more spatial variability fig 8 current rr in appendix a2 in hawke s bay δrr is projected to decrease the most in the west for all seasons but winter in winter δrr reductions are more widespread in the region with values up to approximately 1 5 mm day except for a few limited extent areas where δrr increases are projected e g north west in otago δrr increases of up to 0 4 mm day are projected in the west south and east and δrr decreases reaching 0 4 mm day in central otago fig 8 4 3 wte projections annual δwte projections indicate clear changes associated with our future climate scenarios fig 9 current wte in appendix a3 in hawke s bay δwte is projected to be significantly negative with some areas having values reaching 10 m by the end century under rcp8 5 δwte in large coastal and river plains where most aquifers are situated is generally less significant than δwte for aquifers located in narrow and higher elevation inland valleys otago is projected to have more minor amplitude variations of δwte than hawke s bay with positive values in the west south and east and negative values in central otago however for certain otago aquifers locally projections indicate water table declines up to several metres e g for aquifers located in the driest areas of the upper clutha and taieri river catchments see section 4 5 4 4 combined results for regional surface water catchments and aquifers in general individual surface water catchments follow the regional trends of δ p et δrr and δwte however some local variability is also projected table 3 figs 10 and 11 4 4 1 change in p et in both regions δ p et reductions are usually more pronounced for aquifers than surface water catchments in hawke s bay the median changes in δ p et point to general water availability reductions with climate change for the case study river catchments and aquifers the largest reductions are projected in the ngaruroro and tukituki river catchments in otago δ p et reductions are particularly marked for the taieri river catchment which has its headwaters located in the driest area of nz interestingly the kakanui river catchment otago displays a different trend despite δ p et decreases in the surface water catchment in which headwaters are also located in an arid area δ p et increases are projected for the aquifers situated near the coast 4 4 2 change in rr δrr projections generally follow the δ p et projection trends for the aquifers with smaller δrr percentages than δ p et percentages exceptionally opposite trends are projected for the pomahaka river catchment otago with δ p et reductions and δrr increases for the aquifers trends of δ p et and δrr do not necessarily have to go in the same direction because i subsurface drainage properties also control rr and ii the ngrm resolution is much finer than the area of the whole river catchments and aquifers investigated for which the median of the data was used in addition small differences as projected for the pomahaka river catchment can be amplified when expressed as percentages of change the most considerable δrr reductions are projected for aquifers located in the tukituki river catchment hawke s bay and the manuherekia and ida catchments otago significant increases are also anticipated for the kakanui river catchment otago 4 4 3 change in wte δwte is projected to change the most for end century scenarios with a majority of decreases table 3 and the largest decreases projected for aquifers located in the ngaruroro and mohaka river catchments hawke s bay rare δwte increases are however projected in otago with the largest rises projected for the aquifers located in the kakanui river catchment 4 5 wte change and bores in the previous section table 3 figs 10 and 11 we presented δwte projections expressed as median δwte values for the different aquifers located in a surface water catchment alternatively we also calculated δwte projections at the location of existing and used bores these latter results give maximum changes up to c 9 m in hawke s bay and to 5 m in otago fig 12 in the ngaruroro river catchment hawke s bay δwte projections at bore locations indicate more pronounced reductions for the inland or upper catchment bores in the west compared to the coastal or lower catchment bores in the east in otago δwte values suggest the largest increases for the bores located in the west along the southern alps and east along the coast and general reductions for central otago bores the pomahaka river catchment bores have a central easting but are located south otago where δwte projections show increases 5 discussion the climate change pathway that the world will take to 2100 is unclear for some rcp 2 6 low co2 future is possible in 2021 there is a 50 chance that humankind can attain this future with a rapid change in global co2 generation i e 50 per decade cumulative between 2020 and 2050 figueres and rivett carnac 2021 however global fossil fuel co2 generation in the 2000 2020 period possibly points to a high co2 future that is more like rcp 8 5 and to the difficulty of attaining the paris agreement i e keeping global average temperature well within 2 c above pre industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1 5 c united nations 2015 for example the 2000 2020 period saw world cumulative increase in the population of approximately 13 per decade united nations 2019 and co2 generation from fossil fuels of approximately 16 per decade worldometer 2021 within this period growth in energy use from fossil fuel sources is still outpacing the rise of low carbon sources and activities jackson et al 2018 building resilience would appear as the appropriate climate change strategy given uncertainties in future human response to climate change and in scientific predictions of the effects i e amplitude timing and location of climate change on groundwater resources this discussion aims to assist groundwater managers and users by considering scientific evidence including limitations and uncertainty as relevant to the decision making process identifying the unique effects of climate change on groundwater and adaptation to climate change 5 1 groundwater and climate change furthering the science our projections of change in rr and wte suggest different trends across the two case study regions and between otago catchments these differences are mainly driven by the climate projections used by our groundwater models and fedaeff 2017 and macara et al 2019 some aquifers are projected to receive less rr and show decreasing wte which is a general trend projected in hawke s bay and some central otago river catchments conversely other aquifers are projected to have increased rr and wte in specific catchments of otago e g kakanui and kawarau river catchments the general trends in our results i e already very dry areas getting drier e g central otago and already wet areas getting wetter e g otago s kawarau river catchment are inferred to be transposable to the rest of nz the science of groundwater and climate change will be furthered by i addressing the incomplete knowledge and data associated with groundwater systems and ii better climate change predictions therefore there is now some urgency to these science needs due to nz wide implications of this study and the importance of the period 2020 2050 in the earth s climate change future see below 5 1 1 improved local knowledge and data at the catchment scale knowledge limitations include uncertainties with the geometry and properties of the flow system and climate influenced water budget elements such as groundwater use groundwater use is often available as maximum allocated amounts in nz and therefore not representative of actual withdrawn volumes systematic metering of groundwater use only recently a mandatory requirement ministry for the environment 2020c will greatly benefit model data inputs in both our case study regions some aquifers provide large amounts of groundwater for irrigation e g heretaunga aquifer in the ngaruroro river catchment hawke s bay improved knowledge of actual groundwater use will therefore help maintain sustainable allocation limits especially for aquifers where reduced rr and wte are projected e g which is the case of aquifers located in the ngaruroro river catchment land use projections and the timing of change e g land use land cover and growing season duration are also uncertain and will influence rr and water use 5 1 2 improved groundwater models the ngrm and nwt models produced rr and wte projections associated with climate change for our case study regions this approach shows the benefits of these first assessments to groundwater resource management however these models do not account for all processes affecting the groundwater resources and point to the need to integrate groundwater abstraction data surface water groundwater interaction and potential effects of rising seas for coastal aquifers all these additional processes are important in our case study regions and nationwide in addition groundwater modelling typically does not account for the projected increases in rainfall duration and intensity and storm frequency even with a daily time step kendon et al 2014 increases in rainfall intensity will also likely impact soil erosion soil properties and rr processes burt et al 2015 leading to increased run off and reduced water available for rr in response groundwater modelling will need to assume variability in the physical properties of a landscape including rainfall intensity soil properties and land use many of the processes within groundwater systems are largely driven by rr so an improved understanding of these processes and how they will be modified is critical to understanding the effects of climate change on groundwater however climate models produce varying predictions of rr hughes et al 2021 typically rr is calculated by numerical models as in this paper because rr can be difficult to measure directly anderson et al 2015 this generally means that modelled rr is not verified by observations atawneh et al 2021 however rr observations have played a key role in rr model development e g hong et al 2005 mourot et al 2019 white et al 2003 likely observations will play an essential role in the future e g assessment of unsaturated zone processes that are influenced by climate change 5 2 uncertainty and climate change uncertainties associated with climate change are relevant to potential adaptation strategies as decision makers consider future risks associated with the groundwater resource following atawneh et al 2021 the uncertainty of our methodology includes i the earth s climate change pathway in the 21st century ii climate models i e global and regional downscaled models including climate observations used for climate predictions and iii rr models 5 2 1 pathways the actual future pathway of the earth s climate depends on societal decisions e g population economic strategic and political upward pressure on future co2 generation is provided by the increase in the world population of approximately 40 to 2100 united nations 2019 most of this increase will be in emerging countries and will increase specific co2 emissions as it has occurred in china and india since 2000 jackson et al 2018 however political pressure on economies to decarbonise may counter the above pressures certainly the world is seeking alternatives to fossil fuels and we have to be optimistic that affordable alternatives to fossil fuels will be developed increasingly the role of regulation will come to the fore the difficult challenge to keep the world on the 2 c pathway foreshadows more aggressive future energy and economic policies to meet any co2 emission targets sharma et al 2019 the world is now within the period 2020 2050 a decisive interval for 2100 climate outcomes according to figueres and rivett carnac 2021 5 2 2 global models regional models and uncertainty the ability of models to represent observed data is a strong indicator of the quality of model predictions therefore the quality of observed data is a key concern to climate modelling gcms are generally improving over time with increased computer power more observational data and advances in our understanding of climate processes eyring and gillett 2021 however gcms are too coarse to represent catchment scale processes adequately and thus dynamical or statistical downscaling is needed see review this downscaling process may introduce significant local and regional scale uncertainty the uncertainty of model projections is perhaps of primary concern to science users macara et al 2019 project a mean global increase in the otago temperatures for the end of the century with a near doubling of temperatures in rcp8 5 relative to rcp4 5 appendix a4 this comparison highlights the importance of future climate pathways 5 2 3 rr models and uncertainty uncertainty in rr calculated with the ngrm averaged 17 nz mean annual in the period 2000 2015 westerhoff et al 2018b this uncertainty was computed by propagating uncertainty of model inputs i e precipitation evapotranspiration soil properties terrain and geology into the rr calculation the uncertainty in evapotranspiration calculation as used in the ngrm can range from 10 to 40 and is most sensitive to temperature westerhoff 2015 sensitivity testing of the nwt model westerhoff 2018a supplement showed that nominal variations in groundwater elevation were 10 m in the foothills of coastal hawke s bay aquifers and 3 m in coastal otago aquifers in response to a variation 20 of mean recharge climate scenario calculations in this study include additional uncertainties i e beyond those of westerhoff et al 2018b and westerhoff 2015 the ngrm and niwa model projections use different baseline periods i e 2000 2015 as satellite evapotranspiration data is unavailable before 2000 and 1986 2006 respectively however mean values of precipitation and temperature for the two different periods are comparable i e the differences in precipitation were 0 and 3 for hawke s bay and otago respectively and we assume these are within the uncertainty range of evapotranspiration data additional uncertainty is introduced by the use of the temperature pet relation to estimating changes in pet and et and the extrapolation that et changes with the same rate as pet this uncertainty is likely to be small as we relied on the existing satellite data et estimates and their extrapolated rates of change to estimate change given that comprehensive pet calculations have uncertainties of 10 40 and et uncertainties are likely higher we found the unknown but likely smaller uncertainty acceptable the uncertainty of rr will be greater in future climate scenarios because the ngrm calculations include niwa climate projections for example ngrm rr uncertainty will be larger than westerhoff et al 2018b because of uncertainties in future evapotranspiration which includes future temperature projections seasonal extremes are important in this paper s analysis of future climate impacts the seasonal information in the climate projections of our case studies did not contain events that were more extreme than those modelled by westerhoff et al 2018b and westerhoff 2015 therefore we assume that uncertainties in seasonal extreme calculations of this paper are likely to be similar to these published results 5 3 untangling the effects of climate change land use and groundwater management this study has researched climate induced impacts on rr and wte because they are often under represented and less quantified in nz studies however other human induced drivers also impact groundwater such as land use change water demand and protection restoration of receiving environments white and close 2016 5 3 1 effects of different scale policies human induced drivers influence long term climate change but more urgently they cause more immediate effects than climate variability for example dry events affect groundwater depletion mainly due to amplified groundwater withdrawals for agriculture falkenmark and lannerstad 2005 taylor et al 2013 wada et al 2010 the effect of groundwater abstraction on saline intrusion is also magnitudes larger than the effect of sea level rise ferguson and gleeson 2012 yu and michael 2019 catchment scale policies related to water or land use could counteract national scale long term policies developed for adaptation for instance catchment scale water management regulations often address the more immediate issues allowing more water abstraction in drier summers or pumping and draining water out in wetter times in low lying coastal areas for immediate flood control these activities combined with large scale land use changes such as dam construction deforestation or wetland drainage for agriculture haddeland et al 2014 robertson et al 2018 stats nz 2018 could amplify the climate induced depletion effects land impacted by human activity responds differently to climate variability e g with changes in streamflow evapotranspiration or discharge to sea compared to undisturbed ecosystems hosseini moghari et al 2020 taylor et al 2013 5 3 2 separation of climate driven impacts and human induced impacts the layman might easily confuse the effects of climate change on groundwater systems with the effects of human induced change this confusion arises because the links between climate and groundwater resources are clouded by modern day land use change for example decreases in rainfall due to climate change and the conversion of native grasslands to water intensive crops may both contribute to rr reductions in addition the effect of climate mitigation measures on the water cycle e g reduced stream flows in catchments afforested for carbon sequestration adds further complexity douville et al 2021 point to the importance and complexity of distinguishing climate variability from anthropogenic impacts in the water cycle however studies typically address only parts of this complexity e g confirming correlation to human actions and calculating water demand components at the global scale albarakat et al 2018 taylor et al 2013 wada et al 2012 5 3 3 possible paths forward from this study to untangle complexities our results e g δ p et and δrr and δwte projections for the pomahaka river catchment section 4 4 indicate that our analyses can be performed at even finer scale than the river catchments and aquifer areas utilised in our case studies if deemed useful for water management this study starts bottom up in solving these abovementioned complexities by a better spatial quantification of climate induced components on groundwater by providing data in multiple forms and views as initial tools for policymakers and water managers we hope this will form input in developing more complex subsequent tools including better linkages to human induced effects inspiration for these tools can be drawn from recent model studies at local and global scales haddeland et al 2014 wu et al 2020 yifru et al 2021 however the collaboration between key stakeholders at both catchment and national scales to provide policymakers tools is a more fundamental and possible more significant challenge 5 4 climate change adaptation climate change threats i e more frequent droughts and floods melting of glaciers and rising sea levels are already present in nz regions ministry for the environment and stats nz 2020 in addition this study points to scarcer groundwater resources e g in the tukituki and ngaruroro river catchments in hawke s bay in the manuherekia and ida catchments in otago reduced groundwater availability would likely impact the local communities and the environment e g by providing less water for irrigation and less baseflow to support stream ecological health in contrast increased rr and wte e g kakanui river catchment in otago could lead to shallower water tables and favour inundations impacting communities and infrastructure adaptation of the current groundwater management practices is therefore necessary and climate change resilience to such threats requires resource managers and communities to adapt and strategically re think current practices foster et al 2019 three main types of adaptation actions are discussed hereafter for implementation in nz regions i structural and physical ii institutional and iii social adaptation actions noble et al 2014 5 4 1 structural and physical select land uses and engineering techniques our results indicate aquifer areas where wte is projected to decrease further work would confirm the risk of running dry for shallow bores located in these areas jasechko and perrone 2021 in the affected areas the drilling of deeper bores where possible would then help adapt to lower wte conversely higher wte is projected in some locations with a potential increased inundation hazard especially for coastal aquifers under the pressure of rising seas rotzoll and fletcher 2013 planting of certain tree species in such areas could help reduce high wte with the trees taking up rr and some groundwater benyon et al 2006 an array of other structural and physical methods such land use control engineering techniques and water recycling can also facilitate adaptation to climate variability bishnoi et al 2018 clifton et al 2010 such methods have for instance been used to enhance drought resilience in the california central valley and central arizona scanlon et al 2016 the preservation of ecosystems such as montane forests wetlands high recharge areas essential to replenishing groundwater resources should also be encouraged dragoni and sukhija 2008 managed aquifer recharge is also a promising technique under certain conditions e g when a source of surface water is available for recharge this technique is utilised worldwide dillon et al 2019 and developed in several nz regions e g hinds hekeao and makauri pilot projects in canterbury bower and sinclair 2016 and gisborne houlbrooke et al 2015 regions respectively currently underutilised in nz the most systematic reuse of treated stormwater and wastewater could also supplement the water supplies in water short areas foster et al 2019 5 4 2 institutional adaptation actions integrated management and water efficiency in nz water resources are managed by regional councils therefore reinforced policies on integrated management and conjunctive use of surface and ground water resources to develop resilience to climate variability unesco ihp 2015 could be introduced into regional plans adaptation to changing groundwater availability also necessitates the establishment of links between the water agriculture food energy and human and ecosystems health unesco ihp 2015 as decisions in one sector can impact another clifton et al 2010 dalin et al 2017 our results point to reduced groundwater availability with climate change for several catchments see the introduction of section 5 4 reduced water allocation in these catchments would be required to adapt to scarcer resources and maintain sustainable water management conversely more groundwater may be available for allocation where climate change projections suggest enhanced rr and wte over time resilience to climate change threats including water availability also implies reducing water demand to avoid aquifer over exploitation and resource depletion in nz water and allocation efficiency policies cover i improved economic outcomes ii larger water use in percentage of abstracted water and iii movement of water allocation between users however actual efficiency indicators to gauge the implementation and success of these efficiency policies are hardly used white 2018 adaptation to climate change threats could therefore focus on the systematic introduction of efficiency indicators and improving practices for activities with the lowest efficiency rates national and international adaptation strategies must also support transboundary management and sharing the water resources where necessary unesco ihp 2015 this would for example imply for some nz regions to share resources and expand management through regional boundaries for instance pressures from dry spells are already challenging the water supplies of the auckland council which now takes water from the adjacent waikato region niall 2021 5 4 3 social knowledge communication and community engagement the planning and implementation of adaptation actions are challenged by the uncertain environment in which decisions are made monitoring of these actions knowledge communication and community involvement are essential to success noble et al 2014 in this sense both outreach and community involvement actions have been initiated for dunedin city nz local government new zealand 2020 south dunedin is a low lying city area facing significant threats from climate change e g flooding extreme rainfall events shallow water table and rising sea levels south dunedin s vulnerability is compounded by an ageing infrastructure and low levels of wealth all adaption actions i e technical institutional and social usually benefit from unified implementation for instance shekhar et al 2020 outline that benefits from water efficiency measures i e irrigation use efficiency can be enhanced by combination with other management practices i e rainwater harvesting 5 5 recommendations for future modelling a wide range of future temperatures is projected by the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios e g table 1 appendix a4 incorporating uncertainty into tools to improve climate change resilience is recommended for future research we used the mean values of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios while a more robust way is to implement multiple ensembles that fit the uncertainty bandwidth of the scenarios e g rcp8 5 ensembles between the 5 and 95 confidence interval in parallel there is a need to better quantify rainfall and evapotranspiration uncertainties e g by calculating ensembles of model inputs and propagating these through the ngrm the groundwater modelling community has recently started to develop examples of more robust inclusion of uncertainty applicable for decision making in groundwater management e g guillaume et al 2016 knowling et al 2020 white et al 2020 most of these require the calculation of model ensembles which is applicable at the local scale but so far rather infeasible i e computationally too intensive for high resolution national scale models therefore we highlight the need for increased collaboration with this novel stream of decision making under uncertainty models including the potential of using simplified models e g doherty and moore 2020 for development at a larger scale 6 conclusion the characterisation of climate change induced impacts on groundwater is still in its infancy similarly the science of groundwater predictions under future climate change is relatively new and is constrained by high uncertainty including the earth s climate pathway to 2100 the choice of global climate models and downscaling these models to address local hydrogeological processes however response to global warming and climate change threats requires some urgency strategically groundwater has an essential role to play in the resilience development of communities therefore this paper describes a methodology to assess climate change induced effects on the groundwater resources of nz we used national and regional datasets and models i e the ngrm and nwt models with precipitation and temperature projections to 2100 to provide groundwater related projections under various emission pathways in the 21st century we calculated projected changes in p et rr and wte δ p et δrr and δwte for two nz regions hawke s bay and otago and for a selection of large river catchments and aquifer systems within these regions our results indicate contrasted δrr patterns with local and seasonal variations in these regions aquifers located in already dry areas are projected to receive less rr in the future while aquifers in areas of currently high rainfall should receive more rr anticipated land use changes in response to climate change also affect projections and outcomes δwte projections were assessed to mostly follow the same trends as δrr our results point to a potential increased failure of bores that draw water near the water table due to declining wte from less rr and increasing inundation issues in areas where rr increases and the wte is close to the ground surface in addition increased groundwater abstraction will compound groundwater availability issues in vulnerable aquifers and rising sea levels will increase inundation issues in coastal aquifers with shallow water tables we show that uncertainty of groundwater projections including ours is high because of uncertain future climate data and associated human response however we anticipate that our projections should be used sooner rather than later to start the planning the implementation and the monitoring of community based adaptation actions adjustments could then be made over time based on the effectiveness of actions varying climate conditions and changing human interactions further synergies between water related adaptation actions and energy and food sectors should also be sought to maximise success credit authorship contribution statement fmm led the conceptualization methodology interpretation project lead writing

reorganization of groundwater management under california s 2014 sustainable groundwater management act sgma study focus understanding land use and land cover change supports long term sustainable water management anthropogenic water demand has depleted groundwater aquifers worldwide while future water shortages will likely affect land use change creating system feedbacks our novel participatory approach fused changes in land use and associated water use from county scale data to local water agencies estimates of total sustainable supply scaling up local hydro geologic knowledge from heterogeneous aquifers and diverse management approaches to a regional level we assessed five stakeholder driven scenarios with the same historic rates of urban and agricultural land use change but different water and land use management analyzing how management strategies altered both the spatial pattern of development and subsequent water sustainability from 2001 to 2061 new hydrological insights for the region transformative strategies using demand side interventions that coupled water availability to land use more effectively achieved long term sustainability than adaptive strategies using supply side interventions to increase water supplies limiting water withdrawals within sgma regulated basins resulted in leakage of development into unregulated basins increasing

essential life sustaining resource for billions of people worldwide providing a buffer against precipitation variability and water shortages during drought fao 2016 however many groundwater basins worldwide are already experiencing ongoing and long term declines in groundwater levels famiglietti 2014 stonestrom et al 2009 wada et al 2012 chronic groundwater overdraft where water extractions exceed recharge can cause loss of water quality saltwater intrusion land subsidence and the drying of groundwater dependent ecosystems and elimination of fish and wildlife populations that depend on them kløve et al 2011 moreover there can be disproportionate impacts on socio economically disadvantaged communities which rely on the resource dobbin 2018 the sustainable management of groundwater is inextricably linked to land use land cover hereafter land use for brevity change and the long term resilience of local communities agricultural expansion and urbanization will further deplete groundwater supplies wilson et al 2016 and future water shortages will likely in turn affect land use change creating feedbacks within the system biggs et al 2010 venot et al 2010 despite the importance of feedbacks most integrated models of land use and hydrology have only used one way couplings chen et al 2016 yalew et al 2018 hydrological models frequently estimate changes in runoff recharge transpiration and other watershed processes under different external land use scenarios bhaduri et al 2000 fohrer et al 2001 karvonen et al 1999 tong et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 land use change models rarely simulate hydrology de rosa et al 2016 and when they have included hydrological components it has often been a one way assessment of impacts c f howells et al 2013 liu et al 2017 modeling feedbacks is particularly important for predicting how systems will respond to policy change chen et al 2016 including adequate institutional rules and management strategies to address groundwater depletion and achieve water sustainability foster and garduño 2013 socio hydrology has emerged as a relatively new discipline that uses models to understand the dynamic feedbacks between water systems and human systems di baldassarre et al 2015 pan et al 2018 california is an ideal location for studying the linkages between land use groundwater and potentially transformative governance following the state s passage in 2014 of the sustainable groundwater management act sgma this law mandates the formation of new groundwater sustainability agencies gsas for the state s 127

lands langridge 2018 ongoing development which we define as the conversion of rangelands to cropland of rangelands and cropland to domestic or industrial uses and of annual crops to higher value perennial vineyards and orchards presents challenges in planning for future water supplies wilson et al 2020 these problems may be exacerbated under climate change with higher temperatures and more

finished model and spatial data are available as data releases van schmidt et al 2021 lucas w was empirically fit from historic land use rates and local hydrology studies we worked with local water agencies land use planners and other stakeholders to create a scenario based approach identifying vulnerabilities and adaptive capacity under multiple plausible futures appendix s1 1 1 our focus in this paper is not on exploring alternative economic development pathways scenarios held the underlying historical rates of land use change constant or predicting a precise future state a task that is challenging and impossible to validate for land use change models messina et al 2008 rather we sought to assess the central coast s adaptive capacity by modeling how management strategies proposed under sgma could work with local zoning strategies to alter the spatial pattern of land use change and associated stress on water systems at a regional scale our goal was exploring possible future solution spaces where novel processes could change historic trajectories messina et al 2008 following predictions of resilience theory walker et al 2006 we hypothesized that management strategies using demand side interventions would be more capable of mitigating long term overdraft than supply side interventions because the former are transformative they add new couplings between water usage and water sustainability while the latter are only adaptive they alter a water supply variable to adjust to a specific water need walker et al 2006 2 theory we use a resilience theory framework to tackle two central questions for socio ecological systems research 1 how will land use patterns change with ongoing changes in water availability and 2 what is the role of reciprocal relationships i e couplings and feedbacks in transforming systems from fragile configurations into resilient ones kramer et al 2017 resilience theory is a broad interdisciplinary approach combining examinations of complex system behavior effective governance cooperation and social learning bakker and morinville 2013 folke 2006 walker et al 2006 resilience scholars use the adaptive cycle fig 1 top as a conceptual model to understand the dynamics of socio ecological systems folke 2006 systems adapt by alternating between long periods of resilient growth exploitation and accumulation of resource dependent structures that cause fragility conservation and shorter periods of disturbance induced change release and restructuring to a new normal reorganization after which the cycle repeats gunderson and holling 2002 in california groundwater management can be aligned with the adaptive cycle fig 1 bottom groundwater extraction historically had little coordinated institutional oversight an exploitation phase where abundant resources increased water dependent developed leahy 2016 this led to a conservation phase where the development s accumulated water demands created increasing rigidity political resistance to statewide regulations and fragility groundwater declines in many basins leahy 2016 a severe 2012 2016 drought led to a release phase of disturbance induced change wherein the unsustainable demands contributed to unprecedented well failures water shortages and emergency water restrictions leahy 2016 these pressures contributed to the passage in 2014 of sgma wat 10720 10737 8 california water code 2015 marking the reorganization phase with the potential for transformative new sustainable groundwater management leahy 2016 resilience theory states that management strategies that only alter the system s existing state variables e g supply side strategies that only change the amount of water in the system are adaptive in nature these are hypothesized to be less capable of achieving sustainability than strategies that transform system function by adding new linkages walker et al 2006 thus resilience theory predicts that demand side sgma strategies which newly link water sustainability to land use should be more effective at achieving long term sustainability 3 material and methods 3 1 study area california s central coast is a 28 534 km2 region covering five counties santa cruz san benito monterey san luis obispo and santa barbara the mediterranean climate has hot dry summers and cool wet winters it is a global hotspot of biodiversity with high potential vulnerability to climate change langridge 2018 rundel et al 2016 at the region s center is the salinas valley an agricultural area of national importance and the city of salinas the central coast s largest municipality population of 158 000 monterey county farm bureau 2018 it is among the region s 48 cities or census areas classified by the state as disadvantaged communities california epa 2018 and the 68 census areas at risk for water inaffordability mack and wrase 2017 many of which are economically disadvantaged agricultural communities water use is dominated by agriculture and water demand varies significantly across crop types allan et al 1998 in some areas such as the paso robles region a rapid transition from rangeland to perennial agriculture has changed underlying groundwater basins from stable to critically overdrafted in a decade giffin et al 2011 groundwater depletion has caused the drying of wells and seawater intrusion into aquifers monterey county water resources agency 2017 land use change models project significant expansions of agricultural and urban areas by the end of the century that will likely worsen groundwater overdraft wilson et al 2016 2017 2020 these trends threaten the region s extensive undeveloped distinctive coastal grassland and shrubland ecosystems including areas surrounding national and state parks and major tourist destinations such as the big sur coast wilson et al 2020 development and falling groundwater tables jointly imperil endangered species such as california red legged frogs rana draytonii and the southwestern willow flycatcher empidonax traillii extimus u s fish and wildlife service 2002a 2002b 3 2 the lucas w model 3 2 1 modeling framework our land use change model lucas w van schmidt et al 2021 is a modified version of the lucas model land use and carbon scenario simulator sleeter et al 2015 wilson et al 2016 2017 2020 a spatially explicit empirical state and transition simulation model developed in the st sim package of program syncrosim v2 2 13 apexrms 2019 daniel et al 2016 the model divides the landscape into spatially discrete simulation cells i e a raster each with assigned land use state classes that can change annually each anthropogenic land use class is attributed with an historic area based water use estimate enabling land use projections to track related water demand over the scenario simulations wilson et al 2016 we previously developed a lucas model specifically for the central coast at 270 m resolution 391 421 cells wilson et al 2020 which we updated to create lucas w each cell is also attributed to a 1 county 2 gsa and adjudicated basin management area and 3 groundwater basin based on data from cdwr 2015b 3 2 2 land use change parameterization the following land use classes formed the initial landscape conditions in the lucas w model rangeland forest wetland water barren transportation developed i e residential or industrial and perennial cropland and annual cropland and appendix a 1 2 1 these land use classes could change with the following land use transitions urbanization rangeland or annual perennial cropland converting into developed agricultural expansion rangeland to annual perennial cropland agricultural contraction annual perennial cropland to rangeland and agricultural intensification annual cropland to perennial cropland we refer to all anthropogenic land use changes as development for brevity but italicize developed when referring to the specific modeled land use class the rates of transitions are set as county specific annual targets randomly sampled from distributions of historical rates observed from 1992 to 2016 appendix a 1 2 2 in the five counties historic land use conversion data tables obtained from california department of conservation 2017 transitions are stochastically placed based on adjacency rules and spatial multipliers that prevent or prioritize land use transitions within certain areas daniel et al 2016 3 2 3 water demand parameterization to parameterize lucas w s water demand developed annual cropland and perennial cropland cells were attributed with county specific water demand values in acre feet per year afy 1 acre foot 1233 5 m3 per km2 for each cell fig a 1 appendix a 1 2 3 wilson et al 2016 2017 2020 developed water use represented both domestic and industrial demand and was estimated from maupin et al 2014 cropland water use was based on the cdwr agricultural land and water use 1998 2010 dataset cdwr 2014 3 2 4 model validation we followed standard approaches to validation in system dynamics research by performing validation tests over the historic period prior to the management strategy analysis stage barlas 1996 we first performed structure validation by rigorously proofing the model and resulting datasets with internal testing and an external data and code review our process was iterative and we made revisions to the model parameterization and structure described in appendix a 1 1 a 1 2 3 until the model achieved reasonable validation we next performed empirical structure tests barlas 1996 by simulating the historic period using each year s actual annual rate of land use change from the 1992 2016 data california dept of conservation 2017 inspection of outputs showed that the model simulated the input historic rates of land use change nearly 1 1 r2 0 99 for expected vs observed rates 2001 2016 mean over 10 iterations van schmidt et al 2021 lucas w accurately predicted total land use and associated water demand when comparing our modeled estimates of county wide water demand to independent external datasets we compared lucas w s projected annual cropland perennial cropland water demand estimates to independent usgs 2005 and 2010 datasets maupin et al 2014 the mean cropland error across counties and time periods was 7800 afy rmse 30 847 afy equivalent to 4 1 of the water use of a county on average fig a 2a we compared lucas w s developed water demand estimates to an independent cdwr dataset from 2005 to 2010 cdwr 2014 the mean developed error was 4637 afy rmse 7403 afy equivalent to 8 9 of the water use of a county on average fig a 2b for all measures there was no clear trend of over or underestimation across counties fig a 2 the model s estimates therefore reasonably represented independent empirical estimates validating the model quantitative validation of the accuracy of future projections and management strategy impacts was not possible because these represented hypothetical futures a common issue in such models messina et al 2008 in lieu of external quantitative validation a process based approach of engaging with stakeholders in participatory workshops and interviews has been recommended as an alternative way to ensure models reasonably represent real world dynamics and emerging policies messina et al 2008 moss 2008 we did this via interviews and workshops with agency staff during model design parameterization and presentation of results 3 3 participatory scenario development we used a stakeholder driven scenario development approach to create an evidence based body of research about the impacts of specific land use and water management adaptation strategies we held a series of six meetings with local institutions and non profits hereafter stakeholders to oversee model development identify local priorities and potential adaptations for land and water management and aid in interpretation of results appendix a 1 1 meetings were informal discussions with no quantitative data gathered partners included the california climate change collaborative a network of diverse organizations representatives from the city of salinas and other city and county land use agencies and the elkhorn slough foundation an environmental non profit stakeholders identified the following water sustainability goals 1 sufficient water especially during drought 2 reduce or halt groundwater level declines and 3 reduce water pollution key sustainable land use goals were 1 address the loss of prime farmland 2 maintain healthy ecosystems and 3 develop sufficient low and medium income housing quantitative modeling of strategies to address low and medium income housing needs were determined to be beyond the scope of this study we identified two water and two land management strategies to quantitatively assess for their ability to achieve regional sustainability and to identify any tradeoffs between these different goals water management strategies were 1 demand side interventions to reduce water dependent development in overdrafted areas and 2 supply side interventions to increase water supplies land use management strategies were 3 preserving the best agricultural lands and recharge areas and 4 conservation of priority habitat areas 3 4 modeling water management strategies 3 4 1 sgma and defining total sustainable supply we assessed water management strategies based on new sgma requirements that local gsas formulate and implement gsps that would achieve sustainable groundwater management wat 10720 10735 california water code 2015 sgma defines sustainability as avoiding chronic lowering of groundwater levels indicating a significant and unreasonable depletion of supply groundwater storage seawater intrusion land subsidence and surface water depletions wat 10727 california water code 2015 basins ranked by the cdwr as high or medium priority due to chronic groundwater overdraft have until 2040 to achieve sustainability while low priority basins are exempt court adjudicated basins established prior to 2015 are largely exempt from these requirements but were included in our model because they generally have court mandates to reduce future overdraft and must provide reports to ensure consistency with sgma wat 10720 8 california water code 2015 sgma provides sustainability standards but leaves it to gsas to create gsps that implement new rules to achieve compliance to those standards within the central coast gsps included 1 demand side intervention programs to limit or reduce pumping only proposed in severely overdrafted basins and more commonly 2 increasing supplies to meet water demands e g conjunctive use of surface and groundwater recycling and desalination projects gsps must calculate a quantitative sustainable yield that incorporates the condition of water supplies projected climate change and societal considerations of undesirable impacts wat 10721 10727 california water code 2015 overdraft or surpluses may occur in any given year due to climate variability as long as the long term yield is sustainable approaches varied due to the diverse management strategies employed by gsas langridge and van schmidt 2020 we defined a parameter total sustainable supply as the total amount of water demand that can be sustained on average accounting for intra year variability without causing undesirable impacts on the groundwater subbasin this slightly broader definition includes not just the sustainable yield of aquifers but also other supplies e g water recycling and any further reductions that agencies used as management targets e g not exceeding 90 of their yield to generate a drought reserve we scaled up these local hydrological studies that accounted for diverse groundwater conditions into the regional lucas w model allowing us to develop a coupled model for the full central coast without data intensive modeling of aquifer dynamics van schmidt et al 2021 3 4 2 review of agency management plans we assessed demand reduction strategies and estimated total sustainable supply by reviewing all available draft or final gsps as well as adjudication documents annual reports technical reports and other relevant documents that identified sustainable yield and current or proposed management strategies langridge and van schmidt 2020 a list of data sources is in table a 1 we also interviewed staff from each agency to better understand proposed management changes and confirm our review s accuracy in lieu of validation with an external dataset appendix a 1 2 4 langridge and van schmidt 2020 response rate was high we corresponded with 22 of 27 81 regional water agencies we estimated two values of total sustainable supply in afy table a 1 accessible in model release of van schmidt et al 2021 first the current supply value included the long term average sustainable yield of groundwater plus other current or in progress water supplies e g surface water reservoirs a second enhanced supply value added water from projects that are projected in the future as part of gsps and which interviewees described as likely to be implemented factors determining total sustainable supply varied across basins due to differences in aquifers and management we did not explicitly model climate change because sustainable yield calculations in gsps generally accounted for climate change 3 4 3 water demand caps our first water management strategy water demand caps sought to limit estimated water demand within a gsa or adjudication s jurisdiction to its total sustainable supply by prohibiting new development and incentivizing the placement of agricultural contraction within basins in a condition of long term average overdraft of the 27 water agencies nine 33 had proposed plans to limit total water demand references in table a 1 for example salinas valley basin gsa proposed a cap and trade like program that provides economic incentives to gradually reduce pumping over time via a system of water allocations with associated cost tiers and exceedance charges salinas valley basin gsa 2020 this is a potentially transformative adaptation strategy because it adds a new feedback between water demand and supply these feedbacks were modeled in lucas w by coupling lucas to r v3 4 3 via st sim s external program functionality and the package rsyncrosim v1 2 4 r core team 2017 the submodel was turned off until 2024 which is the year when the salinas valley basin gsa the region s largest gsa planned to implement their pumping allocation system at the end of each simulated year from 2024 to 2061 per pixel water use is exported to r and summed across each water agency s management area if their sum water demand exceeded their total sustainable supply fig 2a three rules were enacted within that area 1 urbanization and agricultural expansion were prohibited spatial multiplier of 0 2 agricultural contraction was prioritized by an order of magnitude spatial multiplier of 10 and 3 agricultural intensification annual to perennial cropland was prohibited if it would increase water demand this third rule only applied to san benito county because all other counties perennial cropland was mostly vineyards which were less water intensive than their local annual crops fig a 1 this model made two key assumptions first the three rules only change where land use transitions occur not the underlying rates thus strategies that limit water demand within individual gsas will shift these land use changes into other areas within that county this assumption is made given the small scale of gsas management areas relative to national and global scale drivers of agricultural production demand lambin and meyfroidt 2011 second while not all agencies have proposed demand management regulations such limitations are still included in our model we make this assumption because if long term overdraft occurs by 2061 such restrictions would be necessary to ensure legal compliance with sgma which the state can intervene to enforce wat 10735 2 california water code 2015 3 4 4 water supply enhancement the second water supply enhancement strategy increased the total sustainable supply parameter from the current supply value to the enhanced supply value this is an adaptive strategy because it only alters the existing state variable without adding new couplings between system components walker et al 2006 of the 27 reviewed agencies half had no plans to develop further water supplies including 5 lower priority groundwater basins that had not yet developed their gsps table a 1 van schmidt et al 2021 3 5 modeling land use management strategies 3 5 1 land use planning objectives the following land use management strategies were considered to address stakeholder goals 1 preserving the best agricultural lands and recharge areas and 2 conservation of priority habitat areas to model these strategies we created spatial multipliers for lucas w to prohibit spatial multiplier 0 certain land use change transitions within target conservation areas these were in addition to local data on land use zoning planned developments and protected areas that had previously been incorporated into lucas wilson et al 2020 which were included in all scenarios assessed 3 5 2 urban sprawl limits two protections were included in limiting urban sprawl fig 2b first the preservation of prime farmland was modeled by prohibiting any new urbanization on areas ranked by the usda as prime farmland or farmland of statewide importance california dept of conservation 2016 second the protection of recharge areas from urbanization was modeled appendix a 1 2 5 van schmidt et al 2021 using soil spatial data and county maps of recharge areas table a 2 county of county of county of santa cruz information services department 2015 monterey county 2015 rmc water and environment 2015 soil survey staff 2014 3 5 3 ecosystem preservation lands identified by state and federal agencies as priorities for conservation were prevented from urbanization or agricultural expansion to conserve priority habitat areas fig 2c first we prohibited these transitions on critical habitats of all state and federally listed threatened species thorne et al 2019 second we prohibited them on areas identified as key habitat core areas or connecting corridors identified by a joint state agency conservation prioritization assessment california essential habitat connectivity spencer et al 2010 thorne et al 2019 3 6 designing the scenario analysis we used feedback from stakeholder workshops to group these land and water management strategies into five scenarios along two axes water management intensity low to high wl to wh and land use management intensity low to high ll to lh fig 3 we varied one management axis at a time to examine the influence of each strategy on land development patterns and groundwater sustainability separately we used a central moderate water management intensity moderate land use management intensity mm to serve as the intersection of these axes water management strategies were grouped into policies as follows wl a continuation of pre sgma business as usual strategies with no water demand limits mm added water demand caps to current supply within sgma regulated basins wh added water supply enhancement proposed in gsps increasing water caps to the enhanced supply value land management strategies were grouped as follows ll had no new land use strategies implemented but existing protected areas were included mm added urban sprawl limits that protected prime farmland and recharge areas lh added ecosystem preservation that prevented urbanization or cropland expansion on priority habitats 3 7 model analysis each scenario was run in lucas w over 60 annual time steps 2001 2061 during the spin up period covering the historic land use data 2001 2016 the actual annual land use change rates were used for example 2010 data was sampled deterministically from the observed rate in 2010 afterwards sampling was stochastic with the rate from one year from 1992 to 2016 chosen at random following sleeter et al 2017 and wilson et al 2020 we simulated 10 monte carlo replicates to capture variability in stochastic processes all strategies were first turned on in 2019 except for water demand feedbacks which were activated in 2024 model projections were post processed to assess the influence of management strategies on land use and water use across the 10 monte carlo replicates appendix a 1 2 6 spatial patterns of land use change were summarized as transition probability maps which represent the average annual probability of each transition occurring on each pixel from 2001 to 2061 across the 10 monte carlos daniel et al 2016 to assess the impact of management strategies we mapped places where the strategies made each land use transition more or less likely appendix a 1 3 4 results 4 1 regional change in land use overall land use projections show annual cropland will continue to decline from 2021 to 2061 contracting by 502 km2 mean across scenarios range 415 to 570 km2 fig 4a this will be outpaced by expansions of perennial cropland 549 km2 range 361 710 fig 4b and developed areas 370 km2 range 262 451 fig 4c the end result will be a mean total loss of 417 km2 of natural rangeland range 167 to 581 km2 fig 4d management scenarios altered the spatial patterning of where land use change occurs within counties not the underlying county specific rates of land use change therefore at regional scale the range of variability in projections within scenarios i e due to monte carlo stochasticity fig 4a d shaded areas was greater than the differences among the scenarios fig 4a d bold lines while there were county specific differences in the degree to which these changes occur by 2061 these general trends were present in all five counties fig 5 agricultural intensification and widespread replacement of annual cropland with perennial cropland were projected to be extensive within the large agricultural areas in salinas valley and santa maria valley the more rural san benito county continued to experience the greatest agricultural contraction resulting in a projected near total loss of annual cropland by 2061 4 2 regional change in water demand despite an overall loss of rangeland and the spread of developed land and perennial cropland most scenarios projected water demand to stay roughly the same over time fig 4e across scenarios the region wide mean change from 2021 to 2061 was 8916 afy range 66 354 to 70 563 afy while the acreage of new perennial cropland and developed areas significantly outpaced the acreage declines of annual cropland their growth in water demand did not because annual cropland was the most water intensive land use in every county but san benito fig a 1 van schmidt et al 2021 contracting annual cropland therefore led to a mean reduction in water demand of 311 886 afy range 356 251 to 264 334 afy that roughly balanced out increases in water demand for perennial cropland mean 267 876 afy range 191 257 333 205 and developed areas mean 52 927 afy range 39 110 67 651 assuming that the current region wide 9 1 ratio of domestic industrial water use continues maupin et al 2014 this equates to 47 046 afy of new domestic demand and 5881 afy of new industrial demand by 2061 scenarios showed little influence on region wide water demand the addition of water demand caps fig 4e wl vs mm did appear to slightly decrease the average water demand region wide with the mean of the no water caps wl scenario higher than the rest mean 35 745 however the difference was within the range of variability observed in the mm scenario with water demand caps 66 354 to 46 255 afy 4 3 effects of water management strategies 4 3 1 overdraft water demand caps were much more effective at reducing groundwater overdraft than water supply enhancement fig 6 to analyze the effect of water management strategies land management strategies were kept constant with only urban sprawl limits with current water supplies and without water demand caps i e business as usual nine subbasins were projected to remain in overdraft fig 6a adding water supply enhancements without demand caps was insufficient to significantly reduce overdraft in the context of future land use change achieving sustainability in only two basins fig 6b this may be because the enhanced supply represented only a relatively modest increase from the current supply only half of agencies planned supply enhancements and within those the average increase 15 4 table a 1 the addition of water demand caps to current supply successfully reduced groundwater overdraft in all basins and achieved sustainability in most basins fig 6c in the two basins that could not achieve sustainability with water demand caps alone pairing water demand caps with water supply enhancements further reduced projected overdraft fig 6d 4 3 2 percent change in water use water demand caps shifted development and associated water use from basins designated as high and medium priority by the cdwr to basins designated low priority which are not regulated by sgma fig 7a cdwr rankings were based on estimated overdraft and amount of development adding water supply enhancement produced a comparatively small effect major trends were 1 with no water demand caps fig 7a wl water use was projected to remain the same in unsustainable high priority basins 1 39 1 63 mean sd it notably increased in medium priority basins 9 94 3 23 and remained the same in low priority basins 3 49 6 56 2 capping water demand at current supply reversed these trends fig 7a mm water use fell by 13 77 1 30 in high priority basins remained near current levels in medium priority basins 2 44 2 95 and increased dramatically in low priority basins 41 79 22 23 overdraft fig 6 could not be calculated for low priority basins because these undeveloped basins aquifer characteristics are largely unknown 3 enhancing water supplies with water demand caps shifted the pattern of percent change to make it slightly more similar to the no caps scenario fig 7a wh vs mm the magnitude of the percent decrease in water use in high priority basins 10 76 1 34 was reduced from the mm scenario medium priority basins again showed a slight increase in water demand 4 33 4 06 the percent increase in low priority basins was smaller than in the mm scenario but still substantial 38 82 24 03 4 3 3 influence of water management on development patterns changing spatial patterns of development in response to water management strategies drove these trends without water demand caps agricultural expansion continued to be clustered in well developed groundwater basins around the fringes of current development fig 8a the addition of water demand caps wl mm pushed projected agricultural expansion fig 8b and urbanization fig a 6 out of well developed areas notably the critically overdrafted northern salinas valley paso robles area san antonio creek valley and cuyama valley growth was correspondingly intensified in less developed and mostly unregulated basins lockwood valley cholame valley peach tree valley and carrizo plain as well as within two regulated basins atascadero and southern santa maria valley fig 8b enhancing water supplies raised the water caps mm wh and once again intensified growth throughout the currently developed overdrafted areas particularly the northeastern salinas valley paso robles area and cuyama valley fig 8c there was then less agricultural growth in the undeveloped basins figures a 3 a 8 map the impact of water management strategies on the other lulc transitions 4 4 effects of land use management strategies 4 4 1 impact on water sustainability when assessing the influence of land use management strategies water management strategies were kept constant with water demand caps based on current supply limiting urban sprawl and priority habitat conservation together prevented water demand caps from causing leakage of water demand into relatively pristine unregulated low priority basins fig 7b 1 urban sprawl limits reduced the percent increase in water demand in low priority basins from 62 60 18 14 to 41 79 22 23 fig 7b ll vs mm further adding ecosystem preservation eliminated the increase 0 18 8 68 fig 7b lh these prohibitions on urbanization and agricultural expansion covered most of the current pristine rangeland of the central coast fig 2c 2 some of this water demand moved back into high priority basins fig 7b lh vs mm water use in high priority basins was still projected to decrease from current levels in the lh scenario 11 60 0 82 but the magnitude of this decrease was lower than in the mm scenario 13 77 1 30 limiting urban sprawl alone did not produce a notable overall effect on high priority basins with the change in the ll scenario 13 10 1 35 very close to the mm scenario fig 7b mm vs ll 3 high intensity land use management did not markedly hinder regional water sustainability overall with only one basin showing a statistically discernable increase in groundwater overdraft under these policies fig 6e f 4 4 2 influence of land use management on development patterns these trends were driven by changing spatial patterns of development in response to land use management without protecting prime farmland and groundwater recharge areas from urbanization ll development was most likely around city edges fig 9a adding urban sprawl limits ll mm reduced growth near cities surrounded by agriculture such as watsonville hollister santa maria and salinas as well as around smaller towns along the salinas valley to the south fig 9b development occurred instead in small rangeland towns and undeveloped groundwater basins particularly in parts of monterey county such as cholame valley fig 9b conserving areas prioritized by state habitat preservation goals mm lh had less impact on urbanization probability fig a 14 because urban areas were generally not near areas designated as priorities for preservation fig 2c rather it notably reduced agricultural growth in outlying rangeland areas lockwood valley cholame valley peach tree valley and carizzo plain moving it back into concentrated portions of current major agricultural areas such as the less overdrafted central salinas valley and around the city of paso robles fig 9c compare to fig 8 for baseline pattern of agricultural expansion in the santa maria valley protecting critical habitat for la graciosa thistle cirsium scariosum var loncholepis thorne et al 2019 concentrated development in the southwestern portion of the valley figures a 9 a 14 map the impact of land use management strategies on other land use transitions 5 discussion 5 1 management strategies for sustainable development our results suggest that demand management strategies under consideration by gsas could be widely effective at achieving aquifer sustainability based on current supply of water fig 6b these included programs designed to incentivize reduced withdrawals and fallow agricultural land in contrast solely enhancing supply performed little better than no interventions leaving most currently overdrafted basins in a state of overdraft fig 6a c similar results have been found for other semi arid regions of the world johannsen et al 2016 in california the water evaluation and planning system weap has been used to assess whether demand side interventions could achieve sustainability under land use change and climate change in the north coast mehta et al 2013 and central valley joyce et al 2006 2011 purkey et al 2008 this model simulated feedbacks between farmer s decision making on crop plantings and surface water availability and groundwater depth they found future water needs could be met only by combining both fallowing or shifting crops and increasing irrigation efficiency using drip irrigation however drip irrigation could reduce groundwater recharge mehta et al 2013 and is already utilized by vineyards the predominant driver of the agricultural growth projected for the central coast one issue is that water demand management strategies were also projected to cause leakage of agricultural development pressure lambin and meyfroidt 2011 to groundwater basins currently unregulated by sgma fig 8b this resulted in dramatic increases in water demand within these basins fig 7a which are relatively undeveloped potentially worsening local overdraft and degrading natural habitats these findings are corroborated by other recent studies liu et al 2017 priess et al 2011 at a global scale liu et al 2017 projected that cutting irrigation usage would cause leakage of cropland into other areas with sufficient water in semi arid mongolia priess et al 2011 found that constraining water use to availability would reduce crop yields and subsequently require a 10 increase in cultivated area their model site swim is the only other model that has included water and land use feedbacks between model water availability crop yields and subsequently farmer s fallowing decisions thus despite using completely different models these studies also predicted that demand side management can cause leakage of agricultural development importantly we found this leakage could be prevented by using land use planning to achieve major stakeholder goals the preservation of priority ecosystems recharge areas and prime farmland fig 9c moreover reducing rates of agricultural or urban development was not necessary to achieve sustainability fig 4a c rather it was theoretically feasible to achieve sustainability goals by strategic placement of cropland expansion and contraction within each county at the same rates they have occurred historically these results suggests that management strategies could work within existing socio economic forces driving changes in land use a combination of existing management options such as conservation easements implementation of laws protecting threatened species and zoning to cluster development could support such land use management similarly gao et al 2017 found that localized prohibitions on certain land uses in china could allow for agricultural expansion without significant new negative impacts alternatively liu et al 2017 simulated that inter basin water transfers could suppress leakage i e a supply side intervention our empirical model found water supply enhancement including water transfers which were used by some agencies see citations in table a 1 was much less effective at reducing leakage into undeveloped areas fig 8c than land use planning fig 9c imposing land use management did not significantly impede groundwater sustainability fig 6e f and intensive water management did not change overall projected rangeland loss fig 4d suggesting limited trade offs at a regional scale integrated water and land use management was thus projected to be a win win scenario for sustainable water agriculture and ecosystems figs 6 7 however 5 2 resilience theory and feedbacks in socio ecological systems theory supply side solutions are adaptive in nature because they alter existing state variables water supply but do not fundamentally change the linkages that control system behavior walker et al 2006 in california a recent disturbance the severe 2012 2016 drought led to a qualitative shift in the social system s controlling structures new sgma regulations but the water dependent development that accumulated during the unregulated historical exploitation period remains and continues to stress water supplies leahy 2016 while 33 of agencies planned management strategies to reduce or limit water demand supply side strategies were more common in gsps 50 of agencies table a 1 and citations therein these included water recycling and desalination plants conjunctive use programs removal of invasive species to reduce evapotranspiration and cloud seeding citations in table a 1 we argue supply side strategies risk treating water management as a steady state problem overdraft can be solved by adding additional water supplies until the new total inputs balance the unsustainable withdrawals they risk simply repeating a new cycle of exploitation of the enhanced resource fig 1 and were thus rarely sufficient for eliminating groundwater overdraft under future land use change fig 6b in contrast demand side strategies e g incentives to reduce development in overdrafted basins can be transformative because they alter the nature of the system by creating new cross scale linkages walker et al 2006 the new feedback between land use driven water demand and water supplies dramatically transformed patterns of future development fig 8 and fixed almost all overdraft fig 6 confirming our hypothesis that transformative demand side strategies would be more effective in producing long term water sustainability this supports a key tenet of socio ecological systems research that utilizing feedbacks and couplings to manage a system increases long term resilience kramer et al 2017 models exploring feedbacks between flooding and land use have likewise shown that development pathways that link these processes can greatly reduce eventual flood damages due to dynamic co evolution di baldassarre et al 2015 two previous models have simulated feedbacks between land use and water supplies joyce et al 2011 similarly showed that demand side management strategies more reliably achieved water sustainability in the face of climate uncertainty because feedbacks allowed water use to respond flexibly to the unpredictable future climate however groundwater dependent regions had reduced demand side feedbacks because increasing depth to groundwater was not an economically meaningful constraint on growers decision making in the absence of policy incentives joyce et al 2006 yalew et al 2018 also found that including such feedbacks only marginally improved model fit both previous approaches modeled feedbacks based on individual farmer s decision making rather than the broader scale of agency management we assessed the contrast in results between these studies and ours suggests that institutions may create stronger feedbacks than purely economic drivers 5 3 trends in land use and water use uncertainty in future projections is greater than the modeled range of projected land use changes i e fig 4 because uncertainty also arises from input parameters and data collection model design choices and assumptions and errors in model construction evans 2012 we have therefore focused on assessing system dynamics rather than predicting a precise future state huss 1988 but we here briefly discuss our historic and projected rates of land use change historic land use change showed an overall expansion of development but with declining annual cropland balancing the expansion of perennial cropland and developed areas these trends have been measured elsewhere in california anderson et al 2018 and other highly developed agricultural regions of the united states schilling et al 2008 our average projection of rangeland loss from 2021 to 2061 of 417 km2 fig 4c was greater than the 195 km2 projected by the earlier lucas version wilson et al 2020 this was due to the removal of an assumption that prevented perennial cropland from growing when annual cropland became locally scarce in the future which improved model performance appendix a 1 2 2 we projected 370 km2 of new domestic and industrial development from 2021 to 2061 fig 2c a 22 increase that was close to the state s 19 projected population increase 291 438 individuals over the same timeframe california dept of finance 2018 stakeholders reported that housing shortages are already an issue which the urban sprawl limits strategy to protect prime farmland could exacerbate by shifting urbanization away from major cities and into outlying rangeland towns fig 9 we estimated little change in total water use from current levels fig 4e which may have assisted the ability of demand caps to achieve sustainability the earlier version of lucas wilson et al 2020 predicted regional expansions of water demand exceeding 1 million afy however these models used different parameterization methods that we found overestimated perennial water demand and performed poorly in validation tests compared to the revised methods used in this paper appendix a 1 2 3 while the projected shift from annual to perennial cropland results in significant average year water savings fig 4e perennial crops cannot be easily fallowed and live for decades this could increase vulnerability by creating an inflexible water demand during drought anderson et al 2018 5 4 modeling approach and limitations land use models have generally not included social hydrological or climate feedbacks chen et al 2016 we used multiple local agencies groundwater modeling efforts to estimate a key parameter total sustainable supply which we could directly link to estimated historical water use rates and scale up to regional scale coupled projections of land use change and water sustainability this participatory approach enabled the incorporation of local knowledge about heterogeneous aquifers and management strategies into lucas w our focus on understanding feedbacks driven by governance structures aligns our work in the emerging field of socio hydrology di baldassarre et al 2015 pan et al 2018 and complements earlier feedback models that focused on farmer level decision making joyce et al 2006 priess et al 2011 a key caveat is that we could not quantitatively validate the accuracy of lucas w s projections under proposed management strategies including how realistically the model simulated the feedbacks introduced by water demand caps because these were hypothetical future policies that have not existed historically barlas 1996 leahy 2016 messina et al 2008 lucas w performed well at estimating water demand over the historic period with predicted values generally within 10 of values from independent datatsets fig a 2 for future projections and novel management scenarios barlas 1996 suggest examining whether long term patterns in graphs qualitatively match known or reasonable behavior as expected trajectories of future land use change under all five scenarios smoothly continued along historical trends without any dramatic shift in behavior fig 4a d or major deviations in water use fig 4e nevertheless lucas w s outputs should be viewed as resulting from the empirical input data under the specific assumptions of the model not a precise prediction of a future state in the coming decades empirical research comparing areas with and without demand caps under sgma could confirm whether lucas w s outcomes are accurate we assumed water use per km2 stays the same within each anthropogenic land use class precluding water demand changes due to shifts in cropland types due to changing global dietary preferences aleksandrowicz et al 2016 improvements in water use efficiency mehta et al 2013 or increasing evapotranspiration under climate change wada et al 2012 we found efficiency improvements were not a major strategy in most gsps and therefore assumed decreases in efficiency improvement and increases due to evaporative water demand under climate change would balance out nevertheless farmers could respond to gsp regulations by adopting more efficient irrigation or converting to less water intensive crops joyce et al 2011 purkey et al 2008 likewise our use of area based transition targets for new developed land use prevented the assessment of infill housing developments a major focus of current land use planning landis et al 2006 integrating infill development to assess housing needs will be a useful component of future development and future analyses could explore the sensitivity of our lucas w model to alternate trends in development and applied water needs complex interrelationships between climate land use and water use make projecting the future of such systems very difficult and our model makes key simplifications that limit its realism stonestrom et al 2009 land use alters the hydrologic cycle at fundamental levels altering evapotranspiration precipitation and temperatures runoff and recharge anderson et al 2018 calder et al 2003 feddema et al 2005 kueppers et al 2007 pielke et al 2007 spera et al 2016 these potential feedbacks were not included in our models our estimates of groundwater sustainability within specific basins are not substitutes for the detailed hydrological studies that water agencies conducted to create their management plans rather we view these approaches as complementary many hydrological models can ingest land use scenarios as inputs and then simulate more detailed aquifer and management dynamics johannsen et al 2016 öztürk et al 2013 tong et al 2012 these models are data intensive and challenging to parameterize at a regional scale but their outputs can feed into lucas w our regional model can in turn produce annual land use projections under a range of development trajectories and corresponding estimates of water sustainability that are uniquely informed by regional scale linkages coupling these approaches into a dynamic cross scale model would be a promising direction for future research 6 conclusions we showed that water demand caps could largely achieve sustainability with current water supplies whereas solely enhancing supply may not water demand management strategies caused leakage of agricultural land development pressure to groundwater basins currently unregulated by sgma dramatically increasing local water demand land use management strategies particularly prioritizing habitat conservation could prevent leakage into pristine areas these results suggest california s central coast has high adaptive capacity to cope with future changes via coordinated water and land use planning our assessment did not consider the vulnerabilities of different regions changes in water efficiency or housing density sensitivity of results to different possible land use futures grower decision making or feedbacks between land use and hydrological processes e g recharge ongoing research efforts include comprehensive vulnerability assessment including regional sensitivities and integrating housing density into projections future work could integrate lucas w with other hydrological models to assess a broader range of feedbacks by working with stakeholders to scale up local hydrological studies and management strategies into a regional scale land use model we were able to incorporate governance mediated feedbacks between land use and water availability parameterizing lucas w with actual management plans allowed us to more realistically assess the relative potential of land use and water management strategies to achieve water sustainability and prevent leakage which can inform implementation of sgma throughout california this approach is readily extensible to other regions where water supply and demand is

reorganization of groundwater management under california s 2014 sustainable groundwater management act sgma study focus understanding land use and land cover change supports long term sustainable water management anthropogenic water demand has depleted groundwater aquifers worldwide while future water shortages will likely affect land use change creating system feedbacks our novel participatory approach fused changes in land use and associated water use from county scale data to local water agencies estimates of total sustainable supply scaling up local hydro geologic knowledge from heterogeneous aquifers and diverse management approaches to a regional level we assessed five stakeholder driven scenarios with the same historic rates of urban and agricultural land use change but different water and land use management analyzing how management strategies altered both the spatial pattern of development and subsequent water sustainability from 2001 to 2061 new hydrological insights for the region transformative strategies using demand side interventions that coupled water availability to land use more effectively achieved long term sustainability than adaptive strategies using supply side interventions to increase water supplies limiting water withdrawals within sgma regulated basins resulted in leakage of development into unregulated basins increasing groundwater pumping there protecting ecosystems farmlands and recharge areas from development reduced leakage into undeveloped basins without negatively affecting water sustainability graphical

essential life sustaining resource for billions of people worldwide providing a buffer against precipitation variability and water shortages during drought fao 2016 however many groundwater basins worldwide are already experiencing ongoing and long term declines in groundwater levels famiglietti 2014 stonestrom et al 2009 wada et al 2012 chronic groundwater overdraft where water extractions exceed recharge can cause loss of water quality saltwater intrusion land subsidence and the drying of groundwater dependent ecosystems and elimination of fish and wildlife populations that depend on them kløve et al 2011 moreover there can be disproportionate impacts on socio economically disadvantaged communities which rely on the resource dobbin 2018 the sustainable management of groundwater is inextricably linked to land use land cover hereafter land use for brevity change and the long term resilience of local communities agricultural expansion and urbanization will further deplete groundwater supplies wilson et al 2016 and future water shortages will likely in turn affect land use change creating feedbacks within the system biggs et al 2010 venot et al 2010 despite the importance of feedbacks most integrated models of land use and hydrology have only used one way couplings chen et al 2016 yalew et al 2018 hydrological models frequently estimate changes in runoff recharge transpiration and other watershed processes under different external land use scenarios bhaduri et al 2000 fohrer et al 2001 karvonen et al 1999 tong et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 land use change models rarely simulate hydrology de rosa et al 2016 and when they have included hydrological components it has often been a one way assessment of impacts c f howells et al 2013 liu et al 2017 modeling feedbacks is particularly important for predicting how systems will respond to policy change chen et al 2016 including adequate institutional rules and management strategies to address groundwater depletion and achieve water sustainability foster and garduño 2013 socio hydrology has emerged as a relatively new discipline that uses models to understand the dynamic feedbacks between water systems and human systems di baldassarre et al 2015 pan et al 2018 california is an ideal location for studying the linkages between land use groundwater and potentially transformative governance following the state s passage in 2014 of the sustainable groundwater management act sgma this law mandates the formation of new groundwater sustainability agencies gsas for the state s 127 groundwater basins in unsustainable overdraft these agencies must develop groundwater sustainability plans gsps to manage their basins wat 10720 10735 california water code 2015 this process is overseen by the california dept of water resources cdwr our study site was california s central coast a region with agriculture dominated valleys coastal tourist oases and extensive unique natural lands langridge 2018 ongoing development which we define as the conversion of rangelands to cropland of rangelands and cropland to domestic or industrial uses and of annual crops to higher value perennial vineyards and orchards presents challenges in planning for future water supplies wilson et al 2020 these problems may be exacerbated under climate change with higher temperatures and more extreme droughts projected to reduce surface water supplies and affect groundwater recharge langridge 2018 the region will likely be profoundly impacted by sgma local groundwater basins make up 86 of the average water supply and over 40 are already in overdraft cdwr 2015 martin 2013 we created a regional coupled model of land use and water use lucas w ater to assess potential development pathways for california s central coast from 2001 to 2061 at 270 meter resolution appendix s1 1 provides a stand alone document with detailed methods describing the parameterization of the model and the finished model and spatial data are available as data releases van schmidt et al 2021 lucas w was empirically fit from historic land use rates and local hydrology studies we worked with local water agencies land use planners and other stakeholders to create a scenario based approach identifying vulnerabilities and adaptive capacity under multiple plausible futures appendix s1 1 1 our focus in this paper is not on exploring alternative economic development pathways scenarios held the underlying historical rates of land use change constant or predicting a precise future state a task that is challenging and impossible to validate for land use change models messina et al 2008 rather we sought to assess the central coast s adaptive capacity by modeling how management strategies proposed under sgma could work with local zoning strategies to alter the spatial pattern of land use change and associated stress on water systems at a regional scale our goal was exploring possible future solution spaces where novel processes could change historic trajectories messina et al 2008 following predictions of resilience theory walker et al 2006 we hypothesized that management strategies using demand side interventions would be more capable of mitigating long term overdraft than supply side interventions because the former are transformative they add new couplings between water usage and water sustainability while the latter are only adaptive they alter a water supply variable to adjust to a specific water need walker et al 2006 2 theory we use a resilience theory framework to tackle two central questions for socio ecological systems research 1 how will land use patterns change with ongoing changes in water availability and 2 what is the role of reciprocal relationships i e couplings and feedbacks in transforming systems from fragile configurations into resilient ones kramer et al 2017 resilience theory is a broad interdisciplinary approach combining examinations of complex system behavior effective governance cooperation and social learning bakker and morinville 2013 folke 2006 walker et al 2006 resilience scholars use the adaptive cycle fig 1 top as a conceptual model to understand the dynamics of socio ecological systems folke 2006 systems adapt by alternating between long periods of resilient growth exploitation and accumulation of resource dependent structures that cause fragility conservation and shorter periods of disturbance induced change release and restructuring to a new normal reorganization after which the cycle repeats gunderson and holling 2002 in california groundwater management can be aligned with the adaptive cycle fig 1 bottom groundwater extraction historically had little coordinated institutional oversight an exploitation phase where abundant resources increased water dependent developed leahy 2016 this led to a conservation phase where the development s accumulated water demands created increasing rigidity political resistance to statewide regulations and fragility groundwater declines in many basins leahy 2016 a severe 2012 2016 drought led to a release phase of disturbance induced change wherein the unsustainable demands contributed to unprecedented well failures water shortages and emergency water restrictions leahy 2016 these pressures contributed to the passage in 2014 of sgma wat 10720 10737 8 california water code 2015 marking the reorganization phase with the potential for transformative new sustainable groundwater management leahy 2016 resilience theory states that management strategies that only alter the system s existing state variables e g supply side strategies that only change the amount of water in the system are adaptive in nature these are hypothesized to be less capable of achieving sustainability than strategies that transform system function by adding new linkages walker et al 2006 thus resilience theory predicts that demand side sgma strategies which newly link water sustainability to land use should be more effective at achieving long term sustainability 3 material and methods 3 1 study area california s central coast is a 28 534 km2 region covering five counties santa cruz san benito monterey san luis obispo and santa barbara the mediterranean climate has hot dry summers and cool wet winters it is a global hotspot of biodiversity with high potential vulnerability to climate change langridge 2018 rundel et al 2016 at the region s center is the salinas valley an agricultural area of national importance and the city of salinas the central coast s largest municipality population of 158 000 monterey county farm bureau 2018 it is among the region s 48 cities or census areas classified by the state as disadvantaged communities california epa 2018 and the 68 census areas at risk for water inaffordability mack and wrase 2017 many of which are economically disadvantaged agricultural communities water use is dominated by agriculture and water demand varies significantly across crop types allan et al 1998 in some areas such as the paso robles region a rapid transition from rangeland to perennial agriculture has changed underlying groundwater basins from stable to critically overdrafted in a decade giffin et al 2011 groundwater depletion has caused the drying of wells and seawater intrusion into aquifers monterey county water resources agency 2017 land use change models project significant expansions of agricultural and urban areas by the end of the century that will likely worsen groundwater overdraft wilson et al 2016 2017 2020 these trends threaten the region s extensive undeveloped distinctive coastal grassland and shrubland ecosystems including areas surrounding national and state parks and major tourist destinations such as the big sur coast wilson et al 2020 development and falling groundwater tables jointly imperil endangered species such as california red legged frogs rana draytonii and the southwestern willow flycatcher empidonax traillii extimus u s fish and wildlife service 2002a 2002b 3 2 the lucas w model 3 2 1 modeling framework our land use change model lucas w van schmidt et al 2021 is a modified version of the lucas model land use and carbon scenario simulator sleeter et al 2015 wilson et al 2016 2017 2020 a spatially explicit empirical state and transition simulation model developed in the st sim package of program syncrosim v2 2 13 apexrms 2019 daniel et al 2016 the model divides the landscape into spatially discrete simulation cells i e a raster each with assigned land use state classes that can change annually each anthropogenic land use class is attributed with an historic area based water use estimate enabling land use projections to track related water demand over the scenario simulations wilson et al 2016 we previously developed a lucas model specifically for the central coast at 270 m resolution 391 421 cells wilson et al 2020 which we updated to create lucas w each cell is also attributed to a 1 county 2 gsa and adjudicated basin management area and 3 groundwater basin based on data from cdwr 2015b 3 2 2 land use change parameterization the following land use classes formed the initial landscape conditions in the lucas w model rangeland forest wetland water barren transportation developed i e residential or industrial and perennial cropland and annual cropland and appendix a 1 2 1 these land use classes could change with the following land use transitions urbanization rangeland or annual perennial cropland converting into developed agricultural expansion rangeland to annual perennial cropland agricultural contraction annual perennial cropland to rangeland and agricultural intensification annual cropland to perennial cropland we refer to all anthropogenic land use changes as development for brevity but italicize developed when referring to the specific modeled land use class the rates of transitions are set as county specific annual targets randomly sampled from distributions of historical rates observed from 1992 to 2016 appendix a 1 2 2 in the five counties historic land use conversion data tables obtained from california department of conservation 2017 transitions are stochastically placed based on adjacency rules and spatial multipliers that prevent or prioritize land use transitions within certain areas daniel et al 2016 3 2 3 water demand parameterization to parameterize lucas w s water demand developed annual cropland and perennial cropland cells were attributed with county specific water demand values in acre feet per year afy 1 acre foot 1233 5 m3 per km2 for each cell fig a 1 appendix a 1 2 3 wilson et al 2016 2017 2020 developed water use represented both domestic and industrial demand and was estimated from maupin et al 2014 cropland water use was based on the cdwr agricultural land and water use 1998 2010 dataset cdwr 2014 3 2 4 model validation we followed standard approaches to validation in system dynamics research by performing validation tests over the historic period prior to the management strategy analysis stage barlas 1996 we first performed structure validation by rigorously proofing the model and resulting datasets with internal testing and an external data and code review our process was iterative and we made revisions to the model parameterization and structure described in appendix a 1 1 a 1 2 3 until the model achieved reasonable validation we next performed empirical structure tests barlas 1996 by simulating the historic period using each year s actual annual rate of land use change from the 1992 2016 data california dept of conservation 2017 inspection of outputs showed that the model simulated the input historic rates of land use change nearly 1 1 r2 0 99 for expected vs observed rates 2001 2016 mean over 10 iterations van schmidt et al 2021 lucas w accurately predicted total land use and associated water demand when comparing our modeled estimates of county wide water demand to independent external datasets we compared lucas w s projected annual cropland perennial cropland water demand estimates to independent usgs 2005 and 2010 datasets maupin et al 2014 the mean cropland error across counties and time periods was 7800 afy rmse 30 847 afy equivalent to 4 1 of the water use of a county on average fig a 2a we compared lucas w s developed water demand estimates to an independent cdwr dataset from 2005 to 2010 cdwr 2014 the mean developed error was 4637 afy rmse 7403 afy equivalent to 8 9 of the water use of a county on average fig a 2b for all measures there was no clear trend of over or underestimation across counties fig a 2 the model s estimates therefore reasonably represented independent empirical estimates validating the model quantitative validation of the accuracy of future projections and management strategy impacts was not possible because these represented hypothetical futures a common issue in such models messina et al 2008 in lieu of external quantitative validation a process based approach of engaging with stakeholders in participatory workshops and interviews has been recommended as an alternative way to ensure models reasonably represent real world dynamics and emerging policies messina et al 2008 moss 2008 we did this via interviews and workshops with agency staff during model design parameterization and presentation of results 3 3 participatory scenario development we used a stakeholder driven scenario development approach to create an evidence based body of research about the impacts of specific land use and water management adaptation strategies we held a series of six meetings with local institutions and non profits hereafter stakeholders to oversee model development identify local priorities and potential adaptations for land and water management and aid in interpretation of results appendix a 1 1 meetings were informal discussions with no quantitative data gathered partners included the california climate change collaborative a network of diverse organizations representatives from the city of salinas and other city and county land use agencies and the elkhorn slough foundation an environmental non profit stakeholders identified the following water sustainability goals 1 sufficient water especially during drought 2 reduce or halt groundwater level declines and 3 reduce water pollution key sustainable land use goals were 1 address the loss of prime farmland 2 maintain healthy ecosystems and 3 develop sufficient low and medium income housing quantitative modeling of strategies to address low and medium income housing needs were determined to be beyond the scope of this study we identified two water and two land management strategies to quantitatively assess for their ability to achieve regional sustainability and to identify any tradeoffs between these different goals water management strategies were 1 demand side interventions to reduce water dependent development in overdrafted areas and 2 supply side interventions to increase water supplies land use management strategies were 3 preserving the best agricultural lands and recharge areas and 4 conservation of priority habitat areas 3 4 modeling water management strategies 3 4 1 sgma and defining total sustainable supply we assessed water management strategies based on new sgma requirements that local gsas formulate and implement gsps that would achieve sustainable groundwater management wat 10720 10735 california water code 2015 sgma defines sustainability as avoiding chronic lowering of groundwater levels indicating a significant and unreasonable depletion of supply groundwater storage seawater intrusion land subsidence and surface water depletions wat 10727 california water code 2015 basins ranked by the cdwr as high or medium priority due to chronic groundwater overdraft have until 2040 to achieve sustainability while low priority basins are exempt court adjudicated basins established prior to 2015 are largely exempt from these requirements but were included in our model because they generally have court mandates to reduce future overdraft and must provide reports to ensure consistency with sgma wat 10720 8 california water code 2015 sgma provides sustainability standards but leaves it to gsas to create gsps that implement new rules to achieve compliance to those standards within the central coast gsps included 1 demand side intervention programs to limit or reduce pumping only proposed in severely overdrafted basins and more commonly 2 increasing supplies to meet water demands e g conjunctive use of surface and groundwater recycling and desalination projects gsps must calculate a quantitative sustainable yield that incorporates the condition of water supplies projected climate change and societal considerations of undesirable impacts wat 10721 10727 california water code 2015 overdraft or surpluses may occur in any given year due to climate variability as long as the long term yield is sustainable approaches varied due to the diverse management strategies employed by gsas langridge and van schmidt 2020 we defined a parameter total sustainable supply as the total amount of water demand that can be sustained on average accounting for intra year variability without causing undesirable impacts on the groundwater subbasin this slightly broader definition includes not just the sustainable yield of aquifers but also other supplies e g water recycling and any further reductions that agencies used as management targets e g not exceeding 90 of their yield to generate a drought reserve we scaled up these local hydrological studies that accounted for diverse groundwater conditions into the regional lucas w model allowing us to develop a coupled model for the full central coast without data intensive modeling of aquifer dynamics van schmidt et al 2021 3 4 2 review of agency management plans we assessed demand reduction strategies and estimated total sustainable supply by reviewing all available draft or final gsps as well as adjudication documents annual reports technical reports and other relevant documents that identified sustainable yield and current or proposed management strategies langridge and van schmidt 2020 a list of data sources is in table a 1 we also interviewed staff from each agency to better understand proposed management changes and confirm our review s accuracy in lieu of validation with an external dataset appendix a 1 2 4 langridge and van schmidt 2020 response rate was high we corresponded with 22 of 27 81 regional water agencies we estimated two values of total sustainable supply in afy table a 1 accessible in model release of van schmidt et al 2021 first the current supply value included the long term average sustainable yield of groundwater plus other current or in progress water supplies e g surface water reservoirs a second enhanced supply value added water from projects that are projected in the future as part of gsps and which interviewees described as likely to be implemented factors determining total sustainable supply varied across basins due to differences in aquifers and management we did not explicitly model climate change because sustainable yield calculations in gsps generally accounted for climate change 3 4 3 water demand caps our first water management strategy water demand caps sought to limit estimated water demand within a gsa or adjudication s jurisdiction to its total sustainable supply by prohibiting new development and incentivizing the placement of agricultural contraction within basins in a condition of long term average overdraft of the 27 water agencies nine 33 had proposed plans to limit total water demand references in table a 1 for example salinas valley basin gsa proposed a cap and trade like program that provides economic incentives to gradually reduce pumping over time via a system of water allocations with associated cost tiers and exceedance charges salinas valley basin gsa 2020 this is a potentially transformative adaptation strategy because it adds a new feedback between water demand and supply these feedbacks were modeled in lucas w by coupling lucas to r v3 4 3 via st sim s external program functionality and the package rsyncrosim v1 2 4 r core team 2017 the submodel was turned off until 2024 which is the year when the salinas valley basin gsa the region s largest gsa planned to implement their pumping allocation system at the end of each simulated year from 2024 to 2061 per pixel water use is exported to r and summed across each water agency s management area if their sum water demand exceeded their total sustainable supply fig 2a three rules were enacted within that area 1 urbanization and agricultural expansion were prohibited spatial multiplier of 0 2 agricultural contraction was prioritized by an order of magnitude spatial multiplier of 10 and 3 agricultural intensification annual to perennial cropland was prohibited if it would increase water demand this third rule only applied to san benito county because all other counties perennial cropland was mostly vineyards which were less water intensive than their local annual crops fig a 1 this model made two key assumptions first the three rules only change where land use transitions occur not the underlying rates thus strategies that limit water demand within individual gsas will shift these land use changes into other areas within that county this assumption is made given the small scale of gsas management areas relative to national and global scale drivers of agricultural production demand lambin and meyfroidt 2011 second while not all agencies have proposed demand management regulations such limitations are still included in our model we make this assumption because if long term overdraft occurs by 2061 such restrictions would be necessary to ensure legal compliance with sgma which the state can intervene to enforce wat 10735 2 california water code 2015 3 4 4 water supply enhancement the second water supply enhancement strategy increased the total sustainable supply parameter from the current supply value to the enhanced supply value this is an adaptive strategy because it only alters the existing state variable without adding new couplings between system components walker et al 2006 of the 27 reviewed agencies half had no plans to develop further water supplies including 5 lower priority groundwater basins that had not yet developed their gsps table a 1 van schmidt et al 2021 3 5 modeling land use management strategies 3 5 1 land use planning objectives the following land use management strategies were considered to address stakeholder goals 1 preserving the best agricultural lands and recharge areas and 2 conservation of priority habitat areas to model these strategies we created spatial multipliers for lucas w to prohibit spatial multiplier 0 certain land use change transitions within target conservation areas these were in addition to local data on land use zoning planned developments and protected areas that had previously been incorporated into lucas wilson et al 2020 which were included in all scenarios assessed 3 5 2 urban sprawl limits two protections were included in limiting urban sprawl fig 2b first the preservation of prime farmland was modeled by prohibiting any new urbanization on areas ranked by the usda as prime farmland or farmland of statewide importance california dept of conservation 2016 second the protection of recharge areas from urbanization was modeled appendix a 1 2 5 van schmidt et al 2021 using soil spatial data and county maps of recharge areas table a 2 county of county of county of santa cruz information services department 2015 monterey county 2015 rmc water and environment 2015 soil survey staff 2014 3 5 3 ecosystem preservation lands identified by state and federal agencies as priorities for conservation were prevented from urbanization or agricultural expansion to conserve priority habitat areas fig 2c first we prohibited these transitions on critical habitats of all state and federally listed threatened species thorne et al 2019 second we prohibited them on areas identified as key habitat core areas or connecting corridors identified by a joint state agency conservation prioritization assessment california essential habitat connectivity spencer et al 2010 thorne et al 2019 3 6 designing the scenario analysis we used feedback from stakeholder workshops to group these land and water management strategies into five scenarios along two axes water management intensity low to high wl to wh and land use management intensity low to high ll to lh fig 3 we varied one management axis at a time to examine the influence of each strategy on land development patterns and groundwater sustainability separately we used a central moderate water management intensity moderate land use management intensity mm to serve as the intersection of these axes water management strategies were grouped into policies as follows wl a continuation of pre sgma business as usual strategies with no water demand limits mm added water demand caps to current supply within sgma regulated basins wh added water supply enhancement proposed in gsps increasing water caps to the enhanced supply value land management strategies were grouped as follows ll had no new land use strategies implemented but existing protected areas were included mm added urban sprawl limits that protected prime farmland and recharge areas lh added ecosystem preservation that prevented urbanization or cropland expansion on priority habitats 3 7 model analysis each scenario was run in lucas w over 60 annual time steps 2001 2061 during the spin up period covering the historic land use data 2001 2016 the actual annual land use change rates were used for example 2010 data was sampled deterministically from the observed rate in 2010 afterwards sampling was stochastic with the rate from one year from 1992 to 2016 chosen at random following sleeter et al 2017 and wilson et al 2020 we simulated 10 monte carlo replicates to capture variability in stochastic processes all strategies were first turned on in 2019 except for water demand feedbacks which were activated in 2024 model projections were post processed to assess the influence of management strategies on land use and water use across the 10 monte carlo replicates appendix a 1 2 6 spatial patterns of land use change were summarized as transition probability maps which represent the average annual probability of each transition occurring on each pixel from 2001 to 2061 across the 10 monte carlos daniel et al 2016 to assess the impact of management strategies we mapped places where the strategies made each land use transition more or less likely appendix a 1 3 4 results 4 1 regional change in land use overall land use projections show annual cropland will continue to decline from 2021 to 2061 contracting by 502 km2 mean across scenarios range 415 to 570 km2 fig 4a this will be outpaced by expansions of perennial cropland 549 km2 range 361 710 fig 4b and developed areas 370 km2 range 262 451 fig 4c the end result will be a mean total loss of 417 km2 of natural rangeland range 167 to 581 km2 fig 4d management scenarios altered the spatial patterning of where land use change occurs within counties not the underlying county specific rates of land use change therefore at regional scale the range of variability in projections within scenarios i e due to monte carlo stochasticity fig 4a d shaded areas was greater than the differences among the scenarios fig 4a d bold lines while there were county specific differences in the degree to which these changes occur by 2061 these general trends were present in all five counties fig 5 agricultural intensification and widespread replacement of annual cropland with perennial cropland were projected to be extensive within the large agricultural areas in salinas valley and santa maria valley the more rural san benito county continued to experience the greatest agricultural contraction resulting in a projected near total loss of annual cropland by 2061 4 2 regional change in water demand despite an overall loss of rangeland and the spread of developed land and perennial cropland most scenarios projected water demand to stay roughly the same over time fig 4e across scenarios the region wide mean change from 2021 to 2061 was 8916 afy range 66 354 to 70 563 afy while the acreage of new perennial cropland and developed areas significantly outpaced the acreage declines of annual cropland their growth in water demand did not because annual cropland was the most water intensive land use in every county but san benito fig a 1 van schmidt et al 2021 contracting annual cropland therefore led to a mean reduction in water demand of 311 886 afy range 356 251 to 264 334 afy that roughly balanced out increases in water demand for perennial cropland mean 267 876 afy range 191 257 333 205 and developed areas mean 52 927 afy range 39 110 67 651 assuming that the current region wide 9 1 ratio of domestic industrial water use continues maupin et al 2014 this equates to 47 046 afy of new domestic demand and 5881 afy of new industrial demand by 2061 scenarios showed little influence on region wide water demand the addition of water demand caps fig 4e wl vs mm did appear to slightly decrease the average water demand region wide with the mean of the no water caps wl scenario higher than the rest mean 35 745 however the difference was within the range of variability observed in the mm scenario with water demand caps 66 354 to 46 255 afy 4 3 effects of water management strategies 4 3 1 overdraft water demand caps were much more effective at reducing groundwater overdraft than water supply enhancement fig 6 to analyze the effect of water management strategies land management strategies were kept constant with only urban sprawl limits with current water supplies and without water demand caps i e business as usual nine subbasins were projected to remain in overdraft fig 6a adding water supply enhancements without demand caps was insufficient to significantly reduce overdraft in the context of future land use change achieving sustainability in only two basins fig 6b this may be because the enhanced supply represented only a relatively modest increase from the current supply only half of agencies planned supply enhancements and within those the average increase 15 4 table a 1 the addition of water demand caps to current supply successfully reduced groundwater overdraft in all basins and achieved sustainability in most basins fig 6c in the two basins that could not achieve sustainability with water demand caps alone pairing water demand caps with water supply enhancements further reduced projected overdraft fig 6d 4 3 2 percent change in water use water demand caps shifted development and associated water use from basins designated as high and medium priority by the cdwr to basins designated low priority which are not regulated by sgma fig 7a cdwr rankings were based on estimated overdraft and amount of development adding water supply enhancement produced a comparatively small effect major trends were 1 with no water demand caps fig 7a wl water use was projected to remain the same in unsustainable high priority basins 1 39 1 63 mean sd it notably increased in medium priority basins 9 94 3 23 and remained the same in low priority basins 3 49 6 56 2 capping water demand at current supply reversed these trends fig 7a mm water use fell by 13 77 1 30 in high priority basins remained near current levels in medium priority basins 2 44 2 95 and increased dramatically in low priority basins 41 79 22 23 overdraft fig 6 could not be calculated for low priority basins because these undeveloped basins aquifer characteristics are largely unknown 3 enhancing water supplies with water demand caps shifted the pattern of percent change to make it slightly more similar to the no caps scenario fig 7a wh vs mm the magnitude of the percent decrease in water use in high priority basins 10 76 1 34 was reduced from the mm scenario medium priority basins again showed a slight increase in water demand 4 33 4 06 the percent increase in low priority basins was smaller than in the mm scenario but still substantial 38 82 24 03 4 3 3 influence of water management on development patterns changing spatial patterns of development in response to water management strategies drove these trends without water demand caps agricultural expansion continued to be clustered in well developed groundwater basins around the fringes of current development fig 8a the addition of water demand caps wl mm pushed projected agricultural expansion fig 8b and urbanization fig a 6 out of well developed areas notably the critically overdrafted northern salinas valley paso robles area san antonio creek valley and cuyama valley growth was correspondingly intensified in less developed and mostly unregulated basins lockwood valley cholame valley peach tree valley and carrizo plain as well as within two regulated basins atascadero and southern santa maria valley fig 8b enhancing water supplies raised the water caps mm wh and once again intensified growth throughout the currently developed overdrafted areas particularly the northeastern salinas valley paso robles area and cuyama valley fig 8c there was then less agricultural growth in the undeveloped basins figures a 3 a 8 map the impact of water management strategies on the other lulc transitions 4 4 effects of land use management strategies 4 4 1 impact on water sustainability when assessing the influence of land use management strategies water management strategies were kept constant with water demand caps based on current supply limiting urban sprawl and priority habitat conservation together prevented water demand caps from causing leakage of water demand into relatively pristine unregulated low priority basins fig 7b 1 urban sprawl limits reduced the percent increase in water demand in low priority basins from 62 60 18 14 to 41 79 22 23 fig 7b ll vs mm further adding ecosystem preservation eliminated the increase 0 18 8 68 fig 7b lh these prohibitions on urbanization and agricultural expansion covered most of the current pristine rangeland of the central coast fig 2c 2 some of this water demand moved back into high priority basins fig 7b lh vs mm water use in high priority basins was still projected to decrease from current levels in the lh scenario 11 60 0 82 but the magnitude of this decrease was lower than in the mm scenario 13 77 1 30 limiting urban sprawl alone did not produce a notable overall effect on high priority basins with the change in the ll scenario 13 10 1 35 very close to the mm scenario fig 7b mm vs ll 3 high intensity land use management did not markedly hinder regional water sustainability overall with only one basin showing a statistically discernable increase in groundwater overdraft under these policies fig 6e f 4 4 2 influence of land use management on development patterns these trends were driven by changing spatial patterns of development in response to land use management without protecting prime farmland and groundwater recharge areas from urbanization ll development was most likely around city edges fig 9a adding urban sprawl limits ll mm reduced growth near cities surrounded by agriculture such as watsonville hollister santa maria and salinas as well as around smaller towns along the salinas valley to the south fig 9b development occurred instead in small rangeland towns and undeveloped groundwater basins particularly in parts of monterey county such as cholame valley fig 9b conserving areas prioritized by state habitat preservation goals mm lh had less impact on urbanization probability fig a 14 because urban areas were generally not near areas designated as priorities for preservation fig 2c rather it notably reduced agricultural growth in outlying rangeland areas lockwood valley cholame valley peach tree valley and carizzo plain moving it back into concentrated portions of current major agricultural areas such as the less overdrafted central salinas valley and around the city of paso robles fig 9c compare to fig 8 for baseline pattern of agricultural expansion in the santa maria valley protecting critical habitat for la graciosa thistle cirsium scariosum var loncholepis thorne et al 2019 concentrated development in the southwestern portion of the valley figures a 9 a 14 map the impact of land use management strategies on other land use transitions 5 discussion 5 1 management strategies for sustainable development our results suggest that demand management strategies under consideration by gsas could be widely effective at achieving aquifer sustainability based on current supply of water fig 6b these included programs designed to incentivize reduced withdrawals and fallow agricultural land in contrast solely enhancing supply performed little better than no interventions leaving most currently overdrafted basins in a state of overdraft fig 6a c similar results have been found for other semi arid regions of the world johannsen et al 2016 in california the water evaluation and planning system weap has been used to assess whether demand side interventions could achieve sustainability under land use change and climate change in the north coast mehta et al 2013 and central valley joyce et al 2006 2011 purkey et al 2008 this model simulated feedbacks between farmer s decision making on crop plantings and surface water availability and groundwater depth they found future water needs could be met only by combining both fallowing or shifting crops and increasing irrigation efficiency using drip irrigation however drip irrigation could reduce groundwater recharge mehta et al 2013 and is already utilized by vineyards the predominant driver of the agricultural growth projected for the central coast one issue is that water demand management strategies were also projected to cause leakage of agricultural development pressure lambin and meyfroidt 2011 to groundwater basins currently unregulated by sgma fig 8b this resulted in dramatic increases in water demand within these basins fig 7a which are relatively undeveloped potentially worsening local overdraft and degrading natural habitats these findings are corroborated by other recent studies liu et al 2017 priess et al 2011 at a global scale liu et al 2017 projected that cutting irrigation usage would cause leakage of cropland into other areas with sufficient water in semi arid mongolia priess et al 2011 found that constraining water use to availability would reduce crop yields and subsequently require a 10 increase in cultivated area their model site swim is the only other model that has included water and land use feedbacks between model water availability crop yields and subsequently farmer s fallowing decisions thus despite using completely different models these studies also predicted that demand side management can cause leakage of agricultural development importantly we found this leakage could be prevented by using land use planning to achieve major stakeholder goals the preservation of priority ecosystems recharge areas and prime farmland fig 9c moreover reducing rates of agricultural or urban development was not necessary to achieve sustainability fig 4a c rather it was theoretically feasible to achieve sustainability goals by strategic placement of cropland expansion and contraction within each county at the same rates they have occurred historically these results suggests that management strategies could work within existing socio economic forces driving changes in land use a combination of existing management options such as conservation easements implementation of laws protecting threatened species and zoning to cluster development could support such land use management similarly gao et al 2017 found that localized prohibitions on certain land uses in china could allow for agricultural expansion without significant new negative impacts alternatively liu et al 2017 simulated that inter basin water transfers could suppress leakage i e a supply side intervention our empirical model found water supply enhancement including water transfers which were used by some agencies see citations in table a 1 was much less effective at reducing leakage into undeveloped areas fig 8c than land use planning fig 9c imposing land use management did not significantly impede groundwater sustainability fig 6e f and intensive water management did not change overall projected rangeland loss fig 4d suggesting limited trade offs at a regional scale integrated water and land use management was thus projected to be a win win scenario for sustainable water agriculture and ecosystems figs 6 7 however 5 2 resilience theory and feedbacks in socio ecological systems theory supply side solutions are adaptive in nature because they alter existing state variables water supply but do not fundamentally change the linkages that control system behavior walker et al 2006 in california a recent disturbance the severe 2012 2016 drought led to a qualitative shift in the social system s controlling structures new sgma regulations but the water dependent development that accumulated during the unregulated historical exploitation period remains and continues to stress water supplies leahy 2016 while 33 of agencies planned management strategies to reduce or limit water demand supply side strategies were more common in gsps 50 of agencies table a 1 and citations therein these included water recycling and desalination plants conjunctive use programs removal of invasive species to reduce evapotranspiration and cloud seeding citations in table a 1 we argue supply side strategies risk treating water management as a steady state problem overdraft can be solved by adding additional water supplies until the new total inputs balance the unsustainable withdrawals they risk simply repeating a new cycle of exploitation of the enhanced resource fig 1 and were thus rarely sufficient for eliminating groundwater overdraft under future land use change fig 6b in contrast demand side strategies e g incentives to reduce development in overdrafted basins can be transformative because they alter the nature of the system by creating new cross scale linkages walker et al 2006 the new feedback between land use driven water demand and water supplies dramatically transformed patterns of future development fig 8 and fixed almost all overdraft fig 6 confirming our hypothesis that transformative demand side strategies would be more effective in producing long term water sustainability this supports a key tenet of socio ecological systems research that utilizing feedbacks and couplings to manage a system increases long term resilience kramer et al 2017 models exploring feedbacks between flooding and land use have likewise shown that development pathways that link these processes can greatly reduce eventual flood damages due to dynamic co evolution di baldassarre et al 2015 two previous models have simulated feedbacks between land use and water supplies joyce et al 2011 similarly showed that demand side management strategies more reliably achieved water sustainability in the face of climate uncertainty because feedbacks allowed water use to respond flexibly to the unpredictable future climate however groundwater dependent regions had reduced demand side feedbacks because increasing depth to groundwater was not an economically meaningful constraint on growers decision making in the absence of policy incentives joyce et al 2006 yalew et al 2018 also found that including such feedbacks only marginally improved model fit both previous approaches modeled feedbacks based on individual farmer s decision making rather than the broader scale of agency management we assessed the contrast in results between these studies and ours suggests that institutions may create stronger feedbacks than purely economic drivers 5 3 trends in land use and water use uncertainty in future projections is greater than the modeled range of projected land use changes i e fig 4 because uncertainty also arises from input parameters and data collection model design choices and assumptions and errors in model construction evans 2012 we have therefore focused on assessing system dynamics rather than predicting a precise future state huss 1988 but we here briefly discuss our historic and projected rates of land use change historic land use change showed an overall expansion of development but with declining annual cropland balancing the expansion of perennial cropland and developed areas these trends have been measured elsewhere in california anderson et al 2018 and other highly developed agricultural regions of the united states schilling et al 2008 our average projection of rangeland loss from 2021 to 2061 of 417 km2 fig 4c was greater than the 195 km2 projected by the earlier lucas version wilson et al 2020 this was due to the removal of an assumption that prevented perennial cropland from growing when annual cropland became locally scarce in the future which improved model performance appendix a 1 2 2 we projected 370 km2 of new domestic and industrial development from 2021 to 2061 fig 2c a 22 increase that was close to the state s 19 projected population increase 291 438 individuals over the same timeframe california dept of finance 2018 stakeholders reported that housing shortages are already an issue which the urban sprawl limits strategy to protect prime farmland could exacerbate by shifting urbanization away from major cities and into outlying rangeland towns fig 9 we estimated little change in total water use from current levels fig 4e which may have assisted the ability of demand caps to achieve sustainability the earlier version of lucas wilson et al 2020 predicted regional expansions of water demand exceeding 1 million afy however these models used different parameterization methods that we found overestimated perennial water demand and performed poorly in validation tests compared to the revised methods used in this paper appendix a 1 2 3 while the projected shift from annual to perennial cropland results in significant average year water savings fig 4e perennial crops cannot be easily fallowed and live for decades this could increase vulnerability by creating an inflexible water demand during drought anderson et al 2018 5 4 modeling approach and limitations land use models have generally not included social hydrological or climate feedbacks chen et al 2016 we used multiple local agencies groundwater modeling efforts to estimate a key parameter total sustainable supply which we could directly link to estimated historical water use rates and scale up to regional scale coupled projections of land use change and water sustainability this participatory approach enabled the incorporation of local knowledge about heterogeneous aquifers and management strategies into lucas w our focus on understanding feedbacks driven by governance structures aligns our work in the emerging field of socio hydrology di baldassarre et al 2015 pan et al 2018 and complements earlier feedback models that focused on farmer level decision making joyce et al 2006 priess et al 2011 a key caveat is that we could not quantitatively validate the accuracy of lucas w s projections under proposed management strategies including how realistically the model simulated the feedbacks introduced by water demand caps because these were hypothetical future policies that have not existed historically barlas 1996 leahy 2016 messina et al 2008 lucas w performed well at estimating water demand over the historic period with predicted values generally within 10 of values from independent datatsets fig a 2 for future projections and novel management scenarios barlas 1996 suggest examining whether long term patterns in graphs qualitatively match known or reasonable behavior as expected trajectories of future land use change under all five scenarios smoothly continued along historical trends without any dramatic shift in behavior fig 4a d or major deviations in water use fig 4e nevertheless lucas w s outputs should be viewed as resulting from the empirical input data under the specific assumptions of the model not a precise prediction of a future state in the coming decades empirical research comparing areas with and without demand caps under sgma could confirm whether lucas w s outcomes are accurate we assumed water use per km2 stays the same within each anthropogenic land use class precluding water demand changes due to shifts in cropland types due to changing global dietary preferences aleksandrowicz et al 2016 improvements in water use efficiency mehta et al 2013 or increasing evapotranspiration under climate change wada et al 2012 we found efficiency improvements were not a major strategy in most gsps and therefore assumed decreases in efficiency improvement and increases due to evaporative water demand under climate change would balance out nevertheless farmers could respond to gsp regulations by adopting more efficient irrigation or converting to less water intensive crops joyce et al 2011 purkey et al 2008 likewise our use of area based transition targets for new developed land use prevented the assessment of infill housing developments a major focus of current land use planning landis et al 2006 integrating infill development to assess housing needs will be a useful component of future development and future analyses could explore the sensitivity of our lucas w model to alternate trends in development and applied water needs complex interrelationships between climate land use and water use make projecting the future of such systems very difficult and our model makes key simplifications that limit its realism stonestrom et al 2009 land use alters the hydrologic cycle at fundamental levels altering evapotranspiration precipitation and temperatures runoff and recharge anderson et al 2018 calder et al 2003 feddema et al 2005 kueppers et al 2007 pielke et al 2007 spera et al 2016 these potential feedbacks were not included in our models our estimates of groundwater sustainability within specific basins are not substitutes for the detailed hydrological studies that water agencies conducted to create their management plans rather we view these approaches as complementary many hydrological models can ingest land use scenarios as inputs and then simulate more detailed aquifer and management dynamics johannsen et al 2016 öztürk et al 2013 tong et al 2012 these models are data intensive and challenging to parameterize at a regional scale but their outputs can feed into lucas w our regional model can in turn produce annual land use projections under a range of development trajectories and corresponding estimates of water sustainability that are uniquely informed by regional scale linkages coupling these approaches into a dynamic cross scale model would be a promising direction for future research 6 conclusions we showed that water demand caps could largely achieve sustainability with current water supplies whereas solely enhancing supply may not water demand management strategies caused leakage of agricultural land development pressure to groundwater basins currently unregulated by sgma dramatically increasing local water demand land use management strategies particularly prioritizing habitat conservation could prevent leakage into pristine areas these results suggest california s central coast has high adaptive capacity to cope with future changes via coordinated water and land use planning our assessment did not consider the vulnerabilities of different regions changes in water efficiency or housing density sensitivity of results to different possible land use futures grower decision making or feedbacks between land use and hydrological processes e g recharge ongoing research efforts include comprehensive vulnerability assessment including regional sensitivities and integrating housing density into projections future work could integrate lucas w with other hydrological models to assess a broader range of feedbacks by working with stakeholders to scale up local hydrological studies and management strategies into a regional scale land use model we were able to incorporate governance mediated feedbacks between land use and water availability parameterizing lucas w with actual management plans allowed us to more realistically assess the relative potential of land use and water management strategies to achieve water sustainability and prevent leakage which can inform implementation of sgma throughout california this approach is readily extensible to other regions where water supply and demand is
