7640,study region senegal river srb niger river nrb and lake chad basins lcb study focus we investigated the impacts of land use land cover change lulc and climate variability on the water balance components from 1990 to 2020 we applied the soil and water assessment tool swat coupled with remote sensing retrievals of actual evapotranspiration eta and surface soil moisture ssm to separate the impacts of the two aforementioned factors two numerical experiments were designed i climate variability effects by applying frozen lulc while changing the climate ii lulc change impacts by applying frozen climate while changing lulc new hydrological insights for the region overall at the basin level the results indicated that climate variability had the dominant role in increasing groundwater recharge surface runoff groundwater return flow and lateral flow in lcb and srb these increases triggered the recovery of lake area and higher water table in lcb and increased in srb streamflow while water scarcity increased in nrb in contrast the separate effect of lulc change specifically natural vegetation expansion increased actual et and decreased the surface runoff which could be a reason for lake area depletion in lcb and decreasing srb and nrb streamflow at the sub basin level lulc change i e a gain in cropland and urban areas at the expense of forests in some sub basins in nrb led to a local increase in surface runoff this implies a better redistribution of water in downstream and compensates the deficit in surface runoff caused by natural vegetation expansion in some other catchments these changes simultaneously with high intensity and long duration precipitation may increase the likelihood of inundation in some small catchments in the niger river basin these outcomes give useful hydrological insights into water and land management by emphasizing the crucial role of water recycling graphical abstract ga1 keywords african sahel swat model remote sensing etmonitor soil moisture lulc change climate variability data availability the data that has been used is available upon requrest 1 introduction understanding the response of a watershed to climate variability is complex because it is non linear due to the concurrent response of lulc to the same variability response modulated by anthropic interventions chen et al 2019 ewen and parkin 1995 chen and yu 2013 the non linearity is due to the modification of a watershed hydrological properties because of lulc changes this process is particularly relevant and complex under arid and semi arid conditions such as in the sahel where changes in water availability lead to large and rapid changes in lulc through the natural response of ecosystems to water and to the efforts of local communities to take advantage of water resources to improve land productivity for better food security a holistic comprehension of land surface dynamics its complexity and the interaction between its different parts are crucial to investigating the water balance components wbcs feyen and vázquez 2011 the effects of lulc change and climate variability on hydrological response could be different across regions chu et al 2010 therefore quantifying the impacts of lulc change and climate variability on the water balance of a river basin and its spatial pattern is essential for understanding catchment hydrology yin et al 2017 moreover a better understanding of the separate impacts of lulc and climate variability on water balance components is needed to develop effective land management policies towards sustainable water security the united nations articulated the sustainable development goals sdgs to identify shared priorities towards a better future for all scott and rajabifard 2017 vinuesa et al 2020 specifically sdg 6 addresses water security through a detailed hierarchy of tasks and targets which may be better achieved by combining land and water management these general concepts are even more relevant in africa where climate variability is a fundamental challenge especially in the sahel region which is considered one of the most vulnerable zones in the world the sahel is characterized by a variation in climate from arid in the north to humid in the south trémolières 2010 including hyper arid arid semi arid and dry sub humid zones moreover niger river lake chad and senegal river are large basins lake in the sahel which provide water resources for livelihood and shared by several countries this led to establish multiple organizations and communities to manage water resources trémolières 2010 which further enhances the relevance of these basins for a study of the response to climate variability and lulc changes the three basins are characterized by a large n s gradient in annual precipitation approximately ranging from 100 mm a 1 in the northern upper reaches to 1500 mm a 1 in the southern lower reaches the three aforementioned basins in the sahel experienced an important variability in precipitation since the 1970 s drought in the western part of the sahel region the senegal basin showed an increase in mean annual rainfall bodian et al 2020 stated that the average annual precipitation between 1940 and 2013 was about 500 mm while karambiri et al 2011 reported that the mean annual precipitation in 1990 was about 550 mm this increase in precipitation was confirmed by other studies anyamba and tucker 2005 olsson et al 2005 the niger river experienced a variability in rainfall especially after the 1970 s drought for instance descroix et al 2012 stated that the mean rainfall from 1905 to 2003 ranged between 300 mm and 570 mm while sighomnou et al 2013 reported that the mean rainfall during 1950 2013 was about 551 mm and many other studies reported a decrease in precipitation during recent years in the niger basin hulme 2001 okpara et al 2013 on the other hand the lake chad basin experienced an increase in precipitation as reported by nkiaka et al 2017 and okonkwo et al 2014 the mean annual rainfall in lake chad basin between 1951 and 2013 was about 465 mm mahmood and jia 2019 thus climate variability in the three watersheds was characterized by a different rainfall trend from west to east this variability in precipitation may have different impacts on hydrological responses in the three basins likewise lulc was rather different with cropland covering about 30 of the niger basin while being less than 10 in the senegal basin additionally natural vegetation was more expanded in senegal river and chad lake basins covering 80 while only 50 in the niger river basin some noticeable lulc transitions were detected by other studies in senegal basin for instance the gain of urban area and the cropland loss barnieh et al 2020 nwilo et al 2020 contrariwise an increase in cropland was stated in niger basin barnieh et al 2020 nwilo et al 2020 on the other hand the lake chad basin experienced water bodies loss and crop land increase at the expense of wetland barnieh et al 2020 accordingly we choose these three basins for detailed case studies several studies paid attention to investigating the effects of lulc change and climate variability on hydrological response in the sahel region for instance albergel 1987 investigated the impact of the 1970 s drought on surface runoff in two small catchments in the sahel 22 and 54 km2 his study reported that the surface runoff increased despite the precipitation decrease he attributed this increase to soil degradation caused by agriculture expansion this hypothesis was also reported by other studies mahe and olivry 1999 mahe 2006 studied the hydrological response to lulc changes in several small catchments in the sahel they reported that the expansion of cultivated area after deforestation since the 1970 s led to a decline in soil infiltration capacity and an increase in surface runoff leduc et al 2001 and leblanc et al 2008 have investigated the impacts of natural vegetation clearing on surface runoff and groundwater recharge in different small catchments in the sahel they reported that the natural vegetation clearing led to an increase in surface runoff with the being accumulated in ponds where it infiltrated to the aquifer mahe et al 2011 have investigated the hydrological response to climate and lulc change in different sub basins in the niger river basin during and after the 1970 s drought they stated that an increase in surface runoff has occurred despite the deficit in rainfall and they attributed this increase to deforestation this increase in surface runoff due to deforestation vegetation clearing and cultivated area expansion despite rainfall deficit was later defined as the first sahelian hydrological paradox descroix et al 2013 more recently rainfall and vegetation recovery was reported in several studies ali and lebel 2009 anyamba and tucker 2005 brandt et al 2017 descroix et al 2015 fensholt and rasmussen 2011 jiang et al 2022 after the precipitation recovery and the re greening of the sahel region many studies have been done to investigate the impacts of both lulc change and climate variability on hydrological response mahe et al 2003 investigated the evolution of surface runoff in several small catchments of right bank tributaries of the middle niger river and found that the surface runoff did not decrease despite the deficit in rainfall and they attributed this increase to cropland expansion amogu et al 2015 studied the impacts of cropped area on surface runoff in two small sahelian catchments in the niger river basin they found that the cropland changed soil characteristics which led to an increase in surface runoff in gourma in mali dardel et al 2014 have investigated the impact of vegetation recovery and climate variability on surface runoff from 1980 to 2012 they have used remote sensing data and ground observations furthermore nka et al 2015 have used hydrological ground observations to investigate the relationship between the increase in floods occurrence and climate variability in 11 small catchments area ranging between 1750 and 12 200 km2 in the sahel they found that the increase in the occurrence of floods in these 11 catchment was due to climate variability while no impact of lulc change was detected other studies have investigated the relationship between climate and lulc changes and hydrological response in the sahel descroix et al 2012 descroix et al 2009 and they attributed the increase in surface runoff to lulc change particularly crop land expansion while some other studies reported that it is difficult to determine whether the increase in surface runoff was due to lulc change or climate variability but it is a result of combined factors mahé and paturel 2009 the increase in runoff which has been occurring after vegetation recovery has recently been defined as the second sahelian paradox dardel et al 2014 almost of all previous studies have investigated the impacts of lulc change and climate variability on water balance in the entire region or in a huge area using statistical techniques based on a combination of remote sensing data ndvi and ground observations data precipitation and surface runoff these two types of data do provide the information necessary to separate the impacts of the two studied factors some other studies have applied hydrological models to separate the contribution of the two factors in changing hydrological response but in small catchments 1000 km2 furthermore most of the studies focused on surface runoff and streamflow while other water balance components are important but not well studied such as groundwater recharge and groundwater return flow moreover water recycling as a consequence of lulc change was not evaluated most studies compared the drought period 1970 s and 1980 s with the years past the drought till 2010 a study at basin level and sub basin level after the last recovery of vegetation and rainfall has not been done yet furthermore it is quite important to quantify the separate contributions of lulc change and climate variability in changing the water balance components based on the literature the sahel region is experiencing a rainfall recovery accompanied by re greening due to the expansion of cropland and natural vegetation which increased water consumption these changes in lulc present a huge environmental challenge for sahelian water resources so lulc change combined with climate variability raised serious threats for the hydrological response of this region which must be studied thus the objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate the separate impacts of climate variability and lulc on water balance components using a physically based hydrological model 2 to estimate the responses of different water balance components to climate variability and lulc changes at basin and sub basin scale and 3 to compare the relative contributions of these different factors and identify which one has the dominant impacts all abbreviations used in this study are defined in table a1 the novelty of this study is to separate and assess the impacts of lulc changes and climate variability on the water balance of large catchments particularly the quantification of groundwater recharge water recycling and the validity of the first and second hydrological paradox specifically in the nrb further we analyzed in depth the impacts of lulc change and climate variability on the water balance of sub catchments to identify the impacts of specific lulc changes e g cropped area in nrb on the water balance during post drought 1990 2000 near post drought 2001 2010 and far post drought 2010 2020 besides verifying the two aforementioned paradoxical behaviors was done at the sub basin level 2 study area and data 2 1 study area african sahel the sahel is characterized by four climatic zones hyper arid arid semi arid and dry sub humid several large hydrological basins are located in the sahel e g lake chad senegal and niger river basins this transition area attracted scientific attention due to the noticeable changes in climate and lulc during the last decades and their complex relationship with the hydrological response and water resources the first and second hydrological paradoxes were suggested in the sahel casenave and valentin 1992 descroix et al 2018 the lake chad basin which was the largest endorheic basin in the world experienced dramatic changes in terms of water area the lake changed from large 24 000 km2 to normal or intermediate 18 000 km2 and finally to a small lake fragmented into different separated water bodies as a permanent open water pool 1700 km2 and permanent or seasonal marshes from 2000 to 14 000 km2 lemoalle et al 2012 the largest basin in terms of catchment area in the sahel and the third longest river in africa is the niger which is characterized by the niger river inland delta and lakes district andersen et al 2012 the latter is a huge wetland in the basin and its tributaries along the middle niger left bank are sensitive to climate variability and lulc changes andersen et al 2012 descroix et al 2009 rameshwaran et al 2021 the senegal river basin experienced noticeable variations in hydrological responses due to intensive changes in lulc as well as climate variability specifically the precipitation faty et al 2019 oyebande and odunuga 2010 these three huge basins represent an important topic of studies addressing lulc changes climate variability and hydrological responses 2 1 1 basin level 2 1 1 1 senegal river basin srb the senegal river basin srb fig 1 is located in the western part of the sahel region with a total drainage area of approximately 375 000 km2 and a length of 1800 km the region is inhabited by 3 5 million people the basin is shared by four countries senegal guinea mali and mauritania the rainfall in srb varies from less than 200 mm to the north to about 2000 mm in the south and it is characterized by a rainy season from july to october the srb experienced a severe drought for about 30 years since 1970 almost all previous studies in the senegal basin focused on the variation of streamflow and surface runoff and led to conclude that rainfall is the main driver of surface runoff and streamflow variation on the other hand the quantification of groundwater recharge as well as surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater return flow and their contribution to water recycling within the watershed were less studied further the role of lulc changes and the effects on water balance components has not been deeply investigated senegal river basin experienced a conversion of crop land to other vegetation natural vegetation from 1975 to 2013 barnieh et al 2020 who also reported a gain in urban area likewise the transition from cropland to other vegetation was also detected in the senegal basin barnieh et al 2020 additionally water bodies loss was balanced by gains in other vegetation and wetland moreover an increase in urban area cropland and grassland between 2009 and 2018 was detected faye and du 2021 vittek et al 2014 have reported that from 1975 to 1990 other vegetation increased at the expanse of tree cover most probably due to agricultural expansion 2 1 1 2 niger river basin nrb the niger river fig 1 has a catchment area of 2 1 106 km2 and a length of 4200 km this region is inhabited by more than 100 million people and spans nine countries the rainfall in nrb varies from less than 200 mm in the north to about 2000 mm in the south and it is characterized by a rainy season from july to october a severe and extended drought has occurred in the watershed since 1970 almost all previous studies in the niger basin focused on the variation of streamflow and surface runoff they reported that during the aforementioned drought a first hydrological paradox was suggested in this basin i e the increase in surface runoff despite the decrease in rainfall descroix et al 2013 furthermore other studies reported that in the post drought period characterized by precipitation and vegetation recovery a second hydrological paradox appeared despite the increase in vegetation cover the surface runoff did not show any change the impacts of the vegetation and precipitation recovery were insufficiently investigated especially separating the impacts of these two factors on the other hand the hydrological responses to changes in lulc and climate variability particularly the validity of the hydrological paradoxes at the basin and sub basin level has not been thoroughly evaluated it can be considered a gap in hydrological knowledge in this important basin the niger basin experienced an increase in agricultural crops at the expense of other vegetation and forest as reported by barnieh et al 2020 vittek et al 2014 have reported that from 1975 to 1990 other vegetation increased at the expense of tree cover most probably due to agricultural expansion also obahoundje and diedhiou 2022 and descroix et al 2013 sta documented an expansion of agriculture in the niger basin and the loss of water bodies to cropland in the niger delta 2 1 1 3 lake chad basin lcb the lake chad basin lcb is the largest endorheic lake basin in the world and it is located in the center of the african sahel between 5 19 and 25 29 n latitude and 6 85 24 45 e longitude with an area of 2 5 106 km2 the region is inhabited by 17 4 million people according to delclaux et al 2008 the northern part of the basin is located in the sahara and it does not generate runoff so in this study we consider only the southern part fig 1 the southern part of lcb is covering an area of 1 106 km2 fig 1 and is shared by ten countries the open water area has experienced dramatic changes due to the severe drought since 1970 from large 24 000 km2 to normal or intermediate 18 000 km2 and finally to a small lake fragmented into different separated water bodies as a permanent open water pool 1700 km2 and permanent or seasonal marshes from 2000 to 14 000 km2 lemoalle et al 2012 the rainfall in the lcb varies from less than 100 mm in the north to about 1000 mm in the south and it is characterized by a rainy season from july to september almost all previous studies in the lake chad basin focused on investigating the variation of surface runoff during the drought and post drought periods evaluating at the same time the impacts of lulc changes and climate variability mainly on surface runoff mahmood and jia 2019 zhu et al 2019 furthermore some studies have assessed the impacts of climate change on the lake water balance and reported that groundwater is the main contributor to lake seepage pham duc et al 2020 the groundwater recharge and its role in the lake water balance were insufficiently taken into account and water recycling within the lcb particularly as a consequence of lulc changes was not studied the major lulc changes in lcb from 1975 to 2013 stated by barnieh et al 2020 were the transition of water bodies and wetland around the lake to cropland the loss of water bodies to other vegetation and an increase in urban area at the expense of other vegetation in 1975 1990 other vegetation increased at the expense of tree cover most probably due to agricultural expansion vittek et al 2014 an increase in cropland at the expense of other vegetation was reported by nwilo et al 2020 2 1 2 sub basin selection to illustrate the impact of lulc changes in the sahel we have selected several sub basins as hotspots in terms of lulc transitions at the basin level the major transition in the three watersheds was from bare land and forest to natural vegetation grass and shrub lands at the sub basin level and based on the lulc transition matrix in each sub basin we have considered only one example of each unique transition from one lulc class to another i e if we have 10 sub basins characterized by a transition from bare land to grassland we choose one example of these 10 etc accordingly the selected sub basins were from forest to cropland in sub basin 24 in niger river basin nrb sub24 from forest to urban and grassland in sub basin 23 in niger river basin nrb sub23 from bare land to grassland in sub basin 4 in senegal river basin srb sub 4 from grassland and cropland to water in sub basin 8 in lake chad basin lcb sub8 from forest and grassland to shrub land cropland and urban in sub basin 29 in lake chad basin lcb sub29 2 2 data this study used several datasets to drive the swat model listed in table 1 brief description of these data is given below readers may refer to the relevant references for more details this study covers the period of 1990 2020 the precipitation data were from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps the data was used at daily time steps from 1988 to 2020 atmospheric data including daily minimum and maximum temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation data were extracted from the fifth generation european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis data set ecmwf era5 hersbach et al 2020 this data were used at the daily time step the land use and land cover lulc dataset used in this study were produced by the tsinghua university based on landsat data at a spatial resolution of 30 m feng 2018 xu 2018 zhao 2021 and available for 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 we have used only three years 1990 2010 and 2020 to quantify the impacts of lulc changes on water balance the soil data set was obtained from the digital soil map of the world dsmw version 3 6 produced by the food and agriculture organization fao at a 1 km resolution the physical properties were extracted for each soil texture class from the swat database map window mw interface http swat tamu edu software mwswat the data set on soil properties is compiled from fao world soil data the digital elevation model dem of lcb was clipped out of the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 30 m resolution digital elevation data www earthexplorer usgs gov following our previous study bennour et al 2022 the etmonitor global et product hu and jia 2015 zheng et al 2022 jia et al 2018 was used to calibrate the swat model the validation of swat mode simulations was done using remote sensing retrievals of soil moisture generated by yao et al 2021 applying a neural network algorithm nnsm the nnsm dataset was downloaded from http data tpdc ac cn en data c26201fc 526c 465d bae7 5f02fa49d738 due to the different ways of calculating soil moisture i e swat which simulates surface soil moisture based on an empirical equation and different remote sensing algorithms such as random forest to generate surface soil moisture a systematic bias correction was applied using the mean standard deviation µ σ matching linear regression technique draper et al 2009 lopez et al 2017 rajib et al 2016 the correction was done based on the following equation 1 θ swat θ swat m swat σ rs σ swat m rs where θ swat and θ swat are corrected and original soil moisture respectively μrs and m swat are the mean of soil moisture from remote sensing and swat σ swat and σ rs are the standard deviation of swat and remote sensing soil moisture respectively 3 methodology generally the approach used in this study fig 2 is based on designing and carrying out simulation experiments to assess the individual and combined impacts of lulc change and climate variability on different water balance components of the three basins described in section 2 for the period of 1990 2020 the hydrological model swat was applied to estimate water balance components wbcs for the designed experimental scenarios changing lulc alone changing climate condition alone and the combined changes of these two factors the results of the numerical simulations were analyzed to identify the dominant drivers of the changes in water balance components in the study area in this work the study period was split into three periods i e the post drought period 1990 2000 the near post drought 2001 2010 and the far post drought period 2010 2020 based on precipitation evolution in the three watersheds the hydrological responses to lulc changes and climate variability were assessed during the near post drought 2001 2010 in this period the rainfall decreased in both niger river and lake chad basins while it increased in the senegal river basin compared to the post drought period 1990 2000 during the far post drought period 2010 2020 rainfall increased in both lake chad and senegal river basins while it decreased steadily in the niger river basin compared with the post drought period fig a1 these different rainfall trends might have had different impacts on the water balance of basins and sub basins before carrying out the numerical simulation experiments the swat model was calibrated using actual evapotranspiration et data derived from remote sensing product based on etmonitor model bennour et al 2022 for validation the soil moisture simulated by the calibrated swat model was evaluated by comparing with the remote sensing product of surface soil moisture fig 2 the following sections describe the different steps of the approach 3 1 swat model description 3 1 1 swat model set up the hydrological model swat used in this study is an open source and semi distributed model arnold et al 1998 the model is forced by data on meteorology topography soil properties and lulc and runs on a daily time step to simulate the water balance components in a watershed in this study the arcswat2012 version winchell et al 2013 was set up in the lake chad basin niger and senegal river basins based on a 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem then these three watersheds were disaggregated into sub basins which were further divided into hydrological response units hru s which are the smallest units in the watershed and that are comprised of unique lulc soil and slope combinations neitsch et al 2011 the swat model is not a fully distributed model and the disaggregation of the domain into sub basins and hru s is required to preserve the natural flow paths boundaries and channels required for routing water sediments and pollutants the disaggregation is done by applying a watershed discretization technique based on topographic features neitsch et al 2011 the number of sub basins is determined by the size of the watershed and the spatial resolution of the digital elevation model used for this purpose neitsch et al 2011 in this paper the watersheds were delineated and divided into 29 27 and 26 sub basins for lake chad basin niger and senegal river basins respectively the catchment water balance calculation in the swat model is based on the principle of mass conservation 2 sw t sw 0 i 1 n precip i surq i et a i gwrch i gwq i where t is the ending day of numerical simulation n is the duration of the numerical experiment i e total days of simulation the subscript i is the day number i 1 2 3 n sw t is the final soil water content for the entire soil profile mm of the whole simulation period sw 0 is the initial soil water content mm precip is the precipitation mm surq is the surface runoff mm et a i is the actual evapotranspiration mm gwrch is the groundwater recharge water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile mm and gwq is the groundwater return flow mm the simulation was done at daily step all variables in eq 2 are daily values 3 1 2 an indicator of water recycling the ratio of water outflow to water inflow it is interesting to introduce anthropic water diversions for different uses and inter basin water transfer which would modify the natural response of the basins however due to lack of information of where such interventions were applied it is impossible to introduce precisely such anthropic interventions on water flows the swat computes the contributions of each sub basin to streamflow i e wyld surq latq gwq then provides options to describe the use of streamflow in the river channels i e diversions for irrigation or other uses and allows inter sub basin water transfers neitsch et al 2011 we proposed to use the ratio of wyld prec as an indicator for potential water recycling i e the ratio of out in recycling r oir calculated as 3 r oir wyld prec where r oir is the ratio of out in recycling prec is the sum of precipitation over all sub basins km3 wyld km3 is the net amount of water that leaves the sub basin and contributes to streamflow in the reach and calculated as 4 wyld surq latq gwq q tloss where latq km3 is the lateral flow contribution to streamflow and q tl oss km3 is the transmission loss 3 1 3 swat model calibration and validation as in situ data were not available from the three basins the swat model calibration was conducted using actual evapotranspiration data derived from remote sensing observations following the calibration approach in our earlier work bennour et al 2022 instead of using run off data as usually done specifically the swat model was calibrated based on etmonitor actual et zheng et al 2022 for 2001 2010 at a monthly time step using swat cup abbaspour 2015 table 2 gave the results of the calibrated parameters the details about the parameter selection and calibration procedure can be found in bennour et al 2022 the validation was done by comparing the simulated soil moisture by the calibrated swat model with surface soil moisture derived from satellite remote sensing observations developed by yao et al 2021 called neural network soil moisture product nnsm see table 1 from 2013 to 2020 at a monthly time step model calibration and validation were evaluated by applying well documented metrics i e coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse kling gupta efficiency kge and percent bias pbias according to moriasi et al 2007 2015 all performance metrics used in this study are described in table 3 3 2 design of numerical simulations for assessing impacts of lulc changes and climate variability on water balance components 3 2 1 design of numerical simulations to investigate the dominant drivers influencing the water balance components in the three basins of the sahel we proposed an approach by carrying out the numerical simulations experiments based on scenarios that 1 the combined changes of these two factors 2 changing climate condition alone 3 changing lulc alone considering that the lulc data are available in 1990 2020 the study period 1990 2020 was split into three sub periods period 1 p1 was in 1990 2000 also taken as the baseline bl period i e p1 bl period 2 p2 was in 2001 2010 and period 3 p3 was in 2011 2020 forced by the daily meteorological and precipitation data and the corresponding lulc data the calibrated swat model was run at a daily step in 1990 2020 the years of 1988 and 1989 were used as a spin up period the daily outputs of the simulated water balance components i e surface runoff surq actual evapotranspiration eta soil water sw groundwater recharge gw rch groundwater return flow gwq and water yield wyld were then integrated to obtain the annual total values for each year which was further averaged over each period to get the 10 year mean of the water balance components of the corresponding period spatially the swat model was run in each hru then aggregated to obtain values of water balance components at the sub basin scale and finally the values at basin scale scenarios experiments were designed to identify the impact roles of lulc changes and climate variability these experiments were carried out by taking corresponding conditions of lulc and climate and described below 1 the combined impacts by lulc change and climate variability on wbcs numerical simulation was conducted by running the calibrated swat model forced by the daily meteorological and precipitation data from ear5 and chirps between 1990 and 2020 and the lulc data of 1990 2010 and 2020 were used to embody the lulc conditions for each one of the three periods p1 1990 2000 p2 2001 2010 p3 2011 2020 the simulated results of the mean values of annual water balance components in the baseline period p1 bl 1990 2000 were taken as the reference referred to as baseline values the mean values of annual water balance components in the other two periods p2 2001 2010 p3 2011 2020 were compared with the baseline values following the equation below 5 wbc pi wbc pi wbc bl where wbc pi is the change in a water balance component between the corresponding period pi p2 or p3 and the baseline period p1 wbc pi is the value of the water balance component in the corresponding period wbc bl is the value of the water balance component in the baseline period this experiment eq 5 gave the results of the combined impact of the actual conditions of lulc changes and climate variability in the two periods of 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 because the impacts were not distinguished 2 impacts of climate variability on wbcs to evaluate the impacts of the climate variability alone on the wbc we assumed no change in lulc condition for the entire period in 1990 2020 frozen as the condition in 1990 the swat model was run by taking lulc in 1990 and actual daily meteorological and precipitation data in 1990 2020 we divided the period of 2001 2020 into two climate scenarios 2001 2010 as climate scenario 1 cls1 2011 2020 as climate scenario 1 cls2 the impact of climate variability on a wbc in each climate scenario period was calculated as 6 wbc cli wbc clsi wbc bl where wbc cli is the change in a water balance component between the corresponding period cls1 or cls2 and the baseline period wbc clsi is the value of the water balance component for either cls1 or cls2 wbc bl is the value of a water balance component in the baseline period this experiment eq 6 gave the results of impact by climate variability only during the two periods of 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 3 impacts of lulc change on wbcs the quantification of impact of lulc change alone on the water balance components we assumed that daily meteorological and precipitation conditions in the period of 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 were the same as that in 1990 2000 frozen meteorological and precipitation conditions we divided the period of 2001 2020 into two lulc scenarios 2001 2010 as land use scenario 1 lus1 by using lulc data of 2010 and 2011 2020 as land use scenario 2 lus2 by using lulc data of 2020 the swat model was run for the entire period of 1990 2020 by taking the frozen meteorological and precipitation data in 1990 2000 and corresponding lulc data for the corresponding lulc data for each period the impact of lulc change on a wbc in each lulc scenario period was calculated as 7 wbc lui wbc lusi wbc bl where wbc lui is the change in a water balance component between the corresponding period lus1 or lus2 and the baseline period wbc lusi is the value of a water balance component for either lus1 or lus2 wbc bl is the value of a water balance component in the baseline period this experiment eq 7 gave the results of impact by lulc change only during the two periods of 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 3 2 2 impact score of lulc change and climate variability on wbcs the impacts of the changes in lulc and of climate variability on water balance components i e δsurq δeta δgw rch δsw δgwq and δwyld were estimated by eqs 6 7 for each lulc scenario lus1 and lus2 and each climate scenario cls1 and cls2 relative to the baseline to identify which factor dominated the

are the separate impact scores on water balance components i e actual et sw gw rch and surq caused by climate variability and caused by lulc change respectively wbc cli was calculated by eq 6 wbc lu

higher values of cr wbc cl or cr wbc lu indicate higher impact 4 results 4 1 results of swat calibration and validation in the three basins the calibration using monthly etmonitor retrievals of actual et indicated a good performance with values of r2 nse and kge greater than 0 7 and pbias values lower than 15 fig 3 the validation for the three basins using monthly nnsm soil moisture fig 4 showed that r2 nse and kge were higher than 0 7 and pbias lower than 15 moreover this high performance of swat calibration was confirmed by comparing actual et across the sub basins of the three basins fig

watersheds during 2001 2010 were evaluated using climate 2001 2010 and during 2011 2020 using climate 2011 2020 with frozen lulc at lulc1990 named cls1 and cls2 respectively these experiments were

lulc scenarios named lus1 and lus2 respectively senegal river basin the assessment of climate variability impacts on wbcswais done as described in section 3 2 1 2 i e based on the changes in wbcs during cls1 and cls2 compared to the baseline climate the precipitation precip increased during both cls1 and cls2 i e in the near and far post drought periods compared to post drought period which led to a rise in all wbcs fig 6d particularly during the far post drought period i e cls2 the rainfall increased by about 20 km3 which led to a rise in fresh water availability and expanding water recycling within the basin by increasing surface runoff groundwater return flow and lateral flow by 8 km3 3 km3 and 1 6 km3 respectively fig 6d table 4 moreover a rise in groundwater recharge by 3 km3 was estimated table 4 during the three periods the dominant lulc classes were shrub land grassland bare land cropland and forest respectively covering 30 50 10 7 and 2 of the watershed fig 7g water

cls1 and cls2 compared to the baseline climate and lulc the changes in lulc were a decrease in bare land forest and cropland area and an expansion of grassland and shrub land fig 7j the expansion of natural vegetation in the three watersheds led to an increase in actual et and a decline in freshwater availability due to the decrease in surq gwq and latq fig 7d table4 niger river basin the assessment of climate variability impact on wbcs was done as described in section 3 2 1 2 based on the changes in wbcs during cls1 and cls2 compared to baseline the precipitation during cls1 and cls2 near and far post drought periods compared to bl decreased with a resulting decrease in all water balance components fig 6e the continuation of the severe drought i e the decrease in precipitation

2 1 3 based on the changes in wbcs during lus1 and lus2 compared to the baseline scenario the changes in lulc were characterized by a decrease in bare land and forest area and an expansion of grassland shrub land and cropland fig 7k the expansion of natural vegetation in the three watersheds led to an increase in actual et and a decline in freshwater availability by decreasing surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater return flow fig 7e table 4 lake chad basin the assessment of climate variability impact on wbcs was done as described in section 3 2 1 2 based on the changes in wbcs during cls1 and cls2 compared with the baseline climate during the near post drought period a decrease in rainfall was estimated which led to a decline in all water balance components compared to the post drought period bl during the far post drought period the precipitation increase triggered a rise in all water balance components particularly surface runoff lateral flow and return flow fig 6f i e an increase in freshwater availability and water recycling the dominant lulc classes were shrub land grassland bare land cropland and forest respectively covering 45 40 3 10 and 2 of the

changes in wbcs during lus1 and lus2 compared with the baseline climate and lulc the changes in lulc were characterized by a decrease in bare land and forest area and an expansion of grassland shrub land and cropland fig 7l the expansion of natural vegetation in the three watersheds led to an increase in actual et with a decline in freshwater availability and potential water recycling by decreasing surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater return flow fig 7l table 4 4 2 2 2 water recycling assessment the results on the water ratio in out recycling r oir index indicated that this index had a value of 0 2 0 07 and 0 2 in srb lcb and nrb respectively table 5 which means that water yields from the watershed were about 20 7 and 20 of the precipitation in srb lcb and nrb respectively hence an amount of water s transferred from sub basins upstream to the next sub basin downstream within the watershed which we call water recycling thus water recycling provides an additional volume of water which could be diverted for irrigation or to another reservoir from upstream to downstream we did not explore it further for the reasons explained earlier set 3 4 4 2 2 3 impact assessment by sub basins after we selected the hotspots in terms of lulc change we analyzed the combined impacts of lulc change and climate variability on actual evapotranspiration surface runoff soil water groundwater recharge groundwater return flow and water yield in response to these transitions the average annual changes of water balance components in response to the change in lulc area between lulc1990 and lulc2020 and between climate 1990 2000 and 2011 2020 are shown in fig 8 the greatest positive change of actual evapotranspiration caused by the combined impact of lulc change and climate variability 4 7 km3 was in sub basin 8 of the lake chad basin fig 8 d1 as regards the analysis of the separate impacts of lulc change and climate variability the increase in eta was mainly caused by climate variability 3 8 km3 specifically the increase in precipitation fig 8 d2 rather than the increase in natural vegetation fig 8 d3 the most significant decline in surface runoff groundwater recharge and groundwater return flow caused by the combined impact of climate variability and lulc change appeared in sub basin 23 of niger river basin fig 8 b1 after investigating the separate impacts of lulc change and climate variability we found that this decrease of three variables was mainly due to climate variability fig 8 b2 rather than lulc change fig 8 b3 the sub basin 24 in nrb showed an increase in surface runoff fig 8 c3 despite the rainfall deficit due to the increase in cropland at the expense of forest fig 8 c2 and c4 the highest increase in surface runoff groundwater recharge and groundwater return flow caused by climate variability and lulc change was in sub basin 29 of lake chad basin fig 8 e1 after examining the separate impacts of the two drivers we figured out that this increment in surface runoff groundwater recharge and groundwater return flow was triggered by climate variability fig 8 e2 4 2 3 the contribution of specific lulc types to the impact of lulc change overall the results fig 9 indicated that the re greening of the study area caused by the increase of grassland and shrub land at the expense of bare land and forest loss led to an increase in actual et which triggered a decrease in surq in the senegal river fig 9 a1 and a2 and niger river basins fig 9 b1 and b2 both lus1 and lus2 are characterized by an important gain of grassland and shrub land at the expense of bare land this gain triggered a rise in actual et and a decrease in surq accompanied by an increase in gw rch and sw fig 9 a3 and a4 the niger river basin showed a gain in cropland which led to reduce the decline of surq the increase in shrub land area led to a rise in gw rch and sw but it was smaller than the decline caused by forest loss on the contrary a noticeable gain in the grassland area was detected but the grassland actual et increased slightly fig 9 b3 and b4 in the lake chad basin fig 9 c1 and c2 an expansion in shrub land and cropland areas at the expense of bare land was identified causing an increase in actual et and a decline in surq at the same time the reduction in forest triggered a decrease in gw rch and sw fig 9 c3 and c4 a meager increase in grassland about 100 km2 was estimated while the actual et decreased due to the shifting of grassland from the humid to arid part of the watershed barnieh et al 2022 human contribution plays an important role in the evolution of sahel region s hydrological response the water balance variation however was mostly impacted by the re greening of the sahel through the expansion of shrub land and grassland at the expense of bare land and forest the man made lulc changes had a crucial contribution to the increase of actual et and surq mainly by the expansion of cropland in the niger river and lake chad basins furthermore we have calculated the percentage contribution of the water yield by each major lulc type to the total wyld of all major lulc classes then we investigated the change in the percentage contribution from 1990 to 2020 to identify the lulc types which highly reduced water yield table 6 in srb the wyld decreases was related to the loss in bare land and crop land the decrease in forest had a positive impact on wyld in nrb the increase in shrub land and grassland at the expense of bare land led to a decrease in wyld furthermore the increase in crop land had a negative impact on wyld contrariwise forest loss had a positive impact on wyld in lcb mainly the conversion of bare land to shrub land and grassland had a major impact on wyld decline 4 2 4 impacts of lulc changes vs climate variability the impact scores cr of the lulc change cr lu and climate variability cr cl on each water balance component i e eta surq gw rch and sw were calculated for p2 2001 2010 and p3 2011 2020 according to the procedure described in section 3 2 2 eqs 8 and 9 and given in table 7 an absolute value of cr lu of a variable close or higher than 1 means that variable is impacted by a lulc change if the absolute value of cr cl of the variable is close or higher than 1 it means the variable is impacted by climate variability in the senegal river basin during p2 climate variability was the dominant driver in increasing the actual et with cr cl 0 85 and decreasing sw cr cl 1 15 at the same time the lulc change was the main driver of increasing gw rch with cr cl about 0 57 the combined lulc change and climate variability decreased surq mainly due to the impact of lulc changes which led to its decrease with cr lu about 2 3 in contrast climate variability contributed to the increase in surq with cr cl 1 5 i e lower and opposite sign than the impact of lulc change during p3 climate variability was the dominant driver of the rises in eta sw gw rch and surq with cr cl values of 0 79 0 96 0 87 and 1 45 respectively scores of cr lu are much smaller in the niger river basin the eta gw rch and sw were highly impacted by climate variability with cr cl equal to 1 32 0 95 and 1 01 respectively during p2 and 1 43 1 02 and 0 82 respectively during p3 in both periods the surq which was decreasing during both p2 and p3 was impacted mainly by the lulc changes with cr lu values equal to 1 01 and 0 82 respectively in lake chad basin the actual et sw and gw rch were highly affected by climate variability with cr cl equal to 1 05 0 99 and 0 94 respectively during p2 and 0 83 0 97 and 0 98 respectively during p3 the surq was decreasing during p2 and it was mainly influenced by lulc changes with cr lu equal to 1 78 while during p3 surq was increasing and it was influenced by climate variability with cr cl equal to 1 15 5 discussion 5 1 calibration and validation performance according to moriasi et al 2007 2015 and kouchi et al 2017 the pbias values indicate the goodness of the model performance in our study the calibration of the swat model in the three watersheds using remote sensing actual et from etmonitor etmonitor eta at monthly time steps gave pbias values 15 the pbias values in this study were lower than those found in the study by odusanya et al 2019 in the ogun river basin in nigeria using actual et from mod16 mod16 eta and gleam gleam eta the outcomes of our study were also confirmed by poméon et al 2018 when they used mod16 for swat model validation in west africa furthermore our results agreed with lopez et al 2017 findings in morocco the validation results in our work were also confirmed by poméon et al 2018 and odusanya et al 2019 when they calibrated and validated the swat model using remote sensing soil moisture they reported that the dynamic of the swat sm fit very well with the remote sensing sm retrievals esa cci ssm in the upper few centimeters of the soil profile in most of the basin at a monthly time step 5 2 comparison with previous studies we compared our results with previous studies table a5 the huge difference between the results of the first two studies by sane et al 2020 in the upper reach of the senegal river basin srb is due to the difference in study areas and periods the three other studies simulated the surface runoff surq in different sub catchments of srb during recent periods the results of the two studies carried out by faty et al 2019 and sun et al 2013 showed comparable surface runoff values with our study furthermore the above mentioned three studies were carried out in small catchments in srb while in our study the surq was estimated for the whole srb the first two studies numbers 9 and 10 in table a5 in the niger river basin nrb showed surq values lower than that in our study andersen et al 2012 descroix et al 2009 these two studies were carried out in two small catchments in the nrb while our study was done for the whole nrb therefore it might be concluded that these difference in the simulated surq between our study and other studies in smaller areas was partly due to the difference in spatial coverage moreover the study by mamadou et al 2015 in the small koris basin in nrb showed comparable results to ours likewise in the lake chad basin lcb almost all studies in previous work were done in the chari logone basin whereas our study was carried out for the entire southern lcb studies numbered 16 19 in table a5 descroix et al 2009 lemoalle et al 2012 mahamat nour et al 2021 zhu et al 2017 showed comparable results to our study furthermore the majority of the studies in the three watersheds have different spatial and temporal coverage which leads to some differences compared to our findings however the surface runoff simulated in our study is comparable to recent studies in different catchments 5 3 assessment of combined and separate impacts of lulc changes and climate variability in srb the decrease in surq during period 2 p2 2001 2010 compared to the baseline p1 bl 1990 2000 due to the dominant impact of natural vegetation expansion in decreasing surq this outcome agrees with the findings of diop et al 2017 who reported a decrease in the upper reach of srb while the increase in surq during and period 3 p3 2011 2020 compared to the baseline p1 bl 1990 2000 is explained by the dominant impacts of climate variability in increasing surq this finding is confirmed by wilcox et al 2018 the increase in groundwater recharge gw rch was also detected by other studies which did not provide estimates of groundwater recharge which led to a rise in return flow hollis 1990 in lcb the decrease in surq during p2 compared to the baseline can be explained by the combined impacts of lulc changes and climate variability as also confirmed by mahmood and jia 2019 on the other hand surq increased during p3 compared with the baseline similar results was reported by pham duc et al 2020 the latter study also underscored the contribution of groundwater to the recovery of the open water area of the lcb still they did not mention or quantify the role of water recycling in the nrb the estimated decrease in surq and gw rch during both p2 and p3 does not agree with the findings of boulain et al 2009 and favreau et al 2009 i e that both surq and gw rch increased despite a rainfall deficit in two small catchments in nrb during the post drought period in the srb the rise in surq gw rch and return flow gwq during both cls1 2001 2010 and cls2 2011 2020 compared to baseline 1990 2000 was caused by the increase in rainfall these findings of our study agree with oyebande and odunuga 2010 on the other hand in the nrb the decline in surq gw rch and gwq caused by the deficit in rainfall during both cls1 and cls2 does not agree with the findings of descroix et al 2013 although they documented the decrease in actual et due to the decline of rainfall however in some small catchments in the nrb descroix et al 2018 reported a reduction of surq due to the rainfall deficit in lcb the decline in surq during cls1 was clearly caused by rainfall deficit as also confirmed by mahmood and jia 2019 furthermore our outcomes of increase in gw rch gwq and surq during cls2 agreed with the study by pham duc et al 2020 the decline in surq was due to the increase in actual et triggered by the gain in natural vegetation vegetation recovery at the expense of bare land and forest loss during both lus1 lulc2010 and lus2 lulc2020 compared to baseline lulc1990 this evidence emerged in the three watersheds similar result was also reported by faty et al 2019 particularly in the upper reach of srb this decrease in surq was also noted by mahmood and jia 2019 in the lcb however boulain et al 2009 and favreau et al 2009 reported an increase in surq and gw rch in the nrb which disagrees with our findings our findings on a decrease in surq due to lulc change in nrb agreed with daramola et al 2022 the decrease in surq was more noticeable in srb compared to nrb and lcb this is probably due to the loss of cropland in srb while the crop area increased in nrb and lcb these results suggest that an increase in cropland may trigger an increase in surq as also found by several studies guzha et al 2018 lørup et al 1998 mao and cherkauer 2009 op de hipt et al 2019 also in agreement with aich et al 2015 and descroix et al 2009 according to giertz et al 2005 this increase in surface runoff caused by cropland expansion could be explained by the decrease of macroporosity caused by the reduction of biological activity as a result of the disturbance of the soil by agricultural activities the surface runoff increase is also probably due to the decrease in interception caused by land clearing and tree removal which leads to a decrease in canopy interception further studies could be carried out by using satellite observation based data product e g zheng and jia 2020 among others to analyzing the impact of lulc change on the in canopy rainfall interception thereafter on wbcs in addition the conversion from forest to cropland after land clearance reduces direct evaporation which increases surface runoff leblanc et al 2008 mounirou et al 2020 the results of this study on the decrease in surface runoff due to natural vegetation expansion disagreed with trichon et al 2018 and descroix et al 2018 who reported that the re greening of the sahel did not reduce the surq at the same time this gain in cropland was accompanied by a spread of natural vegetation at the expense of bare land loss which led to an increase in actual et in the same catchment ogutu et al 2021 the water yield decreased in response to such lulc change specifically the decline in surq was larger than the increase in gwq and latq in srb on the other hand the decrease in surq led to a decline in water yield in lcb the decline in potential water recycling as consequence of lulc change was mainly due to the vegetation recovery at the expense of bare land loss the expansion of cropland in the niger river basin had also a negative impact on water yield while the deforestation had a positive impact on water yield in the three watersheds the re greening of the region by expansion of grassland and shrub land led to an increase in actual et and to a decrease in surq as confirmed by yonaba et al 2021 and ogutu et al 2021 this vegetation recovery played a major role in increasing gw rch and soil water content sw and these results agreed with marshall et al 2012 this finding applied to three watersheds but the change was larger in nrb and lcb than that in srb and in agreement with mahmood and jia 2019 both climate variability and lulc change had nearly similar impacts on the hydrological response in the srb the lcb was more sensitive to the lulc change during p2 this process significantly reduced water availability by decreasing the surq and increasing the water loss via evapotranspiration because of the higher actual et in contrast climate variability was the main driver of increasing surq during p3 as also reported by pham duc et al 2020 the nrb was essentially impacted by climate variability our study did not mean to say that our approach in general and independently from site specific knowledge might be directly used by water managers rather that it could be applied to understand better the hydrology in large and complex basins even more specifically our study shows how lulc affects hydrological processes across a range of scales and basins with different hydrological characteristics and climate variabilities and therefore how land management could aim at modifying water flows 6 conclusions the assessment of the combined impacts of changes in lulc change and climate variability revealed that during the near post drought period 2001 2010 the water balance components both the absolute magnitude of water balance components and their relative fractions in the three watersheds were rather different than that in the post drought period 1990 2000 also as baseline period in the far post drought period 2011 2020 our findings indicated an increase in water balance components compared to the post drought period in senegal river and lake chad basins and a decrease in the niger river basin these changes triggered a shortage of freshwater availability and showed that the first sahelian hydrological paradox see introduction i e a rise in surface water runoff despite the decline of precipitation did not apply to niger river basin furthermore our findings indicated that the second hydrological paradox see introduction i e a continuous increase in surface runoff despite the re greening of the sahel did not apply to our study period and regions during the far post drought period an increase in rainfall was estimated in both the srb and the lcb leading to a rise in freshwater availability and water recycling because of the increase in water yield in the nrb the shortage of water supply continued resulting in the continuation of the drought in the basin which showed that the sahelian hydrological paradoxes described in the introduction did not apply at basin level these findings confirmed the rejection of the hypothesis paradox that is sahel re greening did not decrease surface runoff in lcb and srb the increase in water yield caused by climate variability played an important role in improving water availability in the basin furthermore the man made extension of cropland at the expense of the forest loss had an important role in mitigating the decrease in surface runoff moreover the continuous population growth led to an increase in the cultivated area at the expense of forest loss i e a further increase in surface runoff the latter may contribute to water recycling through water transfer from a sub basin upstream to the next sub basin downstream these findings emphasized the crucial role of water recycling within the watershed as well as gave a good hydrological insight into the interrelation of water and land management in the study area the lulc change was the major responsible driver for the decrease in surface runoff and water yield especially in the nrb during both the near post drought cr lu 1 and far post drought cr lu 0 85 periods and in the lcb during the far post drought cr lu 1 8 period thus investigating the relationship between hydrologic response and lulc change in river basins at various spatial scales can help identify vulnerable sub basins due to lulc changes this could help prioritize effective land management practices to preserve sustainable water management as a summary of this study in recent years far post drought period the combined impact of lulc change and climate variability indicated an increase in most of water balance components in lcb and srb while it shows a decrease in most of water balance components was estimated in nrb while seperate impact of lulc change indicated an increase in actual et resulted in the decreases in surface runoff groundwater recharge and groundwater return flow in srb nrb and lcb these changes were triggered by the expansion of natural vegetation in the sahel watersheds and implied a steady reduction in water availability as well as a limited water recycling in the basin caused by lulc change the separate impact of climate variability showed that the reduction of precipitation in the nrb augmented the water scarcity and this could be an alert of desertification in the basin in the srb and lcb the increase in precipitation led to an increase in surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater return flow the latter increased potential water recycling and freshwater availability as a consequence of climate variability this increase in precipitation led to a rise in groundwater recharge as well funding this work was jointly funded by the project supported by the key

7640,study region senegal river srb niger river nrb and lake chad basins lcb study focus we investigated the impacts of land use land cover change lulc and climate variability on the water balance components from 1990 to 2020 we applied the soil and water assessment tool swat coupled with remote sensing retrievals of actual evapotranspiration eta and surface soil moisture ssm to separate the impacts of the two aforementioned factors two numerical experiments were designed i climate variability effects by applying frozen lulc while changing the climate ii lulc change impacts by applying frozen climate while changing lulc new hydrological insights for the region overall at the basin level the results indicated that climate variability had the dominant role in increasing groundwater recharge surface runoff groundwater return flow and lateral flow in lcb and srb these increases triggered the recovery of lake area and higher water table in lcb and increased in srb streamflow while water scarcity increased in nrb in contrast the separate effect of lulc change specifically natural vegetation expansion increased actual et and decreased the surface runoff which could be a reason for lake area depletion in lcb and decreasing srb and nrb streamflow at the sub basin level lulc change i e a gain in cropland and urban areas at the expense of forests in some sub basins in nrb led to a local increase in surface runoff this implies a better redistribution of water in downstream and compensates the deficit in surface runoff caused by natural vegetation expansion in some other catchments these changes simultaneously with high intensity and long duration precipitation may increase the likelihood of inundation in some small catchments in the niger river basin these outcomes give useful hydrological insights into water and land management by emphasizing the crucial role of water recycling graphical abstract ga1 keywords african sahel swat model remote sensing etmonitor soil moisture lulc change climate variability data availability the data that has been used is available upon requrest 1 introduction understanding the response of a watershed to climate variability is complex because it is non linear due to the concurrent response of lulc to the same variability response modulated by anthropic interventions chen et al 2019 ewen and parkin 1995 chen and yu 2013 the non linearity is due to the modification of a watershed hydrological properties because of lulc changes this process is particularly relevant and complex under arid and semi arid conditions such as in the sahel where changes in water availability lead to large and rapid changes in lulc through the natural response of ecosystems to water and to the efforts of local communities to take advantage of water resources to improve land productivity for better food security a holistic comprehension of land surface dynamics its complexity and the interaction between its different parts are crucial to investigating the water balance components wbcs feyen and vázquez 2011 the effects of lulc change and climate variability on hydrological response could be different across regions chu et al 2010 therefore quantifying the impacts of lulc change and climate variability on the water balance of a river basin and its spatial pattern is essential for understanding catchment hydrology yin et al 2017 moreover a better understanding of the separate impacts of lulc and climate variability on water balance components is needed to develop effective land management policies towards sustainable water security the united nations articulated the sustainable development goals sdgs to identify shared priorities towards a better future for all scott and rajabifard 2017 vinuesa et al 2020 specifically sdg 6 addresses water security through a detailed hierarchy of tasks and targets which may be better achieved by combining land and water management these general concepts are even more relevant in africa where climate variability is a fundamental challenge especially in the sahel region which is considered one of the most vulnerable zones in the world the sahel is characterized by a variation in climate from arid in the north to humid in the south trémolières 2010 including hyper arid arid semi arid and dry sub humid zones moreover niger river lake chad and senegal river are large basins lake in the sahel which provide water resources for livelihood and shared by several countries this led to establish multiple organizations and communities to manage water resources trémolières 2010 which further enhances the relevance of these basins for a study of the response to climate variability and lulc changes the three basins are characterized by a large n s gradient in annual precipitation approximately ranging from 100 mm a 1 in the northern upper reaches to 1500 mm a 1 in the southern lower reaches the three aforementioned basins in the sahel experienced an important variability in precipitation since the 1970 s drought in the western part of the sahel region the senegal basin showed an increase in mean annual rainfall bodian et al 2020 stated that the average annual precipitation between 1940 and 2013 was about 500 mm while karambiri et al 2011 reported that the mean annual precipitation in 1990 was about 550 mm this increase in precipitation was confirmed by other studies anyamba and tucker 2005 olsson et al 2005 the niger river experienced a variability in rainfall especially after the 1970 s drought for instance descroix et al 2012 stated that the mean rainfall from 1905 to 2003 ranged between 300 mm and 570 mm while sighomnou et al 2013 reported that the mean rainfall during 1950 2013 was about 551 mm and many other studies reported a decrease in precipitation during recent years in the niger basin hulme 2001 okpara et al 2013 on the other hand the lake chad basin experienced an increase in precipitation as reported by nkiaka et al 2017 and okonkwo et al 2014 the mean annual rainfall in lake chad basin between 1951 and 2013 was about 465 mm mahmood and jia 2019 thus climate variability in the three watersheds was characterized by a different rainfall trend from west to east this variability in precipitation may have different impacts on hydrological responses in the three basins likewise lulc was rather different with cropland covering about 30 of the niger basin while being less than 10 in the senegal basin additionally natural vegetation was more expanded in senegal river and chad lake basins covering 80 while only 50 in the niger river basin some noticeable lulc transitions were detected by other studies in senegal basin for instance the gain of urban area and the cropland loss barnieh et al 2020 nwilo et al 2020 contrariwise an increase in cropland was stated in niger basin barnieh et al 2020 nwilo et al 2020 on the other hand the lake chad basin experienced water bodies loss and crop land increase at the expense of wetland barnieh et al 2020 accordingly we choose these three basins for detailed case studies several studies paid attention to investigating the effects of lulc change and climate variability on hydrological response in the sahel region for instance albergel 1987 investigated the impact of the 1970 s drought on surface runoff in two small catchments in the sahel 22 and 54 km2 his study reported that the surface runoff increased despite the precipitation decrease he attributed this increase to soil degradation caused by agriculture expansion this hypothesis was also reported by other studies mahe and olivry 1999 mahe 2006 studied the hydrological response to lulc changes in several small catchments in the sahel they reported that the expansion of cultivated area after deforestation since the 1970 s led to a decline in soil infiltration capacity and an increase in surface runoff leduc et al 2001 and leblanc et al 2008 have investigated the impacts of natural vegetation clearing on surface runoff and groundwater recharge in different small catchments in the sahel they reported that the natural vegetation clearing led to an increase in surface runoff with the being accumulated in ponds where it infiltrated to the aquifer mahe et al 2011 have investigated the hydrological response to climate and lulc change in different sub basins in the niger river basin during and after the 1970 s drought they stated that an increase in surface runoff has occurred despite the deficit in rainfall and they attributed this increase to deforestation this increase in surface runoff due to deforestation vegetation clearing and cultivated area expansion despite rainfall deficit was later defined as the first sahelian hydrological paradox descroix et al 2013 more recently rainfall and vegetation recovery was reported in several studies ali and lebel 2009 anyamba and tucker 2005 brandt et al 2017 descroix et al 2015 fensholt and rasmussen 2011 jiang et al 2022 after the precipitation recovery and the re greening of the sahel region many studies have been done to investigate the impacts of both lulc change and climate variability on hydrological response mahe et al 2003 investigated the evolution of surface runoff in several small catchments of right bank tributaries of the middle niger river and found that the surface runoff did not decrease despite the deficit in rainfall and they attributed this increase to cropland expansion amogu et al 2015 studied the impacts of cropped area on surface runoff in two small sahelian catchments in the niger river basin they found that the cropland changed soil characteristics which led to an increase in surface runoff in gourma in mali dardel et al 2014 have investigated the impact of vegetation recovery and climate variability on surface runoff from 1980 to 2012 they have used remote sensing data and ground observations furthermore nka et al 2015 have used hydrological ground observations to investigate the relationship between the increase in floods occurrence and climate variability in 11 small catchments area ranging between 1750 and 12 200 km2 in the sahel they found that the increase in the occurrence of floods in these 11 catchment was due to climate variability while no impact of lulc change was detected other studies have investigated the relationship between climate and lulc changes and hydrological response in the sahel descroix et al 2012 descroix et al 2009 and they attributed the increase in surface runoff to lulc change particularly crop land expansion while some other studies reported that it is difficult to determine whether the increase in surface runoff was due to lulc change or climate variability but it is a result of combined factors mahé and paturel 2009 the increase in runoff which has been occurring after vegetation recovery has recently been defined as the second sahelian paradox dardel et al 2014 almost of all previous studies have investigated the impacts of lulc change and climate variability on water balance in the entire region or in a huge area using statistical techniques based on a combination of remote sensing data ndvi and ground observations data precipitation and surface runoff these two types of data do provide the information necessary to separate the impacts of the two studied factors some other studies have applied hydrological models to separate the contribution of the two factors in changing hydrological response but in small catchments 1000 km2 furthermore most of the studies focused on surface runoff and streamflow while other water balance components are important but not well studied such as groundwater recharge and groundwater return flow moreover water recycling as a consequence of lulc change was not evaluated most studies compared the drought period 1970 s and 1980 s with the years past the drought till 2010 a study at basin level and sub basin level after the last recovery of vegetation and rainfall has not been done yet furthermore it is quite important to quantify the separate contributions of lulc change and climate variability in changing the water balance components based on the literature the sahel region is experiencing a rainfall recovery accompanied by re greening due to the expansion of cropland and natural vegetation which increased water consumption these changes in lulc present a huge environmental challenge for sahelian water resources so lulc change combined with climate variability raised serious threats for the hydrological response of this region which must be studied thus the objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate the separate impacts of climate variability and lulc on water balance components using a physically based hydrological model 2 to estimate the responses of different water balance components to climate variability and lulc changes at basin and sub basin scale and 3 to compare the relative contributions of these different factors and identify which one has the dominant impacts all abbreviations used in this study are defined in table a1 the novelty of this study is to separate and assess the impacts of lulc changes and climate variability on the water balance of large catchments particularly the quantification of groundwater recharge water recycling and the validity of the first and second hydrological paradox specifically in the nrb further we analyzed in depth the impacts of lulc change and climate variability on the water balance of sub catchments to identify the impacts of specific lulc changes e g cropped area in nrb on the water balance during post drought 1990 2000 near post drought 2001 2010 and far post drought 2010 2020 besides verifying the two aforementioned paradoxical behaviors was done at the sub basin level 2 study area and data 2 1 study area african sahel the sahel is characterized by four climatic zones hyper arid arid semi arid and dry sub humid several large hydrological basins are located in the sahel e g lake chad senegal and niger river basins this transition area attracted scientific attention due to the noticeable changes in climate and lulc during the last decades and their complex relationship with the hydrological response and water resources the first and second hydrological paradoxes were suggested in the sahel casenave and valentin 1992 descroix et al 2018 the lake chad basin which was the largest endorheic basin in the world experienced dramatic changes in terms of water area the lake changed from large 24 000 km2 to normal or intermediate 18 000 km2 and finally to a small lake fragmented into different separated water bodies as a permanent open water pool 1700 km2 and permanent or seasonal marshes from 2000 to 14 000 km2 lemoalle et al 2012 the largest basin in terms of catchment area in the sahel and the third longest river in africa is the niger which is characterized by the niger river inland delta and lakes district andersen et al 2012 the latter is a huge wetland in the basin and its tributaries along the middle niger left bank are sensitive to climate variability and lulc changes andersen et al 2012 descroix et al 2009 rameshwaran et al 2021 the senegal river basin experienced noticeable variations in hydrological responses due to intensive changes in lulc as well as climate variability specifically the precipitation faty et al 2019 oyebande and odunuga 2010 these three huge basins represent an important topic of studies addressing lulc changes climate variability and hydrological responses 2 1 1 basin level 2 1 1 1 senegal river basin srb the senegal river basin srb fig 1 is located in the western part of the sahel region with a total drainage area of approximately 375 000 km2 and a length of 1800 km the region is inhabited by 3 5 million people the basin is shared by four countries senegal guinea mali and mauritania the rainfall in srb varies from less than 200 mm to the north to about 2000 mm in the south and it is characterized by a rainy season from july to october the srb experienced a severe drought for about 30 years since 1970 almost all previous studies in the senegal basin focused on the variation of streamflow and surface runoff and led to conclude that rainfall is the main driver of surface runoff and streamflow variation on the other hand the quantification of groundwater recharge as well as surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater return flow and their contribution to water recycling within the watershed were less studied further the role of lulc changes and the effects on water balance components has not been deeply investigated senegal river basin experienced a conversion of crop land to other vegetation natural vegetation from 1975 to 2013 barnieh et al 2020 who also reported a gain in urban area likewise the transition from cropland to other vegetation was also detected in the senegal basin barnieh et al 2020 additionally water bodies loss was balanced by gains in other vegetation and wetland moreover an increase in urban area cropland and grassland between 2009 and 2018 was detected faye and du 2021 vittek et al 2014 have reported that from 1975 to 1990 other vegetation increased at the expanse of tree cover most probably due to agricultural expansion 2 1 1 2 niger river basin nrb the niger river fig 1 has a catchment area of 2 1 106 km2 and a length of 4200 km this region is inhabited by more than 100 million people and spans nine countries the rainfall in nrb varies from less than 200 mm in the north to about 2000 mm in the south and it is characterized by a rainy season from july to october a severe and extended drought has occurred in the watershed since 1970 almost all previous studies in the niger basin focused on the variation of streamflow and surface runoff they reported that during the aforementioned drought a first hydrological paradox was suggested in this basin i e the increase in surface runoff despite the decrease in rainfall descroix et al 2013 furthermore other studies reported that in the post drought period characterized by precipitation and vegetation recovery a second hydrological paradox appeared despite the increase in vegetation cover the surface runoff did not show any change the impacts of the vegetation and precipitation recovery were insufficiently investigated especially separating the impacts of these two factors on the other hand the hydrological responses to changes in lulc and climate variability particularly the validity of the hydrological paradoxes at the basin and sub basin level has not been thoroughly evaluated it can be considered a gap in hydrological knowledge in this important basin the niger basin experienced an increase in agricultural crops at the expense of other vegetation and forest as reported by barnieh et al 2020 vittek et al 2014 have reported that from 1975 to 1990 other vegetation increased at the expense of tree cover most probably due to agricultural expansion also obahoundje and diedhiou 2022 and descroix et al 2013 sta documented an expansion of agriculture in the niger basin and the loss of water bodies to cropland in the niger delta 2 1 1 3 lake chad basin lcb the lake chad basin lcb is the largest endorheic lake basin in the world and it is located in the center of the african sahel between 5 19 and 25 29 n latitude and 6 85 24 45 e longitude with an area of 2 5 106 km2 the region is inhabited by 17 4 million people according to delclaux et al 2008 the northern part of the basin is located in the sahara and it does not generate runoff so in this study we consider only the southern part fig 1 the southern part of lcb is covering an area of 1 106 km2 fig 1 and is shared by ten countries the open water area has experienced dramatic changes due to the severe drought since 1970 from large 24 000 km2 to normal or intermediate 18 000 km2 and finally to a small lake fragmented into different separated water bodies as a permanent open water pool 1700 km2 and permanent or seasonal marshes from 2000 to 14 000 km2 lemoalle et al 2012 the rainfall in the lcb varies from less than 100 mm in the north to about 1000 mm in the south and it is characterized by a rainy season from july to september almost all previous studies in the lake chad basin focused on investigating the variation of surface runoff during the drought and post drought periods evaluating at the same time the impacts of lulc changes and climate variability mainly on surface runoff mahmood and jia 2019 zhu et al 2019 furthermore some studies have assessed the impacts of climate change on the lake water balance and reported that groundwater is the main contributor to lake seepage pham duc et al 2020 the groundwater recharge and its role in the lake water balance were insufficiently taken into account and water recycling within the lcb particularly as a consequence of lulc changes was not studied the major lulc changes in lcb from 1975 to 2013 stated by barnieh et al 2020 were the transition of water bodies and wetland around the lake to cropland the loss of water bodies to other vegetation and an increase in urban area at the expense of other vegetation in 1975 1990 other vegetation increased at the expense of tree cover most probably due to agricultural expansion vittek et al 2014 an increase in cropland at the expense of other vegetation was reported by nwilo et al 2020 2 1 2 sub basin selection to illustrate the impact of lulc changes in the sahel we have selected several sub basins as hotspots in terms of lulc transitions at the basin level the major transition in the three watersheds was from bare land and forest to natural vegetation grass and shrub lands at the sub basin level and based on the lulc transition matrix in each sub basin we have considered only one example of each unique transition from one lulc class to another i e if we have 10 sub basins characterized by a transition from bare land to grassland we choose one example of these 10 etc accordingly the selected sub basins were from forest to cropland in sub basin 24 in niger river basin nrb sub24 from forest to urban and grassland in sub basin 23 in niger river basin nrb sub23 from bare land to grassland in sub basin 4 in senegal river basin srb sub 4 from grassland and cropland to water in sub basin 8 in lake chad basin lcb sub8 from forest and grassland to shrub land cropland and urban in sub basin 29 in lake chad basin lcb sub29 2 2 data this study used several datasets to drive the swat model listed in table 1 brief description of these data is given below readers may refer to the relevant references for more details this study covers the period of 1990 2020 the precipitation data were from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps the data was used at daily time steps from 1988 to 2020 atmospheric data including daily minimum and maximum temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation data were extracted from the fifth generation european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis data set ecmwf era5 hersbach et al 2020 this data were used at the daily time step the land use and land cover lulc dataset used in this study were produced by the tsinghua university based on landsat data at a spatial resolution of 30 m feng 2018 xu 2018 zhao 2021 and available for 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 we have used only three years 1990 2010 and 2020 to quantify the impacts of lulc changes on water balance the soil data set was obtained from the digital soil map of the world dsmw version 3 6 produced by the food and agriculture organization fao at a 1 km resolution the physical properties were extracted for each soil texture class from the swat database map window mw interface http swat tamu edu software mwswat the data set on soil properties is compiled from fao world soil data the digital elevation model dem of lcb was clipped out of the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 30 m resolution digital elevation data www earthexplorer usgs gov following our previous study bennour et al 2022 the etmonitor global et product hu and jia 2015 zheng et al 2022 jia et al 2018 was used to calibrate the swat model the validation of swat mode simulations was done using remote sensing retrievals of soil moisture generated by yao et al 2021 applying a neural network algorithm nnsm the nnsm dataset was downloaded from http data tpdc ac cn en data c26201fc 526c 465d bae7 5f02fa49d738 due to the different ways of calculating soil moisture i e swat which simulates surface soil moisture based on an empirical equation and different remote sensing algorithms such as random forest to generate surface soil moisture a systematic bias correction was applied using the mean standard deviation µ σ matching linear regression technique draper et al 2009 lopez et al 2017 rajib et al 2016 the correction was done based on the following equation 1 θ swat θ swat m swat σ rs σ swat m rs where θ swat and θ swat are corrected and original soil moisture respectively μrs and m swat are the mean of soil moisture from remote sensing and swat σ swat and σ rs are the standard deviation of swat and remote sensing soil moisture respectively 3 methodology generally the approach used in this study fig 2 is based on designing and carrying out simulation experiments to assess the individual and combined impacts of lulc change and climate variability on different water balance components of the three basins described in section 2 for the period of 1990 2020 the hydrological model swat was applied to estimate water balance components wbcs for the designed experimental scenarios changing lulc alone changing climate condition alone and the combined changes of these two factors the results of the numerical simulations were analyzed to identify the dominant drivers of the changes in water balance components in the study area in this work the study period was split into three periods i e the post drought period 1990 2000 the near post drought 2001 2010 and the far post drought period 2010 2020 based on precipitation evolution in the three watersheds the hydrological responses to lulc changes and climate variability were assessed during the near post drought 2001 2010 in this period the rainfall decreased in both niger river and lake chad basins while it increased in the senegal river basin compared to the post drought period 1990 2000 during the far post drought period 2010 2020 rainfall increased in both lake chad and senegal river basins while it decreased steadily in the niger river basin compared with the post drought period fig a1 these different rainfall trends might have had different impacts on the water balance of basins and sub basins before carrying out the numerical simulation experiments the swat model was calibrated using actual evapotranspiration et data derived from remote sensing product based on etmonitor model bennour et al 2022 for validation the soil moisture simulated by the calibrated swat model was evaluated by comparing with the remote sensing product of surface soil moisture fig 2 the following sections describe the different steps of the approach 3 1 swat model description 3 1 1 swat model set up the hydrological model swat used in this study is an open source and semi distributed model arnold et al 1998 the model is forced by data on meteorology topography soil properties and lulc and runs on a daily time step to simulate the water balance components in a watershed in this study the arcswat2012 version winchell et al 2013 was set up in the lake chad basin niger and senegal river basins based on a 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem then these three watersheds were disaggregated into sub basins which were further divided into hydrological response units hru s which are the smallest units in the watershed and that are comprised of unique lulc soil and slope combinations neitsch et al 2011 the swat model is not a fully distributed model and the disaggregation of the domain into sub basins and hru s is required to preserve the natural flow paths boundaries and channels required for routing water sediments and pollutants the disaggregation is done by applying a watershed discretization technique based on topographic features neitsch et al 2011 the number of sub basins is determined by the size of the watershed and the spatial resolution of the digital elevation model used for this purpose neitsch et al 2011 in this paper the watersheds were delineated and divided into 29 27 and 26 sub basins for lake chad basin niger and senegal river basins respectively the catchment water balance calculation in the swat model is based on the principle of mass conservation 2 sw t sw 0 i 1 n precip i surq i et a i gwrch i gwq i where t is the ending day of numerical simulation n is the duration of the numerical experiment i e total days of simulation the subscript i is the day number i 1 2 3 n sw t is the final soil water content for the entire soil profile mm of the whole simulation period sw 0 is the initial soil water content mm precip is the precipitation mm surq is the surface runoff mm et a i is the actual evapotranspiration mm gwrch is the groundwater recharge water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile mm and gwq is the groundwater return flow mm the simulation was done at daily step all variables in eq 2 are daily values 3 1 2 an indicator of water recycling the ratio of water outflow to water inflow it is interesting to introduce anthropic water diversions for different uses and inter basin water transfer which would modify the natural response of the basins however due to lack of information of where such interventions were applied it is impossible to introduce precisely such anthropic interventions on water flows the swat computes the contributions of each sub basin to streamflow i e wyld surq latq gwq then provides options to describe the use of streamflow in the river channels i e diversions for irrigation or other uses and allows inter sub basin water transfers neitsch et al 2011 we proposed to use the ratio of wyld prec as an indicator for potential water recycling i e the ratio of out in recycling r oir calculated as 3 r oir wyld prec where r oir is the ratio of out in recycling prec is the sum of precipitation over all sub basins km3 wyld km3 is the net amount of water that leaves the sub basin and contributes to streamflow in the reach and calculated as 4 wyld surq latq gwq q tloss where latq km3 is the lateral flow contribution to streamflow and q tl oss km3 is the transmission loss 3 1 3 swat model calibration and validation as in situ data were not available from the three basins the swat model calibration was conducted using actual evapotranspiration data derived from remote sensing observations following the calibration approach in our earlier work bennour et al 2022 instead of using run off data as usually done specifically the swat model was calibrated based on etmonitor actual et zheng et al 2022 for 2001 2010 at a monthly time step using swat cup abbaspour 2015 table 2 gave the results of the calibrated parameters the details about the parameter selection and calibration procedure can be found in bennour et al 2022 the validation was done by comparing the simulated soil moisture by the calibrated swat model with surface soil moisture derived from satellite remote sensing observations developed by yao et al 2021 called neural network soil moisture product nnsm see table 1 from 2013 to 2020 at a monthly time step model calibration and validation were evaluated by applying well documented metrics i e coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse kling gupta efficiency kge and percent bias pbias according to moriasi et al 2007 2015 all performance metrics used in this study are described in table 3 3 2 design of numerical simulations for assessing impacts of lulc changes and climate variability on water balance components 3 2 1 design of numerical simulations to investigate the dominant drivers influencing the water balance components in the three basins of the sahel we proposed an approach by carrying out the numerical simulations experiments based on scenarios that 1 the combined changes of these two factors 2 changing climate condition alone 3 changing lulc alone considering that the lulc data are available in 1990 2020 the study period 1990 2020 was split into three sub periods period 1 p1 was in 1990 2000 also taken as the baseline bl period i e p1 bl period 2 p2 was in 2001 2010 and period 3 p3 was in 2011 2020 forced by the daily meteorological and precipitation data and the corresponding lulc data the calibrated swat model was run at a daily step in 1990 2020 the years of 1988 and 1989 were used as a spin up period the daily outputs of the simulated water balance components i e surface runoff surq actual evapotranspiration eta soil water sw groundwater recharge gw rch groundwater return flow gwq and water yield wyld were then integrated to obtain the annual total values for each year which was further averaged over each period to get the 10 year mean of the water balance components of the corresponding period spatially the swat model was run in each hru then aggregated to obtain values of water balance components at the sub basin scale and finally the values at basin scale scenarios experiments were designed to identify the impact roles of lulc changes and climate variability these experiments were carried out by taking corresponding conditions of lulc and climate and described below 1 the combined impacts by lulc change and climate variability on wbcs numerical simulation was conducted by running the calibrated swat model forced by the daily meteorological and precipitation data from ear5 and chirps between 1990 and 2020 and the lulc data of 1990 2010 and 2020 were used to embody the lulc conditions for each one of the three periods p1 1990 2000 p2 2001 2010 p3 2011 2020 the simulated results of the mean values of annual water balance components in the baseline period p1 bl 1990 2000 were taken as the reference referred to as baseline values the mean values of annual water balance components in the other two periods p2 2001 2010 p3 2011 2020 were compared with the baseline values following the equation below 5 wbc pi wbc pi wbc bl where wbc pi is the change in a water balance component between the corresponding period pi p2 or p3 and the baseline period p1 wbc pi is the value of the water balance component in the corresponding period wbc bl is the value of the water balance component in the baseline period this experiment eq 5 gave the results of the combined impact of the actual conditions of lulc changes and climate variability in the two periods of 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 because the impacts were not distinguished 2 impacts of climate variability on wbcs to evaluate the impacts of the climate variability alone on the wbc we assumed no change in lulc condition for the entire period in 1990 2020 frozen as the condition in 1990 the swat model was run by taking lulc in 1990 and actual daily meteorological and precipitation data in 1990 2020 we divided the period of 2001 2020 into two climate scenarios 2001 2010 as climate scenario 1 cls1 2011 2020 as climate scenario 1 cls2 the impact of climate variability on a wbc in each climate scenario period was calculated as 6 wbc cli wbc clsi wbc bl where wbc cli is the change in a water balance component between the corresponding period cls1 or cls2 and the baseline period wbc clsi is the value of the water balance component for either cls1 or cls2 wbc bl is the value of a water balance component in the baseline period this experiment eq 6 gave the results of impact by climate variability only during the two periods of 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 3 impacts of lulc change on wbcs the quantification of impact of lulc change alone on the water balance components we assumed that daily meteorological and precipitation conditions in the period of 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 were the same as that in 1990 2000 frozen meteorological and precipitation conditions we divided the period of 2001 2020 into two lulc scenarios 2001 2010 as land use scenario 1 lus1 by using lulc data of 2010 and 2011 2020 as land use scenario 2 lus2 by using lulc data of 2020 the swat model was run for the entire period of 1990 2020 by taking the frozen meteorological and precipitation data in 1990 2000 and corresponding lulc data for the corresponding lulc data for each period the impact of lulc change on a wbc in each lulc scenario period was calculated as 7 wbc lui wbc lusi wbc bl where wbc lui is the change in a water balance component between the corresponding period lus1 or lus2 and the baseline period wbc lusi is the value of a water balance component for either lus1 or lus2 wbc bl is the value of a water balance component in the baseline period this experiment eq 7 gave the results of impact by lulc change only during the two periods of 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 3 2 2 impact score of lulc change and climate variability on wbcs the impacts of the changes in lulc and of climate variability on water balance components i e δsurq δeta δgw rch δsw δgwq and δwyld were estimated by eqs 6 7 for each lulc scenario lus1 and lus2 and each climate scenario cls1 and cls2 relative to the baseline to identify which factor dominated the

that r2 nse and kge were higher than 0 7 and pbias lower than 15 moreover this high performance of swat calibration was confirmed by comparing actual et across the sub basins of the three basins fig

watersheds during 2001 2010 were evaluated using climate 2001 2010 and during 2011 2020 using climate 2011 2020 with frozen lulc at lulc1990 named cls1 and cls2 respectively these experiments were evaluated by taking the corresponding wbcs in the climate baseline period i e climate 1990 2000 with lulc1990 fig 6d e and f as a reference the impacts of lulc change on eta surq sw gw rch gwq and

wbcs in the climate baseline period i e climate 1990 2000 with lulc1990 fig 7d e and f as a reference fig 7g i and j l show the abundance of lulc types and the changes in lulc types during the two lulc scenarios named lus1 and lus2 respectively senegal river basin the assessment of climate variability impacts on wbcswais done as described in section 3 2 1 2 i e based on the changes in wbcs during cls1 and cls2 compared to the baseline climate the precipitation precip increased during both cls1 and cls2 i e in the near and far post drought periods compared to post drought period which led to a rise in all wbcs fig 6d particularly during the far post drought period i e cls2 the rainfall increased by about 20 km3 which led to a rise in fresh water availability and expanding water recycling within the basin by increasing surface runoff groundwater return flow and lateral flow by 8 km3 3 km3 and 1 6 km3 respectively fig 6d table 4 moreover a rise in groundwater recharge by 3 km3 was estimated table 4 during the three periods the dominant lulc classes were shrub land grassland bare land cropland and forest respectively covering 30 50 10 7 and 2 of the watershed fig 7g water bodies wetland and urban areas were minor lulc types less than 0 5 table a2 the assessment of lulc change impact on wbcs was done as described in section 3 2 1 3 based on the changes in wbcs during cls1 and cls2 compared to the baseline climate and lulc the changes in lulc were a decrease in bare land forest and cropland area and an expansion of grassland and shrub land fig 7j the expansion of natural vegetation in the three watersheds led to an increase in actual et and a decline in freshwater availability due to the decrease in surq gwq and latq fig 7d table4 niger river basin the assessment of climate variability impact on wbcs was done as described in section 3 2 1 2 based on the changes in wbcs during cls1 and cls2 compared to baseline the precipitation during cls1 and cls2 near and far post drought periods compared to bl decreased with a resulting decrease in all water balance components fig 6e the continuation of the severe drought i e the decrease in precipitation clearly affected the freshwater availability and water recycling within the niger river basin the dominant lulc classes were shrub land grassland bare land cropland and forest respectively covering 20 30 28 18 and 3 of the watershed fig 7h water bodies wetland and urban areas were minor lulc types less than 0 5 table a3 the assessment of lulc change impact on wbcs was done as described in section 3 2 1 3 based on the changes in wbcs during lus1 and lus2 compared to the baseline scenario the changes in lulc were characterized by a decrease in bare land and forest area and an expansion of grassland shrub land and cropland fig 7k the expansion of natural vegetation in the three watersheds led to an increase in actual et and a decline in freshwater availability by decreasing surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater return flow fig 7e table 4 lake chad basin the assessment of climate variability impact on wbcs was done as described in section 3 2 1 2 based on the changes in wbcs during cls1 and cls2 compared with the baseline climate during the near post drought period a decrease in rainfall was estimated which led to a decline in all water balance components compared to the post drought period bl during the far post drought period the precipitation increase triggered a rise in all water balance components particularly surface runoff lateral flow and return flow fig 6f i e an increase in freshwater availability and water recycling the dominant lulc classes were shrub land grassland bare land cropland and forest respectively covering 45 40 3 10 and 2 of the watershed fig 7i water bodies wetland and urban areas were minor lulc types less than 0 5 table a4 the assessment of lulc change impact on wbcs was done as described in section 3 2 1 3 based on the changes in wbcs during lus1 and lus2 compared with the baseline climate and lulc the changes in lulc were characterized by a decrease in bare land and forest area and an expansion of grassland shrub land and cropland fig 7l the expansion of natural vegetation in the three watersheds led to an increase in actual et with a decline in freshwater availability and potential water recycling by decreasing surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater return flow fig 7l table 4 4 2 2 2 water recycling assessment the results on the water ratio in out recycling r oir index indicated that this index had a value of 0 2 0 07 and 0 2 in srb lcb and nrb respectively table 5 which means that water yields from the watershed were about 20 7 and 20 of the precipitation in srb lcb and nrb respectively hence an amount of water s transferred from sub basins upstream to the next sub basin downstream within the watershed which we call water recycling thus water recycling provides an additional volume of water which could be diverted for irrigation or to another reservoir from upstream to downstream we did not explore it further for the reasons explained earlier set 3 4 4 2 2 3 impact assessment by sub basins after we selected the hotspots in terms of lulc change we analyzed the combined impacts of lulc change and climate variability on actual evapotranspiration surface runoff soil water groundwater recharge groundwater return flow and water yield in response to these transitions the average annual changes of water balance components in response to the change in lulc area between lulc1990 and lulc2020 and between climate 1990 2000 and 2011 2020 are shown in fig 8 the greatest positive change of actual evapotranspiration caused by the combined impact of lulc change and climate variability 4 7 km3 was in sub basin 8 of the lake chad basin fig 8 d1 as regards the analysis of the separate impacts of lulc change and climate variability the increase in eta was mainly caused by climate variability 3 8 km3 specifically the increase in precipitation fig 8 d2 rather than the increase in natural vegetation fig 8 d3 the most significant decline in surface runoff groundwater recharge and groundwater return flow caused by the combined impact of climate variability and lulc change appeared in sub basin 23 of niger river basin fig 8 b1 after investigating the separate impacts of lulc change and climate variability we found that this decrease of three variables was mainly due to climate variability fig 8 b2 rather than lulc change fig 8 b3 the sub basin 24 in nrb showed an increase in surface runoff fig 8 c3 despite the rainfall deficit due to the increase in cropland at the expense of forest fig 8 c2 and c4 the highest increase in surface runoff groundwater recharge and groundwater return flow caused by climate variability and lulc change was in sub basin 29 of lake chad basin fig 8 e1 after examining the separate impacts of the two drivers we figured out that this increment in surface runoff groundwater recharge and groundwater return flow was triggered by climate variability fig 8 e2 4 2 3 the contribution of specific lulc types to the impact of lulc change overall the results fig 9 indicated that the re greening of the study area caused by the increase of grassland and shrub land at the expense of bare land and forest loss led to an increase in actual et which triggered a decrease in surq in the senegal river fig 9 a1 and a2 and niger river basins fig 9 b1 and b2 both lus1 and lus2 are characterized by an important gain of grassland and shrub land at the expense of bare land this gain triggered a rise in actual et and a decrease in surq accompanied by an increase in gw rch and sw fig 9 a3 and a4 the niger river basin showed a gain in cropland which led to reduce the decline of surq the increase in shrub land area led to a rise in gw rch and sw but it was smaller than the decline caused by forest loss on the contrary a noticeable gain in the grassland area was detected but the grassland actual et increased slightly fig 9 b3 and b4 in the lake chad basin fig 9 c1 and c2 an expansion in shrub land and cropland areas at the expense of bare land was identified causing an increase in actual et and a decline in surq at the same time the reduction in forest triggered a decrease in gw rch and sw fig 9 c3 and c4 a meager increase in grassland about 100 km2 was estimated while the actual et decreased due to the shifting of grassland from the humid to arid part of the watershed barnieh et al 2022 human contribution plays an important role in the evolution of sahel region s hydrological response the water balance variation however was mostly impacted by the re greening of the sahel through the expansion of shrub land and grassland at the expense of bare land and forest the man made lulc changes had a crucial contribution to the increase of actual et and surq mainly by the expansion of cropland in the niger river and lake chad basins furthermore we have calculated the percentage contribution of the water yield by each major lulc type to the total wyld of all major lulc classes then we investigated the change in the percentage contribution from 1990 to 2020 to identify the lulc types which highly reduced water yield table 6 in srb the wyld decreases was related to the loss in bare land and crop land the decrease in forest had a positive impact on wyld in nrb the increase in shrub land and grassland at the expense of bare land led to a decrease in wyld furthermore the increase in crop land had a negative impact on wyld contrariwise forest loss had a positive impact on wyld in lcb mainly the conversion of bare land to shrub land and grassland had a major impact on wyld decline 4 2 4 impacts of lulc changes vs climate variability the impact scores cr of the lulc change cr lu and climate variability cr cl on each water balance component i e eta surq gw rch and sw were calculated for p2 2001 2010 and p3 2011 2020 according to the procedure described in section 3 2 2 eqs 8 and 9 and given in table 7 an absolute value of cr lu of a variable close or higher than 1 means that variable is impacted by a lulc change if the absolute value of cr cl of the variable is close or higher than 1 it means the variable is impacted by climate variability in the senegal river basin during p2 climate variability was the dominant driver in increasing the actual et with cr cl 0 85 and decreasing sw cr cl 1 15 at the same time the lulc change was the main driver of increasing gw rch with cr cl about 0 57 the combined lulc change and climate variability decreased surq mainly due to the impact of lulc changes which led to its decrease with cr lu about 2 3 in contrast climate variability contributed to the increase in surq with cr cl 1 5 i e lower and opposite sign than the impact of lulc change during p3 climate variability was the dominant driver of the rises in eta sw gw rch and surq with cr cl values of 0 79 0 96 0 87 and 1 45 respectively scores of cr lu are much smaller in the niger river basin the eta gw rch and sw were highly impacted by climate variability with cr cl equal to 1 32 0 95 and 1 01 respectively during p2 and 1 43 1 02 and 0 82 respectively during p3 in both periods the surq which was decreasing during both p2 and p3 was impacted mainly by the lulc changes with cr lu values equal to 1 01 and 0 82 respectively in lake chad basin the actual et sw and gw rch were highly affected by climate variability with cr cl equal to 1 05 0 99 and 0 94 respectively during p2 and 0 83 0 97 and 0 98 respectively during p3 the surq was decreasing during p2 and it was mainly influenced by lulc changes with cr lu equal to 1 78 while during p3 surq was increasing and it was influenced by climate variability with cr cl equal to 1 15 5 discussion 5 1 calibration and validation performance according to moriasi et al 2007 2015 and kouchi et al 2017 the pbias values indicate the goodness of the model performance in our study the calibration of the swat model in the three watersheds using remote sensing actual et from etmonitor etmonitor eta at monthly time steps gave pbias values 15 the pbias values in this study were lower than those found in the study by odusanya et al 2019 in the ogun river basin in nigeria using actual et from mod16 mod16 eta and gleam gleam eta the outcomes of our study were also confirmed by poméon et al 2018 when they used mod16 for swat model validation in west africa furthermore our results agreed with lopez et al 2017 findings in morocco the validation results in our work were also confirmed by poméon et al 2018 and odusanya et al 2019 when they calibrated and validated the swat model using remote sensing soil moisture they reported that the dynamic of the swat sm fit very well with the remote sensing sm retrievals esa cci ssm in the upper few centimeters of the soil profile in most of the basin at a monthly time step 5 2 comparison with previous studies we compared our results with previous studies table a5 the huge difference between the results of the first two studies by sane et al 2020 in the upper reach of the senegal river basin srb is due to the difference in study areas and periods the three other studies simulated the surface runoff surq in different sub catchments of srb during recent periods the results of the two studies carried out by faty et al 2019 and sun et al 2013 showed comparable surface runoff values with our study furthermore the above mentioned three studies were carried out in small catchments in srb while in our study the surq was estimated for the whole srb the first two studies numbers 9 and 10 in table a5 in the niger river basin nrb showed surq values lower than that in our study andersen et al 2012 descroix et al 2009 these two studies were carried out in two small catchments in the nrb while our study was done for the whole nrb therefore it might be concluded that these difference in the simulated surq between our study and other studies in smaller areas was partly due to the difference in spatial coverage moreover the study by mamadou et al 2015 in the small koris basin in nrb showed comparable results to ours likewise in the lake chad basin lcb almost all studies in previous work were done in the chari logone basin whereas our study was carried out for the entire southern lcb studies numbered 16 19 in table a5 descroix et al 2009 lemoalle et al 2012 mahamat nour et al 2021 zhu et al 2017 showed comparable results to our study furthermore the majority of the studies in the three watersheds have different spatial and temporal coverage which leads to some differences compared to our findings however the surface runoff simulated in our study is comparable to recent studies in different catchments 5 3 assessment of combined and separate impacts of lulc changes and climate variability in srb the decrease in surq during period 2 p2 2001 2010 compared to the baseline p1 bl 1990 2000 due to the dominant impact of natural vegetation expansion in decreasing surq this outcome agrees with the findings of diop et al 2017 who reported a decrease in the upper reach of srb while the increase in surq during and period 3 p3 2011 2020 compared to the baseline p1 bl 1990 2000 is explained by the dominant impacts of climate variability in increasing surq this finding is confirmed by wilcox et al 2018 the increase in groundwater recharge gw rch was also detected by other studies which did not provide estimates of groundwater recharge which led to a rise in return flow hollis 1990 in lcb the decrease in surq during p2 compared to the baseline can be explained by the combined impacts of lulc changes and climate variability as also confirmed by mahmood and jia 2019 on the other hand surq increased during p3 compared with the baseline similar results was reported by pham duc et al 2020 the latter study also underscored the contribution of groundwater to the recovery of the open water area of the lcb still they did not mention or quantify the role of water recycling in the nrb the estimated decrease in surq and gw rch during both p2 and p3 does not agree with the findings of boulain et al 2009 and favreau et al 2009 i e that both surq and gw rch increased despite a rainfall deficit in two small catchments in nrb during the post drought period in the srb the rise in surq gw rch and return flow gwq during both cls1 2001 2010 and cls2 2011 2020 compared to baseline 1990 2000 was caused by the increase in rainfall these findings of our study agree with oyebande and odunuga 2010 on the other hand in the nrb the decline in surq gw rch and gwq caused by the deficit in rainfall during both cls1 and cls2 does not agree with the findings of descroix et al 2013 although they documented the decrease in actual et due to the decline of rainfall however in some small catchments in the nrb descroix et al 2018 reported a reduction of surq due to the rainfall deficit in lcb the decline in surq during cls1 was clearly caused by rainfall deficit as also confirmed by mahmood and jia 2019 furthermore our outcomes of increase in gw rch gwq and surq during cls2 agreed with the study by pham duc et al 2020 the decline in surq was due to the increase in actual et triggered by the gain in natural vegetation vegetation recovery at the expense of bare land and forest loss during both lus1 lulc2010 and lus2 lulc2020 compared to baseline lulc1990 this evidence emerged in the three watersheds similar result was also reported by faty et al 2019 particularly in the upper reach of srb this decrease in surq was also noted by mahmood and jia 2019 in the lcb however boulain et al 2009 and favreau et al 2009 reported an increase in surq and gw rch in the nrb which disagrees with our findings our findings on a decrease in surq due to lulc change in nrb agreed with daramola et al 2022 the decrease in surq was more noticeable in srb compared to nrb and lcb this is probably due to the loss of cropland in srb while the crop area increased in nrb and lcb these results suggest that an increase in cropland may trigger an increase in surq as also found by several studies guzha et al 2018 lørup et al 1998 mao and cherkauer 2009 op de hipt et al 2019 also in agreement with aich et al 2015 and descroix et al 2009 according to giertz et al 2005 this increase in surface runoff caused by cropland expansion could be explained by the decrease of macroporosity caused by the reduction of biological activity as a result of the disturbance of the soil by agricultural activities the surface runoff increase is also probably due to the decrease in interception caused by land clearing and tree removal which leads to a decrease in canopy interception further studies could be carried out by using satellite observation based data product e g zheng and jia 2020 among others to analyzing the impact of lulc change on the in canopy rainfall interception thereafter on wbcs in addition the conversion from forest to cropland after land clearance reduces direct evaporation which increases surface runoff leblanc et al 2008 mounirou et al 2020 the results of this study on the decrease in surface runoff due to natural vegetation expansion disagreed with trichon et al 2018 and descroix et al 2018 who reported that the re greening of the sahel did not reduce the surq at the same time this gain in cropland was accompanied by a spread of natural vegetation at the expense of bare land loss which led to an increase in actual et in the same catchment ogutu et al 2021 the water yield decreased in response to such lulc change specifically the decline in surq was larger than the increase in gwq and latq in srb on the other hand the decrease in surq led to a decline in water yield in lcb the decline in potential water recycling as consequence of lulc change was mainly due to the vegetation recovery at the expense of bare land loss the expansion of cropland in the niger river basin had also a negative impact on water yield while the deforestation had a positive impact on water yield in the three watersheds the re greening of the region by expansion of grassland and shrub land led to an increase in actual et and to a decrease in surq as confirmed by yonaba et al 2021 and ogutu et al 2021 this vegetation recovery played a major role in increasing gw rch and soil water content sw and these results agreed with marshall et al 2012 this finding applied to three watersheds but the change was larger in nrb and lcb than that in srb and in agreement with mahmood and jia 2019 both climate variability and lulc change had nearly similar impacts on the hydrological response in the srb the lcb was more sensitive to the lulc change during p2 this process significantly reduced water availability by decreasing the surq and increasing the water loss via evapotranspiration because of the higher actual et in contrast climate variability was the main driver of increasing surq during p3 as also reported by pham duc et al 2020 the nrb was essentially impacted by climate variability our study did not mean to say that our approach in general and independently from site specific knowledge might be directly used by water managers rather that it could be applied to understand better the hydrology in large and complex basins even more specifically our study shows how lulc affects hydrological processes across a range of scales and basins with different hydrological characteristics and climate variabilities and therefore how land management could aim at modifying water flows 6 conclusions the assessment of the combined impacts of changes in lulc change and climate variability revealed that during the near post drought period 2001 2010 the water balance components both the absolute magnitude of water balance components and their relative fractions in the three watersheds were rather different than that in the post drought period 1990 2000 also as baseline period in the far post drought period 2011 2020 our findings indicated an increase in water balance components compared to the post drought period in senegal river and lake chad basins and a decrease in the niger river basin these changes triggered a shortage of freshwater availability and showed that the first sahelian hydrological paradox see introduction i e a rise in surface water runoff despite the decline of precipitation did not apply to niger river basin furthermore our findings indicated that the second hydrological paradox see introduction i e a continuous increase in surface runoff despite the re greening of the sahel did not apply to our study period and regions during the far post drought period an increase in rainfall was estimated in both the srb and the lcb leading to a rise in freshwater availability and water recycling because of the increase in water yield in the nrb the shortage of water supply continued resulting in the continuation of the drought in the basin which showed that the sahelian hydrological paradoxes described in the introduction did not apply at basin level these findings confirmed the rejection of the hypothesis paradox that is sahel re greening did not decrease surface runoff in lcb and srb the increase in water yield caused by climate variability played an important role in improving water availability in the basin furthermore the man made extension of cropland at the expense of the forest loss had an important role in mitigating the decrease in surface runoff moreover the continuous population growth led to an increase in the cultivated area at the expense of forest loss i e a further increase in surface runoff the latter may contribute to water recycling through water transfer from a sub basin upstream to the next sub basin downstream these findings emphasized the crucial role of water recycling within the watershed as well as gave a good hydrological insight into the interrelation of water and land management in the study area the lulc change was the major responsible driver for the decrease in surface runoff and water yield especially in the nrb during both the near post drought cr lu 1 and far post drought cr lu 0 85 periods and in the lcb during the far post drought cr lu 1 8 period thus investigating the relationship between hydrologic response and lulc change in river basins at various spatial scales can help identify vulnerable sub basins due to lulc changes this could help prioritize effective land management practices to preserve sustainable water management as a summary of this study in recent years far post drought period the combined impact of lulc change and climate variability indicated an increase in most of water balance components in lcb and srb while it shows a decrease in most of water balance components was estimated in nrb while seperate impact of lulc change indicated an increase in actual et resulted in the decreases in surface runoff groundwater recharge and groundwater return flow in srb nrb and lcb these changes were triggered by the expansion of natural vegetation in the sahel watersheds and implied a steady reduction in water availability as well as a limited water recycling in the basin caused by lulc change the separate impact of climate variability showed that the reduction of precipitation in the nrb augmented the water scarcity and this could be an alert of desertification in the basin in the srb and lcb the increase in precipitation led to an increase in surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater return flow the latter increased potential water recycling and freshwater availability as a consequence of climate variability this increase in precipitation led to a rise in groundwater recharge as well funding this work was jointly funded by the project supported by the key

7641,study region weihe river basin of china study focus in recent decades changing environments destroyed the natural structure of streamflow making accurate streamflow prediction challenging this study develops a multi regime markov switching generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity ms garch model to predict daily streamflow time series with structural breaks sb named arima autoregressive integrated moving average ms garch model consequently the multi regime arima ms garch model is compared with other classical single regime arima garch models to evaluate whether and to what extent it improves streamflow prediction accuracy new hydrology insights for the region there exist structural breaks in the daily streamflow time series and the number of breakpoints at each station varies the garch model ignores the description of volatility aggregation in the daily streamflow time series α β the arima ms garch model r2 and nse in the range of 0 682 0 984 and 0 582 0 935 respectively outperforms the arima garch model r2 and nse in the range of 0 558 0 935 and 0 077 0 721 respectively for daily streamflow prediction and the arima garch model seriously overestimates the peak values the ms garch model based on the student s t distribution is more suitable for daily streamflow prediction than that based on the normal distribution in which mae and re reduce by 23 90 52

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate streamflow prediction is of great significance for water resources management regulations flood control ding et al 2015 seo et al 2019 drought mitigation et al steinemann 2006 and also provides guidance for the construction of water conservancy engineering facilities eum and kim 2010 however the dynamic spatiotemporal characteristics of streamflow time series have become more complex with the intensified climate change and anthropogenic activities in recent years guo et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 which makes accurate streamflow prediction more difficult generally the data driven models with easy implementation and simple operation have been widely used in the field of hydrology kambalimath and deka 2021 li et al 2019 modarres and ouarda 2013 parisouj et al 2020 ray and sarma 2016 especially researchers have paid more attention to the application of time series models in hydrological time series prediction fathian et al 2018 fathian et al 2019a among these the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model and the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity garch model have been often used to model the conditional mean and conditional variance information in streamflow time series fathian et al 2019b fathian and vaheddoost 2021 hu et al 2020 mehdizadeh et al 2019 pandey et al 2019 wang et al 2012 xie et al 2016 zha et al 2020 and obtained satisfactory results it is worth noting that the premise of garch modeling is the heteroscedasticity or arch effect existing in the residual series obtained by the conditional mean model arima the arch effect means a large change followed by a large change and a small change followed by a small change or the residual series is independent and the residual squared series is autocorrelated however in light of the thinking about the above published research papers we found a question that does the dataset used for prediction in the time series i e the training period remain consistent in structure over different periods previous studies ignored this and directly modeled the entire dataset holding the model parameters unchanged which may result in erroneous arch or garch effects hillebrand 2005 mikosch and stărică 2004 a structural break unexpected changes in regression model parameters over time implies the instability of the time series that is to say the time series structure is inconsistent on both sides of the breakpoint which means that the inappropriate model or parameter scheme leads to large prediction errors and unreliability cheung 1993 reported that the observed long memory behaviors in time series may be due to overlooked structural breaks yusof et al 2013 demonstrated the true long term persistence by examining structural breaks in daily rainfall time series but this does not mean that the structural break has no effect on the judgment of the characteristics of the time series therefore it would be an interesting attempt to consider structural breaks when predicting streamflow using traditional time series models which may help improving model prediction performance teterin et al 2016 at present the idea of regime change has been widely used in the field of hydrology as one of the most popular regime switching methods the markov switching model ms can determine the transition probabilities between different regimes of the time series and the smoothed probabilities of each regime rahmouni et al 2021 showed that the ms model has certain advantages in hydrological drought forecasting akintug and rasmussen 2005 and nasri et al 2020 also demonstrated that ms models play an important role in streamflow series prediction in the streamflow time series analysis the characteristics of streamflow fluctuations under different regimes may be different based on this adding the ms idea to the traditional volatility model ms garch may improve streamflow prediction by accurately calculating the regime of the volatility change at the next moment ms garch models are flexible enough to switch volatility processes over time through discretizing latent variables and also to quickly adapt to changes in unconditional volatility levels marcucci 2005 the specific details of the ms garch model are given in section 3 2 the main work of this study is to construct a multi regime switching model considering structural breaks arima ms garch to predict the daily streamflow time series specifically the bai and perron 2003 test was used to identify structural breaks in the daily streamflow time series to distinguish different fluctuation states and the state of streamflow fluctuations at the next moment can be inferred from the calculated regime change probability calculated by the markov transformation idea to achieve the purpose of accurate prediction and the results are compared with the classical single regime garch models the data used are daily streamflow time series from five stations in the weihe river basin additionally this study also answers the key question do there exist structural changes in the daily streamflow time series the study is organized as follows the next section describes the study area section 3 provides detailed information on the methods the modeling process and prediction results are presented in section 4 sections 5 and 6 discuss and summarize the results from the above section respectively this study attempts to make up for the shortcomings of hydrological time series analysis and expand the scope of application of such methods 2 study area and data as the largest tributary of the yellow river the weihe river is the second longest continental river in china which fig 1 originates from niaoshu mountain in gansu province located in a warm temperate zone with a semi humid continental climate zhao et al 2016 the weihe river is the mother river of shaanxi province with a length of 502 4 km and a drainage area of 67 108 km2 in the province the weihe river has a far reaching influence on the economic and social development of shaanxi and occupies an important position in the national development strategy of the western region wang et al 2021 in addition the weihe river provides about 85 of the water supply for xi an city and several smaller cities such as baoji weinan and xianyang studies have shown that streamflow in the weihe river basin has decreased significantly wei et al 2008 hou et al 2011 which is closely related to large scale human activities such as super irrigation and soil and water conservation in order to meet the food demand brought by population growth a large amount of uncultivated land in the watershed was converted into irrigation areas which seriously affected the spatial temporal variation of streamflow chang et al 2015 meanwhile climate change mainly manifested by reduced precipitation and higher temperatures also contributed to streamflow reduction number of large reservoirs and pumping projects have been built to solve the problem of insufficient water demand for crops due to reduced precipitation these projects readjust seasonal discharges and intra year allocations for any given year chang et al 2015 reported that human activities had a greater impact on streamflow in the weihe river basin than climate change factors compared with nature human disturbance is mainly reflected in streamflow volatility and the fluctuation pattern varies with different human events this brings inconvenience to the management and allocation of water resources in the basin therefore it is of great significance to carry out streamflow prediction in this basin considering the high quality reliability and availability of the data the daily streamflow data of five hydrological stations in the weihe river basin including two tributaries in the basin are selected for this study table 1 the data are used to construct subsequent arima garch and arima ms garch models to evaluate the prediction performances the description information of the hydrological stations is given in table 1 for convenience the abbreviations of each hydrological station are used in the following descriptions we divide the last year of the streamflow series for the selected period into the testing period and the rest as the training period to establish the models fig 2 table 2 provides the statistical characteristics of the streamflow time series at each station the figure shows that the mean median and standard deviation of the lt station are significantly higher than those of the other stations which means that the lt station has larger volatilities the kurtosis of the jkh station is largest indicating that the probability density function of streamflow has a light tail positive skewness values at each station imply long tailed features on the right hand side of the probability density function of the streamflow time series 3 methodology 3 1 arima garch model the autoregressive integrated moving average model arima is suggested for modeling the nonstationary time series the observation and residual at period t are denoted by y t and ε t respectively and c is the mean of the model α 1 α p and β 1 β q are the autoregressive and moving average parameters with orders p and q respectively and d is the order of stationary difference the general arima p d q can be expressed as follows 1 y t c i 1 p α i y t i j 1 q β j ε t j ε t the arima model can effectively describe the first order information conditional mean of time series the second order information conditional variance is usually captured using the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity garch model bollerslev 1986 which is developed based on the arch model engle 1982 the typical garch model for a residual series ε t obtained from the arima model can be expressed as follows 2 σ t 2 h t var ε t ε u u t ω i 1 v φ i ε t i 2 j 1 m θ j σ t j 2 3 ε t σ t e t e t normal 0 1 where σ t 2 h t is the conditional variance of the residual series ω is a constant and i 1 v φ i and j 1 m θ j are the parameters of the garch model with orders v and m the sum of the parameters φ and θ of the garch model is less than 1 the akaike information criterion aic and the maximum likelihood estimation method are applied for order selection and parameters estimation of the arima garch model respectively 3 2 ms garch model the markov switching ms model can analyze the time series with structural breaks or different k regime states the ms model assumes that a hidden markov chain can be established to represent the unobservable regime k at time t and estimate the location μ k scale σ k and smoothed regime probabilities ξ k t the general form of the two regimes is expressed as follows 4 ε t φ μ k σ k p 1 1 ξ k 1 t p 2 2 ξ k 2 t where the p 1 1 and p 2 2 are the fixed probabilities of the probability density function of each regime k as a hidden markov chain the probability transition matrix π k k of a stochastic process transitioning from a given state k 1 to the next one k 2 can be represented as follows 5 π p 1 1 p 1 2 p 2 1 p 2 2 p i j p k t 1 j k t i μ k σ k ε t to estimate the transition matrix π during the filtering process this paper uses the gaussian process to filter the stable probability of the regime k generated series ε t 6 p k t 1 2 π σ k e 1 2 ε t σ k 2 from the resulting filtered probabilities we can get the location μ k and scale σ k parameters mentioned above as well as the transition probability matrix π furthermore to avoid abrupt changes in regime probabilities at t the filtered probabilities of regime k are smoothed as a supplementary estimate this process obtains a smoothed regime probability ξ k t for each regime and series these smoothed probabilities are represented by the matrix p ξ 1 t ξ 2 t finally we use the transition probability matrix π and the regime smoothed probability matrix p at time t to predict the probability of each regime at time t 1 7 ξ 1 t 1 ξ 2 t 1 π ξ 1 t ξ 2 t the general form of the markov switching garch model can be expressed as follows 8 ε t s t k i t 1 d 0 h k t where d 0 h k t is a consistent distribution with zero mean and time varying variance h k t furthermore the latent variable s t defined in the discrete space 1 k evolves according to the state transition matrix π in eq 5 with the conditional variance of y t following the garch type model haas et al 2004 the regime s t k as condition h k t consists of the function of past observed and the regime dependence vector of parameters θ k and h k t can be expressed as follows 9 h k t h y t 1 h k t 1 θ k where the function h ensures the positive of the conditional variance we assume that h k 1 h k k 1 k where h k represents the fixed initial variance of regime k that is assumed the unconditional variance in regime k the general form is expressed as follows 10 h k t ω k α k ε t 1 2 β k h k t 1 where ω k 0 α k 0 β k 0 and α k β k 1 k 1 k and the parameters θ k ω k α k β k are estimated by the maximum likelihood method then we get the markov switching garch 1 1 model and the standard normal distribution is selected for residual series distribution to build the models in this study 3 3 comparative evaluation methods the evaluation indicators used in this study include absolute error

represent the observed and predicted values of the daily streamflow time series respectively q and q represent the mean of observed and predicted values of streamflow respectively and n is the length of the series of the testing period nonparametric kernel density estimation kde is introduced to compute prediction intervals which is based on point prediction results guo et al 2021a 2021b for a given sample x the expression of kde is as follows 15 f ˆ x 1 nh i 1 n k x x i h where x i is the uncertainty multiplier h represents the bandwidth k is the kernel function which is defined as a gaussian kernel function the h and k are represented as 16 h 1 06 s n 1 2 17 k x x i h 1 2 π exp x x i 2 2 h 2 where s represents the sample standard deviation the symmetric probability f α 2 f 1 α 2 at the nominal level of 0 95 was chosen to calculate the prediction upper limit x up t and lower limit x low t which can be expressed as 18 x up t x i f 0 975 t 19 x low t x i f 0 025 t where the f 0

accuracy uncertainty are expressed as 20 riw 1 n t 1 n x up t x low t x 21 cr t 1 n m t n 100 where m t represents the number of observations within the prediction upper and lower bounds and is obtained by 22 m t 1 if x up t x x low t 0 else the ranges of riw and cr are 0 and 0 100 respectively the higher cr and the smaller riw indicate the stronger prediction performance of the models 3 4 test programs 3 4 1 test for autocorrelation the ljung box test lb is used in this study to test the autocorrelation characteristic in residual time series obtained from the arima model ljung and box 1978 under the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation the asymptotic distribution of the q statistic is χ m 2 with m degree of freedom the modified q statistic is expressed as follows rasool et al 2014 23 q r n n 2 k 1 m r k 2 n k 24 r k t k 1 n ε t ε t k t 1 n ε t 2 where the estimation of autocorrelation of the k order lag residual is r k m and n are the number of lags and sample size respectively 3 4 2 test for heteroskedasticity before building the garch model it is necessary to test the residuals obtained from the linear time series the engle s lagrange multiplier test lm engle 1982 is selected to test the existence of conditional heteroscedasticity arch effect in residual series the null hypothesis of the lm test is that there is no arch effect in the time series for the detailed process of the lm test one can refer to engle 1982 3 4 3 structural breaks the structural disruption can lead to deviations in the estimated results of the garch model lamoureux and lastrapes 1990 therefore this paper combines the structural transition into the garch model to model the daily streamflow time series specifically the number of regimes in the streamflow time series is diagnosed according to the number of detected structural breakpoints when constructing the ms garch model that is when the number of breaking points is n then the number of regimes is n 1 in this regard we use the bai and perron 2003 test to identify the structure of the streamflow time series the detailed steps of which can be found in bai and perron 2003 4 results 4 1 identification of stationarity and structural breaks before building the models the existence of structural breaks and stationarity features for the streamflow time series of each station need to be explored the adf test indicates that the streamflow time series after the first order difference is stationary table 3 according to table 3 we also found that there are structural changes in the streamflow time series of all stations specifically there are two breakpoints at the jkh station on july 25 1992 and september 6 1994 only one break occurred in the zjs station november 26 1996 note that the maximum four breaks occurred in the lt april 20 1988 august 8 1991 november 25 1994 july 15 2003 and bd november 1 1993 september 22 1996 june 8 1999 september 17 2001 stations moreover there are three breakpoints at the xy station jul 2 1988 nov 26 1993 jul 14 2003 4 2 model establishment of daily streamflow time series 4 2 1 arima garch model for daily streamflow time series based on the above stationarity test we established an arima model according to the aic for extracting the conditional mean information of the streamflow time series of each station here we also carried out autocorrelation test of model residuals as one of the constraints when choosing the order to ensure that the established model is valid the p values of the autocorrelation and arch effect test of the residual series are shown in table 4 the residual series obtained from the arima model is not autocorrelated but the residual squared series is autocorrelated in addition the p values of the lm test are all less than 0 05 indicating that the null hypothesis of no arch effect is rejected therefore there is a heteroscedasticity effect in residual or streamflow series which requires us to establish a volatility model garch and msgarch to eliminate it the second column of table 5 provides the formula information of the single regime garch 1 1 model for each station the streamflow time series in all stations have large garch terms indicating that the volatility of the past has a large influence on the current conditional volatility and the volatility of the streamflow time series persists the table also shows that the volatility arch term garch term at jkh lt and bd stations 0 9990 are stronger than that in zjs 0 977 and xy 0 927 stations 4 2 2 arima ms garch model for daily streamflow time series according to table 3 there are structural breaks in the streamflow time series of each hydrological station indicating that the model constructed in this study considering structural changes is necessary based on the obtained number of breakpoints we constructed an ms garch model of this number plus one regime that is the regime switching models for jkh zjs lt bd and xy stations are three two five five and four state garch models respectively table 5 reports the construction information of the garch and ms garch models of the streamflow time series at each station parameters α and β represent the short term and long term persistence of streamflow volatilities respectively the short term persistence is mainly affected by external shocks and the source of long term persistence is the previous volatility there are different volatility regimes in the same station which further illustrates the correctness of our construction of ms garch specifically the parameters of the garch n model show that the streamflow volatilities at each station have long term persistent characteristics and the ability to describe the fluctuation aggregation is poor the multi regime ms garch n model is more sensitive to the streamflow volatility aggregation effect under each regime in contrast garch t and ms garch t models can describe the long and short term memory of streamflow volatilities in single regime and multi regime it can be seen from the parameters of single regime garch n and multi regime ms garch n models with normal distribution of residuals that the streamflow time series from the jkh station has higher volatility relatively speaking the garch n model shows a slightly lower volatility regime and the ms garch n model shows two higher volatility regimes similarly the single regime shows that the lt and bd stations have one high volatility regime respectively but the multi regime shows that the lt station has one low and four high volatility states while the bd station has five high volatility states for the xy station the garch n model displays a relatively low volatility state while ms garch n shows one low and three high volatility states the size of h k t for different states described by the multi regime ms garch n model is mainly determined by the constant term coefficient ω k therefore it can be found that the high volatility state in the same station follows the h k t of the latter state which is greater than that of the former state the parameters of the single regime and multi regime models with student s t distribution of residuals indicate that the streamflow volatility is affected by the external environment and previous fluctuations like the ms garch n model the ms garch t model can distinguish the streamflow volatility forms in each regime but the expression results of the two models are different in the ms garch t model the streamflow volatility level is higher in the later regime which can be seen from the parameter ω but this rule is not shown in the ms garch n model fig 3 shows the regime transition probabilities of the streamflow time series for each station described by the ms garch model it is found that the state of high streamflow fluctuation at each station hardly shifts to the low fluctuation and the state of low fluctuation tends to change to the previous high fluctuations but it is not universal in summary it is more common for all fluctuation states of the streamflow series in the five stations to remain unchanged in the original mode followed by the shift to high fluctuation fig 4 shows the smoothed probabilities filtered probabilities and filtered condition volatility of the streamflow time series at five stations under different regimes according to fig 4 we find an interesting phenomenon that the volatility of the streamflow time series increases sharply when the smoothed probabilities of the last regime are close to one which is similar to the results observed by ardia et al 2018b it is also found that the smoothed and filtered probabilities of all regimes are approximately equal to the stable probabilities of the corresponding regime 4 3 evaluation of model prediction performance table 6 provides the streamflow prediction evaluation indicators at five stations the higher mae indicates that the average difference between the predicted and observed values of the arima garch n model is relatively large which means that the garch model under the gaussian distribution has a weaker ability to capture daily runoff fluctuations while the arima ms garch t model has a lower average level of prediction errors the re shows that the prediction effects of arima garch t and arima ms garch t models are better and more reliable the r2 values also indicate better prediction goodness of arima garch t and arima ms garch t models in addition nse also provides extensive information on the predicted values and servat and dezetter 1991 believe that it reflects the effect of the overall fitting of the hydrological curve compared with the arima garch model the arima ms garch model has better predictive performance because the nse is closer to 1 table 6 especially for the arima ms garch t model fig 5 provides a scatter plot between the predicted and observed values of these models it can be seen that the scatters predicted by the arima ms garch t model are closer to that of the observed reflecting the superior performance of this model in daily streamflow time series prediction in order to prove the model performance described by the scatter plot r2 and nse were used to explain in addition to the plot r2 describes the degree of collinearity between predicted and observed values while nse represents how well scatter points fit a 1 1 line through the analysis in table 6 the degree of collinearity and fit between the predicted and the observed values of the ms garch model are superior fig 6 shows the comparison of streamflow prediction uncertainty intervals of models 1 2 3 and 4 in the five stations the figure illustrates that the uncertainty interval of the arima ms garch model based on the student s t distribution is narrower than that of the other 3 models and the single regime arima garch model based on the normal distribution is wider the cr indices of all models in the 5 stations are higher than 93 table 7 indicating that all models have high reliability a lower riw value means that the arima ms garch t model has a smaller prediction uncertainty while the arima garch n model has a larger uncertainty combining fig 6 and table 7 it is found that the distribution form has a greater impact on the uncertainty of streamflow prediction which comes from the fact that the riw values of the arima ms garch n model at jkh and lt stations are higher than those of the arima garch t model taken together these results indicate that the prediction results of the arima ms garch t model are more reliable and have higher prediction performance 5 discussion this work applied the arima model combined with two volatility classical single regime garch multi regime ms garch models to model and predict the daily streamflow time series at five hydrological stations in the weihe river basin the results show that the arima model can effectively describe the conditional mean value of the daily streamflow time series i e the first order moment information but the lm test also indicates the existence of the arch effect in the streamflow time series while eq 1 suggests that the arima model cannot extract the volatility information wang et al 2012 xie et al 2016 so we used two garch type models to extract conditional volatility i e second order moment information in the residuals of the arima model the results show that the prediction performances of the arima garch and arima ms garch models are both acceptable the volatility of the daily streamflow time series described by the single regime garch model shows that the current conditional volatilities in each station are mainly from the influence of past fluctuations indicating that the streamflow time series conditional volatilities have long term persistent characteristics which is consistent with the research results of guo et al 2021a 2021b however the impact of past shocks on current volatilities is very small that is the garch model does not show the volatility aggregation characteristics of streamflow time series this may be related to the fact that the garch model ignores the structural breaks of the streamflow series the single regime garch is modeled in the entire training period with a large span of time while the volatility aggregation occurs in a small range of time therefore this feature is difficult to reflect in the garch model this may cause misjudgment of streamflow volatility and affect subsequent prediction effects hillebrand 2005 mikosch and stărică 2004 structural break testing indicated that the daily streamflow time series used in our study had structural breaks table 3 shows that the streamflow in the weihe river basin experienced frequent structural breaks from 1990 to the beginning of 2000 chang et al 2015 pointed out that unlike other periods that were mainly affected by human activities the percentages of streamflow changes caused by climate change and human activities in the 1990 s were 53 and 47 respectively and the absolute and relative combined effects of natural and artificial on runoff were most significant in the 1990 s accounting for 54 34 108 m3 and 58 respectively this means that the streamflow has complex changes and fluctuation patterns during this period precipitation analysis showed that the basin experienced a prolonged drought in the 1990 s which was 15 6 less than the pre 1970 average the temperature has always been higher than the long term average temperature after 1994 and the annual average temperature exist a step change point in 1999 in response to food demand large amounts of uncultivated land were converted to irrigated areas at the same time amounts of water conservancy engineering facilities have been built to provide protection for crop water demand which has a profound impact on the interannual and interannual changes in streamflow in order to repair the water and soil loss problem in the watershed a series of soil conservation measures were carried out which continued to expand over time these projects altered the local micro topography intercepted precipitation increased water infiltration and reduced the streamflow as the reductions of different measures are varied the streamflow fluctuation regimes vary with human events however scholars did not consider the problem of series structure such as the study by fathian et al 2018 fathian et al 2019a fathian et al 2019b pandey et al 2019 our work illustrates that the issue of structural transformation of time series needs to be taken into account when modeling therefore we introduced combined markov switching with the garch model to establish the ms garch model to describe the volatility of streamflow time series we chose the number of regimes larger than the number of breakpoints by 1 to build the ms garch model at the corresponding station the multi regime ms garch model shows that the volatility of the streamflow time series has not just one regime for the same station the number of regimes was selected based on the number of structural breakpoints at each station and the modeling results show that the volatility characteristics are indeed different at the same station which means that our research is feasible compared with the single regime garch n the ms garch n model can extract more volatility aggregation in the streamflow time series which can be proved by the results of the zjs lt and xy stations especially at the xy station the results of the two type models are opposed that is the garch n model assumes long term persistence of streamflow fluctuations while the ms garch n model shows short term persistence the main reason for this large discrepancy may be caused by the special breakpoints location of the series structure which makes the weak long term persistence of streamflow within each regime the single regime garch t model under the student s t distribution can not only capture the long term persistence of streamflow volatilities but also describe the aggregation which is different from the garch n model the multi regime ms garch t model assumes that the sources of streamflow volatilities in different states of the same station are distinct while the ms garch n model considers the sources of volatilities in each state are consistent in most stations it can be seen that the ms garch model taking the structural transition of the daily streamflow time series into account is more accurate in extracting volatility additionally the ms garch model allows for patterns of streamflow volatilities to vary across regimes specifically we can capture the probabilities of volatilities in different regimes at the next moment according to eq 5 transition matrix and eq 7 state smoothing matrix which makes the ms garch model more flexible in the prediction process therefore the performance of the ms garch model is relatively superior in daily streamflow time series prediction since both arima and garch models are deterministic functions of previous observations there is a temporal misalignment between the predicted and measured values of the single regime arima garch model which leads to large prediction errors at streamflow extremes and the arima garch model is established for the entire training period and is more sensitive to changes in previous observations reducing the prediction effect the multi regime arima ms garch model not only divides the different structural regimes of streamflow but also calculate the probability of the regime at the next moment therefore for streamflow prediction the arima ms garch model has a more accurate grasp of the streamflow variation form and the prediction effect has been improved to a certain extent in addition the prediction performance of the arima ms garch t model with student s t distribution of residuals is better than that of the arima ms garch n model this study combines the idea of structural transformation to establish a multi regime ms garch model to describe the volatility which provides a new direction and a new idea for hydrological time series prediction although the accuracy of this method is improved based on single regime garch there are still shortcomings in this study in the process of structural break testing we directly use the training period data as the test object maybe it is better to test the mean and volatility of the time series separately in future research and the multi regime models are established for these respectively which may generate better prediction performance in addition with the rapid development of the economy and society frequent human activities and abnormal climate change the changes in the volatility of the hydrological time series in the future are difficult to predict therefore this study can provide a reference and foundation for future hydrological time series analysis it is necessary to consider multi regime time series models for future hydrological time series research 6 conclusions it is well known that the temporal and spatial dynamics of hydrological time series are complex and changeable although adding the garch model to describe the volatility can improve the prediction performance of the single mean arima model neglecting the changes of structure in series limits the prediction performance based on this our research combined the idea of structural transformation with the garch model to construct a multi regime ms garch to extract volatility considering two residual distributions gaussian and student s t distribution the prediction performance was compared and evaluated with a single regime garch model the main conclusions of the paper are as follows 1 the streamflow time series of the five hydrological stations used in the study have structural breaks during the training period and the number of breakpoints in the jkh zjs lt bd and xy stations are 2 1 4 4 3 respectively these results not only provide a modeling basis for the multi regime ms garch model but also reflect the research significance of this work 2 ms garch shows that the streamflow volatilities in each regime are different and they are also different from different garch models the regime transition matrix obtained by the ms garch model shows that the volatility tends to maintain the original state or higher from the current moment to the next without shifting to a lower volatility regime 3 the arima ms garch model improved the daily streamflow prediction accuracy of the arima garch model mae and re

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate streamflow prediction is of great significance for water resources management regulations flood control ding et al 2015 seo et al 2019 drought mitigation et al steinemann 2006 and also provides guidance for the construction of water conservancy engineering facilities eum and kim 2010 however the dynamic spatiotemporal characteristics of streamflow time series have become more complex with the intensified climate change and anthropogenic activities in recent years guo et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 which makes accurate streamflow prediction more difficult generally the data driven models with easy implementation and simple operation have been widely used in the field of hydrology kambalimath and deka 2021 li et al 2019 modarres and ouarda 2013 parisouj et al 2020 ray and sarma 2016 especially researchers have paid more attention to the application of time series models in hydrological time series prediction fathian et al 2018 fathian et al 2019a among these the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model and the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity garch model have been often used to model the conditional mean and conditional variance information in streamflow time series fathian et al 2019b fathian and vaheddoost 2021 hu et al 2020 mehdizadeh et al 2019 pandey et al 2019 wang et al 2012 xie et al 2016 zha et al 2020 and obtained satisfactory results it is worth noting that the premise of garch modeling is the heteroscedasticity or arch effect existing in the residual series obtained by the conditional mean model arima the arch effect means a large change followed by a large change and a small change followed by a small change or the residual series is independent and the residual squared series is autocorrelated however in light of the thinking about the above published research papers we found a question that does the dataset used for prediction in the time series i e the training period remain consistent in structure over different periods previous studies ignored this and directly modeled the entire dataset holding the model parameters unchanged which may result in erroneous arch or garch effects hillebrand 2005 mikosch and stărică 2004 a structural break unexpected changes in regression model parameters over time implies the instability of the time series that is to say the time series structure is inconsistent on both sides of the breakpoint which means that the inappropriate model or parameter scheme leads to large prediction errors and unreliability cheung 1993 reported that the observed long memory behaviors in time series may be due to overlooked structural breaks yusof et al 2013 demonstrated the true long term persistence by examining structural breaks in daily rainfall time series but this does not mean that the structural break has no effect on the judgment of the characteristics of the time series therefore it would be an interesting attempt to consider structural breaks when predicting streamflow using traditional time series models which may help improving model prediction performance teterin et al 2016 at present the idea of regime change has been widely used in the field of hydrology as one of the most popular regime switching methods the markov switching model ms can determine the transition probabilities between different regimes of the time series and the smoothed probabilities of each regime rahmouni et al 2021 showed that the ms model has certain advantages in hydrological drought forecasting akintug and rasmussen 2005 and nasri et al 2020 also demonstrated that ms models play an important role in streamflow series prediction in the streamflow time series analysis the characteristics of streamflow fluctuations under different regimes may be different based on this adding the ms idea to the traditional volatility model ms garch may improve streamflow prediction by accurately calculating the regime of the volatility change at the next moment ms garch models are flexible enough to switch volatility processes over time through discretizing latent variables and also to quickly adapt to changes in unconditional volatility levels marcucci 2005 the specific details of the ms garch model are given in section 3 2 the main work of this study is to construct a multi regime switching model considering structural breaks arima ms garch to predict the daily streamflow time series specifically the bai and perron 2003 test was used to identify structural breaks in the daily streamflow time series to distinguish different fluctuation states and the state of streamflow fluctuations at the next moment can be inferred from the calculated regime change probability calculated by the markov transformation idea to achieve the purpose of accurate prediction and the results are compared with the classical single regime garch models the data used are daily streamflow time series from five stations in the weihe river basin additionally this study also answers the key question do there exist structural changes in the daily streamflow time series the study is organized as follows the next section describes the study area section 3 provides detailed information on the methods the modeling process and prediction results are presented in section 4 sections 5 and 6 discuss and summarize the results from the above section respectively this study attempts to make up for the shortcomings of hydrological time series analysis and expand the scope of application of such methods 2 study area and data as the largest tributary of the yellow river the weihe river is the second longest continental river in china which fig 1 originates from niaoshu mountain in gansu province located in a warm temperate zone with a semi humid continental climate zhao et al 2016 the weihe river is the mother river of shaanxi province with a length of 502 4 km and a drainage area of 67 108 km2 in the province the weihe river has a far reaching influence on the economic and social development of shaanxi and occupies an important position in the national development strategy of the western region wang et al 2021 in addition the weihe river provides about 85 of the water supply for xi an city and several smaller cities such as baoji weinan and xianyang studies have shown that streamflow in the weihe river basin has decreased significantly wei et al 2008 hou et al 2011 which is closely related to large scale human activities such as super irrigation and soil and water conservation in order to meet the food demand brought by population growth a large amount of uncultivated land in the watershed was converted into irrigation areas which seriously affected the spatial temporal variation of streamflow chang et al 2015 meanwhile climate change mainly manifested by reduced precipitation and higher temperatures also contributed to streamflow reduction number of large reservoirs and pumping projects have been built to solve the problem of insufficient water demand for crops due to reduced precipitation these projects readjust seasonal discharges and intra year allocations for any given year chang et al 2015 reported that human activities had a greater impact on streamflow in the weihe river basin than climate change factors compared with nature human disturbance is mainly reflected in streamflow volatility and the fluctuation pattern varies with different human events this brings inconvenience to the management and allocation of water resources in the basin therefore it is of great significance to carry out streamflow prediction in this basin considering the high quality reliability and availability of the data the daily streamflow data of five hydrological stations in the weihe river basin including two tributaries in the basin are selected for this study table 1 the data are used to construct subsequent arima garch and arima ms garch models to evaluate the prediction performances the description information of the hydrological stations is given in table 1 for convenience the abbreviations of each hydrological station are used in the following descriptions we divide the last year of the streamflow series for the selected period into the testing period and the rest as the training period to establish the models fig 2 table 2 provides the statistical characteristics of the streamflow time series at each station the figure shows that the mean median and standard deviation of the lt station are significantly higher than those of the other stations which means that the lt station has larger volatilities the kurtosis of the jkh station is largest indicating that the probability density function of streamflow has a light tail positive skewness values at each station imply long tailed features on the right hand side of the probability density function of the streamflow time series 3 methodology 3 1 arima garch model the autoregressive integrated moving average model arima is suggested for modeling the nonstationary time series the observation and residual at period t are denoted by y t and ε t respectively and c is the mean of the model α 1 α p and β 1 β q are the autoregressive and moving average parameters with orders p and q respectively and d is the order of stationary difference the general arima p d q can be expressed as follows 1 y t c i 1 p α i y t i j 1 q β j ε t j ε t the arima model can effectively describe the first order information conditional mean of time series the second order information conditional variance is usually captured using the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity garch model bollerslev 1986 which is developed based on the arch model engle 1982 the typical garch model for a residual series ε t obtained from the arima model can be expressed as follows 2 σ t 2 h t var ε t ε u u t ω i 1 v φ i ε t i 2 j 1 m θ j σ t j 2 3 ε t σ t e t e t normal 0 1 where σ t 2 h t is the conditional variance of the residual series ω is a constant and i 1 v φ i and j 1 m θ j are the parameters of the garch model with orders v and m the sum of the parameters φ and θ of the garch model is less than 1 the akaike information criterion aic and the maximum likelihood estimation method are applied for order selection and parameters estimation of the arima garch model respectively 3 2 ms garch model the markov switching ms model can analyze the time series with structural breaks or different k regime states the ms model assumes that a hidden markov chain can be established to represent the unobservable regime k at time t and estimate the location μ k scale σ k and smoothed regime probabilities ξ k t the general form of the two regimes is expressed as follows 4 ε t φ μ k σ k p 1 1 ξ k 1 t p 2 2 ξ k 2 t where the p 1 1 and p 2 2 are the fixed probabilities of the probability density function of each regime k as a hidden markov chain the probability transition matrix π k k of a stochastic process transitioning from a given state k 1 to the next one k 2 can be represented as follows 5 π p 1 1 p 1 2 p 2 1 p 2 2 p i j p k t 1 j k t i μ k σ k ε t to estimate the transition matrix π during the filtering process this paper uses the gaussian process to filter the stable probability of the regime k generated series ε t 6 p k t 1 2 π σ k e 1 2 ε t σ k 2 from the resulting filtered probabilities we can get the location μ k and scale σ k parameters mentioned above as well as the transition probability matrix π furthermore to avoid abrupt changes in regime probabilities at t the filtered probabilities of regime k are smoothed as a supplementary estimate this process obtains a smoothed regime probability ξ k t for each regime and series these smoothed probabilities are represented by the matrix p ξ 1 t ξ 2 t finally we use the transition probability matrix π and the regime smoothed probability matrix p at time t to predict the probability of each regime at time t 1 7 ξ 1 t 1 ξ 2 t 1 π ξ 1 t ξ 2 t the general form of the markov switching garch model can be expressed as follows 8 ε t s t k i t 1 d 0 h k t where d 0 h k t is a consistent distribution with zero mean and time varying variance h k t furthermore the latent variable s t defined in the discrete space 1 k evolves according to the state transition matrix π in eq 5 with the conditional variance of y t following the garch type model haas et al 2004 the regime s t k as condition h k t consists of the function of past observed and the regime dependence vector of parameters θ k and h k t can be expressed as follows 9 h k t h y t 1 h k t 1 θ k where the function h ensures the positive of the conditional variance we assume that h k 1 h k k 1 k where h k represents the fixed initial variance of regime k that is assumed the unconditional variance in regime k the general form is expressed as follows 10 h k t ω k α k ε t 1 2 β k h k t 1 where ω k 0 α k 0 β k 0 and α k β k 1 k 1 k and the parameters θ k ω k α k β k are estimated by the maximum likelihood method then we get the markov switching garch 1 1 model and the standard normal distribution is selected for residual series distribution to build the models in this study 3 3 comparative evaluation methods the evaluation indicators used in this study include absolute error indicator mean absolute error mae relative error indicator re and dimensionless indicator coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse dawson et al 2007 liu et al 2020 n moriasi et al 2007 11 mae 1 n i 1 n q ˆ i q i 12 re 1 n i 1 n q i q ˆ i q i 13 r 2 i 1 n q i q q ˆ i q i 1 n q i q 2 i 1 n q ˆ i q 2 14 nse 1 i 1 n q i q ˆ i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 where q i and q ˆ i represent the observed and predicted values of the daily streamflow time series respectively q and q represent the mean of observed and predicted values of streamflow respectively and n is the length of the series of the testing period nonparametric kernel density estimation kde is introduced to compute prediction intervals which is based on point prediction results guo et al 2021a 2021b for a given sample x the expression of kde is as follows 15 f ˆ x 1 nh i 1 n k x x i h where x i is the uncertainty multiplier h represents the bandwidth k is the kernel function which is defined as a gaussian kernel function the h and k are represented as 16 h 1 06 s n 1 2 17 k x x i h 1 2 π exp x x i 2 2 h 2 where s represents the sample standard deviation the symmetric probability f α 2 f 1 α 2 at the nominal level of 0 95 was chosen to calculate the prediction upper limit x up t and lower limit x low t which can be expressed as 18 x up t x i f 0 975 t 19 x low t x i f 0 025 t where the f 0

accuracy uncertainty are expressed as 20 riw 1 n t 1 n x up t x low t x 21 cr t 1 n m t n 100 where m t represents the number of observations within the prediction upper and lower bounds and is obtained by 22 m t 1 if x up t x x low t 0 else the ranges of riw and cr are 0 and 0 100 respectively the higher cr and the smaller riw indicate the stronger prediction performance of the models 3 4 test programs 3 4 1 test for autocorrelation the ljung box test lb is used in this study to test the autocorrelation characteristic in residual time series obtained from the arima model ljung and box 1978 under the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation the asymptotic distribution of the q statistic is χ m 2 with m degree of freedom the modified q statistic is expressed as follows rasool et al 2014 23 q r n n 2 k 1 m r k 2 n k 24 r k t k 1 n ε t ε t k t 1 n ε t 2 where the estimation of autocorrelation of the k order lag residual is r k m and n are the number of lags and sample size respectively 3 4 2 test for heteroskedasticity before building the garch model it is necessary to test the residuals obtained from the linear time series the engle s lagrange multiplier test lm engle 1982 is selected to test the existence of conditional heteroscedasticity arch effect in residual series the null hypothesis of the lm test is that there is no arch effect in the time series for the detailed process of the lm test one can refer to engle 1982 3 4 3 structural breaks the structural disruption can lead to deviations in the estimated results of the garch model lamoureux and lastrapes 1990 therefore this paper combines the structural transition into the garch model to model the daily streamflow time series specifically the number of regimes in the streamflow time series is diagnosed according to the number of detected structural breakpoints when constructing the ms garch model that is when the number of breaking points is n then the number of regimes is n 1 in this regard we use the bai and perron 2003 test to identify the structure of the streamflow time series the detailed steps of which can be found in bai and perron 2003 4 results 4 1 identification of stationarity and structural breaks before building the models the existence of structural breaks and stationarity features for the streamflow time series of each station need to be explored the adf test indicates that the streamflow time series after the first order difference is stationary table 3 according to table 3 we also found that there are structural changes in the streamflow time series of all stations specifically there are two breakpoints at the jkh station on july 25 1992 and september 6 1994 only one break occurred in the zjs station november 26 1996 note that the maximum four breaks occurred in the lt april 20 1988 august 8 1991 november 25 1994 july 15 2003 and bd november 1 1993 september 22 1996 june 8 1999 september 17 2001 stations moreover there are three breakpoints at the xy station jul 2 1988 nov 26 1993 jul 14 2003 4 2 model establishment of daily streamflow time series 4 2 1 arima garch model for daily streamflow time series based on the above stationarity test we established an arima model according to the aic for extracting the conditional mean information of the streamflow time series of each station here we also carried out autocorrelation test of model residuals as one of the constraints when choosing the order to ensure that the established model is valid the p values of the autocorrelation and arch effect test of the residual series are shown in table 4 the residual series obtained from the arima model is not autocorrelated but the residual squared series is autocorrelated in addition the p values of the lm test are all less than 0 05 indicating that the null hypothesis of no arch effect is rejected therefore there is a heteroscedasticity effect in residual or streamflow series which requires us to establish a volatility model garch and msgarch to eliminate it the second column of table 5 provides the formula information of the single regime garch 1 1 model for each station the streamflow time series in all stations have large garch terms indicating that the volatility of the past has a large influence on the current conditional volatility and the volatility of the streamflow time series persists the table also shows that the volatility arch term garch term at jkh lt and bd stations 0 9990 are stronger than that in zjs 0 977 and xy 0 927 stations 4 2 2 arima ms garch model for daily streamflow time series according to table 3 there are structural breaks in the streamflow time series of each hydrological station indicating that the model constructed in this study considering structural changes is necessary based on the obtained number of breakpoints we constructed an ms garch model of this number plus one regime that is the regime switching models for jkh zjs lt bd and xy stations are three two five five and four state garch models respectively table 5 reports the construction information of the garch and ms garch models of the streamflow time series at each station parameters α and β represent the short term and long term persistence of streamflow volatilities respectively the short term persistence is mainly affected by external shocks and the source of long term persistence is the previous volatility there are different volatility regimes in the same station which further illustrates the correctness of our construction of ms garch specifically the parameters of the garch n model show that the streamflow volatilities at each station have long term persistent characteristics and the ability to describe the fluctuation aggregation is poor the multi regime ms garch n model is more sensitive to the streamflow volatility aggregation effect under each regime in contrast garch t and ms garch t models can describe the long and short term memory of streamflow volatilities in single regime and multi regime it can be seen from the parameters of single regime garch n and multi regime ms garch n models with normal distribution of residuals that the streamflow time series from the jkh station has higher volatility relatively speaking the garch n model shows a slightly lower volatility regime and the ms garch n model shows two higher volatility regimes similarly the single regime shows that the lt and bd stations have one high volatility regime respectively but the multi regime shows that the lt station has one low and four high volatility states while the bd station has five high volatility states for the xy station the garch n model displays a relatively low volatility state while ms garch n shows one low and three high volatility states the size of h k t for different states described by the multi regime ms garch n model is mainly determined by the constant term coefficient ω k therefore it can be found that the high volatility state in the same station follows the h k t of the latter state which is greater than that of the former state the parameters of the single regime and multi regime models with student s t distribution of residuals indicate that the streamflow volatility is affected by the external environment and previous fluctuations like the ms garch n model the ms garch t model can distinguish the streamflow volatility forms in each regime but the expression results of the two models are different in the ms garch t model the streamflow volatility level is higher in the later regime which can be seen from the parameter ω but this rule is not shown in the ms garch n model fig 3 shows the regime transition probabilities of the streamflow time series for each station described by the ms garch model it is found that the state of high streamflow fluctuation at each station hardly shifts to the low fluctuation and the state of low fluctuation tends to change to the previous high fluctuations but it is not universal in summary it is more common for all fluctuation states of the streamflow series in the five stations to remain unchanged in the original mode followed by the shift to high fluctuation fig 4 shows the smoothed probabilities filtered probabilities and filtered condition volatility of the streamflow time series at five stations under different regimes according to fig 4 we find an interesting phenomenon that the volatility of the streamflow time series increases sharply when the smoothed probabilities of the last regime are close to one which is similar to the results observed by ardia et al 2018b it is also found that the smoothed and filtered probabilities of all regimes are approximately equal to the stable probabilities of the corresponding regime 4 3 evaluation of model prediction performance table 6 provides the streamflow prediction evaluation indicators at five stations the higher mae indicates that the average difference between the predicted and observed values of the arima garch n model is relatively large which means that the garch model under the gaussian distribution has a weaker ability to capture daily runoff fluctuations while the arima ms garch t model has a lower average level of prediction errors the re shows that the prediction effects of arima garch t and arima ms garch t models are better and more reliable the r2 values also indicate better prediction goodness of arima garch t and arima ms garch t models in addition nse also provides extensive information on the predicted values and servat and dezetter 1991 believe that it reflects the effect of the overall fitting of the hydrological curve compared with the arima garch model the arima ms garch model has better predictive performance because the nse is closer to 1 table 6 especially for the arima ms garch t model fig 5 provides a scatter plot between the predicted and observed values of these models it can be seen that the scatters predicted by the arima ms garch t model are closer to that of the observed reflecting the superior performance of this model in daily streamflow time series prediction in order to prove the model performance described by the scatter plot r2 and nse were used to explain in addition to the plot r2 describes the degree of collinearity between predicted and observed values while nse represents how well scatter points fit a 1 1 line through the analysis in table 6 the degree of collinearity and fit between the predicted and the observed values of the ms garch model are superior fig 6 shows the comparison of streamflow prediction uncertainty intervals of models 1 2 3 and 4 in the five stations the figure illustrates that the uncertainty interval of the arima ms garch model based on the student s t distribution is narrower than that of the other 3 models and the single regime arima garch model based on the normal distribution is wider the cr indices of all models in the 5 stations are higher than 93 table 7 indicating that all models have high reliability a lower riw value means that the arima ms garch t model has a smaller prediction uncertainty while the arima garch n model has a larger uncertainty combining fig 6 and table 7 it is found that the distribution form has a greater impact on the uncertainty of streamflow prediction which comes from the fact that the riw values of the arima ms garch n model at jkh and lt stations are higher than those of the arima garch t model taken together these results indicate that the prediction results of the arima ms garch t model are more reliable and have higher prediction performance 5 discussion this work applied the arima model combined with two volatility classical single regime garch multi regime ms garch models to model and predict the daily streamflow time series at five hydrological stations in the weihe river basin the results show that the arima model can effectively describe the conditional mean value of the daily streamflow time series i e the first order moment information but the lm test also indicates the existence of the arch effect in the streamflow time series while eq 1 suggests that the arima model cannot extract the volatility information wang et al 2012 xie et al 2016 so we used two garch type models to extract conditional volatility i e second order moment information in the residuals of the arima model the results show that the prediction performances of the arima garch and arima ms garch models are both acceptable the volatility of the daily streamflow time series described by the single regime garch model shows that the current conditional volatilities in each station are mainly from the influence of past fluctuations indicating that the streamflow time series conditional volatilities have long term persistent characteristics which is consistent with the research results of guo et al 2021a 2021b however the impact of past shocks on current volatilities is very small that is the garch model does not show the volatility aggregation characteristics of streamflow time series this may be related to the fact that the garch model ignores the structural breaks of the streamflow series the single regime garch is modeled in the entire training period with a large span of time while the volatility aggregation occurs in a small range of time therefore this feature is difficult to reflect in the garch model this may cause misjudgment of streamflow volatility and affect subsequent prediction effects hillebrand 2005 mikosch and stărică 2004 structural break testing indicated that the daily streamflow time series used in our study had structural breaks table 3 shows that the streamflow in the weihe river basin experienced frequent structural breaks from 1990 to the beginning of 2000 chang et al 2015 pointed out that unlike other periods that were mainly affected by human activities the percentages of streamflow changes caused by climate change and human activities in the 1990 s were 53 and 47 respectively and the absolute and relative combined effects of natural and artificial on runoff were most significant in the 1990 s accounting for 54 34 108 m3 and 58 respectively this means that the streamflow has complex changes and fluctuation patterns during this period precipitation analysis showed that the basin experienced a prolonged drought in the 1990 s which was 15 6 less than the pre 1970 average the temperature has always been higher than the long term average temperature after 1994 and the annual average temperature exist a step change point in 1999 in response to food demand large amounts of uncultivated land were converted to irrigated areas at the same time amounts of water conservancy engineering facilities have been built to provide protection for crop water demand which has a profound impact on the interannual and interannual changes in streamflow in order to repair the water and soil loss problem in the watershed a series of soil conservation measures were carried out which continued to expand over time these projects altered the local micro topography intercepted precipitation increased water infiltration and reduced the streamflow as the reductions of different measures are varied the streamflow fluctuation regimes vary with human events however scholars did not consider the problem of series structure such as the study by fathian et al 2018 fathian et al 2019a fathian et al 2019b pandey et al 2019 our work illustrates that the issue of structural transformation of time series needs to be taken into account when modeling therefore we introduced combined markov switching with the garch model to establish the ms garch model to describe the volatility of streamflow time series we chose the number of regimes larger than the number of breakpoints by 1 to build the ms garch model at the corresponding station the multi regime ms garch model shows that the volatility of the streamflow time series has not just one regime for the same station the number of regimes was selected based on the number of structural breakpoints at each station and the modeling results show that the volatility characteristics are indeed different at the same station which means that our research is feasible compared with the single regime garch n the ms garch n model can extract more volatility aggregation in the streamflow time series which can be proved by the results of the zjs lt and xy stations especially at the xy station the results of the two type models are opposed that is the garch n model assumes long term persistence of streamflow fluctuations while the ms garch n model shows short term persistence the main reason for this large discrepancy may be caused by the special breakpoints location of the series structure which makes the weak long term persistence of streamflow within each regime the single regime garch t model under the student s t distribution can not only capture the long term persistence of streamflow volatilities but also describe the aggregation which is different from the garch n model the multi regime ms garch t model assumes that the sources of streamflow volatilities in different states of the same station are distinct while the ms garch n model considers the sources of volatilities in each state are consistent in most stations it can be seen that the ms garch model taking the structural transition of the daily streamflow time series into account is more accurate in extracting volatility additionally the ms garch model allows for patterns of streamflow volatilities to vary across regimes specifically we can capture the probabilities of volatilities in different regimes at the next moment according to eq 5 transition matrix and eq 7 state smoothing matrix which makes the ms garch model more flexible in the prediction process therefore the performance of the ms garch model is relatively superior in daily streamflow time series prediction since both arima and garch models are deterministic functions of previous observations there is a temporal misalignment between the predicted and measured values of the single regime arima garch model which leads to large prediction errors at streamflow extremes and the arima garch model is established for the entire training period and is more sensitive to changes in previous observations reducing the prediction effect the multi regime arima ms garch model not only divides the different structural regimes of streamflow but also calculate the probability of the regime at the next moment therefore for streamflow prediction the arima ms garch model has a more accurate grasp of the streamflow variation form and the prediction effect has been improved to a certain extent in addition the prediction performance of the arima ms garch t model with student s t distribution of residuals is better than that of the arima ms garch n model this study combines the idea of structural transformation to establish a multi regime ms garch model to describe the volatility which provides a new direction and a new idea for hydrological time series prediction although the accuracy of this method is improved based on single regime garch there are still shortcomings in this study in the process of structural break testing we directly use the training period data as the test object maybe it is better to test the mean and volatility of the time series separately in future research and the multi regime models are established for these respectively which may generate better prediction performance in addition with the rapid development of the economy and society frequent human activities and abnormal climate change the changes in the volatility of the hydrological time series in the future are difficult to predict therefore this study can provide a reference and foundation for future hydrological time series analysis it is necessary to consider multi regime time series models for future hydrological time series research 6 conclusions it is well known that the temporal and spatial dynamics of hydrological time series are complex and changeable although adding the garch model to describe the volatility can improve the prediction performance of the single mean arima model neglecting the changes of structure in series limits the prediction performance based on this our research combined the idea of structural transformation with the garch model to construct a multi regime ms garch to extract volatility considering two residual distributions gaussian and student s t distribution the prediction performance was compared and evaluated with a single regime garch model the main conclusions of the paper are as follows 1 the streamflow time series of the five hydrological stations used in the study have structural breaks during the training period and the number of breakpoints in the jkh zjs lt bd and xy stations are 2 1 4 4 3 respectively these results not only provide a modeling basis for the multi regime ms garch model but also reflect the research significance of this work 2 ms garch shows that the streamflow volatilities in each regime are different and they are also different from different garch models the regime transition matrix obtained by the ms garch model shows that the volatility tends to maintain the original state or higher

hydrological regionalization national hydrological modeling pisco dataset data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrological models represent an important alternative to provide spatially continuous water discharge simulations across large scale domains zink et al 2017 and provide valuable information on hydrological risk even in areas with limited ground observation data llauca et al 2021a global hydrological models ghms have been used in a wide range of applications such as the global reconstruction of naturalized river flow lin et al 2019 flood forecasting lavers et al 2019 climate change assessment hattermann et al 2017 global water economy dolan et al 2021 and ecosystem services janse et al 2019 the implementation of ghms has increased significatively since the explosion of global data availability from satellites in the last decades tang et al 2009 sood and smakhtin 2015 suggest that ghms should not aim to replace more locally focused modeling efforts where finer spatial resolutions are needed in that sense national hydrological models nhms are becoming an increasingly popular tool for providing information not only in gauged locations but also all ungauged river reaches for instance nhms are currently applied for seasonal water forecasts in sweden girons lopez et al 2021 climate change impacts on peak river flows in great britain kay et al 2021 and assessing the risk of floods and droughts in new zealand mcmillan et al 2016 in peru the increasing hydrological risks huggel et al 2015 and water use put pressure on water resources drenkhan et al 2015 combined with the larger country size 1 285 220 km2 low density of fluviometric stations and short flow data records llauca et al 2021b have prompted hydrologists and decision makers to extend efforts for more systematic and nationwide water resource analyses national scale modeling requires dealing with its own challenges mcmillan et al 2016 mention that national model input data will depend on the country size climate variability and catchment characteristics in a data scarcity context many river reaches are poorly gauged or lack any observations and continuous flow data records are often economically and logistically unfeasible vereecken et al 2008 many of nhms applications use physically based and high resolution hydrological models e g wep cn vic mike she wrf hydro that require a large number of inputs at huge computational costs rodriguez and tomasella 2016 contrariwise some studies in peru lavado casimiro et al 2011 llauca et al 2021b saavedra et al 2021 have shown that conceptual hydrological models such as the framework for understanding structural errors clark et al 2008 and the génie rural rainfall runoff models mouelhi et al 2006 are also capable to adequately represent hydrological processes in catchments with different characteristic the application of conceptual rainfall runoff models in large scale domains needs to be linked to river routing models such as rapid david et al 2011b hyperstream piccolroaz et al 2016 mizuroute mizukami et al 2016 and others to simultaneously compute water discharges in thousands of river reaches as is shown in lin et al 2019 in that sense a hybrid modeling framework combining rainfall runoff and river routing models represents a low resource alternative for operational national daily streamflow simulation in data scarce countries such as peru parameter selection for a national model requires procedures that can be applied to many catchments and ungauged catchments the central premise is searching for similarities between catchments to identify homogeneous hydrological areas song and james 1992 a first way to deal with the extrapolation of hydrological information from a gauged catchment donor to an ungauged one receptor is by employing the spatial proximity criteria pagliero et al 2014 where model parameters are transferred from a neighbor gauged catchment recent studies have introduced other methods for hydrological regionalization in large scale hydrological models for instance beck et al 2020 use the dissimilarity concept for transferring model parameters from donor to receptor catchments in a global model narbondo et al 2020 apply a physical based approach using the richards baker flashiness index to predict runoff in ungauged catchments rau et al 2019 use the empirical relationship between geomorphological characteristics and conceptual model parameters pagliero et al 2019 incorporate a partial least squares regression and clustering analysis for hydrological regionalization kratzert et al 2019 apply the entity aware long short term memory ea lstm network for regional rainfall runoff modeling and bock et al 2016 use the sensitivity analysis of the rainfall runoff and runoff variability indices to identify national hydrological calibration zones this study aims to develop a national hydrological model to investigate the following research questions a how can similarity based regionalization help to implement hydrological models in a data scarce country b how can available national datasets be applied to simulate daily flow series in thousands of river reaches simultaneously c how does the national hydrological model perform in peruvian catchments with different characteristics for this purpose we use cluster and dissimilarity approaches to identify pairs of donor and receptor sub catchments across entire peru furthermore gridded meteorological datasets are used to drive a hybrid hydrological framework that combines a conceptual rainfall runoff model and a river routing model finally we introduced a new hydrological dataset of daily flow series in 11913 river reaches in peru this new dataset is helpful for short term flood risk scenario simulations and long term water resource planning as the outcomes can provide valuable information for hydrologists and water resource managers in peruvian regions with limited or no access to in situ networks 2 data and methods 2 1 study domain peru is located in northwest south america the andes mountain range creates a complex topography and determines hydroclimatic variability along three main drainages the pacific atlantic and titicaca fig 1 the peruvian national water agency reports that the pacific titicaca and amazon drainages represent respectively 21 7 3 8 and 74 5 of the peruvian territory however the accessibility of freshwater resources in peru is the converse of population density 88 of the population lives along the pacific coast around titicaca and in the andean zones of the amazon basin where only 2 of the freshwater resources are available lavado casimiro et al 2012 peruvian hydroclimatology is influenced by the disruption of the large scale circulation patterns caused by the andes cordillera the contrasting oceanic boundary conditions and the landmass distribution garreaud et al 2009 atmospheric moisture from the atlantic ascends the andean slope and leads to high orographic rainfall rates over the eastern divide amazon lavado casimiro et al 2011 contrary the weak rainfall along the pacific coast western divide is related to the large scale mid tropospheric subsidence over the southeastern subtropical pacific ocean enhanced by the coastal upwelling of cold water lavado casimiro et al 2012 rainfall is highly variable in both space and time arid conditions with low rainfall rates characterize coastal areas on the pacific slopes 150 mm year while semi arid conditions 400 mm year prevail in the western flanks of the andes rau et al 2019 the atlantic and titicaca divides are characterized by humid and semi arid conditions respectively with high rainfall rates over the eastern andean slopes 1100 mm year at the andes amazon transition 3200 mm year and in the amazon basin 2550 mm year aybar et al 2020 according to lavado casimiro 2013 the rivers in the pacific divide are characterized by steep slopes they are not very long and their rainfall and discharge peaks occur simultaneously the rivers in amazon divide are characterized by steep slopes in the andes and near zero slopes in the amazon lowlands the rainfall peaks occur two months before the discharge peaks in the amazon plains and simultaneously in the andes the titicaca endorheic drainage is characterized by mean slopes and because it is in the highlands the average response between rainfall and discharge peaks is one month the study domain includes transboundary catchments shared with ecuador colombia and brazil with an approximate total drainage area of 1 480 620 km2 fig 1 given that the success of a similarity based regionalization approach depends on the use of a large and highly diverse set of catchments beck et al 2020 the study domain was divided into 11 913 sub catchments with a mean size of 120 km2 following the same river network as the geoglows ecmwf streamflow services sanchez lozano et al 2021 this spatial discretization considers a unique river stream per sub catchment to compute water discharge all catchments in the study domain and its sub catchments were previously classified as gauged 73 and ungauged 27 considering the 43 fluviometric stations displayed in fig 1a 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 the pisco dataset the peruvian interpolated data of the senamhi s climatological and hydrological observations pisco is a hydrometeorological dataset developed for the peruvian territory including transboundary catchments it contains gridded sub products of precipitation p air temperature ta and potential evapotranspiration pet with a 0 1º spatial resolution at daily and monthly time steps recently llauca et al 2021b incorporated a new sub product of monthly streamflow simulations at the national level pisco hym gr2m in a vector river flowline format the pisco dataset has been widely used in recent studies to assess the hydrological processes in peruvian catchments asurza véliz and lavado casimiro 2020 fernandez palomino et al 2021 saavedra et al 2021 the piscop ta pet sub products are available from 1981 to 2016 stable versions however an unstable version only for piscop is available from 1981 to the present and it is daily updated for senamhi s operational purposes piscop aybar et al 2020 is generated by using geostatistical and deterministic methods that include three precipitation sources a the quality controlled national rain gauge dataset b radar gauge merged precipitation climatologies and c the climate hazards group infrared precipitation chirp estimates similarly piscota is obtained from a time series of maximum and minimum air temperature data b a soil temperature product from the modis sensor moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and c geographic predictors e g elevation longitude latitude and topographic dissection index piscopet is generated from the previous piscota data following the methodology proposed by hargreaves and samani 1985 the pisco dataset is freely available on the iri data library website http iridl ldeo columbia edu sources senamhi hsr pisco in this study and for operational purposes the mean areal values of p and pet were calculated for each sub catchment from 1 january 1981 31 march 2020 the piscop unstable version was selected to extend the data baseline beyond 2016 at the same time we used only daily climatological values of piscopet due to the lack of an unstable version similar to piscop 2 2 2 discharge data the observed daily flow series of 43 fluviometric stations were selected from the common period of 1 january 1981 31 march 2020 a total of 79 of the stations belong to the national service of meteorology and hydrology of peru senamhi https www gob pe senamhi precisely in the amazon region atlantic slope most of the stations are monitored by the senamhi and by the french institute for sustainable development ird in the framework of the hybam project https hybam obs mip fr the detail of selected stations is summarized in table 1 and their spatial distribution is shown in fig 1a the selection processes consider a daily flows series with quality control b fluviometric stations with at least 40 15 years of record length for period 1981 2020 c streamflow gauges with stage discharge rating curves with at least 10 streamflow measurements per year and distributed during dry and wet periods and d stations strategically located in river streams with major drainage areas that are used for hydrologic calibration in strategic gauges with record lengths less than 40 mal poc pcq lna cum lag lpa pau and pcu a continuous 4 year record period within 1981 2020 was required to be considered for hydrologic model calibration 2 3 similarity based regionalization approach 2 3 1 predictor maps we used an a priori defined similarity criterion incorporating four climatic p precipitation ta air temperature pet potential evapotranspiration ai aridity index and three physiographic slo surface slope clay soil clay content ftc fraction of tree cover characteristics which can be found in table 2 according to beck et al 2015 and barbarossa et al 2018 these characteristics are strongly related to streamflow signatures in this study drainage area was not considered due to the high level of catchment discretization for semi distributed modeling and with sub catchments of similar sizes near 120 km2 also the snow cover fraction was not taken into account as a predictor due to most peruvian catchments being dominated by pluvial contribution aybar et al 2020 fernandez palomino et al 2021 maps of mean annual p ta and pet values were calculated for the period 1981 2010 ai was calculated from p and pet in case of ftc slo and clay mean annual maps were computed from available data during 1981 2010 finally the mean areal values of each predictor were calculated for all sub catchments gauged and ungauged across the study domain 2 3 2 cluster analysis and dissimilarity assessment hydrological models often rely on regionalization approaches to transfer information from gauged donor to ungauged receptor catchments according to beck et al 2016 2020 benefits of the similarity based approach include a its relative ease of implementation b retainment of model parameter interaction because the entire parameter set is transferred and c the possibility of spatial variability in model parameters according to landscape characteristics even in ungauged regions this work uses a similarity based approach fig 2 since a previous study has found it outperformed well in the pacific slope asurza véliz and lavado casimiro 2020 showing that it is possible to transfer calibrated parameter sets based on explicit consideration of climatic and physiographic similarity before pairing donor receptor sub catchments we apply a gauged sub catchment classification procedure as the main idea was to obtain more than one set of model parameters per catchment during model calibration and increase the number of donor candidates during parameter transfer the final number of parameter sets by each gauged calibrated catchment will be equal to clusters in it for this we conduct a hierarchical cluster analysis using the predictor maps as descriptors to avoid increasing parameter uncertainties during calibration we adopted a maximum number of clusters per catchment of three seven climatic and physiographic descriptors at the sub catchment level were computed from predictor maps see table 2 the dissimilarity between donors and receptors was computed using the following equation proposed by beck et al 2016 1 s i j p 1 7 z p i z p j iqr p where s is the dissimilarity z are the values of the respective descriptor p denotes the descriptor and i and j mean respectively the donor and the receptor sub catchment in question iqr is the interquartile range of the descriptor and represents the spatial variability in all descriptor the division by iqr in equation 1 was necessary to equalize the data variability of descriptors from equation 1 it follows that a similar sub catchment yields an s value close to zero then dissimilarity values compose a distance matrix 3367 receptors x 8546 donors which characterizes the variability of the sub catchments in the region of interest we also incorporate the spatial proximity criterion selecting the most similar donor with the lowest s value from no more than 300 km distance this was considered to avoid sub catchment donors from too long distances and different drainage regions 2 4 national hydrological modeling 2 4 1 hybrid modeling framework we conduct a hybrid framework to develop the sub catchment national hydrological model fig 2 first meteorological data p and pet is used to drive a conceptual rainfall runoff model which estimates runoff volumes ru at each sub catchment then rainfall runoff outputs are inputs for a river routing modeling to generate daily streamflow q across the river network details of both models are described as follows 2 4 1 1 rainfall runoff model the variable infiltration capacity arno vic model liang et al 1994 todini 1996 was selected because of its flexibility and computational efficiency despite several simplifications the model is designed to provide a relatively complete representation of the dominant hydrologic fluxes addor and melsen 2019 lane et al 2019 here we select de arno vic model incorporated in the framework for understanding structural errors fuse developed by clark et al 2008 using the fuse r package vitolo et al 2016 the fuse framework has 79 unique model structures by combining components of existing hydrological models the arno vic structure has a single state variable for the upper soil layer s1 the lower soil layer s2 can be defined by a single nonlinear baseflow reservoir of fixed size evaporation e is modeled in both soil layers and computed based on the relative root fractions in each soil layer percolation q12 takes available water from wilting point θwilt to saturation θwilt the surface runoff qsx is conceptualized using the arno vic parameterization upper zone control and a gamma distribution is used for the time delay runoff readers can find more details about the model equations in clark et al 2008 2 4 1 2 river routing model the routing application for parallel computation of discharge rapid which uses a matrix based version of the muskingum routing scheme was applied to compute water discharge in thousands of river reaches simultaneously david et al 2011b rapid is an open source model available at https github com c h david rapid david et al 2011a follum et al 2017 lin et al 2015 salas et al 2018 tavakoly et al 2017 the muskingum method can be rearranged by introducing a transboundary matrix t i c 1 n as described by david et al 2015 in the rapid model 2 i c 1 n t q t t b t t c 1 q t t where t is time δt is the river routing time step i is the identity matrix n is the river network matrix q is a vector of outflows from each reach and c 1 is a diagonal parameter matrix for a given reach j we use the connectivity information from the geoglows ecmwf streamflow services sanchez lozano et al 2021 to create the network connectivity matrix n sub catchment runoff is connected to the routing scheme at the upstream node of each river reach and flow output from the model represents flow at the downstream node table 3 2 4 2 model calibration and validation we first execute the hybrid framework only for gauged sub catchments to find optimal model parameters the model was calibrated and validated for the period with simultaneously observed streamflow and input data we choose 60 of available records for calibration and 40 for validation periods the calibration strategy was the same as that used by llauca et al 2021b we consider a unique calibration step for the pacific and titicaca drainages and a stepwise calibration approach seven steps for the atlantic slope due to the number of fluviometric stations and complexity of river network on the amazon basin the shuffled complex evolutionary sce ua algorithm duan et al 1993 was applied to optimize the model parameters an artificial year 1980 of a warm up period was used before computing performance metrics this year was created using p and pet daily climatologies to avoid discarding model simulations since 1 january 1981 the kling gupta efficiency kge criterion gupta et al 2009 evaluated over daily streamflow time series was used as objective function streamflow simulations were also assessed through the nash sutcliffe squared efficiency nsesqrt criterion chiew et al 1993 the mean absolute relative error mare and the percent bias bias to take into account different hydrograph aspects the same selected statistical metrics summarized in table 4 were computed for calibration validation and the total simulation period 2 4 3 leave one out cross validation the similarity based hydrological regionalization approach is used in this study to transfer model parameters from gauged to ungauged catchments thus the uncertainties surrounding the regionalization procedure should be evaluated by applying a cross validation procedure to assess the regionalization skill wang et al 2021 leave one out cross validation loocv was conducted to assess the quality of transferring parameters for this each catchment is in turn considered as pseudo ungauged while the regionalization approach is applied to estimate its flows parajka et al 2005 then the remainder gauged catchments are candidates of donors and regionalization procedure was applied to transfer model parameters from the catchments with the least dissimilarity index finally the simulated streamflow at the pseudo ungauged catchment is then compared with observation and statistical metrics kge nsesqrt mare and bias are computed loocv was only applied to 15 catchments in the pacific drainage see table 1 and statistical metrics obtained with loocv was compared with the independent model calibration for total period 2 4 4 streamflow simulation across the country first we transfer optimal parameters from donor to receptor sub catchments considering a unique set of model parameters for each hydrological sub zone then a new model run was computed for all catchments and the respective gauged and ungauged sub catchments to simulate daily flow series 1981 2020 across the national river network fig 2 also monthly and yearly flow series were computed to assess the seasonal september august and interannual 1990 2019 representation of flows in fluviometric stations for this we compute the pearson correlation coefficient r and the root mean square error rmse between observed and simulated time series fig 3 a large body of studies assesses hydrological signatures to characterize streamflow time series and to predict some hydrological processes in ungauged catchments addor and melsen 2019 mcmillan et al 2017 2016 tyralis et al 2021 we compute nine hydrological signatures summarized in table 5 to assess model predictions some of the selected indices are hydrological signatures introduced by addor et al 2018 we choose the 5 flow quantile mean daily discharge 95 flow quantile baseflow index slope of the flow duration curve average duration of high flow events frequency of high flow events average duration of low flow events and frequency of low flow events we calculate model errors in four observed data coverage intervals 0 25 25 50 50 75 75 100 to compare predicted and observed signatures in different fluviometric stations across the country the median of errors was computed and standard error was calculated in each interval by dividing the standard deviation by the squared root of the sampling data error bars were built using the median values the standard error 3 results 3 1 selection of donor and receptor sub catchments the left side of fig 4 displays the spatial variability of four climatic p ta pet ai and three physiographic slo ftc clay characteristics high mean annual rates of p and pet can be found in the atlantic and titicaca slopes while the pacific coast is characterized by very high ai values with low p and high pet ta is lower over the andes and higher in the northeastern amazon basin and seems to be inversely related to slo values clay tends to be relatively homogeneous across the study domain with maximum values in the amazon basin ftc is also considerably higher in the atlantic divide than in the pacific and titicaca drainages overall 73 of total sub catchments are donors while the remaining 27 are receptors it means that just a few parts of national model parameters and streamflow simulation are generated by the hydrological regionalization procedure the pacific slope has the major percentage of receptor sub catchments per divide 38 followed by titicaca 29 and atlantic 16 slopes the colored areas on the right side of fig 4 correspond to 43 gauged catchments in the study domain the zoom in panel shows details of hydrological zones and sub zones for the central pacific slope in this case gauged catchments colored polygons were classified into one obr 1 two cho 1 and cho 2 or three sdo 1 sdo 2 sdo 3 clusters then model parameters are transferred from donors colored areas to receptors white areas at sub catchment level sub catchments labeled with the same station name e g cho belong to the same hydrological zone while the number next to the names distinguishes the sub zone e g cho 1 or cho 2 furthermore we identify a total of 43 hydrological zones and 122 sub zones 3 2 evaluation of the national model performance we conduct the daily national model for period 1981 2020 fig 5 depicts the spatial distribution of four metrics in terms of kge and nsesqrt fig 5a b the model performs well kge 0 75 and nsesqrt 0 65 during calibration and validation periods for stations located in the pacific titicaca and the andes amazon transition fluviometric stations in the amazon lowlands northeast present low performance 0 5 in both metrics we note that in this group of gauges kge and nsesqrt values slightly increase from calibration to validation period in terms of mare and pbias fig 5c d good model performance mare 1 and 25 pbias 25 can be found for both periods for most stations only two gauges present higher mare values 8 and for the pacific drainage negative values of pbias increase from calibration to validation overall for the total period the national hydrological model performs well with high kge and nsesqrt values for 71 and 68 of all stations respectively the spatial behavior of both indices shows better model performances in the pacific and titicaca drainages than in the atlantic slope low performance prevails in the amazon lowlands in this study high kge and nsesqrt values show a good representation of high middle and general flows respectively for most gauges mare is a good index for low data values considering that it is less sensitive to high flow values ferreira et al 2020 that means that 95 of stations with lower relative error values also confirm a good representation of low flows for total period the model performance shows lower negative pbias indicating a slight tendency for model overestimation table 4 except for the northern pacific coast where the model generally underestimates water discharges 3 3 cross validation in the pacific slope fig 6 displays results of the cross validation procedure in all gauged catchments for the pacific drainage panels present scatter plots between statistical metrics before and after cross validation green boxes denote areas with good model performance kge 0 50 nsesqrt 0 50 mare 1 and 25 pbias 25 in terms of kge most gauges located in the central and south pacific have good skills points inside the green box after loocv hence it seems that regionalization s procedure is still a challenge in northern catchments for high middle flows where model performance highly decreases in terms of nsesqrt general daily flows are good represented after transferring parameters but northern gauges present low performances nsesqrt 0 5 in the case of mare major points have values less than 1 following the same performance as individual model calibration finally gauges located in the south pacific present lower biases and we note that most catchments with negative biases in model calibration have positive biases after cross validation 3 4 national simulation of flow series fig 7 displays simulated and observed flow time series for the six gauges with the highest record length comparison between daily monthly seasonal and annual flow series show that model outputs are capable to reproduce streamflow behavior at different time scales simulations can represent the high variability of daily flows including daily peak flows seasonal streamflow variability is well represented in many cases with exception of sal station so wet december april and dry seasons june september are replicated by simulations model outputs perform well at annual scale and simulated interannual variability follows a similar pattern to observed values however some extreme years e g 1982 1983 and 1997 1998 are overestimated by the model the comparison between observed and simulated flow series in terms of r and rmse metrics for different time scales is shown in table 6 there are not seem to be a strong relationship between flow data coverage and r and rmse values for instance streamflow gauges with low record length e g cum 14 2 can get higher r values than those with more observed information e g psr 92 50 in many gauges simulations have a strong correlation r 0 75 with observed values at daily monthly and annual time scales rmse values are slightly heterogeneous in space higher model errors are present in gauges of the amazon lowlands e g tam 14710 2 mm year bel 974 91 mm year tab 737 95 mm year fig 8 depicts errors between predicted and observed signatures related to 5 flow quantile mean daily discharge 95 flow quantile baseflow index slope of the flow duration curve average duration of high flow events frequency of high flow events average duration of low flow events and frequency of low flow events points in magenta are median errors for each interval of data coverage while vertical bars correspond to standard error positive error values correspond to overestimation of predicted signatures while negative ones mean underestimation median values in flow magnitude signatures fig 8a c are the most positive and error bars increase from low 5 quantile to high 95 quantile flows error in baseflow index signature fig 8d is very low in all stations the median of slope of flow duration curves errors fig 8e is negative and decreases when record length grows median errors in duration and frequency of low and high flow events are positive fig 8f i errors in duration signatures tend to increase when data coverage grows while the inverse behavior occurs for frequency signatures fig 9 displays the qualitative classifications of national daily streamflow simulations in gauged catchments based on kge thiemig et al 2013 and nsesqrt moriasi et al 2015 ranges in terms of kge ratings fig 9a with emphasis on high middle flows mizukami et al 2019 simulations are good green areas in catchments of the south central south and northwest of the country ratings decrease in the central north intermediate blue areas and northeast poor yellow areas in terms of nsesqrt ratings fig 9b with emphasis on general flows chiew et al 1993 simulations with very good green areas and good blue areas and satisfactory yellow areas ratings cover the majority of catchments however unsatisfactory red areas simulations in the country s northeast correspond to the amazon lowlands this paper introduces a new hydrological dataset of simulated daily flow series in peru for 11913 river reaches this dataset named pisco hyd arnovic is available at https www hydroshare org

sonics 4 discussion 4 1 findings in the similarity based regionalization several procedures can be cited in the literature to perform stream flow prediction in an ungauged catchment as the spatial proximity method has the optimal performance in catchments with a high density of gauges parajka et al 2013 in data scarcity domains physical similarity approach shows higher performance than other methods wang et al 2021 so here we use a simple combination of both approaches section 2 3 to classify donor and receptor sub catchments the efficiency of regionalization is dependent on the regionalization method number of catchments and catchment area as regionalization performance tends to increase with an increasing number of sub catchments we use 12 thousand sub catchments across the study domain other studies have similarly found that the efficiency of regionalization increases significantly with increasing drainage area merz et al 2009 nester et al 2011 hence we do not consider drainage areas as regionalization descriptors because the small sub catchments sizes 120 km2 could increase hydrological variability across the country in that sense we choose only the best global runoff predictors proposed by beck et al 2020 2016 2015 and used in a global application of the vic rapid model lin et al 2019 the number of hydrological zones found here increased drastically compared with a previous regionalization study for the same domain llauca et al 2021b in this paper hydrological zones and sub zone boundaries are not continuous in space that means that sub catchments from the same zone and sub zone might not necessarily be proximal to neighbor catchments furthermore the similarity based regionalization approach is not restricted by gauges location as it is in a sensitivity analysis regionalization procedure bock et al 2016 these differences help us to increase catchment variability representation across the country 43 zones instead 14 presented in llauca et al 2021b especially in a context of limited or no access to in situ networks we select just the best parameter set with the least dissimilarity index in a 300 km searching radius due to computational limitations and the small number of ungauged sub catchments in the study domain 27 of the total area however this choice might increase regionalization uncertainties in ungauged catchments for instance beck et al 2015 proposed transferring parameters from the best ten donor candidates in our case cross validation results show heterogeneous regionalization performances using the only best donor in the pacific divide so findings suggest that increasing the number of donor candidates could improve results future studies will raise the number of candidate donors and assess the impact on regionalization performance 4 2 limitations of flow simulation at the national level quantifying flows in peru is a challenging task given the large physiographic zevallos and lavado casimiro 2022 climatic son et al 2020 and hydrological lavado casimiro et al 2012 heterogeneities across the territory there are few recent large scale hydrological modeling experiments in peru providing simulated water discharges most of these have focused only on specific divides for instance asurza véliz and lavado casimiro 2020 and rau et al 2019 conduct daily and monthly models respectively for the pacific drainage using regionalization techniques in a data scarce context zubieta et al 2021 and satgé et al 2019 assess climate change impacts and precipitation products in the lake titicaca catchment using grs conceptual models in the peruvian amazon basin local studies have performed hydrological models in the andes amazon transition baltazar et al 2023 chancay and espitia sarmiento 2021 while large sample hydrological applications have assessed the entire amazon basin using ghms for detecting peak flows towner et al 2019 and global datasets such as grace gravity satellites for runoff estimation chen et al 2020 in that sense the results present here build upon hydrological model simulations using the arno vic rapid modeling framework and pisco dataset set as forcing inputs showing a spatial performance variability similar to reported in those studies the meteorological data are the critical input for hydrological modeling singh and reza najafi 2020 depict that the propagation of gridded climate datasets biases has strong implications in the simulation of extreme events thus the unsatisfactory modeling results found in northeastern peru may reflect two main issues first the significant uncertainty of spatial rainfall distribution in the marañón ucayali and huallaga catchments reported by fernandez palomino et al 2021 and zubieta et al 2017 and second higher piscop unstable version uncertainties due to the lack of rainfall estimates in equatorial regions aybar et al 2020 furthermore as evapotranspiration plays a crucial role in hydrological processes in the amazon catchment de oliveira et al 2021 daily pet climatologies might be increasing forcing uncertainties and water balance in the amazon lowlands overall we demonstrate the feasibility to implement a sub catchment hybrid hydrological modeling framework arno vic rapid for generating flow simulations in peru similar to national hydrological applications in other study domains using physical based and conceptual models such as s hype girons lopez et al 2021 wep cn liu et al 2020 topnet mcmillan et al 2016 and hbv veijalainen et al 2010 in addition because large scale hydrological modeling is complex in data scarce sites the following assumptions might be impacts in model results a streamflow gauges with shorter records might influence model calibration due to insufficient information available for discharge uncertainty distribution estimation westerberg et al 2020 thus this work incorporate a flow data coverage assessment b we estimate naturalized river flows across the country even in the pacific divide which has the largest population and major infrastructure of water regulation stensrud 2019 c we conduct a mono objective function with emphasis on high middle flow calibration mizukami et al 2019 used in national water balance applications such as vásquez et al 2021 d due to floodplain playing an essential role in the amazon basin flow routing wongchuig correa et al 2017 uncertainties in channel geometry information could affect simulations in the atlantic drainage more than pacific and titicaca slopes 5 conclusions in this study a hybrid modeling framework and a similarity based regionalization approach were described for running a national hydrological model across an extensive river network the methodology proposed allows us to build daily simulations of flow series in the peruvian catchments the national hydrological model performance is good in most parts of the country and simulations follow observed daily flow series especially for catchments located on the pacific coast and in the andes amazon transition of peru moreover the model can represent streamflow seasonal and interannual variability and main hydrological signatures across the country low model performance was observed in northeastern peru amazon lowlands where simulations tend to overestimate the observed water discharges this might be related to forcing data uncertainties due to the low density of ground meteorological observations in the amazon basin and biases in operational gridded meteorological products also the limited number of fluviometric stations in the amazon slope could be increasing parameter states and outputs uncertainties due to error propagation from head basins to downstream in the andes amazon transition hydrological regionalization proved to be a useful tool to estimate daily streamflow series in ungauged catchments and to deal with the problem of data scarcity in peru future studies will incorporate different conceptual model structures and donor candidates ongoing research focuses on the implementation of a national hydrological model for peru the main application is the generation of a new operational hydrological dataset of daily flow series from 01 january 1981 to the present day this dataset will also be used to include future risk scenario simulations in often poorly gauged catchments climate change impacts on water resources and the implementation of climate services in peru such as the monitoring and forecasting of potential floods in the national service of

outcomes can provide valuable information for hydrologists and water resource managers in peruvian regions with limited or no access to in situ networks graphical abstract ga1 keywords peru hydrological regionalization national hydrological modeling pisco dataset data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrological models represent an important alternative to provide spatially continuous water discharge simulations across large scale domains zink et al 2017 and provide valuable information on hydrological risk even in areas with limited ground observation data llauca et al 2021a global hydrological models ghms have been used in a wide range of applications such as the global reconstruction of naturalized river flow lin et al 2019 flood forecasting lavers et al 2019 climate change assessment hattermann et al 2017 global water economy dolan et al 2021 and ecosystem services janse et al 2019 the implementation of ghms has increased significatively since the explosion of global data availability from satellites in the last decades tang et al 2009 sood and smakhtin 2015 suggest that ghms should not aim to replace more locally focused modeling efforts where finer spatial resolutions are needed in that sense national hydrological models nhms are becoming an increasingly popular tool for providing information not only in gauged locations but also all ungauged river reaches for instance nhms are currently applied for seasonal water forecasts in sweden girons lopez et al 2021 climate change impacts on peak river flows in great britain kay et al 2021 and assessing the risk of floods and droughts in new zealand mcmillan et al 2016 in peru the increasing hydrological risks huggel et al 2015 and water use put pressure on water resources drenkhan et al 2015 combined with the larger country size 1 285 220 km2 low density of fluviometric stations and short flow data records llauca et al 2021b have prompted hydrologists and decision makers to extend efforts for more systematic and nationwide water resource analyses national scale modeling requires dealing with its own challenges mcmillan et al 2016 mention that national model input data will depend on the country size climate variability and catchment characteristics in a data scarcity context many river reaches are poorly gauged or lack any observations and continuous flow data records are often economically and logistically unfeasible vereecken et al 2008 many of nhms applications use physically based and high resolution hydrological models e g wep cn vic mike she wrf hydro that require a large number of inputs at huge computational costs rodriguez and tomasella 2016 contrariwise some studies in peru lavado casimiro et al 2011 llauca et al 2021b saavedra et al 2021 have shown that conceptual hydrological models such as the framework for understanding structural errors clark et al 2008 and the génie rural rainfall runoff models mouelhi et al 2006 are also capable to adequately represent hydrological processes in catchments with different characteristic the application of conceptual rainfall runoff models in large scale domains needs to be linked to river routing models such as rapid david et al 2011b hyperstream piccolroaz et al 2016 mizuroute mizukami et al 2016 and others to simultaneously compute water discharges in thousands of river reaches as is shown in lin et al 2019 in that sense a hybrid modeling framework combining rainfall runoff and river routing models represents a low resource alternative for operational national daily streamflow simulation in data scarce countries such as peru parameter selection for a national model requires procedures that can be applied to many catchments and ungauged catchments the central premise is searching for similarities between catchments to identify homogeneous hydrological areas song and james 1992 a first way to deal with the extrapolation of hydrological information from a gauged catchment donor to an ungauged one receptor is by employing the spatial proximity criteria pagliero et al 2014 where model parameters are transferred from a neighbor gauged catchment recent studies have introduced other methods for hydrological regionalization in large scale hydrological models for instance beck et al 2020 use the dissimilarity concept for transferring model parameters from donor to receptor catchments in a global model narbondo et al 2020 apply a physical based approach using the richards baker flashiness index to predict runoff in ungauged catchments rau et al 2019 use the empirical relationship between geomorphological characteristics and conceptual model parameters pagliero et al 2019 incorporate a partial least squares regression and clustering analysis for hydrological regionalization kratzert et al 2019 apply the entity aware long short term memory ea lstm network for regional rainfall runoff modeling and bock et al 2016 use the sensitivity analysis of the rainfall runoff and runoff variability indices to identify national hydrological calibration zones this study aims to develop a national hydrological model to investigate the following research questions a how can similarity based regionalization help to implement hydrological models in a data scarce country b how can available national datasets be applied to simulate daily flow series in thousands of river reaches simultaneously c how does the national hydrological model perform in peruvian catchments with different characteristics for this purpose we use cluster and dissimilarity approaches to identify pairs of donor and receptor sub catchments across entire peru furthermore gridded meteorological datasets are used to drive a hybrid hydrological framework that combines a conceptual rainfall runoff model and a river routing model finally we introduced a new hydrological dataset of daily flow series in 11913 river reaches in peru this new dataset is helpful for short term flood risk scenario simulations and long term water resource planning as the outcomes can provide valuable information for hydrologists and water resource managers in peruvian regions with limited or no access to in situ networks 2 data and methods 2 1 study domain peru is located in northwest south america the andes mountain range creates a complex topography and determines hydroclimatic variability along three main drainages the pacific atlantic and titicaca fig 1 the peruvian national water agency reports that the pacific titicaca and amazon drainages represent respectively 21 7 3 8 and 74 5 of the peruvian territory however the accessibility of freshwater resources in peru is the converse of population density 88 of the population lives along the pacific coast around titicaca and in the andean zones of the amazon basin where only 2 of the freshwater resources are available lavado casimiro et al 2012 peruvian hydroclimatology is influenced by the disruption of the large scale circulation patterns caused by the andes cordillera the contrasting oceanic boundary conditions and the landmass distribution garreaud et al 2009 atmospheric moisture from the atlantic ascends the andean slope and leads to high orographic rainfall rates over the eastern divide amazon lavado casimiro et al 2011 contrary the weak rainfall along the pacific coast western divide is related to the large scale mid tropospheric subsidence over the southeastern subtropical pacific ocean enhanced by the coastal upwelling of cold water lavado casimiro et al 2012 rainfall is highly variable in both space and time arid conditions with low rainfall rates characterize coastal areas on the pacific slopes 150 mm year while semi arid conditions 400 mm year prevail in the western flanks of the andes rau et al 2019 the atlantic and titicaca divides are characterized by humid and semi arid conditions respectively with high rainfall rates over the eastern andean slopes 1100 mm year at the andes amazon transition 3200 mm year and in the amazon basin 2550 mm year aybar et al 2020 according to lavado casimiro 2013 the rivers in the pacific divide are characterized by steep slopes they are not very long and their rainfall and discharge peaks occur simultaneously the rivers in amazon divide are characterized by steep slopes in the andes and near zero slopes in the amazon lowlands the rainfall peaks occur two months before the discharge peaks in the amazon plains and simultaneously in the andes the titicaca endorheic drainage is characterized by mean slopes and because it is in the highlands the average response between rainfall and discharge peaks is one month the study domain includes transboundary catchments shared with ecuador colombia and brazil with an approximate total drainage area of 1 480 620 km2 fig 1 given that the success of a similarity based regionalization approach depends on the use of a large and highly diverse set of catchments beck et al 2020 the study domain was divided into 11 913 sub catchments with a mean size of 120 km2 following the same river network as the geoglows ecmwf streamflow services sanchez lozano et al 2021 this spatial discretization considers a unique river stream per sub catchment to compute water discharge all catchments in the study domain and its sub catchments were previously classified as gauged 73 and ungauged 27 considering the 43 fluviometric stations displayed in fig 1a 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 the pisco dataset the peruvian interpolated data of the senamhi s climatological and hydrological observations pisco is a hydrometeorological dataset developed for the peruvian territory including transboundary catchments it contains gridded sub products of precipitation p air temperature ta and potential evapotranspiration pet with a 0 1º spatial resolution at daily and monthly time steps recently llauca et al 2021b incorporated a new sub product of monthly streamflow simulations at the national level pisco hym gr2m in a vector river flowline format the pisco dataset has been widely used in recent studies to assess the hydrological processes in peruvian catchments asurza véliz and lavado casimiro 2020 fernandez palomino et al 2021 saavedra et al 2021 the piscop ta pet sub products are available from 1981 to 2016 stable versions however an unstable version only for piscop is available from 1981 to the present and it is daily updated for senamhi s operational purposes piscop aybar et al 2020 is generated by using geostatistical and deterministic methods that include three precipitation sources a the quality controlled national rain gauge dataset b radar gauge merged precipitation climatologies and c the climate hazards group infrared precipitation chirp estimates similarly piscota is obtained from a time series of maximum and minimum air temperature data b a soil temperature product from the modis sensor moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and c geographic predictors e g elevation longitude latitude and topographic dissection index piscopet is generated from the previous piscota data following the methodology proposed by hargreaves and samani 1985 the pisco dataset is freely available on the iri data library website http iridl ldeo columbia edu sources senamhi hsr pisco in this study and for operational purposes the mean areal values of p and pet were calculated for each sub catchment from 1 january 1981 31 march 2020 the piscop unstable version was selected to extend the data baseline beyond 2016 at the same time we used only daily climatological values of piscopet due to the lack of an unstable version similar to piscop 2 2 2 discharge data the observed daily flow series of 43 fluviometric stations were selected from the common period of 1 january 1981 31 march 2020 a total of 79 of the stations belong to the national service of meteorology and hydrology of peru senamhi https www gob pe senamhi precisely in the amazon region atlantic slope most of the stations are monitored by the senamhi and by the french institute for sustainable development ird in the framework of the hybam project https hybam obs mip fr the detail of selected stations is summarized in table 1 and their spatial distribution is shown in fig 1a the selection processes consider a daily flows series with quality control b fluviometric stations with at least 40 15 years of record length for period 1981 2020 c streamflow gauges with stage discharge rating curves with at least 10 streamflow measurements per year and distributed during dry and wet periods and d stations strategically located in river streams with major drainage areas that are used for hydrologic calibration in strategic gauges with record lengths less than 40 mal poc pcq lna cum lag lpa pau and pcu a continuous 4 year record period within 1981 2020 was required to be considered for hydrologic model calibration 2 3 similarity based regionalization approach 2 3 1 predictor maps we used an a priori defined similarity criterion incorporating four climatic p precipitation ta air temperature pet potential evapotranspiration ai aridity index and three physiographic slo surface slope clay soil clay content ftc fraction of tree cover characteristics which can be found in table 2 according to beck et al 2015 and barbarossa et al 2018 these characteristics are strongly related to streamflow signatures in this study drainage area was not considered due to the high level of catchment discretization for semi distributed modeling and with sub catchments of similar sizes near 120 km2 also the snow cover fraction was not taken into account as a predictor due to most peruvian catchments being dominated by pluvial contribution aybar et al 2020 fernandez palomino et al 2021 maps of mean annual p ta and pet values were calculated for the period 1981 2010 ai was calculated from p and pet in case of ftc slo and clay mean annual maps were computed from available data during 1981 2010 finally the mean areal values of each predictor were calculated for all sub catchments gauged and ungauged across the study domain 2 3 2 cluster analysis and dissimilarity assessment hydrological models often rely on regionalization approaches to transfer information from gauged donor to ungauged receptor catchments according to beck et al 2016 2020 benefits of the similarity based approach include a its relative ease of implementation b retainment of model parameter interaction because the entire parameter set is transferred and c the possibility of spatial variability in model parameters according to landscape characteristics even in ungauged regions this work uses a similarity based approach fig 2 since a previous study has found it outperformed well in the pacific slope asurza véliz and lavado casimiro 2020 showing that it is possible to transfer calibrated parameter sets based on explicit consideration of climatic and physiographic similarity before pairing donor receptor sub catchments we apply a gauged sub catchment classification procedure as the main idea was to obtain more than one set of model parameters per catchment during model calibration and increase the number of donor candidates during parameter transfer the final number of parameter sets by each gauged calibrated catchment will be equal to clusters in it for this we conduct a hierarchical cluster analysis using the predictor maps as descriptors to avoid increasing parameter uncertainties during calibration we adopted a maximum number of clusters per catchment of three seven climatic and physiographic descriptors at the sub catchment level were computed from predictor maps see table 2 the dissimilarity between donors and receptors was computed using the following equation proposed by beck et al 2016 1 s i j p 1 7 z p i z p j iqr p where s is the dissimilarity z are the values of the respective descriptor p denotes the descriptor and i and j mean respectively the donor and the receptor sub catchment in question iqr is the interquartile range of the descriptor and represents the spatial variability in all descriptor the division by iqr in equation 1 was necessary to equalize the data variability of descriptors from equation 1 it follows that a similar sub catchment yields an s value close to zero then dissimilarity values compose a distance matrix 3367 receptors x 8546 donors which characterizes the variability of the sub catchments in the region of interest we also incorporate the spatial proximity criterion selecting the most similar donor with the lowest s value from no more than 300 km distance this was considered to avoid sub catchment donors from too long distances and different drainage regions 2 4 national hydrological modeling 2 4 1 hybrid modeling framework we conduct a hybrid framework to develop the sub catchment national hydrological model fig 2 first meteorological data p and pet is used to drive a conceptual rainfall runoff model which estimates runoff volumes ru at each sub catchment then rainfall runoff outputs are inputs for a river routing modeling to generate daily streamflow q across the river network details of both models are described as follows 2 4 1 1 rainfall runoff model the variable infiltration capacity arno vic model liang et al 1994 todini 1996 was selected because of its flexibility and computational efficiency despite several simplifications the model is designed to provide a relatively complete representation of the dominant hydrologic fluxes addor and melsen 2019 lane et al 2019 here we select de arno vic model incorporated in the framework for understanding structural errors fuse developed by clark et al 2008 using the fuse r package vitolo et al 2016 the fuse framework has 79 unique model structures by combining components of existing hydrological models the arno vic structure has a single state variable for the upper soil layer s1 the lower soil layer s2 can be defined by a single nonlinear baseflow reservoir of fixed size evaporation e is modeled in both soil layers and computed based on the relative root fractions in each soil layer percolation q12 takes available water from wilting point θwilt to saturation θwilt the surface runoff qsx is conceptualized using the arno vic parameterization upper zone control and a gamma distribution is used for the time delay runoff readers can find more details about the model equations in clark et al 2008 2 4 1 2 river routing model the routing application for parallel computation of discharge rapid which uses a matrix based version of the muskingum routing scheme was applied to compute water discharge in thousands of river reaches simultaneously david et al 2011b rapid is an open source model available at https github com c h david rapid david et al 2011a follum et al 2017 lin et al 2015 salas et al 2018 tavakoly et al 2017 the muskingum method can be rearranged by introducing a transboundary matrix t i c 1 n as described by david et al 2015 in the rapid model 2 i c 1 n t q t t b t t c 1 q t t where t is time δt is the river routing time step i is the identity matrix n is the river network matrix q is a vector of outflows from each reach and c 1 is a diagonal parameter matrix for a given reach j we use the connectivity information from the geoglows ecmwf streamflow services sanchez lozano et al 2021 to create the network connectivity matrix n sub catchment runoff is connected to the routing scheme at the upstream node of each river reach and flow output from the model represents flow at the downstream node table 3 2 4 2 model calibration and validation we first execute the hybrid framework only for gauged sub catchments to find optimal model parameters the model was calibrated and validated for the period with simultaneously observed streamflow and input data we choose 60 of available records for calibration and 40 for validation periods the calibration strategy was the same as that used by llauca et al 2021b we consider a unique calibration step for the pacific and titicaca drainages and a stepwise calibration approach seven steps for the atlantic slope due to the number of fluviometric stations and complexity of river network on the amazon basin the shuffled complex evolutionary sce ua algorithm duan et al 1993 was applied to optimize the model parameters an artificial year 1980 of a warm up period was used before computing performance metrics this year was created using p and pet daily climatologies to avoid discarding model simulations since 1 january 1981 the kling gupta efficiency kge criterion gupta et al 2009 evaluated over daily streamflow time series was used as objective function streamflow simulations were also assessed through the nash sutcliffe squared efficiency nsesqrt criterion chiew et al 1993 the mean absolute relative error mare and the percent bias bias to take into account different hydrograph aspects the same selected statistical metrics summarized in table 4 were computed for calibration validation and the total simulation period 2 4 3 leave one out cross validation the similarity based hydrological regionalization approach is used in this study to transfer model parameters from gauged to ungauged catchments thus the uncertainties surrounding the regionalization procedure should be evaluated by applying a cross validation procedure to assess the regionalization skill wang et al 2021 leave one out cross validation loocv was conducted to assess the quality of transferring parameters for this each catchment is in turn considered as pseudo ungauged while the regionalization approach is applied to estimate its flows parajka et al 2005 then the remainder gauged catchments are candidates of donors and regionalization procedure was applied to transfer model parameters from the catchments with the least dissimilarity index finally the simulated streamflow at the pseudo ungauged catchment is then compared with observation and statistical metrics kge nsesqrt mare and bias are computed loocv was only applied to 15 catchments in the pacific drainage see table 1 and statistical metrics obtained with loocv was compared with the independent model calibration for total period 2 4 4 streamflow simulation across the country first we transfer optimal parameters from donor to receptor sub catchments considering a unique set of model parameters for each hydrological sub zone then a new model run was computed for all catchments and the respective gauged and ungauged sub catchments to simulate daily flow series 1981 2020 across the national river network fig 2 also monthly and yearly flow series were computed to assess the seasonal september august and interannual 1990 2019 representation of flows in fluviometric stations for this we compute the pearson correlation coefficient r and the root mean square error rmse between observed and simulated time series fig 3 a large body of studies assesses hydrological signatures to characterize streamflow time series and to predict some hydrological processes in ungauged catchments addor and melsen 2019 mcmillan et al 2017 2016 tyralis et al 2021 we compute nine hydrological signatures summarized in table 5 to assess model predictions some of the selected indices are hydrological signatures introduced by addor et al 2018 we choose the 5 flow quantile mean daily discharge 95 flow quantile baseflow index slope of the flow duration curve average duration of high flow events frequency of high flow events average duration of low flow events and frequency of low flow events we calculate model errors in four observed data coverage intervals 0 25 25 50 50 75 75 100 to compare predicted and observed signatures in different fluviometric stations across the country the median of errors was computed and standard error was calculated in each interval by dividing the standard deviation by the squared root of the sampling data error bars were built using the median values the standard error 3 results 3 1 selection of donor and receptor sub catchments the left side of fig 4 displays the spatial variability of four climatic p ta pet ai and three physiographic slo ftc clay characteristics high mean annual rates of p and pet can be found in the atlantic and titicaca slopes while the pacific coast is characterized by very high ai values with low p and high pet ta is lower over the andes and higher in the northeastern amazon basin and seems to be inversely related to slo values clay tends to be relatively homogeneous across the study domain with maximum values in the amazon basin ftc is also considerably higher in the atlantic divide than in the pacific and titicaca drainages overall 73 of total sub catchments are donors while the remaining 27 are receptors it means that just a few parts of national model parameters and streamflow simulation are generated by the hydrological regionalization procedure the pacific slope has the major percentage of receptor sub catchments per divide 38 followed by titicaca 29 and atlantic 16 slopes the colored areas on the right side of fig 4 correspond to 43 gauged catchments in the study domain the zoom in panel shows details of hydrological zones and sub zones for the central pacific slope in this case gauged catchments colored polygons were classified into one obr 1 two cho 1 and cho 2 or three sdo 1 sdo 2 sdo 3 clusters then model parameters are transferred from donors colored areas to receptors white areas at sub catchment level sub catchments labeled with the same station name e g cho belong to the same hydrological zone while the number next to the names distinguishes the sub zone e g cho 1 or cho 2 furthermore we identify a total of 43 hydrological zones and 122 sub zones 3 2 evaluation of the national model performance we conduct the daily national model for period 1981 2020 fig 5 depicts the spatial distribution of four metrics in terms of kge and nsesqrt fig 5a b the model performs well kge 0 75 and nsesqrt 0 65 during calibration and validation periods for stations located in the pacific titicaca and the andes amazon transition fluviometric stations in the amazon lowlands northeast present low performance 0 5 in both metrics we note that in this group of gauges kge and nsesqrt values slightly increase from calibration to validation period in terms of mare and pbias fig 5c d good model performance mare 1 and 25 pbias 25 can be found for both periods for most stations only two gauges present higher mare values 8 and for the pacific drainage negative values of pbias increase from calibration to validation overall for the total period the national hydrological model performs well with high kge and nsesqrt values for 71 and 68 of all stations respectively the spatial behavior of both indices shows better model performances in the pacific and titicaca drainages than in the atlantic slope low performance prevails in the amazon lowlands in this study high kge and nsesqrt values show a good representation of high middle and general flows respectively for most gauges mare is a good index for low data values considering that it is less sensitive to high flow values ferreira et al 2020 that means that 95 of stations with lower relative error values also confirm a good representation of low flows for total period the model performance shows lower negative pbias indicating a slight tendency for model overestimation table 4 except for the northern pacific coast where the model generally underestimates water discharges 3 3 cross validation in the pacific slope fig 6 displays results of the cross validation procedure in all gauged catchments for the pacific drainage panels present scatter plots between statistical metrics before and after cross validation green boxes denote areas with good model performance kge 0 50 nsesqrt 0 50 mare 1 and 25 pbias 25 in terms of kge most gauges located in the central and south pacific have good skills points inside the green box after loocv hence it seems that regionalization s procedure is still a challenge in northern catchments for high middle flows where model performance highly decreases in terms of nsesqrt general daily flows are good represented after transferring parameters but northern gauges present low performances nsesqrt 0 5 in the case of mare major points have values less than 1 following the same performance as individual model calibration finally gauges located in the south pacific present lower biases and we note that most catchments with negative biases in model calibration have positive biases after cross validation 3 4 national simulation of flow series fig 7 displays simulated and observed flow time series for the six gauges with the highest record length comparison between daily monthly seasonal and annual flow series show that model outputs are capable to reproduce streamflow behavior at different time scales simulations can represent the high variability of daily flows including daily peak flows seasonal streamflow variability is well represented in many cases with exception of sal station so wet december april and dry seasons june september are replicated by simulations model outputs perform well at annual scale and simulated interannual variability follows a similar pattern to observed values however some extreme years e g 1982 1983 and 1997 1998 are

green areas and good blue areas and satisfactory yellow areas ratings cover the majority of catchments however unsatisfactory red areas simulations in the country s northeast correspond to the amazon

sonics 4 discussion 4 1 findings in the similarity based regionalization several procedures can be cited in the literature to perform stream flow prediction in an ungauged catchment as the spatial proximity method has the optimal performance in catchments with a high density of gauges parajka et al 2013 in data scarcity domains physical similarity approach shows higher performance than other methods wang et al 2021 so here we use a simple combination of both approaches section 2 3 to classify donor and receptor sub catchments the efficiency of regionalization is dependent on the regionalization method number of catchments and catchment area as regionalization performance tends to increase with an increasing number of sub catchments we use 12 thousand sub catchments across the study domain other studies have similarly found that the efficiency of regionalization increases significantly with increasing drainage area merz et al 2009 nester et al 2011 hence we do not consider drainage areas as regionalization descriptors because the small sub catchments sizes 120 km2 could increase hydrological variability across the country in that sense we choose only the best global runoff predictors proposed by beck et al 2020 2016 2015 and used in a global application of the vic rapid model lin et al 2019 the number of hydrological zones found here increased drastically compared with a previous regionalization study for the same domain llauca et al 2021b in this paper hydrological zones and sub zone boundaries are not continuous in space that means that sub catchments from the same zone and sub zone might not necessarily be proximal to neighbor catchments furthermore the similarity based regionalization approach is not restricted by gauges location as it is in a sensitivity analysis regionalization procedure bock et al 2016 these differences help us to increase catchment variability representation across the country 43 zones instead 14 presented in llauca et al 2021b especially in a context of limited or no access to in situ networks we select just the best parameter set with the least dissimilarity index in a 300 km searching radius due to computational limitations and the small number of ungauged sub catchments in the study domain 27 of the total area however this choice might increase regionalization uncertainties in ungauged catchments for instance beck et al 2015 proposed transferring parameters from the best ten donor candidates in our case cross validation results show heterogeneous regionalization performances using the only best donor in the pacific divide so findings suggest that increasing the number of donor candidates could improve results future studies will raise the number of candidate donors and assess the impact on regionalization performance 4 2 limitations of flow simulation at the national level quantifying flows in peru is a challenging task given the large physiographic zevallos and lavado casimiro 2022 climatic son et al 2020 and hydrological lavado casimiro et al 2012 heterogeneities across the territory there are few recent large scale hydrological modeling experiments in peru providing simulated water discharges most of these have focused only on specific divides for instance asurza véliz and lavado casimiro 2020 and rau et al 2019 conduct daily and monthly models respectively for the pacific drainage using regionalization techniques in a data scarce context zubieta et al 2021 and satgé et al 2019 assess climate change impacts and precipitation products in the lake titicaca catchment using grs conceptual models in the peruvian amazon basin local studies have performed hydrological models in the andes amazon transition baltazar et al 2023 chancay and espitia sarmiento 2021 while large sample hydrological applications have assessed the entire amazon basin using ghms for detecting peak flows towner et al 2019 and global datasets such as grace gravity satellites for runoff estimation chen et al 2020 in that sense the results present here build upon hydrological model simulations using the arno vic rapid modeling framework and pisco dataset set as forcing inputs showing a spatial performance variability similar to reported in those studies the meteorological data are the critical input for hydrological modeling singh and reza najafi 2020 depict that the propagation of gridded climate datasets biases has strong implications in the simulation of extreme events thus the unsatisfactory modeling results found in northeastern peru may reflect two main issues first the significant uncertainty of spatial rainfall distribution in the marañón ucayali and huallaga catchments reported by fernandez palomino et al 2021 and zubieta et al 2017 and second higher piscop unstable version uncertainties due to the lack of rainfall estimates in equatorial regions aybar et al 2020 furthermore as evapotranspiration plays a crucial role in hydrological processes in the amazon catchment de oliveira et al 2021 daily pet climatologies might be increasing forcing uncertainties and water balance in the amazon lowlands overall we demonstrate the feasibility to implement a sub catchment hybrid hydrological modeling framework arno vic rapid for generating flow simulations in peru similar to national hydrological applications in other study domains using physical based and conceptual models such as s hype girons lopez et al 2021 wep cn liu et al 2020 topnet mcmillan et al 2016 and hbv veijalainen et al 2010 in addition because large scale hydrological modeling is complex in data scarce sites the following assumptions might be impacts in model results a streamflow gauges with shorter records might influence model calibration due to insufficient information available for discharge uncertainty distribution estimation westerberg et al 2020 thus this work incorporate a flow data coverage assessment b we estimate naturalized river flows across the country even in the pacific divide which has the largest population and major infrastructure of water regulation stensrud 2019 c we conduct a mono objective function with emphasis on high middle flow calibration mizukami et al 2019 used in national water balance applications such as vásquez et al 2021 d due to floodplain playing an essential role in the amazon basin flow routing wongchuig correa et al 2017 uncertainties in channel geometry information could affect simulations in the atlantic drainage more than pacific and titicaca slopes 5 conclusions in this study a hybrid modeling framework and a similarity based regionalization approach were described for running a national hydrological model across an extensive river network the methodology proposed allows us to build daily simulations of flow series in the peruvian catchments the national hydrological model performance is good in most parts of the country and simulations follow observed daily flow series especially for catchments located on the pacific coast and in the andes amazon transition of peru moreover the model can represent streamflow seasonal and interannual variability and main hydrological signatures across the country low model performance was observed in northeastern peru amazon lowlands where simulations tend to overestimate the observed water discharges this might be related to forcing data uncertainties due to the low density of ground meteorological observations in the amazon basin and biases in operational gridded meteorological products also the limited number of fluviometric stations in the amazon slope could be increasing parameter states and outputs uncertainties due to error propagation from head basins to downstream in the andes amazon transition hydrological regionalization proved to be a useful tool to estimate daily streamflow series in ungauged catchments and to deal with the problem of data scarcity in peru future studies will incorporate different conceptual model structures and donor candidates ongoing research focuses on the implementation of a national hydrological model for peru the main application is the generation of a new operational hydrological dataset of daily flow series from 01 january 1981 to the present day this dataset will also be used to include future risk scenario simulations in often poorly gauged catchments climate change impacts on water resources and the implementation of climate services in peru such as the monitoring and forecasting of potential floods in the national service of

7643,study region the susquehanna and upper susquehanna watersheds in the northeastern of the united states of america usa study focus this study explored the utility of the soil moisture active passive smap soil moisture downscaled to a range of spatial resolutions for improving ensemble streamflow simulations the smap level 3 soil moisture product with spatial resolution of roughly 40 km was downscaled to a range of spatial resolutions including 1 3 and 9 km over the susquehanna and upper susquehanna watersheds a set of experiments was conducted through direct insertion of the downscaled smap soil moisture into a physically based distributed hydrological model new hydrological insights for the region the updating of the model with the original and downscaled smap surface soil moisture markedly improved the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations with the crpss and nrmse values in the range of 0 10 0 17 and 0 79 0 85 respectively when compared to the non updated model for the susquehanna watershed in addition the ensemble spread was reduced and the ensemble mean compares well with the observed streamflow the 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture showed the highest accuracy in improving streamflow simulation with the crpss and nrmse value of 0 21 and 0 72 respectively for the upper susquehanna watershed whereas for the susquehanna watershed downscaled smap at 9 km adequately improved the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations with the crpss and nrmse value of 0 17 and 0 80 respectively besides the top layer of the model updating the second layer of the model with the vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture only slightly further improved the accuracy of the model graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil moisture smap downscaling updating improving streamflow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture plays an essential role in the runoff generation as it controls the partitioning of incoming precipitation into surface runoff and infiltration this is particularly important in the case of the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism dunne et al 1975 where the magnitude of the flood is determined by the pre storm soil moisture state of the watershed soil moisture also plays an important role in the partitioning of incoming net radiative energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes which in turn control near surface variables such as temperature and humidity entekhabi 1995 moreover a host of hydrometeorological and agricultural applications including hydrological forecasting weather forecasting and irrigation planning is heavily dependent on soil moisture state conventionally in situ measurements are used to characterize the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture they provide the most accurate and reliable soil moisture information but with low spatial representativeness dobriyal et al 2012 besides they are time consuming and costly to establish their network over a larger area alternatively satellite passive microwave remote sensing notably at l band frequency 1 4 ghz offers the potential to map near surface soil moisture approximately at 5 cm depth at a global scale with decent temporal resolution i e 2 3 days entekhabi et al 2008 njoku and entekhabi 1996 indeed the l band passive microwave satellites are widely recognized as a superior alternative for soil moisture retrieval because of their strong sensitivity to soil moisture dynamics and capability to penetrate through cloud and vegetation canopy jackson and schmugge 1991 schmugge et al 1986 typical examples are soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 and soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2008 the smos is the first ever l band passive microwave mission dedicated to monitoring soil moisture and sea surface salinity at a global scale it was launched by the european space agency esa in 2009 and provides a global map of near surface soil moisture every 2 3 days with resolution of about 40 km kerr et al 2001 similarly the national aeronautics and space administration nasa launched the smap on january 31 2015 which carries both l band radar and radiometer sharing a single platform but the radar ceased operation on july 7 2015 colliander et al 2017 currently only the radiometer component continues the generation of soil moisture maps at roughly 40 km spatial resolution every 2 3 days however despite their well established methods for mapping near surface soil moisture the spatial resolution of smos and smap is coarse on the other hand there has been a growing interest over the last decades in the incorporation of passive microwave soil moisture products e g smos and smap into hydrological models for improving streamflow simulation and forecasting brocca et al 2011 peng et al 2021 reichle 2008 this is mainly because of the increased availability of spatially distributed soil moisture observations from the passive microwave remote sensing and the key role that soil moisture plays as the main state variable of hydrological models however as stated before the spatial resolution of passive microwave soil moisture products is generally coarse i e 25 50 km indeed this resolution deemed sufficient for continental and global scale hydrometeorological applications but a host of hydrometeorological and agricultural applications at local and regional scales require soil moisture information at high spatial resolution i e a kilometer or less thus the scale disparity between the resolution of satellite soil moisture products and hydrological applications requirement should be reduced one possible approach to reduce this disparity and enhance spatial resolution of passive microwave soil moisture products is through spatial downscaling sabaghy et al 2017 many previous studies have used different spatial downscaling methods such as those based on the universal triangle concept or machine learning among many others liu et al 2020 peng et al 2017 sabaghy et al 2018 to downscale the coarse resolution passive microwave soil moisture products however majority of these studies have downscaled passive microwave soil moisture products with the objective to reduce the spatial scale disparity between the satellite soil moisture products i e 25 50 km and in situ soil moisture measurements i e in the order of few centimeters often for the purpose of validation of satellite soil moisture products for example zhao et al 2018 abbaszadeh et al 2019 and wakigari and leconte 2022 downscaled the smap soil moisture from 36 to 1 km over iberian peninsula continental united states conus and susquehanna river basin respectively and validated with in situ soil moisture measurements likewise djamai et al 2015 piles and sánchez 2016 and zheng et al 2021 downscaled the smos soil moisture to 1 km over the canadian prairies murrumbidgee watershed australia and huai river basin china respectively and validated with in situ soil moisture measurements these studies have not extended the downscaled product for hydrological applications on the other hand there are only few studies which have downscaled passive microwave soil moisture products with the objective to use for local scale hydrological applications abbaszadeh et al 2020 le et al 2022 lópez lópez et al 2016 for example abbaszadeh et al 2020 downscaled the smap soil moisture from 36 to 1 km and assimilated into wrf hydro model using the particle filter pf for the watershed located in the southeastern part of texas united states with warm and humid climate and moderately dense vegetation similarly le et al 2022 assimilated 1 km downscaled smap into swat model using the ensemble kalman filter enkf for eight watersheds located across tropical vietnam with area ranging from 267 to 6340 km2 three of the watersheds are dominated by forest land cover and the remaining five are dominated by shrubland and cropland in addition lópez lópez et al 2016 assimilated the 9 km downscaled soil moisture derived from amsr e into two distributed hydrological models i e the local openstreams wflow sbm and the global pcr globwb for murrumbidgee river basin australia which is a dry watershed with sparse vegetation overall these studies have found improvement in streamflow simulation due to the assimilation of downscaled soil moisture products alternatively there are many studies which have assimilated the original resolution i e 25 50 km passive microwave soil moisture products derived from different satellites without downscaling for local and regional scale hydrological applications jadidoleslam et al 2021 kumar et al 2014 lievens et al 2015 for example jadidoleslam et al 2021 found significant improvement in streamflow simulation after assimilation of the coarse spatial resolution smos and smap soil moisture into a distributed hydrological model using ensemble kalman filter enkf for 131 united states geological survey s usgs gauges in heavily agricultural region of iowa state united states conversely kumar et al 2014 assimilated amsr e soil moisture retrievals into noah land surface model using enkf for 572 small watersheds with area ranging between 645 and 10 000 km2 and 19 large watersheds with area ranging between 19 036 and 682 465 km2 across the conus they reported minor improvement in streamflow simulation across most watersheds lievens et al 2015 found improvement only in peak flows after assimilation of smos soil moisture using enkf into the variable infiltration capacity vic model their study was conducted on murray darling basin australia with an approximate area of 1 million km2 this basin is dominated by grassland 26 shrubs 23 deciduous broadleaf trees 21 and crops 9 and it is characterized by semi arid climate on the other hand parajka et al 2006 reported no improvement at all in streamflow simulation after assimilation of ers scatterometer soil moisture it is worth noting that the assimilation of coarse spatial resolution passive microwave soil moisture products resulted in contrasting results indeed while some studies have found significant improvement in simulation and forecasting of the streamflow brocca et al 2012 massari et al 2015 wanders et al 2014 a considerable number of other studies have reported no to little benefit of satellite soil moisture in improving the streamflow simulation and forecasting alvarez garreton et al 2014 kumar et al 2014 parajka et al 2006 overall the lack of consensus among these studies on whether the incorporation of remotely sensed soil moisture into models improves the accuracy of streamflow simulation and flood forecasting or not might be explained by 1 the difference in models used e g lumped semi distributed or physically based fully distributed models 2 assimilation techniques used i e direct insertion enkf or particle filter 3 watershed characteristics e g location size land cover soil type and dominant hydrological processes and 4 characteristics of the assimilated remotely sensed soil moisture products e g retrieval algorithm accuracy and quality penetration depth spatial support and temporal availability mao et al 2019 moreover as remotely sensed soil moisture represents only the upper few centimeters of the soil the degree of its coupling with subsurface soil moisture could also determine the accuracy of hydrological model prediction capehart and carlson 1997 chen et al 2011 overall the contrasting results reported by previous studies after assimilation of coarse spatial resolution passive microwave soil moisture highlight the importance of further exploring its utility in improving the accuracy streamflow simulation in addition a point worth noting is that only few previous studies have considered assimilation of downscaled passive microwave soil moisture and these studies have tended to focus on assimilation passive microwave soil moisture downscaled to 1 km resolution only however the impact of spatial resolutions of downscaled passive microwave soil moisture products to range of spatial resolutions e g 1 3 and 9 km on the accuracy of model streamflow simulation in relation to watershed size and frequency of updating needs further investigation thus distinctively from previous studies the objective of this study is to evaluate the utility of the original i e 36 km and downscaled passive microwave soil moisture products to a range of spatial resolutions i e 1 3 and 9 km in improving streamflow simulation for two contrasting watersheds mainly in terms of size 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the susquehanna watershed and its head sub watershed i e the upper susquehanna are located in the northeastern part of the united states covering half the land area of pennsylvania and parts of new york and maryland states ray et al 2016 both are characterized by humid continental mild summer with wet all year climate dfb class according to köppen trewartha climate classification belda et al 2014 the susquehanna watershed has a drainage area of 71 255 km2 the susquehanna river exits from otsego lake in cooperstown new york and travels about 715 km to chesapeake bay its average annual precipitation varies between 800 and 1250 mm whereas the mean annual temperature for the northern and the southern portion of the watershed is 6 and 12 oc respectively dephilip and moberg 2010 the dominant land cover is forest 55 followed by agriculture and pasture 33 peak streamflow occurs during the spring season because of the collective effect of snowmelt and rainfall whereas low flow is usually experienced in late summer and early fall its elevation varies between 4 and 1150 m on the other hand the upper susquehanna watershed has a drainage area of 21 000 km2 and located in south central of new york and north of pennsylvania states dephilip and moberg 2010 it is characterized by a mixture of forest and farmland its average annual precipitation varies between 890 and 1270 mm whereas the mean annual temperature for the northern and the southern portion of the watershed varies between 5 and 10 5 oc respectively maloney et al 2018 its peak and low streamflow occur during spring and late summer respectively its elevation varies between 150 and 800 m 2 2 description of data 2 2 1 the smap soil moisture products the smap level 3 soil moisture product l3smp version 7 with spatial resolution of 36 km was downloaded from the nasa national snow and ice data center distributed active archive center nsidc daac https nsidc org data smap accessed date 20 may 2021 in addition the downscaled smap to range of spatial resolutions including 1 3 and 9 km was used for downscaling we trained random forest machine learning technique using a range of predictors which have strong association with soil moisture such as land surface temperature lst normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and albedo derived from modis in addition topographic derivatives such as elevation slope and aspect were used the smap soil moisture was used as response variable and the training was carried out at resolution of smap i e 36 km the high resolution predictors were aggregated to this resolution during the training finally after verification of the model at coarse spatial resolution it was applied to the high resolution predictors to predict soil moisture at higher spatial resolutions hence for this study we downscaled the smap soil moisture from 36 km to 1 3 and 9 km in a nut shell the random forest machine learning technique used in here is a non parametric decision tree based ensemble learning breiman 2001 it has a great capability to represent the complex relationship between soil moisture and geophysical and atmospheric factors which have a strong association with soil moisture it is mainly based on bootstrap sampling bagging to randomly resample the training dataset into a set of subsamples with replacement each sample is then used to independently train each decision tree and the final anticipated value is obtained as an average of prediction of all decision trees for further details about our downscaling approach the reader can refer to our recent publication wakigari and leconte 2022 in this study the smap l3 soil moisture was selected based on our preliminary analysis by comparing the smap and smos soil moisture against in situ soil moisture as reference the smos tends to overestimate soil moisture over our study area in addition previous global validation studies have indicated the outperformance of the smap over our study region compared to smos amsr e and ascat soil moisture kim et al 2018 kumar et al 2018 ma et al 2019 moreover the original and downscaled smap soil moisture was validated with the existing in situ soil moisture and precipitation measurements in the susquehanna watershed however it is worth to note that the number of in situ soil moisture measurements are scarce in the susquehanna watershed fig 1 2 2 2 topography and land cover data topographic attributes such as elevation were extracted from nasa shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm dem it has 30 m spatial resolution and downloaded from the land processes distributed active archive center https lpdaac usgs gov accessed date 30 may 2021 similarly the latest version i e collection 6 of modis land cover mcd12q1 data for the year 2018 was used it has a resolution of 500 m and downloaded from the land processes distributed active archive center https lpdaac usgs gov accessed date 25 may 2021 2 2 3 hydrometeorological data daily surface precipitation and temperature i e maximum and minimum were collected from prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model daly et al 2008 which is a gridded dataset with a 4 4 km grid resolution produced from a set of in situ measurements across conus using terrain aware interpolation techniques it was developed by the prism climate group at oregon state university http www prism oregonstate edu the streamflow observations with daily temporal resolution were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs at gauge stations located at towanda 1 531 500 for the upper susquehanna watershed and harrisburg 1 570 500 for susquehanna watershed 2 2 4 ensemble meteorological data the ensemble of daily precipitation and temperature data was obtained from the ensemble meteorological dataset for planet earth em earth which is downloaded from federated research data repository frdr of canada https www frdr dfdr ca repo it is a recently developed global dataset consists of deterministic and probabilistic estimates of daily precipitation mean and range of daily temperature for historical period of 1950 2019 tang et al 2022 it has a spatial resolution of roughly 10 km em earth was produced following two sequential steps first the em earth deterministic estimate was produced by merging station based serially complete dataset with era 5 reanalysis and second the ensemble members were generated from merged data using spatiotemporally correlated random fields for further technical details about this data is available in tang et al 2022 in this study precipitation and maximum minimum temperature with an ensemble size of 25 members were used to drive a distributed hydrological model as em earth did not provide the maximum and minimum temperature they were estimated from the mean and range of daily temperature characteristics of all the data used are summarized in table 1 in the table the model setup refers feeding the model with all the necessary inputs including precipitation and temperature data stated in the table 1 followed by its calibration and validation with streamflow observation on the other hand ensemble simulations refers updating the calibrated and validated model with the smap soil moisture while forcing with ensemble precipitation and temperature 2 3 hydrological model description a continuous and physically based distributed hydrological model called hydrotel fortin et al 2001 was employed it is developed at institut national de la recherche scientifique inrs in quebec canada with aim of making good use of gis and to capitalize on remotely sensed data for simulation of hydrological processes fortin et al 2001 in watersheds with a variety of physiographic and hydroclimatic characteristics it is operationally in use at the quebec hydrological expertise centre a government organization which produces river forecasts in hydrotel the watershed is spatially discretized into relatively homogeneous hydrological units rhhu using physitel which is a gis framework specifically developed for hydrotel to spatially discretize the watershed based on river networks elevation land cover and soil types accordingly in this study the susquehanna watershed was discretized into 1025 rhhus the area of rhhus ranges between 0 5 and 450 km2 with an average area of 70 km2 about 59 rhhus have an area greater than 100 km2 whereas 41 of them have an area less than 100 km2 this model has six major modules and each one of them has several options of simulation with a range of complexity and data requirement table 2 soil moisture module i e the vertical water balance module is briefly described herein as this study focused on the integration of the smap soil moisture into the model an extensive description of the remaining modules can be found in fortin et al 2001 the vertical water balance module simulates vertical distribution of soil moisture in the soil profile there are two possible sub modules bv3c and cequeau in this study bv3c was employed the bv3c is a french abbreviation which stands for bilan vertical à 3 couches which can be translated as a three layer vertical water budget fortin et al 2001 jougla and leconte 2022 in bv3c the soil column is vertically discretized into three layers the first layer represents the top few centimeters typically 5 cm which is commensurate with the penetration depth of l band passive microwave remote sensing satellites such as smap this layer is used for partitioning of the rainfall and or snow melt into surface runoff and infiltration the second layer has a depth of 70 120 cm and is responsible for producing interflow whereas the third layer is often close to saturation with typical depth of 200 400 cm and it is responsible for producing baseflow the water exchange between these layers is controlled by the one dimensional richards equation 2 3 1 calibration and validation of hydrotel before incorporation of the smap soil moisture into soil moisture module the hydrotel model was calibrated using the dynamically dimensioned search dds tolson and shoemaker 2007 algorithm for historical time period of 1981 2006 using the observed streamflow separately both for susquehanna and upper susquehanna watersheds afterwards it was validated with streamflow for the period between 2007 and 2016 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was used as the objective function both calibration and validation were performed at a daily time step the performance of the model was evaluated using nse lognse gaur et al 2021 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 1998 the nse lognse and kge value ranges between and 1 nse lognse or kge value of 1 indicates a perfect model agreement between the simulated and observed streamflow i e ideal condition in general the higher the nse lognse and kge values the better the performance of the model and vice versa 2 4 experimental setup after evaluation of the robustness of the model through calibration and validation a simple data assimilation technique known as direct insertion technique walker et al 2001 was adopted for updating the hydrotel model with the smap soil moisture obtained for summer and early fall seasons may to october of the year 2018 in this study direct insertion involves replacing the model simulated soil moisture at each rhhu directly with the smap soil moisture it is worth to note that prior to replacing the simulated soil moisture the smap soil moisture was bias corrected to model simulated soil moisture using the cumulative distribution function matching approach cdf so that they could have similar climatology the direct insertion technique was deemed appropriate in this study compared to more complex assimilation techniques such as enkf as the main objective of this paper is to scrutinize the added value of smap derived soil moisture in a hydrological model for streamflow simulation in this study we used ingestion interchangeably with the direct insertion and it can be defined as a method of incorporating external observations e g in situ and satellite observations into hydrological model a suite of experiments was implemented by alternately updating the hydrotel model with different spatial resolutions of smap soil moisture including the original smap at 36 km and downscaled smap at 9 3 and 1 km resolutions the model was updated based on two approaches the first approach involves updating the model based on the availability of the smap soil moisture with full watershed coverage every 3 5 days followed by model propagation of soil moisture from surface soil to deeper layers until the next smap soil moisture observation becomes available putting differently the frequency of updating depends on the availability of smap soil moisture observations with full watershed coverage alternatively the second approach involves updating the model based on watershed averaged high rainfall events that could generate high streamflow events in this context the updating was carried out only prior to selected high rainfall events which is relevant in an operational flow forecasting environment in this approach the frequency of updating was low as there are only few events this approach was implemented to investigate whether varying the frequency of updating hence the duration of model propagation will impact on streamflow simulation the selection of high rainfall events was based on a simple graphical visualisation approach where the watershed averaged rainfall events are plotted along with the corresponding magnitude of streamflow in this context only those rainfall events which generated high streamflow events are selected visually in the end a non updated hydrotel model also known as open loop was forced with the ensemble of precipitation and temperature time series to generate ensemble streamflow and used as benchmark for comparison to other experiments fig 3 in another experiment in addition to the model s top layer its second layer was updated by using vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture the adopted vertical extrapolation method was based on a simple assumption that the model simulated surface soil moisture has strong relationship with deep layer soil moisture thus polynomial curve fitting was performed in order to establish an empirical relationship between model simulated surface and second layer soil moisture which then used to vertically extrapolate the smap surface soil moisture this experiment is meant to bypass the time the model takes to self adjust to new surface soil moisture observations i e model propagation of soil moisture from top to bottom layer here it is worthwhile to be aware that this assumption is not the best assumption as the surface and deep layer soil moisture response to precipitation varies in other words the lagging of root zone soil moisture behind surface soil moisture both in wetting and drying could affect the assumption in particular this assumption neglects potential surface subsurface soil moisture decoupling effects which can be significant in fine textured soils with low vegetated surfaces capehart and carlson 1997 however our intent is to give a general picture because of the paucity of in situ soil moisture over the susquehanna watershed to implement more robust method such as exponential filtering or machine learning techniques finally to investigate the relationship between the spatial resolutions of downscaled smap soil moisture and size of the watershed the model was run at the outlets of the susquehanna watershed and its upper sub watershed the susquehanna watershed was selected basically because of its large spatial extent with variety of land cover types and experience of floods thus investigation of the impact of pre storm soil moisture on the magnitude of flood in such watershed is deemed important in addition to the graphical framework in fig 2 the numerical experiments implemented in this study were summarized in table 3 the table shows two cases the first case involves updating the model top layer with the smap surface soil moisture at spatial resolutions of 1 3 9 and 36 km whereas the second case involves updating the model top and second layers with surface and vertically extrapolated smap with spatial resolutions of 1 3 9 and 36 km respectively in addition the two approaches of updating were considered updating when smap soil moisture with good quality is available and updating prior to high rainfall events these experiments were implemented both for the susquehanna and upper susquehanna watershed 2 4 1 evaluation of the benefit of updating the model with smap soil moisture the added value of direct insertion of the smap soil moisture in improving model performance for prediction of the ensemble streamflow simulation was estimated by means of the efficiency index eff the normalized root mean square error nrmse and the continuous ranked probability skill score crpss the eff measures the effect of ingestion with respect to the open loop run a positive eff value indicates improvement of ensemble streamflow simulation due to ingestion of the smap soil moisture whereas the negative value indicates deterioration 1 eff 1 t 1 t q up t q obs t 2 t 1 t q ol t q obs t 2 where qobs is observed streamflow q up and q ol mean of ensemble of simulated streamflow by the updated and non updated ol model respectively the nrmse represents the ratio of the root mean square error rmse between predicted ensemble streamflow after soil moisture ingestion and observed streamflow to the rmse of between the open loop ensemble and observed streamflow it provides information about the ensemble spread and the ensemble mean performance its value greater than 1 indicates the deterioration of the results where a value lower than 1 shows improvement 2 nrmse 1 n i 1 n t 1 t q up t q obs t 2 1 n i 1 n t 1 t q ol t q obs t 2 where n and t are ensemble size and length of time series considered in addition the continuous ranked probability skill score crpss is employed to assess the skill of the ensemble streamflow simulation its score varies between and 1 the score greater than zero indicates an improvement in the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations due to updating of the model with the smap soil moisture 3 crpss 1 crps updated crps non updated 4 crps 1 n i 1 n f i x f i 0 x 2 dx f 0 x 0 x observed streamflow value 1 x observed streamflow value where the crps is the continuous ranked probability score fi x is probability density function of the member of the ensemble simulation fi x is probability density function of observation the summer and early fall seasons of 2018 may october were selected for evaluation of the impact of ingestion of smap soil moisture on the ensemble streamflow simulations this is primarily because of better quality smap soil moisture during this period compared to the rest of the seasons i e winter and spring indeed in winter the soil is likely frozen near the surface whereas in the spring it is often affected by snowmelt on the other hand the selection of the year 2018 for the ingestion experiment was based on fact that it was one of the two wet years i e 2011 and 2018 in the decade 2010 2020 interestingly the smap mission also started providing soil moisture data during this decade put differently smap started providing soil moisture in 2015 which in turn makes the selection of the year 2018 more appropriate evidently the wet years result in wet soil moisture condition which in turn plays an important role in determining the magnitude of runoff thus focusing on such a year is deemed appropriate to see the impact of soil moisture ingestion on the accuracy of streamflow simulation 3 results 3 1 deterministic calibration and validation of hydrotel fig 3 displays a comparison of daily time series of observed and simulated streamflow at the outlet of the susquehanna watershed during calibration and validation periods the visual comparison indicates that both the timing and magnitude of simulated streamflow is in reasonable agreement with the observed streamflow apart from the underestimation or overestimation of some of the peak events besides the low flows are well reproduced by the model furthermore the statistical metrics confirmed good model performance in both calibration nse 0 81 lognse 0 69 and kge 0 76 and validation nse 0 78 lognse 0 63 and kge 0 74 similarly for the upper susquehanna watershed the nse kge values of 0 68 0 64 and 0 63 0 60 were obtained during calibration and validation respectively similarly the lognse values of 0 59 and 0 57 were obtained for calibration and validation respectively 3 2 downscaling of the smap soil moisture fig 4 shows an example of maps of the spatial distribution of the original smap soil moisture with resolution of 36 km and its downscaled version at 1 3 and 9 km for 17th of june 2018 the downscaled smap soil moisture at all spatial resolutions well reproduced the spatial patterns of their original counterpart for example the eastern and western parts of the watershed are characterized by wetter soil moisture conditions whereas the northern and southern parts are characterized by lower and medium range soil moisture respectively both for the original and downscaled versions in addition at higher spatial resolutions e g at 1 and 3 km the effect of land covers on the downscaled soil moisture is easily discernable this is a direct effect of including land cover related predictors in the downscaling algorithm such as the ndvi and lst in addition it can be inferred from the figure that the spatial details of the smap soil moisture is increased after downscaling fig 5 shows maps of spatial distribution of prism precipitation across the susquehanna watershed from june 13 to 16 inclusively as can be seen in the figure the lower part of the watershed is characterized by low precipitation especially on june 13th of 2018 whereas the northeastern and northwestern parts are characterized relatively by higher precipitation the next day june 14th the lower part of the watershed received high precipitation whereas the middle western part received precipitation with medium ranges during the remaining consecutive days the watershed almost did not receive precipitation overall the smap soil moisture displayed in fig 4 well responded to precipitation showed in fig 5 for example soil moisture in the western and northeastern parts are wet due to precipitation on june 13 and 14 of 2018 besides the spatial pattern comparisons the time series comparison of the original and downscaled smap soil moisture was also performed using the existing in situ soil moisture measurements fig 1 both the original and downscaled smap soil moisture well reproduced the temporal dynamics of in situ soil moisture at a location of the in situ measurements note that we did not show extensive validation results in this study as this was part of our previous work wakigari and leconte 2022 3 3 ingestion of smap soil moisture with different spatial resolutions this section presents the results of ingestion of the smap soil moisture into hydrotel model for the susquehanna watershed the top layer of the model was replaced with different spatial resolutions of smap soil moisture i e 1 3 9 and 36 km however only the results of the model updated by 36 and 1 km were presented in the figures to avoid over crowdedness but the performance metrics for all the resolutions are presented in tables 5 and 6 fig 6 displays the comparison of the ensemble streamflow simulations between the non updated i e open loop and updated model with the original 36 km and downscaled smap soil moisture 1 km for the susquehanna watershed as can be seen from the figure compared to the non updated model fig 6a updating of the model both with the original fig 6b and downscaled smap fig 6c soil moisture reduced the ensemble spread while keeping the observed streamflow within the simulated ensemble spread for example during the end of july and beginning of august the non updated model produced a large ensemble spread but after ingestion of the original and downscaled smap at 1 km the simulated ensemble peaks were reduced and matched well with the observation indeed the ensemble mean also shifted towards the observation and adequately captured its magnitude and timing when comparing among the different spatial resolutions ingestion of the 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture reduced the ensemble spread and improved the simulation of ensemble mean followed by the 3 and 9 km downscaled smap products and lastly by the original version of smap with resolution of 36 km corresponding statistical metrics are presented in table 5 on the other hand ingestion of the original smap i e 36 km and 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture did not lead to significant differences in simulating peak and low flows except for a few peak flows for example ingestion of the 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture tends to underestimate peak flow near mid september while the ingestion of 36 km smap soil moisture was able to capture 3 4 updating the model intermediate soil layer this section presents the results of ingestion of the vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture into hydrotel model for the susquehanna watershed the top and second layers of the model were replaced with different spatial resolutions of smap soil moisture i e 1 3 9 and 36 km however only the results of the model updated by 36 and 1 km were presented in the figures to avoid over crowdedness but the performance metrics for all the resolutions are presented in table 5 the soil moisture in the intermediate i e the second layer layer plays an important role in the runoff generation brocca et al 2010 in this experiment besides the top layer of the model the vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture was used to update the second layer of the hydrotel model which has thickness of about 70 cm fig 7 shows the comparison of the ensemble streamflow simulations between the non updated and the updated model with both surface and vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture compared to the non updated model fig 7a the ingestion of both surface and vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture into model s top and second layers respectively reduced the ensemble spread and moved the ensemble mean closely to observation both for the cases of the original fig 7b and downscaled smap at 1 km fig 7c when comparing among the smap spatial resolutions the ingestion of the 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture showed better results than the original smap for example the ensemble mean of the updated model with the downscaled smap at 1 km closely matches the observed streamflow than when updating the model with the original smap fig 7 similarly the spread of the ensemble is slightly lower for the downscaled smap at 1 km generally the 1 km downscaled smap is more effective in improving the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations followed by the 3 9 and 36 km smap resolutions respectively comparing the results of updating only the top layer of the model fig 6 with the updating both the top and second layers fig 7 the latter agrees well with the observation notably when the 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture is ingested for example in fig 6c the ensemble underestimated the observed streamflow peak near the end of july but after updating both top and second layers the ensemble well captured the observed peak as can be seen in fig 7c 3 5 updating the model at different frequencies this section presents the results of the impact frequency of updating of the model on its prediction the model was updated based on the watershed averaged high rainfall events fig 8 prior to a runoff event in contrast to the previous sections where the updating of the model was based on the availability of smap soil moisture with full watershed coverage as can be seen in the fig 8 about 10 rainfall events which produced high streamflow events were selected of which three are very high i e end of august mid august and mid september the plotted histogram represents time series of watershed averaged precipitation whereas the blue line indicates the observed streamflow at the outlet of the susquehanna watershed it is worth noting that this approach reduces the frequency of updating compared to the updating when the smap soil moisture with full watershed coverage is available in other words the model was left to propagate the soil moisture information over longer periods of time between successive updating times the model updating dates are presented in table 4 and also indicated in fig 8 by vertical black dashed lines fig 9 shows comparison of the ensemble streamflow simulations of the non updated and updated model with the 1 km downscaled and original smap surface soil moisture prior to the selected rainfall events fig 8 the updating was made for the top layer of the model for the susquehanna watershed after updating the model the spread of the ensemble is reduced and mean of the ensemble members closely matches the observation a visual comparison between the results of updating the model based on high rainfall events fig 9 and updating of the model based on the availability of smap soil moisture fig 6 shows no apparent differences besides the visual interpretations table 5 summarizes the statistical performance of all the experiments implemented in this study for the susquehanna watershed the statistical metrics generally indicated the outperformance of the updated model for all the smap resolutions compared to the non updated model however the degree of accuracy varies with the spatial resolution ingested into the model for example updating with the 1 km downscaled smap surface soil moisture showed better performance eff 87 30 m3 s nrmse 0 81 and crpss 0 17 compared to updating with the original version of smap surface soil moisture with resolution of 36 km eff 66 03 m3 s nrmse 0 85 and crpss 0 10 similarly the 3 and 9 km spatial resolution generally have performance better than the original resolution of smap however downscaling to higher spatial resolution such as 1 and 3 km did not bring significant improvements as shown in table 5 when comparing the model updated with the smap surface soil moisture with the one updated with both surface and vertically extrapolated smap the latter demonstrated a slightly better performance than the former in terms of eff for the 1 and 3 km resolution however the nrmse almost remain the same for all the resolutions and crpss is reduced for all the resolutions as shown in table 5 similarly when considering surface soil moisture only the high rainfall events based updating generally improved the model performance for all the resolutions of smap soil moisture than when updating based on the availability of smap surface soil moisture for example updating the model with the 1 km downscaled smap surface soil moisture based on high rainfall events increased eff from 87 30 m3 s to 99 50 m3 s reduced nrmse from 0 81 to 0 77 and increased the crpss from 0 17 to 0 24 3 6 updating the model at subbasin scale an additional experiment was also implemented to investigate if the spatial resolution of smap soil moisture is related with the watershed size to examine this the ingestion of the smap surface soil moisture was carried out at sub watershed scale i e the upper susquehanna sub watershed and compared with the results obtained in the previous sections for the susquehanna watershed fig 10 shows the ensemble streamflow simulations by the non updated and updated model with the original and downscaled smap surface soil moisture at 1 km for the upper susquehanna watershed compared to the non updated model fig 10a the updated model with the smap soil moisture at both spatial resolutions reduced the ensemble spread while keeping the ensemble mean closer to the observation when comparing between the 1 km and original smap soil moisture for example during mid august and end of september the spread of the ensemble further lowered when ingesting the 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture fig 10b than the original smap with resolution of 36 km fig 10c likewise the ensemble mean agrees well with observed streamflow for the 1 km downscaled smap than the original smap these results are comparable to those obtained over the entire susquehanna watershed table 6 presents the comparison of the performances of ingestion of the smap soil moisture at watershed and sub watershed scales at both scales the ingestion of the smap soil moisture at all spatial resolutions improved the performance of the model as indicated by the nrmse value less than one the eff and crpss values greater than zero table 6 interestingly the ingestion of the 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture shows more improvement at sub watershed scale with eff nrmse and crpss values of 97 90 0 72 and 0 21 respectively than at watershed scale with eff nrmse and crpss values of 87 30 0 81 and 0 17 respectively model improvement is also noted at 3 km resolution on the upper susquehanna but to a lesser extent than at 1 km likewise the ingestion of the 1 km vertically extrapolated downscaled smap soil moisture shows significant improvement at the sub watershed scale than at the watershed scale as can be seen in the table 6 4 discussion 4 1 ingestion of the smap soil moisture updating of the model through direct insertion of the smap soil moisture at all the spatial resolutions resulted in a considerable improvement in the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations compared to the non updated model i e open loop see table 5 however the degree of improvement varies depending on the spatial resolution of the inserted smap soil moisture for example for the susquehanna watershed ingestion of the 9 km downscaled smap soil moisture showed slightly better accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations with eff nrmse and crpss values of 92 89 0 80 and 0 17 respectively compared to ingestion of the 1 km 3 km downscaled smap soil moisture with eff nrmse and crpss values of 87 30 91 5 0 81 0 80 and 0 17 0 16 respectively this indicates that downscaling to higher spatial resolutions e g 1 and 3 km is not that much important as the 9 km downscaled smap adequately represent the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture for a large watershed like the susquehanna the downscaling of the smap soil moisture generally improved the representation of spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture and this heterogeneity is heavily dependent on the complex interaction of intertwined geophysical and atmospheric factors such as soil properties topography vegetation and meteorological forcing crow et al 2012 however the effect of these factors varies based on the spatial scale for example at larger scale the meteorological forcing plays an important role whereas at finer scale topography and soil properties such as texture become more crucial western et al 2002 this insight supports the importance of downscaling the coarse resolution smap soil moisture products to higher spatial resolutions in order to capture soil moisture spatial variability at finer scale indeed possibly for this reason the downscaled smap at all resolutions gave better results than the original smap soil moisture however because of the large size of the susquehanna watershed downscaled smap at 9 km adequately represented the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture in the watershed thereby substantially improving the streamflow simulation and reducing the importance of going to higher spatial resolutions i e 1 and 3 km as there is no further improvement in the accuracy of ensemble streamflow simulation as shown in table 5 on the other hand the size of model rhhus varies between 0 5 and 450 km2 and the average rhhus size is 70 km2 which is comparable with the area of the 9 km downscaled smap soil moisture i e 9 km 9 km 81 km2 besides the large size of susquehanna watershed the size of rhhus confirms why going to higher spatial resolution of smap is not that important as high spatial resolution smap soil moisture aggregates back to the size of rhhus differently from previous studies such as that of abbaszadeh et al 2020 which focused on assimilation of smap at 1 and 36 km for the watershed with area of roughly 2577 km2 our study updated the model with the smap soil moisture with the range resolutions including 1 3 9 and 36 km for a large watershed with area of 71000 km2 nevertheless their results are in line with our finding showing improvement in the model prediction of streamflow after assimilation of the downscaled smap at 1 km compared to its original version with resolution of 36 km similarly le et al 2022 found improvement in the accuracy streamflow simulation after assimilation of the smap enhanced soil moisture 9 km and its downscaled version at 1 km into swat model they reported significant improvement in the accuracy streamflow simulation when the downscaled smap at 1 km assimilated for eight watersheds with area ranging from 267 to 6430 km2 in general our study area is roughly 10 20 times larger than the study areas of abbaszadeh et al 2020 and le et al 2022 which suggested that for our case the downscaled smap at coarser resolution i e 9 km is adequate enough for simulation of accurate streamflow as mentioned previously in the context of the ongoing controversy regarding the usefulness satellite soil moisture our study supports those studies that found the effectiveness of satellite soil moisture in improving the accuracy of model prediction abbaszadeh et al 2020 azimi et al 2020 brocca et al 2012 le et al 2022 loizu et al 2018a this is because in our study the insertion of the smap soil moisture both at its original and downscaled resolutions showed considerable improvement in the ensemble streamflow simulation when compared to the non updated model this study also demonstrated the effectiveness of a simple direct insertion technique for the ingestion of the smap soil moisture this technique is simple and could be computationally faster than those used in many soil moisture ingestion studies such as the ensemble kalman filter azimi et al 2020 lievens et al 2015 loizu et al 2018b particle filtering technique abbaszadeh et al 2020 and a smoothing framework crow and ryu 2009 it is also worth noting that this study did not use the existing high resolution smap soil moisture products this is primarily because of the low temporal resolution of these products for example the 1 and 3 km existing smap sentinel 1 soil moisture products have temporal resolution of 12 days over the susquehanna watershed whereas the downscaled smap products in this study have temporal resolution of 2 3 days similarly the existing 9 km smap enhanced soil moisture did not show significant difference compared to smap l3 36 km in terms of portraying spatial detail of soil moisture wakigari and leconte 2022 this is primarily because it was simply generated using mathematical interpolation i e backus gilbert optimal interpolation from smap l3 whereas our downscaled products shows more detailed soil moisture information as our downscaling approach based on the use of high resolution land surface variables which have strong association with soil moisture 4 2 the effect of ingestion rootzone soil moisture soil moisture at deeper depths has a strong impact on runoff generation brocca et al 2012 in this study the ingestion of the vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture further improved the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow prediction when compared to the ingestion smap surface soil moisture only however the improvement is not that significant for example the nrmse is only reduced by 0 01 for the 9 and 1 km resolutions whereas for the 3 and 36 km there is no change the eff values are moderately increased notably for the 3 and 1 km however the crpss values are reduced for all the smap resolutions see table 5 this inconsistency in improving the model performance among the inserted resolutions of the smap soil moisture could be attributed to the simple empirical polynomial fitting approach adopted for the vertical extrapolation of the smap surface soil moisture this approach has no strong physical basis as opposed to those used in the previous studies such as the exponential filter albergel et al 2008 brocca et al 2012 in addition the paucity of in situ soil moisture measurements in the study area impedes the validation of the proposed method in addition the model performance might be affected by model subsurface physics as it is not explicitly designed take into account the coupling between the top and second layers of the model compared to previous studies such as the one by brocca et al 2012 which reported marked improvement in the model performance after assimilation of the vertically extrapolated ascat soil moisture our study found only slight improvement after updating the second layer of the model with the vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture this is because besides the difference in the extrapolation method used as stated above part of this inconsistency could be attributed to the difference in physiographic characteristics between the study watersheds our study watershed is large and dominated by forest where there could be strong vertical coupling between the top and second layers compared that of brocca et al 2012 which is small watershed with area of 137 km2 and mainly covered with woods and croplands thus in our study updating the second layer of the model might add water to the system thereby upsetting the water balance and resulting in only slight improvement in the streamflow prediction compared to updating the top layer only 4 3 the effect of frequency of updating as stated previously in the present study two approaches were adopted to update the model in the first one the model was updated based on the availability of the smap soil moisture with the full watershed coverage whereas in the second approach the model was updated based on the expected high rainfall events in the second approach the frequency of updating was reduced since there are only a few high rainfall events the decrease in the frequency of updating in the second approach further improved the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulation compared to the first approach for example for the susquehanna watershed ingestion of the 9 km downscaled smap into a model based on high rainfall events shows better accuracy with eff nrmse and crpss values of 98 73 0 78 and 0 21 respectively than when model updated based on the availability of smap which has eff nrmse and crpss values of 92 89 0 80 and 0 17 respectively similarly for the 1 km downscaled smap eff increased from 87 30 to 99 50 nrmse decreased from 0 81 to 0 77 and crpss increased from 0 17 to 0 24 when the model updated based on high rainfall events compared to updating based on the availability of smap this improvement could be explained by the fact that the reduction in the frequency of updating provides more time for the ingested smap soil moisture to adjust itself to the ambient conditions during the time between two successive events besides the frequency of updating could be affected by the smap soil moisture retrieval quality which in turn could affect the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations this simply means that the model performance possibly benefited from reducing the frequency of updating because the quality of the smap soil moisture might not be as optimal as it should be this is primarily because of the presence of vegetation over the susquehanna watershed which affects the retrieval quality of the smap wakigari and leconte 2022 when it comes to updating based on the availability of smap soil moisture this study is in line with those of abbaszadeh et al 2020 jadidoleslam et al 2021 and le et al 2022 who also reported improvement in model performance however with regard to updating based on high rainfall events our finding disagrees with the finding of azimi et al 2020 who reported decrease in model performance after reducing the model updating frequency with the ascat soil moisture for two small watersheds i e niccone 137 km2 and chiascio 165 km2 of the upper tiber river basin italy 4 4 the impact of watershed size this study demonstrated that for the larger watershed i e the susquehanna watershed the ingestion of the original resolution smap i e 36 km or downscaled smap surface soil moisture at coarser spatial resolutions e g 9 km per se improved the ensemble streamflow simulations without the need to go to higher spatial resolutions for example ingestion of the 9 km downscaled smap soil moisture had slightly better accuracy with eff nrmse and crpss values of 92 89 0 80 and 0 17 respectively compared to ingestion of the 1 km downscaled smap with eff nrmse and crpss values of 87 30 0 81 and 0 17 respectively this is because the susquehanna watershed is large in size and could be covered by a large number of pixels of the original or the 9 km downscaled smap this in turn allows to adequately characterize the spatial variability of soil moisture in relation to runoff generation without the requirement of downscaling the smap to higher spatial resolutions e g 1 and 3 km on the other hand for the upper susquehanna watershed the 1 and 3 km downscaled smap soil moisture markedly improved the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulation for example ingestion of the 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture showed better accuracy with eff nrmse and crpss values of 97 90 0 72 and 0 21 respectively compared to ingestion of the 9 km smap soil moisture with eff nrmse and crpss values 90 30 0 74 and 0 16 respectively this is primarily because the 1 km downscaled smap better represent the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture for this watershed than the downscaled smap at 9 km for example about 19 440 pixels of the 1 km downscaled smap cover the upper susquehanna watershed whereas about 15 and 240 pixels are required for the 36 and 9 km smap respectively overall the 1 km downscaled smap is hydrologically more commensurable with the size of the upper susquehanna watershed whereas the 9 and 36 km are not sufficient enough to describe the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture and its impact on watershed behavior this is why downscaling to higher spatial resolution is important for the upper susquehanna watershed similar results were reported by le et al 2022 through the ingestion of the smap enhanced soil moisture 9 km and its downscaled version at 1 km resolution for streamflow simulation in eight catchments with a range of areas from 267 to 6430 km2 across tropical vietnam they found that the benefit of downscaled smap at 1 km is more pronounced for streamflow simulation in the smaller watersheds this is consistent with our study which revealed that the 1 km downscaled smap relative to the original smap improved the ensemble streamflow simulation notably for the upper susquehanna watershed in general for the smaller watershed going to higher spatial resolution is important to adequately characterize the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture and its impact on hydrological processes yet for the larger watershed going to higher spatial resolutions does not seem to offer significant benefits while increasing computational workload this because for the larger watershed spatial heterogeneity tend to decrease with the watershed size asano and uchida 2010 5 conclusions over the last decades the availability of spatially distributed remotely sensed observations of near surface soil moisture has been growing this has sparked interest in the incorporation of these observations into distributed hydrological models hence this study was designed to ingest the smap soil moisture with a range of spatial resolutions from 1 to 36 km into a distributed hydrological model called hydrotel using a direct insertion technique a set of experiments was carried out to evaluate the impact of vertical extrapolation frequency of updating and spatial resolution on simulation of the ensemble streamflow for two contrasting watersheds i e the susquehanna and one of its head sub watersheds the upper susquehanna watershed mainly in terms of size the results showed that the ingestion of the smap soil moisture at all the spatial resolutions i e 1 3 9 and 36 km improved the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations in the susquehanna watershed when comparing the impact of spatial resolution of the smap soil moisture on the accuracy of ensemble streamflow simulations the direct insertion of the 9 km downscaled smap soil moisture showed better accuracy and going to higher resolution did not result in further improvement as the root zone soil moisture plays an essential role in the runoff generation the present study vertically extrapolated the smap surface soil moisture to deep layer and ingested into the hydrotel model the results demonstrated that the insertion of the vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture only slightly further improved the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations compared to the insertion of smap surface soil moisture only this could be partly attributed to the simplicity of the assumption adopted subsurface physics of the model physiographic characteristics of the watershed e g soil type and land cover and lack of the in situ soil moisture data for validation of the adopted extrapolation approach the finding of this study also demonstrated that the direct insertion of the smap soil moisture based on the expected high rainfall events reduced the frequency of updating which in turn slightly increased the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations and lowered the computational time compared to the updating based on the availability smap soil moisture this is because reducing the frequency of updating offers more time for soil moisture to propagate to the rootzone between two subsequent updating times with regards to the impact of the watershed size the ensemble streamflow simulation at sub watershed scale was more benefited from the 1 and 3 km downscaled smap soil moisture than the original 36 km or downscaled smap at coarse spatial resolution 9 km for the susquehanna watershed which is larger in size i e 71 000 km2 the downscaled smap soil moisture at coarse spatial resolutions could be sufficient for the optimum streamflow simulation yet for the upper susquehanna watershed with area of 20 000 km2 the downscaled smap at higher spatial resolutions i e 1 or 3 km is important to properly describe the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture it is worth to mention that above half our study area is forested which in turn affected the quality of the smap soil moisture retrieval indeed the assimilation of the sub optimal quality smap soil moisture retrieval over such an area can have impact on the accuracy of the simulated streamflow our study did not investigate this issue which should be addressed particularly in the context of operational streamflow forecasting in future studies one could also compare the simple direct insertion technique adopted in the present study with computationally demanding techniques such as the ensemble kalman filter and particle filter and improving the model subsurface physics for data assimilation could be an interesting research topic the studies which use the ensemble of the actual weather forecast data in conjunction with assimilation of satellite soil moisture products for the operational streamflow forecast is also encouraged finally studies on the comparison of the assimilation of different satellite soil moisture products passive and active microwave remote sensing could be interesting for identifying the most suitable product for a given watershed credit

7643,study region the susquehanna and upper susquehanna watersheds in the northeastern of the united states of america usa study focus this study explored the utility of the soil moisture active passive smap soil moisture downscaled to a range of spatial resolutions for improving ensemble streamflow simulations the smap level 3 soil moisture product with spatial resolution of roughly 40 km was downscaled to a range of spatial resolutions including 1 3 and 9 km over the susquehanna and upper susquehanna watersheds a set of experiments was conducted through direct insertion of the downscaled smap soil moisture into a physically based distributed hydrological model new hydrological insights for the region the updating of the model with the original and downscaled smap surface soil moisture markedly improved the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations with the crpss and nrmse values in the range of 0 10 0 17 and 0 79 0 85 respectively when compared to the non updated model for the susquehanna watershed in addition the ensemble spread was reduced and the ensemble mean compares well with the observed streamflow the 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture showed the highest accuracy in improving streamflow simulation with the crpss and nrmse value of 0 21 and 0 72 respectively for the upper susquehanna watershed whereas for the susquehanna watershed downscaled smap at 9 km adequately improved the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations with the crpss and nrmse value of 0 17 and 0 80 respectively besides the top layer of the model updating the second layer of the model with the vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture only slightly further improved the accuracy of the model graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil moisture smap downscaling updating improving streamflow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture plays an essential role in the runoff generation as it controls the partitioning of incoming precipitation into surface runoff and infiltration this is particularly important in the case of the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism dunne et al 1975 where the magnitude of the flood is determined by the pre storm soil moisture state of the watershed soil moisture also plays an important role in the partitioning of incoming net radiative energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes which in turn control near surface variables such as temperature and humidity entekhabi 1995 moreover a host of hydrometeorological and agricultural applications including hydrological forecasting weather forecasting and irrigation planning is heavily dependent on soil moisture state conventionally in situ measurements are used to characterize the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture they provide the most accurate and reliable soil moisture information but with low spatial representativeness dobriyal et al 2012 besides they are time consuming and costly to establish their network over a larger area alternatively satellite passive microwave remote sensing notably at l band frequency 1 4 ghz offers the potential to map near surface soil moisture approximately at 5 cm depth at a global scale with decent temporal resolution i e 2 3 days entekhabi et al 2008 njoku and entekhabi 1996 indeed the l band passive microwave satellites are widely recognized as a superior alternative for soil moisture retrieval because of their strong sensitivity to soil moisture dynamics and capability to penetrate through cloud and vegetation canopy jackson and schmugge 1991 schmugge et al 1986 typical examples are soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 and soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2008 the smos is the first ever l band passive microwave mission dedicated to monitoring soil moisture and sea surface salinity at a global scale it was launched by the european space agency esa in 2009 and provides a global map of near surface soil moisture every 2 3 days with resolution of about 40 km kerr et al 2001 similarly the national aeronautics and space administration nasa launched the smap on january 31 2015 which carries both l band radar and radiometer sharing a single platform but the radar ceased operation on july 7 2015 colliander et al 2017 currently only the radiometer component continues the generation of soil moisture maps at roughly 40 km spatial resolution every 2 3 days however despite their well established methods for mapping near surface soil moisture the spatial resolution of smos and smap is coarse on the other hand there has been a growing interest over the last decades in the incorporation of passive microwave soil moisture products e g smos and smap into hydrological models for improving streamflow simulation and forecasting brocca et al 2011 peng et al 2021 reichle 2008 this is mainly because of the increased availability of spatially distributed soil moisture observations from the passive microwave remote sensing and the key role that soil moisture plays as the main state variable of hydrological models however as stated before the spatial resolution of passive microwave soil moisture products is generally coarse i e 25 50 km indeed this resolution deemed sufficient for continental and global scale hydrometeorological applications but a host of hydrometeorological and agricultural applications at local and regional scales require soil moisture information at high spatial resolution i e a kilometer or less thus the scale disparity between the resolution of satellite soil moisture products and hydrological applications requirement should be reduced one possible approach to reduce this disparity and enhance spatial resolution of passive microwave soil moisture products is through spatial downscaling sabaghy et al 2017 many previous studies have used different spatial downscaling methods such as those based on the universal triangle concept or machine learning among many others liu et al 2020 peng et al 2017 sabaghy et al 2018 to downscale the coarse resolution passive microwave soil moisture products however majority of these studies have downscaled passive microwave soil moisture products with the objective to reduce the spatial scale disparity between the satellite soil moisture products i e 25 50 km and in situ soil moisture measurements i e in the order of few centimeters often for the purpose of validation of satellite soil moisture products for example zhao et al 2018 abbaszadeh et al 2019 and wakigari and leconte 2022 downscaled the smap soil moisture from 36 to 1 km over iberian peninsula continental united states conus and susquehanna river basin respectively and validated with in situ soil moisture measurements likewise djamai et al 2015 piles and sánchez 2016 and zheng et al 2021 downscaled the smos soil moisture to 1 km over the canadian prairies murrumbidgee watershed australia and huai river basin china respectively and validated with in situ soil moisture measurements these studies have not extended the downscaled product for hydrological applications on the other hand there are only few studies which have downscaled passive microwave soil moisture products with the objective to use for local scale hydrological applications abbaszadeh et al 2020 le et al 2022 lópez lópez et al 2016 for example abbaszadeh et al 2020 downscaled the smap soil moisture from 36 to 1 km and assimilated into wrf hydro model using the particle filter pf for the watershed located in the southeastern part of texas united states with warm and humid climate and moderately dense vegetation similarly le et al 2022 assimilated 1 km downscaled smap into swat model using the ensemble kalman filter enkf for eight watersheds located across tropical vietnam with area ranging from 267 to 6340 km2 three of the watersheds are dominated by forest land cover and the remaining five are dominated by shrubland and cropland in addition lópez lópez et al 2016 assimilated the 9 km downscaled soil moisture derived from amsr e into two distributed hydrological models i e the local openstreams wflow sbm and the global pcr globwb for murrumbidgee river basin australia which is a dry watershed with sparse vegetation overall these studies have found improvement in streamflow simulation due to the assimilation of downscaled soil moisture products alternatively there are many studies which have assimilated the original resolution i e 25 50 km passive microwave soil moisture products derived from different satellites without downscaling for local and regional scale hydrological applications jadidoleslam et al 2021 kumar et al 2014 lievens et al 2015 for example jadidoleslam et al 2021 found significant improvement in streamflow simulation after assimilation of the coarse spatial resolution smos and smap soil moisture into a distributed hydrological model using ensemble kalman filter enkf for 131 united states geological survey s usgs gauges in heavily agricultural region of iowa state united states conversely kumar et al 2014 assimilated amsr e soil moisture retrievals into noah land surface model using enkf for 572 small watersheds with area ranging between 645 and 10 000 km2 and 19 large watersheds with area ranging between 19 036 and 682 465 km2 across the conus they reported minor improvement in streamflow simulation across most watersheds lievens et al 2015 found improvement only in peak flows after assimilation of smos soil moisture using enkf into the variable infiltration capacity vic model their study was conducted on murray darling basin australia with an approximate area of 1 million km2 this basin is dominated by grassland 26 shrubs 23 deciduous broadleaf trees 21 and crops 9 and it is characterized by semi arid climate on the other hand parajka et al 2006 reported no improvement at all in streamflow simulation after assimilation of ers scatterometer soil moisture it is worth noting that the assimilation of coarse spatial resolution passive microwave soil moisture products resulted in contrasting results indeed while some studies have found significant improvement in simulation and forecasting of the streamflow brocca et al 2012 massari et al 2015 wanders et al 2014 a considerable number of other studies have reported no to little benefit of satellite soil moisture in improving the streamflow simulation and forecasting alvarez garreton et al 2014 kumar et al 2014 parajka et al 2006 overall the lack of consensus among these studies on whether the incorporation of remotely sensed soil moisture into models improves the accuracy of streamflow simulation and flood forecasting or not might be explained by 1 the difference in models used e g lumped semi distributed or physically based fully distributed models 2 assimilation techniques used i e direct insertion enkf or particle filter 3 watershed characteristics e g location size land cover soil type and dominant hydrological processes and 4 characteristics of the assimilated remotely sensed soil moisture products e g retrieval algorithm accuracy and quality penetration depth spatial support and temporal availability mao et al 2019 moreover as remotely sensed soil moisture represents only the upper few centimeters of the soil the degree of its coupling with subsurface soil moisture could also determine the accuracy of hydrological model prediction capehart and carlson 1997 chen et al 2011 overall the contrasting results reported by previous studies after assimilation of coarse spatial resolution passive microwave soil moisture highlight the importance of further exploring its utility in improving the accuracy streamflow simulation in addition a point worth noting is that only few previous studies have considered assimilation of downscaled passive microwave soil moisture and these studies have tended to focus on assimilation passive microwave soil moisture downscaled to 1 km resolution only however the impact of spatial resolutions of downscaled passive microwave soil moisture products to range of spatial resolutions e g 1 3 and 9 km on the accuracy of model streamflow simulation in relation to watershed size and frequency of updating needs further investigation thus distinctively from previous studies the objective of this study is to evaluate the utility of the original i e 36 km and downscaled passive microwave soil moisture products to a range of spatial resolutions i e 1 3 and 9 km in improving streamflow simulation for two contrasting watersheds mainly in terms of size 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the susquehanna watershed and its head sub watershed i e the upper susquehanna are located in the northeastern part of the united states covering half the land area of pennsylvania and parts of new york and maryland states ray et al 2016 both are characterized by humid continental mild summer with wet all year climate dfb class according to köppen trewartha climate classification belda et al 2014 the susquehanna watershed has a drainage area of 71 255 km2 the susquehanna river exits from otsego lake in cooperstown new york and travels about 715 km to chesapeake bay its average annual precipitation varies between 800 and 1250 mm whereas the mean annual temperature for the northern and the southern portion of the watershed is 6 and 12 oc respectively dephilip and moberg 2010 the dominant land cover is forest 55 followed by agriculture and pasture 33 peak streamflow occurs during the spring season because of the collective effect of snowmelt and rainfall whereas low flow is usually experienced in late summer and early fall its elevation varies between 4 and 1150 m on the other hand the upper susquehanna watershed has a drainage area of 21 000 km2 and located in south central of new york and north of pennsylvania states dephilip and moberg 2010 it is characterized by a mixture of forest and farmland its average annual precipitation varies between 890 and 1270 mm whereas the mean annual temperature for the northern and the southern portion of the watershed varies between 5 and 10 5 oc respectively maloney et al 2018 its peak and low streamflow occur during spring and late summer respectively its elevation varies between 150 and 800 m 2 2 description of data 2 2 1 the smap soil moisture products the smap level 3 soil moisture product l3smp version 7 with spatial resolution of 36 km was downloaded from the nasa national snow and ice data center distributed active archive center nsidc daac https nsidc org data smap accessed date 20 may 2021 in addition the downscaled smap to range of spatial resolutions including 1 3 and 9 km was used for downscaling we trained random forest machine learning technique using a range of predictors which have strong association with soil moisture such as land surface temperature lst normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and albedo derived from modis in addition topographic derivatives such as elevation slope and aspect were used the smap soil moisture was used as response variable and the training was carried out at resolution of smap i e 36 km the high resolution predictors were aggregated to this resolution during the training finally after verification of the model at coarse spatial resolution it was applied to the high resolution predictors to predict soil moisture at higher spatial resolutions hence for this study we downscaled the smap soil moisture from 36 km to 1 3 and 9 km in a nut shell the random forest machine learning technique used in here is a non parametric decision tree based ensemble learning breiman 2001 it has a great capability to represent the complex relationship between soil moisture and geophysical and atmospheric factors which have a strong association with soil moisture it is mainly based on bootstrap sampling bagging to randomly resample the training dataset into a set of subsamples with replacement each sample is then used to independently train each decision tree and the final anticipated value is obtained as an average of prediction of all decision trees for further details about our downscaling approach the reader can refer to our recent publication wakigari and leconte 2022 in this study the smap l3 soil moisture was selected based on our preliminary analysis by comparing the smap and smos soil moisture against in situ soil moisture as reference the smos tends to overestimate soil moisture over our study area in addition previous global validation studies have indicated the outperformance of the smap over our study region compared to smos amsr e and ascat soil moisture kim et al 2018 kumar et al 2018 ma et al 2019 moreover the original and downscaled smap soil moisture was validated with the existing in situ soil moisture and precipitation measurements in the susquehanna watershed however it is worth to note that the number of in situ soil moisture measurements are scarce in the susquehanna watershed fig 1 2 2 2 topography and land cover data topographic attributes such as elevation were extracted from nasa shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm dem it has 30 m spatial resolution and downloaded from the land processes distributed active archive center https lpdaac usgs gov accessed date 30 may 2021 similarly the latest version i e collection 6 of modis land cover mcd12q1 data for the year 2018 was used it has a resolution of 500 m and downloaded from the land processes distributed active archive center https lpdaac usgs gov accessed date 25 may 2021 2 2 3 hydrometeorological data daily surface precipitation and temperature i e maximum and minimum were collected from prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model daly et al 2008 which is a gridded dataset with a 4 4 km grid resolution produced from a set of in situ measurements across conus using terrain aware interpolation techniques it was developed by the prism climate group at oregon state university http www prism oregonstate edu the streamflow observations with daily temporal resolution were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs at gauge stations located at towanda 1 531 500 for the upper susquehanna watershed and harrisburg 1 570 500 for susquehanna watershed 2 2 4 ensemble meteorological data the ensemble of daily precipitation and temperature data was obtained from the ensemble meteorological dataset for planet earth em earth which is downloaded from federated research data repository frdr of canada https www frdr dfdr ca repo it is a recently developed global dataset consists of deterministic and probabilistic estimates of daily precipitation mean and range of daily temperature for historical period of 1950 2019 tang et al 2022 it has a spatial resolution of roughly 10 km em earth was produced following two sequential steps first the em earth deterministic estimate was produced by merging station based serially complete dataset with era 5 reanalysis and second the ensemble members were generated from merged data using spatiotemporally correlated random fields for further technical details about this data is available in tang et al 2022 in this study precipitation and maximum minimum temperature with an ensemble size of 25 members were used to drive a distributed hydrological model as em earth did not provide the maximum and minimum temperature they were estimated from the mean and range of daily temperature characteristics of all the data used are summarized in table 1 in the table the model setup refers feeding the model with all the necessary inputs including precipitation and temperature data stated in the table 1 followed by its calibration and validation with streamflow observation on the other hand ensemble simulations refers updating the calibrated and validated model with the smap soil moisture while forcing with ensemble precipitation and temperature 2 3 hydrological model description a continuous and physically based distributed hydrological model called hydrotel fortin et al 2001 was employed it is developed at institut national de la recherche scientifique inrs in quebec canada with aim of making good use of gis and to capitalize on remotely sensed data for simulation of hydrological processes fortin et al 2001 in watersheds with a variety of physiographic and hydroclimatic characteristics it is operationally in use at the quebec hydrological expertise centre a government organization which produces river forecasts in hydrotel the watershed is spatially discretized into relatively homogeneous hydrological units rhhu using physitel which is a gis framework specifically developed for hydrotel to spatially discretize the watershed based on river networks elevation land cover and soil types accordingly in this study the susquehanna watershed was discretized into 1025 rhhus the area of rhhus ranges between 0 5 and 450 km2 with an average area of 70 km2 about 59 rhhus have an area greater than 100 km2 whereas 41 of them have an area less than 100 km2 this model has six major modules and each one of them has several options of simulation with a range of complexity and data requirement table 2 soil moisture module i e the vertical water balance module is briefly described herein as this study focused on the integration of the smap soil moisture into the model an extensive description of the remaining modules can be found in fortin et al 2001 the vertical water balance module simulates vertical distribution of soil moisture in the soil profile there are two possible sub modules bv3c and cequeau in this study bv3c was employed the bv3c is a french abbreviation which stands for bilan vertical à 3 couches which can be translated as a three layer vertical water budget fortin et al 2001 jougla and leconte 2022 in bv3c the soil column is vertically discretized into three layers the first layer represents the top few centimeters typically 5 cm which is commensurate with the penetration depth of l band passive microwave remote sensing satellites such as smap this layer is used for partitioning of the rainfall and or snow melt into surface runoff and infiltration the second layer has a depth of 70 120 cm and is responsible for producing interflow whereas the third layer is often close to saturation with typical depth of 200 400 cm and it is responsible for producing baseflow the water exchange between these layers is controlled by the one dimensional richards equation 2 3 1 calibration and validation of hydrotel before incorporation of the smap soil moisture into soil moisture module the hydrotel model was calibrated using the dynamically dimensioned search dds tolson and shoemaker 2007 algorithm for historical time period of 1981 2006 using the observed streamflow separately both for susquehanna and upper susquehanna watersheds afterwards it was validated with streamflow for the period between 2007 and 2016 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was used as the objective function both calibration and validation were performed at a daily time step the performance of the model was evaluated using nse lognse gaur et al 2021 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 1998 the nse lognse and kge value ranges between and 1 nse lognse or kge value of 1 indicates a perfect model agreement between the simulated and observed streamflow i e ideal condition in general the higher the nse lognse and kge values the better the performance of the model and vice versa 2 4 experimental setup after evaluation of the robustness of the model through calibration and validation a simple data assimilation technique known as direct insertion technique walker et al 2001 was adopted for updating the hydrotel model with the smap soil moisture obtained for summer and early fall seasons may to october of the year 2018 in this study direct insertion involves replacing the model simulated soil moisture at each rhhu directly with the smap soil moisture it is worth to note that prior to replacing the simulated soil moisture the smap soil moisture was bias corrected to model simulated soil moisture using the cumulative distribution function matching approach cdf so that they could have similar climatology the direct insertion technique was deemed appropriate in this study compared to more complex assimilation techniques such as enkf as the main objective of this paper is to scrutinize the added value of smap derived soil moisture in a hydrological model for streamflow simulation in this study we used ingestion interchangeably with the direct insertion and it can be defined as a method of incorporating external observations e g in situ and satellite observations into hydrological model a suite of experiments was implemented by alternately updating the hydrotel model with different spatial resolutions of smap soil moisture including the original smap at 36 km and downscaled smap at 9 3 and 1 km resolutions the model was updated based on two approaches the first approach involves updating the model based on the availability of the smap soil moisture with full watershed coverage every 3 5 days followed by model propagation of soil moisture from surface soil to deeper layers until the next smap soil moisture observation becomes available putting differently the frequency of updating depends on the availability of smap soil moisture observations with full watershed coverage alternatively the second approach involves updating the model based on watershed averaged high rainfall events that could generate high streamflow events in this context the updating was carried out only prior to selected high rainfall events which is relevant in an operational flow forecasting environment in this approach the frequency of updating was low as there are only few events this approach was implemented to investigate whether varying the frequency of updating hence the duration of model propagation will impact on streamflow simulation the selection of high rainfall events was based on a simple graphical visualisation approach where the watershed averaged rainfall events are plotted along with the corresponding magnitude of streamflow in this context only those rainfall events which generated high streamflow events are selected visually in the end a non updated hydrotel model also known as open loop was forced with the ensemble of precipitation and temperature time series to generate ensemble streamflow and used as benchmark for comparison to other experiments fig 3 in another experiment in addition to the model s top layer its second layer was updated by using vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture the adopted vertical extrapolation method was based on a simple assumption that the model simulated surface soil moisture has strong relationship with deep layer soil moisture thus polynomial curve fitting was performed in order to establish an empirical relationship between model simulated surface and second layer soil moisture which then used to vertically extrapolate the smap surface soil moisture this experiment is meant to bypass the time the model takes to self adjust to new surface soil moisture observations i e model propagation of soil moisture from top to bottom layer here it is worthwhile to be aware that this assumption is not the best assumption as the surface and deep layer soil moisture response to precipitation varies in other words the lagging of root zone soil moisture behind surface soil moisture both in wetting and drying could affect the assumption in particular this assumption neglects potential surface subsurface soil moisture decoupling effects which can be significant in fine textured soils with low vegetated surfaces capehart and carlson 1997 however our intent is to give a general picture because of the paucity of in situ soil moisture over the susquehanna watershed to implement more robust method such as exponential filtering or machine learning techniques finally to investigate the relationship between the spatial resolutions of downscaled smap soil moisture and size of the watershed the model was run at the outlets of the susquehanna watershed and its upper sub watershed the susquehanna watershed was selected basically because of its large spatial extent with variety of land cover types and experience of floods thus investigation of the impact of pre storm soil moisture on the magnitude of flood in such watershed is deemed important in addition to the graphical framework in fig 2 the numerical experiments implemented in this study were summarized in table 3 the table shows two cases the first case involves updating the model top layer with the smap surface soil moisture at spatial resolutions of 1 3 9 and 36 km whereas the second case involves updating the model top and second layers with surface and vertically extrapolated smap with spatial resolutions of 1 3 9 and 36 km respectively in addition the two approaches of updating were considered updating when smap soil moisture with good quality is available and updating prior to high rainfall events these experiments were implemented both for the susquehanna and upper susquehanna watershed 2 4 1 evaluation of the benefit of updating the model with smap soil moisture the added value of direct insertion of the smap soil moisture in improving model performance for prediction of the ensemble streamflow simulation was estimated by means of the efficiency index eff the normalized root mean square error nrmse and the continuous ranked probability skill score crpss the eff measures the effect of ingestion with respect to the open loop run a positive eff value indicates improvement of ensemble streamflow simulation due to ingestion of the smap soil moisture whereas the negative value indicates deterioration 1 eff 1 t 1 t q up t q obs t 2 t 1 t q ol t q obs t 2 where qobs is observed streamflow q up and q ol mean of ensemble of simulated streamflow by the updated and non updated ol model respectively the nrmse represents the ratio of the root mean square error rmse between predicted ensemble streamflow after soil moisture ingestion and observed streamflow to the rmse of between the open loop ensemble and observed streamflow it provides information about the ensemble spread and the ensemble mean performance its value greater than 1 indicates the deterioration of the results where a value lower than 1 shows improvement 2 nrmse 1 n i 1 n t 1 t q up t q obs t 2 1 n i 1 n t 1 t q ol t q obs t 2 where n and t are ensemble size and length of time series considered in addition the continuous ranked probability skill score crpss is employed to assess the skill of the ensemble streamflow simulation its score varies between and 1 the score greater than zero indicates an improvement in the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations due to updating of the model with the smap soil moisture 3 crpss 1 crps updated crps non updated 4 crps 1 n i 1 n f i x f i 0 x 2 dx f 0 x 0 x observed streamflow value 1 x observed streamflow value where the crps is the continuous ranked probability score fi x is probability density function of the member of the ensemble simulation fi x is probability density function of observation the summer and early fall seasons of 2018 may october were selected for evaluation of the impact of ingestion of smap soil moisture on the ensemble streamflow simulations this is primarily because of better quality smap soil moisture during this period compared to the rest of the seasons i e winter and spring indeed in winter the soil is likely frozen near the surface whereas in the spring it is often affected by snowmelt on the other hand the selection of the year 2018 for the ingestion experiment was based on fact that it was one of the two wet years i e 2011 and 2018 in the decade 2010 2020 interestingly the smap mission also started providing soil moisture data during this decade put differently smap started providing soil moisture in 2015 which in turn makes the selection of the year 2018 more appropriate evidently the wet years result in wet soil moisture condition which in turn plays an important role in determining the magnitude of runoff thus focusing on such a year is deemed appropriate to see the impact of soil moisture ingestion on the accuracy of streamflow simulation 3 results 3 1 deterministic calibration and validation of hydrotel fig 3 displays a comparison of daily time series of observed and simulated streamflow at the outlet of the susquehanna watershed during calibration and validation periods the visual comparison indicates that both the timing and magnitude of simulated streamflow is in reasonable agreement with the observed streamflow apart from the underestimation or overestimation of some of the peak events besides the low flows are well reproduced by the model furthermore the statistical metrics confirmed good model performance in both calibration nse 0 81 lognse 0 69 and kge 0 76 and validation nse 0 78 lognse 0 63 and kge 0 74 similarly for the upper susquehanna watershed the nse kge values of 0 68 0 64 and 0 63 0 60 were obtained during calibration and validation respectively similarly the lognse values of 0 59 and 0 57 were obtained for calibration and validation respectively 3 2 downscaling of the smap soil moisture fig 4 shows an example of maps of the spatial distribution of the original smap soil moisture with resolution of 36 km and its downscaled version at 1 3 and 9 km for 17th of june 2018 the downscaled smap soil moisture at all spatial resolutions well reproduced the spatial patterns of their original counterpart for example the eastern and western parts of the watershed are characterized by wetter soil moisture conditions whereas the northern and southern parts are characterized by lower and medium range soil moisture respectively both for the original and downscaled versions in addition at higher spatial resolutions e g at 1 and 3 km the effect of land covers on the downscaled soil moisture is easily discernable this is a direct effect of including land cover related predictors in the downscaling algorithm such as the ndvi and lst in addition it can be inferred from the figure that the spatial details of the smap soil moisture is increased after downscaling fig 5 shows maps of spatial distribution of prism precipitation across the susquehanna watershed from june 13 to 16 inclusively as can be seen in the figure the lower part of the watershed is characterized by low precipitation especially on june 13th of 2018 whereas the northeastern and northwestern parts are characterized relatively by higher precipitation the next day june 14th the lower part of the watershed received high precipitation whereas the middle western part received precipitation with medium ranges during the remaining consecutive days the watershed almost did not receive precipitation overall the smap soil moisture displayed in fig 4 well responded to precipitation showed in fig 5 for example soil moisture in the western and northeastern parts are wet due to precipitation on june 13 and 14 of 2018 besides the spatial pattern comparisons the time series comparison of the original and downscaled smap soil moisture was also performed using the existing in situ soil moisture measurements fig 1 both the original and downscaled smap soil moisture well reproduced the temporal dynamics of in situ soil moisture at a location of the in situ measurements note that we did not show extensive validation results in this study as this was part of our previous work wakigari and leconte 2022 3 3 ingestion of smap soil moisture with different spatial resolutions this section presents the results of ingestion of the smap soil moisture into hydrotel model for the susquehanna watershed the top layer of the model was replaced with different spatial resolutions of smap soil moisture i e 1 3 9 and 36 km however only the results of the model updated by 36 and 1 km were presented in the figures to avoid over crowdedness but the performance metrics for all the resolutions are presented in tables 5 and 6 fig 6 displays the comparison of the ensemble streamflow simulations between the non updated i e open loop and updated model with the original 36 km and downscaled smap soil moisture 1 km for the susquehanna watershed as can be seen from the figure compared to the non updated model fig 6a updating of the model both with the original fig 6b and downscaled smap fig 6c soil moisture reduced the ensemble spread while keeping the observed streamflow within the simulated ensemble spread for example during the end of july and beginning of august the non updated model produced a large ensemble spread but after ingestion of the original and downscaled smap at 1 km the simulated ensemble peaks were reduced and matched well with the observation indeed the ensemble mean also shifted towards the observation and adequately captured its magnitude and timing when comparing among the different spatial resolutions ingestion of the 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture reduced the ensemble spread and improved the simulation of ensemble mean followed by the 3 and 9 km downscaled smap products and lastly by the original version of smap with resolution of 36 km corresponding statistical metrics are presented in table 5 on the other hand ingestion of the original smap i e 36 km and 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture did not lead to significant differences in simulating peak and low flows except for a few peak flows for example ingestion of the 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture tends to underestimate peak flow near mid september while the ingestion of 36 km smap soil moisture was able to capture 3 4 updating the model intermediate soil layer this section presents the results of ingestion of the vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture into hydrotel model for the susquehanna watershed the top and second layers of the model were replaced with different spatial resolutions of smap soil moisture i e 1 3 9 and 36 km however only the results of the model updated by 36 and 1 km were presented in the figures to avoid over crowdedness but the performance metrics for all the resolutions are presented in table 5 the soil moisture in the intermediate i e the second layer layer plays an important role in the runoff generation brocca et al 2010 in this experiment besides the top layer of the model the vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture was used to update the second layer of the hydrotel model which has thickness of about 70 cm fig 7 shows the comparison of the ensemble streamflow simulations between the non updated and the updated model with both surface and vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture compared to the non updated model fig 7a the ingestion of both surface and vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture into model s top and second layers respectively reduced the ensemble spread and moved the ensemble mean closely to observation both for the cases of the original fig 7b and downscaled smap at 1 km fig 7c when comparing among the smap spatial resolutions the ingestion of the 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture showed better results than the original smap for example the ensemble mean of the updated model with the downscaled smap at 1 km closely matches the observed streamflow than when updating the model with the original smap fig 7 similarly the spread of the ensemble is slightly lower for the downscaled smap at 1 km generally the 1 km downscaled smap is more effective in improving the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations followed by the 3 9 and 36 km smap resolutions respectively comparing the results of updating only the top layer of the model fig 6 with the updating both the top and second layers fig 7 the latter agrees well with the observation notably when the 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture is ingested for example in fig 6c the ensemble underestimated the observed streamflow peak near the end of july but after updating both top and second layers the ensemble well captured the observed peak as can be seen in fig 7c 3 5 updating the model at different frequencies this section presents the results of the impact frequency of updating of the model on its prediction the model was updated based on the watershed averaged high rainfall events fig 8 prior to a runoff event in contrast to the previous sections where the updating of the model was based on the availability of smap soil moisture with full watershed coverage as can be seen in the fig 8 about 10 rainfall events which produced high streamflow events were selected of which three are very high i e end of august mid august and mid september the plotted histogram represents time series of watershed averaged precipitation whereas the blue line indicates the observed streamflow at the outlet of the susquehanna watershed it is worth noting that this approach reduces the frequency of updating compared to the updating when the smap soil moisture with full watershed coverage is available in other words the model was left to propagate the soil moisture information over longer periods of time between successive updating times the model updating dates are presented in table 4 and also indicated in fig 8 by vertical black dashed lines fig 9 shows comparison of the ensemble streamflow simulations of the non updated and updated model with the 1 km downscaled and original smap surface soil moisture prior to the selected rainfall events fig 8 the updating was made for the top layer of the model for the susquehanna watershed after updating the model the spread of the ensemble is reduced and mean of the ensemble members closely matches the observation a visual comparison between the results of updating the model based on high rainfall events fig 9 and updating of the model based on the availability of smap soil moisture fig 6 shows no apparent differences besides the visual interpretations table 5 summarizes the statistical performance of all the experiments implemented in this study for the susquehanna watershed the statistical metrics generally indicated the outperformance of the updated model for all the smap resolutions compared to the non updated model however the degree of accuracy varies with the spatial resolution ingested into the model for example updating with the 1 km downscaled smap surface soil moisture showed better performance eff 87 30 m3 s nrmse 0 81 and crpss 0 17 compared to updating with the original version of smap surface soil moisture with resolution of 36 km eff 66 03 m3 s nrmse 0 85 and crpss 0 10 similarly the 3 and 9 km spatial resolution generally have performance better than the original resolution of smap however downscaling to higher spatial resolution such as 1 and 3 km did not bring significant improvements as shown in table 5 when comparing the model updated with the smap surface soil moisture with the one updated with both surface and vertically extrapolated smap the latter demonstrated a slightly better performance than the former in terms of eff for the 1 and 3 km resolution however the nrmse almost remain the same for all the resolutions and crpss is reduced for all the resolutions as shown in table 5 similarly when considering surface soil moisture only the high rainfall events based updating generally improved the model performance for all the resolutions of smap soil moisture than when updating based on the availability of smap surface soil moisture for example updating the model with the 1 km downscaled smap surface soil moisture based on high rainfall events increased eff from 87 30 m3 s to 99 50 m3 s reduced nrmse from 0 81 to 0 77 and increased the crpss from 0 17 to 0 24 3 6 updating the model at subbasin scale an additional experiment was also implemented to investigate if the spatial resolution of smap soil moisture is related with the watershed size to examine this the ingestion of the smap surface soil moisture was carried out at sub watershed scale i e the upper susquehanna sub watershed and compared with the results obtained in the previous sections for the susquehanna watershed fig 10 shows the ensemble streamflow simulations by the non updated and updated model with the original and downscaled smap surface soil moisture at 1 km for the upper susquehanna watershed compared to the non updated model fig 10a the updated model with the smap soil moisture at both spatial resolutions reduced the ensemble spread while keeping the ensemble mean closer to the observation when comparing between the 1 km and original smap soil moisture for example during mid august and end of september the spread of the ensemble further lowered when ingesting the 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture fig 10b than the original smap with resolution of 36 km fig 10c likewise the ensemble mean agrees well with observed streamflow for the 1 km downscaled smap than the original smap these results are comparable to those obtained over the entire susquehanna watershed table 6 presents the comparison of the performances of ingestion of the smap soil moisture at watershed and sub watershed scales at both scales the ingestion of the smap soil moisture at all spatial resolutions improved the performance of the model as indicated by the nrmse value less than one the eff and crpss values greater than zero table 6 interestingly the ingestion of the 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture shows more improvement at sub watershed scale with eff nrmse and crpss values of 97 90 0 72 and 0 21 respectively than at watershed scale with eff nrmse and crpss values of 87 30 0 81 and 0 17 respectively model improvement is also noted at 3 km resolution on the upper susquehanna but to a lesser extent than at 1 km likewise the ingestion of the 1 km vertically extrapolated downscaled smap soil moisture shows significant improvement at the sub watershed scale than at the watershed scale as can be seen in the table 6 4 discussion 4 1 ingestion of the smap soil moisture updating of the model through direct insertion of the smap soil moisture at all the spatial resolutions resulted in a considerable improvement in the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations compared to the non updated model i e open loop see table 5 however the degree of improvement varies depending on the spatial resolution of the inserted smap soil moisture for example for the susquehanna watershed ingestion of the 9 km downscaled smap soil moisture showed slightly better accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations with eff nrmse and crpss values of 92 89 0 80 and 0 17 respectively compared to ingestion of the 1 km 3 km downscaled smap soil moisture with eff nrmse and crpss values of 87 30 91 5 0 81 0 80 and 0 17 0 16 respectively this indicates that downscaling to higher spatial resolutions e g 1 and 3 km is not that much important as the 9 km downscaled smap adequately represent the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture for a large watershed like the susquehanna the downscaling of the smap soil moisture generally improved the representation of spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture and this heterogeneity is heavily dependent on the complex interaction of intertwined geophysical and atmospheric factors such as soil properties topography vegetation and meteorological forcing crow et al 2012 however the effect of these factors varies based on the spatial scale for example at larger scale the meteorological forcing plays an important role whereas at finer scale topography and soil properties such as texture become more crucial western et al 2002 this insight supports the importance of downscaling the coarse resolution smap soil moisture products to higher spatial resolutions in order to capture soil moisture spatial variability at finer scale indeed possibly for this reason the downscaled smap at all resolutions gave better results than the original smap soil moisture however because of the large size of the susquehanna watershed downscaled smap at 9 km adequately represented the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture in the watershed thereby substantially improving the streamflow simulation and reducing the importance of going to higher spatial resolutions i e 1 and 3 km as there is no further improvement in the accuracy of ensemble streamflow simulation as shown in table 5 on the other hand the size of model rhhus varies between 0 5 and 450 km2 and the average rhhus size is 70 km2 which is comparable with the area of the 9 km downscaled smap soil moisture i e 9 km 9 km 81 km2 besides the large size of susquehanna watershed the size of rhhus confirms why going to higher spatial resolution of smap is not that important as high spatial resolution smap soil moisture aggregates back to the size of rhhus differently from previous studies such as that of abbaszadeh et al 2020 which focused on assimilation of smap at 1 and 36 km for the watershed with area of roughly 2577 km2 our study updated the model with the smap soil moisture with the range resolutions including 1 3 9 and 36 km for a large watershed with area of 71000 km2 nevertheless their results are in line with our finding showing improvement in the model prediction of streamflow after assimilation of the downscaled smap at 1 km compared to its original version with resolution of 36 km similarly le et al 2022 found improvement in the accuracy streamflow simulation after assimilation of the smap enhanced soil moisture 9 km and its downscaled version at 1 km into swat model they reported significant improvement in the accuracy streamflow simulation when the downscaled smap at 1 km assimilated for eight watersheds with area ranging from 267 to 6430 km2 in general our study area is roughly 10 20 times larger than the study areas of abbaszadeh et al 2020 and le et al 2022 which suggested that for our case the downscaled smap at coarser resolution i e 9 km is adequate enough for simulation of accurate streamflow as mentioned previously in the context of the ongoing controversy regarding the usefulness satellite soil moisture our study supports those studies that found the effectiveness of satellite soil moisture in improving the accuracy of model prediction abbaszadeh et al 2020 azimi et al 2020 brocca et al 2012 le et al 2022 loizu et al 2018a this is because in our study the insertion of the smap soil moisture both at its original and downscaled resolutions showed considerable improvement in the ensemble streamflow simulation when compared to the non updated model this study also demonstrated the effectiveness of a simple direct insertion technique for the ingestion of the smap soil moisture this technique is simple and could be computationally faster than those used in many soil moisture ingestion studies such as the ensemble kalman filter azimi et al 2020 lievens et al 2015 loizu et al 2018b particle filtering technique abbaszadeh et al 2020 and a smoothing framework crow and ryu 2009 it is also worth noting that this study did not use the existing high resolution smap soil moisture products this is primarily because of the low temporal resolution of these products for example the 1 and 3 km existing smap sentinel 1 soil moisture products have temporal resolution of 12 days over the susquehanna watershed whereas the downscaled smap products in this study have temporal resolution of 2 3 days similarly the existing 9 km smap enhanced soil moisture did not show significant difference compared to smap l3 36 km in terms of portraying spatial detail of soil moisture wakigari and leconte 2022 this is primarily because it was simply generated using mathematical interpolation i e backus gilbert optimal interpolation from smap l3 whereas our downscaled products shows more detailed soil moisture information as our downscaling approach based on the use of high resolution land surface variables which have strong association with soil moisture 4 2 the effect of ingestion rootzone soil moisture soil moisture at deeper depths has a strong impact on runoff generation brocca et al 2012 in this study the ingestion of the vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture further improved the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow prediction when compared to the ingestion smap surface soil moisture only however the improvement is not that significant for example the nrmse is only reduced by 0 01 for the 9 and 1 km resolutions whereas for the 3 and 36 km there is no change the eff values are moderately increased notably for the 3 and 1 km however the crpss values are reduced for all the smap resolutions see table 5 this inconsistency in improving the model performance among the inserted resolutions of the smap soil moisture could be attributed to the simple empirical polynomial fitting approach adopted for the vertical extrapolation of the smap surface soil moisture this approach has no strong physical basis as opposed to those used in the previous studies such as the exponential filter albergel et al 2008 brocca et al 2012 in addition the paucity of in situ soil moisture measurements in the study area impedes the validation of the proposed method in addition the model performance might be affected by model subsurface physics as it is not explicitly designed take into account the coupling between the top and second layers of the model compared to previous studies such as the one by brocca et al 2012 which reported marked improvement in the model performance after assimilation of the vertically extrapolated ascat soil moisture our study found only slight improvement after updating the second layer of the model with the vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture this is because besides the difference in the extrapolation method used as stated above part of this inconsistency could be attributed to the difference in physiographic characteristics between the study watersheds our study watershed is large and dominated by forest where there could be strong vertical coupling between the top and second layers compared that of brocca et al 2012 which is small watershed with area of 137 km2 and mainly covered with woods and croplands thus in our study updating the second layer of the model might add water to the system thereby upsetting the water balance and resulting in only slight improvement in the streamflow prediction compared to updating the top layer only 4 3 the effect of frequency of updating as stated previously in the present study two approaches were adopted to update the model in the first one the model was updated based on the availability of the smap soil moisture with the full watershed coverage whereas in the second approach the model was updated based on the expected high rainfall events in the second approach the frequency of updating was reduced since there are only a few high rainfall events the decrease in the frequency of updating in the second approach further improved the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulation compared to the first approach for example for the susquehanna watershed ingestion of the 9 km downscaled smap into a model based on high rainfall events shows better accuracy with eff nrmse and crpss values of 98 73 0 78 and 0 21 respectively than when model updated based on the availability of smap which has eff nrmse and crpss values of 92 89 0 80 and 0 17 respectively similarly for the 1 km downscaled smap eff increased from 87 30 to 99 50 nrmse decreased from 0 81 to 0 77 and crpss increased from 0 17 to 0 24 when the model updated based on high rainfall events compared to updating based on the availability of smap this improvement could be explained by the fact that the reduction in the frequency of updating provides more time for the ingested smap soil moisture to adjust itself to the ambient conditions during the time between two successive events besides the frequency of updating could be affected by the smap soil moisture retrieval quality which in turn could affect the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations this simply means that the model performance possibly benefited from reducing the frequency of updating because the quality of the smap soil moisture might not be as optimal as it should be this is primarily because of the presence of vegetation over the susquehanna watershed which affects the retrieval quality of the smap wakigari and leconte 2022 when it comes to updating based on the availability of smap soil moisture this study is in line with those of abbaszadeh et al 2020 jadidoleslam et al 2021 and le et al 2022 who also reported improvement in model performance however with regard to updating based on high rainfall events our finding disagrees with the finding of azimi et al 2020 who reported decrease in model performance after reducing the model updating frequency with the ascat soil moisture for two small watersheds i e niccone 137 km2 and chiascio 165 km2 of the upper tiber river basin italy 4 4 the impact of watershed size this study demonstrated that for the larger watershed i e the susquehanna watershed the ingestion of the original resolution smap i e 36 km or downscaled smap surface soil moisture at coarser spatial resolutions e g 9 km per se improved the ensemble streamflow simulations without the need to go to higher spatial resolutions for example ingestion of the 9 km downscaled smap soil moisture had slightly better accuracy with eff nrmse and crpss values of 92 89 0 80 and 0 17 respectively compared to ingestion of the 1 km downscaled smap with eff nrmse and crpss values of 87 30 0 81 and 0 17 respectively this is because the susquehanna watershed is large in size and could be covered by a large number of pixels of the original or the 9 km downscaled smap this in turn allows to adequately characterize the spatial variability of soil moisture in relation to runoff generation without the requirement of downscaling the smap to higher spatial resolutions e g 1 and 3 km on the other hand for the upper susquehanna watershed the 1 and 3 km downscaled smap soil moisture markedly improved the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulation for example ingestion of the 1 km downscaled smap soil moisture showed better accuracy with eff nrmse and crpss values of 97 90 0 72 and 0 21 respectively compared to ingestion of the 9 km smap soil moisture with eff nrmse and crpss values 90 30 0 74 and 0 16 respectively this is primarily because the 1 km downscaled smap better represent the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture for this watershed than the downscaled smap at 9 km for example about 19 440 pixels of the 1 km downscaled smap cover the upper susquehanna watershed whereas about 15 and 240 pixels are required for the 36 and 9 km smap respectively overall the 1 km downscaled smap is hydrologically more commensurable with the size of the upper susquehanna watershed whereas the 9 and 36 km are not sufficient enough to describe the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture and its impact on watershed behavior this is why downscaling to higher spatial resolution is important for the upper susquehanna watershed similar results were reported by le et al 2022 through the ingestion of the smap enhanced soil moisture 9 km and its downscaled version at 1 km resolution for streamflow simulation in eight catchments with a range of areas from 267 to 6430 km2 across tropical vietnam they found that the benefit of downscaled smap at 1 km is more pronounced for streamflow simulation in the smaller watersheds this is consistent with our study which revealed that the 1 km downscaled smap relative to the original smap improved the ensemble streamflow simulation notably for the upper susquehanna watershed in general for the smaller watershed going to higher spatial resolution is important to adequately characterize the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture and its impact on hydrological processes yet for the larger watershed going to higher spatial resolutions does not seem to offer significant benefits while increasing computational workload this because for the larger watershed spatial heterogeneity tend to decrease with the watershed size asano and uchida 2010 5 conclusions over the last decades the availability of spatially distributed remotely sensed observations of near surface soil moisture has been growing this has sparked interest in the incorporation of these observations into distributed hydrological models hence this study was designed to ingest the smap soil moisture with a range of spatial resolutions from 1 to 36 km into a distributed hydrological model called hydrotel using a direct insertion technique a set of experiments was carried out to evaluate the impact of vertical extrapolation frequency of updating and spatial resolution on simulation of the ensemble streamflow for two contrasting watersheds i e the susquehanna and one of its head sub watersheds the upper susquehanna watershed mainly in terms of size the results showed that the ingestion of the smap soil moisture at all the spatial resolutions i e 1 3 9 and 36 km improved the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations in the susquehanna watershed when comparing the impact of spatial resolution of the smap soil moisture on the accuracy of ensemble streamflow simulations the direct insertion of the 9 km downscaled smap soil moisture showed better accuracy and going to higher resolution did not result in further improvement as the root zone soil moisture plays an essential role in the runoff generation the present study vertically extrapolated the smap surface soil moisture to deep layer and ingested into the hydrotel model the results demonstrated that the insertion of the vertically extrapolated smap soil moisture only slightly further improved the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations compared to the insertion of smap surface soil moisture only this could be partly attributed to the simplicity of the assumption adopted subsurface physics of the model physiographic characteristics of the watershed e g soil type and land cover and lack of the in situ soil moisture data for validation of the adopted extrapolation approach the finding of this study also demonstrated that the direct insertion of the smap soil moisture based on the expected high rainfall events reduced the frequency of updating which in turn slightly increased the accuracy of the ensemble streamflow simulations and lowered the computational time compared to the updating based on the availability smap soil moisture this is because reducing the frequency of updating offers more time for soil moisture to propagate to the rootzone between two subsequent updating times with regards to the impact of the watershed size the ensemble streamflow simulation at sub watershed scale was more benefited from the 1 and 3 km downscaled smap soil moisture than the original 36 km or downscaled smap at coarse spatial resolution 9 km for the susquehanna watershed which is larger in size i e 71 000 km2 the downscaled smap soil moisture at coarse spatial resolutions could be sufficient for the optimum streamflow simulation yet for the upper susquehanna watershed with area of 20 000 km2 the downscaled smap at higher spatial resolutions i e 1 or 3 km is important to properly describe the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture it is worth to mention that above half our study area is forested which in turn affected the quality of the smap soil moisture retrieval indeed the assimilation of the sub optimal quality smap soil moisture retrieval over such an area can have impact on the accuracy of the simulated streamflow our study did not investigate this issue which should be addressed particularly in the context of operational streamflow forecasting in future studies one could also compare the simple direct insertion technique adopted in the present study with computationally demanding techniques such as the ensemble kalman filter and particle filter and improving the model subsurface physics for data assimilation could be an interesting research topic the studies which use the ensemble of the actual weather forecast data in conjunction with assimilation of satellite soil moisture products for the operational streamflow forecast is also encouraged finally studies on the comparison of the assimilation of different satellite soil moisture products passive and active microwave remote sensing could be interesting for identifying the most suitable product for a given watershed credit

well as the effects of various natural and anthropogenic factors on them new hydrological insights for the region stations located downstream of nuclear power plants showed an anomalous increase in tw not consistent with the river section where they are located with higher values in the lower flow months august to december the stations affected by the main reservoirs along the ebro river showed a lower annual temperature range and the stations located in large irrigation systems showed a lower summer temperature compared to other stations with similar climatic conditions finally there was a significant annual increase in tw at all stations mean tw 0 05 c year except those located at the head of the tributaries these trends were higher for the stations downstream of the ascó nuclear power plant tw 0 08 c year seasonally the spring months showed the greatest changes with higher increases at the stations downstream of ascó tw 0 10 c year the increase in air temperature associated with global warming and the decrease in flows associated with the increase in water consumption resulted in an increase in the temperature of the river graphical abstract ga1 keywords water temperature

and was retrieved from publicly available data sources 1 introduction water temperature tw is an important parameter in river systems influencing all physical chemical and biological processes occurring in the water stevens et al 1975 it is also an important variable affecting water quality regarding industrial water supply refrigeration systems and recreational uses high water temperature

the natural factors while return flows from human activities such as industrial uses mainly refrigeration irrigation or climate and land use changes are some of the anthropogenic factors water

among species schmidt nielsen 1997 garcía de jalón 1996 garcía de jalon et al 1988 ward and stanford 1982 vannote and sweeney 1980 nebeker 1971 water temperature also affects water composition through its influence on mineral solubility and co₂ partial pressure stumm and morgan 1970 an increase in tw generally increases salt solubility and therefore water salinity catalán and catalán 1987 an analysis of the main mineral dissolution rates for the waters of the ebro river basin showed that tw and air temperature tₐ related to the co₂ partial pressure had a positive relationship with the number of calcite and dolomite saturated and oversaturated samples alberto and navas 1987 water temperature is also a conditioning factor for water ph with ph decreasing as tw increases labrador páez et al 2019 the ebro river basin authority confederación hidrográfica del ebro che has monitored tw as a possible cause of water acidification trends che 2012 and found a general upward trend in water acidification and in tw in many control points of the rivers related to the atmospheric emissions of thermal power plants dissolved oxygen do an important factor for aquatic life is determined by tw as cold water can hold more dissolved oxygen than warm water stevens et al 1975 higher tw may also enhance organism metabolism leading to enhanced oxygen consumption and decreasing do this alteration can contribute to anoxia events in deep rivers with low water velocity prats 2011 or to the profusion of macrophytes in stretches downstream of major reservoirs where minimum flows are quite constant garcía vera 2013 in this regard the che has implemented a water temperature depth profile control network throughout reservoirs in the ebro river basin to prevent eutrophication and to study water stratification che 2018 water temperature is controlled primarily by climatic and geographic factors such as annual and daily solar radiation cycles contribution from snowmelt or river altitude many of these factors such as rainfall temperature or snowmelt patterns can be affected by climate variability in general a higher altitude entails a lower average and lower annual range of tw arrúe and alberto 1986 other natural drivers of tw in a river stretch are groundwater discharge including thermal springs flow velocity channel characteristics and storage capacity riparian area and inputs from tributaries poole and berman 2001 human effects on tw are normally derived from riparian and land use changes channel alterations and discharges either directly to the main stem or through tributaries the most important anthropogenic drivers of tw are water storage in reservoirs and river regulation webb 1996 webb and walling 1988 discharges from nuclear or thermal power plants peterson and jaske 1968 urban and industrial discharges kinouchi et al 2007 river channeling and riparian modifications poole and berman 2001 irrigation return flows verma 1986 and changes in land uses or water diversions beschta and taylor 1988 climate change is also an anthropogenic driver of tw trends it can affect tw in a different fashion either through changes in air temperature or in precipitation amount and intensity of the rainfall and the type of precipitation rain or snow during the last century tₐ increased over most of the ebro river basin with an average increase of 0 2 c per decade in the 1950 2006 period de castro et al 2005 and a higher summer increase up to 0 34 c per decade lópez moreno et al 2011 land use changes also contribute to alterations in the flow regime gusarov 2019 fazel et al 2017 and thus of tw álvarez cabria et al 2016 alterations in the natural thermal regime of rivers have been found worldwide the european environmental agency eea reported an increase in tw of 1 3 c in the major european rivers over the last century eea 2017 for instance the mean tw increased by 1 c in the danube river during the last century and by 3 c in the lower reaches of the rhine river between 1910 and 2010 the tw increase in the rhine river was attributed mainly to the increase in water use for cooling with one third attributed to the increase in tₐ as a result of climate change eea 2017 the main stretch of the danube river in austria showed an increase of 0 8 1 0 c in the 1901 1990 period with the highest value 2 0 c in october and november webb and nobilis 1995 part of this increase was associated with heated effluents and regulation and with the climate patterns of the north atlantic oscillation webb and nobilis 2007 other studies in the usa showed an increase of 0 009 0 077 c year in 20 major streams and rivers kaushal et al 2010 with higher trends in summer months seven unregulated rivers in the northwestern usa showed a summer increase of 0 22 c per decade for the 1980 2009 period in which the dominant driving factor was the observed increase in tₐ isaak et al 2011 except for some general studies in the 1980 s arrúe and alberto 1986 alberto and arrúe 1986 most studies on the tw of the ebro river basin have focused either on the effects of anthropogenic alterations on tw or on the effects of tw on river ecosystems val et al 2016 garcía de jalón 1996 garcía de jalón et al 1988 most of the latter studies have generally addressed the effects of reservoirs and discharges from the ascó nuclear power plant in the lower reach of the ebro river arbat bofill et al 2014 prats 2012 prats et al 2010 val et al 2003 dolz et al 1996 other studies have analyzed the trends of tw along with other water quality parameters using different statistical tools abaurrea et al 2011 valencia 2007 bouza 2006 or have even developed models for the creation of tw scenarios val et al 2018 thus there has been a lack of specific studies on the temporal and spatial variability of tw in the ebro river basin that incorporate the river as a continuous system the few analyses available on tw trends did not incorporate long and complete data series diamantini et al 2018 bouza deaño et al 2008 furthermore the ebro river basin authority has been recording tw since 1972 at the main water quality monitoring stations along the ebro river and its main tributaries che 2021a this 40 year long series offers a good opportunity to analyze the behavior of tw in a global context including spatial distribution seasonal patterns and long term trends the objectives of this paper are i to assess the thermal regime of the ebro river and its main tributaries over a 40 year period ii to establish the trends in surface water temperatures in the ebro river basin and iii to search for patterns in the thermal regime and especially water temperature trends and their potential link to natural factors or anthropogenic drivers such as water diversion power plants cooling urban and agricultural discharges or land use changes this is necessarily a preliminary analysis as it only addresses the course and main tributaries of the ebro river and does not incorporate long term detailed information on land uses and water diversion however it may be used as a starting point for establishing the links between climate variability global warming and land use changes with tw providing frameworks for analyzing future scenarios of water and land use and climate change on tw both directly and through diminished water resources 2 materials

characterized by a dry mediterranean continental climate with low and discontinuous precipitation 350 700 mm year and a mean annual tₐ of 11 14 c with an annual range of 17 20 c che 2022 the river source is in the cantabrian mountains at 880 m a s l extreme north west of the basin fig 1 and the river mouth is located on the mediterranean coast in the southeastern part of the basin the main tributaries of the ebro river are located on the left bank originating from the pyrenees and include the aragón arga natural flow 4145 mm³ year and cinca segre 5423 mm³ year river systems fig 1 which account for 62 of the total flow of the ebro river data for 1980 2017 che 2022 the inflows from the right bank amount to only 5 of the total flow batalla et al 2004 the ebro river flow regime is influenced accordingly by the left bank tributaries with a contribution of snowmelt in the late spring season that represents 6 of the total water supply of the ebro river basin magrama 2008 the maximum natural flow for these pluvio nival or nivo pluvial tributaries occur in the late spring months or even summer months bejarano et al 2010 masachs 1948 on the other hand the ebro river natural flow presents a pluvial regime influenced in the middle lower reaches by the nivo pluvial regime of the left bank tributaries masachs 1948 and is characterized by long periods of maximum flows during winter and spring bejarano et al 2010 the mean annual flow shows a significant decreasing trend in the river tributaries between 1 for the aragón arga river and 3 for the cinca segre river lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 1945 2005 the flow at the last gauging station was 2747 mm³ year for the aragón arga river and 3724 mm³ year for the cinca segre river from 1980 81 2017 18 magrama 2021 the ebro river shows the same behavior the mean annual flow for the final gauging station at tortosa was 9087 mm³ year in the same period 31 lower than the historic average of 13 087 mm³ year 1912 13 2017 18 magrama 2021 showing a significant decreasing trend of 2 9 m³ s per year lorenzo gonzález et al 2014 irrigated agriculture is the main water user in the ebro river basin accounting for 92 2 of the total diversions che 2022 the irrigated area has been increasing steadily in recent years and reaches almost 924 000 ha 11 of the total surface with a current demand estimated at 8141 mm³ year che 2022 the irrigated surface is particularly important in the cinca segre river basin with 371 000 ha 16 of the total basin in the arba river basin with 60 000 ha 28 and less important in the aragón arga river basins with 64 700 ha 7 elaborated using data from che 2022 the diversions for urban 483 mm³ year and industrial 208 mm³ year uses are much lower che 2022 there are some reservoirs and several weirs along the main stem used for diverting water for irrigation the ebro reservoir storage capacity of 540 mm³ is located in the ebro river headwaters and is managed mainly for regulation fig 1 the lower reaches of the main stem are dominated by the mequinenza reservoir 1534 mm³ for hydropower generation upstream of the confluence of the cinca segre and the smaller ribarroja and flix reservoirs downstream also for hydropower generation fig 1 other important reservoirs are located on the pyrenean tributaries yesa reservoir with 476 mm³ and itoiz reservoir with 418 mm³ on the aragón river basin el grado mediano system on the cinca river with 835 mm³ canelles santa ana system with 915 mm³ and rialb reservoir with 403 mm³ in the segre river basin these reservoirs supply water for

nuclear power plants npps fig 1 along the ebro river the garoña npp located in the upper reaches of the ebro river was active from march 1971 to december 2012 with an annual mean output of 3800 gwh nuclenor 2013 the garoña npp did not have refrigeration towers and discharged to the sobrón reservoir 20 mm³ the ascó npp is located in the lower reaches of the ebro river it has been fully active since march 1986 with two reactors ascó i and ascó ii the ascó npp has a mean annual output of 15 000 gwh coll et al 1996 anav 2012 and its refrigeration effluent is discharged directly to the ebro river downstream of the flix reservoir after flowing through a refrigeration tower built in 1995 the ascó npp has a 77 m³ s water allowance for refrigeration and another 29 m³ s for thermal dilution che 2008 finally the main cities along the ebro river zaragoza population 680 000 and logroño population 154 000 and to a lesser extent miranda de ebro population 38 000 in the upper reach and their surrounding industrial areas may be another source of thermal affection fig 1 the effluents of another four cities may affect the tw in some left bank tributaries lleida population 138 000 on the

quality control network swq of the ebro river basin was created by the che and started collecting monthly tw data in 1972 73 mopu 1990 the network started with 22 monitoring stations and today the number of stations in the network has increased to more than 500 che 2021a twenty one swq stations were selected on the ebro river and its main tributaries for this study 14 on the ebro river and 7 on the main tributaries from each station the instant monthly data of tw tₐ che 2021a mopu 1990 the flow at the time of measurement qᵢ che 2021a mopu 1990 and the mean monthly flow qₘ magrama 2021 were retrieved one data point per month both tw and tₐ series were screened and the values that were deemed blunt errors were eliminated the sampling frequency was reduced in 2012 from monthly to quarterly and thus the data analyzed in this work correspond to monthly data in the 40 year period from october 1973 to september 2012 missing 8 years with a strong increase in air temperature from 2012 to 2020 the information from 2012 to 2022 was not included to avoid spurious influences in the establishment of trends for months with missing data there were two important factors in the selection of the stations long and reasonably complete data series and the plausibility of the stations to be affected by the main temperature drivers in the ebro river basin thus they were located downstream of nuclear power plants regulated reaches reservoirs and main irrigation areas or on the main tributaries table 1 fig 1 data series at some stations were not complete table 1 thus the period from october 1975 to september 2008 was selected to compare the behavior of tw throughout the year at all stations while the trends were analyzed with the longest series available at each station two stations were selected in the headwaters of the aragón aragón jaca station 18 2 2 the number indicates the station id in the surface water quality control network swq and segre rivers segre seo station 23 presumably with little or no thermal effects and one in the headwaters of the ebro river ebro cereceda station 161 125 km downstream of the ebro reservoir the thermal conditions and their changes along the main tributaries were monitored with data from the arga peralta 4 aragón caparroso 5 aragón arga river system cinca fraga 17 segre serós 25 cinca segre river system and arba river tauste stations 60 in the upper reach of the main stem the ebro miranda station 1 is the first quality station downstream of the garoña npp and the ebro haro station 208 may also be affected by garoña npp effluent 48 km upstream whereas the ebro ascó 163 xerta 212 and tortosa 27 stations are located downstream of the ascó npp along the ebro river middle reaches the main thermal influences are diversions for irrigation ebro pignatelli 162 pina 211 and xerta 212 in addition influences due to inflows from tributaries ebro castejón 2 the stations in the lower ebro river reaches are also affected by the flow regulation of the mequinenza reservoir ebro mequinenza station 29 with two stations located downstream of the confluence of the cinca river on smaller reservoirs the ebro flix 210 and ebro ascó stations 163 table 1 finally 3 stations from the spanish meteorological agency aemet 2022 were selected to analyze monthly ta trends 9170 logroño 9434 zaragoza airport and 9981a tortosa these stations are the closest ones to 3 quality stations on the ebro river used in this work lodosa zaragoza and tortosa respectively and unlike the water quality stations they have very complete data series of mean daily tₐ from 1973 74 2011 12 2 3 statistical procedures 2 3 1 water temperature characterization the tw annual cycle was characterized through a harmonic equation fitted by regression on the number of months since the beginning of the time series n which also allowed for the calculation of the average trend 1 t w b 0 b 1 n c 1 sin n π 6 d 1 co s n π 6 c 2 sin n π 3 d 2 co s n π 3 where b₀ intercept of the regression is the tw the month prior to the beginning of the series n 0 and b₁ is the regression coefficient for n an estimate of the trend in c month with 12 measurements per year ck and dk are the regression coefficients of the transformed variables sin k n π 6 and cos k n π 6 which account for cycles with angular frequency ω 2 π k 12 k π 6 that is for cycles with a period t 1 k yr and frequency ν k yr 1 other higher and lower frequencies were tried but only the cycles with frequencies 1 and 2 periods of one year and six months respectively were significant p 0 05 in at least one of the transformed variables sine or cosine for all series while no other frequency showed significant coefficients thus only the harmonics of order two were fitted to all stations from the trigonometric identity 2 cos a b cos a cos b sin a sin b eq 1 can be rewritten as 3 t w b 0 b 1 n a 1 co s n π 6 φ 1 a 2 co s n π 3 φ 2 with 4 a k c k 2 d k 2 φ k arctan c k d k k 1 2 which allows for a more direct interpretation of the parameters ak and φk are the amplitude and phase angle of the wave of frequency k yr 1 respectively the phase angle in radians may be converted to months or days with 5 φ month 6 φ rad π φ day 365 25 φ rad 2 π with a positive negative sign indicating the days after before the observation for which n 0 or multiples of 12 when the cycle achieved its maximum the significance of the linear regression between estimated and measured tw values was used to indicate the goodness of the fit 2 3 2 relationships between tw and auxiliary variables the most important parameter controlling water temperature is tₐ a good or bad relationship between tₐ and tw points to a small or large influence of other factors and little or large thermal inertia at that location therefore in this study we used the simple linear regression of tw on tₐ to identify the stations where tₐ exerted a greater influence on tw 6 tw a b tₐ another parameter naturally related to tw is the flow thus we analyzed the relationship between tw and the mean monthly flow qₘ at each station we used qₘ instead of the instantaneous flow at the time of tw measurement qᵢ because the monthly flow series was far more complete a logarithmic equation was selected because it showed the best fit at all stations 7 tw a b ln qₘ 2 3 3 trend analysis two parametric regression methods linear regression of tw for each individual month and harmonic analysis and one nonparametric method seasonal kendall test along with the seasonal kendall slope estimator gilbert 1987 were used to detect and estimate trends in the original tw series 2 4 linear regression by month for a given month i the linear regression of the mean monthly temperature in that month twᵢ on the year y taken as 1 for the first year in each series 8 twᵢ aᵢ bᵢ y yields a slope bᵢ that can be regarded as the trend in tw over time expressed in c yr ¹ for month i the trends in a given month i were considered significant when the slopes bᵢ were significantly different from 0 p 0 05 the intercept ai yields the value of tw in month i of year 0 that is the year right before the beginning of the analyzed series 2 5 harmonic regression analysis in the harmonic regression eq 3 tw was fitted to two cosine waves plus a trend the regression coefficient b₁ in eq 3 yields the increase decrease in tw per month c month and can be taken as the linear trend in tw at each station the trend of tw at a given station was significant if the parameter b₁ was significantly different from 0 p 0 05 2 6 seasonal kendall slope estimator the nonparametric seasonal kendall test for trend hirsch et al 1982 was used to assess the presence of significant trends p 0 05 and the seasonal kendall slope estimator based on the sen median slope estimator was used to determine the trend in each month and for the whole year hirsch et al 1982 the homogeneity of the trends among months at each station was checked using a χ2 test p 0 05 gilbert 1987 the mann kendall method mann 1945 kendall 1975 was selected because it can be used for non complete data series and without any particular distribution gilbert 1987 this method is commonly used to analyze hydrometeorological and water quality trends of variables such as flow precipitation salinity or temperature webb and nobilis 1995 kaushal et al 2010 lópez moreno et al 2011 prats et al 2007 bouza 2006 3 results the harmonic equation presented a good adjustment in the 21 stations with a significant linear relation between estimated and observed tw values r² 0 782 0 927 table 2 there were many missing data in the tw series table 1 and in addition tw observations although with monthly frequency were taken randomly in day and hour within each month the harmonic equation fills tw monthly gaps and decreases the effects due to measurements in a non representative day hour therefore the values estimated by the harmonic equation were used to calculate annual and monthly tw averages the months of maximum and minimum tw and the range difference between the maximum and minimum monthly tw at the different stations table 2 3 1 water temperature patterns in the ebro river basin 3 1 1 ebro river longitudinal analysis annual and seasonal results 3 1 1 1 tw along the ebro river axis along the ebro river main stem the mean annual tw 1975 2008 increased by 4 6 c from the first upstream station at the ebro cereceda station to the last station at ebro tortosa resulting in an average gradient of 0 6 c 100 km however this increase was not homogeneous along the river fig 2 table 2 i in the upper reaches tw increased 2 8 c between the ebro cereceda upstream of the garoña npp and ebro miranda downstream of the npp stations separated by 90 km an average increase of 3 1 c 100 km ii flowing into the ebro depression tw decreased by 1 5 c along the 201 km stretch between the ebro miranda and ebro castejón stations with an average variation of 0 7 c km and a decrease in tw opposite to the natural river behavior increasing tw downstream the contribution of the large tributaries from the left bank aragón and arga with a flow higher than the ebro river in this stretch and with a lower tw 13 4 c for the aragón caparroso station and 13 5 c for the arga peralta station could explain the decrease in tw in the ebro river from 14 3 c at lodosa to 14 0 c at castejón iii in the lower middle reaches of the ebro depression the ebro river temperature rose at a rate of 0 5 c 100 km from castejón to mequinenza from the mequinenza reservoir tw 15 9 c to the flix dam tw 15 2 c tw decreased by 0 7 c due to the discharge from the cinca segre system with lower mean tw 14 6 c for the cinca fraga station and 14 8 c for the segre serós station iv finally in the lower reaches downstream of the ascó npp the tw increased 1 9 c between the ebro flix 15 2 c and ebro ascó 17 1 c stations 4 5 c 100 km and remained high tw 17 c to the river mouth ebro tortosa station 3 1 1 2 annual range of tw along the ebro river axis the temperature range difference between the maximum and the minimum mean monthly tw increased steadily from the ebro cereceda 14 3 c station to the ebro pina 16 3 c station at a rate of 0 5 c 100 km fig 2 downstream of the ebro pina station this range increased at a rate of 2 6 c 100 km and had the highest tw range at the ebro sástago station which is the last station in the ebro depression upstream of the mequinenza reservoir the ebro sástago station is located in the most continental and driest area of the ebro river basin downstream of a reach with low slope and water speed this increase in the annual tw range down the ebro river was caused mainly by the rise of summer tw from lodosa to sástago fig 3a the ebro sástago station and the next station ebro mequinenza not affected by npps stations had the highest tw of all stations analyzed fig 2 15 9 c this effect can be attributed to the natural climatic variability which is more accused in the central reaches of the basin with a more continental climate however the increase in the annual tw range along the ebro river depression was reversed downstream of the mequinenza ribarroja flix reservoirs fig 2 as reservoirs smooth river tw webb 1988 downstream of the mequinenza reservoir tw decreased in summer and increased in winter the maximum monthly tw at sástago august was 2 0 c higher than that at mequinenza and the minimum tw january was 1 2 c lower than that at mequinenza fig 3b from september to january the ebro sástago station had a lower tw than the ebro mequinenza station and the opposite was observed from february to august fig 3b mixing in the mequinenza reservoir reduced the annual tw range to 15 0 c the tw range remained low at the flix station 14 8 c after the incorporation of the cinca segre flows but rose at the ascó station to 16 4 c only to descend downstream to 15 8 c at the xerta station and 15 7 c at the river mouth at the tortosa station table 2 fig 2 generally the maximum tw was found in august and the minimum tw was found in january only in the mequinenza reservoir did the tw minimum shift to february table 2 the reservoirs not only affected the range of the annual tw cycle but also shifted the month in which maximum and minimum tw occurred in the year at the ebro mequinenza station the minimum tw was found in february whereas from zaragoza to sástago the minimum occurred in january approximately one month before this behavior can also be appreciated through the φ1 value shift of the annual wave in the harmonic equation table 2 at the stations downstream of the reservoirs ebro mequinenza and ebro flix stations φ1 had the lowest absolute value in the basin indicating that the maximum of the annual cycle was displaced only 48 mequinenza and 50 flix days before october 1 while it was moved 68 days before that date at the ebro sástago station table 2 throughout the basin the peak of the annual tw cycle occurred 51 69 days before october 1 and this shift φ1 was highest in the tributaries except for the aragón jaca station and in the ebro depression table 2 along the ebro river this shift was higher than 56 days for all stations except for the ebro miranda and haro stations both downstream of the ebro reservoir and in the stations downstream of mequinenza showing the impact of reservoirs in reducing this shift in the central ebro depression the shift increased downstream from 57 days at lodosa to 68 days at sástago the peak of the 6 month cycles occurred before october 1 at all stations in the basin φ₂ 0 table 2 except in those downstream of the mequinenza reservoir where it occurred after that date φ₂ 0 table 2 generally the 6 month wave peaks did not follow a particular increasing or decreasing trend along the ebro river or its tributaries table 2 the maximum of the 6 month wave was found just 33 days after october 1 at the mouth of the segre segre serós station and 32 days before october 1 at the mouth of the arba arba tauste station but 72 days before that date at the mouth of the aragón aragón caparroso station table 2 along the ebro river upstream of mequinenza the maximum occurred between 6 and 52 days before october 1 with the shift being greatest at the ebro sástago station table 2 the stations located upstream and downstream of the two npps showed different tw behaviors the stations located upstream ebro cereceda station and downstream ebro miranda station of the garoña npp had similar annual ranges and cycles but the mean monthly tw at the miranda station was approximately 2 4 c higher than that at the cereceda station fig 3c on the other hand the stations upstream ebro flix station and downstream ebro ascó station of the ascó npp had different seasonal behaviors the annual range increased from the ebro mequinenza and flix stations to the ebro ascó station at 1 9 c fig 2 same increase that showed the average tw table 2 the increase in the monthly tw from the flix to ascó stations was low and constant from november to april 1 4 c and higher between june and september 2 4 2 8 c fig 3d the garoña npp effluent without a refrigeration tower discharged into the sobrón reservoir the water storage at this reservoir led to the absorption of this heat input in a similar way throughout the year minimum monthly water storage 16 0 mm³ and maximum monthly water storage 19 7 mm³ from february 1997 to the closure of the garoña npp in 2012 with some differences due to differences in the ebro river input output flow into the sobrón reservoir the period with low ebro river flow and less water input into the reservoir august to december corresponded with the higher differences in tw between the cereceda and miranda stations 3 c with a peak occurring in november 3 8 c 3 1 2 tributaries annual and seasonal results in the tributaries the mean tw and annual range increased from the headwaters to the river mouth table 2 the annual mean tw increased at a rate of 2 8 c 100 km along the aragón river from the jaca to caparroso stations and 2 0 c 100 km along the segre river from the seo to serós stations the arga river flows into the aragón at peralta arga peralta station very close to the mouth of the aragón into the ebro with a tw 13 5 c very similar to that of the aragón at its mouth 13 4 c aragón caparroso station in the same way the segre river joins the cinca a few kilometers downstream of the segre serós station very close to the cinca fraga station the tw at the segre serós station 14 8 c and cinca fraga station 14 6 c were also very similar table 2 the stations located at the river mouth of the main tributaries had similar annual tw ranges to those located in the middle reaches of the ebro river pignatelli to pina stations 16 c with the exception of the arga peralta station table 2 this station had higher tw in autumn and winter and lower tw in summer than the aragón caparroso station fig 3g another seasonal tw feature in the tributaries relative to the natural climate variability could be found at the headwater stations segre seo and aragón jaca stations where the higher flows occurred in may and june figs 3g and 3h due to snowmelt at these stations the amplitude of the six month wave φ₂ was much higher a₂ 0 8 c at jaca and 0 9 c at seo than at the rest of the stations in the basin a₂ from 0 4 c to 0 6 c table 2 pointing to a greater influence of snowmelt this fact was also shown by the evolution of tw throughout the year at both stations with a clear decrease from the annual cycle in spring figs 3g and 3h the effects of the aragón arga arba and cinca segre tributary systems on the ebro river tw were different the aragón river flows into the ebro river downstream of the ebro lodosa station and upstream of the ebro castejón station the tributary mouth stations arga peralta and aragón caparroso stations had lower tw than the ebro lodosa station in all months except for spring and it was only in this season that tw increased slightly 0 3 c from lodosa to castejón fig 3e for the rest of the year tw was higher at lodosa than at castejón with the maximum difference found in september october 0 9 c the arba river mouth station at tauste had an annual range of only 13 5 c the lowest annual range only after the aragón jaca station table 2 and quite unlike the other tributaries on the left margin aragón arga and cinca segre fig 2 on the other hand the cinca segre system discharges to the ebro river into the ribarroja reservoir downstream of the mequinenza reservoir the effect of the cinca segre discharge on the ebro river tw supersedes the effect of the mequinenza reservoir largest reservoir in the basin 1500 mm³ with a marked influence on the annual tw cycle 3 2 relationship of tw tₐ and tw streamflow all stations analyzed showed a high correlation between air temperature and water temperature tₐ and tw taken simultaneously but some differences were found between stations the linear relationship between tₐ and tw table 3 was strong r² 0 80 se 3 12 c in the ebro depression from pignatelli to sástago and at the tributary mouths arga peralta aragón caparroso cinca fraga segre serós and arba tauste stations these stations are characterized by a common physical river morphology with open valleys meandering reaches and low water velocity while their main effects come from irrigated industrial and urban areas the relationship was weaker r² 0 70 0 80 se 2 86 3 65 c at the stations downstream of the reservoirs ebro flix station and the npps ebro haro ebro ascó ebro xerta and ebro tortosa stations where the different thermal effects had a higher weight on tw than on tₐ the stations located in the headwaters aragón jaca and segre seo stations also had a weaker relationship between tw and tₐ r² 0 70 0 80 se 2 50 2 78 c in this case the effect of snowmelt in spring the different behavior of water and air at freezing temperatures in winter or even the high speed flow and changes in the tₐ with altitude could weaken this relationship the relationship between tw and tₐ was even weaker r² 0 70 se 3 22 c at the ebro miranda ebro castejón and ebro mequinenza stations at the miranda station the tw was largely controlled by garoña npp discharges and the absorption of this heat input by sobrón reservoir as shown by its seasonal behavior at the mequinenza station the heat storage in the reservoir and the altered regime of seasonal inputs and outputs controlled tw in addition to tₐ while at the castejón station tw was also affected by discharges from the aragón arga system in general the relationship between tw and flow in the ebro river and main tributaries although statistically significant was weaker than that with tₐ at all stations except for the arba tauste station tw decreased with qₘ higher flows caused lower tw the coefficient of determination at most study stations was lower than 0 50 and the standard error se was higher than 4 c table 3 the relationship between tw and flow was stronger at the stations located throughout the ebro river depression from castejón to sástago r² 0 45 se 4 10 c the ebro river stations downstream of the main reservoir and npp discharges from miranda to haro and from mequinenza to xerta had weaker relationships r² 0 30 se 4 74 c the tributaries with greater irrigation development in their basins cinca fraga and arba tauste stations had the weakest relationships at the stations at the river mouths r² 0 10 se 5 1 c for the arba river the relationship was also inverted b 0 in relation to the other stations at this station higher flows corresponded with higher tw during the summer months finally the stations in the headwaters segre seo aragón jaca and ebro cereceda stations also had very weak relationships r² 0 10 se 4 6 c 3 3 trends in water temperature in the ebro river basin the annual trend estimates using the harmonic equation and the mann kendall method m k were similar with a very strong linear relationship and coefficient of determination r² 0 976 fig 4a the monthly trends obtained by linear regression for each month and by the seasonal kendall slope estimator also showed a very strong linear relationship r² 0 949 fig 4b in both cases the slopes of the linear regressions were not significantly different from 1 and the intercepts were not significantly different from 0 p 0 95 indicating nonsignificant differences in the trends estimated by the different methods fig 4 table 4 the seasonal kendall slope estimator was chosen to evaluate the tw trends because this method i does not require normal data ii is less sensitive to outliers and iii allows for testing the homogeneity of trends in different seasons and identifying months with higher trends 3 3 1 annual trends the annual trend increased downstream on the ebro river from 0 04 c year at cereceda to 0 09 c year at tortosa showing some irregularity along the river fig 5 in the upper reaches the rate of tw increase tw rose from 0 04 c year at cereceda to 0 05 c year at miranda and haro and then declined to 0 03 c year at the next station lodosa along the ebro depression tw remained between 0 04 and 0 06 c year reaching the highest value at sástago tw 0 08 c year in the stations located in the mequinenza and flix reservoirs tw was lower than that at the upstream stations approximately 0 03 0 04 c year and finally tw showed a large increase at the last stations from ascó tw 0 12 c year where it reached the highest value in the basin to xerta tw 0 08 c year and tortosa tw 0 09 c year the thermal discharges from the npps increased the annual tw at the stations located immediately downstream the two stations immediately downstream of the garoña npp ebro miranda and ebro haro stations had higher annual trends 0 05 c year than those upstream of the ebro cereceda station 0 04 c year and downstream of the ebro lodosa station 0 03 c year table 4 in the case of the ascó npp this effect was higher tw was 0 04 c year at flix upstream of the npp but 0 12 c year at ascó downstream the mean annual tw of all stations on the ebro river was close to 0 05 c year 1 9 c increase from 1973 to 2012 while at the ebro ascó station it reached 0 12 c year equivalent to an increase of 4 5 c from 1973 to 2012 the annual trend in the middle ebro river at sástago reached 0 08 c year and decreased at the stations downstream of the reservoirs ebro mequinenza and ebro flix stations to 0 04 c year water storage in the reservoirs may have contributed to reducing the tw but although lower tw remained significant at these two stations the annual tw increased significantly at all tributary river mouth stations except the aragón caparroso station ranging from 0 03 c year in the arga and segre rivers to 0 05 c year in the arba and 0 07 c year in the cinca table 4 a general annual trend in average qm and ta was observed in all the stations in the ebro river that could be responsible for the observed trend in tw at the main ebro river stations with more completed data series ebro lodosa zaragoza and tortosa mean annual flow presented a significant trend that was estimated from 2 23 to 7 45 mm³ year table 5 fig 6 average annual tₐ trends in ebro at logroño zaragoza and tortosa aemet 2022 were significant p 0 05 and were quantified in 0 033 0 050 and 0 040 c year respectively table 5 the trend in ta was close to the trend in tw in logroño and zaragoza 0 025 and 0 054ºc year respectively but was only half of the tw trend in tortosa 0 088 c year table 4 3 3 2 seasonal trends in tw the trends in the headwaters of the ebro river from cereceda to lodosa were not homogeneous between months however monthly trends were homogeneous with an upward trend at all stations along the ebro river downstream of castejón except at the ebro pina and flix stations table 4 the trends in the headwater stations of the pyrenean tributaries aragón jaca and segre seo stations were homogeneous in all months and no significantly different from zero indicating that there was no global upward trend at the upper pyrenees stations table 4 at the downstream end of the tributaries there was a monthly homogeneous upward trend at the arga peralta segre serós and arba tauste stations but not at the aragón caparroso and cinca fraga stations table 4 the tw trends at all ebro river stations increased from autumn to spring except for february and march when some stations had lower trends table 4 and had significant upward trends from april to july being significant in may in all of them table 4 at the stations downstream of the ebro ascó station there were also many months with significant tw trends from december to march and in august september among the tributary mouth stations only the arga peralta aragón caparroso and arba tauste stations followed the pattern observed in the ebro river downstream of castejón while the segre serós station only had significant trends in october and the cinca fraga station only in march april and july to september table 4 at the pyrenean headwater stations there were only two singular months with significant trends october at the aragón jaca station and june at the segre seo station table 4 aggregating the monthly data into seasons the spring april to june average trend was higher than 0 08 c year for all stations on the ebro river except for those in the lower reach reservoirs mequinenza and flix fig 7 in all stations except the ebro mequinenza station and the downstream segre serós and cinca fraga stations and headwater segre seo and aragón jaca stations stations in the cinca segre system at least two months had significant upward trends p 0 05 in spring table 4 the highest values were at the ebro sástago station in june with an increase of 0 24 c year and the ebro ascó station with 0 14 c year for all spring months table 4 on the other hand the period with fewer months with significant tw was autumn october to december table 4 in this season all stations along the ebro river had nonsignificant trends except sástago and the last two stations xerta and tortosa in december table 4 in contrast october trends were significant and high 0 09 0 12 c year at the two stations on the aragón river caparroso and jaca the mouth of the segre river segre serós station and the arba tauste station where the trend in november was also significant table 4 during summer july to september only the stations on the ebro river downstream of the mequinenza reservoir had significant trends for more than two months with a peak at ascó in july tw 0 17 c year with respect to tributaries the cinca fraga station was the only station that had significant trends in all summer months reaching the highest value of the year 0 09 0 13 c year table 4 fig 7 finally in winter the tw trend showed similar behavior to the summer season only the stations below the ascó npp had more than two months with significant upward trends especially the ebro ascó station which had trends in the whole season above 0 14 c year in winter the ebro sástago station had two months with a significant trend unlike summer and among the stations downstream of the reservoirs only mequinenza had a significant trend in february other stations on the ebro river with significant winter trends were those situated downstream of the garoña npp miranda and haro where january tw increased by 0 07 c year table 4 among the tributary stations only the aragón jaca and cinca fraga stations had a significant trend in march table 4 fig 7 the stations located downstream of the npps ebro miranda and ebro ascó stations increased their tw in relation to the upstream stations ebro cereceda and ebro flix stations in all seasons except for autumn and summer at miranda fig 7 at miranda the tw was not significant from july to december while at ascó only the months from october to december had nonsignificant trends table 4 the highest monthly tw in the basin was found at ascó where the tw was higher than 0 11 c year from january to september table 4 which entailed an increase in tw of more than 5 c during the study period 1980 2012 during summer and winter the tw was nonsignificant for most months upstream of the ascó npp but many months had significant and very high trends at the stations from ascó downstream fig 7 which were always lower at xerta and tortosa than at ascó table 4 regarding the influence of the large reservoirs in the lower reaches the mequinenza and flix stations did not have monthly tw as high as the upstream station ebro sástago station and the downstream station ebro ascó station in any season fig 7 the monthly tw trends were significant at mequinenza only in february and may and at flix from april to august table 4 generally the monthly trends increased along the ebro river in winter spring and summer and were not as clear in autumn fig 7 in the four seasons the pattern of increasing monthly trends down the ebro river was interrupted abruptly at mequinenza where the monthly tw was generally lower than that upstream sástago this decrease in the tw along the river at mequinenza was less pronounced in winter fig 7 in spring summer and winter the trends in the tributary mouths were lower than the trends at the ebro river stations upstream of their mouths except for the cinca fraga station in summer and winter fig 7 in contrast during autumn the tw was higher in the tributaries than at the stations immediately upstream of their confluence fig 7 the mouth stations of the aragón arga system and the arba river had significant trends mainly in spring and around october whereas the cinca segre system had a different behavior at its mouth with no significant trends at the segre serós station except for october and significant trends mainly during summer and march april at the cinca fraga station table 4 fig 7 the seasonal tw trends were similar to those present in qm and tₐ in the 3 stations where these parameters were analyzed fig 6 table 5 the stations at the ebro river lodosa zaragoza and tortosa showed a significant decrease in monthly flows that were estimated from 1 9 to 17 8 mm³ year from april to july the only spring month without any significant flow trend was may table 5 the meteorological stations analyzed logroño zaragoza and tortosa presented the same behaviors for tₐ with significant trends from 0 06 c year to 0 10 c year in all months from april to june except for logroño in june all these slopes were lower than the tw trends at the closer quality stations table 4 and table 5 october also showed an upward ta trend in the 3 stations table 5 while it was a month in which no significant trend was observed in tw in any station along the ebro river table 4 4 discussion all recent studies have noted a clear increase in air temperature in the last century that should affect water temperatures ipcc 2022 in this work we found that tw in the ebro river has increased in most of the study stations over the last 40 years it is difficult to define what part of these tw changes should be attributed to the evolution of tₐ and what part should be attributed to other factors such as reservoir construction and management increases in water consumption land use changes such as irrigation development or thermal discharges among others apparently the behavior of tw throughout the study period was not the result of any single specific environmental or anthropogenic change it must have been a combination of all of them the tw at the ebro river stations with similar kinds of effects showed a common behavior the mequinenza ribarroja flix reservoir system caused a decrease in the tw annual range at the downstream stations the spring and summer tw values decreased while the autumn and winter tw values increased dolz et al 1996 also found differences of more than 5 c in the mean tw between the upstream reach of the mequinenza reservoir and downstream of the flix dam using continuous tw measurements from june to july 1990 this lower temperature water discharge from the mequinenza reservoir increased its temperature at a rate of 0 2 c km downstream in the higher insolation hours until the river regained its natural tw prats et al 2010 measured tw at 9 control stations along the lower reaches of the ebro river from the mequinenza reservoir to xerta and the segre cinca river mouths from 1997 to 2003 at 10 minute intervals they found that the annual tw range changed along this reach the range was 3 c smaller downstream of the reservoirs with the temperature cycle lagging 20 days in relation to the upstream stations they showed how tw decreased in spring summer with a maximum decrease of 3 5 4 0 c in june july and increased in autumn winter with a peak increase of 3 0 3 5 c in november in relation to the nonaffected upper reaches these authors also noted that the cinca segre immediately upstream of the ribarroja reservoir contributed to the reservoir tw stratification in spring and summer months and raised the tw in the reservoir outflow this could in turn have reduced the cooling ability of these waters upon the ascó npp effluents during summer in this study similar results to those of prats et al 2010 were found at stations below reservoirs the annual range at flix downstream of the reservoirs was 3 2 c lower than that at sástago upstream of the mequinenza reservoir the summer mean tw at the flix station was 3 3 c lower than that at sástago with maximum differences found in july 3 8 c and the autumn mean tw at flix was 2 5 c higher with maximum differences occurring in november 3 1 c finally this study showed that the maximum and minimum tw at the downstream stations occurred one month later compared to the upstream stations it must be considered that the difference in tw between the sástago and flix stations was not a consequence of the mequinenza reservoir regulation alone the high flow discharge from the cinca segre river with lower mean tw than the ebro mequinenza station immediately upstream of the ribarroja reservoir also affected the tw of the ribarroja output this difference was also higher because the sástago station had a particularly high tw range compared to other stations in the ebro depression if the annual range at flix is compared to the range at the ebro river stations from pignatelli to pina all of them located in the ebro depression upstream of sástago the difference decreased to only 1 5 c the reservoir system led to a decrease in tw trends at downstream stations thus the lowest annual trends were observed at the ebro flix tw 0 041 c year and mequinenza stations tw 0 036 c year nuclear power plant discharges produced a significant increase in tw the highest increases were found during the summer months in the case of the ascó npp 2 7 c matching the lowest flow period in the case of the garoña npp the tw increase was more homogeneous throughout the year with higher values from august to december 3 c the different effects of the two npps on the ebro river tw patterns could be explained by the differences in streamflow and the effect of the sobrón reservoir streamflow was 6 times higher at the ebro ascó station than at the ebro miranda station around the ascó npp the highest flows in winter and spring december to may matched the lowest differences in tw between the flix and ascó stations fig 3d in these months the heat discharge from the ascó npp was absorbed by the ebro river more easily and thus the difference in tw between the two stations remained relatively low the lower flow during the summer months in the ebro river diminished the ability of the river to absorb the thermal discharges from the ascó npp leading to higher differences during summer between the flix and ascó stations table 2 fig 3d the effects of the ascó npp on the ebro river tw was studied by prats et al 2010 these authors concluded that the discharges from this npp increased the annual tw by approximately 3 c 1998 2003 the variability along the year depended on the ebro river discharge tw increase was more noticeable in low flow periods and additionally on the ascó npp management the mean tw difference between the ebro flix and ebro ascó stations was 2 0 c with a higher difference from june to september 2 4 2 8 c coinciding with low ebro river flows the lower differences obtained in this work coincided with a longer tw series 1975 2008 than in prats et al 2010 which took into account some cold tw years before ascó npp activity alberto and arrúe 1986 estimated an increase in the ebro river tw of 3 c associated with the garoña npp effluent calculated from the npp input and ebro river flow they observed that the flow weighted mean tw increased at miranda from 9 3 c before the start of the garoña npp 1960 1971 to 12 3 c thereafter 1972 1982 they concluded that tw in the river downstream of the garoña npp decreased by thermal dissipation to water and air and due to the thermal storage in the sobrón reservoir in this study the difference in annual mean tw between cereceda and miranda was 2 8 c half a degree higher than the difference observed by alberto and arrúe 1986 at the same stations 2 3 c from 1972 to 1982 this difference can be attributed to the tw trends observed the annual trend at cereceda was lower than that at miranda thus increasing the difference in tw between the two stations with time except for garoña npp effluents there is no other plausible origin for the ebro miranda station high tw there are no high flowing tributaries groundwater or urban main discharges or large reservoirs the water storage in the sobrón reservoir did not seem to be enough to absorb the garoña heat effluent and to bring the ebro river back to its natural tw the highest annual tw trend was observed at the ebro ascó station tw 0 12 c year this high value can only be explained by the npp activity since 1985 however it is important to mention that the temperature series at the ebro ascó station started in 1980 thus including 5 years with no discharges from the ascó npp these first 5 years with lower tw values may have led to the calculation of higher tw trends excluding the first 5 years from the analysis the annual trend was 0 08 c year and remained within the same range as the other lower ebro river stations from sástago to tortosa except for the reservoir stations table 4 irrigation return flows produced an increase in tw but this behavior was not clear at all stations affected by the return flows from irrigated areas the mean annual tw and annual range at the arba tauste station were lower than those at other stations with similar climatic characteristics the arba river basin is located in a semiarid area in the middle ebro depression and its headwaters do not originate from the pyrenees but from the lower pre pyrenean range fig 1 the arba river is also the main collector of the irrigation return flows of the bardenas irrigation scheme which moved the maximum flow to the spring and summer period during the irrigation season fig 3f additionally the irrigation water for the arba river basin is diverted from the aragón river at the yesa reservoir in the aragón river headwaters fig 1 this cold water was applied to the fields during the summer months contributing to reducing the summer tw and consequently to lessening the annual range fig 3f alberto and arrúe 1986 found that the arba tauste station had higher thermal storage by unit mass than other stations in the surrounding area they attributed this feature to the high flow during the irrigation season and not to warmer irrigation return flows they attributed the different tw between the arba tauste station and other stations to the supply of cool irrigation water and to the effects of evaporation and the cooling of the soils by irrigation water it must be considered that most of the arba irrigated land is flood irrigated 78 with low irrigation efficiency 62 lorenzo gonzález 2022 arga peralta station had higher tw in autumn and winter and lower tw in summer than aragón caparroso station fig 3g in contrast with other tributaries there is not much agricultural area in the arga river basin 5500 ha in 1999 2 and 10 700 ha in 2009 4 ine 2009 in addition there are no major reservoirs along the arga river only the minor alloz 65 mm³ and eugui 22 mm³ reservoirs in the headwaters and the main populated areas pamplona are located 90 km upstream of the arga peralta station these natural features and the smaller anthropogenic effects in the arga basin as compared with other tributary basins aragón cinca and segre may lead to lower temperature range and amplitude at its mouth the different tw values at the tributary mouth stations suggest a link between the tw trend and irrigation development irrigated surfaces account for 16 and 28 of the total basin surface in the cinca and arba rivers respectively with higher tw increases while irrigated land is 7 in the aragón arga basin and 10 in the segre river basin irrigated land area elaborated with data from che 2022 with lower tw increases table 4 the discharges of the main tributaries affected tw in the ebro river the aragón river inputs decreased the mean annual tw and the annual temperature range in the ebro river however this behavior changed between seasons and depended on the difference in tw between the ebro and aragón rivers and the flow ratios tw in the ebro river decreased from summer to winter and increased in spring alberto and arrúe 1986 found that the aragón jaca station and yesa reservoir had not attained a tₐ tw equilibrium due to the high difference between tₐ and tw and to the high flow speed of this mountain river these authors concluded that the storage time in the yesa reservoir was not enough to reach equilibrium in temperature and that the aragón river probably would not reach this equilibrium all the way down to the mouth except in spring when the tw in the aragón river is similar or even higher than that at the ebro lodosa station furthermore the ebro river at the aragón river discharge point had an abnormally high temperature produced by the garoña npp thermal effluent as mentioned above and did not reach tₐ tw equilibrium for more than 150 km downstream from the garoña npp alberto and arrúe 1986 the headwater stations aragón jaca and segre seo basically controlled by natural climate variability exhibited a particular tw behavior linked to snowmelt for these stations the increase in tw during spring months from april to june was lower than that at the stations at the river mouths which matched the higher thawing flows arrúe and alberto 1986 found a relationship between flow and tw that was unrelated to tₐ on the ebro river at escatrón close to the sástago station they attributed this relationship to episodes of river floods produced by snowmelt alberto and arrúe 1986 found that the annual tw in the pyrenean headwaters was lower than tₐ with a difference of more than 1 5 c at the aragón jaca station and in the yesa reservoir this difference could also be observed at lower altitude stations as a result of the water origin and the high flow velocity in these kinds of rivers the best stations to analyze tw effects by water diversion are located in the ebro river lower reach at xerta and tortosa 14 km downstream the xerta weir diverts more than 1200 mm³ year at a high flow rate 40 m³ s during the irrigation season april to october during summer the ebro river flow upstream of the xerta weir is approximately 200 m³ s and it is in this period when abstraction effects should be more noticeable downstream of the weir with a closer tw tₐ relationship and an increase in tw and tₐ that should result in a higher annual range downstream of the xerta weir the river would have less thermal capacity lower flow velocity and higher residence time that would make the river more sensitive to summer high tₐ nevertheless the difference between stations was not particularly high and missing data at the ebro xerta station in some years did not allow for a comparison between both stations in general annual tw trends increased from the upper reaches to the river mouths in the ebro river and its tributaries although some of these trends were nonsignificant average of the mean annual significant trends was 0 05 c year there was also a clear seasonal behavior in the trends the spring months had the highest significant trend mean monthly tw 0 10 c year at most stations bouza deaño et al 2008 studied the trends estimated by the seasonal kendall slope estimator of 34 chemical and physical parameters at 13 ebro river stations from a shorter data series 1981 2004 they found a significant tw increase at most stations with a mean trend of 0 08 c year these authors found the highest tw at the ebro zaragoza station 0 18 c year threefold the value found in this study 0 05 c year followed by sástago 0 16 c year these authors also found a clearly lower trend at the reservoir stations 0 03 c year and higher increases downstream of the ascó npp 0 08 c year versus 0 12 c year in this work these differences may be attributed to the different periods of the data series alberto and arrúe 1986 found for the lower ebro river at escatrón close to sástago an increase of 0 08 c year for the annual flow weighed average tw 1955 1978 and prats et al 2007 with a more complete data series 1955 2000 obtained an increase of 0 05 c year at the same station it is difficult to compare this information with that obtained in this work at the ebro sástago station 0 08 c year because of the different data periods nevertheless the trends were significant in the three studies indicating a persistent temperature increase since the 1950 s the general behavior in tw could be related to the apparent flow trends in the ebro river basin the highly regulated rivers had a decreasing trend in flow during spring and the increase in tw was highest in spring the progressive increase in the regulated flow in the ebro river basin during these years resulted in higher volumes of stored water in spring decreasing the river flow lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 found a decrease in discharge in more than 90 of the gauging stations in the ebro river basin following the increase in water consumption by agriculture and urban and industrial uses and the extension of natural vegetation in the basin headwaters at the expense of traditional agriculture lópez moreno et al 2011 also álvarez cabria et al 2016 applied a forest model to study the spatial and seasonal variability of water quality in the ebro river basin and found that an increase in forest cover reduced the mean annual tw the result has been an increase in tw as more heat resulting from rising tₐ must be absorbed by less water resulting from lower flows lower flows also increase water travel times which induces lower thermal inertia prats et al 2010 in this work all stations along the ebro river and especially the ebro in tortosa showed a decreasing flow the decrease in flows matched the increase in tw observed in the 1970 s to the 1990 s pointing to a possible contribution of the flow decrease upon the tw trends additionally global warming has induced a progressive decrease in snow storage in the ebro river basin in the last 50 years magrama 2008 lópez moreno and garcía ruiz 2004 in mountainous areas of the ebro river basin the increase in tₐ has led to a higher ratio of rainfall to snowfall thus accelerating snowmelt lópez moreno et al 2011 the displacement of the peak melting flow to the early spring ipcc 2022 lópez moreno et al 2011 and the progressive decrease in snow storage magrama 2008 lópez moreno and garcía ruiz 2004 due to global warming also introduced less cold water during spring months this effect is felt in the upper and middle ebro river reaches where the minimum tw are found during the high flows originating from snowmelt arrúe and alberto 1986 accordingly the highest and most significant trends in tw were found in the spring months 5 future tasks the prognosis for the first half of the century in the ebro river basin is not promising air temperature is expected to increase by a mean of 1 5 1 6 c with a maximum value in summer of 2 8 c magrama 2010 and precipitation although there has been no clear trend in recent decades de castro et al 2005 lópez moreno et al 2011 garcía vera et al 2002 is supposed to decrease between 3 and 4 magrama 2010 in this context the ebro river semiarid reaches with low flow velocity less area protected by riparian vegetation and a large exposed surface would experience the highest tw increases due to climate change the analysis of river flows is also important many of the natural and anthropogenic factors affecting tw in the ebro river including climate change may also be altered by the reduction in river discharge there is an apparent relationship between the evolution of tw in the ebro river and its tributaries rising trend and the evolution of their flows decreasing trend future studies may focus on elucidating how the changes in river flows interfere with the tw tₐ relationship how they affect the heat transport capacity of rivers and how these changes may aggravate some tw effects such as urban or industrial thermal discharges furthermore clear links were found between tw and tₐ at all stations but the strength of this link is different at different stations reaches of rivers and regions in the basin stations downstream of major dams pyrenean headwaters etc additional research should be conducted to establish the nature and causes of these differences there are other factors affecting the ebro river tw such as the groundwater supply and its thermal characteristics the right bank tributaries exert important tw control due to this effect in the ebro river basin alberto and arrúe 1986 however given that these rivers do not contribute high discharges to the ebro river they were not included in this study these groundwater controls could be included at a further stage in the analysis of the ebro river water temperature regime further consideration may be given to the selection of the sampling hour and day within the month to obtain adequate readings close to the average tw of the month the continuous 15 minute interval data of the saica network of the che che 2021b provide substantial information at some stations to help in the selection of the right sampling time for tw isidoro et al 2013 6 conclusions along the ebro river the tw regime is markedly influenced by the effluents of the garoña and ascó npps and the tampering effect of the mequinenza ribarroja flix reservoir system the larger tributaries on the left bank aragón arga and cinca segre rivers also exert a noticeable influence compared to these factors the influence of irrigation return flows and irrigation development on water temperature was low the flow regime and climate change are also factors that have a clear influence on tw especially during spring the influence of tₐ on tw was more pronounced at the stations along the ebro river depression pignatelli to sástago and at the mouth of the main tributaries aragón arga arba segre and cinca rivers this influence was lower at the stations affected by npp effluents or downstream of the main reservoirs and in the pyrenean headwaters aragón jaca and segre seo stations water temperature was therefore better related to tₐ in the lower reaches of rivers under natural conditions where low summer flows coincided with the highest tₐ indicating that this relationship might be linked to the relationship between tw and qₘ river flow showed a weaker relationship with tw but the pattern of the link between tw and qₘ throughout the stations was similar to that of tₐ tw lower tw was linked to higher qₘ at all stations except the arba tauste station the station in which summer flows were essentially dominated by irrigation return flows there was an average annual upward trend in tw only the stations in the pyrenean headwaters aragón jaca and segre seo stations and the aragón caparroso station did not show significant annual trends the magnitude of this trend increased downstream along the ebro river with peak values at the npp affected stations and lower values at reservoir affected stations climate change and flow trends are also factors that must be considered in studying the seasonal behavior and trends of tw the decrease in spring flows due to increased river regulation has reduced the cooling effect of spring snowmelt whereas global warming has accelerated the thawing process these factors explained the seasonal tw trend patterns the monthly trends were highest and most significant during spring at all stations along the ebro river on the other hand low and nonsignificant seasonal tw trends were found in autumn except for the significant slopes found

7644,study region the ebro river basin northeast spain study focus the work analyzes the evolution of water temperature tw in the ebro river and its main tributaries its annual cycle and its trends as well as the effects of various natural and anthropogenic factors on them new hydrological insights for the region stations located downstream of nuclear power plants showed an anomalous increase in tw not consistent with the river section where they are located with higher values in the lower flow months august to december the stations affected by the main reservoirs along the ebro river showed a lower annual temperature range and the stations located in large irrigation systems showed a lower summer temperature compared to other stations with similar climatic conditions finally there was a significant annual increase in tw at all stations mean tw 0 05 c year except those located at the head of the tributaries these trends were higher for the stations downstream of the ascó nuclear power plant tw 0 08 c year seasonally the spring months showed the greatest changes with higher increases at the stations downstream of ascó tw 0 10 c year the increase in air temperature associated with

occurring in the water stevens et al 1975 it is also an important variable affecting water quality regarding industrial water supply refrigeration systems and recreational uses high water temperature enhances the growth of microorganisms and may increase problems due to bad taste odor or color and corrosion problems who 2022 on the other hand water temperature in rivers average value evolution through the year and long term trends results from natural and anthropogenic factors air temperature volume of precipitation as rainfall and snowfall groundwater discharge and land cover are some of the natural factors while return flows from human activities such as industrial uses mainly refrigeration irrigation or climate and land use changes are some of the anthropogenic factors water temperature has a paramount influence on river ecosystems affecting the life cycles of many organisms their rate of growth and metabolic or reproductive rates and interfering with the competitiveness among species schmidt nielsen 1997 garcía de jalón 1996 garcía de jalon et al 1988 ward and stanford 1982 vannote and sweeney 1980 nebeker 1971 water temperature also affects water composition through its influence on mineral solubility and co₂ partial pressure stumm and morgan 1970 an increase in tw generally increases salt solubility and therefore water salinity catalán and catalán 1987 an analysis of the main mineral dissolution rates for the waters of the ebro river basin showed that tw and air temperature tₐ related to the co₂ partial pressure had a positive relationship with the number of calcite and dolomite saturated and oversaturated samples alberto and navas 1987 water temperature is also a conditioning factor for water ph with ph decreasing as tw increases labrador páez et al 2019 the ebro river basin authority confederación hidrográfica del ebro che has monitored tw as a possible cause of water acidification trends che 2012 and found a general upward trend in water acidification and in tw in many control points of the rivers related to the atmospheric emissions of thermal power plants dissolved oxygen do an important factor for aquatic life is determined by tw as cold water can hold more dissolved oxygen than warm water stevens et al 1975 higher tw may also enhance organism metabolism leading to enhanced oxygen consumption and decreasing do this alteration can contribute to anoxia events in deep rivers with low water velocity prats 2011 or to the profusion of macrophytes in stretches downstream of major reservoirs where minimum flows are quite constant garcía vera 2013 in this regard the che has implemented a water temperature depth profile control network throughout reservoirs in the ebro river basin to prevent eutrophication and to study water stratification che 2018 water temperature is controlled primarily by climatic and geographic factors such as annual and daily solar radiation cycles contribution from snowmelt or river altitude many of these factors such as rainfall temperature or snowmelt patterns can be affected by climate variability in general a higher altitude entails a lower average and lower annual range of tw arrúe and alberto 1986 other natural drivers of tw in a river stretch are groundwater discharge including thermal springs flow velocity channel characteristics and storage capacity riparian area and inputs from tributaries poole and berman 2001 human effects on tw are normally derived from riparian and land use changes channel alterations and discharges either directly to the main stem or through tributaries the most important anthropogenic drivers of tw are water storage in reservoirs and river regulation webb 1996 webb and walling 1988 discharges from nuclear or thermal power plants peterson and jaske 1968 urban and industrial discharges kinouchi et al 2007 river channeling and riparian modifications poole and berman 2001 irrigation return flows verma 1986 and changes in land uses or water diversions beschta and taylor 1988 climate change is also an anthropogenic driver of tw trends it can affect tw in a different fashion either through changes in air temperature or in precipitation amount and intensity of the rainfall and the type of precipitation rain or snow during the last century tₐ increased over most of the ebro river basin with an average increase of 0 2 c per decade in the 1950 2006 period de castro et al 2005 and a higher summer increase up to 0 34 c per decade lópez moreno et al 2011 land use changes also contribute to alterations in the flow regime gusarov 2019 fazel et al 2017 and thus of tw álvarez cabria et al 2016 alterations in the natural thermal regime of rivers have been found worldwide the european environmental agency eea reported an increase in tw of 1 3 c in the major european rivers over the last century eea 2017 for instance the mean tw increased by 1 c in the danube river during the last century and by 3 c in the lower reaches of the rhine river between 1910 and 2010 the tw increase in the rhine river was attributed mainly to the increase in water use for cooling with one third attributed to the increase in tₐ as a result of climate change eea 2017 the main stretch of the danube river in austria showed an increase of 0 8 1 0 c in the 1901 1990 period with the highest value 2 0 c in october and november webb and nobilis 1995 part of this increase was associated with heated effluents and regulation and with the climate patterns of the north atlantic oscillation webb and nobilis 2007 other studies in the usa showed an increase of 0 009 0 077 c year in 20 major streams and rivers kaushal et al 2010 with higher trends in summer months seven unregulated rivers in the northwestern usa showed a summer increase of 0 22 c per decade for the 1980 2009 period in which the dominant driving factor was the observed increase in tₐ isaak et al 2011 except for some general studies in the 1980 s arrúe and alberto 1986 alberto and arrúe 1986 most studies on the tw of the ebro river basin have focused either on the effects of anthropogenic alterations on tw or on the effects of tw on river ecosystems val et al 2016 garcía de jalón 1996 garcía de jalón et al 1988 most of the latter studies have generally addressed the effects of reservoirs and discharges from the ascó nuclear power plant in the lower reach of the ebro river arbat bofill et al 2014 prats 2012 prats et al 2010 val et al 2003 dolz et al 1996 other studies have analyzed the trends of tw along with other water quality parameters using different statistical tools abaurrea et al 2011 valencia 2007 bouza 2006 or have even developed models for the creation of tw scenarios val et al 2018 thus there has been a lack of specific studies on the temporal and spatial variability of tw in the ebro river basin that incorporate the river as a continuous system the few analyses available on tw trends did not incorporate long and complete data series diamantini et al 2018 bouza deaño et al 2008 furthermore the ebro river basin authority has been recording tw since 1972 at the main water quality monitoring stations along the ebro river and its main tributaries che 2021a this 40 year long series offers a good opportunity to analyze the behavior of tw in a global context including spatial distribution seasonal patterns and long term trends the objectives of this paper are i to assess the thermal regime of the ebro river and its main tributaries over a 40 year period ii to establish the trends in surface water temperatures in the ebro river basin and iii to search for patterns in the thermal regime and especially water temperature trends and their potential link to natural factors or anthropogenic drivers such as water diversion power plants cooling urban and agricultural discharges or land use changes this is necessarily a preliminary analysis as it only addresses the course and main tributaries of the ebro river and does not incorporate long term detailed information on land uses and water diversion however it may be used as a starting point for establishing the links between climate variability global warming and land use changes with tw providing frameworks for analyzing future scenarios of water and land use and climate change on tw both directly and through diminished water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the ebro river is the largest flowing river on the iberian peninsula with a natural flow of 15 506 mm3 year 1980 2017 che 2022 and a length of 950 km it has a catchment area of 85 570 km² with high physiographic and climatic variability it is located between 4 24 15 w and 43 02 17 n and 0 52 7 e and 40 43 49 n the basin is limited to the north by the cantabrian mountains and the pyrenean range with altitudes up to 3500 m a s l and to the south by the iberian ranges up to 2500 m a s l these ranges and the headwater areas have an oceanic and mediterranean mountain climate with precipitation from 800 to 2000 mm year and a mean annual air temperature tₐ from 9 c to 12 c che 2022 in contrast the central basin area ebro depression is characterized by a dry mediterranean continental climate with low and discontinuous precipitation 350 700 mm year and a mean annual tₐ of 11 14 c with an annual range of 17 20 c che 2022 the river source is in the cantabrian mountains at 880 m a s l extreme north west of the basin fig 1 and the river mouth is located on the mediterranean coast in the southeastern part of the basin the main tributaries of the ebro river are located on the left bank originating from the pyrenees and include the aragón arga natural flow 4145 mm³ year and cinca segre 5423 mm³ year river systems fig 1 which account for 62 of the total flow of the ebro river data for 1980 2017 che 2022 the inflows from the right bank amount to only 5 of the total flow batalla et al 2004 the ebro river flow regime is influenced accordingly by the left bank tributaries with a contribution of snowmelt in the late spring season that represents 6 of the total water supply of the ebro river basin magrama 2008 the maximum natural flow for these pluvio nival or nivo pluvial tributaries occur in the late spring months or even summer months bejarano et al 2010 masachs 1948 on the other hand the ebro river natural flow presents a pluvial regime influenced in the middle lower reaches by the nivo pluvial regime of the left bank tributaries masachs 1948 and is characterized by long periods of maximum flows during winter and spring bejarano et al 2010 the mean annual flow shows a significant decreasing trend in the river tributaries between 1 for the aragón arga river and 3 for the cinca segre river lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 1945 2005 the flow at the last gauging station was 2747 mm³ year for the aragón arga river and 3724 mm³ year for the cinca segre river from 1980 81 2017 18 magrama 2021 the ebro river shows the same behavior the mean annual flow for the final gauging station at tortosa was 9087 mm³ year in the same period 31 lower than the historic average of 13 087 mm³ year 1912 13 2017 18 magrama 2021 showing a significant decreasing trend of 2 9 m³ s per year lorenzo gonzález et al 2014 irrigated agriculture is the main water user in the ebro river basin accounting for 92 2 of the total diversions che 2022 the irrigated area has been increasing steadily in recent years and reaches almost 924 000 ha 11 of the total surface with a current demand estimated at 8141 mm³ year che 2022 the irrigated surface is particularly important in the cinca segre river basin with 371 000 ha 16 of the total basin in the arba river basin with 60 000 ha 28 and less important in the aragón arga river basins with 64 700 ha 7 elaborated using data from che 2022 the diversions for urban 483 mm³ year and industrial 208 mm³ year uses are much lower che 2022 there are some reservoirs and several weirs along the main stem used for diverting water for irrigation the ebro reservoir storage capacity of 540 mm³ is located in the ebro river headwaters and is managed mainly for regulation fig 1 the lower reaches of the main stem are dominated by the mequinenza reservoir 1534 mm³ for hydropower generation upstream of the confluence of the cinca segre and the smaller ribarroja and flix reservoirs downstream also for hydropower generation fig 1 other important reservoirs are located on the pyrenean tributaries yesa reservoir with 476 mm³ and itoiz reservoir with 418 mm³ on the aragón river basin el grado mediano system on the cinca river with 835 mm³ canelles santa ana system with 915 mm³ and rialb reservoir with 403 mm³ in the segre river basin these reservoirs supply water for the large irrigated areas on the left margin bardenas 78 000 ha alto aragón 133 000 ha aragón y cataluña canal 96 000 ha and urgel 66 000 ha che 2022 there are two main thermal discharge sources from nuclear power plants npps fig 1 along the ebro river the garoña npp located in the upper reaches of the ebro river was active from march 1971 to december 2012 with an annual mean output of 3800 gwh nuclenor 2013 the garoña npp did not have refrigeration towers and discharged to the sobrón reservoir 20 mm³ the ascó npp is located in the lower reaches of the ebro river it has been fully active since march 1986 with two reactors ascó i and ascó ii the ascó npp has a mean annual output of 15 000 gwh coll et al 1996 anav 2012 and its refrigeration effluent is discharged directly to the ebro river downstream of the flix reservoir after flowing through a refrigeration tower built in 1995 the ascó npp has a 77 m³ s water allowance for refrigeration and another 29 m³ s for thermal dilution che 2008 finally the main cities along the ebro river zaragoza population 680 000 and logroño population 154 000 and to a lesser extent miranda de ebro population 38 000 in the upper reach and their surrounding industrial areas may be another source of thermal affection fig 1 the effluents of another four cities may affect the tw in some left bank tributaries lleida population 138 000 on the segre river vitoria population 245 000 on the zadorra river pamplona population 195 000 on the arga river and huesca population 52 000 on the smaller isuela river 2 2 database the surface water quality control network swq of the ebro river basin was created by the che and started collecting monthly tw data in 1972 73 mopu 1990 the network started with 22 monitoring stations and today the number of stations in the network has increased to more than 500 che 2021a twenty one swq stations were selected on the ebro river and its main tributaries for this study 14 on the ebro river and 7 on the main tributaries from each station the instant monthly data of tw tₐ che 2021a mopu 1990 the flow at the time of measurement qᵢ che 2021a mopu 1990 and the mean monthly flow qₘ magrama 2021 were retrieved one data point per month both tw and tₐ series were screened and the values that were deemed blunt errors were eliminated the sampling frequency was reduced in 2012 from monthly to quarterly and thus the data analyzed in this work correspond to monthly data in the 40 year period from october 1973 to september 2012 missing 8 years with a strong increase in air temperature from 2012 to 2020 the information from 2012 to 2022 was not included to avoid spurious influences in the establishment of trends for months with missing data there were two important factors in the selection of the stations long and reasonably complete data series and the plausibility of the stations to be affected by the main temperature drivers in the ebro river basin thus they were located downstream of nuclear power plants regulated reaches reservoirs and main irrigation areas or on the main tributaries table 1 fig 1 data series at some stations were not complete table 1 thus the period from october 1975 to september 2008 was selected to compare the behavior of tw throughout the year at all stations while the trends were analyzed with the longest series available at each station two stations were selected in the headwaters of the aragón aragón jaca station 18 2 2 the number indicates the station id in the surface water quality control network swq and segre rivers segre seo station 23 presumably with little or no thermal effects and one in the headwaters of the ebro river ebro cereceda station 161 125 km downstream of the ebro reservoir the thermal conditions and their changes along the main tributaries were monitored with data from the arga peralta 4 aragón caparroso 5 aragón arga river system cinca fraga 17 segre serós 25 cinca segre river system and arba river tauste stations 60 in the upper reach of the main stem the ebro miranda station 1 is the first quality station downstream of the garoña npp and the ebro haro station 208 may also be affected by garoña npp effluent 48 km upstream whereas the ebro ascó 163 xerta 212 and tortosa 27 stations are located downstream of the ascó npp along the ebro river middle reaches the main thermal influences are diversions for irrigation ebro pignatelli 162 pina 211 and xerta 212 in addition influences due to inflows from tributaries ebro castejón 2 the stations in the lower ebro river reaches are also affected by the flow regulation of the mequinenza reservoir ebro mequinenza station 29 with two stations located downstream of the confluence of the cinca river on smaller reservoirs the ebro flix 210 and ebro ascó stations 163 table 1 finally 3 stations from the spanish meteorological agency aemet 2022 were selected to analyze monthly ta trends 9170 logroño 9434 zaragoza airport and 9981a tortosa these stations are the closest ones to 3 quality stations on the ebro river used in this work lodosa zaragoza and tortosa respectively and unlike the water quality stations they have very complete data series of mean daily tₐ from 1973 74 2011 12 2 3 statistical procedures 2 3 1 water temperature characterization the tw annual cycle was characterized through a harmonic equation fitted by regression on the number of months since the beginning of the time series n which also allowed for the calculation of the average trend 1 t w b 0 b 1 n c 1 sin n π 6 d 1 co s n π 6 c 2 sin n π 3 d 2 co s n π 3 where b₀ intercept of the regression is the tw the month prior to the beginning of the series n 0 and b₁ is the regression coefficient for n an estimate of the trend in c month with 12 measurements per year ck and dk are the regression coefficients of the transformed variables sin k n π 6 and cos k n π 6 which account for cycles with angular frequency ω 2 π k 12 k π 6 that is for cycles with a period t 1 k yr and frequency ν k yr 1 other higher and lower frequencies were tried but only the cycles with frequencies 1 and 2 periods of one year and six months respectively were significant p 0 05 in at least one of the transformed variables sine or cosine for all series while no other frequency showed significant coefficients thus only the harmonics of order two were fitted to all stations from the trigonometric identity 2 cos a b cos a cos b sin a sin b eq 1 can be rewritten as 3 t w b 0 b 1 n a 1 co s n π 6 φ 1 a 2 co s n π 3 φ 2 with 4 a k c k 2 d k 2 φ k arctan c k d k k 1 2 which allows for a more direct interpretation of the parameters ak and φk are the amplitude and phase angle of the wave of frequency k yr 1 respectively the phase angle in radians may be converted to months or days with 5 φ month 6 φ rad π φ day 365 25 φ rad 2 π with a positive negative sign indicating the days after before the observation for which n 0 or multiples of 12 when the cycle achieved its maximum the significance of the linear regression between estimated and measured tw values was used to indicate the goodness of the fit 2 3 2 relationships between tw and auxiliary variables the most important parameter controlling water temperature is tₐ a good or bad relationship between tₐ and tw points to a small or large influence of other factors and little or large thermal inertia at that location therefore in this study we used the simple linear regression of tw on tₐ to identify the stations where tₐ exerted a greater influence on tw 6 tw a b tₐ another parameter naturally related to tw is the flow thus we analyzed the relationship between tw and the mean monthly flow qₘ at each station we used qₘ instead of the instantaneous flow at the time of tw measurement qᵢ because the monthly flow series was far more complete a logarithmic equation was selected because it showed the best fit at all stations 7 tw a b ln qₘ 2 3 3 trend analysis two parametric regression methods linear regression of tw for each individual month and harmonic analysis and one nonparametric method seasonal kendall test along with the seasonal kendall slope estimator gilbert 1987 were used to detect and estimate trends in the original tw series 2 4 linear regression by month for a given month i the linear regression of the mean monthly temperature in that month twᵢ on the year y taken as 1 for the first year in each series 8 twᵢ aᵢ bᵢ y yields a slope bᵢ that can be regarded as the trend in tw over time expressed in c yr ¹ for month i the trends in a given month i were considered significant when the slopes bᵢ were significantly different from 0 p 0 05 the intercept ai yields the value of tw in month i of year 0 that is the year right before the beginning of the analyzed series 2 5 harmonic regression analysis in the harmonic regression eq 3 tw was fitted to two cosine waves plus a trend the regression coefficient b₁ in eq 3 yields the increase decrease in tw per month c month and can be taken as the linear trend in tw at each station the trend of tw at a given station was significant if the parameter b₁ was significantly different from 0 p 0 05 2 6 seasonal kendall slope estimator the nonparametric seasonal kendall test for trend hirsch et al 1982 was used to assess the presence of significant trends p 0 05 and the seasonal kendall slope estimator based on the sen median slope estimator was used to determine the trend in each month and for the whole year hirsch et al 1982 the homogeneity of the trends among months at each station was checked using a χ2 test p 0 05 gilbert 1987 the mann kendall method mann 1945 kendall 1975 was selected because it can be used for non complete data series and without any particular distribution gilbert 1987 this method is commonly used to analyze hydrometeorological and water quality trends of variables such as flow precipitation salinity or temperature webb and nobilis 1995 kaushal et al 2010 lópez moreno et al 2011 prats et al 2007 bouza 2006 3 results the harmonic equation presented a good adjustment in the 21 stations with a significant linear relation between estimated and observed tw values r² 0 782 0 927 table 2 there were many missing data in the tw series table 1 and in addition tw observations although with monthly frequency were taken randomly in day and hour within each month the harmonic equation fills tw monthly gaps and decreases the effects due to measurements in a non representative day hour therefore the values estimated by the harmonic equation were used to calculate annual and monthly tw averages the months of maximum and minimum tw and the range difference between the maximum and minimum monthly tw at the different stations table 2 3 1 water temperature patterns in the ebro river basin 3 1 1 ebro river longitudinal analysis annual and seasonal results 3 1 1 1 tw along the ebro river axis along the ebro river main stem the mean annual tw 1975 2008 increased by 4 6 c from the first upstream station at the ebro cereceda station to the last station at ebro tortosa resulting in an average gradient of 0 6 c 100 km however this increase was not homogeneous along the river fig 2 table 2 i in the upper reaches tw increased 2 8 c between the ebro cereceda upstream of the garoña npp and ebro miranda downstream of the npp stations separated by 90 km an average increase of 3 1 c 100 km ii flowing into the ebro depression tw decreased by 1 5 c along the 201 km stretch between the ebro miranda and ebro castejón stations with an average variation of 0 7 c km and a decrease in tw opposite to the natural river behavior increasing tw downstream the contribution of the large tributaries from the left bank aragón and arga with a flow higher than the ebro river in this stretch and with a lower tw 13 4 c for the aragón caparroso station and 13 5 c for the arga peralta station could explain the decrease in tw in the ebro river from 14 3 c at lodosa to 14 0 c at castejón iii in the lower middle reaches of the ebro depression the ebro river temperature rose at a rate of 0 5 c 100 km from castejón to mequinenza from the mequinenza reservoir tw 15 9 c to the flix dam tw 15 2 c tw decreased by 0 7 c due to the discharge from the cinca segre system with lower mean tw 14 6 c for the cinca fraga station and 14 8 c for the segre serós station iv finally in the lower reaches downstream of the ascó npp the tw increased 1 9 c between the ebro flix 15 2 c and ebro ascó 17 1 c stations 4 5 c 100 km and remained high tw 17 c to the river mouth ebro tortosa station 3 1 1 2 annual range of tw along the ebro river axis the temperature range difference between the maximum and the minimum mean monthly tw increased steadily from the ebro cereceda 14 3 c station to the ebro pina 16 3 c station at a rate of 0 5 c 100 km fig 2 downstream of the ebro pina station this range increased at a rate of 2 6 c 100 km and had the highest tw range at the ebro sástago station which is the last station in the ebro depression upstream of the mequinenza reservoir the ebro sástago station is located in the most continental and driest area of the ebro river basin downstream of a reach with low slope and water speed this increase in the annual tw range down the ebro river was caused mainly by the rise of summer tw from lodosa to sástago fig 3a the ebro sástago station and the next station ebro mequinenza not affected by npps stations had the highest tw of all stations analyzed fig 2 15 9 c this effect can be attributed to the natural climatic variability which is more accused in the central reaches of the basin with a more continental climate however the increase in the annual tw range along the ebro river depression was reversed downstream of the mequinenza ribarroja flix reservoirs fig 2 as reservoirs smooth river tw webb 1988 downstream of the mequinenza reservoir tw decreased in summer and increased in winter the maximum monthly tw at sástago august was 2 0 c higher than that at mequinenza and the minimum tw january was 1 2 c lower than that at mequinenza fig 3b from september to january the ebro sástago station had a lower tw than the ebro mequinenza station and the opposite was observed from february to august fig 3b mixing in the mequinenza reservoir reduced the annual tw range to 15 0 c the tw range remained low at the flix station 14 8 c after the incorporation of the cinca segre flows but rose at the ascó station to 16 4 c only to descend downstream to 15 8 c at the xerta station and 15 7 c at the river mouth at the tortosa station table 2 fig 2 generally the maximum tw was found in august and the minimum tw was found in january only in the mequinenza reservoir did the tw minimum shift to february table 2 the reservoirs not only affected the range of the annual tw cycle but also shifted the month in which maximum and minimum tw occurred in the year at the ebro mequinenza station the minimum tw was found in february whereas from zaragoza to sástago the minimum occurred in january approximately one month before this behavior can also be appreciated through the φ1 value shift of the annual wave in the harmonic equation table 2 at the stations downstream of the reservoirs ebro mequinenza and ebro flix stations φ1 had the lowest absolute value in the basin indicating that the maximum of the annual cycle was displaced only 48 mequinenza and 50 flix days before october 1 while it was moved 68 days before that date at the ebro sástago station table 2 throughout the basin the peak of the annual tw cycle occurred 51 69 days before october 1 and this shift φ1 was highest in the tributaries except for the aragón jaca station and in the ebro depression table 2 along the ebro river this shift was higher than 56 days for all stations except for the ebro miranda and haro stations both downstream of the ebro reservoir and in the stations downstream of mequinenza showing the impact of reservoirs in reducing this shift in the central ebro depression the shift increased downstream from 57 days at lodosa to 68 days at sástago the peak of the 6 month cycles occurred before october 1 at all stations in the basin φ₂ 0 table 2 except in those downstream of the mequinenza reservoir where it occurred after that date φ₂ 0 table 2 generally the 6 month wave peaks did not follow a particular increasing or decreasing trend along the ebro river or its tributaries table 2 the maximum of the 6 month wave was found just 33 days after october 1 at the mouth of the segre segre serós station and 32 days before october 1 at the mouth of the arba arba tauste station but 72 days before that date at the mouth of the aragón aragón caparroso station table 2 along the ebro river upstream of mequinenza the maximum occurred between 6 and 52 days before october 1 with the shift being greatest at the ebro sástago station table 2 the stations located upstream and downstream of the two npps showed different tw behaviors the stations located upstream ebro cereceda station and downstream ebro miranda station of the garoña npp had similar annual ranges and cycles but the mean monthly tw at the miranda station was approximately 2 4 c higher than that at the cereceda station fig 3c on the other hand the stations upstream ebro flix station and downstream ebro ascó station of the ascó npp had different seasonal behaviors the annual range increased from the ebro mequinenza and flix stations to the ebro ascó station at 1 9 c fig 2 same increase that showed the average tw table 2 the increase in the monthly tw from the flix to ascó stations was low and constant from november to april 1 4 c and higher between june and september 2 4 2 8 c fig 3d the garoña npp effluent without a refrigeration tower discharged into the sobrón reservoir the water storage at this reservoir led to the absorption of this heat input in a similar way throughout the year minimum monthly water storage 16 0 mm³ and maximum monthly water storage 19 7 mm³ from february 1997 to the closure of the garoña npp in 2012 with some differences due to differences in the ebro river input output flow into the sobrón reservoir the period with low ebro river flow and less water input into the reservoir august to december corresponded with the higher differences in tw between the cereceda and miranda stations 3 c with a peak occurring in november 3 8 c 3 1 2 tributaries annual and seasonal results in the tributaries the mean tw and annual range increased from the headwaters to the river mouth table 2 the annual mean tw increased at a rate of 2 8 c 100 km along the aragón river from the jaca to caparroso stations and 2 0 c 100 km along the segre river from the seo to serós stations the arga river flows into the aragón at peralta arga peralta station very close to the mouth of the aragón into the ebro with a tw 13 5 c very similar to that of the aragón at its mouth 13 4 c aragón caparroso station in the same way the segre river joins the cinca a few kilometers downstream of the segre serós station very close to the cinca fraga station the tw at the segre serós station 14 8 c and cinca fraga station 14 6 c were also very similar table 2 the stations located at the river mouth of the main tributaries had similar annual tw ranges to those located in the middle reaches of the ebro river pignatelli to pina stations 16 c with the exception of the arga peralta station table 2 this station had higher tw in autumn and winter and lower tw in summer than the aragón caparroso station fig 3g another seasonal tw feature in the tributaries relative to the natural climate variability could be found at the headwater stations segre seo and aragón jaca stations where the higher flows occurred in may and june figs 3g and 3h due to snowmelt at these stations the amplitude of the six month wave φ₂ was much higher a₂ 0 8 c at jaca and 0 9 c at seo than at the rest of the stations in the basin a₂ from 0 4 c to 0 6 c table 2 pointing to a greater influence of snowmelt this fact was also shown by the evolution of tw throughout the year at both stations with a clear decrease from the annual cycle in spring figs 3g and 3h the effects of the aragón arga arba and cinca segre tributary systems on the ebro river tw were different the aragón river flows into the ebro river downstream of the ebro lodosa station and upstream of the ebro castejón station the tributary mouth stations arga peralta and aragón caparroso stations had lower tw than the ebro lodosa station in all months except for spring and it was only in this season that tw increased slightly 0 3 c from lodosa to castejón fig 3e for the rest of the year tw was higher at lodosa than at castejón with the maximum difference found in september october 0 9 c the arba river mouth station at tauste had an annual range of only 13 5 c the lowest annual range only after the aragón jaca station table 2 and quite unlike the other tributaries on the left margin aragón arga and cinca segre fig 2 on the other hand the cinca segre system discharges to the ebro river into the ribarroja reservoir downstream of the mequinenza reservoir the effect of the cinca segre discharge on the ebro river tw supersedes the effect of the mequinenza reservoir largest reservoir in the basin 1500 mm³ with a marked influence on the annual tw cycle 3 2 relationship of tw tₐ and tw streamflow all stations analyzed showed a high correlation between air temperature and water temperature tₐ and tw taken simultaneously but some differences were found between stations the linear relationship between tₐ and tw table 3 was strong r² 0 80 se 3 12 c in the ebro depression from pignatelli to sástago and at the tributary mouths arga peralta aragón caparroso cinca fraga segre serós and arba tauste stations these stations are characterized by a common physical river morphology with open valleys meandering reaches and low water velocity while their main effects come from irrigated industrial and urban areas the relationship was weaker r² 0 70 0 80 se 2 86 3 65 c at the stations downstream of the reservoirs ebro flix station and the npps ebro haro ebro ascó ebro xerta and ebro tortosa stations where the different thermal effects had a higher weight on tw than on tₐ the stations located in the headwaters aragón jaca and segre seo stations also had a weaker relationship between tw and tₐ r² 0 70 0 80 se 2 50 2 78 c in this case the effect of snowmelt in spring the different behavior of water and air at freezing temperatures in winter or even the high speed flow and changes in the tₐ with altitude could weaken this relationship the relationship between tw and tₐ was even weaker r² 0 70 se 3 22 c at the ebro miranda ebro castejón and ebro mequinenza stations at the miranda station the tw was largely controlled by garoña npp discharges and the absorption of this heat input by sobrón reservoir as shown by its seasonal behavior at the mequinenza station the heat storage in the reservoir and the altered regime of seasonal inputs and outputs controlled tw in addition to tₐ while at the castejón station tw was also affected by discharges from the aragón arga system in general the relationship between tw and flow in the ebro river and main tributaries although statistically significant was weaker than that with tₐ at all stations except for the arba tauste station tw decreased with qₘ higher flows caused lower tw the coefficient of determination at most study stations was lower than 0 50 and the standard error se was higher than 4 c table 3 the relationship between tw and flow was stronger at the stations located throughout the ebro river depression from castejón to sástago r² 0 45 se 4 10 c the ebro river stations downstream of the main reservoir and npp discharges from miranda to haro and from mequinenza to xerta had weaker relationships r² 0 30 se 4 74 c the tributaries with greater irrigation development in their basins cinca fraga and arba tauste stations had the weakest relationships at the stations at the river mouths r² 0 10 se 5 1 c for the arba river the relationship was also inverted b 0 in relation to the other stations at this station higher flows corresponded with higher tw during the summer months finally the stations in the headwaters segre seo aragón jaca and ebro cereceda stations also had very weak relationships r² 0 10 se 4 6 c 3 3 trends in water temperature in the ebro river basin the annual trend estimates using the harmonic equation and the mann kendall method m k were similar with a very strong linear relationship and coefficient of determination r² 0 976 fig 4a the monthly trends obtained by linear regression for each month and by the seasonal kendall slope estimator also showed a very strong linear relationship r² 0 949 fig 4b in both cases the slopes of the linear regressions were not significantly different from 1 and the intercepts were not significantly different from 0 p 0 95 indicating nonsignificant differences in the trends estimated by the different methods fig 4 table 4 the seasonal kendall slope estimator was chosen to evaluate the tw trends because this method i does not require normal data ii is less sensitive to outliers and iii allows for testing the homogeneity of trends in different seasons and identifying months with higher trends 3 3 1 annual trends the annual trend increased downstream on the ebro river from 0 04 c year at cereceda to 0 09 c year at tortosa showing some irregularity along the river fig 5 in the upper reaches the rate of tw increase tw rose from 0 04 c year at cereceda to 0 05 c year at miranda and haro and then declined to 0 03 c year at the next station lodosa along the ebro depression tw remained between 0 04 and 0 06 c year reaching the highest value at sástago tw 0 08 c year in the stations located in the mequinenza and flix reservoirs tw was lower than that at the upstream stations approximately 0 03 0 04 c year and finally tw showed a large increase at the last stations from ascó tw 0 12 c year where it reached the highest value in the basin to xerta tw 0 08 c year and tortosa tw 0 09 c year the thermal discharges from the npps increased the annual tw at the stations located immediately downstream the two stations immediately downstream of the garoña npp ebro miranda and ebro haro stations had higher annual trends 0 05 c year than those upstream of the ebro cereceda station 0 04 c year and downstream of the ebro lodosa station 0 03 c year table 4 in the case of the ascó npp this effect was higher tw was 0 04 c year at flix upstream of the npp but 0 12 c year at ascó downstream the mean annual tw of all stations on the ebro river was close to 0 05 c year 1 9 c increase from 1973 to 2012 while at the ebro ascó station it reached 0 12 c year equivalent to an increase of 4 5 c from 1973 to 2012 the annual trend in the middle ebro river at sástago reached 0 08 c year and decreased at the stations downstream of the reservoirs ebro mequinenza and ebro flix stations to 0 04 c year water storage in the reservoirs may have contributed to reducing the tw but although lower tw remained significant at these two stations the annual tw increased significantly at all tributary river mouth stations except the aragón caparroso station ranging from 0 03 c year in the arga and segre rivers to 0 05 c year in the arba and 0 07 c year in the cinca table 4 a general annual trend in average qm and ta was observed in all the stations in the ebro river that could be responsible for the observed trend in tw at the main ebro river stations with more completed data series ebro lodosa zaragoza and tortosa mean annual flow presented a significant trend that was estimated from 2 23 to 7 45 mm³ year table 5 fig 6 average annual tₐ trends in ebro at logroño zaragoza and tortosa aemet 2022 were significant p 0 05 and were quantified in 0 033 0 050 and 0 040 c year respectively table 5 the trend in ta was close to the trend in tw in logroño and zaragoza 0 025 and 0 054ºc year respectively but was only half of the tw trend in tortosa 0 088 c year table 4 3 3 2 seasonal trends in tw the trends in the headwaters of the ebro river from cereceda to lodosa were not homogeneous between months however monthly trends were homogeneous with an upward trend at all stations along the ebro river downstream of castejón except at the ebro pina and flix stations table 4 the trends in the headwater stations of the pyrenean tributaries aragón jaca and segre seo stations were homogeneous in all months and no significantly different from zero indicating that there was no global upward trend at the upper pyrenees stations table 4 at the downstream end of the tributaries there was a monthly homogeneous upward trend at the arga peralta segre serós and arba tauste stations but not at the aragón caparroso and cinca fraga stations table 4 the tw trends at all ebro river stations increased from autumn to spring except for february and march when some stations had lower trends table 4 and had significant upward trends from april to july being significant in may in all of them table 4 at the stations downstream of the ebro ascó station there were also many months with significant tw trends from december to march and in august september among the tributary mouth stations only the arga peralta aragón caparroso and arba tauste stations followed the pattern observed in the ebro river downstream of castejón while the segre serós station only had significant trends in october and the cinca fraga station only in march april and july to september table 4 at the pyrenean headwater stations there were only two singular months with significant trends october at the aragón jaca station and june at the segre seo station table 4 aggregating the monthly data into seasons the spring april to june average trend was higher than 0 08 c year for all stations on the ebro river except for those in the lower reach reservoirs mequinenza and flix fig 7 in all stations except the ebro mequinenza station and the downstream segre serós and cinca fraga stations and headwater segre seo and aragón jaca stations stations in the cinca segre system at least two months had significant upward trends p 0 05 in spring table 4 the highest values were at the ebro sástago station in june with an increase of 0 24 c year and the ebro ascó station with 0 14 c year for all spring months table 4 on the other hand the period with fewer months with significant tw was autumn october to december table 4 in this season all stations along the ebro river had nonsignificant trends except sástago and the last two stations xerta and tortosa in december table 4 in contrast october trends were significant and high 0 09 0 12 c year at the two stations on the aragón river caparroso and jaca the mouth of the segre river segre serós station and the arba tauste station where the trend in november was also significant table 4 during summer july to september only the stations on the ebro river downstream of the mequinenza reservoir had significant trends for more than two months with a peak at ascó in july tw 0 17 c year with respect to tributaries the cinca fraga station was the only station that had significant trends in all summer months reaching the highest value of the year 0 09 0 13 c year table 4 fig 7 finally in winter the tw trend showed similar behavior to the summer season only the stations below the ascó npp had more than two months with significant upward trends especially the ebro ascó station which had trends in the whole season above 0 14 c year in winter the ebro sástago station had two months with a significant trend unlike summer and among the stations downstream of the reservoirs only mequinenza had a significant trend in february other stations on the ebro river with significant winter trends were those situated downstream of the garoña npp miranda and haro where january tw increased by 0 07 c year table 4 among the tributary stations only the aragón jaca and cinca fraga stations had a significant trend in march table 4 fig 7 the stations located downstream of the npps ebro miranda and ebro ascó stations increased their tw in relation to the upstream stations ebro cereceda and ebro flix stations in all seasons except for autumn and summer at miranda fig 7 at miranda the tw was not significant from july to december while at ascó only the months from october to december had nonsignificant trends table 4 the highest monthly tw in the basin was found at ascó where the tw was higher than 0 11 c year from january to september table 4 which entailed an increase in tw of more than 5 c during the study period 1980 2012 during summer and winter the tw was nonsignificant for most months upstream of the ascó npp but many months had significant and very high trends at the stations from ascó downstream fig 7 which were always lower at xerta and tortosa than at ascó table 4 regarding the influence of the large reservoirs in the lower reaches the mequinenza and flix stations did not have monthly tw as high as the upstream station ebro sástago station and the downstream station ebro ascó station in any season fig 7 the monthly tw trends were significant at mequinenza only in february and may and at flix from april to august table 4 generally the monthly trends increased along the ebro river in winter spring and summer and were not as clear in autumn fig 7 in the four seasons the pattern of increasing monthly trends down the ebro river was interrupted abruptly at mequinenza where the monthly tw was generally lower than that upstream sástago this decrease in the tw along the river at mequinenza was less pronounced in winter fig 7 in spring summer and winter the trends in the tributary mouths were lower than the trends at the ebro river stations upstream of their mouths except for the cinca fraga station in summer and winter fig 7 in contrast during autumn the tw was higher in the tributaries than at the stations immediately upstream of their confluence fig 7 the mouth stations of the aragón arga system and the arba river had significant trends mainly in spring and around october whereas the cinca segre system had a different behavior at its mouth with no significant trends at the segre serós station except for october and significant trends mainly during summer and march april at the cinca fraga station table 4 fig 7 the seasonal tw trends were similar to those present in qm and tₐ in the 3 stations where these parameters were analyzed fig 6 table 5 the stations at the ebro river lodosa zaragoza and tortosa showed a significant decrease in monthly flows that were estimated from 1 9 to 17 8 mm³ year from april to july the only spring month without any significant flow trend was may table 5 the meteorological stations analyzed logroño zaragoza and tortosa presented the same behaviors for tₐ with significant trends from 0 06 c year to 0 10 c year in all months from april to june except for logroño in june all these slopes were lower than the tw trends at the closer quality stations table 4 and table 5 october also showed an upward ta trend in the 3 stations table 5 while it was a month in which no significant trend was observed in tw in any station along the ebro river table 4 4 discussion all recent studies have noted a clear increase in air temperature in the last century that should affect water temperatures ipcc 2022 in this work we found that tw in the ebro river has increased in most of the study stations over the last 40 years it is difficult to define what part of these tw changes should be attributed to the evolution of tₐ and what part should be attributed to other factors such as reservoir construction and management increases in water consumption land use changes such as irrigation development or thermal discharges among others apparently the behavior of tw throughout the study period was not the result of any single specific environmental or anthropogenic change it must have been a combination of all of them the tw at the ebro river stations with similar kinds of effects showed a common behavior the mequinenza ribarroja flix reservoir system caused a decrease in the tw annual range at the downstream stations the spring and summer tw values decreased while the autumn and winter tw values increased dolz et al 1996 also found differences of more than 5 c in the mean tw between the upstream reach of the mequinenza reservoir and downstream of the flix dam using continuous tw measurements from june to july 1990 this lower temperature water discharge from the mequinenza reservoir increased its temperature at a rate of 0 2 c km downstream in the higher insolation hours until the river regained its natural tw prats et al 2010 measured tw at 9 control stations along the lower reaches of the ebro river from the mequinenza reservoir to xerta and the segre cinca river mouths from 1997 to 2003 at 10 minute intervals they found that the annual tw range changed along this reach the range was 3 c smaller downstream of the reservoirs with the temperature cycle lagging 20 days in relation to the upstream stations they showed how tw decreased in spring summer with a maximum decrease of 3 5 4 0 c in june july and increased in autumn winter with a peak increase of 3 0 3 5 c in november in relation to the nonaffected upper reaches these authors also noted that the cinca segre immediately upstream of the ribarroja reservoir contributed to the reservoir tw stratification in spring and summer months and raised the tw in the reservoir outflow this could in turn have reduced the cooling ability of these waters upon the ascó npp effluents during summer in this study similar results to those of prats et al 2010 were found at stations below reservoirs the annual range at flix downstream of the reservoirs was 3 2 c lower than that at sástago upstream of the mequinenza reservoir the summer mean tw at the flix station was 3 3 c lower than that at sástago with maximum differences found in july 3 8 c and the autumn mean tw at flix was 2 5 c higher with maximum differences occurring in november 3 1 c finally this study showed that the maximum and minimum tw at the downstream stations occurred one month later compared to the upstream stations it must be considered that the difference in tw between the sástago and flix stations was not a consequence of the mequinenza reservoir regulation alone the high flow discharge from the cinca segre river with lower mean tw than the ebro mequinenza station immediately upstream of the ribarroja reservoir also affected the tw of the ribarroja output this difference was also higher because the sástago station had a particularly high tw range compared to other stations in the ebro depression if the annual range at flix is compared to the range at the ebro river stations from pignatelli to pina all of them located in the ebro depression upstream of sástago the difference decreased to only 1 5 c the reservoir system led to a decrease in tw trends at downstream stations thus the lowest annual trends were observed at the ebro flix tw 0 041 c year and mequinenza stations tw 0 036 c year nuclear power plant discharges produced a significant increase in tw the highest increases were found during the summer months in the case of the ascó npp 2 7 c matching the lowest flow period in the case of the garoña npp the tw increase was more homogeneous throughout the year with higher values from august to december 3 c the different effects of the two npps on the ebro river tw patterns could be explained by the differences in streamflow and the effect of the sobrón reservoir streamflow was 6 times higher at the ebro ascó station than at the ebro miranda station around the ascó npp the highest flows in winter and spring december to may matched the lowest differences in tw between the flix and ascó stations fig 3d in these months the heat discharge from the ascó npp was absorbed by the ebro river more easily and thus the difference in tw between the two stations remained relatively low the lower flow during the summer months in the ebro river diminished the ability of the river to absorb the thermal discharges from the ascó npp leading to higher differences during summer between the flix and ascó stations table 2 fig 3d the effects of the ascó npp on the ebro river tw was studied by prats et al 2010 these authors concluded that the discharges from this npp increased the annual tw by approximately 3 c 1998 2003 the variability along the year depended on the ebro river discharge tw increase was more noticeable in low flow periods and additionally on the ascó npp management the mean tw difference between the ebro flix and ebro ascó stations was 2 0 c with a higher difference from june to september 2 4 2 8 c coinciding with low ebro river flows the lower differences obtained in this work coincided with a longer tw series 1975 2008 than in prats et al 2010 which took into account some cold tw years before ascó npp activity alberto and arrúe 1986 estimated an increase in the ebro river tw of 3 c associated with the garoña npp effluent calculated from the npp input and ebro river flow they observed that the flow weighted mean tw increased at miranda from 9 3 c before the start of the garoña npp 1960 1971 to 12 3 c thereafter 1972 1982 they concluded that tw in the river downstream of the garoña npp decreased by thermal dissipation to water and air and due to the thermal storage in the sobrón reservoir in this study the difference in annual mean tw between cereceda and miranda was 2 8 c half a degree higher than the difference observed by alberto and arrúe 1986 at the same stations 2 3 c from 1972 to 1982 this difference can be attributed to the tw trends observed the annual trend at cereceda was lower than that at miranda thus increasing the difference in tw between the two stations with time except for garoña npp effluents there is no other plausible origin for the ebro miranda station high tw there are no high flowing tributaries groundwater or urban main discharges or large reservoirs the water storage in the sobrón reservoir did not seem to be enough to absorb the garoña heat effluent and to bring the ebro river back to its natural tw the highest annual tw trend was observed at the ebro ascó station tw 0 12 c year this high value can only be explained by the npp activity since 1985 however it is important to mention that the temperature series at the ebro ascó station started in 1980 thus including 5 years with no discharges from the ascó npp these first 5 years with lower tw values may have led to the calculation of higher tw trends excluding the first 5 years from the analysis the annual trend was 0 08 c year and remained within the same range as the other lower ebro river stations from sástago to tortosa except for the reservoir stations table 4 irrigation return flows produced an increase in tw but this behavior was not clear at all stations affected by the return flows from irrigated areas the mean annual tw and annual range at the arba tauste station were lower than those at other stations with similar climatic characteristics the arba river basin is located in a semiarid area in the middle ebro depression and its headwaters do not originate from the pyrenees but from the lower pre pyrenean range fig 1 the arba river is also the main collector of the irrigation return flows of the bardenas irrigation scheme which moved the maximum flow to the spring and summer period during the irrigation season fig 3f additionally the irrigation water for the arba river basin is diverted from the aragón river at the yesa reservoir in the aragón river headwaters fig 1 this cold water was applied to the fields during the summer months contributing to reducing the summer tw and consequently to lessening the annual range fig 3f alberto and arrúe 1986 found that the arba tauste station had higher thermal storage by unit mass than other stations in the surrounding area they attributed this feature to the high flow during the irrigation season and not to warmer irrigation return flows they attributed the different tw between the arba tauste station and other stations to the supply of cool irrigation water and to the effects of evaporation and the cooling of the soils by irrigation water it must be considered that most of the arba irrigated land is flood irrigated 78 with low irrigation efficiency 62 lorenzo gonzález 2022 arga peralta station had higher tw in autumn and winter and lower tw in summer than aragón caparroso station fig 3g in contrast with other tributaries there is not much agricultural area in the arga river basin 5500 ha in 1999 2 and 10 700 ha in 2009 4 ine 2009 in addition there are no major reservoirs along the arga river only the minor alloz 65 mm³ and eugui 22 mm³ reservoirs in the headwaters and the main populated areas pamplona are located 90 km upstream of the arga peralta station these natural features and the smaller anthropogenic effects in the arga basin as compared with other tributary basins aragón cinca and segre may lead to lower temperature range and amplitude at its mouth the different tw values at the tributary mouth stations suggest a link between the tw trend and irrigation development irrigated surfaces account for 16 and 28 of the total basin surface in the cinca and arba rivers respectively with higher tw increases while irrigated land is 7 in the aragón arga basin and 10 in the segre river basin irrigated land area elaborated with data from che 2022 with lower tw increases table 4 the discharges of the main tributaries affected tw in the ebro river the aragón river inputs decreased the mean annual tw and the annual temperature range in the ebro river however this behavior changed between seasons and depended on the difference in tw between the ebro and aragón rivers and the flow ratios tw in the ebro river decreased from summer to winter and increased in spring alberto and arrúe 1986 found that the aragón jaca station and yesa reservoir had not attained a tₐ tw equilibrium due to the high difference between tₐ and tw and to the high flow speed of this mountain river these authors concluded that the storage time in the yesa reservoir was not enough to reach equilibrium in temperature and that the aragón river probably would not reach this equilibrium all the way down to the mouth except in spring when the tw in the aragón river is similar or even higher than that at the ebro lodosa station furthermore the ebro river at the aragón river discharge point had an abnormally high temperature produced by the garoña npp thermal effluent as mentioned above and did not reach tₐ tw equilibrium for more than 150 km downstream from the garoña npp alberto and arrúe 1986 the headwater stations aragón jaca and segre seo basically controlled by natural climate variability exhibited a particular tw behavior linked to snowmelt for these stations the increase in tw during spring months from april to june was lower than that at the stations at the river mouths which matched the higher thawing flows arrúe and alberto 1986 found a relationship between flow and tw that was unrelated to tₐ on the ebro river at escatrón close to the sástago station they attributed this relationship to episodes of river floods produced by snowmelt alberto and arrúe 1986 found that the annual tw in the pyrenean headwaters was lower than tₐ with a difference of more than 1 5 c at the aragón jaca station and in the yesa reservoir this difference could also be observed at lower altitude stations as a result of the water origin and the high flow velocity in these kinds of rivers the best stations to analyze tw effects by water diversion are located in the ebro river lower reach at xerta and tortosa 14 km downstream the xerta weir diverts more than 1200 mm³ year at a high flow rate 40 m³ s during the irrigation season april to october during summer the ebro river flow upstream of the xerta weir is approximately 200 m³ s and it is in this period when abstraction effects should be more noticeable downstream of the weir with a closer tw tₐ relationship and an increase in tw and tₐ that should result in a higher annual range downstream of the xerta weir the river would have less thermal capacity lower flow velocity and higher residence time that would make the river more sensitive to summer high tₐ nevertheless the difference between stations was not particularly high and missing data at the ebro xerta station in some years did not allow for a comparison between both stations in general annual tw trends increased from the upper reaches to the river mouths in the ebro river and its tributaries although some of these trends were nonsignificant average of the mean annual significant trends was 0 05 c year there was also a clear seasonal behavior in the trends the spring months had the highest significant trend mean monthly tw 0 10 c year at most stations bouza deaño et al 2008 studied the trends estimated by the seasonal kendall slope estimator of 34 chemical and physical parameters at 13 ebro river stations from a shorter data series 1981 2004 they found a significant tw increase at most stations with a mean trend of 0 08 c year these authors found the highest tw at the ebro zaragoza station 0 18 c year threefold the value found in this study 0 05 c year followed by sástago 0 16 c year these authors also found a clearly lower trend at the reservoir stations 0 03 c year and higher increases downstream of the ascó npp 0 08 c year versus 0 12 c year in this work these differences may be attributed to the different periods of the data series alberto and arrúe 1986 found for the lower ebro river at escatrón close to sástago an increase of 0 08 c year for the annual flow weighed average tw 1955 1978 and prats et al 2007 with a more complete data series 1955 2000 obtained an increase of 0 05 c year at the same station it is difficult to compare this information with that obtained in this work at the ebro sástago station 0 08 c year because of the different data periods nevertheless the trends were significant in the three studies indicating a persistent temperature increase since the 1950 s the general behavior in tw could be related to the apparent flow trends in the ebro river basin the highly regulated rivers had a decreasing trend in flow during spring and the increase in tw was highest in spring the progressive increase in the regulated flow in the ebro river basin during these years resulted in higher volumes of stored water in spring decreasing the river flow lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 found a decrease in discharge in more than 90 of the gauging stations in the ebro river basin following the increase in water consumption by agriculture and urban and industrial uses and the extension of natural vegetation in the basin headwaters at the expense of traditional agriculture lópez moreno et al 2011 also álvarez cabria et al 2016 applied a forest model to study the spatial and seasonal variability of water quality in the ebro river basin and found that an increase in forest cover reduced the mean annual tw the result has been an increase in tw as more heat resulting from rising tₐ must be absorbed by less water resulting from lower flows lower flows also increase water travel times which induces lower thermal inertia prats et al 2010 in this work all stations along the ebro river and especially the ebro in tortosa showed a decreasing flow the decrease in flows matched the increase in tw observed in the 1970 s to the 1990 s pointing to a possible contribution of the flow decrease upon the tw trends additionally global warming has induced a progressive decrease in snow storage in the ebro river basin in the last 50 years magrama 2008 lópez moreno and garcía ruiz 2004 in mountainous areas of the ebro river basin the increase in tₐ has led to a higher ratio of rainfall to snowfall thus accelerating snowmelt lópez moreno et al 2011 the displacement of the peak melting flow to the early spring ipcc 2022 lópez moreno et al 2011 and the progressive decrease in snow storage magrama 2008 lópez moreno and garcía ruiz 2004 due to global warming also introduced less cold water during spring months this effect is felt in the upper and middle ebro river reaches where the minimum tw are found during the high flows originating from snowmelt arrúe and alberto 1986 accordingly the highest and most significant trends in tw were found in the spring months 5 future tasks the prognosis for the first half of the century in the ebro river basin is not promising air temperature is expected to increase by a mean of 1 5 1 6 c with a maximum value in summer of 2 8 c magrama 2010 and precipitation although there has been no clear trend in recent decades de castro et al 2005 lópez moreno et al 2011 garcía vera et al 2002 is supposed to decrease between 3 and 4 magrama 2010 in this context the ebro river semiarid reaches with low flow velocity less area protected by riparian vegetation and a large exposed surface would experience the highest tw increases due to climate change the analysis of river flows is also important many of the natural and anthropogenic factors affecting tw in the ebro river including climate change may also be altered by the reduction in river discharge there is an apparent relationship between the evolution of tw in the ebro river and its tributaries rising trend and the evolution of their flows decreasing trend future studies may focus on elucidating how the changes in river flows interfere with the tw tₐ relationship how they affect the heat transport capacity of rivers and how these changes may aggravate some tw effects such as urban or industrial thermal discharges furthermore clear links were found between tw and tₐ at all stations but the strength of this link is different at different stations reaches of rivers and regions in the basin stations downstream of major dams pyrenean headwaters etc additional research should be conducted to establish the nature and causes of these differences there are other factors affecting the ebro river tw such as the groundwater supply and its thermal characteristics the right bank tributaries exert important tw control due to this effect in the ebro river basin alberto and arrúe 1986 however given that these rivers do not contribute high discharges to the ebro river they were not included in this study these groundwater controls could be included at a further stage in the analysis of the ebro river water temperature regime further consideration may be given to the selection of the sampling hour and day within the month to obtain adequate readings close to the average tw of the month the continuous 15 minute interval data of the saica network of the che che 2021b provide substantial information at some stations to help in the selection of the right sampling time for tw isidoro et al 2013 6 conclusions along the ebro river the tw regime is markedly influenced by the effluents of the garoña and ascó npps and the tampering effect of the mequinenza ribarroja flix reservoir system the larger tributaries on the left bank aragón arga and cinca segre rivers also exert a noticeable influence compared to these factors the influence of irrigation return flows and irrigation development on water temperature was low the flow regime and climate change are also factors that have a clear influence on tw especially during spring the influence of tₐ on tw was more pronounced at the stations along the ebro river depression pignatelli to sástago and at the mouth of the main tributaries aragón arga arba segre and cinca rivers this influence was lower at the stations affected by npp effluents or downstream of the main reservoirs and in the pyrenean headwaters aragón jaca and segre seo stations water temperature was therefore better related to tₐ in the lower reaches of rivers under natural conditions where low summer flows coincided with the highest tₐ indicating that this relationship might be linked to the relationship between tw and qₘ river flow showed a weaker relationship with tw but the pattern of the link between tw and qₘ throughout the stations was similar to that of tₐ tw lower tw was linked to higher qₘ at all stations except the arba tauste station the station in which summer flows were essentially dominated by irrigation return flows there was an average annual upward trend in tw only the stations in the pyrenean headwaters aragón jaca and segre seo stations and the aragón caparroso station did not show significant annual trends the magnitude of this trend increased downstream along the ebro river with peak values at the npp affected stations and lower values at reservoir affected stations climate change and flow trends are also factors that must be considered in studying the seasonal behavior and trends of tw the decrease in spring flows due to increased river regulation has reduced the cooling effect of spring snowmelt whereas global warming has accelerated the thawing process these factors explained the seasonal tw trend patterns the monthly trends were highest and most significant during spring at all stations along the ebro river on the other hand low and nonsignificant seasonal tw trends were found in autumn except for the significant slopes found in the tributaries in october credit authorship contribution statement marian lorenzo gonzález methodology formal analysis data curation writing original draft dolores quilez writing review editing
