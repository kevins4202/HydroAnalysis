15780,harmful algal blooms habs worldwide are experiencing obvious changes under the combined impacts of global warming eutrophication and other driving forces in the east china sea ecs large scale blooms caused by dinoflagellates occurred since 2000 and there has been an apparent shift of bloom causative microalgae from diatoms to dinoflagellates to predict the future evolution of habs in this region a model was developed based on the competition between diatoms and dinoflagellates which would serve to reproduce the seasonal succession of microalgal blooms driven by multiple environmental factors the evolution features of habs were then projected under different scenarios of eutrophication and global warming under the business as usual scenario dinoflagellate blooms are expected to become more frequent with higher peak biomass concentrations over the next 30 years changes in nutrient composition of the changjiang riverine discharge may largely give rise to this phenomenon and accelerated warming associated with climate change may result in earlier occurrence of dinoflagellate blooms to prevent further intensification of dinoflagellate blooms efforts could be made to reduce nitrogen inputs and maintain or even increase silicate inputs from the changjiang river graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords harmful algal bloom warming eutrophication east china sea prediction ecological modelling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction apparent changes of harmful algal blooms habs such as those in their distribution frequency geographic scale and causative agent have been demonstrated worldwide anderson et al 2002 hallegraeff et al 2021 considerable efforts have been expended into defining potential responses of habs to global change especially global warming and nutrients glibert 2020 wells et al 2015 for instance using high resolution sea surface temperature records and temperature dependent growth rates of two algal species gobler et al 2017 indicated that increasing ocean temperature could be an important factor facilitating the intensification of habs in north america based on 50 year 1960 2009 time series data of diatoms and dinoflagellates in the northeast atlantic and north sea hinder et al 2012 found a marked increase in the relative abundance of diatoms vs dinoflagellates driven by the effects of both increasing sea surface temperature and increasing wind stress conditions in summer in parallel anthropogenic nutrient over enrichment has driven significant changes in nutrient concentrations and composition which have altered the occurrence of habs coupled with rising temperature eutrophication has driven an increase in hab incidence in the freshwater to marine continuum paerl et al 2018 glibert 2020 suggested that concurrent climate and nutrient changes were likely to favor mixotrophic microalgae over diatoms therefore previous studies underscore the need for more in depth consideration of hab responses to nutrient pollution and global warming with increasing understanding of the mechanisms underlying habs greater effort has been directed to studies of hab prediction some changes including the expansion of warm water species species specific changes in the abundance and seasonal growth window of hab taxa earlier peak production of some phytoplankters and poleward migration of habs were expected gobler et al 2017 griffith et al 2019 hallegraeff 2010 due to lack of reliable methods and a surprising scarcity of data prediction of habs in response to global change however is still fraught with uncertainties gobler 2020 wells et al 2020 additionally the consequences of environmental changes are synergistic but the complex interactions among environmental factors were rarely considered in climate simulation scenarios for the lack of real time data ralston and moore 2020 wells et al 2015 there is one key certainty habs will continue to occur in an anthropogenically altered ocean and the final outcomes of changing trends in habs remain poorly understood in temperate waters bloom succession from diatoms to various flagellate species from spring to early summer is a common phenomenon sommer et al 2012 diatom dinoflagellate ratio which reflects the dominance of diatoms or dinoflagellates during the phytoplankton spring bloom was suggested as a core indicator on the marine strategy framework directive msfd helcom 2016 in the east china sea ecs coastal waters adjacent to the changjiang river estuary ce have undergone exacerbated habs and an apparent shift of major bloom forming species from diatoms to dinoflagellates occurred around the year 2000 zhou et al 2008 extensive field observations have been conducted in this region which provided not only a sufficient database for long term studies but also a baseline against which future changes can be assessed based on historical observations marked changes in eutrophication and warming contributed to the dramatic increase in microalgal biomass with a decreasing diatom dinoflagellate ratio particularly in spring jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 besides previous works revealed that seasonal variations in environmental conditions altered the succession of dominant microalgae and promoted the growth of dinoflagellates in the ecs zhou et al 2017a b further assumption was made in this study that the selection of seasonal fluctuations over several decades is responsible for the increasing dominance of dinoflagellate blooms in the past decades in accord with this logic the evolution of habs could be projected based on analyses of competitions between the two types of microalgal blooms under different scenarios of eutrophication and warming in this study a zero dimensional numerical model was established to focus on the temporal succession of two dominant microalgal taxa in coastal ecs waters based on the model the succession processes of spring blooms were simulated in two typical years and a global sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate how the variations in model outputs can be attributed to variations in the different environmental factors furthermore a set of scenario analyses were conducted to explore the evolving trend of habs in the near future under the ongoing regional trend of increasing eutrophication and ocean warming results will offer a relevant and useful case study to improve current understanding of the evolving trend in algal bloom development and composition as well as support the development of prevention strategies for large scale dinoflagellate blooms which may also applicable to other temperate waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area coastal waters adjacent to the ce is located in the center of the chinese eastern coast fig 1 a freshwater runoff from the changjiang river coastal currents along mainland china ecs coastal current and yellow sea coast current the taiwan warm current twc from the taiwan strait and a near shore branch of the kuroshio current nkbc extending from northeast taiwan affect this area jiang et al 2014 lv et al 2006 zhou et al 2008 according to the monitoring data from 1933 to 2017 ecs environmental monitoring a significant change in the frequency of habs occurred around 2000 in the study area fig 1c 2 2 data sources and processing in situ environmental data including temperature nutrient and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations in the coastal area adjacent to the ce were sourced from field cruises conducted in 2002 2005 2010 2016 and 2018 the cruises were organized along nine transects and at 49 independent stations from march to june fig 1b water samples were collected at different depths with niskin bottles phytoplankton cells for determination of chl a were filtered onto glass fiber whatman gf f filters 25 mm diameter nominal pore size 0 68 Âµm and chl a was extracted with 90 acetone and determined with a fluorescence method water samples for nutrient analysis were filtered through glass fiber filters and determined colorimetrically temperature was measured with a conductivity temperature depth recorder sbe37 ctd monthly averaged solar radiation data were obtained from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep 27 6 on 29 5 n 121 87 oe 123 75 e additionally buoy datasets of sea water temperature and chl a determined from sept 2009 to nov 2016 were used to fill missing values of the field dataset the positions of two buoys were marked by triangles in fig 1b the characteristics of stratification and water masses during diatom and dinoflagellate blooms were analyzed based on field observation which indicated that both types of microalgal blooms occurred in the coastal region above the pycnocline at a depth of 20 m zhou et al 2019 therefore the high risk region of diatom and dinoflagellate blooms was assumed as homogeneous box in this study daily averaged values of nutrients and chl a in 2005 and 2011 were calculated to assess the model s ability to capture the seasonal succession characteristics of habs the monthly averaged values of the environmental variables were calculated and shown as green circles in fig 2 historical data of nutrient concentrations sea water temperature and solar radiation in waters adjacent to the ce nutrient concentrations of the changjiang riverine discharge were obtained from the published record duan et al 2008 ge et al 2020 jiang et al 2014 li et al 2014 2012 2007 sun et al 2009 wang 2006 wang et al 2021 ye et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 monthly variation of changjiang river runoff at the datong station was sourced from the changjiang water resources commission ministry of water resources http www cjw gov cn relative to the riverine discharge changes in nutrient inputs from atmospheric deposition over the past 30 years were reported as negligible zhao and wang 2007 similarly the intrusion of the nkbc was reported to have an 8 year periodicity in strength but no obvious long term trend wang and oey 2014 based on the historical data shown as gray circles in fig 2 polynomial fitting was performed to obtain the evolution trend of environmental conditions which provided the basis for predictions shown as red solid lines in fig 2 2 3 model development a numerical model as an extension of a zero dimensional model established by zhou et al 2017b was developed to simulate the temporal dynamics of the diatom and dinoflagellate blooms this model contains nine state variables five nutrients dissolved organic nitrogen don dissolved organic phosphate dop dissolved inorganic nitrogen din mainly nitrate dissolved inorganic phosphate dip mainly phosphate dissolved silicate disi mainly silicate two phytoplankton functional groups biomass of diatoms and dinoflagellates is expressed as chl a and detritus detritus nitrogen dptn and detritus silicate dptsi the ecological processes include photosynthesis respiration exudation and mortality of diatoms and dinoflagellates mineralization of dissolved organic nutrients decomposition and dissolution of detritus the equations corresponding to these processes are introduced in appendix a and a model schematic is shown in fig 3 the numerical model was implemented with matlab and included 224 programming statements and 35 parameters as listed in appendix b most of the parameters are based on the values given in zhou et al 2017b with some additions based on previous experimental results mutshinda et al 2013 suzuki and takahashi 1995 xu et al 2010 in situ data of chl a temperature light intensity and three species of inorganic nutrients were used to optimize model performance changes of state variables chl a nitrate phosphate and silicate were calculated by inputting time series data of the independent variables temperature light intensity and nutrient source input temperature and light intensity data were the results of consecutive linear interpolation initial chl a concentrations for diatoms and dinoflagellates were set at 0 7 and 0 3 g l 1 respectively initial values of nitrate phosphate silicate don and dop were set as the average values of field observations this model uses three nutrient source as inputs including the changjiang discharge atmospheric deposition and the intrusion of open sea water evolution of the nutrient load in the ce from 2004 to 2016 was examined against field data which indicated that the changjiang discharge showed relatively stable seasonal variation and was the dominant force driving nutrient dynamics wang et al 2020 in this study the specific values of the riverine nutrient concentration daily flux and sampling volume were considered to calculate the net nutrient input from the changjiang discharge the nutrient input in may was set as 40 of the total value to reflect the normalized diversion of cdw lie et al 2003 atmospheric deposition is an important contributor to changjiang riverine nutrients but only in summer chen et al 2019 the nutrient input from atmospheric deposition was therefore set as a fixed value and its seasonal changes were partly derived from the input flux of riverine nutrients the nkbc conveys the phosphate from the deep sea to bottom water off the coast of zhejiang and upwelling further delivers phosphate to surface water yang et al 2013 the supplement of nutrients from the open sea water was calculated according to the velocity and distribution of upwelling and the nutrient concentration in bottom water to evaluate model performance simulated values of chl a and nutrient were compared with field data in 2005 and 2011 the coefficient of determination r2 and the slope of the corresponding linear fit were calculated as most of the model parameters were based on previous study zhou et al 2017b the model outputs such as the variations in diatom and dinoflagellate biomass were mainly controlled by the input environmental factors in order to quantify the amount of variance that each environmental factors contributes to the unconditional variance of the model output sobol sensitivity analysis was performed with matlab pianosi et al 2016 sobol 1990 2 4 model simulation experiments ten model simulation experiments were designed to predict the trend in the evolution of habs in the next 30 years and try to identify quantitative prevention strategies for large scale dinoflagellate blooms for each of the separate experiments the model was re initialized for the first day by imposing the adjusted conditions described in table 1 the model was then run forward from 1950 until the end of 2050 changes beyond the year 2050 were not projected because it is unclear whether phytoplankton will adapt to future niches over time irwin et al 2015 indicated by the daily average and maximum chl a concentration during the entire spring bloom from march to july the relative abundance of diatoms and dinoflagellates were compared to illustrate the experimental results for each case in scenario 1 prediction of long term changes in the spring bloom was performed based on linear fitted values of the riverine nutrient input the local nutrient concentration temperature and light intensity in the coastal area adjacent to the ce multispatial convergent cross mapping multispatial ccm was performed based on the simulated results in scenario 1 to evaluate non linear interactions between diatoms and dinoflagellates clark et al 2015 scenarios 2 and 3 were designed to forecast the evolution of habs in the coastal area adjacent to the ce under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 tan et al 2018 additionally scenario 4 was designed to simulate the evolution of habs under extreme warming acceleration with a long term temperature rise rate of about 1 c per decade belkin 2009 belkin and lee 2014 tang et al 2009 scenarios 5 to 10 were designed to formulate a nutrient regulation strategy to prevent large scale dinoflagellate blooms 3 results 3 1 model performance the simulated seasonal variations of chl a nitrate phosphate and silicate are shown in fig 4 the succession from diatoms to dinoflagellates during the spring bloom in 2005 fig 4a and 2011 fig 4b was reproduced with two peaks of chl a variations of nitrate phosphate and silicate concentrations were also reproduced and were generally identical with observations except for nitrate the simulated concentrations of phosphate and silicate were lower than the observations as no field data of organic forms of nitrogen n and phosphorus p were available the mechanism of nutrient supplementation invoked in this model was hypothetically simplified and this may give rise to the relatively lower simulation results obtained additionally to evaluate the effects of inorganic nutrient supply on the underlying succession processes of the spring bloom the utilization of organic forms of n and p by dinoflagellates was represented by increasing the nutrient limiting tolerance of dinoflagellates such that a small change in inorganic nutrients could result in a large change in dinoflagellate biomass thus there was a more pronounced reduction in dinoflagellates than diatoms when the inorganic nutrients were low in addition it is a limitation that the simulation did not evaluate the spatial dependencies in environmental conditions or their roles on the spatial variability in habs as the high risk region of habs was treated as a homogeneous box in this study the basic outcome of the sobol sensitivity analysis including the normalized first order and total sensitivity index for the input environmental factors were shown in fig 5 phosphate concentration in the ecs ecs dip was the most sensitive input factor for the growth of diatoms as it had the highest first and total order index for the daily averaged and maximum values of diatom biomass nitrate concentration in the ecs was the most sensitive input factor for the growth of dinoflagellate for the daily averaged values of dinoflagellate biomass the differences between the first and total indices of ecs dip indicated obvious interactions between ecs dip and the other input factors the computation of the second order sensitivity indices had been performed for all the input factors and they were each evaluated for combinations with the other factors shown as pattern plots in appendix c besides ecs dip the concentration of silicate in the ecs the concentration of nutrients and the flux of changjiang yangtze river temperature and light intensity had second order sensitivity indices to the simulated maximum values of dinoflagellate biomass which indicated noticeable indirect roles of these factors 3 2 analysis of different scenarios changes of the spring bloom since 1950 were reproduced in scenario 1 and the changing trend supported the hypothesis that dinoflagellate blooms would become the dominant type of bloom in the study area figs 6 a and b the magnitude of the dinoflagellate bloom became larger than that of diatoms after 2000 which suggested that the year 2000 was a critical juncture for the evolution from a diatom dominated to a dinoflagellate dominated phase results of maltispatial ccm shown in appendix d suggested that the interactions between diatoms and dinoflagellates increased from 1950s pearson correlation coefficient Ï goes to 0 4 during the period from 1950 to 1975 to 2000s Ï goes to 0 9 during the period from 2000 to 2020 and kept high until 2050s Ï goes to 0 8 during the period from 2025 to 2050 simulation results of daily averaged chl a concentrations indicated that the ratio of diatoms to dinoflagellates varied continuously in parallel with changes in environmental conditions and the advantage of dinoflagellates became more pronounced in the following 30 years therefore if the intrusion flux and nutrient concentration of changjiang diluted water cdw continued to change following the previous trend dinoflagellates would be expected to increasingly dominate the spring bloom leading to the consequent aggravation of dinoflagellate blooms with the impacts of accelerated warming combined with eutrophication the dinoflagellate bloom would appear earlier and attain a higher biomass in scenarios 2 3 and 4 the increase in peak dinoflagellate abundance was accelerated but daily averaged biomass values were clearly reduced when temperature increased under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 and at rate of 1 c per decade figs 6c d and e reduction of the nutrient input is a feasible management strategy to prevent large scale dinoflagellate blooms especially the efforts focusing on the adjustment of the nutrient composition when the concentration of all nutrient species remained unchanged at 2020 levels the increase in temperature and light intensity and the decrease in the cdw water flux did not result in notable variation in the blooms of diatoms or dinoflagellates fig 6f in turn when nutrient concentrations decreased to half of 2020 levels through 2050 the phytoplankton biomass obviously decreased fig 6g relative to the decrease in diatoms changes in dinoflagellates were negligible in scenario 7 when the nitrate concentrations in the cdw and ecs were set at 2020 levels and the other conditions continued to change following the previous trend the magnitude of the decrease in diatoms and increase in dinoflagellates became more pronounced and the advantage of dinoflagellates continued to increase fig 6h in scenario 8 when the nitrate concentration decreased over time until it reached one half of 2020 levels by 2050 the phytoplankton biomass exhibited a decreasing trend and the reduction in diatoms was more apparent fig 6i in scenario 9 when the nitrate concentration decreased to half of 2020 levels by 2050 and the silicate was set at 2020 levels the decrease in dinoflagellates was more obvious than that of diatoms fig 6j finally in scenario 10 when the nitrate concentration decreased to half of 2020 levels and the silicate concentration increased by a factor of two by 2050 the biomass of diatoms increased and was paralleled by an obvious reduction in that of dinoflagellates such that the former eventually exceeded the later fig 6k 4 discussion characterized by high industrialization and urbanization the coastal area adjacent to the ce is facing progressive eutrophication the changjiang river is the major pathway of nutrient input from this area to the ecs liu et al 2018 its n and p load has increased ca seven to eightfold since the 1960s chen et al 2012 but the silicate concentration decreased gradually after impoundment of the three gorges dam tgd wang et al 2021 accordingly the n p ratio has been steadily increasing and the si n ratio has been decreasing in the coastal area adjacent to the ce jiang et al 2014 moon et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 in the near future nutrient related signs of eutrophication could continue to worsen in coastal waters adjacent to the ce if the nitrate concentration of the cdw increases at the same rate as in past decades the predicted nitrate load in 2050 would be twice that in 2000 whereas the silicate concentration is expected to continue to decrease this would cause a further increase of the n p ratio and decrease of the si n ratio in the region temperature effects of phytoplankton growth and composition are more important in shallow coastal waters which experience larger temperature fluctuations than oceanic waters according to the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar5 the global surface temperature change for the end of the 21st century 2081 2100 is projected to exceed 1 5 c under intermediate and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 ipcc2014 the ecs as a large marine ecosystem suffers the most rapid warming at rates 2 4 times the global mean belkin 2009 the results of linear fitting based on the historical records indicated that the sst has increased by 0 76 c at 95 confidence interval in the period of 1960 2020 and it was projected to increase continuously at a rate of 0 13 c per decade furthermore according to the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 the ecs sea surface was projected to increase by 1 47 c and 2 10 c by the middle of the 21st century 2050 2060 relative to historical observations 1980 2005 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively tan et al 2018 additionally along with global warming and strengthening of transport by the twc due to enhanced kuroshio tang et al 2009 warming of the ecs was reported to be accelerating from 1982 to 2003 at a rate of up to 1 00 c per decade belkin 2009 the observational and satellite data of seawater temperature recorded from 1957 to 2001 and 1985 to 2002 respectively has confirmed this increasing trend wang et al 2013 predictions of the response of habs to eutrophication and ocean warming have been previously attempted in the ecs but most of prior studies did not differentiate the types of microalgal blooms in this study competitions between diatoms and dinoflagellates were considered in an ecological model to simulate the respective responses of these two types of common microalgal blooms under the business as usual scenario a forecasting simulation spanning the next 30 years predicted that dinoflagellate blooms will be aggravated since the n p ratio increased and si n ratio decreased in the cdw the chemical environment would shift from a state that allows diatoms to compete effectively with other algal classes to an alternate state that selectively favors dinoflagellates the internal n p ratio of dinoflagellates is generally higher than that of diatoms klausmeier et al 2004 and a high n p ratio is thus more likely to promote dinoflagellates additionally warming has been implicated in the intensification of multiple habs in several mid and higher latitude regions where current temperatures lie below those supporting maximal algal growth griffith et al 2019 hinder et al 2012 a time series compilation of observation based hab events since the 1980s indicated that climate change would lead to an increase in annual hab events in the ecs from their 1985 2013 historical frequency by more than five fold by the end of the 21st century zhou et al 2021 statistical prediction based on conservative forecasting of environmental changes suggested that dinoflagellate blooms would be more frequent and intense in response to the warming in the ecs xiao et al 2018 according to the simulations conducted in the present study however dinoflagellate blooms would occur earlier but their magnitude would be reduced against the background of progressive warming in coastal waters adjacent to the ce this could be due to the higher optimal temperature but narrower temperature window for the growth of dinoflagellates compared to diatoms suzuki and takahashi 1995 some dinoflagellates would adapt genetically to higher temperature shen et al 2016 suggested that the rubisco gene expression of karenia mikimotoi which is critical to photosynthesis increased when temperature rose from 16 to 24 c and decreased with the increase of temperature from 24 to 28 c similarly brosnahan et al 2020 demonstrated that warming may allow shallow inshore habitats to retain resting cysts of alexandrium catenella longer than deep offshore ones and promote habs that are more localized and are initiated earlier each year in coastal waters it is worthy of discussion whether the ocean warming regulates the phytoplankton community during the early outbreaks of dinoflagellate blooms large scale dinoflagellate blooms pose a severe threat to the mariculture industry marine ecosystems and even public health anderson et al 2012 a massive bloom of karenia mikimotoi caused mass mortalities of farmed abalone in the coastal ce area in 2012 and unprecedented economic losses exceeding 290 m usd state ocean administration 2012 in anticipation of growing hab problems research on potential mitigation strategies should be prioritized strategies based on physical chemical and biological manipulations such as ultrasonic treatment park et al 2017 microorganisms based methods sun et al 2018 and plant derived allelochemicals zhu et al 2021 showed promise on habs control habs increased disproportionately with eutrophication however were depending largely on which nutrients change and in what proportion glibert 2017 thus nutrient input reduction is a key underling approach should be considered in almost all instances according to the simulations conducted in this study without changes in nutrient concentrations the shrinkage of the cdw moderate warming or an increase in light intensity did not drive the evolution of habs reducing the discharge of three species of macronutrients decelerates the increase in bloom magnitude but has no significant influence on the ratio of diatoms to dinoflagellates therefore indiscriminate nutrient input reduction is inadequate to reduce the dominance of dinoflagellates during spring blooms previous studies suggested that nitrate was the key factor controlling the intensity of dinoflagellate blooms and phosphate and silicate limitation played a dominant role in the succession from diatoms to dinoflagellates during the spring bloom zhou et al 2017a b the disproportionate and persistent input of nutrients to the ecs over the past four decades as mentioned above has transformed the area from being nitrate deficient to being phosphate deficient moon et al 2021 futhermore paralleling the increasing n input and diatom consumption silicate and phosphate will likely be the limiting factors sometime in the future wang et al 2021 reducing nitrate inputs and simultaneously increasing the discharge of silicate could reverse the trend in the evolution of blooms in this region therefore regulation of nutrient inputs would provide a potential way for hab prevention in the coastal area adjacent to ce and similar coastal areas 5 conclusions an ecological model that takes microalgae competition into consideration was developed to investigate the long term evolution from diatom blooms to dinoflagellate blooms in the coastal area adjacent to the ce based on the observationas of cdw inputs sea surface temperature and light intensity in the study area the model reproduced the temporal dynamics of microalgal blooms and three inorganic nutrient species in the year 2005 and 2011 predictions indicated that large scale dinoflagellate blooms may continue to disturb the study area over the next 30 years if the environment continues to change as usual under the assumption of global warming intensified dinoflagellate blooms would occur earlier and attain higher biomass levels reduction of the nutrient input could be a feasible management strategy to prevent the further intensification of dinoflagellate blooms and such efforts should be focused on adjustment of the nutrient composition reducing the riverine nitrogen inputs maintaining or even simultaneously increasing silicate inputs would provide an effective strategy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15780,harmful algal blooms habs worldwide are experiencing obvious changes under the combined impacts of global warming eutrophication and other driving forces in the east china sea ecs large scale blooms caused by dinoflagellates occurred since 2000 and there has been an apparent shift of bloom causative microalgae from diatoms to dinoflagellates to predict the future evolution of habs in this region a model was developed based on the competition between diatoms and dinoflagellates which would serve to reproduce the seasonal succession of microalgal blooms driven by multiple environmental factors the evolution features of habs were then projected under different scenarios of eutrophication and global warming under the business as usual scenario dinoflagellate blooms are expected to become more frequent with higher peak biomass concentrations over the next 30 years changes in nutrient composition of the changjiang riverine discharge may largely give rise to this phenomenon and accelerated warming associated with climate change may result in earlier occurrence of dinoflagellate blooms to prevent further intensification of dinoflagellate blooms efforts could be made to reduce nitrogen inputs and maintain or even increase silicate inputs from the changjiang river graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords harmful algal bloom warming eutrophication east china sea prediction ecological modelling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction apparent changes of harmful algal blooms habs such as those in their distribution frequency geographic scale and causative agent have been demonstrated worldwide anderson et al 2002 hallegraeff et al 2021 considerable efforts have been expended into defining potential responses of habs to global change especially global warming and nutrients glibert 2020 wells et al 2015 for instance using high resolution sea surface temperature records and temperature dependent growth rates of two algal species gobler et al 2017 indicated that increasing ocean temperature could be an important factor facilitating the intensification of habs in north america based on 50 year 1960 2009 time series data of diatoms and dinoflagellates in the northeast atlantic and north sea hinder et al 2012 found a marked increase in the relative abundance of diatoms vs dinoflagellates driven by the effects of both increasing sea surface temperature and increasing wind stress conditions in summer in parallel anthropogenic nutrient over enrichment has driven significant changes in nutrient concentrations and composition which have altered the occurrence of habs coupled with rising temperature eutrophication has driven an increase in hab incidence in the freshwater to marine continuum paerl et al 2018 glibert 2020 suggested that concurrent climate and nutrient changes were likely to favor mixotrophic microalgae over diatoms therefore previous studies underscore the need for more in depth consideration of hab responses to nutrient pollution and global warming with increasing understanding of the mechanisms underlying habs greater effort has been directed to studies of hab prediction some changes including the expansion of warm water species species specific changes in the abundance and seasonal growth window of hab taxa earlier peak production of some phytoplankters and poleward migration of habs were expected gobler et al 2017 griffith et al 2019 hallegraeff 2010 due to lack of reliable methods and a surprising scarcity of data prediction of habs in response to global change however is still fraught with uncertainties gobler 2020 wells et al 2020 additionally the consequences of environmental changes are synergistic but the complex interactions among environmental factors were rarely considered in climate simulation scenarios for the lack of real time data ralston and moore 2020 wells et al 2015 there is one key certainty habs will continue to occur in an anthropogenically altered ocean and the final outcomes of changing trends in habs remain poorly understood in temperate waters bloom succession from diatoms to various flagellate species from spring to early summer is a common phenomenon sommer et al 2012 diatom dinoflagellate ratio which reflects the dominance of diatoms or dinoflagellates during the phytoplankton spring bloom was suggested as a core indicator on the marine strategy framework directive msfd helcom 2016 in the east china sea ecs coastal waters adjacent to the changjiang river estuary ce have undergone exacerbated habs and an apparent shift of major bloom forming species from diatoms to dinoflagellates occurred around the year 2000 zhou et al 2008 extensive field observations have been conducted in this region which provided not only a sufficient database for long term studies but also a baseline against which future changes can be assessed based on historical observations marked changes in eutrophication and warming contributed to the dramatic increase in microalgal biomass with a decreasing diatom dinoflagellate ratio particularly in spring jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 besides previous works revealed that seasonal variations in environmental conditions altered the succession of dominant microalgae and promoted the growth of dinoflagellates in the ecs zhou et al 2017a b further assumption was made in this study that the selection of seasonal fluctuations over several decades is responsible for the increasing dominance of dinoflagellate blooms in the past decades in accord with this logic the evolution of habs could be projected based on analyses of competitions between the two types of microalgal blooms under different scenarios of eutrophication and warming in this study a zero dimensional numerical model was established to focus on the temporal succession of two dominant microalgal taxa in coastal ecs waters based on the model the succession processes of spring blooms were simulated in two typical years and a global sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate how the variations in model outputs can be attributed to variations in the different environmental factors furthermore a set of scenario analyses were conducted to explore the evolving trend of habs in the near future under the ongoing regional trend of increasing eutrophication and ocean warming results will offer a relevant and useful case study to improve current understanding of the evolving trend in algal bloom development and composition as well as support the development of prevention strategies for large scale dinoflagellate blooms which may also applicable to other temperate waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area coastal waters adjacent to the ce is located in the center of the chinese eastern coast fig 1 a freshwater runoff from the changjiang river coastal currents along mainland china ecs coastal current and yellow sea coast current the taiwan warm current twc from the taiwan strait and a near shore branch of the kuroshio current nkbc extending from northeast taiwan affect this area jiang et al 2014 lv et al 2006 zhou et al 2008 according to the monitoring data from 1933 to 2017 ecs environmental monitoring a significant change in the frequency of habs occurred around 2000 in the study area fig 1c 2 2 data sources and processing in situ environmental data including temperature nutrient and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations in the coastal area adjacent to the ce were sourced from field cruises conducted in 2002 2005 2010 2016 and 2018 the cruises were organized along nine transects and at 49 independent stations from march to june fig 1b water samples were collected at different depths with niskin bottles phytoplankton cells for determination of chl a were filtered onto glass fiber whatman gf f filters 25 mm diameter nominal pore size 0 68 Âµm and chl a was extracted with 90 acetone and determined with a fluorescence method water samples for nutrient analysis were filtered through glass fiber filters and determined colorimetrically temperature was measured with a conductivity temperature depth recorder sbe37 ctd monthly averaged solar radiation data were obtained from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep 27 6 on 29 5 n 121 87 oe 123 75 e additionally buoy datasets of sea water temperature and chl a determined from sept 2009 to nov 2016 were used to fill missing values of the field dataset the positions of two buoys were marked by triangles in fig 1b the characteristics of stratification and water masses during diatom and dinoflagellate blooms were analyzed based on field observation which indicated that both types of microalgal blooms occurred in the coastal region above the pycnocline at a depth of 20 m zhou et al 2019 therefore the high risk region of diatom and dinoflagellate blooms was assumed as homogeneous box in this study daily averaged values of nutrients and chl a in 2005 and 2011 were calculated to assess the model s ability to capture the seasonal succession characteristics of habs the monthly averaged values of the environmental variables were calculated and shown as green circles in fig 2 historical data of nutrient concentrations sea water temperature and solar radiation in waters adjacent to the ce nutrient concentrations of the changjiang riverine discharge were obtained from the published record duan et al 2008 ge et al 2020 jiang et al 2014 li et al 2014 2012 2007 sun et al 2009 wang 2006 wang et al 2021 ye et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 monthly variation of changjiang river runoff at the datong station was sourced from the changjiang water resources commission ministry of water resources http www cjw gov cn relative to the riverine discharge changes in nutrient inputs from atmospheric deposition over the past 30 years were reported as negligible zhao and wang 2007 similarly the intrusion of the nkbc was reported to have an 8 year periodicity in strength but no obvious long term trend wang and oey 2014 based on the historical data shown as gray circles in fig 2 polynomial fitting was performed to obtain the evolution trend of environmental conditions which provided the basis for predictions shown as red solid lines in fig 2 2 3 model development a numerical model as an extension of a zero dimensional model established by zhou et al 2017b was developed to simulate the temporal dynamics of the diatom and dinoflagellate blooms this model contains nine state variables five nutrients dissolved organic nitrogen don dissolved organic phosphate dop dissolved inorganic nitrogen din mainly nitrate dissolved inorganic phosphate dip mainly phosphate dissolved silicate disi mainly silicate two phytoplankton functional groups biomass of diatoms and dinoflagellates is expressed as chl a and detritus detritus nitrogen dptn and detritus silicate dptsi the ecological processes include photosynthesis respiration exudation and mortality of diatoms and dinoflagellates mineralization of dissolved organic nutrients decomposition and dissolution of detritus the equations corresponding to these processes are introduced in appendix a and a model schematic is shown in fig 3 the numerical model was implemented with matlab and included 224 programming statements and 35 parameters as listed in appendix b most of the parameters are based on the values given in zhou et al 2017b with some additions based on previous experimental results mutshinda et al 2013 suzuki and takahashi 1995 xu et al 2010 in situ data of chl a temperature light intensity and three species of inorganic nutrients were used to optimize model performance changes of state variables chl a nitrate phosphate and silicate were calculated by inputting time series data of the independent variables temperature light intensity and nutrient source input temperature and light intensity data were the results of consecutive linear interpolation initial chl a concentrations for diatoms and dinoflagellates were set at 0 7 and 0 3 g l 1 respectively initial values of nitrate phosphate silicate don and dop were set as the average values of field observations this model uses three nutrient source as inputs including the changjiang discharge atmospheric deposition and the intrusion of open sea water evolution of the nutrient load in the ce from 2004 to 2016 was examined against field data which indicated that the changjiang discharge showed relatively stable seasonal variation and was the dominant force driving nutrient dynamics wang et al 2020 in this study the specific values of the riverine nutrient concentration daily flux and sampling volume were considered to calculate the net nutrient input from the changjiang discharge the nutrient input in may was set as 40 of the total value to reflect the normalized diversion of cdw lie et al 2003 atmospheric deposition is an important contributor to changjiang riverine nutrients but only in summer chen et al 2019 the nutrient input from atmospheric deposition was therefore set as a fixed value and its seasonal changes were partly derived from the input flux of riverine nutrients the nkbc conveys the phosphate from the deep sea to bottom water off the coast of zhejiang and upwelling further delivers phosphate to surface water yang et al 2013 the supplement of nutrients from the open sea water was calculated according to the velocity and distribution of upwelling and the nutrient concentration in bottom water to evaluate model performance simulated values of chl a and nutrient were compared with field data in 2005 and 2011 the coefficient of determination r2 and the slope of the corresponding linear fit were calculated as most of the model parameters were based on previous study zhou et al 2017b the model outputs such as the variations in diatom and dinoflagellate biomass were mainly controlled by the input environmental factors in order to quantify the amount of variance that each environmental factors contributes to the unconditional variance of the model output sobol sensitivity analysis was performed with matlab pianosi et al 2016 sobol 1990 2 4 model simulation experiments ten model simulation experiments were designed to predict the trend in the evolution of habs in the next 30 years and try to identify quantitative prevention strategies for large scale dinoflagellate blooms for each of the separate experiments the model was re initialized for the first day by imposing the adjusted conditions described in table 1 the model was then run forward from 1950 until the end of 2050 changes beyond the year 2050 were not projected because it is unclear whether phytoplankton will adapt to future niches over time irwin et al 2015 indicated by the daily average and maximum chl a concentration during the entire spring bloom from march to july the relative abundance of diatoms and dinoflagellates were compared to illustrate the experimental results for each case in scenario 1 prediction of long term changes in the spring bloom was performed based on linear fitted values of the riverine nutrient input the local nutrient concentration temperature and light intensity in the coastal area adjacent to the ce multispatial convergent cross mapping multispatial ccm was performed based on the simulated results in scenario 1 to evaluate non linear interactions between diatoms and dinoflagellates clark et al 2015 scenarios 2 and 3 were designed to forecast the evolution of habs in the coastal area adjacent to the ce under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 tan et al 2018 additionally scenario 4 was designed to simulate the evolution of habs under extreme warming acceleration with a long term temperature rise rate of about 1 c per decade belkin 2009 belkin and lee 2014 tang et al 2009 scenarios 5 to 10 were designed to formulate a nutrient regulation strategy to prevent large scale dinoflagellate blooms 3 results 3 1 model performance the simulated seasonal variations of chl a nitrate phosphate and silicate are shown in fig 4 the succession from diatoms to dinoflagellates during the spring bloom in 2005 fig 4a and 2011 fig 4b was reproduced with two peaks of chl a variations of nitrate phosphate and silicate concentrations were also reproduced and were generally identical with observations except for nitrate the simulated concentrations of phosphate and silicate were lower than the observations as no field data of organic forms of nitrogen n and phosphorus p were available the mechanism of nutrient supplementation invoked in this model was hypothetically simplified and this may give rise to the relatively lower simulation results obtained additionally to evaluate the effects of inorganic nutrient supply on the underlying succession processes of the spring bloom the utilization of organic forms of n and p by dinoflagellates was represented by increasing the nutrient limiting tolerance of dinoflagellates such that a small change in inorganic nutrients could result in a large change in dinoflagellate biomass thus there was a more pronounced reduction in dinoflagellates than diatoms when the inorganic nutrients were low in addition it is a limitation that the simulation did not evaluate the spatial dependencies in environmental conditions or their roles on the spatial variability in habs as the high risk region of habs was treated as a homogeneous box in this study the basic outcome of the sobol sensitivity analysis including the normalized first order and total sensitivity index for the input environmental factors were shown in fig 5 phosphate concentration in the ecs ecs dip was the most sensitive input factor for the growth of diatoms as it had the highest first and total order index for the daily averaged and maximum values of diatom biomass nitrate concentration in the ecs was the most sensitive input factor for the growth of dinoflagellate for the daily averaged values of dinoflagellate biomass the differences between the first and total indices of ecs dip indicated obvious interactions between ecs dip and the other input factors the computation of the second order sensitivity indices had been performed for all the input factors and they were each evaluated for combinations with the other factors shown as pattern plots in appendix c besides ecs dip the concentration of silicate in the ecs the concentration of nutrients and the flux of changjiang yangtze river temperature and light intensity had second order sensitivity indices to the simulated maximum values of dinoflagellate biomass which indicated noticeable indirect roles of these factors 3 2 analysis of different scenarios changes of the spring bloom since 1950 were reproduced in scenario 1 and the changing trend supported the hypothesis that dinoflagellate blooms would become the dominant type of bloom in the study area figs 6 a and b the magnitude of the dinoflagellate bloom became larger than that of diatoms after 2000 which suggested that the year 2000 was a critical juncture for the evolution from a diatom dominated to a dinoflagellate dominated phase results of maltispatial ccm shown in appendix d suggested that the interactions between diatoms and dinoflagellates increased from 1950s pearson correlation coefficient Ï goes to 0 4 during the period from 1950 to 1975 to 2000s Ï goes to 0 9 during the period from 2000 to 2020 and kept high until 2050s Ï goes to 0 8 during the period from 2025 to 2050 simulation results of daily averaged chl a concentrations indicated that the ratio of diatoms to dinoflagellates varied continuously in parallel with changes in environmental conditions and the advantage of dinoflagellates became more pronounced in the following 30 years therefore if the intrusion flux and nutrient concentration of changjiang diluted water cdw continued to change following the previous trend dinoflagellates would be expected to increasingly dominate the spring bloom leading to the consequent aggravation of dinoflagellate blooms with the impacts of accelerated warming combined with eutrophication the dinoflagellate bloom would appear earlier and attain a higher biomass in scenarios 2 3 and 4 the increase in peak dinoflagellate abundance was accelerated but daily averaged biomass values were clearly reduced when temperature increased under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 and at rate of 1 c per decade figs 6c d and e reduction of the nutrient input is a feasible management strategy to prevent large scale dinoflagellate blooms especially the efforts focusing on the adjustment of the nutrient composition when the concentration of all nutrient species remained unchanged at 2020 levels the increase in temperature and light intensity and the decrease in the cdw water flux did not result in notable variation in the blooms of diatoms or dinoflagellates fig 6f in turn when nutrient concentrations decreased to half of 2020 levels through 2050 the phytoplankton biomass obviously decreased fig 6g relative to the decrease in diatoms changes in dinoflagellates were negligible in scenario 7 when the nitrate concentrations in the cdw and ecs were set at 2020 levels and the other conditions continued to change following the previous trend the magnitude of the decrease in diatoms and increase in dinoflagellates became more pronounced and the advantage of dinoflagellates continued to increase fig 6h in scenario 8 when the nitrate concentration decreased over time until it reached one half of 2020 levels by 2050 the phytoplankton biomass exhibited a decreasing trend and the reduction in diatoms was more apparent fig 6i in scenario 9 when the nitrate concentration decreased to half of 2020 levels by 2050 and the silicate was set at 2020 levels the decrease in dinoflagellates was more obvious than that of diatoms fig 6j finally in scenario 10 when the nitrate concentration decreased to half of 2020 levels and the silicate concentration increased by a factor of two by 2050 the biomass of diatoms increased and was paralleled by an obvious reduction in that of dinoflagellates such that the former eventually exceeded the later fig 6k 4 discussion characterized by high industrialization and urbanization the coastal area adjacent to the ce is facing progressive eutrophication the changjiang river is the major pathway of nutrient input from this area to the ecs liu et al 2018 its n and p load has increased ca seven to eightfold since the 1960s chen et al 2012 but the silicate concentration decreased gradually after impoundment of the three gorges dam tgd wang et al 2021 accordingly the n p ratio has been steadily increasing and the si n ratio has been decreasing in the coastal area adjacent to the ce jiang et al 2014 moon et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 in the near future nutrient related signs of eutrophication could continue to worsen in coastal waters adjacent to the ce if the nitrate concentration of the cdw increases at the same rate as in past decades the predicted nitrate load in 2050 would be twice that in 2000 whereas the silicate concentration is expected to continue to decrease this would cause a further increase of the n p ratio and decrease of the si n ratio in the region temperature effects of phytoplankton growth and composition are more important in shallow coastal waters which experience larger temperature fluctuations than oceanic waters according to the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar5 the global surface temperature change for the end of the 21st century 2081 2100 is projected to exceed 1 5 c under intermediate and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 ipcc2014 the ecs as a large marine ecosystem suffers the most rapid warming at rates 2 4 times the global mean belkin 2009 the results of linear fitting based on the historical records indicated that the sst has increased by 0 76 c at 95 confidence interval in the period of 1960 2020 and it was projected to increase continuously at a rate of 0 13 c per decade furthermore according to the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 the ecs sea surface was projected to increase by 1 47 c and 2 10 c by the middle of the 21st century 2050 2060 relative to historical observations 1980 2005 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively tan et al 2018 additionally along with global warming and strengthening of transport by the twc due to enhanced kuroshio tang et al 2009 warming of the ecs was reported to be accelerating from 1982 to 2003 at a rate of up to 1 00 c per decade belkin 2009 the observational and satellite data of seawater temperature recorded from 1957 to 2001 and 1985 to 2002 respectively has confirmed this increasing trend wang et al 2013 predictions of the response of habs to eutrophication and ocean warming have been previously attempted in the ecs but most of prior studies did not differentiate the types of microalgal blooms in this study competitions between diatoms and dinoflagellates were considered in an ecological model to simulate the respective responses of these two types of common microalgal blooms under the business as usual scenario a forecasting simulation spanning the next 30 years predicted that dinoflagellate blooms will be aggravated since the n p ratio increased and si n ratio decreased in the cdw the chemical environment would shift from a state that allows diatoms to compete effectively with other algal classes to an alternate state that selectively favors dinoflagellates the internal n p ratio of dinoflagellates is generally higher than that of diatoms klausmeier et al 2004 and a high n p ratio is thus more likely to promote dinoflagellates additionally warming has been implicated in the intensification of multiple habs in several mid and higher latitude regions where current temperatures lie below those supporting maximal algal growth griffith et al 2019 hinder et al 2012 a time series compilation of observation based hab events since the 1980s indicated that climate change would lead to an increase in annual hab events in the ecs from their 1985 2013 historical frequency by more than five fold by the end of the 21st century zhou et al 2021 statistical prediction based on conservative forecasting of environmental changes suggested that dinoflagellate blooms would be more frequent and intense in response to the warming in the ecs xiao et al 2018 according to the simulations conducted in the present study however dinoflagellate blooms would occur earlier but their magnitude would be reduced against the background of progressive warming in coastal waters adjacent to the ce this could be due to the higher optimal temperature but narrower temperature window for the growth of dinoflagellates compared to diatoms suzuki and takahashi 1995 some dinoflagellates would adapt genetically to higher temperature shen et al 2016 suggested that the rubisco gene expression of karenia mikimotoi which is critical to photosynthesis increased when temperature rose from 16 to 24 c and decreased with the increase of temperature from 24 to 28 c similarly brosnahan et al 2020 demonstrated that warming may allow shallow inshore habitats to retain resting cysts of alexandrium catenella longer than deep offshore ones and promote habs that are more localized and are initiated earlier each year in coastal waters it is worthy of discussion whether the ocean warming regulates the phytoplankton community during the early outbreaks of dinoflagellate blooms large scale dinoflagellate blooms pose a severe threat to the mariculture industry marine ecosystems and even public health anderson et al 2012 a massive bloom of karenia mikimotoi caused mass mortalities of farmed abalone in the coastal ce area in 2012 and unprecedented economic losses exceeding 290 m usd state ocean administration 2012 in anticipation of growing hab problems research on potential mitigation strategies should be prioritized strategies based on physical chemical and biological manipulations such as ultrasonic treatment park et al 2017 microorganisms based methods sun et al 2018 and plant derived allelochemicals zhu et al 2021 showed promise on habs control habs increased disproportionately with eutrophication however were depending largely on which nutrients change and in what proportion glibert 2017 thus nutrient input reduction is a key underling approach should be considered in almost all instances according to the simulations conducted in this study without changes in nutrient concentrations the shrinkage of the cdw moderate warming or an increase in light intensity did not drive the evolution of habs reducing the discharge of three species of macronutrients decelerates the increase in bloom magnitude but has no significant influence on the ratio of diatoms to dinoflagellates therefore indiscriminate nutrient input reduction is inadequate to reduce the dominance of dinoflagellates during spring blooms previous studies suggested that nitrate was the key factor controlling the intensity of dinoflagellate blooms and phosphate and silicate limitation played a dominant role in the succession from diatoms to dinoflagellates during the spring bloom zhou et al 2017a b the disproportionate and persistent input of nutrients to the ecs over the past four decades as mentioned above has transformed the area from being nitrate deficient to being phosphate deficient moon et al 2021 futhermore paralleling the increasing n input and diatom consumption silicate and phosphate will likely be the limiting factors sometime in the future wang et al 2021 reducing nitrate inputs and simultaneously increasing the discharge of silicate could reverse the trend in the evolution of blooms in this region therefore regulation of nutrient inputs would provide a potential way for hab prevention in the coastal area adjacent to ce and similar coastal areas 5 conclusions an ecological model that takes microalgae competition into consideration was developed to investigate the long term evolution from diatom blooms to dinoflagellate blooms in the coastal area adjacent to the ce based on the observationas of cdw inputs sea surface temperature and light intensity in the study area the model reproduced the temporal dynamics of microalgal blooms and three inorganic nutrient species in the year 2005 and 2011 predictions indicated that large scale dinoflagellate blooms may continue to disturb the study area over the next 30 years if the environment continues to change as usual under the assumption of global warming intensified dinoflagellate blooms would occur earlier and attain higher biomass levels reduction of the nutrient input could be a feasible management strategy to prevent the further intensification of dinoflagellate blooms and such efforts should be focused on adjustment of the nutrient composition reducing the riverine nitrogen inputs maintaining or even simultaneously increasing silicate inputs would provide an effective strategy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15781,water treatment with nanofiltration nf or reverse osmosis ro membranes results in a purified permeate and a retentate where solutes are concentrated and have to be properly managed and discharged to date little is known on how the selection of a semi permeable dense membrane impacts the dissolved organic matter in the concentrate and what the consequences are for micropollutant mp abatement and bromate formation during concentrate treatment with ozone laboratory ozonation experiments were performed with standardized concentrates produced by three membranes two nfs and one low pressure reverse osmosis lpro membrane from three water sources two river waters and one lake water the concentrates were standardized by adjustment of ph and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon total inorganic carbon selected micropollutants mp with a low to high ozone reactivity and bromide to exclude factors which are known to impact ozonation nf membranes had a lower retention of bromide and mps than the lpro membrane and if the permeate quality of the nf membrane meets the requirements the selection of this membrane type is beneficial due to the lower bromate formation risks upon concentrate ozonation the bromate formation was typically higher in standardized concentrates of lpro than of nf membranes but the tradeoff between mp abatement and bromate formation upon ozonation of the standardized concentrates was not affected by the membrane type furthermore there was no difference for the different source waters overall ozonation of concentrates is only feasible for abatement of mps with a high to moderate ozone reactivity with limited bromate formation differences in the dom composition between nf and lpro membrane concentrates are less relevant than

tradeoff between the desired mp abatement and the undesired formation of bromate strategies for bromate mitigation during ozone treatment are known and include e g the addition of h2o2 von gunten 2003 h2o2 addition results in the fast transformation of o3 to oh which may reduce bromate formation due to a partial shutdown of a combined oh o3 pathway merle et al 2017 von gunten and hoignÃ© 1994 von

moieties are rejected by ro but not by nf and these could possibly influence e g the ozone chemistry and the ensuing o3 and oh exposures this study investigates the ozone treatment of concentrates from different nf and lpro membranes that were applied to reject mps in different surface water sources specifically this study aims to investigate how hypothetically differing dom compositions in nf and ro concentrates impact the abatement of mps the formation of bromate and the tradeoff between mp abatement and bromate formation upon ozone treatment two river water rapid sand filtrates waters

in table 1 the retentions by the membranes of br and mps present in rr without spiking were determined in bench scale experiments with flat sheet membranes figure s1 si the cross flow test unit triple system mms membrane systems switzerland was operated batch wise for each membrane with a 2 l rr grab sample at a transmembrane pressure of 5 bar and a controlled water temperature of 25 c after filling the feed tank with the water sample the operational set point was adjusted and the unit was left to stabilize for at least 1 hour recycling the permeate back to the feed tank then an initial

bottle during this time the permeate was discarded into a separate permeate tank so that the feed water was not altered by dilution with permeate the concentrates were standardized before ozone treatment to guarantee good comparability the standardization protocol is described in text s1 si in brief the concentrates were adjusted to the same ph 8 3 0 1 and concentrations of doc tic selected mps table 2 bromide and borate buffer 10 mm mps were selected to represent a broad range of second order rate constants table s4 si provides water quality parameters before ozonation of the different

von sonntag and von gunten 2012 westerhoff et al 2007 hence the estimated s of the standardized concentrates was on average 1 7 105 s 1 range 0 8 to 2 3 105 s 1 the oh scavenging rate by the spiked mps never exceeded 0 2 105 s 1 and was typically 10 of s therefore the spiked mps did not significantly interfere with the ozonation conditions and the results can be transferred to real i e non spiked samples the standardized concentrates were ozonated at different specific ozone doses to investigate the abatement of mps and formation of bro3 details on the experimental standard protocol are provided in text s2 si in brief aliquots of the standardized concentrates were filled in glass vials subsequently ozone was added from an ozone stock solution with a known ozone concentration analytical methods the analytical methods are described in detail in text s3 si together with the limits of quantification methods accuracies and the measurement ranges in brief the electron donating capacity edc was measured according to a modified standard protocol walpen et al 2020 by adding the radical cation of 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts to dilution series of each concentrate buffered at ph 8 3 with 10 mm borate and subsequent measurement of the absorbance at 728 nm after 15 min reaction time dom was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography sec coupled with an organic carbon detector ocd and an ultraviolet detector uvd at 254 nm model 8b doc labor dr huber germany micropollutants were measured by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography uhplc coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ms ms bromide and bromate were separated by ion chromatography ic and measured by an inductively coupled plasma icp coupled with ms ms results and discussion membrane performance the relative retentions of doc br and mps in bench scale experiments with flat sheet membranes are provided in table 3 note that for the lpro membrane retentions of several mps were reported before with the same feed water rr raw water at a somewhat higher transmembrane pressure i e at 7 bar roth et al 2021 while the doc retentions were similar for all membranes the membrane types strongly differ in their retentions of bromide and mps this means that the doc is more efficiently concentrated in nf concentrates than br in contrast in lpro concentrates doc and br are concentrated to the same extent in turn this should make the nf concentrates more feasible than the lpro concentrate for ozonation at similar specific ozone doses because the relatively lower br concentrations mean a lower bromate formation potential nevertheless the membrane selection is typically determined by the permeate quality requirements with respect to the target mp concentrations in the permeate to this end lpro membranes produce a permeate with a higher quality bromide is not regulated in the drinking water because br itself is not relevant for human health hence higher br concentrations in the nf permeate than in the lpro concentrate are acceptable unless the permeate is treated e g with chlorine based processes e g for disinfection in this case higher br concentrations are associated with an increased risk for the formation of bromine containing disinfection byproducts dbps which are generally more toxic than the chlorine analogues heeb et al 2014 regli et al 2015 wagner and plewa 2017 however the risk for dbp formation is lower in the nf permeate compared to the nf feed due to the lower dom concentrations as dom is the main precursor of dbps sharma et al 2014 characterization of standardized concentrates the edc was measured as a parameter determining the phenol content of dom which is mostly responsible for the initial ozone demand aeschbacher et al 2010 houska et al 2021 a high edc indicates a high concentration of o3 reactive moieties walpen et al 2020 which for a given specific ozone dose might result in a lower o3 exposure results of edc measurements of the non standardized concentrates are shown in table 4 the absolute edcs of standardized concentrates shown in the second rows of each cell in table 4 varied within a factor of 2 2 and depended on the water source i e the same order was observed for all investigated membranes rw rr lb sec ocd or sec uvd chromatograms were not useful to detect differences between the standardized concentrates data not shown minor differences were observed with respect to the water sources which is explained by their different catchment areas the membrane selection did not impact the sec chromatograms the specific uv absorbances at 254 nm suva254 of the standardized concentrates were similar within the standard uncertainty 0 7 l mgc 1 m 1 estimated by the gaussian error propagation rule table s4 si treatment of standardized concentrates data of all mp abatements and molar bromate yields are provided in the dataset csv file si and discussed below abatement of micropollutants the results for the abatement of mps during ozonation are shown in figure s3 si the abatement of mps follows the order atz ibu bzf bta ato cbz dcf this agrees with the order expected from the second order rate constants for reactions of the mps with o3 and oh table 2 in the following mps with a high ozone reactivity are discussed which are almost exclusively abated by reactions with o3 group i i e cbz and dcf then o3 resistant mps are discussed because their abatement can be mostly explained by reactions with oh groups iii and iv i e ibu and atz respectively finally mps with a moderate ozone reactivity are discussed where both reactions with o3 and oh are important for their abatement group ii i e ato bta and bzf micropollutants with high ozone reactivity mps with high ozone reactivity such as cbz or dcf table 2 are abated to high extents even at relatively low specific o3 doses typically these compounds are abated predominantly by direct reactions with o3 lee and von gunten 2016 at about 0 2 mg o3 mg doc 1 cbz fig 1 a and dcf figure s4a si were abated by 67 to 86 and 74 to 90 respectively in different standardized concentrates with different raw waters fig 1b and c show the differences of the relative cbz abatements of lb and rr compared to rw respectively for specific ozone doses of 0 2 and 0 3 mg o3 mg doc 1 all differences between lb or rr and rw were significantly 0 p 0 05 which means a lower cbz abatement in rw compared to the other water resources the lower differences of about 5 between rw and the other water sources at a specific ozone dose of 0 3 mg o3 mg doc 1 can be explained by the already very high relative abatements of cbz close to 100 no statistically significant differences were observed comparing cbz abatements of rr and lb similar results were obtained for dcf at 0 2 mg o3 mg doc 1 figure s4b si at 0 3 mg o3 mg doc 1 dcf was already abated to residual concentrations below the limit of quantification figure s4 si for both mps the membrane type did not have a statistically significant impact on their abetment in standardized concentrates based on the edc values table 4 for a given specific ozone dose the ozone exposures were expected to follow the order rw rr lb therefore a lower abatement efficiency for cbz and dcf abatements in rw than in rr or lb can be expected which is consistent with the obtained results in fig 1 and s4 si this highlights that the ozone exposure was rather impacted by the water source and not by the membrane type ozone resistant micropollutants atz and ibu are almost exclusively abated by reactions with oh table 2 it is known that the oh exposure can be calculated from the abatement of an ozone resistant probe compound acero et al 2000 huber et al 2003 hÃ¼bner et al 2013 lee et al 2013 zucker et al 2016 according to eq 4 4 ln c mp c mp 0 k oh mp c oh dt k o 3 mp c o 3 dt 0 c mp 0 and c mp are the concentrations of a mp before and after ozonation respectively c oh and c o 3 are the time dependent concentrations of oh and o3 during ozonation respectively ibu was used as a reference compound to assess the oh exposure of the standardized concentrates no statistically significant differences were found that indicated an impact of the membrane type or water source on the oh exposure with small and similar contributions of reactions with ozone table 2 the ratio of k oh ibu k oh atz 3 0 0 6 standard deviation calculated by gaussian error propagation rule determines the expected ratio of ln abatements of these two mps black dashed line in figure s5 si however the average ratio of the observed second order rate constants was 1 4 i e about half the expected ratio regardless of the water source or the membrane used no analytical issues were observed for any of the mps discussed here i e linearity of the calibrations was acceptable throughout all measurements r2 0 995 for all mps and matrix effects could be excluded from measurements of the mp recovery after spiking both in ozonated and non ozonated concentrates the abatement of ibu was consistent with other mps discussed below hence atz was likely abated faster than expected for unknown reasons further kinetic studies involving competition kinetics between atz and ibu are required to elucidate the reasons of this observation therefore in the following the discussions are based on ibu micropollutants with moderate ozone reactivity three mps with moderate ozone reactivities were investigated in this study i e ato bta and bzf their abatement is expected to occur both by reactions with o3 and oh plots of the negative natural logarithm of relative residual concentrations of bta and bzf are shown in fig 2 as functions of the negative natural logarithm of relative residual concentrations of ibu as oh reference compound the plots indicate that significant contributions of o3 reactions only occurred at specific ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc 1 highlighted data from experiments with rr standardized concentrates in fig 2 because below this specific ozone dose abatements of bta and bzf did not significantly exceed the abatement expected from reactions with oh based ibu as oh reference compound based on the significant second order rate constants for the reactions of bzf and bta with ozone table 2 a more pronounced difference would have been expected if the ozone exposures were significant for specific ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc 1 these observations can be explained by a fast initial consumption of o3 likely by fast reacting phenolic dom moieties houska et al 2021 Ã¶nnby et al 2018 yielding partially oh therefore contributions of reactions with o3 to the abatement of mps such as bta and bzf become more important when these dom moieties are abated chon et al 2015 formation of bromate upon ozonation bromate can be formed from bromide by a complex reaction mechanism including both o3 and oh von gunten and hoignÃ© 1994 von gunten and oliveras 1998 results for Î· upon ozonation of the standardized concentrates are presented in fig 3 for example at a specific o3 dose of about 0 4 mg o3 mg doc 1 15 2 Î¼g bro3 l 1 were formed on average range 11 to 19 Î¼g bro3 l 1 corresponding to a molar bromate yield Î· of 2 9 0 9 range 1 4 to 3 8 this bromate concentration is above the drinking water standard 10 Î¼g bro3 l 1 but below the proposed swiss environmental quality standard 50 Î¼g bro3 l 1 oekotoxzentrum 2015 soltermann et al 2016b for the same water source membrane specific differences in molar bromate yields were observed i e ozonated lpro membrane concentrates colored symbols in fig 3 typically had higher molar bromate yields than the nf membrane concentrates on average Î· of the standardized lpro membranes was 43 51 higher than for the corresponding nf membranes at specific ozone doses in the range of 0 19 to 0 51 mg o3 mg doc 1 nevertheless no statistical significance was observed except in rw at the highest specific ozone dose 0 9 mg o3 mg doc 1 between lpro and nf2 figure s6 si the observed molar bromate yields are well within the range of those reported previously for municipal wastewater ro reject streams at a specific o3 dose of 0 45 mg o3 mg doc 1 table s1 si king et al 2020 i e 3 1 1 5 range 0 8 to 4 5 similarly at a specific o3 dose of about 0 2 mg o3 mg doc 1 Î· was 1 0 0 4 range 0 5 to 1 4 which is reasonably close to Î· observed by benner et al 2008 1 2 at 0 17 mg o3 mg doc 1 and 1 8 at 0 24 mg o3 mg doc 1 table s1 si benner et al 2008 the good agreement of the results is likely fortuitous because of the differences between the standardized concentrates investigated here and the non standardized municipal wastewater concentrates investigated by king et al 2020 and benner et al 2008 tradeoff between micropollutant abatement and bromate formation fig 4 shows the molar bromate yield in the standardized concentrates as functions of the abatement of representative mps with high dcf group i and moderate bta and ato group ii ozone reactivity and mps of an ozone resistant compound ibu group iii dcf and ato were selected because they were studied before in ozonation of municipal wastewater ro concentrates and data was available for the corresponding bromate formation king et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 ibu was also compared with published results from diethyltoluamide deet even though it has somewhat lower second order rate constants for reactions with o3 k o 3 deet 0 1 m 1 s 1 benitez et al 2013 and oh k oh deet 5 109 m 1 s 1 song et al 2009 i e group iii ozonation of standardized concentrates resulted in very similar abatement trends of mps and formation of bromate for all water sources or the membrane types hence even if the water source or membrane selection impacted the o3 and oh exposures this did not result in a change of the tradeoff between mp abatement and bromate formation this finding is based on the connection of bromate formation and mp abatement by combinations of ozone and oh reactions and the corresponding exposures the results also highlight that the small differences in the dissolved organic matter composition between nf and lpro membrane concentrates are of minor relevance for the treatment efficiency and the tradeoff between mp abatement and bromate formation the data for the treatment of standardized concentrates from surface waters agree well with previously published data from non standardized municipal wastewater ro concentrates king et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 colored open symbols in fig 4 for specific ozone doses 1 0 mg o3 mg doc 1 despite the significantly different water qualities of the ozonated samples fig 4 highlights that the abatement of mps in the standardized concentrates can be divided into three sections i low specific ozone doses 0 1 mg o3 mg doc 1 are sufficient for mps with a high ozone reactivity such as dcf group i fig 4a to be abated by 50 to 60 at a given specific ozone dose molar bromate yields are low with Î· 0 2 ii moderate specific ozone doses in the range of 0 1 to 0 5 mg o3 mg doc 1 lead to an almost complete abatement of mps with a high ozone reactivity group i fig 4a and are sufficient to abate mps with a moderate ozone reactivity such as ato or bta group ii fig 4b by up to 50 to 60 in this range of specific ozone doses the molar bromate yield linearly increases with the abatement of mps and was typically 3 therefore here bromide concentrations should be 200 Î¼g l 1 in the concentrate before ozonation to limit bromate concentrations to the drinking water standard of 10 Î¼g l 1 at specific ozone doses around 0 5 mg o3 mg doc 1 i e which is typical for enhanced wastewater ozonation e g in switzerland this might limit the application of the investigated treatment chain in many cases considering the fact that municipal wastewater ro concentrates can contain bromide in concentrations in the range of 1 to 10 mg l 1 this might result in bromate concentrations around 50 to 500 Î¼g l 1 table s1 si i e in many cases even above the proposed swiss environmental quality standard 50 Î¼g bro3 l 1 oekotoxzentrum 2015 soltermann et al 2016b limiting bromate concentrations to the drinking water standard safeguards that all downstream stakeholders can produce drinking water from the river water riverbank filtrate at any time even in de facto water reuse situations e g as observed in some regions of germany karakurt et al 2019 iii specific ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc 1 are required for an almost complete abatement of mps with a moderate ozone reactivity group ii fig 4b or to abate ozone resistant mps such as ibu group iii fig 4c by 50 for these specific ozone doses bromate formation strongly increases with increasing specific ozone dose an ozonation of concentrates with such specific ozone doses will be challenging considering the high molar bromate yields overall concentrate ozonation with significant abatement of mps and limited bromate formation is only feasible for mps from groups i and ii fig 4a and b evaluation of nf and ro membrane processes in combination with concentrate ozonation ozonation of nf and lpro concentrates were compared to assess the overall performance for mp abatement and bromate formation four types of mp can be distinguished conceptually in process chains consisting of a membrane treatment with a subsequent concentrate ozonation as illustrated in fig 5 i e a b c and d and discussed in table 5 in which the types and examples of mps are described membrane treatment membrane treatment is evaluated by column treatment step 1 in table 5 and reflected by the x axis in fig 5 compounds of types a or b are well retained by the membrane treatment resulting in relatively low concentrations of these compounds in the permeate in contrast compounds of type c or d are retained to relatively low extents a low retention results in relatively high concentrations of these compounds in the permeate for this evaluation the available experimental data with rr raw water samples was used table 3 concentrate ozonation the concentrate has to be treated for mp abatement before discharge with the corresponding necessary specific o3 doses to comply with the local discharge limits for mps and bromate the abatement of the selected compounds upon ozonation of the concentrate is evaluated in table 5 column treatment step 2 this evaluation is based on experimental data for the abatement of bta dcf and ibu at specific ozone doses in the range of 0 24 to 0 61 mg o3 mg doc 1 and the corresponding molar bromate yields for a non standardized rw lpro concentrate this water source is different from membrane retention evaluation rr however based on the findings presented above it can be assumed that the mp abatement by ozonation is not significantly different for the different water sources in this study this is not always the case because o3 and oh exposures can significantly vary between real water sources due to differences e g in the specific nom s ozone reactivity oh yield and oh scavenging by the water background matrix elovitz and von gunten 1999 staehelin and hoignÃ© 1985 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the abatements of mps in the non standardized lpro concentrate were comparable with those in the standardized lpro concentrate text s4 and figure s7 si however the molar bromate yields in the non standardized lpro concentrate were only about half the yields of the standardized lpro concentrate at comparable specific o3 doses figure s8 si this is likely explained by the different ratios of br dom and br s between the standardized and non standardized concentrates and the different ph values the abatements of the ozone resistant mps iopromide ipr group iv and metformin met group v upon ozonation of the non standardized lpro concentrate were estimated based on the calculated oh exposure from the abatement of ibu as oh probe compound acero et al 2000 huber et al 2003 hÃ¼bner et al 2013 lee et al 2013 zucker et al 2016 the calculations were performed with eq 4 and the corresponding second order rate constants for the reactions with oh i

type a or c mps of groups i and ii lee et al 2013 in fig 5a good abatement during ozonation of the concentrate can be expected at specific ozone doses 0 6 mg o3 mg doc 1 in contrast compounds type b or d are hardly abated during ozonation with specific o3 doses 0 6 mg o3 mg doc 1 for an overall solution for mps the investigated treatment chain is well suited for type a compounds fig 5 such as dcf table 5 because they are well retained at the membrane and abated to high extends upon ozonation compounds of type b fig 5 such as ipr table 5 are well retained at the membrane but their abatement in ozone treatment of the concentrate is limited an additional treatment after ozonation such as activated carbon could improve the treated concentrate s quality to comply with the treatment goal ahn et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 hypothetical type c compounds fig 5 bta for nf1 in table 5 are retained to low extends by the nf1 membrane only if retained these compounds are well abated in the ozone treatment of the concentrate for lpro there are no known compounds which fulfill these criteria the worst case for the treatment chain are compounds of type d fig 5 met for nf1 in table 5 no compounds for lpro as they are hardly retained and hardly abated by ozone treatment in the concentrate in general for lpro there are only very few examples which fulfill the criteria for type d such as chloroform and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma marron et al 2019 for compounds of type c and d the selection of a denser membrane might be suitable to improve the retention of such compounds as in the case of bta and met table 5 compare columns nf1 and lpro this can turn a compound type c to type a fig 5 e g bta in table 5 and a compound type d to type b fig 5 e g met in table 5 nevertheless for met a different concentrate treatment will be necessary e g by a biological treatment scheurer et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 overall assessment of process combination along with the retention of mps and their abatement during ozonation of the concentrate the retention of br and the formation of bro3 during concentrate ozonation is important for the assessment of the whole process train an excessive formation of bromate might limit the application of the proposed process combination to compare the bromate formation risk for ozonation of nf1 and lpro concentrates the experimentally determined br retention values table 3 were used to calculate br levels in the concentrates given the retention r of a solute i at the membrane the concentration in the concentrate can be calculated according to eq 5 5 c concentrate i c feed i 1 w 1 r i 1 w c feed i and c concentrate i are the concentrations in the membrane feed and the concentrate respectively w is the water recovery which was assumed to be 85 as in the production of the non standardized concentrates bromide rejection r b r is known at w 75 for a rr sample and assumed to be the same at w 85 for a rw sample table 3 as a result the br concentrations in nf1 and lpro concentrates are 2 2 c feed b r and 6 4 c feed b r respectively since the bromate formation is roughly proportional to the bromide concentration the extent of bromate formation is about three times lower in the nf1 concentrate than in the lpro concentrate to estimate the bromate concentrations upon concentrate ozonation the resulting bromide concentration was multiplied with the experimentally determined molar bromate yields as discussed before Î· of standardized nf1 concentrates were about 40 lower than the standardized lpro concentrates but no statistically relevant differences were found for specific o3 doses 0 9 mg o3 mg doc 1 therefore non standardized nf1 concentrates were assumed to have the same Î· as the non standardized lpro concentrate which is a worst case scenario for the nf1 concentrate treatment combining this information bromate concentrations in the nf concentrate are estimated in the range of 0 4 to 3 4 c feed b r m w bro 3 m w b r and for the lpro concentrate in the range of 1 3 to 9 7 c feed b r m w bro 3 m w b r respectively depending on the investigated specific o3 dose estimated bromate concentrations after ozone treatment of nf1 or lpro concentrates at the investigated specific ozone doses are shown in figure s9 si as functions of the bromide concentration in the membrane feed to limit bromate concentrations in the treated concentrates to 10 Î¼g l 1 here c feed b r must therefore be 185 Î¼g l 1 or 65 Î¼g l 1 for the nf1 or lpro membrane respectively for concentrate treatment with 0 61 mg o3 mg doc 1 and without additional bromate mitigation strategies in contrast if br is present in the membrane feed at concentrations 1 5 mg l 1 and 480 Î¼g l 1 here specific o3 doses of 0 24 mg o3 mg doc 1 can be used in the ozone treatment of nf1 or lpro concentrates respectively to limit bromate concentrations to 10 Î¼g l 1 figure s9 si overall the permeate quality with respect to mp concentrations is determined by the selection of the membrane denser lpro membranes must be selected if only very low mp concentrations are acceptable in the permeate however this also considerably increases the risk of bromate formation to limit bromate formation during the subsequent ozonation of concentrates to an acceptable level only low to moderate specific o3 doses can be used in the ozone treatment of the concentrate and hence significant abatement can only be expected for mps with a high or moderate ozone reactivity the composition of real concentrates produced by different membranes from the same water source will differ due to varying relative rejections of compounds as described above therefore in real concentrates the ph and concentrations of dom hco3 co3 2 and br will vary as well as concentrations of mps in addition bro3 is formed in a complex pathway involving both reactions with o3 and oh therefore all water parameters affecting these oxidant exposures can ultimately result in changes of the bromate yield elovitz et al 2000 von gunten and hoignÃ© 1994 without standardization it would be difficult to compare different concentrates in terms of the trade off between mp abatement and bro3 formation standardization of the concentrates allows to eliminate the above known parameters impacting mp abatement and bromate formation and therefore allows the assessment of the impact of water source and membrane type on the ozone treatment of the concentrate however the transferability of the obtained results to real concentrates has limitations nevertheless a reasonable agreement with real concentrates was found fig 4 one main finding of this study is that the selection of a nf membrane minimizes the risk of bromate formation during ozonation of concentrates due to the lower relative bromide retention by the membrane compared to a lpro membrane this conclusion is valid despite all limitations on transferability as the bromate yield is roughly proportional to the bromide concentration elovitz et al 2000 soltermann et al 2016a von gunten and hoignÃ© 1994 conclusion concentrates of the rivers rhine rr and wiese rw and of lake biel lb waters were obtained from a low pressure reverse osmosis lpro membrane and two nanofiltration nf membranes after standardization of the concentrates at ph 8 3 0 1 and the same concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc total inorganic carbon tic bromide br and spiked micropollutants mps the impact of the membrane selection and raw water type upon ozonation was investigated the following conclusions can be drawn it was demonstrated that the water source was the main factor impacting the electron donating capacity edc the expected lower ozone exposures for higher edcs are consistent with the lower abatement of

diclofenac ibuprofen were abated to different extents in agreement with their second order rate constants for the reactions with o3 and oh the tradeoff between the desired mp abatement and undesired bromate formation was neither impacted by the water source nor by the membrane type ozonation of concentrates at limited bromate formation was only feasible for mps with a high or moderate ozone reactivity an assessment of the mp abatement and bromate formed upon ozonation for non standardized concentrates highlighted the interplay of the membrane and the subsequent concentrate treatment the lpro membrane had a higher retention of mps and bromide than the investigated nf membranes nevertheless for lower mp retention requirements nf membranes might be a better choice because their concentrates will lead to lower bromate concentrations upon ozonation the elevated bromide concentrations in nf permeates are considered not to be an issue unless chlorine based treatments are used e g for permeate disinfection however the risk of brominated disinfection byproducts formation is lower in the nf permeate compared to the nf feed due to the rejection of dissolved organic matter in nf treatment the main precursor of such compounds in addition the lower dom concentrations typically allow to apply a lower chlorine dose which additionally reduces the risk of dbp formation declaration

15781,water treatment with nanofiltration nf or reverse osmosis ro membranes results in a purified permeate and a retentate where solutes are concentrated and have to be properly managed and discharged to date little is known on how the selection of a semi permeable dense membrane impacts the dissolved organic matter in the concentrate and what the consequences are for micropollutant mp abatement and bromate formation during concentrate treatment with ozone laboratory ozonation experiments were performed with standardized concentrates produced by three membranes two nfs and one low pressure reverse osmosis lpro membrane from three water sources two river waters and one lake water the concentrates were standardized by adjustment of ph and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon total inorganic carbon selected micropollutants mp with a low to high ozone reactivity and bromide to exclude factors which are known to impact ozonation nf membranes had a lower retention of bromide and mps than the lpro membrane and if the permeate quality of the nf membrane meets the requirements the selection of this membrane type is beneficial due to the lower bromate formation risks upon concentrate ozonation the bromate formation was typically higher in standardized concentrates of lpro than of nf membranes but the tradeoff between mp abatement and bromate formation upon ozonation of the standardized concentrates was not affected by the membrane type furthermore there was no difference for the different source waters overall ozonation of concentrates is only feasible for abatement of mps with a high to moderate ozone reactivity with limited bromate formation differences in the dom composition between nf and lpro membrane concentrates are less relevant than

proposed an environmental quality standard of 50 Î¼g l 1 oekotoxzentrum 2015 soltermann et al 2016b therefore the application of ozone to abate mps in bromide containing concentrates is always a tradeoff between the desired mp abatement and the undesired formation of bromate strategies for bromate mitigation during ozone treatment are known and include e g the addition of h2o2 von gunten 2003 h2o2 addition results in the fast transformation of o3 to oh which may reduce bromate formation due to a partial shutdown of a combined oh o3 pathway merle et al 2017 von gunten and hoignÃ© 1994 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in addition the key intermediate hobr obr pk a 8 8 haag and hoignÃ© 1983 heeb et al 2014 is reduced by reactions with h2o2 to br thus lowering the bromate yield von gunten and oliveras 1997 however the addition of h2o2 does not necessarily imply a better tradeoff between bromate yield and mp abatement and experimental proof is required in each case to verify this strategy s success which was outside the scope of this study some studies investigated bromate formation upon ozonation of ro concentrates for mp abatement benner et al 2008 justo et al 2013 king et

bromate formation in membrane concentrates benner et al 2008 justo et al 2013 king et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 studies on ozonation of nf and ro concentrates from river or surface waters are lacking despite the increasing demand for such treatment solutions foureaux et al 2019 guo et al 2022 jÃ¤hrig et al 2018 kiefer et al 2020 in addition the effect of the membrane type on the subsequent concentrate ozonation is not yet well understood due to different rejection performances of nf and ro with respect to doc hco3 co3 2 mps and br both the mp abatement efficiency as well as the risk of bromate formation upon ozonation are expected to differ between different membranes in addition hypothetically differences in the dom compositions of nf and lpro concentrates might exist if small dom moieties are rejected by ro but not by nf and these could possibly influence e g the ozone chemistry and the ensuing o3 and oh exposures this study investigates the ozone treatment of concentrates from different nf and lpro membranes that were applied to reject mps in different surface water sources specifically this study aims to investigate how hypothetically differing dom compositions in nf and ro concentrates impact the abatement of mps the formation of bromate and the tradeoff between mp abatement and bromate formation upon ozone treatment two river water rapid sand filtrates waters

permeate flow of 200 l h 1 water recovery of 85 achieved by adjusting a concentrate volume flow of 35 3 l h 1 and a loop volume flow before the membrane of 1 m3 h 1 the plant was left to run at least

bottle during this time the permeate was discarded into a separate permeate tank so that the feed water was not altered by dilution with permeate the concentrates were standardized before ozone treatment to guarantee good comparability the standardization protocol is described in text s1 si in brief the concentrates were adjusted to the same ph 8 3 0 1 and concentrations of doc tic selected mps table 2 bromide and borate buffer 10 mm mps were selected to represent a broad range of second order rate constants table s4 si provides water quality parameters before ozonation of the different

mps never exceeded 0 2 105 s 1 and was typically 10 of s therefore the spiked mps did not significantly interfere with the ozonation conditions and the results can be transferred to real i e non spiked samples the standardized concentrates were ozonated at different specific ozone doses to investigate the abatement of mps and formation of bro3 details on the experimental standard protocol are provided in text s2 si in brief aliquots of the standardized concentrates were filled in glass vials subsequently ozone was added from an ozone stock solution with a known ozone concentration analytical methods the analytical methods are described in detail in text s3 si together with the limits of quantification methods accuracies and the measurement ranges in brief the electron donating capacity edc was measured according to a modified standard protocol walpen et al 2020 by adding the radical cation of 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts to dilution series of each concentrate buffered at ph 8 3 with 10 mm borate and subsequent measurement of the absorbance at 728 nm after 15 min reaction time dom was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography sec coupled with an organic carbon detector ocd and an ultraviolet detector uvd at 254 nm model 8b doc labor dr huber germany micropollutants were measured by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography uhplc coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ms ms bromide and bromate were separated by ion chromatography ic and measured by an inductively coupled plasma icp coupled with ms ms results and discussion membrane performance the relative retentions of doc br and mps in bench scale experiments with flat sheet membranes are provided in table 3 note that for the lpro membrane retentions of several mps were reported before with the same feed water rr raw water at a somewhat higher transmembrane pressure i e at 7 bar roth et al 2021 while the doc retentions were similar for all membranes the membrane types strongly differ in their retentions of bromide and mps this means that the doc is more efficiently concentrated in nf concentrates than br in contrast in lpro concentrates doc and br are concentrated to the same extent in turn this should make the nf concentrates more feasible than the lpro concentrate for ozonation at similar specific ozone doses because the relatively lower br concentrations mean a lower bromate formation potential nevertheless the membrane selection is typically determined by the permeate quality requirements with respect to the target mp concentrations in the permeate to this end lpro membranes produce a permeate with a higher quality bromide is not regulated in the drinking water because br itself is not relevant for human health hence higher br concentrations in the nf permeate than in the lpro concentrate are acceptable unless the permeate is treated e g with chlorine based processes e g for disinfection in this case higher br concentrations are associated with an increased risk for the formation of bromine containing disinfection byproducts dbps which are generally more toxic than the chlorine analogues heeb et al 2014 regli et al 2015 wagner and plewa 2017 however the risk for dbp formation is lower in the nf permeate compared to the nf feed due to the lower dom concentrations as dom is the main precursor of dbps sharma et al 2014 characterization of standardized concentrates the edc was measured as a parameter determining the phenol content of dom which is mostly responsible for the initial ozone demand aeschbacher et al 2010 houska et al 2021 a high edc indicates a high concentration of o3 reactive moieties walpen et al 2020 which for a given specific ozone dose might result in a lower o3 exposure results of edc measurements of the non standardized concentrates are shown in table 4 the absolute edcs of standardized concentrates shown in the second rows of each cell in table 4 varied within a factor of 2 2 and depended on the water source i e the same order was observed for all investigated membranes rw rr lb sec ocd or sec uvd chromatograms were not useful to detect differences between the standardized concentrates data not shown minor differences were observed with respect to the water sources which is explained by their different catchment areas the membrane selection did not impact the sec chromatograms the specific uv absorbances at 254 nm suva254 of the standardized concentrates were similar within the standard uncertainty 0 7 l mgc 1 m 1 estimated by the gaussian error propagation rule table s4 si treatment of standardized concentrates data of all mp abatements and molar bromate yields are provided in the dataset csv file si and discussed below abatement of micropollutants the results for the abatement of mps during ozonation are shown in figure s3 si the abatement of mps follows the order atz ibu bzf bta ato cbz dcf this agrees with the order expected from the second order rate constants for reactions of the mps with o3 and oh table 2 in the following mps with a high ozone reactivity are discussed which are almost exclusively abated by reactions with o3 group i i e cbz and dcf then o3 resistant mps are discussed because their abatement can be mostly explained by reactions with oh groups iii and iv i e ibu and atz respectively finally mps with a moderate ozone reactivity are discussed where both reactions with o3 and oh are important for their abatement group ii i e ato bta and bzf micropollutants with high ozone reactivity mps with high ozone reactivity such as cbz or dcf table 2 are abated to high extents even at relatively low specific o3 doses typically these compounds are abated predominantly by direct reactions with o3 lee and von gunten 2016 at about 0 2 mg o3 mg doc 1 cbz fig 1 a and dcf figure s4a si were abated by 67 to 86 and 74 to 90 respectively in different standardized concentrates with different raw waters fig 1b and c show the differences of the relative cbz abatements of lb and rr compared to rw respectively for specific ozone doses of 0 2 and 0 3 mg o3 mg doc 1 all differences between lb or rr and rw were significantly 0 p 0 05 which means a lower cbz abatement in rw compared to the other water resources the lower differences of about 5 between rw and the other water sources at a specific ozone dose of 0 3 mg o3 mg doc 1 can be explained by the already very high relative abatements of cbz close to 100 no statistically significant differences were observed comparing cbz abatements of rr and lb similar results were obtained for dcf at 0 2 mg o3 mg doc 1 figure s4b si at 0 3 mg o3 mg doc 1 dcf was already abated to residual concentrations below the limit of quantification figure s4 si for both mps the membrane type did not have a statistically significant impact on their abetment in standardized concentrates based on the edc values table 4 for a given specific ozone dose the ozone exposures were expected to follow the order rw rr lb therefore a lower abatement efficiency for cbz and dcf abatements in rw than in rr or lb can be expected which is consistent with the obtained results in fig 1 and s4 si this highlights that the ozone exposure was rather impacted by the water source and not by the membrane type ozone resistant micropollutants atz and ibu are almost exclusively abated by reactions with oh table 2 it is known that the oh exposure can be calculated from the abatement of an ozone resistant probe compound acero et al 2000 huber et al 2003 hÃ¼bner et al 2013 lee et al 2013 zucker et al 2016 according to eq 4 4 ln c mp c mp 0 k oh mp c oh dt k o 3 mp c o 3 dt 0 c mp 0 and c mp are the concentrations of a mp before and after ozonation respectively c oh and c o 3 are the time dependent concentrations of oh and o3 during ozonation respectively ibu was used as a reference compound to assess the oh exposure of the standardized concentrates no statistically significant differences were found that indicated an impact of the membrane type or water source on the oh exposure with small and similar contributions of reactions with ozone table 2 the ratio of k oh ibu k oh atz 3 0 0 6 standard deviation calculated by gaussian error propagation rule determines the expected ratio of ln abatements of these two mps black dashed line in figure s5 si however the average ratio of the observed second order rate constants was 1 4 i e about half the expected ratio regardless of the water source or the membrane used no analytical issues were observed for any of the mps discussed here i e linearity of the calibrations was acceptable throughout all measurements r2 0 995 for all mps and matrix effects could be excluded from measurements of the mp recovery after spiking both in ozonated and non ozonated concentrates the abatement of ibu was consistent with other mps discussed below hence atz was likely abated faster than expected for unknown reasons further kinetic studies involving competition kinetics between atz and ibu are required to elucidate the reasons of this observation therefore in the following the discussions are based on ibu micropollutants with moderate ozone reactivity three mps with moderate ozone reactivities were investigated in this study i e ato bta and bzf their abatement is expected to occur both by reactions with o3 and oh plots of the negative natural logarithm of relative residual concentrations of bta and bzf are shown in fig 2 as functions of the negative natural logarithm of relative residual concentrations of ibu as oh reference compound the plots indicate that significant contributions of o3 reactions only occurred at specific ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc 1 highlighted data from experiments with rr standardized concentrates in fig 2 because below this specific ozone dose abatements of bta and bzf did not significantly exceed the abatement expected from reactions with oh based ibu as oh reference compound based on the significant second order rate constants for the reactions of bzf and bta with ozone table 2 a more pronounced difference would have been expected if the ozone exposures were significant for specific ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc 1 these observations can be explained by a fast initial consumption of o3 likely by fast reacting phenolic dom moieties houska et al 2021 Ã¶nnby et al 2018 yielding partially oh therefore contributions of reactions with o3 to the abatement of mps such as bta and bzf become more important when these dom moieties are abated chon et al 2015 formation of bromate upon ozonation bromate can be formed from bromide by a complex reaction mechanism including both o3 and oh von gunten and hoignÃ© 1994 von gunten and oliveras 1998 results for Î· upon ozonation of the standardized concentrates are presented in fig 3 for example at a specific o3 dose of about 0 4 mg o3 mg doc 1 15 2 Î¼g bro3 l 1 were formed on average range 11 to 19 Î¼g bro3 l 1 corresponding to a molar bromate yield Î· of 2 9 0 9 range 1 4 to 3 8 this bromate concentration is above the drinking water standard 10 Î¼g bro3 l 1 but below the proposed swiss environmental quality standard 50 Î¼g bro3 l 1 oekotoxzentrum 2015 soltermann et al 2016b for the same water source membrane specific differences in molar bromate yields were observed i e ozonated lpro membrane concentrates colored symbols in fig 3 typically had higher molar bromate yields than the nf membrane concentrates on average Î· of the standardized lpro membranes was 43 51 higher than for the corresponding nf membranes at specific ozone doses in the range of 0 19 to 0 51 mg o3 mg doc 1 nevertheless no statistical significance was observed except in rw at the highest specific ozone dose 0 9 mg o3 mg doc 1 between lpro and nf2 figure s6 si the observed molar bromate yields are well within the range of those reported previously for municipal wastewater ro reject streams at a specific o3 dose of 0 45 mg o3 mg doc 1 table s1 si king et al 2020 i e 3 1 1 5 range 0 8 to 4 5 similarly at a specific o3 dose of about 0 2 mg o3 mg doc 1 Î· was 1 0 0 4 range 0 5 to 1 4 which is reasonably close to Î· observed by benner et al 2008 1 2 at 0 17 mg o3 mg doc 1 and 1 8 at 0 24 mg o3 mg doc 1 table s1 si benner et al 2008 the good agreement of the results is likely fortuitous because of the differences between the standardized concentrates investigated here and the non standardized municipal wastewater concentrates investigated by king et al 2020 and benner et al 2008 tradeoff between micropollutant abatement and bromate formation fig 4 shows the molar bromate yield in the standardized concentrates as functions of the abatement of representative mps with high dcf group i and moderate bta and ato group ii ozone reactivity and mps of an ozone resistant compound ibu group iii dcf and ato were selected because they were studied before in ozonation of municipal wastewater ro concentrates and data was available for the corresponding bromate formation king et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 ibu was also compared with published results from diethyltoluamide deet even though it has somewhat lower second order rate constants for reactions with o3 k o 3 deet 0 1 m 1 s 1 benitez et al 2013 and oh k oh deet 5 109 m 1 s 1 song et al 2009 i e group iii ozonation of standardized concentrates resulted in very similar abatement trends of mps and formation of bromate for all water sources or the membrane types hence even if the water source or membrane selection impacted the o3 and oh exposures this did not result in a change of the tradeoff between mp abatement and bromate formation this finding is based on the connection of bromate formation and mp abatement by combinations of ozone and oh reactions and the corresponding exposures the results also highlight that the small differences in the dissolved organic matter composition between nf and lpro membrane concentrates are of minor relevance for the treatment efficiency and the tradeoff between mp abatement and bromate formation the data for the treatment of standardized concentrates from surface waters agree well with previously published data from non standardized municipal wastewater ro concentrates king et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 colored open symbols in fig 4 for specific ozone doses 1 0 mg o3 mg doc 1 despite the significantly different water qualities of the ozonated samples fig 4 highlights that the abatement of mps in the standardized concentrates can be divided into three sections i low specific ozone doses 0 1 mg o3 mg doc 1 are sufficient for mps with a high ozone reactivity such as dcf group i fig 4a to be abated by 50 to 60 at a given specific ozone dose molar bromate yields are low with Î· 0 2 ii moderate specific ozone doses in the range of 0 1 to 0 5 mg o3 mg doc 1 lead to an almost complete abatement of mps with a high ozone reactivity group i fig 4a and are sufficient to abate mps with a moderate ozone reactivity such as ato or bta group ii fig 4b by up to 50 to 60 in this range of specific ozone doses the molar bromate yield linearly increases with the abatement of mps and was typically 3 therefore here bromide concentrations should be 200 Î¼g l 1 in the concentrate before ozonation to limit bromate concentrations to the drinking water standard of 10 Î¼g l 1 at specific ozone doses around 0 5 mg o3 mg doc 1 i e which is typical for enhanced wastewater ozonation e g in switzerland this might limit the application of the investigated treatment chain in many cases considering the fact that municipal wastewater ro concentrates can contain bromide in concentrations in the range of 1 to 10 mg l 1 this might result in bromate concentrations around 50 to 500 Î¼g l 1 table s1 si i e in many cases even above the proposed swiss environmental quality standard 50 Î¼g bro3 l 1 oekotoxzentrum 2015 soltermann et al 2016b limiting bromate concentrations to the drinking water standard safeguards that all downstream stakeholders can produce drinking water from the river water riverbank filtrate at any time even in de facto water reuse situations e g as observed in some regions of germany karakurt et al 2019 iii specific ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc 1 are required for an almost complete abatement of mps with a moderate ozone reactivity group ii fig 4b or to abate ozone resistant mps such as ibu group iii fig 4c by 50 for these specific ozone doses bromate formation strongly increases with increasing specific ozone dose an ozonation of concentrates with such specific ozone doses will be challenging considering the high molar bromate yields overall concentrate ozonation with significant abatement of mps and limited bromate formation is only feasible for mps from groups i and ii fig 4a and b evaluation of nf and ro membrane processes in combination with concentrate ozonation ozonation of nf and lpro concentrates were compared to assess the overall performance for mp abatement and bromate formation four types of mp can be distinguished conceptually in process chains consisting of a membrane treatment with a subsequent concentrate ozonation as illustrated in fig 5 i e a b c and d and discussed in table 5 in which the types and examples of mps are described membrane treatment membrane treatment is evaluated by column treatment step 1 in table 5 and reflected by the x axis in fig 5 compounds of types a or b are well retained by the membrane treatment resulting in relatively low concentrations of these compounds in the permeate in contrast compounds of type c or d are retained to relatively low extents a low retention results in relatively high concentrations of these compounds in the permeate for this evaluation the available experimental data with rr raw water samples was used table 3 concentrate ozonation the concentrate has to be treated for mp abatement before discharge with the corresponding necessary specific o3 doses to comply with the local discharge limits for mps and bromate the abatement of the selected compounds upon ozonation of the concentrate is evaluated in table 5 column treatment step 2 this evaluation is based on experimental data for the abatement of bta dcf and ibu at specific ozone doses in the range of 0 24 to 0 61 mg o3 mg doc 1 and the corresponding molar bromate yields for a non standardized rw lpro concentrate this water source is different from membrane retention evaluation rr however based on the findings presented above it can be assumed that the mp abatement by ozonation is not significantly different for the different water sources in this study this is not always the case because o3 and oh exposures can significantly vary between real water sources due to differences e g in the specific nom s ozone reactivity oh yield and oh scavenging by the water background matrix elovitz and von gunten 1999 staehelin and hoignÃ© 1985 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the abatements of mps in the non standardized lpro concentrate were comparable with those in the standardized lpro concentrate text s4 and figure s7 si however the molar bromate yields in the non standardized lpro concentrate were only about half the yields of the standardized lpro concentrate at comparable specific o3 doses figure s8 si this is likely explained by the different ratios of br dom and br s between the standardized and non standardized concentrates and the different ph values the abatements of the ozone resistant mps iopromide ipr group iv and metformin met group v upon ozonation of the non standardized lpro concentrate were estimated based on the calculated oh exposure from the abatement of ibu as oh probe compound acero et al 2000 huber et al 2003 hÃ¼bner et al 2013 lee et al 2013 zucker et al 2016 the calculations were performed with eq 4 and the corresponding second order rate constants for the reactions with oh i e k oh ipr 0 8 109 m 1 s 1 huber et al 2003 and k oh met 0 5 0 8 109 m 1 s 1 average and standard deviation of three reported values fu et al 2019 kaiser et al 2013 minella et al 2017 for compounds of type a or c mps of groups i and ii lee et al 2013 in fig 5a good abatement during ozonation of the concentrate can be expected at specific ozone doses 0 6 mg o3 mg doc 1 in contrast compounds type b or d are hardly abated during ozonation with specific o3 doses 0 6 mg o3 mg doc 1 for an overall solution for mps the investigated treatment chain is well suited for type a compounds fig 5 such as dcf table 5 because they are well retained at the membrane and abated to high extends upon ozonation compounds of type b fig 5 such as ipr table 5 are well retained at the membrane but their abatement in ozone treatment of the concentrate is limited an additional treatment after ozonation such as activated carbon could improve the treated concentrate s quality to comply with the treatment goal ahn et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 hypothetical type c compounds fig 5 bta for nf1 in table 5 are retained to low extends by the nf1 membrane only if retained these compounds are well abated in the ozone treatment of the concentrate for lpro there are no known compounds which fulfill these criteria the worst case for the treatment chain are compounds of type d fig 5 met for nf1 in table 5 no compounds for lpro as they are hardly retained and hardly abated by ozone treatment in the concentrate in general for lpro there are only very few examples which fulfill the criteria for type d such as chloroform and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma marron et al 2019 for compounds of type c and d the selection of a denser membrane might be suitable to improve the retention of such compounds as in the case of bta and met table 5 compare columns nf1 and lpro this can turn a compound type c to type a fig 5 e g bta in table 5 and a compound type d to type b fig 5 e g met in table 5 nevertheless for met a different concentrate treatment will be necessary e g by a biological treatment scheurer et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 overall assessment of process combination along with the retention of mps and their abatement during ozonation of the concentrate the retention of br and the formation of bro3 during concentrate ozonation is important for the assessment of the whole process train an excessive formation of bromate might limit the application of the proposed process combination to compare the bromate formation risk for ozonation of nf1 and lpro concentrates the experimentally determined br retention values table 3 were used to calculate br levels in the concentrates given the retention r of a solute i at the membrane the concentration in the concentrate can be calculated according to eq 5 5 c concentrate i c feed i 1 w 1 r i 1 w c feed i and c concentrate i are the concentrations in the membrane feed and the concentrate respectively w is the water recovery which was assumed to be 85 as in the production of the non standardized concentrates bromide rejection r b r is known at w 75 for a rr sample and assumed to be the same at w 85 for a rw sample table 3 as a result the br concentrations in nf1 and lpro concentrates are 2 2 c feed b r and 6 4 c feed b r respectively since the bromate formation is roughly proportional to the bromide concentration the extent of bromate formation is about three times lower in the nf1 concentrate than in the lpro concentrate to estimate the bromate concentrations upon concentrate ozonation the resulting bromide concentration was multiplied with the experimentally determined molar bromate yields as discussed before Î· of standardized nf1 concentrates were about 40 lower than the standardized lpro concentrates but no statistically relevant differences were found for specific o3 doses 0 9 mg o3 mg doc 1 therefore non standardized nf1 concentrates were assumed to have the same Î· as the non standardized lpro concentrate which is a worst case scenario for the nf1 concentrate treatment combining this information bromate concentrations in the nf concentrate are estimated in the range of 0 4 to 3 4 c feed b r m w bro 3 m w b r and for the lpro concentrate in the range of 1 3 to 9 7 c feed b r m w bro 3 m w b r respectively depending on the investigated specific o3 dose estimated bromate concentrations after ozone treatment of nf1 or lpro concentrates at the investigated specific ozone doses are shown in figure s9 si as functions of the bromide concentration in the membrane feed to limit bromate concentrations in the treated concentrates to 10 Î¼g l 1 here c feed b r must therefore be 185 Î¼g l 1 or 65 Î¼g l 1 for the nf1 or lpro membrane respectively for concentrate treatment with 0 61 mg o3 mg doc 1 and without additional bromate mitigation strategies in contrast if br is present in the membrane feed at concentrations 1 5 mg l 1 and 480 Î¼g l 1 here specific o3 doses of 0 24 mg o3 mg doc 1 can be used in the ozone treatment of nf1 or lpro concentrates respectively to limit bromate concentrations to 10 Î¼g l 1 figure s9 si overall the permeate quality with respect to mp concentrations is determined by the selection of the membrane denser lpro membranes must be selected if only very low mp concentrations are acceptable in the permeate however this also considerably increases the risk of bromate formation to limit bromate formation during the subsequent ozonation of concentrates to an acceptable level only low to moderate specific o3 doses can be used in the ozone treatment of the concentrate and hence significant abatement can only be expected for mps with a high or moderate ozone reactivity the composition of real concentrates produced by different membranes from the same water source will differ due to varying relative rejections of compounds as described above therefore in real concentrates the ph and concentrations of dom hco3 co3 2 and br will vary as well as concentrations of mps in addition bro3 is formed in a complex pathway involving both reactions with o3 and oh therefore all water parameters affecting these oxidant exposures can ultimately result in changes of the bromate yield elovitz et al 2000 von gunten and hoignÃ© 1994 without standardization it would be difficult to compare different concentrates in terms of the trade off between mp abatement and bro3 formation standardization of the concentrates allows to eliminate the above known parameters impacting mp abatement and bromate formation and therefore allows the assessment of the impact of water source and membrane type on the ozone treatment of the concentrate however the transferability of the obtained results to real concentrates has limitations nevertheless a reasonable agreement with real concentrates was found fig 4 one main finding of this study is that the selection of a nf membrane minimizes the risk of bromate formation during ozonation of concentrates due to the lower relative bromide retention by the membrane compared to a lpro membrane this conclusion is valid despite all limitations on transferability as the bromate yield is roughly proportional to the bromide concentration elovitz et al 2000 soltermann et al 2016a von gunten and hoignÃ© 1994 conclusion concentrates of the rivers rhine rr and wiese rw and of lake biel lb waters were obtained from a low pressure reverse osmosis lpro membrane and two nanofiltration nf membranes after standardization of the concentrates at ph 8 3 0 1 and the same concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc total inorganic carbon tic bromide br and spiked micropollutants mps the impact of the membrane selection and raw water type upon ozonation was investigated the following conclusions can be drawn it was demonstrated that the water source was the main factor impacting the electron donating capacity edc the expected lower ozone exposures for higher edcs are consistent with the lower abatement of diclofenac and carbamazepine in waters with higher edcs rw rr lb upon ozonation of the standardized concentrates the investigated mps atenolol atrazine benzotriazole bezafibrate carbamazepine diclofenac ibuprofen were abated to different extents in agreement with their second order rate constants for the reactions with o3 and oh the tradeoff between the desired mp abatement and undesired bromate formation was neither impacted by the water source nor by the membrane type ozonation of concentrates at limited bromate formation was only feasible for mps with a high or moderate ozone reactivity an assessment of the mp abatement and bromate formed upon ozonation for non standardized concentrates highlighted the interplay of the membrane and the subsequent concentrate treatment the lpro membrane had a higher retention of mps and bromide than the investigated nf membranes nevertheless for lower mp retention requirements nf membranes might be a better choice because their concentrates will lead to lower bromate concentrations upon ozonation the elevated bromide concentrations in nf permeates are considered not to be an issue unless chlorine based treatments are used e g for permeate disinfection however the risk of brominated disinfection byproducts formation is lower in the nf permeate compared to the nf feed due to the rejection of dissolved organic matter in nf treatment the main precursor of such compounds in addition the lower dom concentrations typically allow to apply a lower chlorine dose which additionally reduces the risk of dbp formation declaration

15782,worldwide vanadium contamination is posing serious risks to ecosystems although abilities of microbial communities to cope with vanadium stress using specific survival strategies have been reported little is known regarding their relative importance and the underlying detoxification tolerance mechanisms herein we investigated the potential survival strategies of microbial communities

other pure isolates also have the survival strategy that tolerates vanadium through metal resistance genes fierros romero et al 2017 microbial responses to vanadium stress have been revealed at the community level in riverine habitats kamika and momba 2014 zhang et al 2019 however the integrated investigation on these survival strategies for microbial adaption to vanadium in natural aquatic environments remains largely unknown detailed detoxification tolerance pathways for functional species in these communities are still not fully understood in order to bridge these knowledge gaps water

data were analyzed using excel with the exhibition of the mean value and standard error principal coordinates analysis pcoa was conducted to depict the shift of microbial communities in response to the vanadium contamination the abundance of phylum data was visualized via circos software http circos ca http circos ca heatmap was performed based on the relative abundance of functional genera using origin 8 5 software co occurrence network analysis of bacteria otus was carried out using gephi with input correlations calculated by the r package wang et al 2022b the network topological

vanadium on the alpha diversities of bacterial communities 3 results and discussion 3 1 aquatic environment characteristics the physicochemical properties of sampling habitats were measured and visualized in the aqueous phase fig 1 a the average total vanadium concentration in the polluted stream was 7 00 4 56 mg l 140 times higher than that of the drink water limit of vanadium proposed by the us epa 0 05 mg l espÃ³sito et al 2011 the serious vanadium contamination might be due to the waste discharge during long term vanadium production activities wang and yang 2016 yang et al 2017 the vanadium concentration in the polluted stream varied significantly and was relatively low in summer and autumn figure s2 and the content of ti and zn also exhibited the similar trend the high river mass flow would dilute the content of heavy metals in the water phase during wet seasons summer and autumn in this study leading to the decreased concentrations of heavy metals in water prartono et al 2016 inconsistency also occurred for other metals probably due to the enhanced migration of these metals from sediments to the water phase through desorption under high temperatures in summer and autumn miranda et al 2022 zhao et al 2014 comparatively the average vanadium concentration in jinsha river was 0 01 0 01 mg l with smaller temporal fluctuation similar to previous findings yin et al 2022 other metal ions from vanadium bearing minerals including cr ti fe and zn also significantly showed higher concentration levels in the polluted stream than in jinsha river more nutrients such as organics nitrogen and phosphorus were detected in the polluted stream compared to jinsha river the surrounding agricultural activity and residents daily life might cause this contamination in the stream camargo et al 2005 furthermore ammonia salts are the common precipitant in vanadium metallurgical industries fang et al 2017 they and their oxidizing products i e nitrate could also appear in the drainage with higher concentrations for sediments the average total vanadium content reached 832 1 364 2 mg kg in the polluted stream fig 1 b which was significantly higher than the china soil background value 82 mg kg chen et al 1991 a larger seasonal variation was also exhibited figure s2 vanadium in the water tended to precipitate onto sediments and also might be adsorbed by sediments zhang et al 2019 shaheen et al 2019 in contrast low average concentrations of vanadium 75 6 12 1 mg kg were found in jinsha river sediments the content levels of accompanied metals were much higher in the polluted stream than in jinsha river as the dilution effect in the large river more abundant nutrients were found in the polluted stream than in jinsha river sediments could adsorb nutrients from water leading to their accumulations in sediments zhang et al 2020 3 2 microbial community structures the polluted stream possessed close levels of community richness and diversity to jinsha river in water as indicated by ace and shannon estimators fig 2 a in sediments relatively lower richness was detected in the polluted stream compared to jinsha river as for seasonal variations the lower richness of microbial communities was observed from all samples collected in spring while higher bacterial diversity was found in autumn of water samples and summer of sediment samples from both the polluted stream and the jinsha river figure s3 suggesting that seasonality markedly determined variations in structure and diversity of microbial communities in this aquatic ecosystem chen et al 2019 microbial communities in the aqueous phase and sedimentary medium formed distinct clusters in the pcoa diagram fig 2 b suggesting the obvious difference in microbial community between these two media proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in all samples figure s4 with relative abundance ranging from 30 6 to 55 8 followed by actinobacteria 10 8 23 9 and firmicutes 9 27 30 0 and these three phyla were also prevalently found in other vanadium contaminated systems wang et al 2020a cao et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in the present study the abundance of proteobacteria phyla was found significantly p 0 001 lower in water samples in the polluted stream than jinsha river firmicutes was observed higher p 0 01 in water samples from the polluted stream while no significant difference was found in the abundance of actinobacteria between the polluted stream than jinsha river in both water and sediments besides in the aqueous phase more patescibacteria were found in the polluted stream 12 6 than jinsha river 1 35 in sediments chloroflexi appeared widely with an average relative abundance of 7 73 in both polluted stream and jinsha river while more bacteroidetes 9 46 but fewer cyanobacteria 0 92 existed in the polluted stream than jinsha river 5 75 4 55 importantly typical vv reducing and resistant related genera were characterized in these riverine habitats possibly suggesting the adaption of microbial communities to the high grade vanadium stress fig 2 c these functional genera were widely distributed in the aqueous and solid media which have been reported to possess the ability to reduce vv via enzyme catalysis or electron transfer and tolerate vanadium through metal resistance genes in particular arthrobacter appeared abundantly in all samples with an average relative abundance of 3 80 and this genus had been reported as vanadium resistant genera due to their vanadium resistance gene chra encoding the vanadate resistance protein chra almeida et al 2020 henne et al 2009 yu et al 2020 more clostridium existed in water 4 80 and sediment 1 97 samples of the polluted stream compared with that in jinsha river 0 06 0 58 and its relative abundance maximized in spring in water figure s5 this genus possessed the ability to reduce vv through enzymatic activity xu et al 2015 there was more pseudomonas in water phase of jinsha river 2 64 on average whose vv reduction ability through nitrate reductase and electron transfer had been established antipov et al 2000 dechloromonas possessed higher relative abundance in jinsha river sediments but higher existed in the water of polluted stream 0 03 than jinsha river 0 00 which could promote vv bio reduction coupled with nitrate removal and hydrogen oxidation jiang et al 2018 other vanadium reduction or resistant genera 2 99 in water 1 97 in sediments including acinetobacter thauera thiobacillus and streptococcus were widely distributed in both water and sediments of the polluted stream rather than in the jinsha river 0 64 in water 0 31 in sediments although the abilities of vv reduction had not been reported some discovered genera could reduce or resist heavy metals such as sphingopyxis to cr vi prabhakaran et al 2019 nocardioides to cu ii xavier et al 2019 they might also detoxify vanadium through similar pathways with structural similarity through metal resistances or denitrification genes in brief the existence of these functional genera with the ability of vv reducing and resistant related genera implied the potential of three kinds of survival pathways to the vanadium stress the co occurrence patterns of microbial communities were performed by interactive network analyses based on the strong spearman r 0 850 and significant p 0 001 relationships typical modular configurations were observed in microbial community networks for both water figure s6a and sediment figure s6b samples with the modularity higher than 0 5 0 806 and 0 833 respectively most microorganisms in both water and sediment exhibited positive relationships table s1 among the co existing taxa proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in both water figure s6a accounting for 42 9 of the total nodes and sediment samples figure s6b accounting for 43 3 followed by actinobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi the sedimentary network possessed a higher average degree 21 6 than that for water 20 2 suggesting that sedimentary microbial community was more complex than that in water moreover the higher average clustering coefficient of the network for sediment samples 0 579 than water 0 568 indicated more tight associations among sedimentary microbes in addition six representative topological properties of networks including node number edge number average degree graph diameter graph density and betweenness centralization exhibited no significant difference between the polluted stream and jinsha river in water or sediment samples figure s7 overall the positive and modular interactions among individual microbial taxa were found in these vanadium influenced aquatic environments this potentially indicated cooperative associations within microbial taxa marcos et al 2019 and strong stability of microbial communities hernandez et al 2021 which helped microbes more tolerant to the stress imposed by vanadium chen et al 2022 moreover potential keystone taxa were also identified in co occurrence networks for both water table s2 and sediment table s3 intriguingly most potential keystone taxa could be involved in heavy metal resistance heavy metal reduction and nutrient metabolisms possibly suggesting their excellent capabilities in adapting to heavy metal contaminations and mediating fundamental biogeochemical processes particularly geobacter was identified as a keystone genus in water samples and also as a potential functional genus with the vanadium reducing ability table s2 fig 2 c as proved by previous studies keystone taxa play an important role in maintaining the stability of microbial community and mediating community response to multiple metal contaminations sun et al 2013 yang et al 2022 moreover keystone taxa also cooperatively interacted with other bacteria and these frequent cooperative interactions not only serve as the crucial parts for energy flowing and matter cycling but also contribute to the microbial communities surviving in this high vanadium stress environment 3 3 influence of vanadium on community structure rda was performed to explore the influence of physicochemical parameters on bacterial genera as shown in fig 3 a b rda1 and rda2 jointly explained 55 9 and 84 8 of the total variance of microbial communities in water and sediment respectively for bacteria in water vanadium fe zn ti and ph were identified as the important drivers for shaping the microbial community structure fig 3 a metals including ti zn and fe were close to the vanadium mainly because of the release from vanadium mining relevance activities for sedimentary microbes the contents of cr ap nh4 n vanadium and no3 n were the most important parameters in shifting the microbial communities fig 3 b almost all the parameters showed a positive correlation because they were almost distributed into the same quadrants zhang et al 2021c consistent with the previous findings zhang et al 2019 vanadium and its production related factors could shift the microbial community in both water and sediment sems were further conducted to quantify the direct and indirect effects of physicochemical factors on alpha diversity of microbial communities as a result vanadium content was found to indirectly affect the bacterial diversity in water fig 3 c while directly and indirectly influence bacterial diversity in sediment fig 3 d for microbes in aqueous medium considering standardized total influences the direct factors influencing the variance of bacterial diversity followed the order toc Î» 0 569 no3 n Î» 0 438 and nh4 n Î» 0 413 in addition vanadium exerted a significant positive direct effect Î» 0 812 p 0 001 on the content of nh4 n which positively influenced bacterial diversity through both direct and indirect ways the impacts of vanadium production on physicochemical parameters especially nutrients have been widely reported zhang et al 2019 yin et al 2022 as for the sedimentary bacteria the content of vanadium imposed a directly positive effect on both the abundance Î» 0 712 p 0 001 and diversity Î» 0 690 of microbial communities besides vanadium could indirectly affect bacterial abundance and diversity through other factors such as ph Î» 0 699 p 0 05 and om Î» 0 720 p 0 001 which were positively influenced by vanadium and indirectly determined microbial alpha diversity together with previous research in a heavy metal polluted environment xavier et al 2019 our findings suggested that vanadium played an indispensable role in affecting microbial community structure and the diversity under vanadium contamination with vanadium stress diverse survival strategies of microbial communities would be inspired thereby different community metabolic characteristics including regulation transportation resistance and metabolism would be genetically evolved to adapt to the changing surrounding environment xavier et al 2019 3 4 survival strategies of microbes to vanadium shotgun metagenomic analysis was performed to infer the survival strategies of the innate microbes especially the putative vrb by detecting the presence of vanadium related genes and pathways a total of 198 high quality mags with at least 70 completeness and less than 10 contamination were retrieved fig 4 a these mags were phylogenetically assigned to seventeen phyla among which proteobacteria actinobacteriota planctomycetota verrucomicrobiota and bacteroidota had predominant abundances in all samples respectively accounting for 26 9 18 0 4 29 2 05 and 1 19 of the total mags more importantly the vanadium adaption related genes were searched for each mag a total of eleven crucial functional genes previously confirmed to be responsible for three survival strategies of microorganisms under vanadium stress were identified in this polluted environment specifically denitrification genes included dissimilatory nitrate reductase narg antipov et al 2000 nitrate reductase gene napa he et al 2021 and nitrite reductase gene nirs zhang et al 2021a reported participating in vanadium reduction could be carried by 33 14 and 5 mags respectively besides outer membrane cytochrome genes omcab sun et al 2020 myers et al 2004 and glutathione reductase genes gsr ueki and adi 2019 as typical electron transfer genes catalyzing the vanadium reduction were found to be encoded by 3 14 and 56 mags respectively a total of 91 mags containing the mentioned denitrification genes or electron transfer genes were regarded as the putative vrb in addition vanadium resistance related genes including smta smtb czcd cnrb and chra promoting the adaptation of microbes to vanadium were also widely detected in 166 mags among these vanadium resistance genes chra cnrb and czcd were the most frequent genes and respectively identified in 113 89 and 73 mags intriguingly 25 mags were found to carry metabolic genes associated with denitrification electron transfer and vanadium resistance indicating the diverse and cooperative survival strategies of these microorganisms under the vanadium stress in this aquatic environment from the perspective of phylogenetic taxonomy of the 91 vrb figure s8a gsr napa and nirs were mainly carried by proteobacteria while omcb and narg were tightly associated with mags belonging to planctomycetota and actinobacteriota respectively at the genus level gsr in sedimentary mags was frequently possessed by pseudomonas aliihoeflea and sphingopyxis narg in water was carried by nocardioides janibacter and kocuria napa tended to be linked to pseudomonas and shinella figure s8b particularly these vrb might not only carry 1 3 kinds of vanadium reduction genes but also contain multiple vanadium resistance genes fig 4 a which promoted these vrbs to play a competitive advantage in vanadium polluted environments through reducing and tolerating vanadium actually in addition to the retrieved mags other unknown microorganisms without complete genomes could also show the ability to detoxify vanadium through vv reducing and resistance genes therefore we further evaluated the contribution of the three survival strategies to microbial communities in this system in terms of the distribution of the above 11 key functional genes in water and sediment habitats fig 4 b electron transfer genes exhibited a predominant abundance 691 coverage gb in water and 930 coverage gb in sediment higher than that of denitrification genes 219 in water and 85 7 in sediment and resistance genes 321 in water and 268 in sediment indicating the remarkable role of electron transfer genes in response to vanadium contamination especially omcb as the vanadium reduction genes 669 coverage gb followed by narg 214 and gsr 22 3 showed the highest abundance and mainly contributed to vanadium reduction in water and the same was true in sediments omcb 857 narg 215 gsr 72 9 the electron transfer process was reported to widely happen in the environment with abundant redox active metal minerals shi et al 2016 and this vanadium detoxification way could be the main contributor to microbial adaptation in this vanadium contaminated environment due to the frequent redox conversion during microbial metabolisms borch et al 2010 sosa 2018 in comparison the enzyme catalysis strategy based on denitrification genes requires abundant nitrate reductase which would limit their contribution to vanadium detoxication process in this aquatic ecosystem he et al 2021 in addition multiple heavy metal resistances of diverse microorganisms contribute to tolerating and defending the toxicity of metals especially vanadium thus maintaining the structure and function stability of the microbial community under contaminated conditions voica et al 2016 3 5 metabolic potentials of the putative vrb in order to evaluate the metabolic potentials of the putative vrb metabolic genes related to vv reduction and metal resistance accompanied with carbon metabolism nitrogen metabolism and sulfur metabolism were investigated for the acquired 91 mags fig 5 within the carbon mechanism pentose phosphate pathway non oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle tca and pentose phosphate pathway oxidative respectively identified in 63 45 and 44 mags were the most common carbon metabolism pathway however no complete pathway for the wood ljungdahl pathway hydroxypropionate hydroxybutylate cycle dicarboxylate hydroxybutyrate cycle and 3 hydroxypropionate bi cycle was identified in these mags the wood ljungdahl pathway was found to usually exist under anoxic conditions to reduce co2 or oxidize acetate to co2 and h2 jiao et al 2021 so it seldom occurred in this aquatic environment among six nitrogen metabolism modules genes related to dissimilatory nitrate reduction could be completely encoded by 19 mags especially the most abundant mag pseudomonas sp bin 105 in addition nitrogen fixation assimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification might be conducted by 4 4 and 3 mags respectively for sulfur metabolism all necessary genes involved in assimilatory sulfate reduction and thiosulfate oxidation by sox complex were found in 20 and 15 mags represented by williamsia sp bin 45 and paracoccus sp bin 172 respectively besides multiple genes conferring resistances to vanadium as cu ag and zn were widely detected in these potential vv reducing mags suggesting their superior capabilities for tolerating the toxicity of multiple heavy metals in this aquatic habitat therefore the diverse metabolism pathways of these functional mags could supply abundant carbon nitrogen as well as sulfur nutrients and develop metal resistance to help them stimulate adaptive strategies in such high vanadium stress condition kuang et al 2016 3 6 conceptual model of the survival strategies for putative vrb recognizing the genetic traits of vrb was of great significance for vanadium bioremediation in metal polluted sites sun et al 2020 however the current knowledge of the potential functional characteristics of vrb was far from satisfactory considering the increasing vanadium contamination here we proposed the conceptual metabolic model for the four representative vrb which had distinct vv reducing pathways and considerable abundances among all retrieved mags gene narg as a member of the dimethyl sulfoxide reductase molybdoenzymes family has been suggested to facilitate the vv reduction in vrb such as polaromonas sp sun et al 2020 in this study nocardioides sp bin 100 was characterized as the most abundant putative vrb that contained narg genes for vv reduction fig 6 a what s more this vrb was also involved in the process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium besides various electron donors such as organic matter inorganic matter and n related electron donors might contribute to the potential of the vv reduction process for this mag complete pathways for inorganic and organic respiration including glycolysis pathway tca cycle pentose phosphate pathway and pyruvate oxidation were also identified in this putative vrb typical abc transporters for organic compounds such as glycine betaine proline glucose and cellobiose were also found in addition no complete carbon fixation pathway was found suggesting its potential for heterotrophic growth in the aquatic environment moreover nocardioides was reported to carry a great abundance of copper resistance genes in a metal contaminated river xavier et al 2019 but identified with diverse metal resistance genes including arsb czcd zitb copc pcoc and znuabc in this aquatic system indicating its genetic potential to resist and excrete multiple heavy metals such as vanadium as co zn and cd in summary nocardioides was first confirmed to have a potential ability of detoxifying and resisting vanadium and this dominant putative vrb also played a crucial role in the survival of microbial communities in this vanadium contaminated system pathways based on intracellular nitrite reductase encoded by gene nirs or nitrate reductase encoded by gene napa had been proposed as the main route for vv reduction by vrb such as lactococcus raffinolactis zhang et al 2021a shi et al 2021 compared with nirs dominated in heterotrophic bioprocesses the gene napa showed a prominent abundance in autotrophic biosystems wang et al 2020b in this study the co occurrence of nirs and napa was frequently detected in azohydromonas sp bin 8 dechloromonas sp bin 15 and skermanella sp bin 24 among them dechloromonas sp bin 15 as the predominant putative vrb fig 6 b could involve in complete dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification processes meanwhile electron donors were also identified such as those from nadh and organic respiration including glycolysis pathway tca cycle pentose phosphate pathway and pyruvate oxidation specifically complete genes associated with the calvin cycle were also found in dechloromonas sp bin 15 indicating their potential for autotrophic growth by employing carbon oxide for synthesizing the cellular materials similar to the previous findings on dechloromonas lin et al 2021 multiple metal resistance genes such as arscr czcabc zitb afuabc cusabr cbib znub and modabc encoded by this versatile vrb would also be helpful for its adaption to vanadium polluted environments notably two putative pathways respectively catalyzed by napa and gsr possibly participated in the reduction of vv in pseudomonas sp bin 105 fig 6 c indicating that this vrb could be a mixotroph that can use both organic and inorganic compounds as electron donors similar with the previous findings on polaromonas spp sun et al 2020 carbohydrate metabolism including the tca cycle pentose phosphate pathway and pyruvate oxidation could be completely performed by this vrb no complete carbon fixation was identified in this mag possibly reflecting its potential for heterotrophic growth particularly this species could have the ability for dissimilatory nitrate reduction and resistance to diverse metals such as vanadium as cu and cd thereby facilitating the detoxification process and its flourishing in harsh vanadium environments in addition pseudomonas was also found to be widely present in other environments with elevated vanadium including soils wang et al 2020a sediments san martÃ­n et al 2021 wastewater lyalkova and yurkova 1992 and bioreactors qiu et al 2017 liu et al 2017 2022 previous studies suggested that the tetraheme cytochrome cyma and the outer membrane cytochrome omcab for vv reduction have been widely reported in shewanella oneidensis myers et al 2004 and polaromonas sp sun et al 2020 during the vv reduction process cyma is identified as the electron transfer intermediate between the quinone quinol pool of the inner membrane and the terminal reductases while omcab as a metal reductase can bind and reduce vanadium however the co occurrence of cyma and omcab genes was not present in any mag obtained in this study and only omcab could be encoded by 18 mags probably suggesting the existence of other electron transfer intermediates such as nadh or organics regarding the strategy based on electron transfer genes omcab for vv reduction uba9464 sp bin 118 as the most abundant vrb encoded omcb was explored considering its potential metabolic characteristics fig 6 d despite the incomplete pathway for carbon fixation complete genes cluster for assimilatory nitrate reduction and nadh as well as resistance genes related with vanadium as cu ag and zn were identified in this mag which could play essential roles in nutrient acquisition energy production and ecological adaption of this heterotrophic vrb in vanadium contamination in brief most of these representative vrb were first identified to possess vanadium reduction and resistant functions through different functional genes which helped them to form various survival strategies to flourish in harsh vanadium environments more importantly these representative putative vrb also have additional environmental functions besides vanadium detoxification specifically nocardioides sp as the most abundant vrb mag was also observed to carry on diverse metal resistance genes including arsb czcd zitb copc pcoc and znuabc promoting its resistance to multiple heavy metals such as vanadium as co zn and cd nocardioides was also reported to degrade micropollutants from the wastewater zhao et al 2021 indicating that the xenobiotics biodegradation potential could be helpful for this putative vrb in adapting to this organic and metal contaminated environment besides dechloromonas sp was found to involve in complete dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification processes due to the presence of relevant nitrogen transformation genes implying its contribution to the nitrogen cycle in this aquatic system dechloromonas with various metal resistance genes was also identified to be dominant under other heavy metal contaminated systems benefiting from its advantages in utilizing energy eliminating radicals and also repairing the damaged cell lin et al 2021 pseudomonas has been reported to not only participate in the vanadium reduction but also fix nitrogen and reduce or resist transition metals fakhar et al 2022 suyal et al 2014 collectively as the key members of the microbial community in this complex environment these putative vrb not only have the ability to detoxify vanadium and resist metals but also exhibited prominent potential in stress adaptation energy flowing and nutrient conversion 4 conclusions this study provides important insights for understanding the response of microbial communities to vanadium in natural aquatic environments high vanadium content played a critical role in shaping the community structure as deciphered by rda and sems analyses meanwhile microorganisms tended to exhibit cooperative interactions in response to vanadium stress furthermore metagenomic technology identified the presence of the three main survival strategies in this vanadium contaminated riverine habitat specifically putative vrb could reduce vanadium via enzyme catalysis or electron transfer and tolerate vanadium through metal resistance process and we proposed that nocardioides sp dechloromonas sp and pseudomonas sp were the representative bacteria significantly contributing to vanadium reduction and resistance in this biosystem besides metabolic potentials of certain new vrb were also shed light on which would be of important guidance for the isolation and application of vrb in the vv bioremediation process overall our study provided fully integrated knowledge of microbial response to vanadium which would be of great significance to developing better strategies for future

15782,worldwide vanadium contamination is posing serious risks to ecosystems although abilities of microbial communities to cope with vanadium stress using specific survival strategies have been reported little is known regarding their relative importance and the underlying detoxification tolerance mechanisms herein we investigated the potential survival strategies of microbial communities and associated pathways in aquatic environments based on geochemistry and molecular biology high vanadium content was observed for both water 12 6 1 15 mg l and sediment 1 18 103 10 4 mg kg in the investigated polluted stream co occurrence network investigation implied that microbial communities showed cooperative interactions to adapt to the vanadium polluted condition vanadium was also characterized as one of the vital factors shaping the community structure via redundancy analysis and structural equation models based on the metagenomic technology three survival strategies including denitrification pathway electron transfer and metal resistance in innate microbes under the vanadium stress were revealed with comprehensively summarized vanadium detoxification tolerance genes remarkable role of electron transfer genes and the prevalent existence of resistance genes during detoxifying vanadium were highlighted overall these findings provide novel insights into survival strategies under the vanadium contamination in aquatic environments which can be of great significance for the identification isolation and application of vanadium reducing bacteria in vanadium bioremediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords vanadium microbial community survival strategies aquatic environment electron transfer metagenomic analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction vanadium a strategic metal is widely employed in various industries including petroleum refining metallurgy material pigments catalysts and production of phthalic anhydrides hao et al 2015 woÅowicz et al 2022 intensive vanadium mining smelting and vanadium related product application have caused serious environmental vanadium pollution high contents of vanadium have been discovered in environmental media around vanadium smelters nedrich et al 2018 wang et al 2020a for instance as high as 30 220 mg l dissolved vanadium were found in the mining activities associated with the wyoming river usa altaf et al 2021 vanadium contamination has been a worldwide environmental problem shi et al 2020a watt et al 2018 excessive vanadium ingestion can influence human health resulting in diseases like renal damage and pulmonary chen and liu 2017 it can also adversely affect the growth of microorganisms plants and animals heinemann et al 2000 zhang et al 2014 in aquatic environments vanadium is mainly present in two oxidation states including 4 and 5 named vanadium iv viv and vanadium v vv wisawapipat and kretzschmar 2017 zhang et al 2018 the reduction of vv to viv has been considered as a detoxification process because insoluble viv is less toxic compared with vv he et al 2021 jiang et al 2018 microbial activities in the river ecosystem play a vital role in energy flow and element cycling satinsky et al 2017 the functions and processes of the microbial community are determined by functional species wei et al 2018 exposure to the toxicity pollutants like heavy metals could shift the microbial community diversity and impair the function of specific microorganisms sun et al 2018 under the long term vanadium stress microbial communities would develop different kinds of survival strategies to mitigate the damage in various vanadium contaminated systems diaby et al 2007 sun et al 2018 it has been reported that the pure culture of microbes can cope with vanadium stress in two ways i e detoxification and tolerance antipov et al 2000 zhang et al 2021a for one thing specific strains namely vv reducing related bacteria vrb detoxify vanadium contamination and transform vv to viv through enzyme catalysis or electron transfer ortiz bernad et al 2004 jiang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a sun et al 2020 for the other pure isolates also have the survival strategy that tolerates vanadium through metal resistance genes fierros romero et al 2017 microbial responses to vanadium stress have been revealed at the community level in riverine habitats kamika and momba 2014 zhang et al 2019 however the integrated investigation on these survival strategies for microbial adaption to vanadium in natural aquatic environments remains largely unknown detailed detoxification tolerance pathways for functional species in these communities are still not fully understood in order to bridge these knowledge gaps water and sediment samples were taken from the polluted stream and the upstream of the receiving jinsha river as a control around a vanadium smelter in panzhihua china the world famous vanadium production region physicochemical factors and bacterial community structure were characterized the impacts of vanadium on microbial communities were evaluated abundances of functional genes and potential metabolic pathways of the in situ vrb were also investigated through metagenomic analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sample collection the stream flowing through a vanadium smelter is located in panzhihua city sichuan province china with jinsha river the upper reaches of the yangtze river as the receiving water body the sampling points were marked in figure s1 water samples sw and

filtrated using 0 22 Î¼m cellulose acetate membranes to capture microbial cells within 24 h wang et al 2022a then filtered membranes and one part of sediments were cooled by dry ice delivered to the laboratory immediately and stored in a 80 c freezer until dna extraction meanwhile the filtered water and the other part of sediments were stored at 4 c for further measurement of physicochemical

was used to determine the content of total vanadium and other metals by icp ms 2 3 community dna extraction and sequencing microbial dna in water and sediments was respectively extracted in triplicate from filtered membranes and well mixed sediments using the fast dna spin kit for soil qiagen ca united states according to the manufacturer s protocol and the triplicate extracts were mixed together

evaluated by ace and shannon estimators using mothur version v 1 30 1 based on otus the taxonomy of all 16s rrna gene sequences was analyzed by rdp classifier version 2 2 http sourceforge net projects rdp classifier against the silva release132 http www arb silva de 16s rrna database using a confidence threshold of 70 the raw data were submitted to the ncbi database with the accession number

were quality filtered trimmed and screened using fastqc andrews 2010 clean reads for each sample were assembled based on megahit with default parameters li et al 2015 then the assembled contigs were used for retrieving metagenome assembled genomes mags by adopting metawrap uritskiy et al 2018 the completeness and contamination of the mags were estimated by checkm and the mags with more than 70 completeness and less than 10 contamination were kept for downstream analysis parks et al 2015 zhang et al 2021b the open reading frames orfs were predicted from assembled contigs by using metagenemark zhu et al 2010 functions of orfs were then annotated against the kegg database via ghostkoala kanehisa et al 2016 the taxonomy of the recovered genomes was determined using a set of 120 universal single copy proteins based on the genome taxonomy database gtdb using gtdb tk parks et al 2018 the coverage of each mag and the abundances of key functional genes were calculated by mapping clean reads with bbmap v 38 26 https sourceforge net projects bbmap with the default parameters the phylogenetic tree of retrieved mags was generated by aligning single copy genes as a maximum likelihood tree through fasttree v 2 1 11 price et al 2010 then visualized by interactive tree of life software itol v 6 3 the metabolic pathway completeness of the retrieved mags was estimated in kegg mapper subsequently the presence of complete metabolic pathways involved in carbon metabolism nitrogen metabolism and sulfur metabolism as well as metabolic genes related to metal resistance and vanadium reduction were evaluated for each mags the raw metagenome data were submitted to the ncbi database under the accession number prjna795415 2 5 statistical analyses and data visualization all data were analyzed using excel with the exhibition of the mean value and standard error principal coordinates analysis pcoa was conducted to depict the shift of microbial communities in response to the vanadium contamination the abundance of phylum data was visualized via circos software http circos ca http circos ca heatmap was performed based on the relative abundance of functional genera using origin 8 5 software co occurrence network analysis of bacteria otus was carried out using gephi with input correlations calculated by the r package wang et al 2022b the network topological characteristics for each sample were calculated by subgraph function in the igraph package of r potential keystone taxa were identified based on the high degree 50 high closeness centrality 0 30 and low betweenness centrality 600 of otus in co occurrence networks ma et al 2016 yang et al 2022 redundancy analysis rda was performed to identify the relationships between environmental parameters and bacterial taxa using canoco 5 structural equation models sems evaluated through maximum likelihood discrepancy with amos 22 0 byrne 2004 were conducted to assess the direct and indirect effects of vanadium on the alpha diversities of bacterial communities 3 results and discussion 3 1 aquatic environment characteristics the physicochemical properties of sampling habitats were measured and visualized in the aqueous phase fig 1 a the average total vanadium concentration in the polluted stream was 7 00 4 56 mg l 140 times higher than that of the drink water limit of vanadium proposed by the us epa 0 05 mg l espÃ³sito et al 2011 the serious vanadium contamination might be due to the waste discharge during long term vanadium production activities wang and yang 2016 yang et al 2017 the vanadium concentration in the polluted stream varied significantly and was relatively low in summer and autumn figure s2 and the content of ti and zn also exhibited the similar trend the high river mass flow would dilute the content of heavy metals in the water phase during wet seasons summer and autumn in this study leading to the decreased concentrations of heavy metals in water prartono et al 2016 inconsistency also occurred for other metals probably due to the enhanced migration of these metals from sediments to the water phase through desorption under high temperatures in summer and autumn miranda et al 2022 zhao et al 2014 comparatively the average vanadium concentration in jinsha river was 0 01 0 01 mg l with smaller temporal fluctuation similar to previous findings yin et al 2022 other metal ions from vanadium bearing minerals including cr ti fe and zn also significantly showed higher concentration levels in the polluted stream than in jinsha river more nutrients such as organics nitrogen and phosphorus were detected in the polluted stream compared to jinsha river the surrounding agricultural activity and residents daily life might cause this contamination in the stream camargo et al 2005 furthermore ammonia salts are the common precipitant in vanadium metallurgical industries fang et al 2017 they and their oxidizing products i e nitrate could also appear in the drainage with higher concentrations for sediments the average total vanadium content reached 832 1 364 2 mg kg in the polluted stream fig 1 b which was significantly higher than the china soil background value 82 mg kg chen et al 1991 a larger seasonal variation was also exhibited figure s2 vanadium in the water tended to precipitate onto sediments and also might be adsorbed by sediments zhang et al 2019 shaheen et al 2019 in contrast low average concentrations of vanadium 75 6 12 1 mg kg were found in jinsha river sediments the content levels of accompanied metals were much higher in the polluted stream than in jinsha river as the dilution effect in the large river more abundant nutrients were found in the polluted stream than in jinsha river sediments could adsorb nutrients from water leading to their accumulations in sediments zhang et al 2020 3 2 microbial community structures the polluted stream possessed close levels of community richness and diversity to jinsha river in water as indicated by ace and shannon estimators fig 2 a in sediments relatively lower richness was detected in the polluted stream compared to jinsha river as for seasonal variations the lower richness of microbial communities was observed from all samples collected in spring while higher bacterial diversity was found in autumn of water samples and summer of sediment samples from both the polluted stream and the jinsha river figure s3 suggesting that seasonality markedly determined variations in structure and diversity of microbial communities in this aquatic ecosystem chen et al 2019 microbial communities in the aqueous phase and sedimentary medium formed distinct clusters in the pcoa diagram fig 2 b suggesting the obvious difference in microbial community between these two media proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in all samples figure s4 with relative abundance ranging from 30 6 to 55 8 followed by actinobacteria 10 8 23 9 and firmicutes 9 27 30 0 and these three phyla were also prevalently found in other vanadium contaminated systems wang et al 2020a cao et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in the present study the abundance of proteobacteria phyla was found significantly p 0 001 lower in water samples in the polluted stream than jinsha river firmicutes was observed higher p 0 01 in water samples from the polluted stream while no significant difference was found in the abundance of actinobacteria between the polluted stream than jinsha river in both water and sediments besides in the aqueous phase more patescibacteria were found in the polluted stream 12 6 than jinsha river 1 35 in sediments chloroflexi appeared widely with an average relative abundance of 7 73 in both polluted stream and jinsha river while more bacteroidetes 9 46 but fewer cyanobacteria 0 92 existed in the polluted stream than jinsha river 5 75 4 55 importantly typical vv reducing and resistant related genera were characterized in these riverine habitats possibly suggesting the adaption of microbial communities to the high grade vanadium stress fig 2 c these functional genera were widely distributed in the aqueous and solid media which have been reported to possess the ability to reduce vv via enzyme catalysis or electron transfer and tolerate vanadium through metal resistance genes in particular arthrobacter appeared abundantly in all samples with an average relative abundance of 3 80 and this genus had been reported as vanadium resistant genera due to their vanadium resistance gene chra encoding the vanadate resistance protein chra almeida et al 2020 henne et al 2009 yu et al 2020 more clostridium existed in water 4 80 and sediment 1 97 samples of the polluted stream compared with that in jinsha river 0 06 0 58 and its relative abundance maximized in spring in water figure s5 this genus possessed the ability to reduce vv through enzymatic activity xu et al 2015 there was more pseudomonas in water phase of jinsha river 2 64 on average whose vv reduction ability through nitrate reductase and electron transfer had been established antipov et al 2000 dechloromonas possessed higher relative abundance in jinsha river sediments but higher existed in the water of polluted stream 0 03 than jinsha river 0 00 which could promote vv bio reduction coupled with nitrate removal and hydrogen oxidation jiang et al 2018 other vanadium reduction or resistant genera 2 99 in water 1 97 in sediments including acinetobacter thauera thiobacillus and streptococcus were widely distributed in both water and sediments of the polluted stream rather than in the jinsha river 0 64 in water 0 31 in sediments although the abilities of vv reduction had not been reported some discovered genera could reduce or resist heavy metals such as sphingopyxis to cr vi prabhakaran et al 2019 nocardioides to cu ii xavier et al 2019 they might also detoxify vanadium through similar pathways with structural similarity through metal resistances or denitrification genes in brief the existence of these functional genera with the ability of vv reducing and resistant related genera implied the potential of three kinds of survival pathways to the vanadium stress the co occurrence patterns of microbial communities were performed by interactive network analyses based on the strong spearman r 0 850 and significant p 0 001 relationships typical modular configurations were observed in microbial community networks for both water figure s6a and sediment figure s6b samples with the modularity higher than 0 5 0 806 and 0 833 respectively most microorganisms in both water and sediment exhibited positive relationships table s1 among the co existing taxa proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in both water figure s6a accounting for 42 9 of the total nodes and sediment samples figure s6b accounting for 43 3 followed by actinobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi the sedimentary network possessed a higher average degree 21 6 than that for water 20 2 suggesting that sedimentary microbial community was more complex than that in water moreover the higher average clustering coefficient of the network for sediment samples 0 579 than water 0 568 indicated more tight associations among sedimentary microbes in addition six representative topological properties of networks including node number edge number average degree graph diameter graph density and betweenness centralization exhibited no significant difference between the polluted stream and jinsha river in water or sediment samples figure s7 overall the positive and modular interactions among individual microbial taxa were found in these vanadium influenced aquatic environments this potentially indicated cooperative associations within microbial taxa marcos et al 2019 and strong stability of microbial communities hernandez et al 2021 which helped microbes more tolerant to the stress imposed by vanadium chen et al 2022 moreover potential keystone taxa were also identified in co occurrence networks for both water table s2 and sediment table s3 intriguingly most potential keystone taxa could be involved in heavy metal resistance heavy metal reduction and nutrient metabolisms possibly suggesting their excellent capabilities in adapting to heavy metal contaminations and mediating fundamental biogeochemical processes particularly geobacter was identified as a keystone genus in water samples and also as a potential functional genus with the vanadium reducing ability table s2 fig 2 c as proved by previous studies keystone taxa play an important role in maintaining the stability of microbial community and mediating community response to multiple metal contaminations sun et al 2013 yang et al 2022 moreover keystone taxa also cooperatively interacted with other bacteria and these frequent cooperative interactions not only serve as the crucial parts for energy flowing and matter cycling but also contribute to the microbial communities surviving in this high vanadium stress environment 3 3 influence of vanadium on community structure rda was performed to explore the influence of physicochemical parameters on bacterial genera as shown in fig 3 a b rda1 and rda2 jointly explained 55 9 and 84 8 of the total variance of microbial communities in water and sediment respectively for bacteria in water vanadium fe zn ti and ph were identified as the important drivers for shaping the microbial community structure fig 3 a metals including ti zn and fe were close to the vanadium mainly because of the release from vanadium mining relevance activities for sedimentary microbes the contents of cr ap nh4 n vanadium and no3 n were the most important parameters in shifting the microbial communities fig 3 b almost all the parameters showed a positive correlation because they were almost distributed into the same quadrants zhang et al 2021c consistent with the previous findings zhang et al 2019 vanadium and its production related factors could shift the microbial community in both water and sediment sems were further conducted to quantify the direct and indirect effects of physicochemical factors on alpha diversity of microbial communities as a result vanadium content was found to indirectly affect the bacterial diversity in water fig 3 c while directly and indirectly influence bacterial diversity in sediment fig 3 d for microbes in aqueous medium considering standardized total influences the direct factors influencing the variance of bacterial diversity followed the order toc Î» 0 569 no3 n Î» 0 438 and nh4 n Î» 0 413 in addition vanadium exerted a significant positive direct effect Î» 0 812 p 0 001 on the content of nh4 n which positively influenced bacterial diversity through both direct and indirect ways the impacts of vanadium production on physicochemical parameters especially nutrients have been widely reported zhang et al 2019 yin et al 2022 as for the sedimentary bacteria the content of vanadium imposed a directly positive effect on both the abundance Î» 0 712 p 0 001 and diversity Î» 0 690 of microbial communities besides vanadium could indirectly affect bacterial abundance and diversity through other factors such as ph Î» 0 699 p 0 05 and om Î» 0 720 p 0 001 which were positively influenced by vanadium and indirectly determined microbial alpha diversity together with previous research in a heavy metal polluted environment xavier et al 2019 our findings suggested that vanadium played an indispensable role in affecting microbial community structure and the diversity under vanadium contamination with vanadium stress diverse survival strategies of microbial communities would be inspired thereby different community metabolic characteristics including regulation transportation resistance and metabolism would be genetically evolved to adapt to the changing surrounding environment xavier et al 2019 3 4 survival strategies of microbes to vanadium shotgun metagenomic analysis was performed to infer the survival strategies of the innate microbes especially the putative vrb by detecting the presence of vanadium related genes and pathways a total of 198 high quality mags with at least 70 completeness and less than 10 contamination were retrieved fig 4 a these mags were phylogenetically assigned to seventeen phyla among which proteobacteria actinobacteriota planctomycetota verrucomicrobiota and bacteroidota had predominant abundances in all samples respectively accounting for 26 9 18 0 4 29 2 05 and 1 19 of the total mags more importantly the vanadium adaption related genes were searched for each mag a total of eleven crucial functional genes previously confirmed to be responsible for three survival strategies of microorganisms under vanadium stress were identified in this polluted environment specifically denitrification genes included dissimilatory nitrate reductase narg antipov et al 2000 nitrate reductase gene napa he et al 2021 and nitrite reductase gene nirs zhang et al 2021a reported participating in vanadium reduction could be carried by 33 14 and 5 mags respectively besides outer membrane cytochrome genes omcab sun et al 2020 myers et al 2004 and glutathione reductase genes gsr ueki and adi 2019 as typical electron transfer genes catalyzing the vanadium reduction were found to be encoded by 3 14 and 56 mags respectively a total of 91 mags containing the mentioned denitrification genes or electron transfer genes were regarded as the putative vrb in addition vanadium resistance related genes including smta smtb czcd cnrb and chra promoting the adaptation of microbes to vanadium were also widely detected in 166 mags among these vanadium resistance genes chra cnrb and czcd were the most frequent genes and respectively identified in 113 89 and 73 mags intriguingly 25 mags were found to carry metabolic genes associated with denitrification electron transfer and vanadium resistance indicating the diverse and cooperative survival strategies of these microorganisms under the vanadium stress in this aquatic environment from the perspective of phylogenetic taxonomy of the 91 vrb figure s8a gsr napa and nirs were mainly carried by proteobacteria while omcb and narg were tightly associated with mags belonging to planctomycetota and actinobacteriota respectively at the genus level gsr in sedimentary mags was frequently possessed by pseudomonas aliihoeflea and sphingopyxis narg in water was carried by nocardioides janibacter and kocuria napa tended to be linked to pseudomonas and shinella figure s8b particularly these vrb might not only carry 1 3 kinds of vanadium reduction genes but also contain multiple vanadium resistance genes fig 4 a which promoted these vrbs to play a competitive advantage in vanadium polluted environments through reducing and tolerating vanadium actually in addition to the retrieved mags other unknown microorganisms without complete genomes could also show the ability to detoxify vanadium through vv reducing and resistance genes therefore we further evaluated the contribution of the three survival strategies to microbial communities in this system in terms of the distribution of the above 11 key functional genes in water and sediment habitats fig 4 b electron transfer genes exhibited a predominant abundance 691 coverage gb in water and 930 coverage gb in sediment higher than that of denitrification genes 219 in water and 85 7 in sediment and resistance genes 321 in water and 268 in sediment indicating the remarkable role of electron transfer genes in response to vanadium contamination especially omcb as the vanadium reduction genes 669 coverage gb followed by narg 214 and gsr 22 3 showed the highest abundance and mainly contributed to vanadium reduction in water and the same was true in sediments omcb 857 narg 215 gsr 72 9 the electron transfer process was reported to widely happen in the environment with abundant redox active metal minerals shi et al 2016 and this vanadium detoxification way could be the main contributor to microbial adaptation in this vanadium contaminated environment due to the frequent redox conversion during microbial metabolisms borch et al 2010 sosa 2018 in comparison the enzyme catalysis strategy based on denitrification genes requires abundant nitrate reductase which would limit their contribution to vanadium detoxication process in this aquatic ecosystem he et al 2021 in addition multiple heavy metal resistances of diverse microorganisms contribute to tolerating and defending the toxicity of metals especially vanadium thus maintaining the structure and function stability of the microbial community under contaminated conditions voica et al 2016 3 5 metabolic potentials of the putative vrb in order to evaluate the metabolic potentials of the putative vrb metabolic genes related to vv reduction and metal resistance accompanied with carbon metabolism nitrogen metabolism and sulfur metabolism were investigated for the acquired 91 mags fig 5 within the carbon mechanism pentose phosphate pathway non oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle tca and pentose phosphate pathway oxidative respectively identified in 63 45 and 44 mags were the most common carbon metabolism pathway however no complete pathway for the wood ljungdahl pathway hydroxypropionate hydroxybutylate cycle dicarboxylate hydroxybutyrate cycle and 3 hydroxypropionate bi cycle was identified in these mags the wood ljungdahl pathway was found to usually exist under anoxic conditions to reduce co2 or oxidize acetate to co2 and h2 jiao et al 2021 so it seldom occurred in this aquatic environment among six nitrogen metabolism modules genes related to dissimilatory nitrate reduction could be completely encoded by 19 mags especially the most abundant mag pseudomonas sp bin 105 in addition nitrogen fixation assimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification might be conducted by 4 4 and 3 mags respectively for sulfur metabolism all necessary genes involved in assimilatory sulfate reduction and thiosulfate oxidation by sox complex were found in 20 and 15 mags represented by williamsia sp bin 45 and paracoccus sp bin 172 respectively besides multiple genes conferring resistances to vanadium as cu ag and zn were widely detected in these potential vv reducing mags suggesting their superior capabilities for tolerating the toxicity of multiple heavy metals in this aquatic habitat therefore the diverse metabolism pathways of these functional mags could supply abundant carbon nitrogen as well as sulfur nutrients and develop metal resistance to help them stimulate adaptive strategies in such high vanadium stress condition kuang et al 2016 3 6 conceptual model of the survival strategies for putative vrb recognizing the genetic traits of vrb was of great significance for vanadium bioremediation in metal polluted sites sun et al 2020 however the current knowledge of the potential functional characteristics of vrb was far from satisfactory considering the increasing vanadium contamination here we proposed the conceptual metabolic model for the four representative vrb which had distinct vv reducing pathways and considerable abundances among all retrieved mags gene narg as a member of the dimethyl sulfoxide reductase molybdoenzymes family has been suggested to facilitate the vv reduction in vrb such as polaromonas sp sun et al 2020 in this study nocardioides sp bin 100 was characterized as the most abundant putative vrb that contained narg genes for vv reduction fig 6 a what s more this vrb was also involved in the process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium besides various electron donors such as organic matter inorganic matter and n related electron donors might contribute to the potential of the vv reduction process for this mag complete pathways for inorganic and organic respiration including glycolysis pathway tca cycle pentose phosphate pathway and pyruvate oxidation were also identified in this putative vrb typical abc transporters for organic compounds such as glycine betaine proline glucose and cellobiose were also found in addition no complete carbon fixation pathway was found suggesting its potential for heterotrophic growth in the aquatic environment moreover nocardioides was reported to carry a great abundance of copper resistance genes in a metal contaminated river xavier et al 2019 but identified with diverse metal resistance genes including arsb czcd zitb copc pcoc and znuabc in this aquatic system indicating its genetic potential to resist and excrete multiple heavy metals such as vanadium as co zn and cd in summary nocardioides was first confirmed to have a potential ability of detoxifying and resisting vanadium and this dominant putative vrb also played a crucial role in the survival of microbial communities in this vanadium contaminated system pathways based on intracellular nitrite reductase encoded by gene nirs or nitrate reductase encoded by gene napa had been proposed as the main route for vv reduction by vrb such as lactococcus raffinolactis zhang et al 2021a shi et al 2021 compared with nirs dominated in heterotrophic bioprocesses the gene napa showed a prominent abundance in autotrophic biosystems wang et al 2020b in this study the co occurrence of nirs and napa was frequently detected in azohydromonas sp bin 8 dechloromonas sp bin 15 and skermanella sp bin 24 among them dechloromonas sp bin 15 as the predominant putative vrb fig 6 b could involve in complete dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification processes meanwhile electron donors were also identified such as those from nadh and organic respiration including glycolysis pathway tca cycle pentose phosphate pathway and pyruvate oxidation specifically complete genes associated with the calvin cycle were also found in dechloromonas sp bin 15 indicating their potential for autotrophic growth by employing carbon oxide for synthesizing the cellular materials similar to the previous findings on dechloromonas lin et al 2021 multiple metal resistance genes such as arscr czcabc zitb afuabc cusabr cbib znub and modabc encoded by this versatile vrb would also be helpful for its adaption to vanadium polluted environments notably two putative pathways respectively catalyzed by napa and gsr possibly participated in the reduction of vv in pseudomonas sp bin 105 fig 6 c indicating that this vrb could be a mixotroph that can use both organic and inorganic compounds as electron donors similar with the previous findings on polaromonas spp sun et al 2020 carbohydrate metabolism including the tca cycle pentose phosphate pathway and pyruvate oxidation could be completely performed by this vrb no complete carbon fixation was identified in this mag possibly reflecting its potential for heterotrophic growth particularly this species could have the ability for dissimilatory nitrate reduction and resistance to diverse metals such as vanadium as cu and cd thereby facilitating the detoxification process and its flourishing in harsh vanadium environments in addition pseudomonas was also found to be widely present in other environments with elevated vanadium including soils wang et al 2020a sediments san martÃ­n et al 2021 wastewater lyalkova and yurkova 1992 and bioreactors qiu et al 2017 liu et al 2017 2022 previous studies suggested that the tetraheme cytochrome cyma and the outer membrane cytochrome omcab for vv reduction have been widely reported in shewanella oneidensis myers et al 2004 and polaromonas sp sun et al 2020 during the vv reduction process cyma is identified as the electron transfer intermediate between the quinone quinol pool of the inner membrane and the terminal reductases while omcab as a metal reductase can bind and reduce vanadium however the co occurrence of cyma and omcab genes was not present in any mag obtained in this study and only omcab could be encoded by 18 mags probably suggesting the existence of other electron transfer intermediates such as nadh or organics regarding the strategy based on electron transfer genes omcab for vv reduction uba9464 sp bin 118 as the most abundant vrb encoded omcb was explored considering its potential metabolic characteristics fig 6 d despite the incomplete pathway for carbon fixation complete genes cluster for assimilatory nitrate reduction and nadh as well as resistance genes related with vanadium as cu ag and zn were identified in this mag which could play essential roles in nutrient acquisition energy production and ecological adaption of this heterotrophic vrb in vanadium contamination in brief most of these representative vrb were first identified to possess vanadium reduction and resistant functions through different functional genes which helped them to form various survival strategies to flourish in harsh vanadium environments more importantly these representative putative vrb also have additional environmental functions besides vanadium detoxification specifically nocardioides sp as the most abundant vrb mag was also observed to carry on diverse metal resistance genes including arsb czcd zitb copc pcoc and znuabc promoting its resistance to multiple heavy metals such as vanadium as co zn and cd nocardioides was also reported to degrade micropollutants from the wastewater zhao et al 2021 indicating that the xenobiotics biodegradation potential could be helpful for this putative vrb in adapting to this organic and metal contaminated environment besides dechloromonas sp was found to involve in complete dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification processes due to the presence of relevant nitrogen transformation genes implying its contribution to the nitrogen cycle in this aquatic system dechloromonas with various metal resistance genes was also identified to be dominant under other heavy metal contaminated systems benefiting from its advantages in utilizing energy eliminating radicals and also repairing the damaged cell lin et al 2021 pseudomonas has been reported to not only participate in the vanadium reduction but also fix nitrogen and reduce or resist transition metals fakhar et al 2022 suyal et al 2014 collectively as the key members of the microbial community in this complex environment these putative vrb not only have the ability to detoxify vanadium and resist metals but also exhibited prominent potential in stress adaptation energy flowing and nutrient conversion 4 conclusions this study provides important insights for understanding the response of microbial communities to vanadium in natural aquatic environments high vanadium content played a critical role in shaping the community structure as deciphered by rda and sems analyses meanwhile microorganisms tended to exhibit cooperative interactions in response to vanadium stress furthermore metagenomic technology identified the presence of the three main survival strategies in this vanadium contaminated riverine habitat specifically putative vrb could reduce vanadium via enzyme catalysis or electron transfer and tolerate vanadium through metal resistance process and we proposed that nocardioides sp dechloromonas sp and pseudomonas sp were the representative bacteria significantly contributing to vanadium reduction and resistance in this biosystem besides metabolic potentials of certain new vrb were also shed light on which would be of important guidance for the isolation and application of vrb in the vv bioremediation process overall our study provided fully integrated knowledge of microbial response to vanadium which would be of great significance to developing better strategies for future

15783,exposure models are useful tools for relating environmental monitoring data to expected health outcomes the objective of this study was to 1 compare two legionella shower exposure models and 2 develop a risk calculator tool for relating environmental monitoring data to estimated legionella infection risks and legionnaires disease ld illness risks legionella infection risks for a single shower event were compared using two shower legionella exposure models these models varied in their description of partitioning of legionella in aerosols and aerosol deposition in the lung where model 1 had larger and fewer aerosol ranges than model 2 model 2 described conventional vs water efficient showers separately while model 1 described exposure for an unspecified shower type did not describe it as conventional or water efficient a monte carlo approach was used to account for variability and uncertainty in these aerosolization and deposition parameters legionella concentrations and the dose response parameter methods for relating infection risks to illness risks accounting for demographic differences were used to inform the risk calculator web application app model 2 consistently estimated higher infection risks than model 1 for the same legionella concentration in water and estimated deposited doses with less variability for a 7 8 min shower with a legionella concentration of 0 1 cfu ml the average infection risks estimated using model 2 were 4 8 10 6 sd 3 0 10 6 conventional shower and 2 3 10 6 sd 1 7 10 6 water efficient average infection risk estimated by model 1 was 1 1 10 6 sd 9 7 10 7 model 2 was used for app development due to more conservative risk estimates and less variability in estimated dose while multiple legionella shower models are available for quantitative microbial risk assessments qmras they may yield notably different infection risks for the same environmental microbial concentration model comparisons will inform decisions regarding their integration with risk assessment tools the development of risk calculator tools for relating environmental microbiology data to infection risks will increase the impact of exposure models for informing water treatment decisions and achieving risk targets graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords qmra legionnaires disease building water management web application data availability code can be accessed at https github com awilson12 legionella models 1 introduction 1 1 legionella disease burden and the role of the environment legionella species cause pontiac fever and a more severe illness known as legionnaires disease ld according to the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc cases of ld have increased in the u s nearly nine fold since 2000 and there were almost 10 000 reported cases in the us in 2018 centers for disease control and prevention 2018 this increase could be due to a myriad of factors including increased testing population susceptibility and greater prevalence of legionella in the environment despite alarming increases in ld cases 90 of outbreaks may be preventable via water safety management programs centers for disease control and prevention 2016 of legionella spp that cause infection most infections are attributable to legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 sg1 yu et al 2002 in an international survey of community acquired legionellosis cases that were confirmed using culture based methods 91 5 465 508 were attributable to l pneumophila and of these 92 428 465 were of sg1 yu et al 2002 more recently amemura maekawa et al 2018 found that 98 419 427 of legionellosis patient isolates of legionella spp from the legionella reference center in japan were l pneumophila specifically amemura maekawa et al 2018 during an outbreak in the u s at an 89 bed acute care hospital all cases were of l pneumophila sg1 infections hanrahan et al 1987 in conjunction with this outbreak investigation 13 of 38 hospital water system samples were positive for l pneumophila sg1 including showers showerheads and a hot water tank hanrahan et al 1987 it should be noted that the widely used urinary antigen diagnostic test does not readily detect non sg1 l pneumophila possibly resulting in testing bias for studies that implement this method byrne et al 2018 several legionellosis epidemiological studies support a relationship between l pneumophila presence in potable water in hospital buildings and nosocomial cases one of the first studies exploring epidemiological evidence of l pneumophila in hospitals and associated legionellosis cases reported that l pneumophila was detected in potable water of 30 3 10 of sampled sites best et al 1983 while this suggested a relationship between l pneumophila in potable water and infection risk it also suggested that concentrations below detectable limits could still result in exposures posing meaningful infection risks the health burden and cost of l pneumophila make it an important focus of current healthcare associated infection research in a cdc report of outbreaks of waterborne disease from 2011 to 2012 15 of 18 total outbreaks were of legionellosis beer et al 2015 of 10 deaths resulting from these outbreaks five were associated with healthcare environments unspecified healthcare facilities hospitals and long term care facilities beer et al 2015 from 2013 to 2014 63 17 27 of waterborne disease outbreaks were attributable to legionella spp mcclung et al 2017 collier et al 2012 estimated each episode of ld of inpatient medicare supplemental hospitalized cases and of commercial hospitalized cases to cost 26 741 and 38 363 respectively collier et al 2012 the high burden and cost of these outbreaks some of which are preventable necessitates development and implementation of risk mitigation strategies 1 2 mitigation strategies to mitigate legionella spp exposures and consequential infection risks legionella spp water management programs are now an industry standard for large buildings such as hospitals long term care hotels resorts and other large facilities with a high density of people and in 2018 a memo was published by the centers for medicare medicaid services cms describing facility requirements to develop and adhere to policies and procedures that inhibit microbial growth in building water systems in order to reduce legionella risks centers for medicare and medicaid services 2018 standard 188 2021 was published by the american national standards institute ansi and the american society of heating refrigerating and air conditioning engineers ashrae legionellosis risk management for building water systems providing information on compliance ansi ashrae standard 188 2018 2018 legionellosis risk management for building water systems 2021 these programs include developing a management plan and ensuring the plan is effective one means to make the plan effective is through routine environmental sampling centers for disease control and prevention n d with increased environmental monitoring efforts there is a growing need for guidance in interpreting monitoring results through a risk based lens especially interpretation of legionella concentrations that fall below the limit of detection risk targets or goals to protect exposed individuals at specific risk levels have been used in other microbial water quality contexts where quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra was used to inform intervention and monitoring strategies for drinking water to meet a 1 10 000 annual infection risk target macler and regli 1993 signor and ashbolt 2009 more recently advanced microbial risk assessment tools have been used to quantitatively ascribe the degree of infection risk associated with water aerosol generating features including faucets toilets showers outdoor spray irrigation systems and cooling towers hamilton et al 2018 2019 pepper and gerba 2018 schoen and ashbolt 2011 these studies provide mechanistic insights into legionella spp exposure events that quantitatively relate a specific concentration of l pneumophila this specific species since this is what the dose response curve data is fit to armstrong and haas 2007 to infection risk however risk assessment models are often difficult to implement into practice this has been improved by efforts to build web applications of qmra models so that those without modeling or coding expertise can apply these models for decision making or risk management strategy crank et al 2019 rocha melogno et al 2022 the extension of these models for risk based tool development will increase their potential impact for guiding monitoring and intervention strategies for achieving risk thresholds 1 3 study objective to develop such a tool more information is needed regarding the existing exposure models hamilton et al 2019 schoen and ashbolt 2011 and how they compare in their estimates of infection risk therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 compare infection risks from showers estimated by two model frameworks 2 explore reasons for discrepancies between risk estimates and 3 demonstrate proof of concept for a l pneumophila risk app to be used by facilities managers in water management programs 2 methods a simple exposure scenario describing a single showering event was used to compare two shower risk assessment models in their infection risk estimates the estimated illness and infection risks for the schoen and ashbolt 2011 model 1 and hamilton et al 2019 model 2 models were compared using the same l pneumophila concentrations in the water and shower durations a monte carlo approach was used to account for variability and uncertainty in parameters describing aerosolization of l pneumophila inhalation rates and the fractions of aerosols depositing in the alveolar region of the lung ten thousand iterations were used supported by burmaster and anderson 1994 and central tendencies of infection risk were reasonably stable with this number of iterations burmaster and anderson 1994 to conduct a sensitivity analysis spearman correlation coefficients were used to quantify monotonic relationships between input parameters and infection risks for both models where a larger absolute value of a spearman correlation coefficient indicated a stronger influence of the input parameter on the output infection risk spearman correlation coefficients are also appropriate for nonparametric data 2 1 model 1 for estimating dose and infection risk in model 1 the concentration of l pneumophila in the air cfu m3 is a function of the concentration in the water cfu l and a partitioning coefficient cfu m3 cfu l eq 1 schoen and ashbolt 2011 1 c a i r p c c w a t e r a partitioning coefficient was randomly sampled from a triangular distribution minimum 1 10 5 mode 1 10 4 maximum 1 9 10 4 informed by the low value and the best estimate value listed by schoen and asbolt 2011 to estimate the volume of air inhaled an inhalation rate m3 hr b was multiplied by the duration of the exposure an inhalation rate was randomly sampled from a normal distribution mean 1 2 10 2 sd 2 5 10 3 left truncated at zero m3 min informed by the u s environmental protection agency s exposure factors handbook u s environmental protection agency 2011 2 v a i r b t to estimate how the concentration of l pneumophila in the air and the volume of air inhaled relate to dose the fractions of aerosolized l pneumophila in the aerosol size range of 1 5 Î¼m and the fraction of aerosols that reach the alveoli were multiplied by the concentration and volume inhaled while the original model addresses other size ranges 5 6 Î¼m and 6 10 Î¼m there is evidence that particles 5 microns primarily deposit in upper and larger airways of the lung darquenne 2020 and will not remain airborne for as long as particles less than 5 Î¼m fennelly 2020 in terms of other size ranges and deposition in the lung 2 5 Î¼m mostly deposits in the central and small airways and 2 Î¼m in the alveolar region darquenne 2020 although we were interested in deposition in the alveolar region we used 5 Î¼m a cut off since this is the upper limit of the smaller range of particles explored in the original schoen and ashbolt model 1 5 Î¼m for which there are parameterized distributions schoen andand ashbolt 2011 it should be noted that not all aerosols in the size range of 1 5 Î¼m in this model were assumed to deposit in the alveolar region of the lung the fraction of total aerosols 1 5 Î¼m assumed to deposit in the alveolar region was randomly sampled from a triangular distribution minimum 0 midpoint 0 2 maximum 0 54 the percent of 1 5 Âµm range aerosols containing legionella was then randomly sampled from a uniform distribution with a minimum of 75 and a maximum of 100 the dose was then inputted into an exponential dose response curve with parameter k the probability that a single organism survives and arrives at the infection site this dose response curve with an infection endpoint was used in the original work from model 2 hamilton et al 2019 informed by a dose response study of guinea pig data originating from inhalation exposures armstrong and haas 2007 muller et al 1983 no dose response curve was originally used in the development of model 1 as risk was not a main output in that work schoen and ashbolt 2011 therefore the same dose response curve was used in models 1 and 2 3 1 d o s e p c c w a t e r b t f 1 f 2 3 2 d o s e c a i r v a i r f 1 f 2 4 p i n f e c t i o n 1 e k d o s e variables and their distributions can be seen in table 1 the partitioning coefficient values p c and the fraction of l pneumophila in aerosols in size range 1 5 f 1 originate from experimental data in a hospital setting perkins et al 2009 the fraction of aerosols in size range 1 5 that are then assumed to deposit in the lung originate from a chapter of concepts in inhalation toxicology schlesinger 1989 2 2 model 2 for estimating dose and infection risk using model 2 the dose was estimated by multiplying the l pneumophila concentration in the water at the fixture c w a t e r by the breathing rate b duration of exposure t a sum of concentrations of aerosols c a e r i of specific diameter sizes i by their volume sizes v a e r i and a sum of the fraction of l pneumophila in the aerosols of specific sizes f i and the deposition efficiency d i of aerosols of those sizes hamilton et al 2019 the range of aerosol sizes explored here was from 1 to 5 Âµm to be consistent with model 1 and due to mechanistic reasons described above even though larger size ranges are explored in the original work hamilton et al 2019 parameters and their distributions and sources can be seen in table 1 5 d o s e c w a t e r

from experimental studies o toole et al 2008 2009 the fraction of aerosols with diameter i Âµm containing l pneumophila f i and the fraction of aerosols of that size that would then deposit in the lung d i were also informed by experimental data and allegra et al 2016 heyder et al 1986 2 3 relating infection risks to illness risks methodology described by weir et al 2020 was used to relate infection to illness risks weir et al 2020 however it should be noted that individual infection risks per group were not calculated and combined as done by weir et al 2020 rather we directly estimate a population level risk briefly the probability of illness p i l l n e s s was estimated by multiplying the overall population as opposed to stratified by age or sex probability of infection by morbidity ratio proxy m r g for a specific group eq 6 weir et al 2020 6 p i l l n e s s g p i n f e c t i o n m r g the morbidity ratio is estimated by multiplying a national attack rate a r by the ratio of the incidence in a specific group i r g to that of the total population i r p eq 7 7 m r g a r i r g i r p in this study the groups included 8 age ranges males and females 4 races and 2 ethnicity categories based on available incidence data while not measured in this study it should be noted that differences in incidence across race and ethnicity may be due to a myriad of factors including social determinants of health associated with increased legionnaires disease risk e g household income living in older homes or rental properties and higher incidence of legionnaires disease among black or african american individuals relative to white individuals has been reported in other studies barskey et al 2022 in a report of 2016 2017 data deven et al 2020 the cdc reported a national incidence rate of 2 29 100 000 in 2017 which we used to inform i r p to our knowledge a more recent cdc report providing a national incidence rate is not available an estimated national attack rate of 0 05 was used as this has been suggested by weir et al 2020 as a potential value for a r available from osha occupational safety and health administration n d weir et al 2020 since a wide range of inhalation rates representative for males and females of age ranges overlapping with the ranges here it was assumed that the estimated p i n f e c t i o n was representative of an overall population risk weir et al 2020 2 4 comparing deposited doses based on airborne concentrations we hypothesized the driver of differences between the two models would be in how partitioning is handled where in model 1 a ratio for partitioning of all sizes is used however model 2 involves the use of size specific partitioning coefficients to explore how similarly they described deposition of aerosols in the lung specifically we assumed the same concentration of bacteria in the air and updated the models to only describe deposition of aerosols data from allegra et al 2020 were used to inform input parameters for models 1 and 2 allegra et al 2020 hamilton et al 2019 schoen and ashbolt 2011 these parameters included the concentration of legionella in the air that was experimentally measured using a simulated shower setup 2 9 103 bacteria m3 and the inhalation rate 7 5 m3 min allegra et al 2020 because the concentration of air was used as an input as opposed to the concentration in the water eq 1 for model 1 was not used for model comparison for model 2 eq 5 was altered where the concentration of legionella in the air was assumed to be equal to the product of the concentration of legionella in the water c w a t e r and the summation of the number of aerosols of size i per cubic meter of air multiplied by the volume of the aerosol of size i note that this means estimated deposited doses would be the same for conventional and water efficient showers 2 5 app development an interactive app was developed with rshiny where flexible input parameters included log10 cfu ml of legionella in shower water shower duration min risk threshold shower type conventional vs water efficient age and sex age and sex specific inhalation rates were used to result in age and sex specific infection risk estimates the app was then designed to output infection risks estimated over a range of legionella concentrations for the same scenario shower duration shower type age and sex with a point on the lines indicating the estimated mean infection risk for the specific scenario a heatmap of illness risks in the form of cases 100 000 estimated for showers of this duration shower type and with the selected legionella concentration were also outputted for both males and females of ages 55 64 yrs 65 74 yrs 75 84 yrs and 85 yrs stratified by race white african american black asian pacific islander native american illnesses were not estimated for groups with less than 16 cases for informing incidence rates these groups included native american men or women asian pacific islander women and asian pacific islander men ages 75 84 years or 85 table 2 3 results 3 1 infection risks infection risks for conventional showers estimated with model 2 were greatest followed by infection risks for water efficient showers also estimated with model 2 and lastly by infection risk estimates using model 1 fig 1 greater variability was seen for infection risk estimates using model 1 in comparison to model 2 fig 1 these differences in infection risk translated to differences in legionella concentrations that yielded a greater than 1 10 000 infection risk per shower event it should be noted that the 1 10 000 is an annual risk target not originally used to be a target per exposure world health organization 2004 however this threshold and similar ones 5 10 000 have been used in other non water related qmra contexts as a threshold for comparison for exposure specific events harvey et al 2021 wilson et al 2021 while model 1 estimated infection risks straddling a 1 10 000 risk target for a legionella concentration of 10 cfu ml this risk threshold was already surpassed for model 2 for a 7 8 min shower with a legionella concentration of 0 1 cfu ml a concentration and shower duration used by hamilton et al 2019 the average infection risk for conventional showers was 4 8 10 6 sd 3 0 10 6 fig 2 water efficient showers corresponded to an average infection risk of 2 3 10 6 sd 1 7 10 6 and unspecified showers showers from the schoen and ashbolt model that do not specify water efficient vs conventional using model 1 corresponded to an average infection risk of 1 1 10 6 sd 9 7 10 7 fig 2 3 2 comparison of deposited doses for same airborne concentration when models 1 and 2 were used to estimate deposition of legionella in the lungs assuming the same concentration of airborne legionella and disregarding differences in partitioning the central tendencies of estimated deposited doses were similar where the mean estimated doses for models 1 and 2 were 4 0 cfu and 5 2 cfu respectively fig 3 however when these distributions were compared with a wilcoxon rank sum test they were statistically significantly different w 26774006 p 0 001 it should be noted that this was a comparison of 10 000 iterations for each model and that a p value is a function of sample size aside from the statistical implications the overall similarity in magnitude of estimated deposited doses demonstrated that differences in infection risk between the models are likely driven by differences in describing partitioning as opposed to deposited dose more variability in estimated dose was seen for model 1 than for model 2 we therefore used model 2 for app development 3 3 sensitivity analysis of the parameters used to inform deposited dose the factors with the greatest influence on infection risk for model 1 were the dose response curve parameter k 0 54 the partitioning coefficient 0 47 and the fraction of aerosols of sizes 1 5 Î¼m that deposit in the alveolar region of the lung 0 58 fig s1 for model 2 the most influential factor in both the conventional and water efficient fixture models was the dose response curve parameter k 0 82 for conventional and 0 76 for water efficient followed by the inhalation rate b 0 36 for conventional and 0 33 for water efficient fig s1 this may be due in part to smaller ranges of aerosol sizes where no one size drives infection risk fig s1 3 4 app development due to more conservative risk estimates figs 1 and 2 and more refined aerosol size ranges table 1 we utilized the model 2 for risk calculator application development the calculator inputs included legionella concentrations of log10 cfu ml shower duration min risk thresholds 1 1 000 to 1 1 000 000 varying by a power of ten conventional vs water efficient showers age years from 11 to 81 and the sex of the person taking the shower male or female fig 4 infection risk estimates based on inhalation rates for the age and sex selected informed by the u s exposure factors handbook were then used to estimate infection risks for a range of legionella concentrations and the mean infection risk for the selected scenario was plotted fig 4 u s environmental protection agency 2011 if this risk was above the selected risk threshold indicated by a dotted line then the diamond was colored red as opposed to green when it was below the risk threshold this allows for a fast interpretation of the infection risk for the scenario relative to the selected risk threshold illness risks were then plotted below where a population level infection risk not specific to age or sex was used in conjunction with case data table 2 to estimate illness risks ld specifically for men and women of various age ranges and races for a shower with the selected duration and legionella concentration fig 4 a disclaimer was added to the app to communicate its scope of use the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra models are developed from peer reviewed publications and risk factors for legionnaires disease these models are not intended for commercial use or purposes methods used for legionella enumeration may underestimate or overestimate risk 4 discussion two mechanistic models were compared in their estimation of legionella exposures and subsequent infection risks during showering events model 2 which divides aerosols into smaller bin sizes than model 1 for describing partitioning and deposition into the lung produces more conservative risk estimates where average risks for the conventional and water efficient showers were 4 and 2 times greater than risks estimated using model 1 for a shower of the same duration and legionella concentration fig 2 model 2 was utilized in development of the risk calculator tool because it resulted in more conservative risk estimates figs 1 and 2 and was composed of more detailed aerosol size parameters in development of a risk calculator tool table 1 translation of risk assessment tools for interpreting environmental monitoring data is an important development for increasing the impact of mechanistic models for comparing anticipated health outcomes based on environmental conditions and relating these environmental monitoring data to risk threshold goals this study facilitates interpretation of l pneumophila culture monitoring results in infection risk terms the model developed by hamilton et al 2019 in the form of an interactive app will help building owners and operators determine risks of legionella infection and inform decisions on changes that may be required in their water safety management program while traditional culture methods are more typically used for environmental surveillance it is recognized that some facilities use molecular methods for verifying the effectiveness of their water safety management program molecular methods may be favored due to faster results and greater sensitivity one limitation of this method however is that not all detected genome copies represent live l pneumophila for example ditommaso et al 2015 found that the mean log difference between the amount of legionella detected with culture and with qpcr was 1 45 standard deviation 0 24 or qpcr concentrations were approximately 28 times greater than those of culture ditommaso et al 2015 because these were artificial samples more research is needed elucidating ratios of legionella detected with molecular methods and culture methods in real world samples integrating model 2 with the approach developed by weir et al 2020 for relating infection risks to demographically specific illness risks using legionella case data further extends the potential for a risk calculator tool to inform not only risk targets but also to evaluate risks for the most vulnerable populations gleason et al 2017 previously the method developed by weir et al 2020 could only be applied to one demographic variable at one time due to available data not including intersections of these demographic groups using data provided by the cdc in this study we were able to explore intersections of race age and sex as they relate to ld however even with this advancement in available data a current limitation is a lack of legionella case data especially for specific racial groups such as native american individuals making illness estimates potentially unreliable it should be noted that the use of population level health data is limited in that it does not necessarily capture risk of illness for immunocompromised individuals therefore application of this type of tool in environments with immunocompromised individuals such as in healthcare could underestimate risks and should be done with caution a tool such as this may be more useful for large facilities that serve less susceptible populations such as commercial buildings e g hotels or conference centers or institutional e g university dormitories that contain single showers additionally this tool would be more valuable if we had data to inform ld and pontiac fever risks when developing qmra or risk based tools it is important to consider how estimated risk outputs will be interpreted or influence future behavior or potential policies for example while the model we used to develop the tool in this work includes a 95 confidence interval the interpretation of this interval could vary if the model accurately captures reality and the distributions adequately capture variability and uncertainty the 95 confidence interval could communicate the certainty in the risk estimate if there is uncertainty about whether the model captures reality or if the distributions capture uncertainty and variability accurately the 95 confidence interval may only provide information regarding confidence about where the central tendency of the model output truly lies additionally studies of the perception of uncertainty in risk contexts suggests that communicating uncertainty as a numerical range vs with a visual depiction can influence risk perceptions or perceptions of the quality or accuracy of the risk assessment johnson and slovic 1995 van der bles et al 2019 considering that the purposes of qmra or health risk based tools are generally 1 so that risk models are accessible to non experts and 2 so risk models can be applied to protect human health with real world influences on health outcomes effective communication of risk outputs is paramount following the development of a tool surveys focus groups interviews and other methods are useful for determining the tool s interpretability and risk perceptions associated with its output therefore before the official version of this tool would be released more data will be needed regarding usability and interpretability of the tool in water management contexts and development of a user manual designed to address common questions or misconceptions future development efforts to progress the utilization of risk assessment tools for legionella to improve water safety plans or management strategies are warranted leveraging both legionella spp sampling results with technical based information regarding potential risk and illness can improve upon existing water quality guidance values for legionella spp currently being used by building water quality managers this combination can help advance concentration limit recommendations or criteria that may be based on judgment alone more so research to further single point of use qmra models to estimate facility level legionella risks would help give building water quality managers better decision making abilities for general water safety management such as water flushing or business re openings following pandemic related shutdowns public areas where consumers and tourists frequently visit may also experience increased risks of legionellosis with increasing temperature relative humidity and precipitation de giglio et al 2019 fisman et al 2005 the favorability of environments for legionella growth is influenced by sunlight intensity rainfall and water temperature beautÃ© et al 2016 walker 2018 climate change and the potential for increased legionellosis risks highlight the need for education and awareness of exposure risks for everyday water activities walker 2018 accessible dissemination of risk based knowledge is imperative for increasing public awareness and thereby protecting public health further development of user friendly and digestible risk based tools is an underutilized approach for addressing the increased need for interpretation of environmental monitoring results and understanding how behavior related parameters such as shower duration and demographic variables influence risk more data to inform these models especially human behavior data population specific risk factors and temporal and spatial variability of legionella concentrations at points of use will be useful for increasing the reliability of risk modeling tools additionally while a 1 10 000 threshold is used in this study as a point of comparison for individual risks as opposed to its use in drinking water as an annual risk threshold acceptable risk thresholds may vary by context and community more efforts are needed to characterize communities acceptable risks so these may drive concentration thresholds and health in built environments 5 conclusion this research adds to the body of knowledge demonstrating the value of qmra in legionella risk assessment we recognize the limitations of the model as not all strains of legionella spp are equally infective and pathogenic however this qmra model will help inform building owners and operators of three important principles 1 understand the value in enumerating legionella in their premise plumbing system 2 recognize that lower legionella counts reduce infection risk and 3 zero risk is not achievable a standard assumption in qmra models but actions taken as part of a water management program can reduce risk by factors of 10 fold or more assuming a 10 fold reduction in concentration relates to a 10 fold reduction in risk authors contributions all authors contributed to the

15783,exposure models are useful tools for relating environmental monitoring data to expected health outcomes the objective of this study was to 1 compare two legionella shower exposure models and 2 develop a risk calculator tool for relating environmental monitoring data to estimated legionella infection risks and legionnaires disease ld illness risks legionella infection risks for a single shower event were compared using two shower legionella exposure models these models varied in their description of partitioning of legionella in aerosols and aerosol deposition in the lung where model 1 had larger and fewer aerosol ranges than model 2 model 2 described conventional vs water efficient showers separately while model 1 described exposure for an unspecified shower type did not describe it as conventional or water efficient a monte carlo approach was used to account for variability and uncertainty in these aerosolization and deposition parameters legionella concentrations and the dose response parameter methods for relating infection risks to illness risks accounting for demographic differences were used to inform the risk calculator web application app model 2 consistently estimated higher infection risks than model 1 for the same legionella concentration in water and estimated deposited doses with less variability for a 7 8 min shower with a legionella concentration of 0 1 cfu ml the average infection risks estimated using model 2 were 4 8 10 6 sd 3 0 10 6 conventional shower and 2 3 10 6 sd 1 7 10 6 water efficient average infection risk estimated by model 1 was 1 1 10 6 sd 9 7 10 7 model 2 was used for app development due to more conservative risk estimates and less variability in estimated dose while multiple legionella shower models are available for quantitative microbial risk assessments qmras they may yield notably different infection risks for the same environmental microbial concentration model comparisons will inform decisions regarding their integration with risk assessment tools the development of risk calculator tools for relating environmental microbiology data to infection risks will increase the impact of exposure models for

and a more severe illness known as legionnaires disease ld according to the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc cases of ld have increased in the u s nearly nine fold since 2000 and there were almost 10 000 reported cases in the us in 2018 centers for disease control and prevention 2018 this increase could be due to a myriad of factors including increased testing population susceptibility and greater prevalence of legionella in the environment despite alarming increases in ld cases 90 of outbreaks may be preventable via water safety management programs centers for disease control and prevention 2016 of legionella spp that cause infection most infections are attributable to legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 sg1 yu et al 2002 in an international survey of community acquired legionellosis cases that were confirmed using culture based methods 91 5 465 508 were attributable to l pneumophila and of these 92 428 465 were of sg1 yu et al 2002 more recently amemura maekawa et al 2018 found that 98 419 427 of legionellosis patient isolates of legionella spp from the legionella reference center in japan were l pneumophila specifically amemura maekawa et al 2018 during an outbreak in the u s at an 89 bed acute care hospital all cases were of l pneumophila sg1 infections hanrahan et al 1987 in conjunction with this outbreak investigation 13 of 38 hospital water system samples were positive for l pneumophila sg1 including showers showerheads and a hot water tank hanrahan et al 1987 it should be noted that the widely used urinary antigen diagnostic test does not readily detect non sg1 l pneumophila possibly resulting in testing bias for studies that implement this method byrne et al 2018 several legionellosis epidemiological studies support a relationship between l pneumophila presence in potable water in hospital buildings and nosocomial cases one of the first studies exploring epidemiological evidence of l pneumophila in hospitals and associated legionellosis cases reported that l pneumophila was detected in potable water of 30 3 10 of sampled sites best et al 1983 while this suggested a relationship between l pneumophila in potable water and infection risk it also suggested that concentrations below detectable limits could still result in exposures posing meaningful infection risks the health burden and cost of l pneumophila make it an important focus of current healthcare associated infection research in a cdc report of outbreaks of waterborne disease from 2011 to 2012 15 of 18 total outbreaks were of legionellosis beer et al 2015 of 10 deaths resulting from these outbreaks five were associated with healthcare environments unspecified healthcare facilities hospitals and long term care facilities beer et al 2015 from 2013 to 2014 63 17 27 of waterborne disease outbreaks were attributable to legionella spp mcclung et al 2017 collier et al 2012 estimated each episode of ld of inpatient medicare supplemental hospitalized cases and of commercial hospitalized cases to cost 26 741 and 38 363 respectively collier et al 2012 the high burden and cost of these outbreaks some of which are preventable necessitates development and implementation of risk mitigation strategies 1 2 mitigation strategies to mitigate legionella spp exposures and consequential infection risks legionella spp water management programs are now an industry standard for large buildings such as hospitals long term care hotels resorts and other large facilities with a high density of people and in 2018 a memo was published by the centers for medicare medicaid services cms describing facility requirements to develop and adhere to policies and procedures that inhibit microbial growth in building water systems in order to reduce legionella risks centers for medicare and medicaid services 2018 standard 188 2021 was published by the american national standards institute ansi and the american society of heating refrigerating and air conditioning engineers ashrae legionellosis risk management for building water systems providing information on compliance ansi ashrae standard 188 2018 2018 legionellosis risk management for building water systems 2021 these programs include developing a management plan and ensuring the plan is effective one means to make the plan effective is through routine environmental sampling centers for disease control and prevention n d with increased environmental monitoring efforts there is a growing need for guidance in interpreting monitoring results through a risk based lens especially interpretation of legionella concentrations that fall below the limit of detection risk targets or goals to protect exposed individuals at specific risk levels have been used in other microbial water quality contexts where quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra was used to inform intervention and monitoring strategies for drinking water to meet a 1 10 000 annual infection risk target macler and regli 1993 signor and ashbolt 2009 more recently advanced microbial risk assessment tools have been used to quantitatively ascribe the degree of infection risk associated with water aerosol generating features including faucets toilets showers outdoor spray irrigation systems and cooling towers hamilton et al 2018 2019 pepper and gerba 2018 schoen and ashbolt 2011 these studies provide mechanistic insights into legionella spp exposure events that quantitatively relate a specific concentration of l pneumophila this specific species since this is what the dose response curve data is fit to armstrong and haas 2007 to infection risk however risk assessment models are often difficult to implement into practice this has been improved by efforts to build web applications of qmra models so that those without modeling or coding expertise can apply these models for decision making or risk management strategy crank et al 2019 rocha melogno et al 2022 the extension of these models for risk based tool development will increase their potential impact for guiding monitoring and intervention strategies for achieving risk thresholds 1 3 study objective to develop such a tool more information is needed regarding the existing exposure models hamilton et al 2019 schoen and ashbolt 2011 and how they compare in their estimates of infection risk therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 compare infection risks from showers estimated by two model frameworks 2 explore reasons for discrepancies between risk estimates and 3 demonstrate proof of concept for a l pneumophila risk app to be used by facilities managers in water management programs 2 methods a simple exposure scenario describing a single showering event was used to compare two shower risk assessment models in their infection risk estimates the estimated illness and infection risks for the schoen and ashbolt 2011 model 1 and hamilton et al 2019 model 2 models were compared using the same l pneumophila concentrations in the water and shower durations a monte carlo approach was used to account for variability and uncertainty in parameters describing aerosolization of l pneumophila inhalation rates and the fractions of aerosols depositing in the alveolar region of the lung ten thousand iterations were used supported by burmaster and anderson 1994 and central tendencies of infection risk were reasonably stable with this number of iterations burmaster and anderson 1994 to conduct a sensitivity analysis spearman correlation coefficients were used to quantify monotonic relationships between input parameters and infection risks for both models where a larger absolute value of a spearman correlation coefficient indicated a stronger influence of the input parameter on the output infection risk spearman correlation coefficients are also appropriate for nonparametric data 2 1 model 1 for estimating dose and infection risk in model 1 the concentration of l pneumophila in the air cfu m3 is a function of the concentration in the water cfu l and a partitioning coefficient cfu m3 cfu l eq 1 schoen and ashbolt 2011 1 c a i r p c c w a t e r a partitioning coefficient was randomly sampled from a triangular distribution minimum 1 10 5 mode 1 10 4 maximum 1 9 10 4 informed by the low value and the best estimate value listed by schoen and asbolt 2011 to estimate the volume of air inhaled an inhalation rate m3 hr b was multiplied by the duration of the exposure an inhalation rate was randomly sampled from a normal distribution mean 1 2 10 2 sd 2 5 10 3 left truncated at zero m3 min informed by the u s environmental protection agency s exposure factors handbook u s environmental protection agency 2011 2 v a i r b t to estimate how the concentration of l pneumophila in the air and the volume of air inhaled relate to dose the fractions of aerosolized l pneumophila in the aerosol size range of 1 5 Î¼m and the fraction of aerosols that reach the alveoli were multiplied by the concentration and volume inhaled while the original model addresses other size ranges 5 6 Î¼m and 6 10 Î¼m there is evidence that particles 5 microns primarily deposit in upper and larger airways of the lung darquenne 2020 and will not remain airborne for as long as particles less than 5 Î¼m fennelly 2020 in terms of other size ranges and deposition in the lung 2 5 Î¼m mostly deposits in the central and small airways and 2 Î¼m in the alveolar region darquenne 2020 although we were interested in deposition in the alveolar region we used 5 Î¼m a cut off since this is the upper limit of the smaller range of particles explored in the original schoen and ashbolt model 1 5 Î¼m for which there are parameterized distributions schoen andand ashbolt 2011 it should be noted that not all aerosols in the size range of 1 5 Î¼m in this model were assumed to deposit in the alveolar region of the lung the fraction of total aerosols 1 5 Î¼m assumed to deposit in the alveolar region was randomly sampled from a triangular distribution minimum 0 midpoint 0 2 maximum 0 54 the percent of 1 5 Âµm range aerosols containing legionella was then randomly sampled from a uniform distribution with a minimum of 75 and a maximum of 100 the dose was then inputted into an exponential dose response curve with parameter k the probability that a single organism survives and arrives at the infection site this dose response curve with an infection endpoint was used in the original work from model 2 hamilton et al 2019 informed by a dose response study of guinea pig data originating from inhalation exposures armstrong and haas 2007 muller et al 1983 no dose response curve was originally used in the development of model 1 as risk was not a main output in that work schoen and ashbolt 2011 therefore the same dose response curve was used in models 1 and 2 3 1 d o s e p c c w a t e r b t f 1 f 2 3 2 d o s e c a i r v a i r f 1 f 2 4 p i n f e c t i o n 1 e k d o s e variables and their distributions can be seen in table 1 the partitioning coefficient values p c and the fraction of l pneumophila in aerosols in size range 1 5 f 1 originate from experimental data in a hospital setting perkins et al 2009 the fraction of aerosols in size range 1 5 that are then assumed to deposit in the lung originate from a chapter of concepts in inhalation toxicology schlesinger 1989 2 2 model 2 for estimating dose and infection risk using model 2 the dose was estimated by multiplying the l pneumophila concentration in the water at the fixture c w a t e r by the breathing rate b duration of exposure t a sum of concentrations of aerosols c a e r i of specific diameter sizes i by their volume sizes v a e r i and a sum of the fraction of l pneumophila in the aerosols of specific sizes f i and the deposition efficiency d i of aerosols of those sizes hamilton et al 2019 the range of aerosol sizes explored here was from 1 to 5 Âµm to be consistent with model 1 and due to mechanistic reasons described above even though larger size ranges are explored in the original work hamilton et al 2019 parameters and their distributions and sources can be seen in table 1 5 d o s e c w a t e r b t i 1 5 c a e r i v a e r i i 1 5 f i d i the concentration of aerosols c a e r i number of aerosols with diameter i Âµm per m3 of various sizes for water efficient or conventional showers originate from experimental studies o toole et al 2008 2009 the fraction of aerosols with diameter i Âµm containing l pneumophila f i and the fraction of aerosols of that size that would then deposit in the lung d i were also informed by experimental data and allegra et al 2016 heyder et al 1986 2 3 relating infection risks to illness risks methodology described by weir et al 2020 was used to relate infection to illness risks weir et al 2020 however it should be noted that individual infection risks per group were not calculated and combined as done by weir et al 2020 rather we directly estimate a population level risk briefly the probability of illness p i l l n e s s was estimated by multiplying the overall population as opposed to stratified by age or sex probability of infection by morbidity ratio proxy m r g for a specific group eq 6 weir et al 2020 6 p i l l n e s s g p i n f e c t i o n m r g the morbidity ratio is estimated by multiplying a national attack rate a r by the ratio of the incidence in a specific group i r g to that of the total population i r p eq 7 7 m r g a r i r g i r p in this study the groups included 8 age ranges males and females 4 races and 2 ethnicity categories based on available incidence data while not measured in this study it should be noted that differences in incidence across race and ethnicity may be due to a myriad of factors including social determinants of health associated with increased legionnaires disease risk e g household income living in older homes or rental properties and higher incidence of legionnaires disease among black or african american individuals relative to white individuals has been reported in other studies barskey et al 2022 in a report of 2016 2017 data deven et al 2020 the cdc reported a national incidence rate of 2 29 100 000 in 2017 which we used to inform i r p to our knowledge a more recent cdc report providing a national incidence rate is not available an estimated national attack rate of 0 05 was used as this has been suggested by weir et al 2020 as a potential value for a r available from osha occupational safety and health administration n d weir et al 2020 since a wide range of inhalation rates representative for males and females of age ranges overlapping with the ranges here it was assumed that the estimated p i n f e c t i o n was representative of an overall population risk weir et al 2020 2 4 comparing deposited doses based on airborne concentrations we hypothesized the driver of differences between the two models would be in how partitioning is handled where in model 1 a ratio for partitioning of all sizes is used however model 2 involves the use of size specific partitioning coefficients to explore how similarly they described deposition of aerosols in the lung specifically we assumed the same concentration of bacteria in the air and updated the models to only describe deposition of aerosols data from allegra et al 2020 were used to inform input parameters for models 1 and 2 allegra et al 2020 hamilton et al 2019 schoen and ashbolt 2011 these parameters included the concentration of legionella in the air that was experimentally measured using a simulated shower setup 2 9 103 bacteria m3 and the inhalation rate 7 5 m3 min allegra et al 2020 because the concentration of air was used as an input as opposed to the concentration in the water eq 1 for model 1 was not used for model comparison for model 2 eq 5 was altered where the concentration of legionella in the air was assumed to be equal to the product of the concentration of legionella in the water c w a t e r and the summation of the number of aerosols of size i per cubic meter of air multiplied by the volume of the aerosol of size i note that this means estimated deposited doses would be the same for conventional and water efficient showers 2 5 app development an interactive app was developed with rshiny where flexible input parameters included log10 cfu ml of legionella in shower water shower duration min risk threshold shower type conventional vs water efficient age and sex age and sex specific inhalation rates were used to result in age and sex specific infection risk estimates the app was then designed to output infection risks estimated over a range of legionella concentrations for the same scenario shower duration shower type age and sex with a point on the lines indicating the estimated mean infection risk for the specific scenario a heatmap of illness risks in the form of cases 100 000 estimated for showers of this duration shower type and with the selected legionella concentration were also outputted for both males and females of ages 55 64 yrs 65 74 yrs 75 84 yrs and 85 yrs stratified by race white african american black asian pacific islander native american illnesses were not estimated for groups with less than 16 cases for informing incidence rates these groups included native american men or women asian pacific islander women and asian pacific islander men ages 75 84 years or 85 table 2 3 results 3 1 infection risks infection risks for conventional showers estimated with model 2 were greatest followed by infection risks for water efficient showers also estimated with model 2 and lastly by infection risk estimates using model 1 fig 1 greater variability was seen for infection risk estimates using model 1 in comparison to model 2 fig 1 these differences in infection risk translated to differences in legionella concentrations that yielded a greater than 1 10 000 infection risk per shower event it should be noted that the 1 10 000 is an annual risk target not originally used to be a target per exposure world health organization 2004 however this threshold and similar ones 5 10 000 have been used in other non water related qmra contexts as a threshold for comparison for exposure specific events harvey et al 2021 wilson et al 2021 while model 1 estimated infection risks straddling a 1 10 000 risk target for a legionella concentration of 10 cfu ml this risk threshold was already surpassed for model 2 for a 7 8 min shower with a legionella concentration of 0 1 cfu ml a concentration and shower duration used by hamilton et al 2019 the average infection risk for conventional showers was 4 8 10 6 sd 3 0 10 6 fig 2 water efficient showers corresponded to an average infection risk of 2 3 10 6 sd 1 7 10 6 and unspecified showers showers from the schoen and ashbolt model that do not specify water efficient vs conventional using model 1 corresponded to an average infection risk of 1 1 10 6 sd 9 7 10 7 fig 2 3 2 comparison of deposited doses for same airborne concentration when models 1 and 2 were used to estimate deposition of legionella in the lungs assuming the same concentration of airborne legionella and disregarding differences in partitioning the central tendencies of estimated deposited doses were similar where the mean estimated doses for models 1 and 2 were 4 0 cfu and 5 2 cfu respectively fig 3 however when these distributions were compared with a wilcoxon rank sum test they were statistically significantly different w 26774006 p 0 001 it should be noted that this was a comparison of 10 000 iterations for each model and that a p value is a function of sample size aside from the statistical implications the overall similarity in magnitude of estimated deposited doses demonstrated that differences in infection risk between the models are likely driven by differences in describing partitioning as opposed to deposited dose more variability in estimated dose was seen for model 1 than for model 2 we therefore used model 2 for app development 3 3 sensitivity analysis of the parameters used to inform deposited dose the factors with the greatest influence on infection risk for model 1 were the dose response curve parameter k 0 54 the partitioning coefficient 0 47 and the fraction of aerosols of sizes 1 5 Î¼m that deposit in the alveolar region of the lung 0 58 fig s1 for model 2 the most influential factor in both the conventional and water efficient fixture models was the dose response curve parameter k 0 82 for conventional and 0 76 for water efficient followed by the inhalation rate b 0 36 for conventional and 0 33 for water efficient fig s1 this may be due in part to smaller ranges of aerosol sizes where no one size drives infection risk fig s1 3 4 app development due to more conservative risk estimates figs 1 and 2 and more refined aerosol size ranges table 1 we utilized the model 2 for risk calculator application development the calculator inputs included legionella concentrations of log10 cfu ml shower duration min risk thresholds 1 1 000 to 1 1 000 000 varying by a power of ten conventional vs water efficient showers age years from 11 to 81 and the sex of the person taking the shower male or female fig 4 infection risk estimates based on inhalation rates for the age and sex selected informed by the u s exposure factors handbook were then used to estimate infection risks for a range of legionella concentrations and the mean infection risk for the selected scenario was plotted fig 4 u s environmental protection agency 2011 if this risk was above the selected risk threshold indicated by a dotted line then the diamond was colored red as opposed to green when it was below the risk threshold this allows for a fast interpretation of the infection risk for the scenario relative to the selected risk threshold illness risks were then plotted below where a population level infection risk not specific to age or sex was used in conjunction with case data table 2 to estimate illness risks ld specifically for men and women of various age ranges and races for a shower with the selected duration and legionella concentration fig 4 a disclaimer was added to the app to communicate its scope of use the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra models are developed from peer reviewed publications and risk factors for legionnaires disease these models are not intended for commercial use or purposes methods used for legionella enumeration may underestimate or overestimate risk 4 discussion two mechanistic models were compared in their estimation of legionella exposures and subsequent infection risks during showering events model 2 which divides aerosols into smaller bin sizes than model 1 for describing partitioning and deposition into the lung produces more conservative risk estimates where average risks for the conventional and water efficient showers were 4 and 2 times greater than risks estimated using model 1 for a shower of the same duration and legionella concentration fig 2 model 2 was utilized in development of the risk calculator tool because it resulted in more conservative risk estimates figs 1 and 2 and was composed of more detailed aerosol size parameters in development of a risk calculator tool table 1 translation of risk assessment tools for interpreting environmental monitoring data is an important development for increasing the impact of mechanistic models for comparing anticipated health outcomes based on environmental conditions and relating these environmental monitoring data to risk threshold goals this study facilitates interpretation of l pneumophila culture monitoring results in infection risk terms the model developed by hamilton et al 2019 in the form of an interactive app will help building owners and operators determine risks of legionella infection and inform decisions on changes that may be required in their water safety management program while traditional culture methods are more typically used for environmental surveillance it is recognized that some facilities use molecular methods for verifying the effectiveness of their water safety management program molecular methods may be favored due to faster results and greater sensitivity one limitation of this method however is that not all detected genome copies represent live l pneumophila for example ditommaso et al 2015 found that the mean log difference between the amount of legionella detected with culture and with qpcr was 1 45 standard deviation 0 24 or qpcr concentrations were approximately 28 times greater than those of culture ditommaso et al 2015 because these were artificial samples more research is needed elucidating ratios of legionella detected with molecular methods and culture methods in real world samples integrating model 2 with the approach developed by weir et al 2020 for relating infection risks to demographically specific illness risks using legionella case data further extends the potential for a risk calculator tool to inform not only risk targets but also to evaluate risks for the most vulnerable populations gleason et al 2017 previously the method developed by weir et al 2020 could only be applied to one demographic variable at one time due to available data not including intersections of these demographic groups using data provided by the cdc in this study we were able to explore intersections of race age and sex as they relate to ld however even with this advancement in available data a current limitation is a lack of legionella case data especially for specific racial groups such as native american individuals making illness estimates potentially unreliable it should be noted that the use of population level health data is limited in that it does not necessarily capture risk of illness for immunocompromised individuals therefore application of this type of tool in environments with immunocompromised individuals such as in healthcare could underestimate risks and should be done with caution a tool such as this may be more useful for large facilities that serve less susceptible populations such as commercial buildings e g hotels or conference centers or institutional e g university dormitories that contain single showers additionally this tool would be more valuable if we had data to inform ld and pontiac fever risks when developing qmra or risk based tools it is important to consider how estimated risk outputs will be interpreted or influence future behavior or potential policies for example while the model we used to develop the tool in this work includes a 95 confidence interval the interpretation of this interval could vary if the model accurately captures reality and the distributions adequately capture variability and uncertainty the 95 confidence interval could communicate the certainty in the risk estimate if there is uncertainty about whether the model captures reality or if the distributions capture uncertainty and variability accurately the 95 confidence interval may only provide information regarding confidence about where the central tendency of the model output truly lies additionally studies of the perception of uncertainty in risk contexts suggests that communicating uncertainty as a numerical range vs with a visual depiction can influence risk perceptions or perceptions of the quality or accuracy of the risk assessment johnson and slovic 1995 van der bles et al 2019 considering that the purposes of qmra or health risk based tools are generally 1 so that risk models are accessible to non experts and 2 so risk models can be applied to protect human health with real world influences on health outcomes effective communication of risk outputs is paramount following the development of a tool surveys focus groups interviews and other methods are useful for determining the tool s interpretability and risk perceptions associated with its output therefore before the official version of this tool would be released more data will be needed regarding usability and interpretability of the tool in water management contexts and development of a user manual designed to address common questions or misconceptions future development efforts to progress the utilization of risk assessment tools for legionella to improve water safety plans or management strategies are warranted leveraging both legionella spp sampling results with technical based information regarding potential risk and illness can improve upon existing water quality guidance values for legionella spp currently being used by building water quality managers this combination can help advance concentration limit recommendations or criteria that may be based on judgment alone more so research to further single point of use qmra models to estimate facility level legionella risks would help give building water quality managers better decision making abilities for general water safety management such as water flushing or business re openings following pandemic related shutdowns public areas where consumers and tourists frequently visit may also experience increased risks of legionellosis with increasing temperature relative humidity and precipitation de giglio et al 2019 fisman et al 2005 the favorability of environments for legionella growth is influenced by sunlight intensity rainfall and water temperature beautÃ© et al 2016 walker 2018 climate change and the potential for increased legionellosis risks highlight the need for education and awareness of exposure risks for everyday water activities walker 2018 accessible dissemination of risk based knowledge is imperative for increasing public awareness and thereby protecting public health further development of user friendly and digestible risk based tools is an underutilized approach for addressing the increased need for interpretation of environmental monitoring results and understanding how behavior related parameters such as shower duration and demographic variables influence risk more data to inform these models especially human behavior data population specific risk factors and temporal and spatial variability of legionella concentrations at points of use will be useful for increasing the reliability of risk modeling tools additionally while a 1 10 000 threshold is used in this study as a point of comparison for individual risks as opposed to its use in drinking water as an annual risk threshold acceptable risk thresholds may vary by context and community more efforts are needed to characterize communities acceptable risks so these may drive concentration thresholds and health in built environments 5 conclusion this research adds to the body of knowledge demonstrating the value of qmra in legionella risk assessment we recognize the limitations of the model as not all strains of legionella spp are equally infective and pathogenic however this qmra model will help inform building owners and operators of three important principles 1 understand the value in enumerating legionella in their premise plumbing system 2 recognize that lower legionella counts reduce infection risk and 3 zero risk is not achievable a standard assumption in qmra models but actions taken as part of a water management program can reduce risk by factors of 10 fold or more assuming a 10 fold reduction in concentration relates to a 10 fold reduction in risk authors contributions all authors contributed to the

15784,nitrogen and phosphate removal from wastewater relies on different functional bacteria in this study a novel strain affiliated with pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from activated sludge by gradient dilution and performed heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification and aerobic phosphate removal hnadpr the strain showed an ammonium removal efficiency of 87 and a phosphate removal efficiency of 97 under optimal conditions such as c n ratio of 10 p n ratio of 0 1 temperature of 30 c and ph of 7 5 8 5 the modified gompertz model could fit well the heterotrophic ammonium

heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification simultaneous nitrogen and phosphate removal aerobic phosphate removal model nitrogen removal pathway phosphorus species 1 introduction eutrophication mainly caused by excessive nitrogen n and phosphorus p from domestic sewage as well as industrial and agriculture effluents impairs human health and ecological functions elser et al 2007 to largely prevent the eutrophication of surface water bodies the removal of n and p from the point source wastewater is crucial for decades biological nutrient removal bnr was widely used to remove nutrients from wastewater as it is an environmentally friendly and cost efficient approach chen et al 2021 in wastewater treatment plants wwtps several mainstream bnr processes such as the anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o process the process of university of cape town uct and oxidation ditch have frequently been applied vermande et al 2002 the bnr is performed in multiple tanks or phases in which functional microorganisms involved in n and p removal are provided with optimal conditions specifically n removal is achieved via the combination of autotrophic nitrification in the aerobic tank conversion of ammonium into nitrite nitrate and heterotrophic denitrification in the anoxic tank conversion of nitrite nitrate into gaseous n kim et al 2009 the p removal in turn relies on p accumulating organisms paos and denitrifying p accumulating organisms dpaos which require alternating anaerobic and aerobic anoxic conditions yang et al 2019 since functional bacteria have different physiological and biochemical requirements simultaneous n and p removal limits the performance of wwtps for example it is difficult to set the sludge retention time srt in the bnr process because nitrifiers characterized by slow growth require a long srt whereas paos dpaos require a short srt to achieve p removal competition between heterotrophic denitrification bacteria and paos dpaos for the limited carbon source in wastewater occurs frequently impeding the construction of a stable and persistent n and p removal system guerrero et al 2011 despite continuous efforts and innovations bnr based on various functional bacteria is limited by the complex construction high construction costs unstable performance and high area requirement in this sense the innovation of bnr depends on the application of novel functional microorganisms microorganisms performing heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification hn ad can simultaneously remove organic matter and convert ammonium and nitrite nitrate in the aerobic phase into gaseous n song et al 2021 since the 1980s researchers have been isolating several hn ad strains from oligotrophic niches activated sludge industrial wastewater paddy soil and halophilic granular sludge cui et al 2021 these hn ad isolates convert ammonium into nitrogen gas n2 via aerobic denitrification nh4 nh2oh no2 no3 no2 no n2o n2 or hydroxylamine transformation to n2o and or n2 rather than nitrite nh4 nh2oh no n2o n2 in recent years three bacterial strains i e thauera sp snd5 wang and he 2020 bacillus subtilis ghsp10 zhang et al 2021 and arthrobacter sp hhep5 zhang et al 2020 have been isolated they not only simultaneously perform nitrification denitrification but can also remove phosphate thauera sp snd5 wang and he 2020 can remove n via the hn ad pathway under aerobic conditions and also functions as a dpao for p removal under alternating anaerobic and anoxic conditions aerobic p removal has been observed in bacillus subtilis ghsp10 zhang et al 2021 and arthrobacter sp hhep5 zhang et al 2020 both of which can simultaneously remove n via the hn ad pathway under aerobic conditions this suggests that some hn ad strains can remove p under aerobic conditions instead of requiring a cycle with anaerobic and anoxic aerobic phases if these functional groups can be enriched in activated sludge the treatment process could be shortened and would only require one reactor most importantly issues based on carbon source limitation competition among bacteria and operation complexity could be resolved however only few hn ad strains show aerobic p removal for growth or polyphosphate accumulation and the mechanism of aerobic p removal is still not fully understood hence more strains performing hn ad and aerobic p removal apr need to be isolated to investigate their n and p removal mechanisms which is the basis for their potential application in wwtps in this study a novel strain affiliated with pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from activated sludge in enrichment media with high n and p levels under aerobic conditions its ability to perform heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification and aerobic p removal hnadpr was investigated the n and p removal performance was evaluated considering various factors such as carbon source type c n ratio p n ratio initial ammonium concentration temperature and ph emphasis was placed on the pathways of n and p metabolism the combined hn ad and apr pathway was estimated by determining the key functional genes and the distribution of p species and the concept model of aerobic phosphate removal by a hn ad strain is proposed for the first time 2 material and methods 2 1 media applied in experiments enrichment medium em with high levels of n

termed hnm aerobic denitrification termed adm and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification termed sndm the adm 1 and adm 2 contained nitrite and nitrate respectively as the sole n source whereas sndm 1 contained ammonium and nitrite as mixed n sources and sndm 2 contained ammonium and nitrate as mixed n sources the media and their components are listed in table 1 the initial ph was adjusted by adding 1 0 mol l hcl or naoh all reagents used were of analytical grade 2 2 enrichment isolation and identification of strains two different types of em em 1 and em 2 were used in succession to enrich functional bacteria from activated sludge taken from a local wastewater treatment plant wwtp in beijing china the em 1 containing ammonium as the sole n source was used to enrich heterotrophic nitrifiers the em 2 containing ammonium and nitrate was used to further enrich the nitrifiers with aerobic denitrification function the sampled activated sludge was inoculated in a conical flask 150

24 h the suspended liquid was diluted to 10 1 to 10 7 with sterile water subsequently 0 5 ml of the diluted culture was spread on solid em 2 liquid em 2 with 2 agar and inoculated at 35 c for 48 h single colonies were picked and streaked on solid em 2 three times to obtain purified isolates these isolates were separately inoculated into em 2 and cultured at 35 c and 120 rpm after 24 h of cultivation the levels of ammonium nitrate and phosphate in the medium were measured strains with the capacity of simultaneous ammonium nitrate and phosphate removal were selected as candidate strains

375 g sucrose c12h22o11 and 2 500 g glucose c6h12o6 per liter medium in all experiments a 1 ml isolate suspension with an optical density at 600 nm od600 of 1 0 was inoculated into a 150 ml conical flask containing 100 ml medium in a gas bath shaker thz 98ab bluepard china at 120 rpm based on the results of the carbon source experiments in the c n ratio tests sodium citrate was used as the optimal carbon source its concentration was adjusted to yield c n ratios of 2 5 5 10 15 and 20 by maintaining an initial ammonium concentration of 100 mg n l the series of p n ratios 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 6

threshold at p value 0 05 the modified gompertz model eq 1 which had been widely used to predict substrate removal in heterotrophic nitrification yang et al 2019 and aerobic denitrification lu et al 2019 was adopted to assess the progress curves of the removal of each nutrient ammonium nitrite nitrate phosphate during hnadpr the equation is as follows 1 s s0 1 exp exp erm t0 t s0 1 where s is the nutrient concentration at a certain time mg l s0 is the initial nutrient concentration mg l rm is the maximum degradation rate mg l h t0 is the lag phase time h t is the reaction time h and e is the mathematical constant 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation and identification an isolate with the ability to simultaneously perform nitrification and denitrification as well as p removal was named sndpr 01 the strain was a gram negative motile and short rod shaped bacterium with a size of 1 5 5 Î¼m 0 5 1 Î¼m fig 1 a it formed flat semi opaque smooth surfaced and irregular edged colonies on the solid medium interestingly the strain secreted a water soluble green pigment homology analysis on the partial 16s rrna sequence showed that the isolated strain was closely affiliated with pseudomonas aeruginosa 100 similarity this strain and the pseudomonas aeruginosa strain cneb25 formed a distinct cluster within a dendrogram away from other reported sndpr strains fig 1b according to a previous study pseudomonas aeruginosa could perform hn ad in wastewater treatment plants wei et al 2021 however the sndpr function of pseudomonas aeruginosa has not been reported 3 2 condition optimization a series of experiments were performed to optimize the conditions for sndpr performance and isolate growth the carbon source types influenced both sndpr performance and growth fig 2 a sodium citrate was the preferred carbon source resulting in the highest ammonium and phosphate removal efficiency more than 99 and biomass concentration od600 1 09 after 24 h culture although the phosphate removal efficiency pre did not significantly change when sodium citrate and sodium acetate were used as carbon sources p 0 05 the ammonium removal efficiency are significantly declined with the use of sodium acetate p 0 05 when sodium succinate glucose and saccharose were used as carbon sources ares and pres significantly decreased p 0 05 in comparison to the use of sodium acetate the growth of the isolate was also inhibited when saccharose and glucose were applied indicating that organic acid rather than sugar was the preferable carbon source for strain sndpr 01 similar results have been observed for pseudomonas stutzeri yg 24 li et al 2015 table 3 with the optimal carbon source sodium citrate the optimal c n ratio was achieved fig 2b both n and p removal efficiencies varied with c n ratios at ratios of 10 and 15 high nutrient removal was observed are of 95 and 97 pre of 94 and 93 respectively the od600 variation showed a tendency similar to that of nutrient removal low c n ratios 2 5 5 and a high c n ratio 20 inhibited bacterial growth consequently impeding the functions of the investigated strain strain sndpr 01 showed a moderate c n requirement similar to most reported sndpr bacteria table 3 the p n ratio had different effects on n and p removal fig 2c at values of 0 2 0 8 n removal was similar with an are above 97 in contrast an are of 82 was obtained at a p n ratio of 0 1 since the p concentration remained constant these results indicated an inhibition of n removal at high ammonium concentrations in contrast the highest pre 98 was found at a p n ratio of 0 1 indicating that the efficient removal of p is related to high ammonium concentrations isolate growth showed a consistent trend with pre the highest od600 of 1 04 was found at a p n ratio of 0 1 according to previous studies table 3 the optimal p n ratio for most sndpr bacteria is 0 1 0 2 indicating their preferences for low p and high n values to further explore the tolerance of strain sndpr 01 to ammonium different initial nh4 n concentrations with a p n ratio of 0 1 were tested fig 2d although the p in the influent varied with n the pre maintained relatively constant indicating that the initial p concentration does not considerably affect strain sndpr 01 in contrast the n removal rates at initial nh4 n concentrations of 150 300 mg l were significantly lower than those at 50 100 mg l p 0 05 indicating inhibition of the n removal function based on these results strain sndpr 01 can function at nh4 n concentrations below 100 mg l at 30 c the isolates showed the highest od600 value 0 91 as well as are 65 and pre 99 values fig 2e at 35 and 40 c ammonium and phosphate removal efficiencies of 60 or higher were achieved most sndpr strains showed optimal growth and nutrient removal efficiencies at 30 c table 3 strain sndpr 01 could tolerate a higher temperature than the other reported strains within a ph range of 5 5 9 5 strain sndpr 01 could survive and remove nutrients fig 2f at a ph of 7 5 the highest od600 value 0 85 and pre 95 were observed similar to those at ph 8 5 this optimal ph range of strain sndpr 01 is similar to that reported for most sndpr strains in table 3 in addition the variation trend of od600 with ph was in line with that of pre however with increasing ph values the are increased continuously from 34 to 54 3 3 phosphate removal mode fig 3 a shows the evolution of ammonium phosphate and cod under aerobic anaerobic aerobic conditions in the aerobic phase phosphate and ammonium in the solution significantly decreased with the growth of the isolate with the decrease in the cod concentration intracellular glycogen remained constant at the beginning of the first aerobic phase with some level of uncertainty due to the spike at 12 h from 12 to 28 h intracellular glycogen gradually decreased showing its use under insufficient substrate availability the intracellular pha in contrast was not stored in the subsequent anaerobic condition strain sndpr 01 did not assimilate ammonium and p and did not proliferate during the anaerobic phase the intracellular glycogen concentration decreased with reaction time whereas pha accumulation was not observed implying that glycogen was used for cell maintenance and survival after switching to aerobic conditions growth and nutrient removal were immediately resumed intracellular storage and nutrient removal were comparable to the first aerobic stage in the successive four aerobic cycles strain sndpr 01 constantly took up phosphate resulting in a stable p removal efficiency the results indicated that strain sndpr 01 retained its p metabolism in successive aerobic conditions along with the use of n and p proliferation of strain sndpr 01 was observed fig 3b in addition growth and nutrient removal were highly dependent on the do level and biomass as well as n and p removal performance increased linearly with increasing shaking speeds 0 160 rpm fig 3c based on these results strain sndpr 01 did not follow the p metabolism mode of paos under alternate anaerobic aerobic conditions in the aerobic stage paos excessively take up phosphate to synthesize intracellular poly phosphate poly p and accumulate glycogen comeau et al 1986 in the subsequent anaerobic stage paos hydrolyze poly p and glycogen to provide energy and reducing power for pha synthesis zhou et al 2010 in contrast phosphate release or glycogen hydrolysis did not occur under anaerobic conditions implying that strain sndpr 01 had a different p metabolism pathway in this regard the anaerobic phase is not a prerequisite for p metabolism in strain sndpr 01 aerobic p removal strains such as shewanella sp cf8 6 jiang et al 2018 arthrobacter sp hhep5 zhang et al 2020 and bacillus subtilis ghsp10 zhang et al 2021 have been described similar to strain sndpr 01 these strains performed phosphate removal under aerobic conditions although their p metabolism remains unknown 3 4 the sndpr ability and kinetics analysis strain sndpr 01 showed heterotrophic nitrification when ammonium was applied as the sole n source it was removed under aerobic conditions without nox accumulation during heterotrophic nitrification phosphate was degraded with a pre of 97 table 4 the concentrations of ammonium and phosphate increased in 24 32 h which could have been induced by bacterial mortality and cell lysis both ammonium and phosphate removal could be fitted well into the modified gompertz model r 2 0 98 fig 4 b the maximum ammonium degradation rate was 6 24 mg n l h and the maximum phosphate removal rate was 1 01 mg p l h both ammonium and phosphate were removed synchronously with a lag phase t0 of 4 64 h for ammonium and 4 51 h for phosphate when nitrite was applied as the sole n source it was completely removed by sndpr 01 fig 4c indicating a good aerobic nitrite removal performance the phosphate was also removed under aerobic conditions with a pre of 91 the removal of nitrite and phosphate could be well fitted into the modified gompertz model r 2 0 97 fig 4d the t0 of nitrite was 13 81 h over three times longer than that of ammonium in nitrification however the maximum nitrite removal rate was 14 72 mg n l h which was two times higher than the maximum ammonium removal rate in nitrification this indicated that nitrite could inhibit the activity of strain sndpr 01 after strain sndpr 01 had adapted to the high nitrite concentration it showed an excellent nitrite removal ability in addition phosphate removal was also inhibited by nitrite with a t0 of 7 55 h when nitrate was used as the sole n source the same significant removal efficiency was achieved fig 4e according to the fitting results of the modified gompertz model rm and t0 of nitrate were 7 23 mg n l h and 8 97 h r2 0 96 respectively during aerobic denitrification nitrite was accumulated with the maximum concentration of 12 7 mg n l which finally decreased to zero the temporary accumulation of nitrite indicated that nitrate was first transformed into nitrite also during aerobic denitrification a significant phosphate removal was observed comparing the results of three feedings ammonium nitrite and nitrate the lowest rm of phosphate was observed in adm 2 with nitrate as the sole n source table 4 suggesting that in strain sndpr 01 heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification are related to phosphate metabolism a similar phenomenon has been observed in sndpr strain pseudomonas stutzeri yg 24 li et al 2015 heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification are important energy metabolic pathways since they both follow a long pathway from ammonium to gaseous n the energy amount from ammonium removal is higher than that from nitrite or nitrate removal even denitrifying nitrite and nitrate could also result in different energy amounts kuypers et al 2018 therefore it is reasonable to infer that differences in energy supply lead to different p removal rates and efficiencies further studies are needed to verify this assumption when ammonium and nitrite were used as mixed n sources strain sndpr 01 decomposed ammonium and nitrite with the increase of biomass fig 4g ammonium and nitrite could be completely removed with rm values of 5 95 and 17 31 mg n l h respectively the t0 of nitrite 14 44 h was similar to that when nitrite was the sole n source the t0 of ammonium 9 25 h in the process was nearly twice as high as that obtained with the use of nitrite as the sole n source showing that nitrite could slow down ammonium degradation during the process the nitrate level was below 5 mg l and approached zero at the end of the batch experiment strain sndpr 01 showed simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd when ammonium and nitrate were used as the mixed n sources a similar snd phenomenon could be observed fig 4i during the process less than 6 30 mg n l of nitrite was accumulated similar to what was observed when nitrate was the sole n source fig 4e aerobic phosphate removal occurred during snd with rm values of 0 59 and 0 93 mg l h in sndm 1 and sndm 2 respectively the nutrient degradation during sndpr could be accurately characterized by the modified gompertz equation r 2 0 9 fig 4h and j 3 5 p distribution during hn ad during hn ad the p balance was established via calculating the tp in the solution cell membrane intracell areas and eps in all five feedings containing sole and mixed n sources the p distribution showed a similar trend fig 5 along with the growth of the investigated strain p in the solution was gradually converted into cell membrane intracell areas and eps at the end of the reaction 24 h of cultivation most of the p in solution had been incorporated into cellular biomass despite the different p removal efficiencies observed the p distribution in the cytoplasm cell membrane and eps was similar with approximately 10 19 of p in the cytoplasm 14 41 in the cell membrane and 37 46 in the eps this indicated that p in solution was mostly converted into eps and cell membrane which formed the p pool the differences in n composition could influence the p distribution when ammonium was used as the sole n source fig 5a the p content in the cell membrane pmembrane accounted for 41 which was slightly higher than that in eps 37 however when nitrite or nitrate were used as the sole n source fig 5b and c pmembrane 14 and 17 was significantly lower than peps 45 and 46 when ammonium was used as n source alongside nitrite or nitrate the p pooled in eps was increased this illustrated that aerobic denitrification might boost the p conversion into eps and that strain sndpr 01 pooled a considerable amount of p in eps or cell membrane during hn ad some aerobic p removal strains such as shewanella sp cf8 6 jiang et al 2018 and diutina rugosa bl3 sun et al 2021 also mainly accumulate phosphate in eps accounting for 60 70 the paos stored p intracellularly by up to 90 whereas the peps was approximately 5 9 zhang et al 2013 strain sndpr 01 showed the opposite p distribution in comparison to paos suggesting a novel p removal mechanism 3 6 p species within cells and eps of strain sndpr 01 to understand the p metabolic pathway of strain sndpr 01 it was essential to ascertain the species of p in the membrane cells and eps since the membrane was mainly composed of phospholipids the species of p in the membrane were not further determined according to the results of 31p nmr spectroscopy the signals of orthophosphate 6 504 ppm phosphate monoester 4 898 and 4 765 ppm and diester 1 637 ppm were observed inside the cells fig 6 a orthophosphate was the main p species within cells followed by phosphate monoester and diester different results were observed for diutina rugosa bl3 sun et al 2021 with five p species including orthophosphate phosphate monoester phosphate diester pyrophosphate and polyphosphate within cells it should be noted that 31p nmr spectroscopy did not show the existence of polyphosphate or pyrophosphate in strain sndpr 01 since the detection limit of 31p nmr for polyphosphate and pyrophosphate is relatively high the existence of polyphosphate and pyrophosphate needs to be verified by other methods herein we employed the detection of polyphosphate kinase ppk and exopolyphosphatase ppx which are responsible for catalyzing phosphate assimilation and polyphosphate hydrolysis in paos respectively li et al 2015 the successful amplification of ppk gene and ppx gene supports the assumption that strain sndpr 01 can synthesize polyphosphate via orthophosphate and hydrolyze polyphosphate to orthophosphate fig 6b only the signal of phosphate monoester 5 103 ppm 3 400 4 270 ppm was observed via 31p nmr spectroscopy of eps extracts fig 6a indicating that phosphate monoester was the sole p species in eps this finding is in agreement with previous observations jiang et al 2018 sun et al 2021 3 7 the hn ad pathway all functional genes amoa hao napa nirs cnorb and nosz genes could be amplified in our study fig s1 suggesting the presence of these genes in the genome of strain sndp 01 generally amoa encoded ammonia monooxygenase amo oxidizing nh4 n to nh2oh n whereas hao encoded hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao oxidizing nh2oh n to no2 n the napa encoded periplasmic nitrate reductase nap reducing no3 n to no2 n and nirs encoded nitrite reductase nir reducing no2 n to no the cnorb encoded nitric oxide reductase reducing no to n2o and nosz encoded nitrous oxide reductase reducing n2o to n2 although the nxr gene encoding nitrite oxygenase was not amplified nitrate could be detected when nitrite was used as the sole n source this illustrates the ability to oxidize nitrite to nitrate and allows the speculation that strain sndpr 01 followed the complete nitrification and denitrification pathway i e nh4 nh2oh no2 no3 no2 no n2o n2 the pathway of hn ad has been found in various bacteria such as bacillus cereus gs 5 and exiguobacterium mexicanum strain snd 01 rout et al 2017 cui et al 2021 the long n metabolism pathway could benefit energy generation 3 8 the hypothetic aerobic phosphate removal model combining the results the hypothetic aerobic phosphate removal model of strain sndpr 01was proposed to demonstrate p transportation and transformation fig 7 under strict aerobic conditions orthophosphate in solution can easily pass the eps matrix and be transported into cells through the phosphate transporters on the membrane zhang et al 2021 in the cytoplasm orthophosphate can be synthesized into membrane phospholipids polyphosphates and phosphate monoester and diester the mutual transformation of polyphosphate and orthophosphate is catalyzed by ppk and ppx which could serve as the energy generation pathway this transformation with a dynamic balance between hydrolysis and synthesis is rapid avoiding the accumulation of polyphosphate within cells in addition some of the intracellular orthophosphate could be synthesized into phosphate ester by phosphate kinase including phosphate monoester and diester phosphate monoesters are the main compounds of mononucleotides and inositol phosphates jorgensen et al 2011 in contrast phospholipids phosphonates ribonucleic acid rna and deoxyribonucleic acid dna are mainly composed of phosphate diesters jorgensen et al 2011 therefore the conversion of orthophosphate into phosphate monoesters and or diesters contributed to the synthesis of genetic material phosphate diester could also be degraded to orthophosphate by phosphatase or transformed into phosphate monoester when growth is limited su 2021 subsequently phosphate monoester can be hydrolyzed to orthophosphate by phosphatase vincent et al 1992 in addition phosphate monoester can be transported outside the cells because of their high affinity to the eps matrix jiang et al 2018 the hypothetic model has two issues one is the energy supply for p metabolism conventionally energy can be obtained via p metabolism the sole generated energy pathway is from hydrolysis of polyphosphate to orthophosphate in the model more energy is required for the synthesis of phospholipids phosphate monoesters and diesters in strain sndpr 01 which means that there is an energy gap in the model the relationship between hn ad and aerobic p removal infers that the energy needed for p metabolism is obtained via hn ad metabolism the other issue is related to the role of monoesters pooled in eps a large amount of removed phosphate accumulated in eps in the form of monoesters based on the experiments on continuous aerobic phosphate removal it is assumed that phosphate can persistently be removed and accumulated this phenomenon poses the question about the function of the phosphate monoesters accumulating in eps which requires further research 4 conclusions a novel strain pseudomonas aeruginosa sndpr 01 was isolated and its hnadpr ability was shown it performed efficient simultaneous n and p removal under the optimal conditions such as sodium citrate as carbon source c n ratio of 10 p n ratio of 0 1 initial ammonium concentration of 100 mg l temperature of 30 c and ph of 7 5 8 5 strain sndpr 01 could perform phosphate removal under strict aerobic conditions rather than alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions under heterotrophic and aerobic conditions strain sndpr 01 removed ammonium nitrite and nitrate without the accumulation of intermediate products it is assumed that strain sndpr 01 can perform the complete hn ad pathway based on the successful amplification of functional genes involved in hn ad with the removal of n phosphate was gradually transported into the cell membrane and eps orthophosphate and phosphate esters were the main p species in cells whereas phosphate monoester was the sole p species in eps a hypothetic model is proposed to present the possible aerobic phosphate removal pathway in strain sndpr 01

15784,nitrogen and phosphate removal from wastewater relies on different functional bacteria in this study a novel strain affiliated with pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from activated sludge by gradient dilution and performed heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification and aerobic phosphate removal hnadpr the strain showed an ammonium removal efficiency of 87 and a phosphate removal efficiency of 97 under optimal conditions such as c n ratio of 10 p n ratio of 0 1 temperature of 30 c and ph of 7 5 8 5 the modified gompertz model could fit well the heterotrophic ammonium

heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification simultaneous nitrogen and phosphate removal aerobic phosphate removal model nitrogen removal pathway phosphorus species 1 introduction eutrophication mainly caused by excessive nitrogen n and phosphorus p from domestic sewage as well as industrial and agriculture effluents impairs human health and ecological functions elser et al 2007 to largely prevent the eutrophication of surface water bodies the removal of n and p from the point source wastewater is crucial for decades biological nutrient removal bnr was widely used to remove nutrients from wastewater as it is an environmentally friendly and cost efficient approach chen et al 2021 in wastewater treatment plants wwtps several mainstream bnr processes such as the anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o process the process of university of cape town uct and oxidation ditch have frequently been applied vermande et al 2002 the bnr is performed in multiple tanks or phases in which functional microorganisms involved in n and p removal are provided with optimal conditions specifically n removal is achieved via the combination of autotrophic nitrification in the aerobic tank conversion of ammonium into nitrite nitrate and heterotrophic denitrification in the anoxic tank conversion of nitrite nitrate into gaseous n kim et al 2009 the p removal in turn relies on p accumulating organisms paos and denitrifying p accumulating organisms dpaos which require alternating anaerobic and aerobic anoxic conditions yang et al 2019 since functional bacteria have different physiological and biochemical requirements simultaneous n and p removal limits the performance of wwtps for example it is difficult to set the sludge retention time srt in the bnr process because nitrifiers characterized by slow growth require a long srt whereas paos dpaos require a short srt to achieve p removal competition between heterotrophic denitrification bacteria and paos dpaos for the limited carbon source in wastewater occurs frequently impeding the construction of a stable and persistent n and p removal system guerrero et al 2011 despite continuous efforts and innovations bnr based on various functional bacteria is limited by the complex construction high construction costs unstable performance and high area requirement in this sense the innovation of bnr depends on the application of novel functional microorganisms microorganisms performing heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification hn ad can simultaneously remove organic matter and convert ammonium and nitrite nitrate in the aerobic phase into gaseous n song et al 2021 since the 1980s researchers have been isolating several hn ad strains from oligotrophic niches activated sludge industrial wastewater paddy soil and halophilic granular sludge cui et al 2021 these hn ad isolates convert ammonium into nitrogen gas n2 via aerobic denitrification nh4 nh2oh no2 no3 no2 no n2o n2 or hydroxylamine transformation to n2o and or n2 rather than nitrite nh4 nh2oh no n2o n2 in recent years three bacterial strains i e thauera sp snd5 wang and he 2020 bacillus subtilis ghsp10 zhang et al 2021 and arthrobacter sp hhep5 zhang et al 2020 have been isolated they not only simultaneously perform nitrification denitrification but can also remove phosphate thauera sp snd5 wang and he 2020 can remove n via the hn ad pathway under aerobic conditions and also functions as a dpao for p removal under alternating anaerobic and anoxic conditions aerobic p removal has been observed in bacillus subtilis ghsp10 zhang et al 2021 and arthrobacter sp hhep5 zhang et al 2020 both of which can simultaneously remove n via the hn ad pathway under aerobic conditions this suggests that some hn ad strains can remove p under aerobic conditions instead of requiring a cycle with anaerobic and anoxic aerobic phases if these functional groups can be enriched in activated sludge the treatment process could be shortened and would only require one reactor most importantly issues based on carbon source limitation competition among bacteria and operation complexity could be resolved however only few hn ad strains show aerobic p removal for growth or polyphosphate accumulation and the mechanism of aerobic p removal is still not fully understood hence more strains performing hn ad and aerobic p removal apr need to be isolated to investigate their n and p removal mechanisms which is the basis for their potential application in wwtps in this study a novel strain affiliated with pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from activated sludge in enrichment media with high n and p levels under aerobic conditions its ability to perform heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification and aerobic p removal hnadpr was investigated the n and p removal performance was evaluated considering various factors such as carbon source type c n ratio p n ratio initial ammonium concentration temperature and ph emphasis was placed on the pathways of n and p metabolism the combined hn ad and apr pathway was estimated by determining the key functional genes and the distribution of p species and the concept model of aerobic phosphate removal by a hn ad strain is proposed for the first time 2 material and methods 2 1 media applied in experiments enrichment medium em with high levels of n and p was used to enrich simultaneous nitrification denitrification and phosphate removal sndpr microorganisms three different media were used to determine the capacity of heterotrophic nitrification termed hnm aerobic denitrification termed adm and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification termed sndm the adm 1 and adm 2 contained nitrite and nitrate respectively as the sole n source whereas sndm 1 contained ammonium and nitrite as mixed n sources and sndm 2 contained ammonium and nitrate as mixed n sources the media and their components are listed in table 1 the initial ph was adjusted by adding 1 0 mol l hcl or naoh all reagents used were of analytical grade 2 2 enrichment isolation and identification of strains two different types of em em 1 and em 2 were used in succession to enrich functional bacteria from activated sludge taken from a local wastewater treatment plant wwtp in beijing china the em 1 containing ammonium as the sole n source was used to enrich heterotrophic nitrifiers the em 2 containing ammonium and nitrate was used to further enrich the nitrifiers with aerobic denitrification function the sampled activated sludge was inoculated in a conical flask 150 ml containing 100 ml em 1 after 24 h of incubation at 35 c and 120 rpm the mixed solution 10 ml was added to another flask 150 ml containing 100 ml em 2 followed by culturing at 35 c and 120 rpm for 24 h the suspended liquid was diluted to 10 1 to 10 7 with sterile water subsequently 0 5 ml of the diluted culture was spread on solid em 2 liquid em 2 with 2 agar and inoculated at 35 c for 48 h single colonies were picked and streaked on solid em 2 three times to obtain purified isolates these isolates were separately inoculated into em 2 and cultured at 35 c and 120 rpm after 24 h of cultivation the levels of ammonium nitrate and phosphate in the medium were measured strains with the capacity of simultaneous ammonium nitrate and phosphate removal were selected as candidate strains for further experiments the 16s rrna gene of isolates was partially amplified and sequenced to establish their taxonomy the acquired nucleotide sequence was analyzed using the basic local alignment search tool blast of the national center for biotechnology and information ncbi the phylogenetic tree was conducted via neighbor joining phylogenesis using mega 7 0 with 1000 bootstraps bacterial

observation under a microscope dp71 olympus japan 2 3 condition optimization for growth and function a series of single factor shake flask experiments were conducted with hnm to evaluate the effects on growth and function of the strain such as carbon sources c n p n initial ammonium concentration temperature and ph the composition of the hnm was adjusted according to the experimental design in the carbon source experiments hnm with a single carbon source was synthesized by separately adding 3 583 g sodium citrate c6h5na3o7 3 417 g sodium acetate c2h3nao2 3 375 g sodium succinate c4h4na2o4 2 375 g sucrose c12h22o11 and 2 500 g glucose c6h12o6 per liter medium in all experiments a 1 ml isolate suspension with an optical density at 600 nm od600 of 1 0 was inoculated into a 150 ml conical flask containing 100 ml medium in a gas bath shaker thz 98ab bluepard china at 120 rpm based on the results of the carbon source experiments in the c n ratio tests sodium citrate was used as the optimal carbon source its concentration was adjusted to yield c n ratios of 2 5 5 10 15 and 20 by maintaining an initial ammonium concentration of 100 mg n l the series of p n ratios 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 was achieved by adjusting the nh4cl concentration with a constant phosphate concentration of 10 mg p l based on the results of the c n experiments to maintain the optimal c n ratio of 10 the sodium citrate concentration was also synchronously adjusted with nh4cl the p n ratio of 0 1 was maintained in experiments testing the effects of the initial ammonium concentration ammonium concentrations in hnm were adjusted to 50 100 150 200 and 300 mg n l based on the results of the c n and p n experiments an optimal c n p ratio of 100 10 1 was maintained in the temperature experiments reaction temperatures were controlled at 20 25 30 35 and 40 c at an optimal temperature of 30 c the initial ph of hnm was controlled at 5 5 6 5 7 5 8 5 and 9 5 by adding 1 mol l hcl or naoh samples were taken regularly to determine the od600 value as well as the levels of nh4 n and po4 3 p all experiments were performed in triplicate and media without inoculation were used as control 2 4 phosphate removal mode the phosphate removal mode by the isolates was identified by a series of experiments with hnm containing p at 10 mg l after 28 h precultivation in hnm the isolate suspension was harvested after centrifugation at 14 000 g for 10 min and washing with sterile water three times according to the p removal mechanism of paos alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions are necessary in experiments using the aerobic anaerobic aerobic mode the harvested pellets were placed into a 500 ml conical flask with 300 ml hnm the first aerobic period lasted for 28 h at 120 rpm and 30 c under anaerobic conditions the mixed liquid was transferred into an airtight serological bottle which was flushed with argon gas at least 10 min prior to the experiments mixing was performed using a magnetic stirrer and the reaction lasted for 24 h at 30 c under aerobic conditions the suspension liquid in the serological bottle was transmitted into a 500 ml conical flask and cultured for 14 h at 120 rpm during the experiment regular samples were taken to measure od600 and nh4 n po4 3 p chemical oxygen demand cod intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoate pha and glycogen levels in the aerobic anaerobic aerobic experiment the isolate removed phosphate only under aerobic conditions the continuous aerobic experiment was performed to further explore whether the isolate could constantly remove phosphate under aerobic conditions in the continuous aerobic mode after precultivation the isolates were resuspended in sterile water and 3 ml of the bacterial suspension approximately od600 of 1 0 was added to a 500 ml conical flask containing 300 ml of hnm the reaction was carried out at 30 c and 120 rpm until n and p in the medium were depleted subsequently the mixed liquid was centrifuged at 14 000 g for 10 min to harvest the pellets which were washed with sterile water three times to determine the capacity of continuous phosphate removal the p rich pellets were inoculated in a 500 ml conical flask containing 300 ml of hnm for the new treatment cycle the same operation was repeated for another four cycles in experiments to establish the effect of dissolved oxygen do on n and p removal the same operation was performed at different shaking speeds 0 40 80 120 and 160 rpm which yielded different do levels 0 2 0 5 1 0 1 4 2 4 2 8 4 5 5 1 and 7 1 7

following a previous study cui et al 2021 results were presented as means standard deviations statistical single factor analysis of variance anova was carried with spss 26 0 with a significance threshold at p value 0 05 the modified gompertz model eq 1 which had been widely used to predict substrate removal in heterotrophic nitrification yang et al 2019 and aerobic denitrification lu et al 2019 was adopted to assess the progress curves of the removal of each nutrient ammonium nitrite nitrate phosphate during hnadpr the equation is as follows 1 s s0 1 exp exp erm t0 t s0 1 where s is the nutrient concentration at a certain time mg l s0 is the initial nutrient concentration mg l rm is the maximum degradation rate mg l h t0 is the lag phase time h t is the reaction time h and e is the mathematical constant 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation and identification an isolate with the ability to simultaneously perform nitrification and denitrification as well as p removal was named sndpr 01 the strain was a gram negative motile and short rod shaped bacterium with a size of 1 5 5 Î¼m 0 5 1 Î¼m fig 1 a it formed flat semi opaque smooth surfaced and irregular edged colonies on the solid medium interestingly the strain secreted a water soluble green pigment homology analysis on the partial 16s rrna sequence showed that the isolated strain was closely affiliated with pseudomonas aeruginosa 100 similarity this strain and the pseudomonas aeruginosa strain cneb25 formed a distinct cluster within a dendrogram away from other reported sndpr strains fig 1b according to a previous study pseudomonas aeruginosa could perform hn ad in wastewater treatment plants wei et al 2021 however the sndpr function of pseudomonas aeruginosa has not been reported 3 2 condition optimization a series of experiments were performed to optimize the conditions for sndpr performance and isolate growth the carbon source types influenced both sndpr performance and growth fig 2 a sodium citrate was the preferred carbon source resulting in the highest ammonium and phosphate removal efficiency more than 99 and biomass concentration od600 1 09 after 24 h culture although the phosphate removal efficiency pre did not significantly change when sodium citrate and sodium acetate were used as carbon sources p 0 05 the ammonium removal efficiency are significantly declined with the use of sodium acetate p 0 05 when sodium succinate glucose and saccharose were used as carbon sources ares and pres significantly decreased p 0 05 in comparison to the use of sodium acetate the growth of the isolate was also inhibited when saccharose and glucose were applied indicating that organic acid rather than sugar was the preferable carbon source for strain sndpr 01 similar results have been observed for pseudomonas stutzeri yg 24 li et al 2015 table 3 with the optimal carbon source sodium citrate the optimal c n ratio was achieved fig 2b both n and p removal efficiencies varied with c n ratios at ratios of 10 and 15 high nutrient removal was observed are of 95 and 97 pre of 94 and 93 respectively the od600 variation showed a tendency similar to that of nutrient removal low c n ratios 2 5 5 and a high c n ratio 20 inhibited bacterial growth consequently impeding the functions of the investigated strain strain sndpr 01 showed a moderate c n requirement similar to most reported sndpr bacteria table 3 the p n ratio had different effects on n and p removal fig 2c at values of 0 2 0 8 n removal was similar with an are above 97 in contrast an are of 82 was obtained at a p n ratio of 0 1 since the p concentration remained constant these results indicated an inhibition of n removal at high ammonium concentrations in contrast the highest pre 98 was found at a p n ratio of 0 1 indicating that the efficient removal of p is related to high ammonium concentrations isolate growth showed a consistent trend with pre the highest od600 of 1 04 was found at a p n ratio of 0 1 according to previous studies table 3 the optimal p n ratio for most sndpr bacteria is 0 1 0 2 indicating their preferences for low p and high n values to further explore the tolerance of strain sndpr 01 to ammonium different initial nh4 n concentrations with a p n ratio of 0 1 were tested fig 2d although the p in the influent varied with n the pre maintained relatively constant indicating that the initial p concentration does not considerably affect strain sndpr 01 in contrast the n removal rates at initial nh4 n concentrations of 150 300 mg l were significantly lower than those at 50 100 mg l p 0 05 indicating inhibition of the n removal function based on these results strain sndpr 01 can function at nh4 n concentrations below 100 mg l at 30 c the isolates showed the highest od600 value 0 91 as well as are 65 and pre 99 values fig 2e at 35 and 40 c ammonium and phosphate removal efficiencies of 60 or higher were achieved most sndpr strains showed optimal growth and nutrient removal efficiencies at 30 c table 3 strain sndpr 01 could tolerate a higher temperature than the other reported strains within a ph range of 5 5 9 5 strain sndpr 01 could survive and remove nutrients fig 2f at a ph of 7 5 the highest od600 value 0 85 and pre 95 were observed similar to those at ph 8 5 this optimal ph range of strain sndpr 01 is similar to that reported for most sndpr strains in table 3 in addition the variation trend of od600 with ph was in line with that of pre however with increasing ph values the are increased continuously from 34 to 54 3 3 phosphate removal mode fig 3 a shows the evolution of ammonium phosphate and cod under aerobic anaerobic aerobic conditions in the aerobic phase phosphate and ammonium in the solution significantly decreased with the growth of the isolate with the decrease in the cod concentration intracellular glycogen remained constant at the beginning of the first aerobic phase with some level of uncertainty due to the spike at 12 h from 12 to 28 h intracellular glycogen gradually decreased showing its use under insufficient substrate availability the intracellular pha in contrast was not stored in the subsequent anaerobic condition strain sndpr 01 did not assimilate ammonium and p and did not proliferate during the anaerobic phase the intracellular glycogen concentration decreased with reaction time whereas pha accumulation was not observed implying that glycogen was used for cell maintenance and survival after switching to aerobic conditions growth and nutrient removal were immediately resumed intracellular storage and nutrient removal were comparable to the first aerobic stage in the successive four aerobic cycles strain sndpr 01 constantly took up phosphate resulting in a stable p removal efficiency the results indicated that strain sndpr 01 retained its p metabolism in successive aerobic conditions along with the use of n and p proliferation of strain sndpr 01 was observed fig 3b in addition growth and nutrient removal were highly dependent on the do level and biomass as well as n and p removal performance increased linearly with increasing shaking speeds 0 160 rpm fig 3c based on these results strain sndpr 01 did not follow the p metabolism mode of paos under alternate anaerobic aerobic conditions in the aerobic stage paos excessively take up phosphate to synthesize intracellular poly phosphate poly p and accumulate glycogen comeau et al 1986 in the subsequent anaerobic stage paos hydrolyze poly p and glycogen to provide energy and reducing power for pha synthesis zhou et al 2010 in contrast phosphate release or glycogen hydrolysis did not occur under anaerobic conditions implying that strain sndpr 01 had a different p metabolism pathway in this regard the anaerobic phase is not a prerequisite for p metabolism in strain sndpr 01 aerobic p removal strains such as shewanella sp cf8 6 jiang et al 2018 arthrobacter sp hhep5 zhang et al 2020 and bacillus subtilis ghsp10 zhang et al 2021 have been described similar to strain sndpr 01 these strains performed phosphate removal under aerobic conditions although their p metabolism remains unknown 3 4 the sndpr ability and kinetics analysis strain sndpr 01 showed heterotrophic nitrification when ammonium was applied as the sole n source it was removed under aerobic conditions without nox accumulation during heterotrophic nitrification phosphate was degraded with a pre of 97 table 4 the concentrations of ammonium and phosphate increased in 24 32 h which could have been induced by bacterial mortality and cell lysis both ammonium and phosphate removal could be fitted well into the modified gompertz model r 2 0 98 fig 4 b the maximum ammonium degradation rate was 6 24 mg n l h and the maximum phosphate removal rate was 1 01 mg p l h both ammonium and phosphate were removed synchronously with a lag phase t0 of 4 64 h for ammonium and 4 51 h for phosphate when nitrite was applied as the sole n source it was completely removed by sndpr 01 fig 4c indicating a good aerobic nitrite removal performance the phosphate was also removed under aerobic conditions with a pre of 91 the removal of nitrite and phosphate could be well fitted into the modified gompertz model r 2 0 97 fig 4d the t0 of nitrite was 13 81 h over three times longer than that of ammonium in nitrification however the maximum nitrite removal rate was 14 72 mg n l h which was two times higher than the maximum ammonium removal rate in nitrification this indicated that nitrite could inhibit the activity of strain sndpr 01 after strain sndpr 01 had adapted to the high nitrite concentration it showed an excellent nitrite removal ability in addition phosphate removal was also inhibited by nitrite with a t0 of 7 55 h when nitrate was used as the sole n source the same significant removal efficiency was achieved fig 4e according to the fitting results of the modified gompertz model rm and t0 of nitrate were 7 23 mg n l h and 8 97 h r2 0 96 respectively during aerobic denitrification nitrite was accumulated with the maximum concentration of 12 7 mg n l which finally decreased to zero the temporary accumulation of nitrite indicated that nitrate was first transformed into nitrite also during aerobic denitrification a significant phosphate removal was observed comparing the results of three feedings ammonium nitrite and nitrate the lowest rm of phosphate was observed in adm 2 with nitrate as the sole n source table 4 suggesting that in strain sndpr 01 heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification are related to phosphate metabolism a similar phenomenon has been observed in sndpr strain pseudomonas stutzeri yg 24 li et al 2015 heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification are important energy metabolic pathways since they both follow a long pathway from ammonium to gaseous n the energy amount from ammonium removal is higher than that from nitrite or nitrate removal even denitrifying nitrite and nitrate could also result in different energy amounts kuypers et al 2018 therefore it is reasonable to infer that differences in energy supply lead to different p removal rates and efficiencies further studies are needed to verify this assumption when ammonium and nitrite were used as mixed n sources strain sndpr 01 decomposed ammonium and nitrite with the increase of biomass fig 4g ammonium and nitrite could be completely removed with rm values of 5 95 and 17 31 mg n l h respectively the t0 of nitrite 14 44 h was similar to that when nitrite was the sole n source the t0 of ammonium 9 25 h in the process was nearly twice as high as that obtained with the use of nitrite as the sole n source showing that nitrite could slow down ammonium degradation during the process the nitrate level was below 5 mg l and approached zero at the end of the batch experiment strain sndpr 01 showed simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd when ammonium and nitrate were used as the mixed n sources a similar snd phenomenon could be observed fig 4i during the process less than 6 30 mg n l of nitrite was accumulated similar to what was observed when nitrate was the sole n source fig 4e aerobic phosphate removal occurred during snd with rm values of 0 59 and 0 93 mg l h in sndm 1 and sndm 2 respectively the nutrient degradation during sndpr could be accurately characterized by the modified gompertz equation r 2 0 9 fig 4h and j 3 5 p distribution during hn ad during hn ad the p balance was established via calculating the tp in the solution cell membrane intracell areas and eps in all five feedings containing sole and mixed n sources the p distribution showed a similar trend fig 5 along with the growth of the investigated strain p in the solution was gradually converted into cell membrane intracell areas and eps at the end of the reaction 24 h of cultivation most of the p in solution had been incorporated into cellular biomass despite the different p removal efficiencies observed the p distribution in the cytoplasm cell membrane and eps was similar with approximately 10 19 of p in the cytoplasm 14 41 in the cell membrane and 37 46 in the eps this indicated that p in solution was mostly converted into eps and cell membrane which formed the p pool the differences in n composition could influence the p distribution when ammonium was used as the sole n source fig 5a the p content in the cell membrane pmembrane accounted for 41 which was slightly higher than that in eps 37 however when nitrite or nitrate were used as the sole n source fig 5b and c pmembrane 14 and 17 was significantly lower than peps 45 and 46 when ammonium was used as n source alongside nitrite or nitrate the p pooled in eps was increased this illustrated that aerobic denitrification might boost the p conversion into eps and that strain sndpr 01 pooled a considerable amount of p in eps or cell membrane during hn ad some aerobic p removal strains such as shewanella sp cf8 6 jiang et al 2018 and diutina rugosa bl3 sun et al 2021 also mainly accumulate phosphate in eps accounting for 60 70 the paos stored p intracellularly by up to 90 whereas the peps was approximately 5 9 zhang et al 2013 strain sndpr 01 showed the opposite p distribution in comparison to paos suggesting a novel p removal mechanism 3 6 p species within cells and eps of strain sndpr 01 to understand the p metabolic pathway of strain sndpr 01 it was essential to ascertain the species of p in the membrane cells and eps since the membrane was mainly composed of phospholipids the species of p in the membrane were not further determined according to the results of 31p nmr spectroscopy the signals of orthophosphate 6 504 ppm phosphate monoester 4 898 and 4 765 ppm and diester 1 637 ppm were observed inside the cells fig 6 a orthophosphate was the main p species within cells followed by phosphate monoester and diester different results were observed for diutina rugosa bl3 sun et al 2021 with five p species including orthophosphate phosphate monoester phosphate diester pyrophosphate and polyphosphate within cells it should be noted that 31p nmr spectroscopy did not show the existence of polyphosphate or pyrophosphate in strain sndpr 01 since the detection limit of 31p nmr for polyphosphate and pyrophosphate is relatively high the existence of polyphosphate and pyrophosphate needs to be verified by other methods herein we employed the detection of polyphosphate kinase ppk and exopolyphosphatase ppx which are responsible for catalyzing phosphate assimilation and polyphosphate hydrolysis in paos respectively li et al 2015 the successful amplification of ppk gene and ppx gene supports the assumption that strain sndpr 01 can synthesize polyphosphate via orthophosphate and hydrolyze polyphosphate to orthophosphate fig 6b only the signal of phosphate monoester 5 103 ppm 3 400 4 270 ppm was observed via 31p nmr spectroscopy of eps extracts fig 6a indicating that phosphate monoester was the sole p species in eps this finding is in agreement with previous observations jiang et al 2018 sun et al 2021 3 7 the hn ad pathway all functional genes amoa hao napa nirs cnorb and nosz genes could be amplified in our study fig s1 suggesting the presence of these genes in the genome of strain sndp 01 generally amoa encoded ammonia monooxygenase amo oxidizing nh4 n to nh2oh n whereas hao encoded hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao oxidizing nh2oh n to no2 n the napa encoded periplasmic nitrate reductase nap reducing no3 n to no2 n and nirs encoded nitrite reductase nir reducing no2 n to no the cnorb encoded nitric oxide reductase reducing no to n2o and nosz encoded nitrous oxide reductase reducing n2o to n2 although the nxr gene encoding nitrite oxygenase was not amplified nitrate could be detected when nitrite was used as the sole n source this illustrates the ability to oxidize nitrite to nitrate and allows the speculation that strain sndpr 01 followed the complete nitrification and denitrification pathway i e nh4 nh2oh no2 no3 no2 no n2o n2 the pathway of hn ad has been found in various bacteria such as bacillus cereus gs 5 and exiguobacterium mexicanum strain snd 01 rout et al 2017 cui et al 2021 the long n metabolism pathway could benefit energy generation 3 8 the hypothetic aerobic phosphate removal model combining the results the hypothetic aerobic phosphate removal model of strain sndpr 01was proposed to demonstrate p transportation and transformation fig 7 under strict aerobic conditions orthophosphate in solution can easily pass the eps matrix and be transported into cells through the phosphate transporters on the membrane zhang et al 2021 in the cytoplasm orthophosphate can be synthesized into membrane phospholipids polyphosphates and phosphate monoester and diester the mutual transformation of polyphosphate and orthophosphate is catalyzed by ppk and ppx which could serve as the energy generation pathway this transformation with a dynamic balance between hydrolysis and synthesis is rapid avoiding the accumulation of polyphosphate within cells in addition some of the intracellular orthophosphate could be synthesized into phosphate ester by phosphate kinase including phosphate monoester and diester phosphate monoesters are the main compounds of mononucleotides and inositol phosphates jorgensen et al 2011 in contrast phospholipids phosphonates ribonucleic acid rna and deoxyribonucleic acid dna are mainly composed of phosphate diesters jorgensen et al 2011 therefore the conversion of orthophosphate into phosphate monoesters and or diesters contributed to the synthesis of genetic material phosphate diester could also be degraded to orthophosphate by phosphatase or transformed into phosphate monoester when growth is limited su 2021 subsequently phosphate monoester can be hydrolyzed to orthophosphate by phosphatase vincent et al 1992 in addition phosphate monoester can be transported outside the cells because of their high affinity to the eps matrix jiang et al 2018 the hypothetic model has two issues one is the energy supply for p metabolism conventionally energy can be obtained via p metabolism the sole generated energy pathway is from hydrolysis of polyphosphate to orthophosphate in the model more energy is required for the synthesis of phospholipids phosphate monoesters and diesters in strain sndpr 01 which means that there is an energy gap in the model the relationship between hn ad and aerobic p removal infers that the energy needed for p metabolism is obtained via hn ad metabolism the other issue is related to the role of monoesters pooled in eps a large amount of removed phosphate accumulated in eps in the form of monoesters based on the experiments on continuous aerobic phosphate removal it is assumed that phosphate can persistently be removed and accumulated this phenomenon poses the question about the function of the phosphate monoesters accumulating in eps which requires further research 4 conclusions a novel strain pseudomonas aeruginosa sndpr 01 was isolated and its hnadpr ability was shown it performed efficient simultaneous n and p removal under the optimal conditions such as sodium citrate as carbon source c n ratio of 10 p n ratio of 0 1 initial ammonium concentration of 100 mg l temperature of 30 c and ph of 7 5 8 5 strain sndpr 01 could perform phosphate removal under strict aerobic conditions rather than alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions under heterotrophic and aerobic conditions strain sndpr 01 removed ammonium nitrite and nitrate without the accumulation of intermediate products it is assumed that strain sndpr 01 can perform the complete hn ad pathway based on the successful amplification of functional genes involved in hn ad with the removal of n phosphate was gradually transported into the cell membrane and eps orthophosphate and phosphate esters were the main p species in cells whereas phosphate monoester was the sole p species in eps a hypothetic model is proposed to present the possible aerobic phosphate removal pathway in strain sndpr 01
