term to the continuity equation and incorporating the corrective smoothed particle method cspm a modified boundary condition is implemented to better simulate the pressure field near the solid boundary the sph model is first verified by comparing the numerical results with analytical solutions and the available experimental data the verified model is then applied to study the hydrodynamic behaviour of an onshore oscillating water chamber the free surface elevations inside the water chamber and the total forces acting on the front wall of the water chamber are studied for different wave conditions the turbulence energy distribution and the sloshing phenomenon in the water chamber are also investigated keywords sph oscillating water chamber turbulence model wave structure interaction sloshing 1 introduction the oscillating water column owc devices are usually placed in the open sea with large waves and are often unprotected in order to maximize power generation it is therefore important to determine the hydrodynamic performance of the owc device under both normal operating conditions and its survivability during extreme conditions early theoretical models for studying the hydrodynamic performance of the owc device are usually based on the linear wave theory with the rigid body assumption the vertical motion of the water column in the chamber was assumed as a simple piston motion where the length of the water chamber was considered small compared to the incident wavelength evans 1978 first presented a theoretical model for the hydrodynamics of a fixed owc device based on the above assumptions in the original model the air pressure inside the chamber was treated as constant being equal to the atmospheric pressure since then the model has been extended by considering the influence of the air pressure and the deformation of the free surface in the chamber when the geometry of the water chamber was complex and the dimensions were not small compared to the incident wavelength the boundary element method bem was used to study the hydrodynamics of the owc device this included the work of count and evans 1984 who obtained a numerical solution for the fixed wave energy device with a harbour in front of the entrance of the water chamber and you 1993 who studied the influence of projecting sidewalls on the hydrodynamic performance of a wave power device using a 3d bem clement 1997 investigated the influence of the depth and shape of the front wall on the oscillating motion of the interior free surface delauré and lewis 2003 examined the suitability of the efficient hydrodynamic modelling for the generic bottom mounted owc device ning et al 2015 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of a fixed owc device using a higher order bem recently iturrioz et al 2014 presented a simplified time domain model based on the cummins equation cummins 1962 and validated their model with the experimental data of a fixed detached owc device in which the information taken from a frequency domain method was required to determine the coefficients of the state space system that approximated the convolution integral later armesto et al 2014 directly used the information obtained from the physical experiment or the computational fluid dynamics models to identify the coefficients of the state space system and studied the piston like movement of a floating owc device assuming that sloshing in the chamber was negligible the aforementioned methods are based on linear water wave theory and potential flow ignoring many important nonlinear effects such as those associated with the vortex shedding and turbulence at the chamber entrance as well as the large amplitude sloshing of the free surface inside the water chamber these nonlinear effects are important especially when the frequency of the incident wave is close to the natural frequency of the water chamber numerical models that directly solve the navier stokes n s equations have been used to study the performance of the owc device el marjani et al 2008 modelled the fluid motion inside the water chamber using the commercial fluent software zhang et al 2012 investigated the variation of the surface elevation and the air pressure in the water chamber using the level set immersed boundary method teixeira et al 2013 studied the impact of geometric parameters on energy efficiency using the fluinco model iturrioz et al 2015 simulated a fixed device to test the capability of openfoam in solving the owc device hydrodynamics the grid based numerical models although powerful may have difficulty dealing with extremely large deformation problems and usually also require an explicit surface capturing scheme in comparison the mesh free sph method is more accurate for treating strong nonlinear flows and modelling coastal structures with complex boundary geometries that are most representative of the operation environments of the owc devices since monaghan 1994 pioneered the sph method for simulating a simple dam break problem the method has been successfully applied to a wide range of fluid mechanics problems dalrymple and rogers 2006 gomez gesteira 2004 shao and lo 2003 shi et al 2017 wen et al 2016 and fluid structure interaction problems including wave interaction with caisson breakwaters omidvar et al 2013 rogers et al 2010 floating bodies bouscasse et al 2013 omidvar et al 2013 ren et al 2015a and permeable structures akbari and namin 2013 ren et al 2014 2015b shao 2010 more recently by ignoring the air motion in the water chamber didier et al 2016 tentatively studied the hydrodynamics of a simple owc device using the standard sph method and crespo et al 2017 applied dualsphysics to simulate wave interaction with a floating offshore owc device the turbulence effect which is important at the water chamber entrance is neglected in both didier et al s 2016 and crespo et al s 2017 models in this study the hydrodynamics of an owc device without a power take off system which may be more appropriately be referred to as an oscillating water chamber are studied using an improved sph turbulent model ignoring the effect of the air motion in the water chamber the accuracy of the model is enhanced by introducing a pressure smoothing scheme and the improved sph model is verified by comparing with analytical solutions for a standing wave impacting a vertical wall and with the experimental results for wave interaction with a fixed offshore oscillating water chamber finally the verified sph model is applied to the study of the hydrodynamics of an onshore oscillating water chamber 2 the sph model 2 1 the sph approximation in the sph method the state of a system is represented by a set of particles that interact with each other within their support domain a given field function and its spatial derivatives f and f are evaluated in the following discrete form through the kernel and particle approximations 1 f i j 1 n m j ρ j f j w i j 2 f i j 1 n m j ρ j f j i w i j where n is the total number of particles within the support domain of particle i m j and ρ j are the mass and density associated with neighbouring particle j in eqs 1 and 2 w i j and i w i j are the kernel function and its derivatives respectively to overcome the problem that the original kernel function is unable to satisfy the normalization and symmetry conditions for the boundary particles and or the irregularly distributed particles the cspm proposed by chen et al 1999 is implemented in the present model in the cspm method the modified kernel function and its derivatives i e w i j and i w i j can be written as 3 w i j w i j j 1 n m j ρ j w i j 4 i w i j i w i j j 1 n m j ρ j r j r i i w i j where is the tensor product r i and r j are the position vectors corresponding to the particles i and j respectively the quintic kernel introduced by wendland 1995 provides a higher order interpolation at a moderate computational cost and is chosen as the kernel function in the present model 5 w r h 7 4 π h 2 1 q 2 4 2 q 1 0 q 2 where q r h h is the smoothing length and r is the distance between the neighbouring particles 2 2 governing equations in this study the fluid is assumed to be weakly compressible the large eddy simulation les equations that govern the filtered fluid motion are written as 6 d ρ d t ρ u 7 d u d t 1 ρ p g υ υ t 2 u where u is the filtered velocity vector p is the filtered pressure ρ is the filtered fluid density and g is the gravitational acceleration υ and υ t are the molecular viscosity of water 10 6 m2 s and the turbulence eddy viscosity respectively the smagorinsky model is used to determine the turbulence eddy viscosity 8 ν t c s d x 2 s where c s is the smagorinsky constant and is equal to 0 1 and dx is the particle spacing s 2 s c d s c d 1 2 and s c d 1 2 u c x d u d x c where c and d refer to spatial coordinates in the present model instead of solving the poisson equation the pressure is calculated explicitly by solving the following equation of state 9 p b ρ ρ 0 7 1 where ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 is the reference density the parameter b can be taken as b c 0 2 ρ 0 7 where c 0 is the speed of sound at the reference density and its value must be at least ten times greater than the maximum fluid velocity to keep density variations less than 1 monaghan 1994 in the present model an explicit second order symplectic scheme with an accuracy in time of o dt 2 is applied this integration algorithm is time reversible in the absence of friction or viscous effects and can preserve a high resolution long term simulation leimkuhler and patrick 1996 a variable time step dt is used according to monaghan and kos 1999 which is dependent on the courant friedrich levy condition the force term and the viscous diffusion term the improved model is implemented based on the open source parallel sphysics code it is well known that the weakly compressible scheme results in spurious numerical pressure oscillations different approaches have been proposed through adding a diffusive term into the continuity equation to reduce the spurious numerical noise ferrari et al 2009 suggested a diffusive term based on the theory of riemann solvers and obtained a smoothed pressure but it could not conserve the total volume of the fluid system antuono et al 2012 also presented a diffusive term that was proven to be effective at smoothing out the spurious oscillations and could conserve the fluid volume however this treatment is time consuming because it needs to calculate the renormalized density gradient beforehand in the present model the diffusive term is written as 10 ψ i ξ h c 0 j 1 n m j ρ j ρ j f ρ i r i j i w i j r i j 2 0 1 h 2 11 ρ j f ρ 0 p j ρ j g r i j b 1 1 7 where the coefficient ξ controls the diffusion intensity and is set to 0 1 for all the considered simulations following marrone et al 2011 this term does not affect the global evolution of the fluid and only acts as a smoothing process for the pressure field by writing eqs 6 and 7 in sph form the governing equations for particle i become 12 d ρ i d t ρ i j 1 n m j ρ j u i u j i w i j ψ i 13 d u i d t j 1 n m j p i ρ i 2 p j ρ j 2 i w i j g j 1 n 4 υ υ t m j r i j i w i j u i u j ρ i ρ j r i j 2 0 1 h 2 2 3 boundary conditions 2 3 1 the solid boundary condition the solid boundary particles have a truncated support domain due to the absence of neighbouring particles therefore the conditions of consistency and normalization fail for the boundary particles to overcome this problem the modified dynamic boundary condition dbc by ren et al 2014 is adopted the solid boundaries are treated as two layers of boundary particles that follow the continuity equation and equation of state but not the momentum equation crespo et al 2007 the pressure of solid boundary particle p k is calculated by the following equations 14 p k β p k f 1 β p k 15 p k f j 1 n m j ρ j p j w r k j h 16 p j p j ρ j g r k j where j represents the fluid particle in the support of boundary particle k p k f is the pressure of the boundary k calculated by the interpolation of the fluid particles in its support domain p k is the pressure of boundary particle k calculated according to the equation of state β 0 7 is adopted in the present simulations based on extensive calibration tests a detail discussion of the value of β can be found in ren et al 2014 2 3 2 the wavemaker boundary condition the wavemaker boundary is simulated as a moving plate the treatments of wavemaker particles are the same as those of fixed boundary particles except that their positions are updated according to a given wavemaker function the movement of the wavemaker generates the required incident wave and absorbs the reflected wave at the same time according to gao 2011 the horizontal velocity of the absorbing wavemaker can be expressed as 17 u t d x 0 d t ω φ 2 η 0 η where x 0 and ω are the amplitude and frequency of the wavemaker movement respectively η 0 is the target water surface elevation and η is the local water surface elevation φ is the transfer function and can be written as 18 φ 4 sinh 2 k d 2 k d sinh 2 k d where k is the wave number and d is the water depth it is worth mentioning that the generated waves are rather sensitive to the value of η 3 verification of the sph model this section is to verify the performance of the sph model by comparing the simulated results with the analytical results and the available experimental data all the simulations shown in this paper are completed at the supercomputing center of the chinese academy of sciences each blade node contains two ten core intel xeon e5 2680 v2 processors with a clock speed of 2 8 ghz and 64 0 gb ram in addition a uniform particle spacing dx 1 0 cm and a constant smoothing length h 1 5dx are used in the present section the performance of the diffusive term added to the continuity equation is tested using a simple hydrostatic problem a 2d tank partially filled with water at rest the tank width is 1 0 m and the water depth is 0 5 m the particle distributions of the sph model with the present diffusive term are shown in fig 1 the simulated results with the diffusive terms adopted by ferrari et al 2009 and antuono et al 2012 are also displayed in fig 1 as a comparison the dashed blue line in this figure represents the initial water level from fig 1 it can be seen that a smoothing pressure field is obtained using any of the three schemes of the diffusive term whereas for ferrari et al s 2009 model the fluid particles tend to move upwards and the hydrostatic solution is completely misinterpreted the unphysical rising process of the free surface is also displayed in fig 2 conversely antuono et al s 2012 model and the present model can conserve the total volume of the fluid system well the present sph model can obtain the same accuracy as antuono et al s 2012 model in addition another 2d tank is used to test the computational cost of the present model and antuono s model the tank is modelled using 81 509 particles with an initial particle space of 0 0045 m the simulation time is 1 0 s and the computational times on the single 3 4 ghz intel i7 6800k core with 16 gb ram are approximately 291 min and 363 min for the present model and antuono s model respectively the present model gives a reduction in the computational time of approximately 19 8 as it does not need to calculate the renormalized density gradient beforehand the performance of the present sph model is then examined for wave generation and wave propagation as shown in fig 3 a the initial water depth is 0 5 m and the computational domain is 15 m long with an active absorbing wavemaker at the left end and an artificial viscosity sponge layer at the right end of the flume fig 4 shows the particle distribution and the pressure field near the wave maker using the original and modified dbc respectively an unphysical separation between the fluid particles and the boundary particles can be observed obviously near the free surface using the original dbc this separation phenomenon will lead to an error of the instantaneous free surface near the wave maker which is important for the active absorbing wavemaker used in the present model fig 5 displays the comparisons of the time series of the dynamic pressure at the bottom boundary and the results show that the pressure by the modified dbc is more in agreement with the second order stokes wave theory fig 6 gives the comparisons of the fluid particle distribution and the pressure field between the present and original sph model the artificial viscosity proposed by monaghan 1994 is considered in the original sph model to describe the diffusive term and the relevant parameters are set to α 0 03 and β 0 0 as seen in fig 6 the pressure oscillations generally occur in the original sph model computational domain in addition because the particles near the free surface have a truncated support domain a separation between the free surface particles and the adjacent particles at the wave crest can be observed in the original sph model fig 7 gives the comparisons of the temporal variation of the free surface pressure calculated from the original and present sph models the averaged value of the free surface pressure calculated from the present model is 26 pa whereas the value from the original model is 134 pa therefore the present model can better satisfy the free surface conditions than the original model the comparisons of the sph results and the analytical results in terms of the free surface elevations at different locations are shown in fig 8 as seen in this figure the results of the present sph model are in good agreement with the analytical results of the second order stokes wave whereas the wave height of the original sph model seriously decreases due to excessive wave energy dissipation during wave propagation the sph model is further verified by simulating the wave force and torque acting on a fully reflective vertical wall the analytical solution proposed by sainflou 1928 is used as a reference to assess the standing wave loads sainflou 1928 formula is theoretically derived for a fully reflective vertical wall based on the assumption of the linear pressure distribution and it can accurately predict the wave force when the relative depth d l is in the range of 0 1 0 15 the numerical model for a standing wave acting on a fully reflective vertical wall is shown in fig 3 b the wave flume is 8 66 m long with an active absorbing wavemaker at the left end and a vertical wall at the right end of the flume the wave period is 1 95 s and the initial water depth is 0 6 m the six different wave heights shown in table 1 are simulated the subscripts c and t refer to the instants of the wave crest and wave trough respectively the hydrodynamic force and the corresponding torque acting on the vertical wall under different wave conditions are calculated and compared with sainflou s 1928 solution as shown in table 1 the predicted wave force and the corresponding torque by the sph model agree well with the analytical solution and the maximum error is less than 6 as stated above the pressure is calculated explicitly by solving the equation of state rather than the poisson equation in the weakly compressible sph model therefore a small density oscillation will generate a large pressure variation the spurious pressure oscillations are responsible for the errors between the sph model and the analytical solution although the pressure oscillations are lightened by adding a diffusive term into the continuity equation in the present model this error is acceptable for the weakly compressible sph model considering the predicted sph results relating to wave interaction with coastal structures by other researchers didier et al 2014 fig 9 and fig 10 give the comparisons of the hydrodynamic force and the corresponding torque between the numerical and analytical results for different wave conditions described in table 1 the correlations between the sph results and sainflou s predictions are all larger than 0 95 fig 11 gives the time series of the free surface elevations at the nodes and the antinodes for standing waves it can be observed that the amplitude of the standing wave is about twice the target value at the antinodes and is approximately 0 at the nodes which indicates the active wavemaker can absorb the re reflected waves at the wavemaker boundary the performance of the sph model is further examined by simulating wave interaction with an offshore oscillating water chamber and the simulated results are compared with iturrioz et al s 2015 experimental results as shown in fig 3 c the numerical wave flume is 15 0 m and the initial water depth is 0 6 m an active absorbing wavemaker is placed at the left end of the flume and an artificial viscosity sponge layer is set at the right end of the tank to absorb the transmitted wave a fixed and offshore oscillating water chamber is placed 5 4 m from the wavemaker the distance between the water chamber front and back walls is 0 3 m and the submerged depth is 0 2 m as shown in fig 3 c following the setup of iturrioz et al s 2015 physical experiment nine wave gauges were placed along the flume for analysing the free surface elevation outside and inside the water chamber as seen in fig 3 c four wave gauges were placed in the seaside of the structure one wave gauge was placed in the middle of the water chamber and four additional wave gauges were installed in the leeside of the structure the corresponding coordinates of wave gauges are listed in table 2 in this work the simulation is conducted with incoming regular waves of t 1 3 s 1 7 s and h 0 08 m and with a top opening of 0 05 m following iturrioz et al s 2015 statement the air pressure in the chamber is negligible when the top opening is 0 05 m and then the present single phase sph model without a power take off system can be implemented to predict the fluid motion around the water chamber the computational domain is modelled using approximately 124 000 particles the simulated time is set to 20 s and the computational time with 12 cpus is approximately 6 h fig 12 and fig 13 give the comparisons of the free surface elevations outside and inside the chamber between the sph results and the corresponding experimental data of iturrioz et al 2015 respectively as shown in these figures a good agreement between the numerical and experimental results is obtained both in terms of the wave amplitude and the non linear process of wave evolution around the chamber a partial standing wave pattern is developed on the seaside of the chamber caused by the wave reflection and the amplitude of the transmitted wave is slightly smaller than the incident wave from the comparisons between the sph results and the analytical results as well as the available experimental data it can be found that the present sph model performs well for simulating wave transformation and the wave force acting on coastal structures 4 numerical simulation of an onshore oscillating water chamber in this section the verified sph model is used to study the hydrodynamics of a simple oscillating water chamber under wave action it is worthwhile to emphasize that the hydrodynamics of the oscillating water chamber are characterized by the complicated dynamic process of vortex formation and dying out numerical simulation of such a process relies on an advanced turbulence model which is known to be difficult with classical sph models the computational setup is shown in fig 14 an active absorbing wavemaker is placed at the left end of the flume and an oscillating water chamber is positioned at the right end of the flume the main objective of this study is to study the hydrodynamics of the oscillating water chamber and the effect of the air motion is ignored in the chamber the initial water depth d is 0 5 m the relative wave height h d varies from 0 12 to 0 24 and the relative front wall depth h c d varies from 0 2 to 0 7 three different water chambers of 0 12 m 0 32 m and 0 52 m long are simulated respectively the wave period is in the range of 0 9 3 0 s an initial particle spacing of dx 1 0 cm is used for all the cases and the computational domain is modelled using nearly 51 000 particles the simulated time is set to 20 s and the computational time with 10 cpus is approximately 4 h 4 1 effect of incident wave height fig 15 and fig 16 show the comparisons of the free surface elevations outside and inside the chamber for different wave heights figure a represents the time series of the outside gauges that are 0 15 m away from the front wall of the water chamber and figure b represents the time series of the inside gauges in the middle of the chamber the vof results calculated by commercial fluent software are used to compare with the sph results as a reference the fluent simulations are carried out with the segregated solver and the standard k ω turbulence model the simplec algorithm is used for coupling pressure and velocity a vof algorithm is applied for capturing the free surface a non slip condition is imposed on the fixed boundaries and wave generation is simulated by imposing the velocity components and volume fraction on the wavemaker boundary grid spaces of dx 0 04 m and dz 0 025 m are used and the time step is set as t 600 from figs 15 and 16 it can be seen that the free surface elevations calculated by the sph model and by the fluent code are in good agreement in general although there are some differences especially for the free surface elevation inside the chamber it can also be seen that the time series of the free surface elevations by the sph model have better stability and reproducibility a detailed description of the complex velocity field and the distribution of the normalized turbulence eddy viscosity υ t υ υ 10 6 m 2 s near the chamber is given in fig 17 at four instants during one wave period the four instants correspond to the wave crest the zero down crossing the wave trough and the zero up crossing inside the water chamber the velocity field has been plotted by mapping the individual particle velocities onto a fixed grid of 2 cm 2 cm using the interpolations of the sph kernel the information of turbulence eddy viscosity is used to infer the behaviour of turbulence intensity as the sub particle scale sps which is analogous to the definition of the sub grid scale in mesh based models turbulent kinetic energy can be approximately related to the turbulence eddy viscosity by a turbulent constant in fig 17 a at t t 0 0 the free surface elevation inside the water chamber reaches the maximum value an anticlockwise vortex is observed at the entry of the chamber which is formed due to the high velocity near the front wall the turbulence energy is concentrated on the bottom end of the front wall in the chamber in fig 17 b at t t 0 25 the free surface inside the water chamber is down crossing the initial water level the water particles in the chamber move downwards with large velocity and then return to the open sea through the water chamber entry where the turbulence is obviously stronger in fig 17 c at t t 0 5 the free surface elevation inside the water chamber reaches the minimum value the velocity intensity is weak inside the water chamber and a clockwise rotation vortex is noticed at the bottom end of the front wall outside the chamber the turbulence energy is mainly distributed around the water chamber entry in fig 17 d at t t 0 75 the free surface inside the water chamber is up crossing the initial water level an intense water flux from the outside to the inside of the chamber can be observed at the water chamber entry and the water particles in the chamber move upwards with high velocity a stronger turbulence zone is formed at the water chamber entry as seen in fig 17 significant variation of velocity can be observed along the vertical wall to the chamber entry due to the periodic water flux exchange between the fluid particles inside and outside the water chamber in addition the stronger turbulence energy is distributed around the entry of the chamber where the vortices are periodically generated convected and destroyed wave energy loss induced by vortex shedding at the water chamber entry can be estimated by the total energy dissipation as there is not a power take off system installed in the present model fig 18 gives the reflection coefficients and the total wave energy dissipation coefficients for different wave periods the total energy dissipation is evaluated from the measured reflection coefficient and can be calculated by 19 c d 1 c r 2 where c d and c r are the energy dissipation coefficient and the reflection coefficient as seen in fig 18 the energy dissipation coefficient first increases and then decreases with increasing wave period and the trend of the reflection coefficient is opposite as expected the maximal value of c d is approximately 0 9 at t 1 5 s indicating that the maximal energy extraction efficiency is not more than 0 9 for the present structure form fig 19 displays the relative wave heights inside the chamber for different incident wave heights the relative wave height is defined as the ratio of the average wave height inside the chamber h av to the incident wave height h h av is defined as the change of the volume inside the chamber divided by the water chamber length to eliminate the influence of the free surface sloshing as seen in fig 19 the maximum value of the relative wave height h av h is approximately 1 0 for the wave period of 1 2 s whereas it is up to 1 9 for the wave period of 1 5 s which is close to the natural period of the water chamber for both of the wave periods the relative wave height decreases with the increase of the incident wave height because the interactions between the incident wave and the chamber are more complex and wave energy dissipation is more intensive for the higher wave height since the operation environment of the owc device is usually very severe it is important to investigate the forces acting on the front vertical wall of the water chamber for design purpose the time series of the total forces acting on the front wall is shown in fig 20 the forces are defined positive in the wave propagation direction as seen in fig 20 the forces increase as wave height increases and their maximum values are approximately 260 n and 300 n for wave periods of 1 2 s and 1 5 s respectively the wave force acting on the front vertical wall is caused by the difference of wave run ups between the two sides of the front wall fig 21 gives the time series of wave run ups on the outside and inside of the front wall as shown in this figure although the run ups on the outside and inside of the front wall for the case of t 1 2 s are much different from that of t 1 5 s their differences between the outside and inside of the wall for this two cases do not differ so much this is caused by the fact that the time series of wave run ups on the outside and inside of the front wall have different phase differences for different wave periods 4 2 effect of wave period fig 22 shows the relative wave height inside the water chamber for different wave periods as observed in fig 22 the relative wave height inside the chamber is almost half of the incident wave height for t 1 0 s and increases with the wave period until t 1 8 s the average wave height almost stabilizes at h av being about twice the incident wave height the time series of the total forces acting on the front vertical wall for different wave periods are displayed in fig 23 as seen in this figure the time series of the forces are no longer the standard cosine curves for the larger wave periods because the interactions between the incident wave and the water chamber are more complex with the increase of wave period it can also be seen that the peak value of the force is slightly larger than the magnitude of the trough value for the wave period of 1 2 s whereas the peak value is obviously smaller that the magnitude of the trough value for the wave period of 2 4 s due to the differences of the free surface elevations on the outside and inside of the front wall for different wave periods as shown in fig 22 4 3 effect of submerged depth fig 24 gives the fluid particle distribution inside and outside the water chamber for different submerged depths of the front wall at four instants during one wave period the front wall depth is 0 35 m for the left column 0 25 m for the middle column and 0 15 m for the right column as shown in fig 24 the complexity of wave interaction with the water chamber increases with the decrease of the front wall depth for the front wall depths of 0 35 m and 0 25 m the free surface elevations inside the chamber can be viewed as a horizontal plane whereas for the front wall depth of 0 15 m the incident wave interacts strongly with the front wall and a sloshing phenomenon can be observed inside the water chamber the sloshing phenomena inside the chamber have been observed by a series of the physical experiments and other numerical models davyt et al 2010 he and huang 2016 the transmitted waves through the front wall first reflect at the back wall of the chamber and part of the reflected waves are reflected back by the front wall resulting in multiple reflections inside the chamber the complicated interactions among the incident and multiple reflected waves may produce a sloshing phenomenon in the chamber liu et al 2010 for a detailed discussion of the sloshing phenomenon inside the water chamber fig 25 displays the time series of the sloshing parameter for different front wall depths the sloshing parameter is defined as s z f z r h where z f and z r are the free surface elevations at the front wall and the rear wall of the chamber respectively from fig 25 it can be seen that the sloshing phenomenon is nearly negligible when hc 0 35 m and there is a slight disturbance when hc 0 25 m the sloshing phenomena becomes obvious when hc 0 1 m and 0 15 m the frequency of the sloshing parameter is about twice the incident wave frequency in agreement with the conclusion of davyt et al 2010 in these cases the length of the water chamber is 0 32 m and the natural lowest frequency of the fluid inside the water chamber is nearly twice the incident wave frequency that is in the simulation the incoming wave is the 2 nd stokes wave and the component of the double frequency induces the horizontal sloshing of the fluid in the chamber when hc 0 1 m and 0 15 m whereas the antisymmetric sloshing mode is suppressed when hc 0 25 m and 0 35 m in these situations the ratio between the chamber length and the immersion depth is small and the inside water column can be considered as a rigid piston rezanejad et al 2013 therefore the internal free surfaces in these cases are nearly undisturbed and the piston like water columns oscillate only in the vertical direction 4 4 effect of chamber length fig 26 gives the relative wave height inside different chamber lengths from fig 26 it can be observed that the relative wave height increases with the decrease of the water chamber length the relative wave height inside the chamber is smaller than half of the incident wave height for all the three different chamber lengths when t 0 9 s and they increase with the wave period until t 1 4 s t 1 8 s and t 2 4 s for the water chamber lengths of 12 cm 32 cm and 52 cm respectively it can also be seen that the stabilized values of h av are approximately 2 5 2 0 and 1 5 times the incident wave height for water chamber lengths of 12 cm 32 cm and 52 cm respectively 5 conclusions an improved sph turbulent model is developed to study the hydrodynamics of an oscillating water chamber for a hydrostatic problem the predicted results indicate that the presented pressure smoothing scheme can well conserve the total volume of the fluid system and smooth out the spurious pressure oscillation at relatively low computational costs the predicted wave force and torque for the standing wave acting on a fully reflective vertical wall agree with the analytical solutions and the free surface elevations outside and inside the offshore oscillating water chamber compare well with the corresponding experimental results for wave interaction with the onshore oscillating water chamber the numerical results show that the present sph model can reproduce the free surface elevations both outside and inside the water chamber the processes of vortex generation convection and dying out are also well captured the peak value of the wave force acting on the front wall is slightly greater than the valley values for smaller wave period whereas the peak value is obviously smaller than the valley value for larger wave period due to the differences of the free surface elevations on the outside and inside of the front wall in addition the complexity of wave interaction with the water chamber increases with the decrease of the front wall depth the surface elevation inside the chamber can be seen as a plane for a bigger value of the front wall depth whereas a sloshing phenomenon can be observed inside the water chamber for a smaller value of the front wall depth all the results obtained show that the present sph model can well reproduce the hydrodynamics of the oscillating water chamber future development may have to include the effect of the air motion in the water chamber by further extending the capacity of the sph model acknowledgements this work was supported by ng teng fong charitable foundation through tsinghua university education foundation tuef the

behaviour of an onshore oscillating water chamber the free surface elevations inside the water chamber and the total forces acting on the front wall of the water chamber are studied for different wave conditions the turbulence energy distribution and the sloshing phenomenon in the water chamber are also investigated keywords sph oscillating water chamber turbulence model wave structure interaction sloshing 1 introduction the oscillating water column owc devices are usually placed in the open sea with large waves and are often unprotected in order to maximize power generation it is therefore important to determine the hydrodynamic performance of the owc device under both normal operating conditions and its survivability during extreme conditions early theoretical models for studying the hydrodynamic performance of the owc device are usually based on the linear wave theory with the rigid body assumption the vertical motion of the water column in the chamber was assumed as a simple piston motion where the length of the water chamber was considered small compared to the incident wavelength evans 1978 first presented a theoretical model for the hydrodynamics of a fixed owc device based on the above assumptions in the original model the air pressure inside the chamber was treated as constant being equal to the atmospheric pressure since then the model has been extended by considering the influence of the air pressure and the deformation of the free surface in the chamber when the geometry of the water chamber was complex and the dimensions were not small compared to the incident wavelength the boundary element method bem was used to study the hydrodynamics of the owc device this included the work of count and evans 1984 who obtained a numerical solution for the fixed wave energy device with a harbour in front of the entrance of the water chamber and you 1993 who studied the influence of projecting sidewalls on the hydrodynamic performance of a wave power device using a 3d bem clement 1997 investigated the influence of the depth and shape of the front wall on the oscillating motion of the interior free surface delauré and lewis 2003 examined the suitability of the efficient hydrodynamic modelling for the generic bottom mounted owc device ning et al 2015 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of a fixed owc device using a higher order bem recently iturrioz et al 2014 presented a simplified time domain model based on the cummins equation cummins 1962 and validated their model with the experimental data of a fixed detached owc device in which the information taken from a frequency domain method was required to determine the coefficients of the state space system that approximated the convolution integral later armesto et al 2014 directly used the information obtained from the physical experiment or the computational fluid dynamics models to identify the coefficients of the state space system and studied the piston like movement of a floating owc device assuming that sloshing in the chamber was negligible the aforementioned methods are based on linear water wave theory and potential flow ignoring many important nonlinear effects such as those associated with the vortex shedding and turbulence at the chamber entrance as well as the large amplitude sloshing of the free surface inside the water chamber these nonlinear effects are important especially when the frequency of the incident wave is close to the natural frequency of the water chamber numerical models that directly solve the navier stokes n s equations have been used to study the performance of the owc device el marjani et al 2008 modelled the fluid motion inside the water chamber using the commercial fluent software zhang et al 2012 investigated the variation of the surface elevation and the air pressure in the water chamber using the level set immersed boundary method teixeira et al 2013 studied the impact of geometric parameters on energy efficiency using the fluinco model iturrioz et al 2015 simulated a fixed device to test the capability of openfoam in solving the owc device hydrodynamics the grid based numerical models although powerful may have difficulty dealing with extremely large deformation problems and usually also require an explicit surface capturing scheme in comparison the mesh free sph method is more accurate for treating strong nonlinear flows and modelling coastal structures with complex boundary geometries that are most representative of the operation environments of the owc devices since monaghan 1994 pioneered the sph method for simulating a simple dam break problem the method has been successfully applied to a wide range of fluid mechanics problems dalrymple and rogers 2006 gomez gesteira 2004 shao and lo 2003 shi et al 2017 wen et al 2016 and fluid structure interaction problems including wave interaction with caisson breakwaters omidvar et al 2013 rogers et al 2010 floating bodies bouscasse et al 2013 omidvar et al 2013 ren et al 2015a and permeable structures akbari and namin 2013 ren et al 2014 2015b shao 2010 more recently by ignoring the air motion in the water chamber didier et al 2016 tentatively studied the hydrodynamics of a simple owc device using the standard sph method and crespo et al 2017 applied dualsphysics to simulate wave interaction with a floating offshore owc device the turbulence effect which is important at the water chamber entrance is neglected in both didier et al s 2016 and crespo et al s 2017 models in this study the hydrodynamics of an owc device without a power take off system which may be more appropriately be referred to as an oscillating water chamber are studied using an improved sph turbulent model ignoring the effect of the air motion in the water chamber the accuracy of the model is enhanced by introducing a pressure smoothing scheme and the improved sph model is verified by comparing with analytical solutions for a standing wave impacting a vertical wall and with the experimental results for wave interaction with a fixed offshore oscillating water chamber finally the verified sph model is applied to the study of the hydrodynamics of an onshore oscillating water chamber 2 the sph model 2 1 the sph approximation in the sph method the state of a system is represented by a set of particles that interact with each other within their support domain a given field function and its spatial derivatives f and f are evaluated in the following discrete form through the kernel and particle approximations 1 f i j 1 n m j ρ j f j w i j 2 f i j 1 n m j ρ j f j i w i j where n is the total number of particles within the support domain of particle i m j and ρ j are the mass and density associated with neighbouring particle j in eqs 1 and 2 w i j and i w i j are the kernel function and its derivatives respectively to overcome the problem that the original kernel function is unable to satisfy the normalization and symmetry conditions for the boundary particles and or the irregularly distributed particles the cspm proposed by chen et al 1999 is implemented in the present model in the cspm method the modified kernel function and its derivatives i e w i j and i w i j can be written as 3 w i j w i j j 1 n m j ρ j w i j 4 i w i j i w i j j 1 n m j ρ j r j r i i w i j where is the tensor product r i and r j are the position vectors corresponding to the particles i and j respectively the quintic kernel introduced by wendland 1995 provides a higher order interpolation at a moderate computational cost and is chosen as the kernel function in the present model 5 w r h 7 4 π h 2 1 q 2 4 2 q 1 0 q 2 where q r h h is the smoothing length and r is the distance between the neighbouring particles 2 2 governing equations in this study the fluid is assumed to be weakly compressible the large eddy simulation les equations that govern the filtered fluid motion are written as 6 d ρ d t ρ u 7 d u d t 1 ρ p g υ υ t 2 u where u is the filtered velocity vector p is the filtered pressure ρ is the filtered fluid density and g is the gravitational acceleration υ and υ t are the molecular viscosity of water 10 6 m2 s and the turbulence eddy viscosity respectively the smagorinsky model is used to determine the turbulence eddy viscosity 8 ν t c s d x 2 s where c s is the smagorinsky constant and is equal to 0 1 and dx is the particle spacing s 2 s c d s c d 1 2 and s c d 1 2 u c x d u d x c where c and d refer to spatial coordinates in the present model instead of solving the poisson equation the pressure is calculated explicitly by solving the following equation of state 9 p b ρ ρ 0 7 1 where ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 is the reference density the parameter b can be taken as b c 0 2 ρ 0 7 where c 0 is the speed of sound at the reference density and its value must be at least ten times greater than the maximum fluid velocity to keep density variations less than 1 monaghan 1994 in the present model an explicit second order symplectic scheme with an accuracy in time of o dt 2 is applied this integration algorithm is time reversible in the absence of friction or viscous effects and can preserve a high resolution long term simulation leimkuhler and patrick 1996 a variable time step dt is used according to monaghan and kos 1999 which is dependent on the courant friedrich levy condition the force term and the viscous diffusion term the improved model is implemented based on the open source parallel sphysics code it is well known that the weakly compressible scheme results in spurious numerical pressure oscillations different approaches have been proposed through adding a diffusive term into the continuity equation to reduce the spurious numerical noise ferrari et al 2009 suggested a diffusive term based on the theory of riemann solvers and obtained a smoothed pressure but it could not conserve the total volume of the fluid system antuono et al 2012 also presented a diffusive term that was proven to be effective at smoothing out the spurious oscillations and could conserve the fluid volume however this treatment is time consuming because it needs to calculate the renormalized density gradient beforehand in the present model the diffusive term is written as 10 ψ i ξ h c 0 j 1 n m j ρ j ρ j f ρ i r i j i w i j r i j 2 0 1 h 2 11 ρ j f ρ 0 p j ρ j g r i j b 1 1 7 where the coefficient ξ controls the diffusion intensity and is set to 0 1 for all the considered simulations following marrone et al 2011 this term does not affect the global evolution of the fluid and only acts as a smoothing process for the pressure field by writing eqs 6 and 7 in sph form the governing equations for particle i become 12 d ρ i d t ρ i j 1 n m j ρ j u i u j i w i j ψ i 13 d u i d t j 1 n m j p i ρ i 2 p j ρ j 2 i w i j g j 1 n 4 υ υ t m j r i j i w i j u i u j ρ i ρ j r i j 2 0 1 h 2 2 3 boundary conditions 2 3 1 the solid boundary condition the solid boundary particles have a truncated support domain due to the absence of neighbouring particles therefore the conditions of consistency and normalization fail for the boundary particles to overcome this problem the modified dynamic boundary condition dbc by ren et al 2014 is adopted the solid boundaries are treated as two layers of boundary particles that follow the continuity equation and equation of state but not the momentum equation crespo et al 2007 the pressure of solid boundary particle p k is calculated by the following equations 14 p k β p k f 1 β p k 15 p k f j 1 n m j ρ j p j w r k j h 16 p j p j ρ j g r k j where j represents the fluid particle in the support of boundary particle k p k f is the pressure of the boundary k calculated by the interpolation of the fluid particles in its support domain p k is the pressure of boundary particle k calculated according to the equation of state β 0 7 is adopted in the present simulations based on extensive calibration tests a detail discussion of the value of β can be found in ren et al 2014 2 3 2 the wavemaker boundary condition the wavemaker boundary is simulated as a moving plate the treatments of wavemaker particles are the same as those of fixed boundary particles except that their positions are updated according to a given wavemaker function the movement of the wavemaker generates the required incident wave and absorbs the reflected wave at the same time according to gao 2011 the horizontal velocity of the absorbing wavemaker can be expressed as 17 u t d x 0 d t ω φ 2 η 0 η where x 0 and ω are the amplitude and frequency of the wavemaker movement respectively η 0 is the target water surface elevation and η is the local water surface elevation φ is the transfer function and can be written as 18 φ 4 sinh 2 k d 2 k d sinh 2 k d where k is the wave number and d is the water depth it is worth mentioning that the generated waves are rather sensitive to the value of η 3 verification of the sph model this section is to verify the performance of the sph model by comparing the simulated results with the analytical results and the available experimental data all the simulations shown in this paper are completed at the supercomputing center of the chinese academy of sciences each blade node contains two ten core intel xeon e5 2680 v2 processors with a clock speed of 2 8 ghz and 64 0 gb ram in addition a uniform particle spacing dx 1 0 cm and a constant smoothing length h 1 5dx are used in the present section the performance of the diffusive term added to the continuity equation is tested using a simple hydrostatic problem a 2d tank partially filled with water at rest the tank width is 1 0 m and the water depth is 0 5 m the particle distributions of the sph model with the present diffusive term are shown in fig 1 the simulated results with the diffusive terms adopted by ferrari et al 2009 and antuono et al 2012 are also displayed in fig 1 as a comparison the dashed blue line in this figure represents the initial water level from fig 1 it can be seen that a smoothing pressure field is obtained using any of the three schemes of the diffusive term whereas for ferrari et al s 2009 model the fluid particles tend to move upwards and the hydrostatic solution is completely misinterpreted the unphysical rising process of the free surface is also displayed in fig 2 conversely antuono et al s 2012 model and the present model can conserve the total volume of the fluid system well the present sph model can obtain the same accuracy as antuono et al s 2012 model in addition another 2d tank is used to test the computational cost of the present model and antuono s model the tank is modelled using 81 509 particles with an initial particle space of 0 0045 m the simulation time is 1 0 s and the computational times on the single 3 4 ghz intel i7 6800k core with 16 gb ram are approximately 291 min and 363 min for the present model and antuono s model respectively the present model gives a reduction in the computational time of approximately 19 8 as it does not need to calculate the renormalized density gradient beforehand the performance of the present sph model is then examined for wave generation and wave propagation as shown in fig 3 a the initial water depth is 0 5 m and the computational domain is 15 m long with an active absorbing wavemaker at the left end and an artificial viscosity sponge layer at the right end of the flume fig 4 shows the particle distribution and the pressure field near the wave maker using the original and modified dbc respectively an unphysical separation between the fluid particles and the boundary particles can be observed obviously near the free surface using the original dbc this separation phenomenon will lead to an error of the instantaneous free surface near the wave maker which is important for the active absorbing wavemaker used in the present model fig 5 displays the comparisons of the time series of the dynamic pressure at the bottom boundary and the results show that the pressure by the modified dbc is more in agreement with the second order stokes wave theory fig 6 gives the comparisons of the fluid particle distribution and the pressure field between the present and original sph model the artificial viscosity proposed by monaghan 1994 is considered in the original sph model to describe the diffusive term and the relevant parameters are set to α 0 03 and β 0 0 as seen in fig 6 the pressure oscillations generally occur in the original sph model computational domain in addition because the particles near the free surface have a truncated support domain a separation between the free surface particles and the adjacent particles at the wave crest can be observed in the original sph model fig 7 gives the comparisons of the temporal variation of the free surface pressure calculated from the original and present sph models the averaged value of the free surface pressure calculated from the present model is 26 pa whereas the value from the original model is 134 pa therefore the present model can better satisfy the free surface conditions than the original model the comparisons of the sph results and the analytical results in terms of the free surface elevations at different locations are shown in fig 8 as seen in this figure the results of the present sph model are in good agreement with the analytical results of the second order stokes wave whereas the wave height of the original sph model seriously decreases due to excessive wave energy dissipation during wave propagation the sph model is further verified by simulating the wave force and torque acting on a fully reflective vertical wall the analytical solution proposed by sainflou 1928 is used as a reference to assess the standing wave loads sainflou 1928 formula is theoretically derived for a fully reflective vertical wall based on the assumption of the linear pressure distribution and it can accurately predict the wave force when the relative depth d l is in the range of 0 1 0 15 the numerical model for a standing wave acting on a fully reflective vertical wall is shown in fig 3 b the wave flume is 8 66 m long with an active absorbing wavemaker at the left end and a vertical wall at the right end of the flume the wave period is 1 95 s and the initial water depth is 0 6 m the six different wave heights shown in table 1 are simulated the subscripts c and t refer to the instants of the wave crest and wave trough respectively the hydrodynamic force and the corresponding torque acting on the vertical wall under different wave conditions are calculated and compared with sainflou s 1928 solution as shown in table 1 the predicted wave force and the corresponding torque by the sph model agree well with the analytical solution and the maximum error is less than 6 as stated above the pressure is calculated explicitly by solving the equation of state rather than the poisson equation in the weakly compressible sph model therefore a small density oscillation will generate a large pressure variation the spurious pressure oscillations are responsible for the errors between the sph model and the analytical solution although the pressure oscillations are lightened by adding a diffusive term into the continuity equation in the present model this error is acceptable for the weakly compressible sph model considering the predicted sph results relating to wave interaction with coastal structures by other researchers didier et al 2014 fig 9 and fig 10 give the comparisons of the hydrodynamic force and the corresponding torque between the numerical and analytical results for different wave conditions described in table 1 the correlations between the sph results and sainflou s predictions are all larger than 0 95 fig 11 gives the time series of the free surface elevations at the nodes and the antinodes for standing waves it can be observed that the amplitude of the standing wave is about twice the target value at the antinodes and is approximately 0 at the nodes which indicates the active wavemaker can absorb the re reflected waves at the wavemaker boundary the performance of the sph model is further examined by simulating wave interaction with an offshore oscillating water chamber and the simulated results are compared with iturrioz et al s 2015 experimental results as shown in fig 3 c the numerical wave flume is 15 0 m and the initial water depth is 0 6 m an active absorbing wavemaker is placed at the left end of the flume and an artificial viscosity sponge layer is set at the right end of the tank to absorb the transmitted wave a fixed and offshore oscillating water chamber is placed 5 4 m from the wavemaker the distance between the water chamber front and back walls is 0 3 m and the submerged depth is 0 2 m as shown in fig 3 c following the setup of iturrioz et al s 2015 physical experiment nine wave gauges were placed along the flume for analysing the free surface elevation outside and inside the water chamber as seen in fig 3 c four wave gauges were placed in the seaside of the structure one wave gauge was placed in the middle of the water chamber and four additional wave gauges were installed in the leeside of the structure the corresponding coordinates of wave gauges are listed in table 2 in this work the simulation is conducted with incoming regular waves of t 1 3 s 1 7 s and h 0 08 m and with a top opening of 0 05 m following iturrioz et al s 2015 statement the air pressure in the chamber is negligible when the top opening is 0 05 m and then the present single phase sph model without a power take off system can be implemented to predict the fluid motion around the water chamber the computational domain is modelled using approximately 124 000 particles the simulated time is set to 20 s and the computational time with 12 cpus is approximately 6 h fig 12 and fig 13 give the comparisons of the free surface elevations outside and inside the chamber between the sph results and the corresponding experimental data of iturrioz et al 2015 respectively as shown in these figures a good agreement between the numerical and experimental results is obtained both in terms of the wave amplitude and the non linear process of wave evolution around the chamber a partial standing wave pattern is developed on the seaside of the chamber caused by the wave reflection and the amplitude of the transmitted wave is slightly smaller than the incident wave from the comparisons between the sph results and the analytical results as well as the available experimental data it can be found that the present sph model performs well for simulating wave transformation and the wave force acting on coastal structures 4 numerical simulation of an onshore oscillating water chamber in this section the verified sph model is used to study the hydrodynamics of a simple oscillating water chamber under wave action it is worthwhile to emphasize that the hydrodynamics of the oscillating water chamber are characterized by the complicated dynamic process of vortex formation and dying out numerical simulation of such a process relies on an advanced turbulence model which is known to be difficult with classical sph models the computational setup is shown in fig 14 an active absorbing wavemaker is placed at the left end of the flume and an oscillating water chamber is positioned at the right end of the flume the main objective of this study is to study the hydrodynamics of the oscillating water chamber and the effect of the air motion is ignored in the chamber the initial water depth d is 0 5 m the relative wave height h d varies from 0 12 to 0 24 and the relative front wall depth h c d varies from 0 2 to 0 7 three different water chambers of 0 12 m 0 32 m and 0 52 m long are simulated respectively the wave period is in the range of 0 9 3 0 s an initial particle spacing of dx 1 0 cm is used for all the cases and the computational domain is modelled using nearly 51 000 particles the simulated time is set to 20 s and the computational time with 10 cpus is approximately 4 h 4 1 effect of incident wave height fig 15 and fig 16 show the comparisons of the free surface elevations outside and inside the chamber for different wave heights figure a represents the time series of the outside gauges that are 0 15 m away from the front wall of the water chamber and figure b represents the time series of the inside gauges in the middle of the chamber the vof results calculated by commercial fluent software are used to compare with the sph results as a reference the fluent simulations are carried out with the segregated solver and the standard k ω turbulence model the simplec algorithm is used for coupling pressure and velocity a vof algorithm is applied for capturing the free surface a non slip condition is imposed on the fixed boundaries and wave generation is simulated by imposing the velocity components and volume fraction on the wavemaker boundary grid spaces of dx 0 04 m and dz 0 025 m are used and the time step is set as t 600 from figs 15 and 16 it can be seen that the free surface elevations calculated by the sph model and by the fluent code are in good agreement in general although there are some differences especially for the free surface elevation inside the chamber it can also be seen that the time series of the free surface elevations by the sph model have better stability and reproducibility a detailed description of the complex velocity field and the distribution of the normalized turbulence eddy viscosity υ t υ υ 10 6 m 2 s near the chamber is given in fig 17 at four instants during one wave period the four instants correspond to the wave crest the zero down crossing the wave trough and the zero up crossing inside the water chamber the velocity field has been plotted by mapping the individual particle velocities onto a fixed grid of 2 cm 2 cm using the interpolations of the sph kernel the information of turbulence eddy viscosity is used to infer the behaviour of turbulence intensity as the sub particle scale sps which is analogous to the definition of the sub grid scale in mesh based models turbulent kinetic energy can be approximately related to the turbulence eddy viscosity by a turbulent constant in fig 17 a at t t 0 0 the free surface elevation inside the water chamber reaches the maximum value an anticlockwise vortex is observed at the entry of the chamber which is formed due to the high velocity near the front wall the turbulence energy is concentrated on the bottom end of the front wall in the chamber in fig 17 b at t t 0 25 the free surface inside the water chamber is down crossing the initial water level the water particles in the chamber move downwards with large velocity and then return to the open sea through the water chamber entry where the turbulence is obviously stronger in fig 17 c at t t 0 5 the free surface elevation inside the water chamber reaches the minimum value the velocity intensity is weak inside the water chamber and a clockwise rotation vortex is noticed at the bottom end of the front wall outside the chamber the turbulence energy is mainly distributed around the water chamber entry in fig 17 d at t t 0 75 the free surface inside the water chamber is up crossing the initial water level an intense water flux from the outside to the inside of the chamber can be observed at the water chamber entry and the water particles in the chamber move upwards with high velocity a stronger turbulence zone is formed at the water chamber entry as seen in fig 17 significant variation of velocity can be observed along the vertical wall to the chamber entry due to the periodic water flux exchange between the fluid particles inside and outside the water chamber in addition the stronger turbulence energy is distributed around the entry of the chamber where the vortices are periodically generated convected and destroyed wave energy loss induced by vortex shedding at the water chamber entry can be estimated by the total energy dissipation as there is not a power take off system installed in the present model fig 18 gives the reflection coefficients and the total wave energy dissipation coefficients for different wave periods the total energy dissipation is evaluated from the measured reflection coefficient and can be calculated by 19 c d 1 c r 2 where c d and c r are the energy dissipation coefficient and the reflection coefficient as seen in fig 18 the energy dissipation coefficient first increases and then decreases with increasing wave period and the trend of the reflection coefficient is opposite as expected the maximal value of c d is approximately 0 9 at t 1 5 s indicating that the maximal energy extraction efficiency is not more than 0 9 for the present structure form fig 19 displays the relative wave heights inside the chamber for different incident wave heights the relative wave height is defined as the ratio of the average wave height inside the chamber h av to the incident wave height h h av is defined as the change of the volume inside the chamber divided by the water chamber length to eliminate the influence of the free surface sloshing as seen in fig 19 the maximum value of the relative wave height h av h is approximately 1 0 for the wave period of 1 2 s whereas it is up to 1 9 for the wave period of 1 5 s which is close to the natural period of the water chamber for both of the wave periods the relative wave height decreases with the increase of the incident wave height because the interactions between the incident wave and the chamber are more complex and wave energy dissipation is more intensive for the higher wave height since the operation environment of the owc device is usually very severe it is important to investigate the forces acting on the front vertical wall of the water chamber for design purpose the time series of the total forces acting on the front wall is shown in fig 20 the forces are defined positive in the wave propagation direction as seen in fig 20 the forces increase as wave height increases and their maximum values are approximately 260 n and 300 n for wave periods of 1 2 s and 1 5 s respectively the wave force acting on the front vertical wall is caused by the difference of wave run ups between the two sides of the front wall fig 21 gives the time series of wave run ups on the outside and inside of the front wall as shown in this figure although the run ups on the outside and inside of the front wall for the case of t 1 2 s are much different from that of t 1 5 s their differences between the outside and inside of the wall for this two cases do not differ so much this is caused by the fact that the time series of wave run ups on the outside and inside of the front wall have different phase differences for different wave periods 4 2 effect of wave period fig 22 shows the relative wave height inside the water chamber for different wave periods as observed in fig 22 the relative wave height inside the chamber is almost half of the incident wave height for t 1 0 s and increases with the wave period until t 1 8 s the average wave height almost stabilizes at h av being about twice the incident wave height the time series of the total forces acting on the front vertical wall for different wave periods are displayed in fig 23 as seen in this figure the time series of the forces are no longer the standard cosine curves for the larger wave periods because the interactions between the incident wave and the water chamber are more complex with the increase of wave period it can also be seen that the peak value of the force is slightly larger than the magnitude of the trough value for the wave period of 1 2 s whereas the peak value is obviously smaller that the magnitude of the trough value for the wave period of 2 4 s due to the differences of the free surface elevations on the outside and inside of the front wall for different wave periods as shown in fig 22 4 3 effect of submerged depth fig 24 gives the fluid particle distribution inside and outside the water chamber for different submerged depths of the front wall at four instants during one wave period the front wall depth is 0 35 m for the left column 0 25 m for the middle column and 0 15 m for the right column as shown in fig 24 the complexity of wave interaction with the water chamber increases with the decrease of the front wall depth for the front wall depths of 0 35 m and 0 25 m the free surface elevations inside the chamber can be viewed as a horizontal plane whereas for the front wall depth of 0 15 m the incident wave interacts strongly with the front wall and a sloshing phenomenon can be observed inside the water chamber the sloshing phenomena inside the chamber have been observed by a series of the physical experiments and other numerical models davyt et al 2010 he and huang 2016 the transmitted waves through the front wall first reflect at the back wall of the chamber and part of the reflected waves are reflected back by the front wall resulting in multiple reflections inside the chamber the complicated interactions among the incident and multiple reflected waves may produce a sloshing phenomenon in the chamber liu et al 2010 for a detailed discussion of the sloshing phenomenon inside the water chamber fig 25 displays the time series of the sloshing parameter for different front wall depths the sloshing parameter is defined as s z f z r h where z f and z r are the free surface elevations at the front wall and the rear wall of the chamber respectively from fig 25 it can be seen that the sloshing phenomenon is nearly negligible when hc 0 35 m and there is a slight disturbance when hc 0 25 m the sloshing phenomena becomes obvious when hc 0 1 m and 0 15 m the frequency of the sloshing parameter is about twice the incident wave frequency in agreement with the conclusion of davyt et al 2010 in these cases the length of the water chamber is 0 32 m and the natural lowest frequency of the fluid inside the water chamber is nearly twice the incident wave frequency that is in the simulation the incoming wave is the 2 nd stokes wave and the component of the double frequency induces the horizontal sloshing of the fluid in the chamber when hc 0 1 m and 0 15 m whereas the antisymmetric sloshing mode is suppressed when hc 0 25 m and 0 35 m in these situations the ratio between the chamber length and the immersion depth is small and the inside water column can be considered as a rigid piston rezanejad et al 2013 therefore the internal free surfaces in these cases are nearly undisturbed and the piston like water columns oscillate only in the vertical direction 4 4 effect of chamber length fig 26 gives the relative wave height inside different chamber lengths from fig 26 it can be observed that the relative wave height increases with the decrease of the water chamber length the relative wave height inside the chamber is smaller than half of the incident wave height for all the three different chamber lengths when t 0 9 s and they increase with the wave period until t 1 4 s t 1 8 s and t 2 4 s for the water chamber lengths of 12 cm 32 cm and 52 cm respectively it can also be seen that the stabilized values of h av are approximately 2 5 2 0 and 1 5 times the incident wave height for water chamber lengths of 12 cm 32 cm and 52 cm respectively 5 conclusions an improved sph turbulent model is developed to study the hydrodynamics of an oscillating water chamber for a hydrostatic problem the predicted results indicate that the presented pressure smoothing scheme can well conserve the total volume of the fluid system and smooth out the spurious pressure oscillation at relatively low computational costs the predicted wave force and torque for the standing wave acting on a fully reflective vertical wall agree with the analytical solutions and the free surface elevations outside and inside the offshore oscillating water chamber compare well with the corresponding experimental results for wave interaction with the onshore oscillating water chamber the numerical results show that the present sph model can reproduce the free surface elevations both outside and inside the water chamber the processes of vortex generation convection and dying out are also well captured the peak value of the wave force acting on the front wall is slightly greater than the valley values for smaller wave period whereas the peak value is obviously smaller than the valley value for larger wave period due to the differences of the free surface elevations on the outside and inside of the front wall in addition the complexity of wave interaction with the water chamber increases with the decrease of the front wall depth the surface elevation inside the chamber can be seen as a plane for a bigger value of the front wall depth whereas a sloshing phenomenon can be observed inside the water chamber for a smaller value of the front wall depth all the results obtained show that the present sph model can well reproduce the hydrodynamics of the oscillating water chamber future development may have to include the effect of the air motion in the water chamber by further extending the capacity of the sph model acknowledgements this work was supported by ng teng fong charitable foundation through tsinghua university education foundation tuef the

23631,this paper shows the behaviour of different eddy scales that are modulated by the various frequencies of the superimposed wave acting against the current flow it is observed that the mean velocity near the surface increases due to surface wave acting against current compared to the mean velocity of the only current flow moreover flow under the influence of the higher frequency waves results in larger scale velocity fluctuations when compared to the lower frequency waves the effect of the superimposed wave is more pronounced for velocity fluctuations in the vertical direction compare to that of the stream wise direction the peak value of the probability density function pdf of vertical velocity fluctuation decreases logarithmically with the increase in the elevation of the bed interestingly the frequency of the superimposed waves is the major parameter in modulating the eddy scales further it is observed that the frequency of the large scale energy containing eddies obtained from the wavelet transform is similar to that of the frequency of the superimposed wave itself even after removal of wave potential component in the random velocity signal keywords eddies pdf reynolds stress joint pdf wavelet analysis against wave 1 introduction the knowledge of the interaction between wave and current is crucial for marine environments the wave current combined flow near the surface affects loading on offshore structures mei et al 1989 near the bed the wave current interaction is responsible for transporting sediment wherein the waves pick up the sediments and the current carries it whitehouse 1998 also the information about the attenuation of waves is helpful for protecting the shores the currents can be ocean currents as well as tidal currents the work on wave current interaction has been going on for decades although several investigations have been carried out in the study of waves and currents separately little was known about the way in which the combined flows interact especially close to the bed initial work on wave current combined flow was done by einstein 1948 he suggested that the sand transportation by waves could be similar to that for uniform flow some of the multifaceted problems of bottom surface friction and energy dissipation in a superimposed wave on current has been studied by jonsson 1966 further bijker 1966 studied the variation of the bed shear of a current due to wave motion later work on wave following current was done by van hoften and karaki 1977 wherein experiments on validation of the theoretical models for wave amplitude attenuation and mean velocity changes for waves of single frequency propagating with a current were carried out kemp and simons 1983 performed experiments to investigate the mean velocity profile for waves against a current they reported that the measured velocity departs from the logarithmic law close to the bed gradually increases and finally becomes more than that of the only current case in addition turbulent intensities increase due to the superposition of waves against a current similar results were obtained by van der kaaij and nieuwjaar 1987 and van kampen and nap 1988 under irregular waves current combined environment van rijn et al 1993 concluded that the waves cause a decrease in velocity near the free surface for waves following current and an increase in an opposing current nielsen and you 1997 put forward a theoretical model for the profile of the eulerian mean velocity induced by wave current interactions using a 2 d stress balance concept further dingemans et al 1997 tried to explain the changes in mean velocity profile for wave current combined flow using secondary local circulations by craik leibovich vortex forces this was later supported by experiments performed by klopman 1997 groeneweg and klopman 1998 and groeneweg and battjes 1999 used the generalized lagrangian mean glm formulation to investigate the change of the eulerian mean velocity due to the superimposition of the wave out of all the experimental investigations mentioned above only kemp and simons 1983 and klopman 1994 both conducted experiments for the whole water depth and primarily focussed on the mean velocity changes when the waves acted against the current in their experiments kemp and simons 1983 used 1 hz frequency waves and klopman 1994 used 0 7 hz frequency waves it may be pointed out here that the influence of wave acting against the current on the turbulence characteristics of the background current was not investigated in these studies moreover both these studies were carried out with a wave of a single frequency and thus the effect of the varying wave frequencies on the flow characteristics remained unexplored later umeyama 2005 performed a series of experiments where wave height and wave period were varied in different tests experiments were carried out for the only current case waves following current and waves against the current the mean velocity in the channel was about 12 cm s both along current and against current cases vertical profiles of mean velocity and reynolds shear stress were measured at a distance of 10 5 m from the wave generator a significant reduction of the mean velocity was observed up to mid water depth from the water surface for waves acting against the current further the reynolds stress decreased throughout the water depth for the combined wave current environment for both the cases waves acting along and against the current when compared to the only current case several theoretical models have been proposed for the estimation of bed shear stress and the angle between the wave and current e g sleath 1991 many more studies were concerned with the non linear interactions and their effect on velocity structures e g hedges et al 1985 dingemans et al 1997 smith 2006 zhang et al 2014 despite all the investigations mentioned above only a few studies went into the studying of the mechanics of the interaction between the waves and the current acting against each other according to hussain 1986 a coherent structure is a connected turbulent fluid mass with instantaneously phase correlated vorticity over its spatial extent this definition depicts that the coherent structures are characterised as coherent vorticity that may have distinct boundaries and independent regions later adrian and marusic 2012 stated that coherent motions are frequent and are known as turbulent eddies these motions characterize the flow and play significant role in defining the mean flow stress and other statistical properties it may be mentioned here that singh et al 2016 studied in detail the turbulent coherent structures for waves acting along current environment however these studies have not focussed deeply into the understanding of the hidden mechanisms of the modulation of turbulent structures due to the superimposed surface waves on the current thus understanding the underlying mechanisms and characteristics of the turbulent eddies in both space and time domain within the wave current combined environment is an interesting area for exploration farge 1992 reported that a wavelet transform is an efficient tool for the characterization of a random signal in both space and time domain camussi and gui 1997 carried out the orthonormal wavelet decomposition for grid generated turbulent and turbulent jet flow and showed the distribution of coherent structures further longo 2003 quantified the turbulent kinetic energy and the coherent structures using orthogonal wavelets for spilling waves later on longo 2009 reported the pre breaking monochromatic waves using orthogonal wavelets recently roy et al 2017 studied the distribution of turbulent eddy scales for waves acting along the current using wavelet transform modulation of turbulent structures due to the presence of any external influence is an important area of research and thus many studies have focused on this subject literature reveals that the studies mainly focussed on the effect of large scale turbulent structures on a small scale which could be manifested through modulation of either amplitude or frequency rao et al 1971 stated that the dynamics of the energy balance within a turbulent boundary layer might be characterized through a coupling between the inner and outer layer turbulent structures sandborn 1959 batchelor and townsend 1949 observed that the bursting of turbulence structures are associated with the well known phenomenon of intermittency in the small scale structures of turbulence this turbulent bursting comprises the low speed and high speed events further hutchins and marusic 2007 studied the wall turbulence and noted that a large reynolds number flow consists of several large fluctuations or superstructure events high speed events they also observed that the superstructures are not simply superimposed as a low wavenumber in the near wall region somewhat they seem to dynamically modulate the production of the turbulent scales within the near wall region ganapathisubramani et al 2012 studied the wall turbulence and showed that the small scale amplitude computed as the mean square of the small scale signal increases with increasing large scale fluctuations from negative to positive in the near wall regions on the contrary the small scale amplitude decreases with increasing large scale fluctuation away from the wall this clearly reveals that the increasing strength of the large scale fluctuations is capable of modulating the amplitude of a turbulent signal however as per authors knowledge there is a few work reported on the characteristics of the modulated random velocity fluctuation due to waves acting against the current thus the intention of the present investigation is to get an insight into the distribution of turbulent eddies for wave against current flow in this paper normalized phase averaged turbulent mean velocity intensity reynolds shear stress and pdf of streamwise and vertical velocity components are presented for waves acting against current environment furthermore the joint probability density function pdf of streamwise and vertical velocity fluctuations is presented also the wavelet transform of the random velocity fluctuations is computed to get an improved idea towards the distribution of turbulent eddies due to superimposed surface waves acting against the current overall this paper is focussed on presenting a picture of how the wave frequency modulates the time and length scales of the turbulent eddies within the flow field for waves acting against the current 2 experiments and data analysis 2 1 experimental set up the experiments were carried out at fluid mechanics and hydraulics laboratory fmhl department of aerospace engineering and applied mechanics iiest shibpur in a flume of length 18 m and cross section of 0 9 m by 0 9 m with a slope of 0 00025 fig 1 a vertical reciprocating plunger type wavemaker was installed near the outlet of the flume for more details about the mechanism of the wave maker please see barman et al 2016 and roy et al 2017 2 2 measurement technique a sontek 16 mhz micro acoustic doppler velocimeter micro adv was used to measure the instantaneous velocity of the fluid flow the measurement location has been chosen at a distance of 11 m from the inlet of the flume a discharge control valve maintained the water supply into the flume the data were measured for 3 min at each measuring point the size of the sampling volume of the 16 mhz micro adv is 0 09 cm3 the accuracy of the adv is 1 0 of the observed velocity the discharge control valve and the tailgate were adjusted to allow for maintaining the desired flow depth h at a particular discharge the depth was continuously monitored manually all through the experiment against marked scales fastened to the perspex wall at the test section also an abs digimatic depth gauge manufactured by mitutoyo model no vds 60dc code no 571 205 10 was attached to a traversing trolley for more accurate measurements a flow meter at the pump delivery section was used for continuous monitoring of the discharge also an electronic relay is connected to the power input of the pump for maintaining constant power supply before the present experimental campaign was carried out velocity measurements with acoustic doppler velocimeter undertaken at a different time at the test section for a particular discharge recorded by flowmeter gave almost constant mean velocity and r m s velocity deviation less than 1 an ideal seeding material for peak sensitivity of the adv measurements to maintain the desired signal to noise ratio should have the mean seeding particle diameter of 10 20 μm sontek ysi inc 2007 in the present experiment we have used kaolinite clay as tracer particles of mean particle size 15 μm please note that the water in the sump was stirred every 30 min to keep the seeding particles in suspension and thus to achieve the desired signal to noise ratio 20 for all measurements three different cases wca1 wca2 and wca3 with a superimposed wave of frequencies f 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 hz were used against the current for the present study and the results were compared with ca current alone i e without superimposed surface waves the choice of the frequency range i e f 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 hz of the superimposed waves was made considering two major factors firstly for waves acting against the current with frequency f 1 5 hz the wave train was observed to become distorted and was unable to sustain for the entire length of the flume against the current on the contrary for smaller frequencies f 0 7 hz the waves were not prominently seen probably this is the reason why the previous investigations on wave acting against current were also reported in the frequency ranging from 0 7 f 1 2 measurement of the velocity components was performed at fifteen points in the vertical direction at the test location as shown in fig 2 for a flow with wave against the current the points were chosen more densely near the bed so as to obtain a clear picture of the near bed turbulence structure waves were generated against the mean flow reynolds number re u h ν 3 55 104 where u represents the depth average mean streamwise velocity h is the water depth and ν is the kinematic viscosity the wavemaker was present at 7 m further downstream of the test section the water depth was maintained at 16 5 cm for all the four different test cases the frequency of the wave maker was controlled by changing the voltage of the input supply to the motor of the wave maker using an electronic variac the instantaneous velocity data was acquired by the adv with a sampling frequency of 40 hz and were stored directly on the computer and were later processed for more details on hydrodynamic parameters please see tables 1 and 2 2 3 theoretical methodology the instantaneous velocity components for waves following current can be obtain as 1 u t u u t u v t v v t v w t w w t w where u t u t u v t v t v w t w t w the overhead bar denotes the time averaged velocity overhead tilde denotes wave induced velocity and a prime denotes the velocity fluctuations the wave induced velocity u t is obtained by subtracting the time averaged velocity u from the ensemble average velocity u t for the wave current combined flow the corresponding normalized streamwise and transverse phase average velocity can be written as 2 u ˆ u t u w ˆ w t u for wave against a current the normalized phase averaged stream wise turbulence intensities are given by the equation 3 u 1 n t 0 n u t u t 2 u where n total number of observation periods further the normalized phase averaged reynolds shear stress in xz plane is defined by 4 τ u w ρ u w ρ n t 0 n u t u t w t w t the estimation of the phase averaged turbulence parameters are similar to umeyama 2005 and barman et al 2016 to test whether the signals were repeatable and ergodic for wave current combined flow the wave reflections in the laboratory flume are analyzed herein the normalized errors δ u n of the squared magnitude of the mean velocity obtained with n 120 realizations for a given phase were calculated at a point z h 0 2 as similar to melville et al 2002 mattioli et al 2012 2013 5 δ u n u n u 120 2 u 120 2 where u n represent the n number of phase average velocity and u 120 is the 120th number of phase average velocity fig 3 shows the distributions of the normalized error δ u n of mean velocity as a function of realization n at z h 0 2 for f 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 hz mattioli et al 2013 reported that the normalized error was approximately 3 after 80 realizations for the all tested waves it is observed from fig 3 that for n 60 the velocity record shows negligible scattering effect δ u n 3 3 5 and 4 for f 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 hz respectively a similar test was carried out for different locations in the test section that gave similar results not shown here thus the present results are in good agreement with the results of mattioli et al 2013 an estimation of the uncertainty for statistical turbulence parameters is necessary for having information on the data quality pertaining to statistical errors arising due to the physical constraint of the measurement technique used by the instrument as well as uncertainties associated with the boundary conditions the estimates of the variance errors of the sample mean and variance for uncorrelated samples applicable for any statistical parameter distribution can be defined as garcía et al 2005 6 ζ mean ζ u n mef 7 ζ var 2 n vef ζ u where ζ u represents the sample variance of the variable u 8 n mef t t 2 t s 9 n vef t t t s where t t is the total sampling time and ts is the integral time scale using autocorrelation method moving block bootstrap mbb technique garcía et al 2006 is a conventional tool for quantification of the uncertainty with 95 confidence intervals for each turbulence parameter and is used herein for uncertainty analysis an essential parameter in the mbb technique is the optimum length of the block politis and white 2004 and garcía et al 2005 reported that the optimum block length could be estimated based on the observed autocorrelation function of each recorded signal in this present study the optimum block length is estimated using the method proposed by politis and white 2004 and garcía et al 2006 the synthetic data set was computed using mbb method for a wide range of flow conditions 3 55 10 4 re 12 37 10 4 velocity signal in each coordinate direction was synthesized with 1000 replications each of 3 min time duration with data intervals at 40 hz frequency here as a sample case we show the data computed at a distance 11 m from the flume inlet in a particular point z h 0 4 fig 4 a and b show the error variance of the sample mean and variance respectively these parameters were computed for each signal based on mbb technique and the values are plotted as a function of the values obtained from experimental data using eqs 6 and 7 it is noted that the average relative error of the standard error of the sample mean is approximately 3 6 for the sample variance the average relative error is obtained as 14 5 fig 4 a and b reveals that a good agreement between the signal synthesised by mbb technique and that from eqs 6 and 7 is evident fig 4 c and d shows the comparison plots between probability distribution of the ts and u mean computed from the experimental data and using mbb technique the error values for both the parameters as shown in fig 4 c and d are 13 3 results and discussion 3 1 mean velocity profile the vertical distribution of the normalised mean stream wise velocity u u u is shown in fig 5 the profile of u for the only current flow follows the logarithmic law as shown by the dashed line in fig 5 it is observed in fig 5 that due to the superimposed surface waves against the current u starts to deviate from the log law as observed from fig 5 a b and c the deviation in u starts to increase toward the free surface these results for different frequencies are in a good argument with the results produced by umeyama 2005 and kemp and simons 1983 which suggested that there will be an increase in u near the surface in a flow with wave against the current the reason for the increase in the mean velocity is the wave induced mass transport phenomena as mentioned in kemp and simons 1983 it can also be inferred that the energy loss due to the wave attenuation is larger for a wave opposing current compared to the wave following current case kemp and simons 1983 this energy loss can be related to the increase in mean velocity the u profile with respect to the variation in the wave frequency is shown in fig 5 a c it can also be observed in fig 5 a c that the vertical position z h at which the stream wise mean velocity deviates positive from the log law dashed line moves closer to the bed as the frequency of the superimposed waves becomes smaller this shows that the penetration of the wave induced mass transport phenomena due to a lower frequency wave e g fig 5 a is deeper into the current in the vertical direction compared to the higher frequency wave e g fig 5 c this result is also in good agreement with umeyama 2005 recently yuan and madsen 2015 proposed a model for eddy viscosity and velocity distribution as a function of vertical distance for currents in present of superimposed surface waves fig 5 d shows a comparative study of the vertical distributions of streamwise velocity having different superimposed wave frequency with the existing model proposed by yuan and madsen 2015 it is evident from fig 5 d that the vertical velocity distributions of the present experimental data follow the similar trend as that of the existing model yuan and madsen 2015 however there is a little deviation of velocity values observed at the upper region z h 0 4 to 0 8 and close to the bed z h 0 01 to 0 04 these deviations may be due to the differences in the background experimental conditions such as flume bed material generation of waves and direction of flow e g yuan and madsen 2015 used marble bed 3 2 turbulent intensities fig 6 a d shows the vertical and stream wise phase averaged turbulent intensity w and u as a function of z h for four different cases the u is much higher than w for all the cases throughout the water depth the frequency of the superimposed waves is similar to that of umeyama 2005 for cases wca1 and wca2 there is negligible variation in u and w due to change in frequency of the waves throughout the water depth fig 6 d shows the variation of u and w with z h for frequency 1 2 hz the vertical distribution of u and w wca3 fig 6 d maintain a similar trend as that of wca1 and wca2 fig 6 b and c it can be stated from fig 6 a d that the vertical distribution of the turbulence intensity profiles shows a small increase due to the superimposed surface waves against the current cases wca1 wca2 and wca3 as compared to the current alone case ca throughout the water depth 3 3 reynolds stresses the vertical distribution of the phase averaged normalised reynolds stress u w τ u w u 2 is shown in fig 7 a d for four different cases ca wca1 wca2 and wca3 and are compared with the normalised stress profiles of umeyama 2005 it is evident from fig 7 a d that the reynolds stress remains positive throughout the water depth and it attains a maximum value at a small distance above the bed for all the cases further u w decreases due to the superimposition of the surface wave against the current wca1 wca2 and wca3 as compared to the current alone case ca it can also be seen that with the increase of the frequency of the wave there is a small decrease in u w near the bed fig 7 d shows a similar trend of u w for wca3 f 1 2 hz as that of wca1 f 1 0 hz and wca2 f 1 1 hz the present experimental results are in good agreement with umeyama 2005 3 4 distribution of probability density function of the velocity fluctuations the pdf of stream wise and vertical velocity fluctuations are computed based on the method described in tennekes and lumley 1972 fig 8 shows the variation of the probability density function pdf of the stream wise velocity fluctuations u and the vertical velocity fluctuations w for four different cases ca wca1 wca2 and wca3 at three different elevations from the bed z h 0 01 0 12 0 51 please note that for clarity of presentation all data in each of the pdf plots were interpolated using cubic splines de boor et al 1978 generally for the stream wise velocity measured for a particular point the statistical moment of nth order can be computed as e g czernuszenko and rowiński 2008 roy and debnath 2017 10 φ u t n u t n p u t u t d u where φ represents the expected value p u is the pdf and n 1 2 3 for a stationary ergodic process φ u n is easy to the manifestation 11 φ u t n u t n lim t 1 t t 0 t 0 t u n d t where the indicates a phase averaged value t t 0 is the initial time of a particular phase and t duration of the phase it is assumed that all the data series are stationary and ergodic therefore to estimate the pdf eq 11 is used herein the characteristics of the distribution of velocity fluctuations can be evaluated from the mean root mean square rms the skewness s u and kurtosis k u and are defined as rinne 2010 12 u r m s σ u t u t 2 s u u t u t 3 σ 3 k u u t u t 4 σ 4 here su and ku represent the skewness and kurtosis of the p u similarly sw and kw represent the skewness and kurtosis of the p w in general it can be observed from fig 8 a l that the smaller fluctuations of w are more prominent than that of u for all the cases it may be due to the constant influx of the large fluctuations u in the flow direction due to the mean flow fig 8 a e and i represent the only current case ca and it is evident that the peak values of both p u and p w are almost similar for all the vertical positions z h 0 01 0 12 and 0 51 fig 8 a e and i whereas for wca1 f 1 0 hz fig 8 b f and j it can be clearly observed that the peak value of the pdf of both u and w decreases as the distance from the bed increases and the surface wave has a significant influence on the distribution of velocity fluctuations it can be observed that smaller values of both u and w are redistributed and the turbulent velocity fluctuations dominate the flow it is important to note here that the peak value of the pdf of w p max w decrease more significantly compared to that of p max u a similar observation is also evident for wca2 fig 6 c g and k and wca3 fig 6 d h and l fig 9 shows the variation of p max w as a function of z h for ca wca1 wca2 and wca3 it is interesting to notice that the distribution of p max w as a function of z h follows the logarithmic function given by 13 p max w a λ ln z h here the values of the coefficients a and λ are shown in table 3 it can be seen that λ is negative for wca1 wca2 and wca3 this suggests a logarithmic decay of p max w as z h increases for the cases with superimposed waves there is no such trend of the p max w values for the current alone case ca it can also be observed in table 3 that the decay rate λ decreases by a small amount as the frequency of the superimposed waves increases the rate at which the p max w decreases with the increase in the distance from the bed slows down when the frequency of the superimposed wave increases the decrease in pdf of the small scales of u is significant in the presence of waves fig 8 b d compared to that of the current alone case fig 8 a there is a small change in the p u with the change in frequency of the wave fig 8 b d the decrease in the peak values of the pdf of both u and w due to the presence of waves is more pronounced near the free surface fig 8 j l as compared to the near bed region fig 8 b d it can also be inferred that the scale of the eddies increases near the surface due to the superimposed surface waves and the effect is transported towards the bed in a progressive manner the decrease in the peak value of pdf and its distribution within the area under the curve means wave energy is acting against current modulates the smaller scale fluctuations to a larger fluctuation band through cascading process ganapathisubramani et al 2012 studied the wall turbulence problem and noted that small scale amplitude increases with increasing value of the large scale fluctuations in the near wall region results of the present study and the study of ganapathisubramani et al 2012 clearly depicts that the external influences e g wall roughness bluff body superimposed surface waves etc on the incident turbulent flow are capable of modulating small scale amplitudes moreover the peak value of the pdf of w especially in cases of fig 8 f h appears to decrease with increasing frequency rapidly in comparison to the peak value of the pdf of u this shows that the small fluctuations are more modulated by the waves acting against the current 3 5 joint probability density function the joint probability distribution provides information on the probability of the occurrence of stream wise and transverse velocity fluctuations within any particular range or discrete set of values specified for these variables jointly following the methodology of sukhodolov et al 1988 the joint probability density function b u w is estimated herein the characteristic function ξ α β for the estimation of the joint probability density function b u w of the streamwise and vertical velocity fluctuations are defined as 14 ξ α β exp i u α w β b u w d u d w where α and β are its arguments using an inverse transform of equation 14 in which the terms of ξ α β less than fourth order are taken into account b u w can be written as sukhodolov et al 1988 15 b u w 1 2 π exp i u α v β ξ α β d α d β 16 b u w ψ u w 1 a b 3 4 q a b a b k a b u w where q ab is the cumulant abe 1993 here ψ u w is the gaussian distribution for two variables and k a b is a kernel polynomial of the order a b and is defined as 17 ψ u w 1 2 π 1 τ 2 exp u 2 2 τ u w w 2 2 1 τ 2 where τ u w u 2 is the correlation coefficient equation 16 represents a joint probability density distribution of the gram charlier type for the bivariate case the intermittent joint velocity structures of any turbulent flow can be computed from the time series data of two different velocity components collected from a particular point in the flow field that can be used for categorising turbulence which may provide an insight into the physics of non classical or statistical turbulent flows keylock et al 2012 2014 in this study the joint probability density function of streamwise and bottom normal velocity fluctuations is used to characterise the probability of occurrence of the instantaneous reynolds stress at a particular point within the flow field kassem et al 2015 stated that the quadrant analysis is used to calculate the intermittency of the instantaneous reynolds stress signals and recognize turbulence structures within a turbulent bursting sequence rigorous laboratory experiments were done previously to resolve the coherent structures of the flow field nolan et al 2010 conducted an experiment on the development of boundary layer on a flat plate subjected to grid generated free stream turbulence and analyzed the quadrant dynamics to identify coherent structures within the flow further longo and losada 2012 reported the contribution of turbulent bursting events using quadrant analysis of random velocity signal for wind generated water waves in a wind tunnel experiment it was found that those structures are quasi periodic and occupy the entire flow field and develop erratically as a part of the burst and the sweep cycle lu and willmarth 1973 nakagawa and nezu 1977 the quadrant threshold technique is used in the present work to determine the contributions of turbulent events to the total shear stress component τ u w ρ u w on the u w plane in this technique one considers the frequency of the occurrence of events and the contribution of each event to the reynolds shear stress from the four quadrants and are defined by 1 out ward interaction q1 i 1 u 0 w 0 occurring when the high speed fluid moves towards the free surface 2 ejection event q2 i 2 u 0 w 0 characterizing the low speed fluid towards the free surface 3 in ward interaction q3 i 3 u 0 w 0 occurring when low speed fluid moves towards the bed and 4 sweep event q4 i 4 u 0 w 0 occurring when high speed fluid towards the bed according to nakagawa and nezu 1977 sukhodolov et al 1988 burst and the sweep cycles occur when u w h u w where h is a threshold level those events are also characterized by their contribution rates c i h to the total reynolds stress eqs 18 and 19 where τ u w indicates the reynolds stress and p q i τ u w are its joint probability density function 18 c i h h τ u w p q i τ u w d τ u w 0 i 2 4 19 c i h h τ u w p q i τ u w d τ u w 0 i 1 3 fig 10 a c represent the contour plots of joint probability density function of u and w at three different heights from the bed at a fixed axial distance on the centre line of the flume i e 11 m from inlet for cases ca current alone fig 11 a i represents the same for wca1 f 1 0 hz wca2 f 1 1 hz and wca3 f 1 2 hz in fig 10 a c it can be seen that the ejection and sweep dominate over the inward and outward interactions in the near bed region fig 10 a b while all the turbulent bursting events have more or less equal contribution to total shear stress further away fig 10 c present results for current only flow are in good agreement with nakagawa and nezu 1977 and sukhodolov et al 1988 however it is interesting to note that the outward and inward interactions start to dominate over ejection and sweep events for all the cases wca1 wca2 and wca3 of superimposed waves against the current in the near bed region as seen in fig 11 a this tendency gradually gets suppressed as the frequency of the wave increases as shown in fig 11 d and g comparison of fig 11 c f and i and fig 10 c for z h 0 51 i e for the region closer to the surface shows that the occurrence of all the bursting events are equally distributed in all the four quadrants fig 10 c with small scale turbulent velocity fluctuations u and w having highest probability whereas these small scale fluctuations are modulated and scaled up into larger scale fluctuations due to superimposition of surface waves acting against the current as a result the contour plots of b u w fig 11 c f and i shows a minimum value close the zero values of u and w and the maximum value of b u w is redistributed on an elliptical path with higher values of u and w fig 12 a c represent the 3 d surface plots of the joint probability density function of u and w at three different heights from the bed at 11 m from the inlet of the flume for current alone case ca further fig 13 a i represents the same for wca1 f 1 0 hz wca2 f 1 1 hz and wca3 f 1 2 hz it can be seen in fig 12 a c that the joint probability distribution b u w has a bell shaped distribution for the only current case ca at all z h it is evident from fig 12 a c that the magnitudes of both u and w are small and also the range of w is smaller compared to the range of u it is pertinent that there is an abundance of the small dissipative scales of fluctuations in stream wise as well as in the bottom normal directions for the current alone case and is in agreement with nakagawa and nezu 1977 moreover near the bed fig 12 a z h 0 01 the u are larger in magnitude compared to u in the near surface region fig 12 c z h 0 51 this is due to the fact that the turbulent fluctuations in the stream wise direction are primarily generated from the bed these are the typical attributes of the b u w for the only current flow e g nakagawa and nezu 1977 however these characteristics are completely altered with the superimposition of the waves as shown in fig 13 a i comparing figs 12 and 13 for the corresponding z h values it can be observed that the presence of the superimposed surface wave clearly changes the bivariate gaussian distribution of b u w to the bimodal distribution in the near bed region figs 12 a and 13 a d and g as evident for all the superimposed frequency cases the effect of the superimposed surface wave is more near the free surface compared to the near bed region it can be seen in fig 13 a c that for wave of frequency f 1 0 hz the b u w spreads out in w direction i e the range of w gets wider and the b u w values approaching u 0 w 0 both from left and right hand side on the number line central region of the uw plane gets smaller as z h increases from the bed the b u w in the central region of the uw plane reduces significantly near the surface at z h 0 51 as shown in fig 13 c f and i as evident a valley region is created with distinct high values of b u w along an elliptical peak range in joint probability distribution plot of u and w for all the wave induced cases it may be noted here that the valley gets wider progressing upward towards the free surface though the valley is not prominent for z h 0 01 close to the bed however the region shows signatures of upward scale shift of turbulent fluctuations clearly this fact is in contrast to the only current case near the free surface as shown in fig 12 c thus it can be said that this change in b u w is solely due to the presence of the superimposed waves against the current it is evident from fig 13 c b and a that the effect of the superimposed wave on b u w is maximum near the free surface region and it gradually weakens as z h decreases it may be due to the fact that the waves have a stronger effect near the surface as compared to the near bed region comparing the b u w plots at a same vertical level from the bed but at different frequencies it is evident that with the increase in the surface wave frequency acting against current the interaction of wave and current is more efficient in the distribution of velocity fluctuation scales more uniformly across the fluctuating spectrum as stated earlier in the near surface region fig 13 c f and i b u w values are distinctly higher along the elliptical peak range in the u w plane literature suggests that for a particle to travel in an elliptical trajectory it must follow the parametric form x 0 ϕ cos t z 0 φ sin t where x 0 and z 0 are the displacements in the x and z directions respectively ϕ and φ are arbitrary constants and t is time thus the velocity components can be written as u x 0 ϕ sin t w z 0 φ sin t π 2 hence the orthogonal components of the velocity of the particle have a phase difference of π 2 between them based on this analogy it can be concluded that there is a phase difference of π 2 between most of the values of u and w the water particles undergo an elliptical orbital motion under the influence of a shallow water wave dean and dalrymple 1991 as a result both u and w instantaneous velocities before phase averaging at a point in the flow against superimposed waves have a visible sinusoidal nature with a phase lag of π 2 between them it may be noted here that the all parameters including b u w presented in the paper have been computed after removal of wave potential component from the raw instantaneous velocity signal the energy from the wave is transferred to the turbulent velocity fluctuations through non linear interactions as evident from fig 13 c f and i for all the three cases wca1 wca2 and wca3 the wave energy interacts primarily with the smaller scale fluctuations and transfers the energy simultaneously to the u and w fluctuation such that they are at a phase lag of π 2 generating the observed elliptical configuration of the peak b u w further it is evident from fig 13 that the effect of the frequency of the superimposed wave is significant it can be clearly observed by comparing fig 13 b with fig 13 e and h that the valley in the central region of the b u w plot becomes wider as the frequency of the superimposed wave increases hence it can be inferred that the high frequency wave e g wca3 with f 1 2 hz has a greater effect on the b u w as compared to the low frequency wave e g wca1 with f 1 0 hz even in the near bed region it is interesting to observe that the higher frequency wave is more efficient in modulating the scale of fluctuations even at regions closer to the bed in comparison to the lower frequency waves for wave acting against the current this observation is in contrast to the linear wave theory wherein it is suggested that for the higher frequency with shorter wavelength the orbital motion of the fluid particles do not reach the bottom with significant strength goda 2010 a similar observation was also recorded recently for waves acting along current wherein it was reported that even in deep water wave cases turbulent fluctuations were modulated close to the bed roy et al 2017 however the effect reduced with the increase in frequency barman et al 2016 2017 and singh et al 2016 based on the above discussion it is observed that the higher frequency wave against current exhibits two distinct opposite characteristics firstly it seems to have a greater effect on b u w near the bed as compared to the low frequency wave secondly it behaves like a deep water wave which has a shallower penetration into the flow the only conclusion that can be drawn from the above discussion is that the presence of a larger wave energy does not solely produce the changes that are observed in b u w fig 13 a i had it been the case the lower frequency waves wca1 with a higher wave energy near the bed would have more strongly affected b u w compared to that of the higher frequency waves wca3 whereas this present result portrays an entirely different phenomenon please see fig 13 a and g wca1 and wca3 hence it may be stated that the frequency of the superimposed waves is the deciding factor in addition to the wave energy in modulating the fluctuating eddies thus due to the superimposition of the waves on the current the b u w corresponding to the large values u increases significantly and at the same time b u w of the small values of u decreases fig 13 a d and g therefore the waves tend to modulate the small scale disturbances strongly in the stream wise direction this confirms the decrease in pdf of the small scales of u and w is significant in the presence of waves fig 8 j k and l compared to that of the current alone case fig 8 i 3 6 distribution of turbulent eddies it is gestated from the above results and discussions that the superimposed surface wave acting against current considerably modulates the eddy structure inside the flow field kassem et al 2015 noted that the fourier analysis may be used for studying turbulent flows and understand the integral scales of motion in the frequency domain however the fourier analysis is incapable of resolving the inherent futures of statistically intermittent eddy structures of multiple scales that vary in space and time berry and greenwood 1975 whereas the wavelet analysis is capable of resolving a time series into time frequency space and thus may be used for the characterisation of the localised intermittent oscillations of turbulent structures farge 1992 grinsted et al 2004 de stefano and vasilyev 2012 and kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 reported that the wavelet analysis may be effectively used for performing multi scale decomposition and classifying and separating localised structures for example vortices in physical and wave number spaces farge et al 2001 2003 khujadze et al 2011 further wavelet analysis is performed for studying localised deviations of power within a time series daubechies 1990 grinsted et al 2004 torrence and compo 1998 in order to highlight the distinctiveness of eddy scale distributions based on the velocity fluctuations wavelet analysis is presented herein wang et al 2016 stated that the wavelet analysis of random signals is capable of giving information on the eddy scale and their associated occurrence frequency further for large reynolds number flows the length scale of eddies illustrate a broad range of the spectral band roy et al 2017 the current experiments were carried out with significant flow reynolds numbers re 3 55 104 wavelet analysis shows the velocity signal in the wavelet scale or pseudo frequency f p which is extracted by disintegrating the signal into flexibly sized time casement in wavelet analysis the scale to frequency is associated to determine the central frequency of the wavelet f ct based on the following relationship f p f c t d δ where d is a scale δ is the sampling period f ct is the center frequency of a wavelet in hz f is the pseudo frequency corresponding to the scale d in hz the concept is to relate a purely periodic signal of frequency f ct with a given wavelet short time fourier transform can acquire the time information but the range of the time window is constant for this purpose continuous wavelet transforms cwt of a signal s t i may be characterized by a family of wavelet functions e g roy et al 2017 that can be written as 20 ϖ l d 1 d s t i ψ t r d d t where ϖ is the wavelet coefficient l is the position time or space d is the wavelet scale the symbol represents the conjugated value ψ is the mother wavelet function wang et al 2016 the wavelet function is capable of expanding and changing the scale d and hence investigates the location t which corresponds to a particular scale of d the first fourier transform fft of a convolution in the time domain equals the point wise multiplication in the frequency domain wang et al 2016 hence the wavelet coefficient ϖ physically suggests the degree of correspondence between signal s t i and the wavelet function it is the simplest tool to study the full signal at different scales and positions in time or space domain by altering the parameters d and l an eddy can be explained as a function of time and scale frequency through the wavelet coefficient roy et al 2017 li and nozaki 1995 further the location of the highest valued wavelet coefficient depicts the large scale eddy the morlet wavelet is applied herein to distinguish the eddy scales based on the magnitudes of the wavelet coefficients similar to roy et al 2017 torrence and compo 1998 stated that errors would arise at the commencement and culmination of the wavelet power spectrum for a finite length time series generally known as the coi cone of influence they provided one solution to eliminate these cone effect that is to pad the end of the time series with zeroes before performing the wavelet transform and then remove them afterwards also the time series data was padded with adequate zeroes to carry the total signal length up to the next higher power of two this technique is very helpful to speed up the transform and bound edge effects kassem et al 2015 however torrence and compo 1998 noted that there is no need to pad with zeroes for cyclic series evolving no coi please note that as the present experiment deals with cyclic data series and focused on the temporal evolution of the particular peak frequencies and thus coi was not present earlier discussions suggest that the modulating capacity of the velocity fluctuation scales is maximum for the maximum frequency wave studied herein the wca3 case thus in this section we focus our discussion on the changes induced in the eddy structure for the wave acting against the current for the wca3 case in comparison to the current alone case at three different z h 0 51 fig 14 0 12 fig 15 0 01 fig 16 fig 14 b represents the contour plot of wavelet coefficients for only current flow ca in the upper region of the flow z h 0 51 and fig 14 e represents the same for wca3 f 1 2 hz fig 14 a and d represent the instantaneous velocity profiles at a particular point in both the cases it may be noted that the instantaneous velocity profile is shown in fig 14 d has not been phase averaged and is provided only for the purpose of illustration of the raw signal on the contrary the wavelet analysis is done by using the phase averaged velocity data by removing the wave potential term at a particular point fig 14 c and f represent the fft output of the phase averaged velocity fluctuations for comparison with pseudo frequency at which the different scales of eddies exist it is evident from fig 14 b and c that the energy containing eddies for the only current flow ca is having a pseudo frequency f p in the range of 0 1 hz however with the superimposition of the wave all the energy containing large scale eddies are modified and are now contained in a narrow range of the pseudo frequency i e f p 0 8 1 3 hz the peak value of the corresponding fft output is observed at f 1 2 hz i e at the frequency of the superimposed wave fig 14 e and f even though the wavelet coefficient computation has been carried out on the raw velocity signal after removal of the wave component thus it can be concluded that the superimposed wave of frequency f 1 2 hz is modulating the entire range of velocity fluctuations thus the whole spectrum of eddy scales associated in the current alone case as a result it is seen that the large scale eddies with large values of wavelet coefficients are concentrated at a pseudo frequency f p 1 2 hz which is similar to that of the frequency of the superimposed wave fig 15 shows the same plots as those presented in fig 14 but at z h 0 12 it can be observed in fig 15 b that the large scale energy containing eddies are confined to a pseudo frequency range f p 0 0 6 hz and are randomly distributed in the time domain it can be observed from fig 15 e that the superimposed wave is weakly modulating the eddies with f p 1 2 hz represented by a smaller wavelet coefficient at that particular frequency in comparison to the corresponding case for z h 0 51 further comparison of fig 15 b and 15 e reveals that the superimposed wave modulated the energy levels of the fluctuations of all scales eddy scales fig 16 represents the same plots as those present in figs 14 and 15 but at the region very close to the bed z h 0 01 it can be observed in fig 16 b that the large scale energy containing eddies are confined to a pseudo frequency range f p 0 0 6 hz and are randomly distributed in the time domain for the only current case comparison of fig 16 e for wca3 with that of fig 16 b for ca suggests that the superimposed wave is faintly modulating the eddies represented at f p 1 2 hz that are represented by a smaller wavelet coefficient however it may be noted that even at a region close to the bed the energy distribution structure across different frequencies is largely affected by wave acting against the current 4 conclusions the wave against the current is related to the tidal wave current combined flow few experiments and numerical investigations have been carried out in the past to explore the interaction of the waves propagating in the opposite direction to that of the current in the context of understanding the interaction turbulence structure also the higher order moments of the velocity fluctuations remained unexplored understanding the cross correlation of the fluctuations of two individual velocity components has a great importance in understanding the effects of the wave acting against the current on the various scales of eddies associated with the flow recently kassem et al 2015 performed an experiment with the aim to understand the spatial time and scale frequency interactions among wave generated boundary layer and event driven sediment transport under uneven shoaling and breaking waves in the nearshore of a prototype sandy barrier beach they found that the turbulent clusters in the uw plane have the highest power that distributed across the lower frequency range for the transverse standing wave however the propagation of the surface waves and the direction of the mean current flow was faintly discussed in kassem et al 2015 thus this paper is focussed on understanding the underlying mechanism behind the interaction between the waves and the turbulent eddies the primary conclusions from the present study are given as for a flow with wave against the current the mean velocity near the surface increases compared to the mean velocity of the only current flow this tendency of increasing the mean velocity of flow penetrates deeper into the flow for a higher frequency wave it is evident that the vertical velocity distributions of the present experimental data follow the similar trend as that of the existing model of yuan and madsen 2015 the reynolds stress reaches a maximum near the bed and gradually reduces towards the water surface the vertical turbulent intensity near the bed reduces due to the superimposition of the wave the higher frequency waves convert the smaller eddies into larger ones more strongly compared to the lower frequency waves this effect is more pronounced for fluctuations of velocity in the vertical direction as compared to the stream wise direction the maximum value of the probability density of the vertical velocity fluctuations decreases with the increase in the vertical distance from the bed this maximum value decays logarithmically as a function of superimposed wave frequency it can also be inferred that the scale of eddies increases near the surface due to the superimposed surface waves further the smaller fluctuations are more prone to modulation by the higher frequency waves the high frequency wave has a greater effect on the joint probability density function of the streamwise and vertical velocity fluctuations as compared to the low frequency wave even in the near bed region the frequency of the superimposed waves is the deciding factor in addition to the wave energy in modulating the fluctuating eddies finally it can be stated that the high frequency waves are better at partially inhibiting the small scale fluctuations and enhancing the medium scale fluctuations in the stream wise direction in order words the interaction between the waves and the small scale fluctuations becomes stronger as the frequency of the superimposed waves increases the modulation process becomes stronger across all frequencies as the elevation from the bed increases the superimposed wave modulates the large scale energy containing eddies which have a pseudo frequency similar to that of the frequency of the superimposed wave acknowledgements the author would like to

23631,this paper shows the behaviour of different eddy scales that are modulated by the various frequencies of the superimposed wave acting against the current flow it is observed that the mean velocity near the surface increases due to surface wave acting against current compared to the mean velocity of the only current flow moreover flow under the influence of the higher frequency waves results in larger scale velocity fluctuations when compared to the lower frequency waves the effect of the superimposed wave is more pronounced for velocity fluctuations in the vertical direction compare to that of the stream wise direction the peak value of the probability density function pdf of vertical velocity fluctuation decreases logarithmically with the increase in the elevation of the bed interestingly the frequency of the superimposed waves is the major parameter in modulating the eddy scales further it is observed that the frequency of the large scale energy containing eddies obtained from the wavelet transform is similar to that of the frequency of the superimposed wave itself even after removal of wave potential component in the random velocity signal keywords eddies pdf reynolds stress joint pdf wavelet analysis against wave 1 introduction the knowledge of the interaction between wave and current is crucial for marine environments the wave current combined flow near the surface affects loading on offshore structures mei et al 1989 near the bed the wave current interaction is responsible for transporting sediment wherein the waves pick up the sediments and the current carries it whitehouse 1998 also the information about the attenuation of waves is helpful for protecting the shores the currents can be ocean currents as well as tidal currents the work on wave current interaction has been going on for decades although several investigations have been carried out in the study of waves and currents separately little was known about the way in which the combined flows interact especially close to the bed initial work on wave current combined flow was done by einstein 1948 he suggested that the sand transportation by waves could be similar to that for uniform flow some of the multifaceted problems of bottom surface friction and energy dissipation in a superimposed wave on current has been studied by jonsson 1966 further bijker 1966 studied the variation of the bed shear of a current due to wave motion later work on wave following current was done by van hoften and karaki 1977 wherein experiments on validation of the theoretical models for wave amplitude attenuation and mean velocity changes for waves of single frequency propagating with a current were carried out kemp and simons 1983 performed experiments to investigate the mean velocity profile for waves against a current they reported that the measured velocity departs from the logarithmic law close to the bed gradually increases and finally becomes more than that of the only current case in addition turbulent intensities increase due to the superposition of waves against a current similar results were obtained by van der kaaij and nieuwjaar 1987 and van kampen and nap 1988 under irregular waves current combined environment van rijn et al 1993 concluded that the waves cause a decrease in velocity near the free surface for waves following current and an increase in an opposing current nielsen and you 1997 put forward a theoretical model for the profile of the eulerian mean velocity induced by wave current interactions using a 2 d stress balance concept further dingemans et al 1997 tried to explain the changes in mean velocity profile for wave current combined flow using secondary local circulations by craik leibovich vortex forces this was later supported by experiments performed by klopman 1997 groeneweg and klopman 1998 and groeneweg and battjes 1999 used the generalized lagrangian mean glm formulation to investigate the change of the eulerian mean velocity due to the superimposition of the wave out of all the experimental investigations mentioned above only kemp and simons 1983 and klopman 1994 both conducted experiments for the whole water depth and primarily focussed on the mean velocity changes when the waves acted against the current in their experiments kemp and simons 1983 used 1 hz frequency waves and klopman 1994 used 0 7 hz frequency waves it may be pointed out here that the influence of wave acting against the current on the turbulence characteristics of the background current was not investigated in these studies moreover both these studies were carried out with a wave of a single frequency and thus the effect of the varying wave frequencies on the flow characteristics remained unexplored later umeyama 2005 performed a series of experiments where wave height and wave period were varied in different tests experiments were carried out for the only current case waves following current and waves against the current the mean velocity in the channel was about 12 cm s both along current and against current cases vertical profiles of mean velocity and reynolds shear stress were measured at a distance of 10 5 m from the wave generator a significant reduction of the mean velocity was observed up to mid water depth from the water surface for waves acting against the current further the reynolds stress decreased throughout the water depth for the combined wave current environment for both the cases waves acting along and against the current when compared to the only current case several theoretical models have been proposed for the estimation of bed shear stress and the angle between the wave and current e g sleath 1991 many more studies were concerned with the non linear interactions and their effect on velocity structures e g hedges et al 1985 dingemans et al 1997 smith 2006 zhang et al 2014 despite all the investigations mentioned above only a few studies went into the studying of the mechanics of the interaction between the waves and the current acting against each other according to hussain 1986 a coherent structure is a connected turbulent fluid mass with instantaneously phase correlated vorticity over its spatial extent this definition depicts that the coherent structures are characterised as coherent vorticity that may have distinct boundaries and independent regions later adrian and marusic 2012 stated that coherent motions are frequent and are known as turbulent eddies these motions characterize the flow and play significant role in defining the mean flow stress and other statistical properties it may be mentioned here that singh et al 2016 studied in detail the turbulent coherent structures for waves acting along current environment however these studies have not focussed deeply into the understanding of the hidden mechanisms of the modulation of turbulent structures due to the superimposed surface waves on the current thus understanding the underlying mechanisms and characteristics of the turbulent eddies in both space and time domain within the wave current combined environment is an interesting area for exploration farge 1992 reported that a wavelet transform is an efficient tool for the characterization of a random signal in both space and time domain camussi and gui 1997 carried out the orthonormal wavelet decomposition for grid generated turbulent and turbulent jet flow and showed the distribution of coherent structures further longo 2003 quantified the turbulent kinetic energy and the coherent structures using orthogonal wavelets for spilling waves later on longo 2009 reported the pre breaking monochromatic waves using orthogonal wavelets recently roy et al 2017 studied the distribution of turbulent eddy scales for waves acting along the current using wavelet transform modulation of turbulent structures due to the presence of any external influence is an important area of research and thus many studies have focused on this subject literature reveals that the studies mainly focussed on the effect of large scale turbulent structures on a small scale which could be manifested through modulation of either amplitude or frequency rao et al 1971 stated that the dynamics of the energy balance within a turbulent boundary layer might be characterized through a coupling between the inner and outer layer turbulent structures sandborn 1959 batchelor and townsend 1949 observed that the bursting of turbulence structures are associated with the well known phenomenon of intermittency in the small scale structures of turbulence this turbulent bursting comprises the low speed and high speed events further hutchins and marusic 2007 studied the wall turbulence and noted that a large reynolds number flow consists of several large fluctuations or superstructure events high speed events they also observed that the superstructures are not simply superimposed as a low wavenumber in the near wall region somewhat they seem to dynamically modulate the production of the turbulent scales within the near wall region ganapathisubramani et al 2012 studied the wall turbulence and showed that the small scale amplitude computed as the mean square of the small scale signal increases with increasing large scale fluctuations from negative to positive in the near wall regions on the contrary the small scale amplitude decreases with increasing large scale fluctuation away from the wall this clearly reveals that the increasing strength of the large scale fluctuations is capable of modulating the amplitude of a turbulent signal however as per authors knowledge there is a few work reported on the characteristics of the modulated random velocity fluctuation due to waves acting against the current thus the intention of the present investigation is to get an insight into the distribution of turbulent eddies for wave against current flow in this paper normalized phase averaged turbulent mean velocity intensity reynolds shear stress and pdf of streamwise and vertical velocity components are presented for waves acting against current environment furthermore the joint probability density function pdf of streamwise and vertical velocity fluctuations is presented also the wavelet transform of the random velocity fluctuations is computed to get an improved idea towards the distribution of turbulent eddies due to superimposed surface waves acting against the current overall this paper is focussed on presenting a picture of how the wave frequency modulates the time and length scales of the turbulent eddies within the flow field for waves acting against the current 2 experiments and data analysis 2 1 experimental set up the experiments were carried out at fluid mechanics and hydraulics laboratory fmhl department of aerospace engineering and applied mechanics iiest shibpur in a flume of length 18 m and cross section of 0 9 m by 0 9 m with a slope of 0 00025 fig 1 a vertical reciprocating plunger type wavemaker was installed near the outlet of the flume for more details about the mechanism of the wave maker please see barman et al 2016 and roy et al 2017 2 2 measurement technique a sontek 16 mhz micro acoustic doppler velocimeter micro adv was used to measure the instantaneous velocity of the fluid flow the measurement location has been chosen at a distance of 11 m from the inlet of the flume a discharge control valve maintained the water supply into the flume the data were measured for 3 min at each measuring point the size of the sampling volume of the 16 mhz micro adv is 0 09 cm3 the accuracy of the adv is 1 0 of the observed velocity the discharge control valve and the tailgate were adjusted to allow for maintaining the desired flow depth h at a particular discharge the depth was continuously monitored manually all through the experiment against marked scales fastened to the perspex wall at the test section also an abs digimatic depth gauge manufactured by mitutoyo model no vds 60dc code no 571 205 10 was attached to a traversing trolley for more accurate measurements a flow meter at the pump delivery section was used for continuous monitoring of the discharge also an electronic relay is connected to the power input of the pump for maintaining constant power supply before the present experimental campaign was carried out velocity measurements with acoustic doppler velocimeter undertaken at a different time at the test section for a particular discharge recorded by flowmeter gave almost constant mean velocity and r m s velocity deviation less than 1 an ideal seeding material for peak sensitivity of the adv measurements to maintain the desired signal to noise ratio should have the mean seeding particle diameter of 10 20 μm sontek ysi inc 2007 in the present experiment we have used kaolinite clay as tracer particles of mean particle size 15 μm please note that the water in the sump was stirred every 30 min to keep the seeding particles in suspension and thus to achieve the desired signal to noise ratio 20 for all measurements three different cases wca1 wca2 and wca3 with a superimposed wave of frequencies f 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 hz were used against the current for the present study and the results were compared with ca current alone i e without superimposed surface waves the choice of the frequency range i e f 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 hz of the superimposed waves was made considering two major factors firstly for waves acting against the current with frequency f 1 5 hz the wave train was observed to become distorted and was unable to sustain for the entire length of the flume against the current on the contrary for smaller frequencies f 0 7 hz the waves were not prominently seen probably this is the reason why the previous investigations on wave acting against current were also reported in the frequency ranging from 0 7 f 1 2 measurement of the velocity components was performed at fifteen points in the vertical direction at the test location as shown in fig 2 for a flow with wave against the current the points were chosen more densely near the bed so as to obtain a clear picture of the near bed turbulence structure waves were generated against the mean flow reynolds number re u h ν 3 55 104 where u represents the depth average mean streamwise velocity h is the water depth and ν is the kinematic viscosity the wavemaker was present at 7 m further downstream of the test section the water depth was maintained at 16 5 cm for all the four different test cases the frequency of the wave maker was controlled by changing the voltage of the input supply to the motor of the wave maker using an electronic variac the instantaneous velocity data was acquired by the adv with a sampling frequency of 40 hz and were stored directly on the computer and were later processed for more details on hydrodynamic parameters please see tables 1 and 2 2 3 theoretical methodology the instantaneous velocity components for waves following current can be obtain as 1 u t u u t u v t v v t v w t w w t w where u t u t u v t v t v w t w t w the overhead bar denotes the time averaged velocity overhead tilde denotes wave induced velocity and a prime denotes the velocity fluctuations the wave induced velocity u t is obtained by subtracting the time averaged velocity u from the ensemble average velocity u t for the wave current combined flow the corresponding normalized streamwise and transverse phase average velocity can be written as 2 u ˆ u t u w ˆ w t u for wave against a current the normalized phase averaged stream wise turbulence intensities are given by the equation 3 u 1 n t 0 n u t u t 2 u where n total number of observation periods further the normalized phase averaged reynolds shear stress in xz plane is defined by 4 τ u w ρ u w ρ n t 0 n u t u t w t w t the estimation of the phase averaged turbulence parameters are similar to umeyama 2005 and barman et al 2016 to test whether the signals were repeatable and ergodic for wave current combined flow the wave reflections in the laboratory flume are analyzed herein the normalized errors δ u n of the squared magnitude of the mean velocity obtained with n 120 realizations for a given phase were calculated at a point z h 0 2 as similar to melville et al 2002 mattioli et al 2012 2013 5 δ u n u n u 120 2 u 120 2 where u n represent the n number of phase average velocity and u 120 is the 120th number of phase average velocity fig 3 shows the distributions of the normalized error δ u n of mean velocity as a function of realization n at z h 0 2 for f 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 hz mattioli et al 2013 reported that the normalized error was approximately 3 after 80 realizations for the all tested waves it is observed from fig 3 that for n 60 the velocity record shows negligible scattering effect δ u n 3 3 5 and 4 for f 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 hz respectively a similar test was carried out for different locations in the test section that gave similar results not shown here thus the present results are in good agreement with the results of mattioli et al 2013 an estimation of the uncertainty for statistical turbulence parameters is necessary for having information on the data quality pertaining to statistical errors arising due to the physical constraint of the measurement technique used by the instrument as well as uncertainties associated with the boundary conditions the estimates of the variance errors of the sample mean and variance for uncorrelated samples applicable for any statistical parameter distribution can be defined as garcía et al 2005 6 ζ mean ζ u n mef 7 ζ var 2 n vef ζ u where ζ u represents the sample variance of the variable u 8 n mef t t 2 t s 9 n vef t t t s where t t is the total sampling time and ts is the integral time scale using autocorrelation method moving block bootstrap mbb technique garcía et al 2006 is a conventional tool for quantification of the uncertainty with 95 confidence intervals for each turbulence parameter and is used herein for uncertainty analysis an essential parameter in the mbb technique is the optimum length of the block politis and white 2004 and garcía et al 2005 reported that the optimum block length could be estimated based on the observed autocorrelation function of each recorded signal in this present study the optimum block length is estimated using the method proposed by politis and white 2004 and garcía et al 2006 the synthetic data set was computed using mbb method for a wide range of flow conditions 3 55 10 4 re 12 37 10 4 velocity signal in each coordinate direction was synthesized with 1000 replications each of 3 min time duration with data intervals at 40 hz frequency here as a sample case we show the data computed at a distance 11 m from the flume inlet in a particular point z h 0 4 fig 4 a and b show the error variance of the sample mean and variance respectively these parameters were computed for each signal based on mbb technique and the values are plotted as a function of the values obtained from experimental data using eqs 6 and 7 it is noted that the average relative error of the standard error of the sample mean is approximately 3 6 for the sample variance the average relative error is obtained as 14 5 fig 4 a and b reveals that a good agreement between the signal synthesised by mbb technique and that from eqs 6 and 7 is evident fig 4 c and d shows the comparison plots between probability distribution of the ts and u mean computed from the experimental data and using mbb technique the error values for both the parameters as shown in fig 4 c and d are 13 3 results and discussion 3 1 mean velocity profile the vertical distribution of the normalised mean stream wise velocity u u u is shown in fig 5 the profile of u for the only current flow follows the logarithmic law as shown by the dashed line in fig 5 it is observed in fig 5 that due to the superimposed surface waves against the current u starts to deviate from the log law as observed from fig 5 a b and c the deviation in u starts to increase toward the free surface these results for different frequencies are in a good argument with the results produced by umeyama 2005 and kemp and simons 1983 which suggested that there will be an increase in u near the surface in a flow with wave against the current the reason for the increase in the mean velocity is the wave induced mass transport phenomena as mentioned in kemp and simons 1983 it can also be inferred that the energy loss due to the wave attenuation is larger for a wave opposing current compared to the wave following current case kemp and simons 1983 this energy loss can be related to the increase in mean velocity the u profile with respect to the variation in the wave frequency is shown in fig 5 a c it can also be observed in fig 5 a c that the vertical position z h at which the stream wise mean velocity deviates positive from the log law dashed line moves closer to the bed as the frequency of the superimposed waves becomes smaller this shows that the penetration of the wave induced mass transport phenomena due to a lower frequency wave e g fig 5 a is deeper into the current in the vertical direction compared to the higher frequency wave e g fig 5 c this result is also in good agreement with umeyama 2005 recently yuan and madsen 2015 proposed a model for eddy viscosity and velocity distribution as a function of vertical distance for currents in present of superimposed surface waves fig 5 d shows a comparative study of the vertical distributions of streamwise velocity having different superimposed wave frequency with the existing model proposed by yuan and madsen 2015 it is evident from fig 5 d that the vertical velocity distributions of the present experimental data follow the similar trend as that of the existing model yuan and madsen 2015 however there is a little deviation of velocity values observed at the upper region z h 0 4 to 0 8 and close to the bed z h 0 01 to 0 04 these deviations may be due to the differences in the background experimental conditions such as flume bed material generation of waves and direction of flow e g yuan and madsen 2015 used marble bed 3 2 turbulent intensities fig 6 a d shows the vertical and stream wise phase averaged turbulent intensity w and u as a function of z h for four different cases the u is much higher than w for all the cases throughout the water depth the frequency of the superimposed waves is similar to that of umeyama 2005 for cases wca1 and wca2 there is negligible variation in u and w due to change in frequency of the waves throughout the water depth fig 6 d shows the variation of u and w with z h for frequency 1 2 hz the vertical distribution of u and w wca3 fig 6 d maintain a similar trend as that of wca1 and wca2 fig 6 b and c it can be stated from fig 6 a d that the vertical distribution of the turbulence intensity profiles shows a small increase due to the superimposed surface waves against the current cases wca1 wca2 and wca3 as compared to the current alone case ca throughout the water depth 3 3 reynolds stresses the vertical distribution of the phase averaged normalised reynolds stress u w τ u w u 2 is shown in fig 7 a d for four different cases ca wca1 wca2 and wca3 and are compared with the normalised stress profiles of umeyama 2005 it is evident from fig 7 a d that the reynolds stress remains positive throughout the water depth and it attains a maximum value at a small distance above the bed for all the cases further u w decreases due to the superimposition of the surface wave against the current wca1 wca2 and wca3 as compared to the current alone case ca it can also be seen that with the increase of the frequency of the wave there is a small decrease in u w near the bed fig 7 d shows a similar trend of u w for wca3 f 1 2 hz as that of wca1 f 1 0 hz and wca2 f 1 1 hz the present experimental results are in good agreement with umeyama 2005 3 4 distribution of probability density function of the velocity fluctuations the pdf of stream wise and vertical velocity fluctuations are computed based on the method described in tennekes and lumley 1972 fig 8 shows the variation of the probability density function pdf of the stream wise velocity fluctuations u and the vertical velocity fluctuations w for four different cases ca wca1 wca2 and wca3 at three different elevations from the bed z h 0 01 0 12 0 51 please note that for clarity of presentation all data in each of the pdf plots were interpolated using cubic splines de boor et al 1978 generally for the stream wise velocity measured for a particular point the statistical moment of nth order can be computed as e g czernuszenko and rowiński 2008 roy and debnath 2017 10 φ u t n u t n p u t u t d u where φ represents the expected value p u is the pdf and n 1 2 3 for a stationary ergodic process φ u n is easy to the manifestation 11 φ u t n u t n lim t 1 t t 0 t 0 t u n d t where the indicates a phase averaged value t t 0 is the initial time of a particular phase and t duration of the phase it is assumed that all the data series are stationary and ergodic therefore to estimate the pdf eq 11 is used herein the characteristics of the distribution of velocity fluctuations can be evaluated from the mean root mean square rms the skewness s u and kurtosis k u and are defined as rinne 2010 12 u r m s σ u t u t 2 s u u t u t 3 σ 3 k u u t u t 4 σ 4 here su and ku represent the skewness and kurtosis of the p u similarly sw and kw represent the skewness and kurtosis of the p w in general it can be observed from fig 8 a l that the smaller fluctuations of w are more prominent than that of u for all the cases it may be due to the constant influx of the large fluctuations u in the flow direction due to the mean flow fig 8 a e and i represent the only current case ca and it is evident that the peak values of both p u and p w are almost similar for all the vertical positions z h 0 01 0 12 and 0 51 fig 8 a e and i whereas for wca1 f 1 0 hz fig 8 b f and j it can be clearly observed that the peak value of the pdf of both u and w decreases as the distance from the bed increases and the surface wave has a significant influence on the distribution of velocity fluctuations it can be observed that smaller values of both u and w are redistributed and the turbulent velocity fluctuations dominate the flow it is important to note here that the peak value of the pdf of w p max w decrease more significantly compared to that of p max u a similar observation is also evident for wca2 fig 6 c g and k and wca3 fig 6 d h and l fig 9 shows the variation of p max w as a function of z h for ca wca1 wca2 and wca3 it is interesting to notice that the distribution of p max w as a function of z h follows the logarithmic function given by 13 p max w a λ ln z h here the values of the coefficients a and λ are shown in table 3 it can be seen that λ is negative for wca1 wca2 and wca3 this suggests a logarithmic decay of p max w as z h increases for the cases with superimposed waves there is no such trend of the p max w values for the current alone case ca it can also be observed in table 3 that the decay rate λ decreases by a small amount as the frequency of the superimposed waves increases the rate at which the p max w decreases with the increase in the distance from the bed slows down when the frequency of the superimposed wave increases the decrease in pdf of the small scales of u is significant in the presence of waves fig 8 b d compared to that of the current alone case fig 8 a there is a small change in the p u with the change in frequency of the wave fig 8 b d the decrease in the peak values of the pdf of both u and w due to the presence of waves is more pronounced near the free surface fig 8 j l as compared to the near bed region fig 8 b d it can also be inferred that the scale of the eddies increases near the surface due to the superimposed surface waves and the effect is transported towards the bed in a progressive manner the decrease in the peak value of pdf and its distribution within the area under the curve means wave energy is acting against current modulates the smaller scale fluctuations to a larger fluctuation band through cascading process ganapathisubramani et al 2012 studied the wall turbulence problem and noted that small scale amplitude increases with increasing value of the large scale fluctuations in the near wall region results of the present study and the study of ganapathisubramani et al 2012 clearly depicts that the external influences e g wall roughness bluff body superimposed surface waves etc on the incident turbulent flow are capable of modulating small scale amplitudes moreover the peak value of the pdf of w especially in cases of fig 8 f h appears to decrease with increasing frequency rapidly in comparison to the peak value of the pdf of u this shows that the small fluctuations are more modulated by the waves acting against the current 3 5 joint probability density function the joint probability distribution provides information on the probability of the occurrence of stream wise and transverse velocity fluctuations within any particular range or discrete set of values specified for these variables jointly following the methodology of sukhodolov et al 1988 the joint probability density function b u w is estimated herein the characteristic function ξ α β for the estimation of the joint probability density function b u w of the streamwise and vertical velocity fluctuations are defined as 14 ξ α β exp i u α w β b u w d u d w where α and β are its arguments using an inverse transform of equation 14 in which the terms of ξ α β less than fourth order are taken into account b u w can be written as sukhodolov et al 1988 15 b u w 1 2 π exp i u α v β ξ α β d α d β 16 b u w ψ u w 1 a b 3 4 q a b a b k a b u w where q ab is the cumulant abe 1993 here ψ u w is the gaussian distribution for two variables and k a b is a kernel polynomial of the order a b and is defined as 17 ψ u w 1 2 π 1 τ 2 exp u 2 2 τ u w w 2 2 1 τ 2 where τ u w u 2 is the correlation coefficient equation 16 represents a joint probability density distribution of the gram charlier type for the bivariate case the intermittent joint velocity structures of any turbulent flow can be computed from the time series data of two different velocity components collected from a particular point in the flow field that can be used for categorising turbulence which may provide an insight into the physics of non classical or statistical turbulent flows keylock et al 2012 2014 in this study the joint probability density function of streamwise and bottom normal velocity fluctuations is used to characterise the probability of occurrence of the instantaneous reynolds stress at a particular point within the flow field kassem et al 2015 stated that the quadrant analysis is used to calculate the intermittency of the instantaneous reynolds stress signals and recognize turbulence structures within a turbulent bursting sequence rigorous laboratory experiments were done previously to resolve the coherent structures of the flow field nolan et al 2010 conducted an experiment on the development of boundary layer on a flat plate subjected to grid generated free stream turbulence and analyzed the quadrant dynamics to identify coherent structures within the flow further longo and losada 2012 reported the contribution of turbulent bursting events using quadrant analysis of random velocity signal for wind generated water waves in a wind tunnel experiment it was found that those structures are quasi periodic and occupy the entire flow field and develop erratically as a part of the burst and the sweep cycle lu and willmarth 1973 nakagawa and nezu 1977 the quadrant threshold technique is used in the present work to determine the contributions of turbulent events to the total shear stress component τ u w ρ u w on the u w plane in this technique one considers the frequency of the occurrence of events and the contribution of each event to the reynolds shear stress from the four quadrants and are defined by 1 out ward interaction q1 i 1 u 0 w 0 occurring when the high speed fluid moves towards the free surface 2 ejection event q2 i 2 u 0 w 0 characterizing the low speed fluid towards the free surface 3 in ward interaction q3 i 3 u 0 w 0 occurring when low speed fluid moves towards the bed and 4 sweep event q4 i 4 u 0 w 0 occurring when high speed fluid towards the bed according to nakagawa and nezu 1977 sukhodolov et al 1988 burst and the sweep cycles occur when u w h u w where h is a threshold level those events are also characterized by their contribution rates c i h to the total reynolds stress eqs 18 and 19 where τ u w indicates the reynolds stress and p q i τ u w are its joint probability density function 18 c i h h τ u w p q i τ u w d τ u w 0 i 2 4 19 c i h h τ u w p q i τ u w d τ u w 0 i 1 3 fig 10 a c represent the contour plots of joint probability density function of u and w at three different heights from the bed at a fixed axial distance on the centre line of the flume i e 11 m from inlet for cases ca current alone fig 11 a i represents the same for wca1 f 1 0 hz wca2 f 1 1 hz and wca3 f 1 2 hz in fig 10 a c it can be seen that the ejection and sweep dominate over the inward and outward interactions in the near bed region fig 10 a b while all the turbulent bursting events have more or less equal contribution to total shear stress further away fig 10 c present results for current only flow are in good agreement with nakagawa and nezu 1977 and sukhodolov et al 1988 however it is interesting to note that the outward and inward interactions start to dominate over ejection and sweep events for all the cases wca1 wca2 and wca3 of superimposed waves against the current in the near bed region as seen in fig 11 a this tendency gradually gets suppressed as the frequency of the wave increases as shown in fig 11 d and g comparison of fig 11 c f and i and fig 10 c for z h 0 51 i e for the region closer to the surface shows that the occurrence of all the bursting events are equally distributed in all the four quadrants fig 10 c with small scale turbulent velocity fluctuations u and w having highest probability whereas these small scale fluctuations are modulated and scaled up into larger scale fluctuations due to superimposition of surface waves acting against the current as a result the contour plots of b u w fig 11 c f and i shows a minimum value close the zero values of u and w and the maximum value of b u w is redistributed on an elliptical path with higher values of u and w fig 12 a c represent the 3 d surface plots of the joint probability density function of u and w at three different heights from the bed at 11 m from the inlet of the flume for current alone case ca further fig 13 a i represents the same for wca1 f 1 0 hz wca2 f 1 1 hz and wca3 f 1 2 hz it can be seen in fig 12 a c that the joint probability distribution b u w has a bell shaped distribution for the only current case ca at all z h it is evident from fig 12 a c that the magnitudes of both u and w are small and also the range of w is smaller compared to the range of u it is pertinent that there is an abundance of the small dissipative scales of fluctuations in stream wise as well as in the bottom normal directions for the current alone case and is in agreement with nakagawa and nezu 1977 moreover near the bed fig 12 a z h 0 01 the u are larger in magnitude compared to u in the near surface region fig 12 c z h 0 51 this is due to the fact that the turbulent fluctuations in the stream wise direction are primarily generated from the bed these are the typical attributes of the b u w for the only current flow e g nakagawa and nezu 1977 however these characteristics are completely altered with the superimposition of the waves as shown in fig 13 a i comparing figs 12 and 13 for the corresponding z h values it can be observed that the presence of the superimposed surface wave clearly changes the bivariate gaussian distribution of b u w to the bimodal distribution in the near bed region figs 12 a and 13 a d and g as evident for all the superimposed frequency cases the effect of the superimposed surface wave is more near the free surface compared to the near bed region it can be seen in fig 13 a c that for wave of frequency f 1 0 hz the b u w spreads out in w direction i e the range of w gets wider and the b u w values approaching u 0 w 0 both from left and right hand side on the number line central region of the uw plane gets smaller as z h increases from the bed the b u w in the central region of the uw plane reduces significantly near the surface at z h 0 51 as shown in fig 13 c f and i as evident a valley region is created with distinct high values of b u w along an elliptical peak range in joint probability distribution plot of u and w for all the wave induced cases it may be noted here that the valley gets wider progressing upward towards the free surface though the valley is not prominent for z h 0 01 close to the bed however the region shows signatures of upward scale shift of turbulent fluctuations clearly this fact is in contrast to the only current case near the free surface as shown in fig 12 c thus it can be said that this change in b u w is solely due to the presence of the superimposed waves against the current it is evident from fig 13 c b and a that the effect of the superimposed wave on b u w is maximum near the free surface region and it gradually weakens as z h decreases it may be due to the fact that the waves have a stronger effect near the surface as compared to the near bed region comparing the b u w plots at a same vertical level from the bed but at different frequencies it is evident that with the increase in the surface wave frequency acting against current the interaction of wave and current is more efficient in the distribution of velocity fluctuation scales more uniformly across the fluctuating spectrum as stated earlier in the near surface region fig 13 c f and i b u w values are distinctly higher along the elliptical peak range in the u w plane literature suggests that for a particle to travel in an elliptical trajectory it must follow the parametric form x 0 ϕ cos t z 0 φ sin t where x 0 and z 0 are the displacements in the x and z directions respectively ϕ and φ are arbitrary constants and t is time thus the velocity components can be written as u x 0 ϕ sin t w z 0 φ sin t π 2 hence the orthogonal components of the velocity of the particle have a phase difference of π 2 between them based on this analogy it can be concluded that there is a phase difference of π 2 between most of the values of u and w the water particles undergo an elliptical orbital motion under the influence of a shallow water wave dean and dalrymple 1991 as a result both u and w instantaneous velocities before phase averaging at a point in the flow against superimposed waves have a visible sinusoidal nature with a phase lag of π 2 between them it may be noted here that the all parameters including b u w presented in the paper have been computed after removal of wave potential component from the raw instantaneous velocity signal the energy from the wave is transferred to the turbulent velocity fluctuations through non linear interactions as evident from fig 13 c f and i for all the three cases wca1 wca2 and wca3 the wave energy interacts primarily with the smaller scale fluctuations and transfers the energy simultaneously to the u and w fluctuation such that they are at a phase lag of π 2 generating the observed elliptical configuration of the peak b u w further it is evident from fig 13 that the effect of the frequency of the superimposed wave is significant it can be clearly observed by comparing fig 13 b with fig 13 e and h that the valley in the central region of the b u w plot becomes wider as the frequency of the superimposed wave increases hence it can be inferred that the high frequency wave e g wca3 with f 1 2 hz has a greater effect on the b u w as compared to the low frequency wave e g wca1 with f 1 0 hz even in the near bed region it is interesting to observe that the higher frequency wave is more efficient in modulating the scale of fluctuations even at regions closer to the bed in comparison to the lower frequency waves for wave acting against the current this observation is in contrast to the linear wave theory wherein it is suggested that for the higher frequency with shorter wavelength the orbital motion of the fluid particles do not reach the bottom with significant strength goda 2010 a similar observation was also recorded recently for waves acting along current wherein it was reported that even in deep water wave cases turbulent fluctuations were modulated close to the bed roy et al 2017 however the effect reduced with the increase in frequency barman et al 2016 2017 and singh et al 2016 based on the above discussion it is observed that the higher frequency wave against current exhibits two distinct opposite characteristics firstly it seems to have a greater effect on b u w near the bed as compared to the low frequency wave secondly it behaves like a deep water wave which has a shallower penetration into the flow the only conclusion that can be drawn from the above discussion is that the presence of a larger wave energy does not solely produce the changes that are observed in b u w fig 13 a i had it been the case the lower frequency waves wca1 with a higher wave energy near the bed would have more strongly affected b u w compared to that of the higher frequency waves wca3 whereas this present result portrays an entirely different phenomenon please see fig 13 a and g wca1 and wca3 hence it may be stated that the frequency of the superimposed waves is the deciding factor in addition to the wave energy in modulating the fluctuating eddies thus due to the superimposition of the waves on the current the b u w corresponding to the large values u increases significantly and at the same time b u w of the small values of u decreases fig 13 a d and g therefore the waves tend to modulate the small scale disturbances strongly in the stream wise direction this confirms the decrease in pdf of the small scales of u and w is significant in the presence of waves fig 8 j k and l compared to that of the current alone case fig 8 i 3 6 distribution of turbulent eddies it is gestated from the above results and discussions that the superimposed surface wave acting against current considerably modulates the eddy structure inside the flow field kassem et al 2015 noted that the fourier analysis may be used for studying turbulent flows and understand the integral scales of motion in the frequency domain however the fourier analysis is incapable of resolving the inherent futures of statistically intermittent eddy structures of multiple scales that vary in space and time berry and greenwood 1975 whereas the wavelet analysis is capable of resolving a time series into time frequency space and thus may be used for the characterisation of the localised intermittent oscillations of turbulent structures farge 1992 grinsted et al 2004 de stefano and vasilyev 2012 and kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 reported that the wavelet analysis may be effectively used for performing multi scale decomposition and classifying and separating localised structures for example vortices in physical and wave number spaces farge et al 2001 2003 khujadze et al 2011 further wavelet analysis is performed for studying localised deviations of power within a time series daubechies 1990 grinsted et al 2004 torrence and compo 1998 in order to highlight the distinctiveness of eddy scale distributions based on the velocity fluctuations wavelet analysis is presented herein wang et al 2016 stated that the wavelet analysis of random signals is capable of giving information on the eddy scale and their associated occurrence frequency further for large reynolds number flows the length scale of eddies illustrate a broad range of the spectral band roy et al 2017 the current experiments were carried out with significant flow reynolds numbers re 3 55 104 wavelet analysis shows the velocity signal in the wavelet scale or pseudo frequency f p which is extracted by disintegrating the signal into flexibly sized time casement in wavelet analysis the scale to frequency is associated to determine the central frequency of the wavelet f ct based on the following relationship f p f c t d δ where d is a scale δ is the sampling period f ct is the center frequency of a wavelet in hz f is the pseudo frequency corresponding to the scale d in hz the concept is to relate a purely periodic signal of frequency f ct with a given wavelet short time fourier transform can acquire the time information but the range of the time window is constant for this purpose continuous wavelet transforms cwt of a signal s t i may be characterized by a family of wavelet functions e g roy et al 2017 that can be written as 20 ϖ l d 1 d s t i ψ t r d d t where ϖ is the wavelet coefficient l is the position time or space d is the wavelet scale the symbol represents the conjugated value ψ is the mother wavelet function wang et al 2016 the wavelet function is capable of expanding and changing the scale d and hence investigates the location t which corresponds to a particular scale of d the first fourier transform fft of a convolution in the time domain equals the point wise multiplication in the frequency domain wang et al 2016 hence the wavelet coefficient ϖ physically suggests the degree of correspondence between signal s t i and the wavelet function it is the simplest tool to study the full signal at different scales and positions in time or space domain by altering the parameters d and l an eddy can be explained as a function of time and scale frequency through the wavelet coefficient roy et al 2017 li and nozaki 1995 further the location of the highest valued wavelet coefficient depicts the large scale eddy the morlet wavelet is applied herein to distinguish the eddy scales based on the magnitudes of the wavelet coefficients similar to roy et al 2017 torrence and compo 1998 stated that errors would arise at the commencement and culmination of the wavelet power spectrum for a finite length time series generally known as the coi cone of influence they provided one solution to eliminate these cone effect that is to pad the end of the time series with zeroes before performing the wavelet transform and then remove them afterwards also the time series data was padded with adequate zeroes to carry the total signal length up to the next higher power of two this technique is very helpful to speed up the transform and bound edge effects kassem et al 2015 however torrence and compo 1998 noted that there is no need to pad with zeroes for cyclic series evolving no coi please note that as the present experiment deals with cyclic data series and focused on the temporal evolution of the particular peak frequencies and thus coi was not present earlier discussions suggest that the modulating capacity of the velocity fluctuation scales is maximum for the maximum frequency wave studied herein the wca3 case thus in this section we focus our discussion on the changes induced in the eddy structure for the wave acting against the current for the wca3 case in comparison to the current alone case at three different z h 0 51 fig 14 0 12 fig 15 0 01 fig 16 fig 14 b represents the contour plot of wavelet coefficients for only current flow ca in the upper region of the flow z h 0 51 and fig 14 e represents the same for wca3 f 1 2 hz fig 14 a and d represent the instantaneous velocity profiles at a particular point in both the cases it may be noted that the instantaneous velocity profile is shown in fig 14 d has not been phase averaged and is provided only for the purpose of illustration of the raw signal on the contrary the wavelet analysis is done by using the phase averaged velocity data by removing the wave potential term at a particular point fig 14 c and f represent the fft output of the phase averaged velocity fluctuations for comparison with pseudo frequency at which the different scales of eddies exist it is evident from fig 14 b and c that the energy containing eddies for the only current flow ca is having a pseudo frequency f p in the range of 0 1 hz however with the superimposition of the wave all the energy containing large scale eddies are modified and are now contained in a narrow range of the pseudo frequency i e f p 0 8 1 3 hz the peak value of the corresponding fft output is observed at f 1 2 hz i e at the frequency of the superimposed wave fig 14 e and f even though the wavelet coefficient computation has been carried out on the raw velocity signal after removal of the wave component thus it can be concluded that the superimposed wave of frequency f 1 2 hz is modulating the entire range of velocity fluctuations thus the whole spectrum of eddy scales associated in the current alone case as a result it is seen that the large scale eddies with large values of wavelet coefficients are concentrated at a pseudo frequency f p 1 2 hz which is similar to that of the frequency of the superimposed wave fig 15 shows the same plots as those presented in fig 14 but at z h 0 12 it can be observed in fig 15 b that the large scale energy containing eddies are confined to a pseudo frequency range f p 0 0 6 hz and are randomly distributed in the time domain it can be observed from fig 15 e that the superimposed wave is weakly modulating the eddies with f p 1 2 hz represented by a smaller wavelet coefficient at that particular frequency in comparison to the corresponding case for z h 0 51 further comparison of fig 15 b and 15 e reveals that the superimposed wave modulated the energy levels of the fluctuations of all scales eddy scales fig 16 represents the same plots as those present in figs 14 and 15 but at the region very close to the bed z h 0 01 it can be observed in fig 16 b that the large scale energy containing eddies are confined to a pseudo frequency range f p 0 0 6 hz and are randomly distributed in the time domain for the only current case comparison of fig 16 e for wca3 with that of fig 16 b for ca suggests that the superimposed wave is faintly modulating the eddies represented at f p 1 2 hz that are represented by a smaller wavelet coefficient however it may be noted that even at a region close to the bed the energy distribution structure across different frequencies is largely affected by wave acting against the current 4 conclusions the wave against the current is related to the tidal wave current combined flow few experiments and numerical investigations have been carried out in the past to explore the interaction of the waves propagating in the opposite direction to that of the current in the context of understanding the interaction turbulence structure also the higher order moments of the velocity fluctuations remained unexplored understanding the cross correlation of the fluctuations of two individual velocity components has a great importance in understanding the effects of the wave acting against the current on the various scales of eddies associated with the flow recently kassem et al 2015 performed an experiment with the aim to understand the spatial time and scale frequency interactions among wave generated boundary layer and event driven sediment transport under uneven shoaling and breaking waves in the nearshore of a prototype sandy barrier beach they found that the turbulent clusters in the uw plane have the highest power that distributed across the lower frequency range for the transverse standing wave however the propagation of the surface waves and the direction of the mean current flow was faintly discussed in kassem et al 2015 thus this paper is focussed on understanding the underlying mechanism behind the interaction between the waves and the turbulent eddies the primary conclusions from the present study are given as for a flow with wave against the current the mean velocity near the surface increases compared to the mean velocity of the only current flow this tendency of increasing the mean velocity of flow penetrates deeper into the flow for a higher frequency wave it is evident that the vertical velocity distributions of the present experimental data follow the similar trend as that of the existing model of yuan and madsen 2015 the reynolds stress reaches a maximum near the bed and gradually reduces towards the water surface the vertical turbulent intensity near the bed reduces due to the superimposition of the wave the higher frequency waves convert the smaller eddies into larger ones more strongly compared to the lower frequency waves this effect is more pronounced for fluctuations of velocity in the vertical direction as compared to the stream wise direction the maximum value of the probability density of the vertical velocity fluctuations decreases with the increase in the vertical distance from the bed this maximum value decays logarithmically as a function of superimposed wave frequency it can also be inferred that the scale of eddies increases near the surface due to the superimposed surface waves further the smaller fluctuations are more prone to modulation by the higher frequency waves the high frequency wave has a greater effect on the joint probability density function of the streamwise and vertical velocity fluctuations as compared to the low frequency wave even in the near bed region the frequency of the superimposed waves is the deciding factor in addition to the wave energy in modulating the fluctuating eddies finally it can be stated that the high frequency waves are better at partially inhibiting the small scale fluctuations and enhancing the medium scale fluctuations in the stream wise direction in order words the interaction between the waves and the small scale fluctuations becomes stronger as the frequency of the superimposed waves increases the modulation process becomes stronger across all frequencies as the elevation from the bed increases the superimposed wave modulates the large scale energy containing eddies which have a pseudo frequency similar to that of the frequency of the superimposed wave acknowledgements the author would like to

lmus c mating immediately following the pre mating operation the load of topside will be transferred from the dtv to the jacket by continuous ballasting preferably on falling tide this is the most critical phase for floatover installation as shown in fig 3 the following points should be paid special attention to the horizontal movements of the lmus should be normally restricted within a circle

based on a recently accomplished dynamic positioning floatover installation project in malaysian waters four subsystems respectively for the purposes of environment monitoring motion and position monitoring dsu separating monitoring and closed circuit television cctv monitoring are presented also the integrated monitoring system ims is proposed in section 2 the application of the monitoring system with respect to the recently implemented project in malaysian waters is described in section 3 the execution plan is described in details and the implementation process for the monitoring system including validation installation tests field mapping and calibration is presented the field monitoring results are also processed and briefly analyzed in section 4 some summary and concluding remarks are noted 2 monitoring system design field monitoring is essential to support floatover installation meteorological and oceanographic conditions are the most important factors in determining the technical feasibility of the floatover installation in the designated water gatto 1988 it is quite common to require a 24 48 h critical weather windows for floatover installation oneill et al 2000 therefore the ocean environmental conditions including tide wave wind as well as surface current should be monitored besides the lmu clearances between topside and jacket as well as the relative distance of dtv and jacket are of great interest for operators and the critical operational phases should be monitored visually to ensure the operation safety in addition during undocking operation the separating distances between dtv and topside also deserves attention most importantly as a reliable and effective field monitoring system it should offer the desired performances of data connectivity and transmission measuring accuracy and autonomy taking into account the above requirements for the operations of floatover installation the field monitoring system is designed with four parts including environment monitoring system topside motion and position monitoring system dsu separating monitoring system and cctv monitoring system additionally considering the requirements of data integration and central control for the entire monitoring system the ims is also proposed 2 1 environment monitoring system it is quite common to take advantage of the tidal cycle for the dtv lowering stage and waves especially swells give rise to the significant rolling responses of the dtv for the reason that the common rolling natural period of dtv with topside is so close to the periods of swells which causes a limiting wave height and period moreover environmental load of wind and current should also be taken into account depending on the site condition and installation window requirement typical limiting sea states for floatover installation are given as table 1 wang et al 2010 the environment monitoring system was developed to monitor the real time information of tide level wave height and period wind speed and direction as well as surface current speed tide monitoring is achieved by averaging pressure data acquired from a tide gauge which is placed inside a pump casing on the jacket the pump casing can be used for wave filtering the measuring principle of tide level is shown in fig 4 the water level h can be obtained via eq 1 as given below 1 p p 0 ρ g h where p is the pressure measured by tide gauge p 0 represents barometric pressure ρ is the sea water density g is the gravitational acceleration the tide level is the difference between water level and amphidromic point wave measurement can be accomplished by different apparatuses luo et al 2015 adopted the wave buoy system to measuring wave elevations and directions however it is difficult to deploy and recover the buoy system in this paper wave is measured by two different monitoring instruments fig 5 x band wave radar operated in short pulse mode measures the sea state from digitized sea clutter images which can work at all ship speed from a fixed location apart from wave height direction and period the complete three dimensional spectra are also available the measuring range of x band wave radar is between 0 5 m and 20 m wang et al 2017 however the floatover installations are always performed under sea condition with wave height less than 0 5 m therefore vertical measuring range finder vmrf installed on a stationary platform in the operating water is designed to obtain small amplitude wave measurement which emits a microwave signal and receives the echo from the water surface then the micro amplitudes and periods of water surface waves can be calculated by the signal propagation delay by means of advanced signal processing wind speed and direction can be monitored by different types of apparatuses like hot wire anemometer based on the measured current and resistance as well as acoustic anemometer based on the frequency of the induced vortex while taking the reliability and stability into consideration a 3 cup anemometer and a vane mounted on a small cross arm are applied fig 6 rotation of the cup wheel produces an alternating current ac sine wave voltage proportional to wind speed vane position is transmitted by a 10 kω potentiometer with the output voltage proportional to wind direction wind gauge should be placed at the highest position of the dtv to void the shelter effects of other structures current profile observation around platforms is feasible through the installation of acoustic doppler current profilers adcps govea et al 2006 as shown in fig 7 the current speed and direction in different layers of water column from sea surface to the seabed can be obtained without disturbance of the flow field the measured data can be transmitted to the service center by wireless method and simultaneously recorded in the memory inside the adcp as the dtv is a free floating body and drifts with the current thus the current speed and direction could be estimated by the dp system of dtv so the current measurement sometimes is not required for the dp floatover installation software of environment monitoring system is developed for data collection and centralized control the measured data of tide level wave height and period wind speed and direction as well as surface current can be processed and displayed instantaneously with the real time statistical results meanwhile the time series results can be custom plotted main interface of the software is shown in fig 8 the function division is marked in the picture here ➀tide level ➁statistical values of waves in full frequency domain ➂statistical values of waves in low frequency domain and high frequency domain ➃statistical values of wind speeds and directions ➄current speed and direction ➅image display of wind direction related to true north and the dtv heading ➆time series plot of tide level ➇time series plot of wave wind current and wave power spectrum the software can achieve the functions as following parameter settings of data acquisition communication channel selection acquisition frequency etc real time data display time series display pre processing of data wild points removing data filtering data statistics automatic data storage historical data reading daily hourly report generation automatically or manually automatic screenshots saving 2 2 motions and position monitoring system 6dof motions monitoring of the dtv is required for the lmus clearance calculation in vertical and transverse directions besides the position of dtv relative to the jacket and surrounding and underwater structures are of importance for dp operators dpos the position of topside can be measured with centimeter accuracy by a differential global positioning system dgps tang et al 2013 the gps reference station is installed on the nearest fixed platform and dual gps based mobile station is installed longitudinally on the dtv the angle of the dtv relative to geographic north can be calculated based on the dual gps mobile station moreover the position of topside can also be measured by a real time kinematic rtk system with the base station onshore wang 2015 additionally inertial navigation systems inss composed with gyroscopes and accelerometers can be used to monitor linear displacement and the inclination of dtv with high reliability due to being free from outside interferences however the drift error of the gyroscope and the zero deviation of the accelerometer are the most direct and important factors affecting the accuracy of the ins the error of data collected from the ins may be accumulated so it usually works in conjunction with dgps to ensure precision qu et al 2013 based on what is mentioned above the motions and position monitoring systems are designed as shown in fig 9 the primary system dgps laser ins system is designed with reference station installed on the nearest fixed platform and mobile station installed on the dtv the dtv position relative to jacket and surrounding structures is measured by the dgps system the heading of the dtv relative to the geographic north can be calculated accurately based on the long baseline dual gps based mobile station the secondary system dgps fiber optic ins system sharing the same reference station with the primary system is designed to guarantee redundancy besides a starfire dgps system as the backup system is developed to measure the position of topside when the reference station fails the topside motions and position monitoring software package is designed to provide motions and navigation information for floatover operations which consists of motions monitoring system and 2d navigation system the interfaces of motions monitoring system is shown in fig 10a the layout for lmu clearance monitoring items is shown in fig 10b the following functionalities were considered when the motions monitoring system was designed the significant value sign velocity vel and acceleration acc of 6dof surge sway heave roll pitch yaw motions of dtv can be calculated and displayed in real time the vertical and transverse distances of the top of jacket lmus and the bottom of topside matching lmus like a 1 and a 1 could be calculated based on the 6dof motions of dtv shown as dy and dz in fig 10a the time series of 6dof motions of dtv can be shown on the screen 2d navigation system was developed to assist dpos vividly during the floatover installation in particular it includes the following functions as shown in fig 11 guiding circular grids shown with customized mode center line of the jacket approach lines paralleling to the center lines track of the customized points on dtv tracking distances of selected points the coordinates of jacket dtv and mouse the heading of jacket and dtv 2 3 dsu separating monitoring system upon immediately transfer of the topside weight onto jacket the dtv will continue ballasting until allowable clearances between the bottom of topside and the top of dtv dsus have been achieved then the dtv can withdraw through the jackets therefore the dsus separating distances are monitored with the dsu separating monitoring system the principle of which is shown in fig 12 four laser type distance sensors are installed vertically on the main deck of dtv marked as m n p and q respectively while a b c d represents the positions of dsu respectively distances shown as l m δ l m from the sensors to the lower platform surface are measured with which the lower surface of topside will be determined then the distances shown as δ l c can be calculated based on the relative positions of dsu and laser sensors which is the focus of our attention the software interface of dsu separating monitoring system is shown in fig 13 δ l c would be calculated in real time and shown on the screen in red or in green depending on whether it is less or greater than the critical clearance for the safe undocking it is worth noting that if any one of the four laser sensors fails the system can still function properly based on the remaining three sensors 2 4 cctv monitoring system with the assistance of cctv monitoring system the critical operational phases could be monitored visually and the dpos could have a direct and correct view of the status of the vessel and surrounding conditions moreover the cctv system makes it possible to monitor the status of the different locations around the dtv the real time status of those high risk locations could be monitored by the cctv system instead of human the camera adopted allows to be rotated 360 without loss of focus high resolution ensured the clear image and the infra red lights on the camera make it possible to monitor even at 0 illuminance 0 lux the wireless techniques are applied to transmit monitored signal to the service center the interface of cctv monitoring system is shown in fig 14 nine monitor cameras could be displayed simultaneously on one screen each one could be enlarged or displayed full screen when needed the orientation and focal distance of those cameras can be controlled remotely from the service center 2 5 ims field monitoring system for installation is a complex system with a lot of sensors large amount of measurement information and scattered measuring points which contribute to the difficulty of management an efficient ims has the capability for simple data acquisition and excellent data connectivity the purpose of the ims is to make the management of the monitoring system more intelligent and systematic and the measurement information more synchronized and integrated the topological graph of the ims is shown in fig 15 the ims is based on a container fixed on the dtv deck as the service center fig 16 multichannel monitoring data is collected with a variety of remote signal transmission technologies and data sharing technology integrated monitored information could be transported from service center to bridge for operators with wireless method it is worth mentioning that for the convenience and intuitivism of operation the 2d navigation system interface and cctv monitoring interface are displayed along with the dp control panels as shown in fig 17 3 monitoring system application in this section we present a case of floatover monitoring application completed by shanghai jiao tong university sjtu in malaysian waters in 2017 the field monitoring package composed of environment monitoring system topside motions and position monitoring system dsu separating monitoring system cctv monitoring system as well as ims as presented in section 2 was adopted the overall layout of the system is shown in fig 18 it is noteworthy that centimeter level positioning technology for large scale multiple offshore structures was demonstrated for the first time in this project accurate field mapping of jacket and topside as well as calibration of system accuracy were conducted additionally networking technologies for complicated ocean environment monitoring apparatus and intelligent real time data processing and analysis technologies were also developed the established goals of reliability of the devices accuracy of the data and liberation of the labor were successfully achieved 3 1 execution plan considering the tight project schedule all the work related to preparation installation tests with respect to field monitoring system had to be done according to the plan to ensure the floatover installation is on schedule the execution plan is summarized as table 2 3 2 system validation and pre installation surveys throughout the design and later the improvement phase the testing and calibration of entire system has been unceasingly conducted in the campus of sjtu in particular the motions and position monitoring system testing was conducted as shown in fig 19 the dtv was simulated with a refitted tricycle which was equipped with motions and position monitoring system the lmus of topside and jacket were also placed at the measured position then the docking operation was simulated over and over through continuous improvement and testing this system was able to achieve all the function in the requirements reliability and stability of the system had also been improved pre installation surveys to be done in shipyard cover the two gps based heading calibration of the dtv xiang rui kou xrk which was conducted to ensure the dual gps based heading agrees well with the dtv heading fig 20 shows the sketch of heading calibration on xrk the coordinates of eight points along the portside starboard and stern of vessel have been measured using total station in this way vessel coordinate system is established the vessel heading could be determined by 6 points p1 p3 s1 s3 along the two sides of vessel the stern points st1 st2 were used to decide the origin of the coordinate system the site survey on the field waters covers the offset measurement with total station to determine the relative position between gps antenna of the reference station and jacket center fig 21 a shows the sketch of offset measurement with the total station placed on the helicopter platform the jacket coordinate system was established as illustrated in fig 21 b the origin o j is located on the jacket center the x j y j plane coincides with the mating plate of the jacket lmus with x j axis opposite to the docking direction z j axis positive pointing upward y j axis obeying the right hand rule based on the dgps system as well as accurate survey and mapping data motions and position of the dtv and topside were calculated and presented in the jacket coordinate system 3 3 monitoring results tide monitoring was started four days prior floatover installation as shown in fig 22 the monitored tide cycles were in a good agreement with the weather forecast except that the monitored mean tidal level is about 0 1 m lower than that of the weather forecast this means that the actual clearance between the topside lmus and the jacket lmus is 0 1 m lower than the designed values therefore the draft of the dtv was adjusted before docking to compensate this discrepancy by the way the tide range was less than 1 meter which could be regarded as small tide regarding that the dtv has a very good ballasting capability this floatover installation could be regarded as a tide free operation that means it does not need to catch up the tide phases in this project wave height was monitored with the vmrf since one day before the floatover installation and the significant wave height hs was also calculated in real time based on the most recent 20 min wave data as indicated in fig 23 which shows that the maximum significant wave height is lower than 0 3 m throughout the monitoring period the weather condition was very good and the wave height was sufficiently lower than the limiting sea states listed in table 1 therefore the floatover installation was able to be conducted as soon as possible wind speed in different directions was monitored since one day before floatover installation and the wind rose diagram is plotted to describe the probability distribution of wind speed in all directions as shown in fig 24 different colors represent different wind speeds and the longer the radius extends the greater the probability density is the wind direction is presented relative to the dtv heading in fig 24 a and the geographic north in fig 24 b respectively the obtained wind rose diagram indicate that the wind was mainly distributed in the south east of about 30 and mainly on the port side of the dtv with speed reaching up to 6 m s 7 m s during the floatover operation the motion and position monitoring system went smoothly and accurately fig 25 shows the real time motion responses of dtv during the standby docking mating and undocking phases the reference point of dtv is located on the stern midpoint the 2d navigation system precisely showed the position heading and moving track of topside and dtv besides the distances relative to surrounding structures were also provided as shown in fig 26 it is proved that the 2d navigation system provided efficient assistance with friendly and intelligent interface fig 27 presents the snapshots of monitoring window of the dsu separating monitoring system during matting operation the critical distance was set to 0 75 m when the separating clearance was greater than 0 75 m the color of the display bar became green then the undocking operation was allowed the dsu separating clearances of four different positions is shown in fig 28 the cctv monitoring system includes six video cameras with two cameras numbered as 1 2 installed on the stern of dtv to assist docking and undocking operations and the rest four cameras numbered from 3 to 6 installed next to the lmus on the topside to provide real time visual information during mating operation fig 29 shows the photos captured by the cctv monitoring system during floatover installation 4 summary and concluding remarks in this paper the design aspects of the field monitoring system for floatover installation are presented the monitoring system consists of environment monitoring system motions and position monitoring system dsu separating monitoring system and cctv monitoring system how each system works and what role it plays in floatover operations are introduced in details moreover integration of the entire monitoring system and how it assists the dpo operations are also described the applications of the field monitoring system with respect to a recently implemented floatover installation project in malaysian waters are presented the overall layout of the system on dtv and topside as well as the related execution plan are also illustrated moreover the implementation process for the monitoring system including validation installation tests calibration and operation are presented the monitoring results show that the field monitoring system went smoothly and accurately during floatover operations on one hand which proved the rationality of scheme and implementation most importantly the reliability and completeness of the system on the other hand the high quality data recorded by the field monitoring system is invaluable and can be referenced for the design and analysis for the future projects however some valuable experience lessons learnt should also be addressed more backup solutions should be prepared in advance to meet the very complicated and changing installation schedule on site the design of the monitoring system could be further optimized to improve the system reliability and stability additionally the execution schedule could also be further optimized to reduce the number of field engineers and to further reduce the risk and cost of offshore operations acknowledgment the authors from sjtu would like to thank captain mike king and the dpo

monitoring dsu separating monitoring and closed circuit television cctv monitoring are presented also the integrated monitoring system ims is proposed in section 2 the application of the monitoring system with respect to the recently implemented project in malaysian waters is described in section 3 the execution plan is described in details and the implementation process for the monitoring system including validation installation tests field mapping and calibration is presented the field monitoring results are also processed and briefly analyzed in section 4 some summary and concluding remarks are noted 2 monitoring system design field monitoring is essential to support floatover installation meteorological and oceanographic conditions are the most important factors in determining the technical feasibility of the floatover installation in the designated water gatto 1988 it is quite common to require a 24 48 h critical weather windows for floatover installation oneill et al 2000 therefore the ocean environmental conditions including tide wave wind as well as surface current should be monitored besides the lmu clearances between topside and jacket as well as the relative distance of dtv and jacket are of great interest for operators and the critical operational phases should be monitored visually to ensure the operation safety in addition during undocking operation the separating distances between dtv and topside also deserves attention most importantly as a reliable and effective field monitoring system it should offer the desired performances of data connectivity and transmission measuring accuracy and autonomy taking into account the above requirements for the operations of floatover installation the field monitoring system is designed with four parts including environment monitoring system topside motion and position monitoring system dsu separating monitoring system and cctv monitoring system additionally considering the requirements of data integration and central control for the entire monitoring system the ims is also proposed 2 1 environment monitoring system it is quite common to take advantage of the tidal cycle for the dtv lowering stage and waves especially swells give rise to the significant rolling responses of the dtv for the reason that the common rolling natural period of dtv with topside is so close to the periods of swells which causes a limiting wave height and period moreover environmental load of wind and current should also be taken into account depending on the site condition and installation window requirement typical limiting sea states for floatover installation are given as table 1 wang et al 2010 the environment monitoring system was developed to monitor the real time information of tide level wave height and period wind speed and direction as well as surface current speed tide monitoring is achieved by averaging pressure data acquired from a tide gauge which is placed inside a pump casing on the jacket the pump casing can be used for wave filtering the measuring principle of tide level is shown in fig 4 the water level h can be obtained via eq 1 as given below 1 p p 0 ρ g h where p is the pressure measured by tide gauge p 0 represents barometric pressure ρ is the sea water density g is the gravitational acceleration the tide level is the difference between water level and amphidromic point wave measurement can be accomplished by different apparatuses luo et al 2015 adopted the wave buoy system to measuring wave elevations and directions however it is difficult to deploy and recover the buoy system in this paper wave is measured by two different monitoring instruments fig 5 x band wave radar operated in short pulse mode measures the sea state from digitized sea clutter images which can work at all ship speed from a fixed location apart from wave height direction and period the complete three dimensional spectra are also available the measuring range of x band wave radar is between 0 5 m and 20 m wang et al 2017 however the floatover installations are always performed under sea condition with wave height less than 0 5 m therefore vertical measuring range finder vmrf installed on a stationary platform in the operating water is designed to obtain small amplitude wave measurement which emits a microwave signal and receives the echo from the water surface then the micro amplitudes and periods of water surface waves can be calculated by the signal propagation delay by means of advanced signal processing wind speed and direction can be monitored by different types of apparatuses like hot wire anemometer based on the measured current and resistance as well as acoustic anemometer based on the frequency of the induced vortex while taking the reliability and stability into consideration a 3 cup anemometer and a vane mounted on a small cross arm are applied fig 6 rotation of the cup wheel produces an alternating current ac sine wave voltage proportional to wind speed vane position is transmitted by a 10 kω potentiometer with the output voltage proportional to wind direction wind gauge should be placed at the highest position of the dtv to void the shelter effects of other structures current profile observation around platforms is feasible through the installation of acoustic doppler current profilers adcps govea et al 2006 as shown in fig 7 the current speed and direction in different layers of water column from sea surface to the seabed can be obtained without disturbance of the flow field the measured data can be transmitted to the service center by wireless method and simultaneously recorded in the memory inside the adcp as the dtv is a free floating body and drifts with the current thus the current speed and direction could be estimated by the dp system of dtv so the current measurement sometimes is not required for the dp floatover installation software of environment monitoring system is developed for data collection and centralized control the measured data of tide level wave height and period wind speed and direction as well as surface current can be processed and displayed instantaneously with the real time statistical results meanwhile the time series results can be custom plotted main interface of the software is shown in fig 8 the function division is marked in the picture here ➀tide level ➁statistical values of waves in full frequency domain ➂statistical values of waves in low frequency domain and high frequency domain ➃statistical values of wind speeds and directions ➄current speed and direction ➅image display of wind direction related to true north and the dtv heading ➆time series plot of tide level ➇time series plot of wave wind current and wave power spectrum the software can achieve the functions as following parameter settings of data acquisition communication channel selection acquisition frequency etc real time data display time series display pre processing of data wild points removing data filtering data statistics automatic data storage historical data reading daily hourly report generation automatically or manually automatic screenshots saving 2 2 motions and position monitoring system 6dof motions monitoring of the dtv is required for the lmus clearance calculation in vertical and transverse directions besides the position of dtv relative to the jacket and surrounding and underwater structures are of importance for dp operators dpos the position of topside can be measured with centimeter accuracy by a differential global positioning system dgps tang et al 2013 the gps reference station is installed on the nearest fixed platform and dual gps based mobile station is installed longitudinally on the dtv the angle of the dtv relative to geographic north can be calculated based on the dual gps mobile station moreover the position of topside can also be measured by a real time kinematic rtk system with the base station onshore wang 2015 additionally inertial navigation systems inss composed with gyroscopes and accelerometers can be used to monitor linear displacement and the inclination of dtv with high reliability due to being free from outside interferences however the drift error of the gyroscope and the zero deviation of the accelerometer are the most direct and important factors affecting the accuracy of the ins the error of data collected from the ins may be accumulated so it usually works in conjunction with dgps to ensure precision qu et al 2013 based on what is mentioned above the motions and position monitoring systems are designed as shown in fig 9 the primary system dgps laser ins system is designed with reference station installed on the nearest fixed platform and mobile station installed on the dtv the dtv position relative to jacket and surrounding structures is measured by the dgps system the heading of the dtv relative to the geographic north can be calculated accurately based on the long baseline dual gps based mobile station the secondary system dgps fiber optic ins system sharing the same reference station with the primary system is designed to guarantee redundancy besides a starfire dgps system as the backup system is developed to measure the position of topside when the reference station fails the topside motions and position monitoring software package is designed to provide motions and navigation information for floatover operations which consists of motions monitoring system and 2d navigation system the interfaces of motions monitoring system is shown in fig 10a the layout for lmu clearance monitoring items is shown in fig 10b the following functionalities were considered when the motions monitoring system was designed the significant value sign velocity vel and acceleration acc of 6dof surge sway heave roll pitch yaw motions of dtv can be calculated and displayed in real time the vertical and transverse distances of the top of jacket lmus and the bottom of topside matching lmus like a 1 and a 1 could be calculated based on the 6dof motions of dtv shown as dy and dz in fig 10a the time series of 6dof motions of dtv can be shown on the screen 2d navigation system was developed to assist dpos vividly during the floatover installation in particular it includes the following functions as shown in fig 11 guiding circular grids shown with customized mode center line of the jacket approach lines paralleling to the center lines track of the customized points on dtv tracking distances of selected points the coordinates of jacket dtv and mouse the heading of jacket and dtv 2 3 dsu separating monitoring system upon immediately transfer of the topside weight onto jacket the dtv will continue ballasting until allowable clearances between the bottom of topside and the top of dtv dsus have been achieved then the dtv can withdraw through the jackets therefore the dsus separating distances are monitored with the dsu separating monitoring system the principle of which is shown in fig 12 four laser type distance sensors are installed vertically on the main deck of dtv marked as m n p and q respectively while a b c d represents the positions of dsu respectively distances shown as l m δ l m from the sensors to the lower platform surface are measured with which the lower surface of topside will be determined then the distances shown as δ l c can be calculated based on the relative positions of dsu and laser sensors which is the focus of our attention the software interface of dsu separating monitoring system is shown in fig 13 δ l c would be calculated in real time and shown on the screen in red or in green depending on whether it is less or greater than the critical clearance for the safe undocking it is worth noting that if any one of the four laser sensors fails the system can still function properly based on the remaining three sensors 2 4 cctv monitoring system with the assistance of cctv monitoring system the critical operational phases could be monitored visually and the dpos could have a direct and correct view of the status of the vessel and surrounding conditions moreover the cctv system makes it possible to monitor the status of the different locations around the dtv the real time status of those high risk locations could be monitored by the cctv system instead of human the camera adopted allows to be rotated 360 without loss of focus high resolution ensured the clear image and the infra red lights on the camera make it possible to monitor even at 0 illuminance 0 lux the wireless techniques are applied to transmit monitored signal to the service center the interface of cctv monitoring system is shown in fig 14 nine monitor cameras could be displayed simultaneously on one screen each one could be enlarged or displayed full screen when needed the orientation and focal distance of those cameras can be controlled remotely from the service center 2 5 ims field monitoring system for installation is a complex system with a lot of sensors large amount of measurement information and scattered measuring points which contribute to the difficulty of management an efficient ims has the capability for simple data acquisition and excellent data connectivity the purpose of the ims is to make the management of the monitoring system more intelligent and systematic and the measurement information more synchronized and integrated the topological graph of the ims is shown in fig 15 the ims is based on a container fixed on the dtv deck as the service center fig 16 multichannel monitoring data is collected with a variety of remote signal transmission technologies and data sharing technology integrated monitored information could be transported from service center to bridge for operators with wireless method it is worth mentioning that for the convenience and intuitivism of operation the 2d navigation system interface and cctv monitoring interface are displayed along with the dp control panels as shown in fig 17 3 monitoring system application in this section we present a case of floatover monitoring application completed by shanghai jiao tong university sjtu in malaysian waters in 2017 the field monitoring package composed of environment monitoring system topside motions and position monitoring system dsu separating monitoring system cctv monitoring system as well as ims as presented in section 2 was adopted the overall layout of the system is shown in fig 18 it is noteworthy that centimeter level positioning technology for large scale multiple offshore structures was demonstrated for the first time in this project accurate field mapping of jacket and topside as well as calibration of system accuracy were conducted additionally networking technologies for complicated ocean environment monitoring apparatus and intelligent real time data processing and analysis technologies were also developed the established goals of reliability of the devices accuracy of the data and liberation of the labor were successfully achieved 3 1 execution plan considering the tight project schedule all the work related to preparation installation tests with respect to field monitoring system had to be done according to the plan to ensure the floatover installation is on schedule the execution plan is summarized as table 2 3 2 system validation and pre installation surveys throughout the design and later the improvement phase the testing and calibration of entire system has been unceasingly conducted in the campus of sjtu in particular the motions and position monitoring system testing was conducted as shown in fig 19 the dtv was simulated with a refitted tricycle which was equipped with motions and position monitoring system the lmus of topside and jacket were also placed at the measured position then the docking operation was simulated over and over through continuous improvement and testing this system was able to achieve all the function in the requirements reliability and stability of the system had also been improved pre installation surveys to be done in shipyard cover the two gps based heading calibration of the dtv xiang rui kou xrk which was conducted to ensure the dual gps based heading agrees well with the dtv heading fig 20 shows the sketch of heading calibration on xrk the coordinates of eight points along the portside starboard and stern of vessel have been measured using total station in this way vessel coordinate system is established the vessel heading could be determined by 6 points p1 p3 s1 s3 along the two sides of vessel the stern points st1 st2 were used to decide the origin of the coordinate system the site survey on the field waters covers the offset measurement with total station to determine the relative position between gps antenna of the reference station and jacket center fig 21 a shows the sketch of offset measurement with the total station placed on the helicopter platform the jacket coordinate system was established as illustrated in fig 21 b the origin o j is located on the jacket center the x j y j plane coincides with the mating plate of the jacket lmus with x j axis opposite to the docking direction z j axis positive pointing upward y j axis obeying the right hand rule based on the dgps system as well as accurate survey and mapping data motions and position of the dtv and topside were calculated and presented in the jacket coordinate system 3 3 monitoring results tide monitoring was started four days prior floatover installation as shown in fig 22 the monitored tide cycles were in a good agreement with the weather forecast except that the monitored mean tidal level is about 0 1 m lower than that of the weather forecast this means that the actual clearance between the topside lmus and the jacket lmus is 0 1 m lower than the designed values therefore the draft of the dtv was adjusted before docking to compensate this discrepancy by the way the tide range was less than 1 meter which could be regarded as small tide regarding that the dtv has a very good ballasting capability this floatover installation could be regarded as a tide free operation that means it does not need to catch up the tide phases in this project wave height was monitored with the vmrf since one day before the floatover installation and the significant wave height hs was also calculated in real time based on the most recent 20 min wave data as indicated in fig 23 which shows that the maximum significant wave height is lower than 0 3 m throughout the monitoring period the weather condition was very good and the wave height was sufficiently lower than the limiting sea states listed in table 1 therefore the floatover installation was able to be conducted as soon as possible wind speed in different directions was monitored since one day before floatover installation and the wind rose diagram is plotted to describe the probability distribution of wind speed in all directions as shown in fig 24 different colors represent different wind speeds and the longer the radius extends the greater the probability density is the wind direction is presented relative to the dtv heading in fig 24 a and the geographic north in fig 24 b respectively the obtained wind rose diagram indicate that the wind was mainly distributed in the south east of about 30 and mainly on the port side of the dtv with speed reaching up to 6 m s 7 m s during the floatover operation the motion and position monitoring system went smoothly and accurately fig 25 shows the real time motion responses of dtv during the standby docking mating and undocking phases the reference point of dtv is located on the stern midpoint the 2d navigation system precisely showed the position heading and moving track of topside and dtv besides the distances relative to surrounding structures were also provided as shown in fig 26 it is proved that the 2d navigation system provided efficient assistance with friendly and intelligent interface fig 27 presents the snapshots of monitoring window of the dsu separating monitoring system during matting operation the critical distance was set to 0 75 m when the separating clearance was greater than 0 75 m the color of the display bar became green then the undocking operation was allowed the dsu separating clearances of four different positions is shown in fig 28 the cctv monitoring system includes six video cameras with two cameras numbered as 1 2 installed on the stern of dtv to assist docking and undocking operations and the rest four cameras numbered from 3 to 6 installed next to the lmus on the topside to provide real time visual information during mating operation fig 29 shows the photos captured by the cctv monitoring system during floatover installation 4 summary and concluding remarks in this paper the design aspects of the field monitoring system for floatover installation are presented the monitoring system consists of environment monitoring system motions and position monitoring system dsu separating monitoring system and cctv monitoring system how each system works and what role it plays in floatover operations are introduced in details moreover integration of the entire monitoring system and how it assists the dpo operations are also described the applications of the field monitoring system with respect to a recently implemented floatover installation project in malaysian waters are presented the overall layout of the system on dtv and topside as well as the related execution plan are also illustrated moreover the implementation process for the monitoring system including validation installation tests calibration and operation are presented the monitoring results show that the field monitoring system went smoothly and accurately during floatover operations on one hand which proved the rationality of scheme and implementation most importantly the reliability and completeness of the system on the other hand the high quality data recorded by the field monitoring system is invaluable and can be referenced for the design and analysis for the future projects however some valuable experience lessons learnt should also be addressed more backup solutions should be prepared in advance to meet the very complicated and changing installation schedule on site the design of the monitoring system could be further optimized to improve the system reliability and stability additionally the execution schedule could also be further optimized to reduce the number of field engineers and to further reduce the risk and cost of offshore operations acknowledgment the authors from sjtu would like to thank captain mike king and the dpo

23633,one of the most promising wave energy converter type is oscillating water column owc system fluctuation amounts and the motion behavior of the water column inside the chamber are very important parameters effecting the energy extraction therefore predicting these parameters with respect to varying wave characteristics and geometric design parameters is of great importance in this study physical experiments are conducted for a bottom fixed owc system with seven different sizes of opening heights under various regular wave series average fluctuations inside the chamber are measured it is found that there is a critical relative opening height ratio α that makes the fluctuations maximum regardless of wave parameters used exponential and linear relationships are found between average fluctuations and dimensionless parameters dimensionless wave frequency and captured wavelength defined respectively mathematical models are developed to predict water column fluctuations under varying relative opening heights and wave parameters the results of mathematical models indicated good aggrement with experimental data also chamber water surface profiles are observed and related to defined dimensionless wave parameters another factor named as excessive harmful energy is determined which also induces sloshing motion inside the chamber after the critical ratio value α is exceeded it is found that under all wave series the highest relative average column water surface fluctuations occur at relative opening height α is equal to 0 67 which is a unique value it can be concluded that mathematical models can be used to estimate water column fluctuations from relative opening height and wave parameter data in the chamber keywords oscillating water column wave energy rectangular chamber incident wave surface fluctuations surface motions 1 introduction it is a well known fact that replacing our current energy sources with renewable ones is very crucial for our future https 2016 while energy demand is increasing by growing population and developments in technology with the realization that conventional energy sources are still excessive and more accessible than others it is not an easy task www conserve energy futur 2017 but unlimited and untapped ocean wave energy that has relatively greater power intensity compared to solar and wind energy is one of the auxiliaries which may help humanity achieve their responsibility for future generations efforts have already been ended up more than 1000 wave energy extraction devices and techniques patented in the world mc cormick 1981 owc converter system is the most promising and studied one with its simplicity adoptability and its well acceptancy it consists of a partially submerged hollow chamber with an opening beneath the water level towards the sea that has air trapped above it and a narrow duct at the top or rear of the device interacting with only air wave forces acting on the inlet of the converter system causes the water column inside the chamber act on a reciprocating manner which in turn generates the pressure variations above it pressure differences inside and outside the converter system forces air to flow in and out with high velocities then the generated pneumatic power can be converted again to electric power by a bidirectional turbine attached to the device that turns in the same way independent of airflow direction a navy officer of japan yoshio masuda who is one of the first pioneers in the field used wave energy to power navigation buoys oscillating under random waves with a turbine attached this system is named as oscillating water column afterwards falcao and henriques 2016 lots of efforts have been conducted by studying them analytically numerically and experimentally since owcs are one of the promising and major type of wave energy convertors this accumulation of knowledge from the performed studies conveyed us to the stage of deploying full scale prototypes such as bottom fixed 400 kw pico plant on the island of pico azores portugal 500 kw limpet owc plant on the island of islay scotland uk oceanlinx owc port kembla australia a breakwater integrated owc at the port of mutriku in northern spain it is reported that in the limpet owc system more than sixty thousand kilowatts has been generated to the national energy grid heath 2012 first attempts of theoretical analysis for owc system were conducted by mccormic on wave energy conversion buoys mccormick 1974 1976 evans 1978 used a rigid body model and studied the hydrodynamics of a fixed owc system theoretically ignoring the spatial variation of the free surface in the chamber he assumed the free surface of the chamber as a rigid weightless piston and a small width relative to the incident wave length under these assumptions oscillating body theory was able to be used this analysis further developed by evans 1982 falnes and mclver falnes and mciver 1985 by allowing pressure increase at the free surface which enables the possibility of deformable surface non plane surface sarmento and falcao 1985 used linear wave theory to develop a two dimensional owc analytical model with both linear and non linear power take off pto systems optimal pneumatic damping required for the compression of air for high efficiency is also studied evans porter evans and porter 1995 considered a two dimensional simple model of an owc system and their theoretical studies to calculate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the system they developed an approach using galerking method they claimed that immersion depth of the front wall and chamber length are the main parameters affecting the hydrodynamic efficiency sarmento 1992 conducted wave experiments with regular waves which have low steepness and showed the importance of pressure distribution in the chamber for the optimal efficiency of owc system morris thomas et al 2007 studied the hydrodynamic efficiency of a shore based owc system experimentally under progressive plane waves suitable to linear wave theory they focused on studying the parameters front wall draught thickness and aperture design of the submerged front wall under various wave parameters which found that they are affecting the shape and bandwidth of the hydrodynamic efficiency curve this experimental study is also one of the mostly used one for validation of numerical results wang et al 2002 experimentally and numerically studied the hydrodynamic performance of a shoreline mounted owc system by using boundary element method after validating their model with the experiments conducted under regular wave conditions with different bottom slopes they investigated effects of bottom slope and water depth hydrodynamic efficiency of an owc system was investigated numerically by zhang et al 2012 using a two phase level set immersed boundary method under regular waves with turbine damping they compared their study with the two dimensional theory of evans porter evans and porter 1995 and morris thomas et al 2007 and they showed that hydrodynamic efficiency results agree with physical parameters more than inviscid linear theory they found that when the orifice dimension increases it causes a pressure drop in the chamber which in turn decreases the hydrodynamic efficiency kamath et al kamath et al 2015 investigated the hydrodynamics of an owc including the free surface elevation under incident wave series using two dimensional numerical wave tank they found that there is a strong relationship between incident wave amplitude and free surface motion and waves having larger wavelength and amplitude generate larger chamber pressure ning et al 2016 performed an experimental study to research the hydrodynamic efficiency of a fixed owc structure miscellaneous geometric parameters were tested under various wave parameters the ratio of the exit area to chamber area was found to be 0 66 for optimal efficiency an experimental study was performed by chang et al 2016 for investigation of owc systems geometrical design including back plate angle fence plate and open wide parameters to optimize the maximum amplification of wave energy they concluded that chamber geometry especially back plate angle optimization is very significant for the wave amplification factor of the owc system mahnamfar et al mahnamfar made an investigation for the optimization of an owc system by using both physical and numerical models they changed the geometric parameters of an owc structure with an angular front plate and tested at several circumstances experimental model results were compared with the numerical model results nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse parameter was used as performance evaluation criteria and the nse values found to be 0 97 hydrodynamic efficiency of the owc system is studied by boulai and larbi bouali and larbi 2013 in terms of chamber geometry dimensions and their effects further the geometry is optimized to maximize the efficiency despite the progress been made it is not a straightforward task to figure out a unique design and commercialize it globally because the wave climate is not same everywhere and wave body and wave air interactions are very complex to be solved mathematically wave parameters are maybe the most important factor for extracting wave energy in a most efficient way and at a great extent also the geometric parameters should be justified for the prevalent wave climate mahnamfar due to the complexity of the energy extraction processes it is obvious that a unique design for all wave climates even for a particular wave characteristic could have not been invented so far more investigations and studies including every design parameter with different wave characteristics must be in progress experimental studies are in the minority among analytical and numerical ones their expensive time consuming and labor force requiring nature makes them harder to conduct also they are needed for verification of analytical and numerical studies to the best of our knowledge there is not an experimental study concentrating solely on the water column fluctuations with respect to various opening heights and different wave parameters in detail also any simple and practical mathematical model does not exist to predict the water column fluctuations in the chamber from opening heights and wave parameters even though surface profiles are defined in terms of efficient energy extraction in the literature there is not a precise enough observation to clarify two distinct surface profile types which are piston and sloshing types with respect to wave parameters and opening heights furthermore the data of water column surface fluctuations are mostly measured from a single point inside the chamber for the former experimental studies he et al 2013 in this study three wave gages were located in the chamber to measure the average water column surface fluctuations this is important because chamber water column surface profile across the cross section is often not planar and measurements performed from a single location may not represent the whole surface fluctuations appropriately the objectives of this study are i to investigate the effect of various opening heights of owc system on the chamber water column surface fluctuations under various regular wave conditions by physical models ii to investigate the effect of various wave parameters on the surface fluctuations of the chamber for different opening heights iii to investigate chamber water column surface profile behaviors depending on various opening heights and wave parameters iv to develop mathematical models to predict water column fluctuations inside the chamber from opening height and wave parameter values v to evaluate physical experimental model results with mathematical model results 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental study the physical experiments were conducted in the hydraulics laboratory of istanbul technical university a 22 m long 1 m high and 1 m wide wave flume was used for the experiments to absorb the outgoing wave energy for avoiding reflection from the back wall of the wave flume a sloped 1 4 porous type beach was constructed at the end sides of the flume are made of glass to observe the wave propagation and wave related phenomenon as shown in fig 1 wave flume is equipped with a hydraulic servo piston type wave generator system resistive type wave probes gauges probe monitors and data acquisition instruments were used to measure wave parameters wave height and period the owc converter system in the flume the locations of the wave probes and the wave flume are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively the sampling rate of the data collection was 50 hz also to avoid the re reflection of the waves from the wave maker data collection time period was limited with 25 s in this study linear wave theory was used wave length as a function of depth and wave period based on linear wave theory can be defined as 1 l g t 2 2 π tanh 2 π l h where l is the wave length g is the gravitational acceleration t is the period of the incident wave and h is the water depth four different regular waves were generated and water depth h was kept constant at 0 60 m during the experiments the wave parameters used in this study are given in table 1 where the first column refers to the generated wave series number h is the wave height t is the wave period and l is the wavelength a rectangular bottom fixed owc system was selected for the experimental studies the opening height of the owc system towards the sea was adjustable for seven different opening heights 0 20 m 0 25 m 0 30 m 0 35 m 0 40 m 0 45 m and 0 50 m with a front wall thickness of 1 5 c m 0 55 m and 0 60 m values were also tried but due to the air leakage from chamber any consistent measurement could not be performed these different geometric parameters are shown in table 2 where x is the opening height and y is the immersion depth also α x h and β y h are defined as relative opening height and relative immersion depth respectively a power take off pto mechanism is represented by using a circular outlet with a 0 02 m radius r a 3d presentation and 2d plot for dimensions and shape of the owc system is shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively one side of the energy converter system was made transparent from plexiglass to observe the column water surface fluctuations inside the chamber constant geometric parameters are given in table 3 to measure the water column fluctuations inside the owc system three wave gauges were located on front wall wg1 center wg2 and rear wall wg3 in the chamber on the central axis in the direction of incident waves as shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively for calculating the water column surface fluctuations data obtained from wg1 wg2 and wg3 were averaged the sampling rate of the data collection was also 50 hz 3 results and discussion the water column surface fluctuations were measured under four different regular wave series for a constant water depth with various opening heights and surface profiles observed through the plexiglass side of the chamber with seven different opening heights and four different wave parameters 28 sets of experiments are conducted for constant water depth 60 cm every set of experiment was performed twice to avoid possible mistakes 3 1 effect of wave parameters it is well known that water column surface profile in the chamber is strongly related to the frequency of the incident progressive waves impinging on the converter through the opening morris thomas et al 2007 if the water column surface profile remains nearly horizontal under the excitation of the incident waves during oscillation the water column surface can be considered as a weightless rigid piston moving periodically but sometimes depending on the frequency of the incident waves the surface profile acts like an excited liquid in a closed container in a symmetric about the origin manner which can be defined as a sloshing motion profile for some cases water column action inside the chamber behaves as a combination of these two described profiles piston type and sloshing motion observations through the experiments indicated that when incoming wave frequency is less then a particular value piston type motion is generated in the chamber when a certain larger frequency value is exceeded sloshing motion is observed between these frequencies an interval exists with a narrow bandwidth which water column surface profile behavior comprises of both distinct motions these water column surface profiles generated in the chamber were same for all opening heights these profiles are shown in fig 7 transmitted wave height μ is defined as 2 μ d h where d is average water column surface fluctuation for one wave period and h is the incident wave height dimensionless wave frequency k h is described as 3 k h ω 2 g h k h tanh k h where k is the wave number which is equal to 2 π l ω is the angular frequency of the incident wave relative opening height α and relative immersion depth β are defined as 4 α x h 5 β y h where x is opening height of the chamber y is immersion depth and h is constant water depth the transmitted wave height μ versus k h graph is shown in fig 8 for different relative opening heights α corresponding k h values for different wave series are shown over the data points on the graph some of the exponential decay function fittings for a clear vision are included onto the graph for better interpretation of the data coefficient of correlation r2 values of all fittings are found to be in range between 0 991 and 0 997 it is realized at first glance that as the k h increases μ becomes smaller due to increasing contribution of sloshing behavior to the surface profile in the chamber it is observed that for the k h values 0 75 and 1 52 the behavior of the water column surface is approximately piston type motion when k h is 2 15 the profile behavior comprises of both type of motions where sloshing motion is dominant and for k h value 3 12 sloshing type of motion prevails therefore somewhere between 1 52 k h 2 15 but closer to the k h value 2 15 there should be a transition zone that the profile dominancy is transformed from one to another it is noteworthy that as k h gets smaller from transition zone towards the piston type generating values μ increases much more rapidly than other intervals since most of the contribution to the μ values comes from piston type motion in this interval a small increase in the k h causes a greater decrease for average μ values via increasing sloshing type of motion but as the piston type motion almost vanishes in the sloshing dominant and fully sloshing intervals and as the average μ values are already quite diminished in a fully and sloshing dominant surface profiles increasing k h values do not effect μ as much as in the opposite case these behaviors hold on for all relative opening heights except the effect of varying k h declines as α becomes smaller fig 8 shows that non linearity decreases as the immersion depth advances to bottom due to exponentially decay in energy as the gap between the bottom and the chamber closes down it leads to a relatively smaller change of transmission of wave energy as the k h varies consequently transmitted wave height is less sensitive to the effects of varying k h the most non linearity exponential growth is measured for α value 0 67 among others this value is important because bigger rate of change with respect to decreasing k h values is obtained this phenomenon and exponential decay in the energy will be further discussed later in the paper by using fig 8 for the particular design used in this experimental study for a given wave height h and period t or wave length l average chamber water column fluctuations in the chamber d can approximately be measured for any relative opening height except extreme cases using the exponentional fittings in case of a fully sloshing motion inside the chamber feasible amount of energy exploitation is almost impossible because the volume of the air in the chamber nearly stays constant thus trapped air above the water column can not be pressurized to further explain this phenomenon fig 9 shows the dimensionless time series t t time t divided by period of generated wave t for the transmitted wave heights at the front wall center and the rear wall of the chamber for the case 4 which α and β values are 0 58 and 0 42 respectively under the incident wave series number 4 this wave series has the highest frequency among the other ones which generates the smallest average fluctuations due to almost fully sloshing mode formed in the chamber at this point it is also noteworthy that for any other case the figure will look the same with a different sloshing amplitude transmitted wave heights measured with the wg3 which is located at the right hand side of the chamber has approximately 180 phase difference with the fluctuation value at the left hand side wg1 of the chamber and a very small fluctuation at the middle wg2 also it is seen from fig 9 that average water column surface fluctuation values are very small hence energy extraction could not be efficiently possible the opening height of the chamber did not effect this behavior of the surface profile but the difference is the increment for sloshing angle of the profile with increasing of the opening height this result is predictable because higher transmission of energy into the chamber takes place as the opening height increases under wave series w1 opposite case was observed the column water surface profile almost behaves without sloshing w1 has the smallest frequency among others fig 10 shows the transmitted wave height versus dimensionless time series for this situation as it is seen from fig 10 unlike the w4 measured values of transmitted wave heights for three positions are in phase they altogether contribute to the average transmitted wave height value in a building manner if we compare the averaged μ value with the central point it can be realized that they almost overlap each other so for this situation transmitted wave heights can be represented by the fluctuation value at the center of the surface as brendmo et al 1996 stated in their study it is reported that if the chamber width is very small compared to the exposed incident wave length water column surface profile behavior can be considered as piston type falnes and mciver 1985 captured wave length ratio δ is defined as 6 δ l l where l is the incident wave length and the l is the chamber length measured transmitted wave height values versus captured wave length ratios for different relative opening heights with the regression lines are depicted in fig 11 interestingly an impressive linear relationship exists between the two variables as it is seen from the fitted regression lines r2 values of all regression lines are approximately 1 μ values are highly dependent on captured wave length ratios these results are very essential for harnessing large amounts of energy the extreme cases fully sloshing and piston type motions occur for the interval δ 3 and δ 4 25 respectively somewhere between these captured wave length ratios there is a transition interval where water column surface behavior transforms from sloshing dominant to piston type dominant motion it is evident from the graph that when the water column is excited in a piston type manner the transmitted wave heights get bigger which is desired for higher efficiency therefore corresponding captured wave length intervals are of great importance as transmitted wave heights increase with bigger captured wave lengths when δ value moves from lower to higher values the piston behavior starts to dominate approximately around the δ value is 4 25 when δ value is around 3 75 surface profile transforms into sloshing dominant region and fully sloshing motion occurs at the approximate value of 3 to form a piston type motion behaviour in the chamber for higher efficiencies captured wave length ratios less than 4 should be strictly avoided furthermore fig 11 shows that this encountered phenomenon is valid for any relative opening height but the change is the increase in the variation of μ as the relative opening height gets bigger again the biggest slope was obtained when the α value was 0 67 which indicates the importance of this specific ratio 3 2 effects of varying opening height to understand the effects of varying opening heights on the water column surface fluctuations the wave parameters were kept constant the relative opening heights were altered under regular wave series given in table 1 at a constant water depth 0 60 m the results for the wave series that has the highest frequency are excluded since they are not of interest in terms of efficient energy extraction relative average water column surface fluctuation is defined as 7 η d h where d is average water column surface fluctuation and h is the water depth relative average water column surface fluctuation versus relative opening height is indicated in fig 12 with quadrating fittings for wave series w1 w2 and w3 as it is obviously seen from fig 12 largest η values were generated in the chamber when the ratio of the relative opening height is around 0 67 independent of wave parameters the relative average fluctuations increase from α values 0 33 to 0 67 while opposite trend is measured from 0 67 to 0 83 for all wave series after the peak ratio 0 67 relative average fluctuations decline more rapidly than they increased up to this value with the aid of observations what it is thought happening is for relative opening heights from 0 33 to 0 67 the profile behavior of the water column surface remains quite same whatever the profile was generated by the incident wave but after this ratio an additional sloshing motion is added to the behavior of the profile this sloshing motion decreases the fluctuations because of the averaging process of measurements at the locations of right center and left hand side of the chamber so there is a critical value around the ratio 0 67 that when exceeded the additional energy transmitted into the system is superimposed as a sloshing motion on to the surface profile the energy flux generated by incident waves are not distributed evenly below the surface it decreases exponentially towards the seabed so the higher contribution to the energy flux comes from the parts near the surface thus the additional transmitted part of the flux after the α value 0 67 is relatively higher this excessive flux forms greater reflection from the rear wall of the chamber as α value advances further beyond the critical value reflection grows in this manner when the higher transmitted rate of energy after the value 0 67 encounters the back wall of the owc structure a standing wave forms due to almost perfect reflection therefore the rate of energy transmission into the chamber is so high that additional conveyed energy into the chamber is transformed to kinetic energy in the form of vertical motion of the water particles near the rear wall due to reflection in turn stimulating the sloshing motion inside the chamber the vertical motion velocities of the water particles are very high at the right half especially at the back wall of the chamber since the remaining part of the water column can not keep pace with right half this excessive flux forms sloshing motion in the chamber that approximately generates 180 degrees of phase difference for the water column fluctuations and velocities between the front and rear wall then this symmetric about the origin type of motion is joined to the surface profile of the water column whatever it was after the α value 0 67 because we average them surface fluctuations start to decrease after the critical ratio is exceeded as it goes further beyond the value 0 67 the consequences are the same regardless of wave parameters in the previous section it is concluded that when captured wave length δ is less than an approximate value sloshing motion is generated in the chamber besides a relatively small captured wave length δ energy flux after the critical α value 0 67 also generates an additional sloshing motion inside the chamber so beyond this ratio additional energy transmitted into the chamber can be considered as an excessive harmful energy since it is not just turned into an unextractable form but it absorbs the already available energy up to this value this significant event should be taken into consideration seriously in designing owc systems furthermore this event is independent of wave parameters it becomes even more crucial if there are some fluctuations in the water level if such a phenomenon exists the relative opening height values should be chosen according to an appropriate range to harness the most energy in the owc plant service time 3 3 description of mathematical model for constant wave parameters in this experimental study to determine the effects of relative opening heights and immersion depths on the average water column fluctuations wave parameters were kept constant as the opening height and immersion depth were altered independent of the wave series used parameters of case 1 developed the smallest relative average water column surface fluctuation values that can be seen in fig 12 after inspection of the measured data a proportionality is found between relative average water column surface fluctuation η and a combination of power functions of α and β as follows 8 η β 1 1 α 2 this equation implies that η is proportional to the square of relative opening height α and relative immersion depth β raised to power 1 1 η versus β 1 1 α 2 plot with regression lines which have an average r2 0 96 value is shown in fig 13 for different wave series the only difference is the slope of the regression lines among the wave series w1 generates not only the highest average fluctuations in the chamber but also the biggest slope as β 1 1 α 2 value increases to further illustrate this proportionality the terms η i α i and β i will be introduced for i values 1 2 3 4 5 6 a n d 7 where subscript i indicates the case number therefore η i will represent the average water column surface fluctuation for corresponding values of α i and β i then these values will be normalized with respect to η 1 α 1 and β 1 as respectively 9 η i η 1 α i α 1 and β i β 1 it should be reminded that the η 1 is the smallest value generated in the chamber which represents the fluctuation value for case 1 as a result these ratios describe the variations of the corresponding values with respect to case 1 in order to eq 8 hold true also following expression should be correct for all i values and for all wave series 10 η i η 1 α i 2 α 1 2 β i 1 1 β 1 1 1 f α i β i the values of η i η 1 and f α i β i are depicted in fig 14 with varying dimensionless opening heights for all i values there exists a good fit between η i η 1 and f α i β i values that shows suggested proportionality in eq 8 is approximately accurate the reasoning for this proportionality could be explained in the following manner since the lowest point of the front wall was always under the still water surface during the experiments a partial reflection occurred depending on the immersion depth which in turn will form a partial standing wave having higher amplitude relative to the incident progressive wave as observed during our studies the amount of this amplification increases by the immersion depth increment while the reflection phenomenon from the front wall approaches to perfect reflection this leap in the wave height just in front of the chamber leads to an enhanced pressure distribution on the surface of inlet area because the pressure beneath the wave is proportional with wave height this pressure increment corresponds to a greater excitation force to the water column through the inlet section of the chamber resulting higher fluctuations it is also reasonable to expect a greater average fluctuation increasing exponentially inside the chamber as the relative opening height increases because as mentioned earlier the energy flux in a wave exponentially increases as it is ascended near the surface after the peak value of η i η 1 corresponding values of α and β assembles together in a manner such that η i η 1 values start to decrease from the plot we it can be also realized the peak point in fig 14 which corresponds to approximately α value 0 67 is very significant as we mentioned earlier because it is the value which generates the greatest fluctuation values and also when exceeded the relative average fluctuations start to decrease for further applicable cases in designing owc plants this critical value should be taken into consideration to the best of our knowledge since there is no reference to this critical phenomenon in the literature for different geometric design parameters this critical value notion and its approximate value has to be investigated it was stated that there existed a proportionality between η and β 1 1 α 2 with different proportionality ratios for each wave series as can be seen from fig 14 but when the normalized values of η and β 1 1 α 2 for all cases were plotted under different wave series in fig 15 interestingly it has been understood that variation of η values with respect to relative opening heights α do not depend on wave parameters normalized relative average fluctuation as a function of dimensionless opening height α can be represented by a quadratic regression curve quite accurately using the discrete data as plotted in fig 15 r2 of this regression curve is found to be 0 984 so this equation can be used to model the variations of relative water column surface fluctuations for any opening and immersion depth confidently one can predetermine the fluctuation variations regardless of wave parameters proportionality relationship which is eq 8 can be converted to an equation by introducing a proportionality constant c as follows 11 η c β 1 1 α 2 the value of the constant c can be calculated if any fluctuation d corresponding to a particular β and α values is known for a particular incident wave series eq 11 is valuable in terms of time money and labor consuming nature of the experimental studies before conducting further experiments fluctuation values can be computed for at least as a first approximation α and β values are related to each other with the equation 12 α β 1 hence eq 11 can be expressed as follows 13 η c 1 α 1 1 α 2 when η is differentiated with respect to α it leads to 14 d η d α c 2 α 1 α 1 1 1 1 α 2 1 α 0 1 to find the maximum value of η the eq 14 has to equalize to zero 15 d η d α c 2 α 1 α 1 1 1 1 α 2 1 α 0 1 0 the solution to eq 15 is possible if the expression in the parenthesis is equal to zero which becomes 16 2 α 1 α 1 1 1 1 α 2 1 α 0 1 0 α value obtained from the equation above is 0 65 which is very close to 0 67 the second derivative of η with respect to α yields the following equation 17 d 2 η d α 2 c 2 1 α 1 1 4 4 α 1 α 0 1 0 11 α 2 1 α 0 9 when α is equal to 0 65 the value of the d 2 η d α 2 is a negative number times c since c is always positive the conclusion is eq 11 reaches its maximum value when α 0 65 3 4 description of mathematical model for constant opening heights how relative average water column surface fluctuations depend on the wave parameters is also important for us because once the wave energy converter system is installed water column in the converter system will be excited by waves possessing different characteristics which can lead undesired efficiency problems therefore to predict the response of the system to diverse wave parameters is crucial because of this reason relative average fluctuation values were measured as incident wave series were altered while dimensionless opening heights held constant for all cases the experimental data indicate a proportional relationship as follows 18 η h l 2 this relationship for all relative opening heights with regression lines is plotted in fig 15 r2 values vary in range between 0 97 and 0 99 from the figure this linear relationship between η and h l 2 is obviously seen average water column surface fluctuation values have quadratic relationship with l and linear with h values that is predictable because it was observed previously that waves with higher wave lengths generate piston type motion that has higher transmission rates yield greater average fluctuations in the chamber wave height is of second priority since its effect is linear because the pressure distribution beneath the wave is proportional to wave height being proportional with h l 2 is valid for all opening heights with slightly different slopes as in the previous investigations the biggest slope is for α value 0 67 it is also evident that there is an admirable fit between the experimental data and experimental model finally two mathematical models eqs 8 and 18 can be combined to obtain a more general description of relative average water column fluctuations as follows 19 η β 1 1 α 2 h l 2 because there exists a good agreement between mathematical model results and experimental data proposed equations can be used in practical applications if any of the surface fluctuation value is known corresponding to any wave parameter proportionality constant can be determined then any variable can be changed to obtain corresponding relative average surface fluctuation value and actual fluctuation d in the chamber by using the water depth of course this is valid for fixed rectangular owc system with the design parameters used in this study but since fixed owc system are common and widely installed for testing purposes at different places with various wave climates falcao and henriques 2016 the results of this study will come in useful for further optimization studies 4 conclusions the optimization of the geometry and design of an owc system is very crucial under different wave climates water column surface fluctuations are the conveying processes for the transmission of wave power to pneumatic power so predicting its behavior under different sea conditions and different design parameters could give us an important knowledge to increase wave energy converter efficiency in this study effects of wave parameters and different opening height values on the chamber water surface profile and fluctuations of a bottom fixed rectangular owc system are investigated four different regular wave series and seven opening height values are experimentally studied under a constant water depth in a wave flume as frequency of incident wave gets smaller a greater portion of wave height transmitted wave height penetrates into the chamber this phenomenon is valid for all relative opening heights average chamber water column surface fluctuation d can be approximated accurately by the exponential fittings used in μ versus k h plot that follow the data closely for all relative opening heights a linear relationship is found between captured wave length ratio δ and transmitted wave height μ for relative opening height α a very crucial ratio is found which is around 0 67 relative opening height close to this value generates the highest average fluctuations in the chamber regardless of wave parameters furthermore if this ratio is exceeded average fluctuations start to decrease which should be taken into consideration in owc plant design using the experimental data relative average water column fluctuations are mathematically modeled in terms of relative opening height and wave parameters for all cases there exists a remarkable fit between mathmetical model and experimental data eq 19 may serve as a simple analytical tool to determine the average fluctuations in the chamber with respect to immersion depth and wave parameters in a practical way since optimization of front wall underwater geometry with different wave climates alter the fluctuations that generates the pressure oscillations within the trapped air derived mathematical model may be exploited by engineers and investigators for future studies sloshing motion of the surface profile should strictly be avoided in terms of energy harvesting waves with relatively high frequency generate sloshing motion in the chamber in addition to that from the observations of the study an additional cause for this phenomenon is found the energy defined as excessive harmful energy which is transmitted into the chamber after the critical relative opening ratio 0 67 forms additional sloshing motion for all the wave series the highest relative average column water surface fluctuations occur at relative opening height α is equal to 0 67 which is a unique value the amount of energy transmitted into the chamber after this ratio generates an additional sloshing motion to the water column which is called excessive harmful energy this phenomenon is another reason for sloshing motion regardless of wave parameters the critical α ratio 0 67 should be avoided in the geometric design the variation of average column water surface fluctuations computed as η η 1 with respect to varying relative opening heights α has been mathematically modeled by using only the variables relative opening height and relative immersion depth when the relative opening height is constant a similar mathematical model for approximating the same variations with respect to wave parameters is constructed physical experimental model results agree with mathematical model values remarkably after approximately computing the average chamber water column surface fluctuation d the variations for this value with respect to changing wave parameters and relative opening heights can further be calculated by the given mathematical models

23633,one of the most promising wave energy converter type is oscillating water column owc system fluctuation amounts and the motion behavior of the water column inside the chamber are very important parameters effecting the energy extraction therefore predicting these parameters with respect to varying wave characteristics and geometric design parameters is of great importance in this study physical experiments are conducted for a bottom fixed owc system with seven different sizes of opening heights under various regular wave series average fluctuations inside the chamber are measured it is found that there is a critical relative opening height ratio α that makes the fluctuations maximum regardless of wave parameters used exponential and linear relationships are found between average fluctuations and dimensionless parameters dimensionless wave frequency and captured wavelength defined respectively mathematical models are developed to predict water column fluctuations under varying relative opening heights and wave parameters the results of mathematical models indicated good aggrement with experimental data also chamber water surface profiles are observed and related to defined dimensionless wave parameters another factor named as excessive harmful energy is determined which also induces sloshing motion inside the chamber after the critical ratio value α is exceeded it is found that under all wave series the highest relative average column water surface fluctuations occur at relative opening height α is equal to 0 67 which is a unique value it can be concluded that mathematical models can be used to estimate water column fluctuations from relative opening height and wave parameter data in the chamber keywords oscillating water column wave energy rectangular chamber incident wave surface fluctuations surface motions 1 introduction it is a well known fact that replacing our current energy sources with renewable ones is very crucial for our future https 2016 while energy demand is increasing by growing population and developments in technology with the realization that conventional energy sources are still excessive and more accessible than others it is not an easy task www conserve energy futur 2017 but unlimited and untapped ocean wave energy that has relatively greater power intensity compared to solar and wind energy is one of the auxiliaries which may help humanity achieve their responsibility for future generations efforts have already been ended up more than 1000 wave energy extraction devices and techniques patented in the world mc cormick 1981 owc converter system is the most promising and studied one with its simplicity adoptability and its well acceptancy it consists of a partially submerged hollow chamber with an opening beneath the water level towards the sea that has air trapped above it and a narrow duct at the top or rear of the device interacting with only air wave forces acting on the inlet of the converter system causes the water column inside the chamber act on a reciprocating manner which in turn generates the pressure variations above it pressure differences inside and outside the converter system forces air to flow in and out with high velocities then the generated pneumatic power can be converted again to electric power by a bidirectional turbine attached to the device that turns in the same way independent of airflow direction a navy officer of japan yoshio masuda who is one of the first pioneers in the field used wave energy to power navigation buoys oscillating under random waves with a turbine attached this system is named as oscillating water column afterwards falcao and henriques 2016 lots of efforts have been conducted by studying them analytically numerically and experimentally since owcs are one of the promising and major type of wave energy convertors this accumulation of knowledge from the performed studies conveyed us to the stage of deploying full scale prototypes such as bottom fixed 400 kw pico plant on the island of pico azores portugal 500 kw limpet owc plant on the island of islay scotland uk oceanlinx owc port kembla australia a breakwater integrated owc at the port of mutriku in northern spain it is reported that in the limpet owc system more than sixty thousand kilowatts has been generated to the national energy grid heath 2012 first attempts of theoretical analysis for owc system were conducted by mccormic on wave energy conversion buoys mccormick 1974 1976 evans 1978 used a rigid body model and studied the hydrodynamics of a fixed owc system theoretically ignoring the spatial variation of the free surface in the chamber he assumed the free surface of the chamber as a rigid weightless piston and a small width relative to the incident wave length under these assumptions oscillating body theory was able to be used this analysis further developed by evans 1982 falnes and mclver falnes and mciver 1985 by allowing pressure increase at the free surface which enables the possibility of deformable surface non plane surface sarmento and falcao 1985 used linear wave theory to develop a two dimensional owc analytical model with both linear and non linear power take off pto systems optimal pneumatic damping required for the compression of air for high efficiency is also studied evans porter evans and porter 1995 considered a two dimensional simple model of an owc system and their theoretical studies to calculate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the system they developed an approach using galerking method they claimed that immersion depth of the front wall and chamber length are the main parameters affecting the hydrodynamic efficiency sarmento 1992 conducted wave experiments with regular waves which have low steepness and showed the importance of pressure distribution in the chamber for the optimal efficiency of owc system morris thomas et al 2007 studied the hydrodynamic efficiency of a shore based owc system experimentally under progressive plane waves suitable to linear wave theory they focused on studying the parameters front wall draught thickness and aperture design of the submerged front wall under various wave parameters which found that they are affecting the shape and bandwidth of the hydrodynamic efficiency curve this experimental study is also one of the mostly used one for validation of numerical results wang et al 2002 experimentally and numerically studied the hydrodynamic performance of a shoreline mounted owc system by using boundary element method after validating their model with the experiments conducted under regular wave conditions with different bottom slopes they investigated effects of bottom slope and water depth hydrodynamic efficiency of an owc system was investigated numerically by zhang et al 2012 using a two phase level set immersed boundary method under regular waves with turbine damping they compared their study with the two dimensional theory of evans porter evans and porter 1995 and morris thomas et al 2007 and they showed that hydrodynamic efficiency results agree with physical parameters more than inviscid linear theory they found that when the orifice dimension increases it causes a pressure drop in the chamber which in turn decreases the hydrodynamic efficiency kamath et al kamath et al 2015 investigated the hydrodynamics of an owc including the free surface elevation under incident wave series using two dimensional numerical wave tank they found that there is a strong relationship between incident wave amplitude and free surface motion and waves having larger wavelength and amplitude generate larger chamber pressure ning et al 2016 performed an experimental study to research the hydrodynamic efficiency of a fixed owc structure miscellaneous geometric parameters were tested under various wave parameters the ratio of the exit area to chamber area was found to be 0 66 for optimal efficiency an experimental study was performed by chang et al 2016 for investigation of owc systems geometrical design including back plate angle fence plate and open wide parameters to optimize the maximum amplification of wave energy they concluded that chamber geometry especially back plate angle optimization is very significant for the wave amplification factor of the owc system mahnamfar et al mahnamfar made an investigation for the optimization of an owc system by using both physical and numerical models they changed the geometric parameters of an owc structure with an angular front plate and tested at several circumstances experimental model results were compared with the numerical model results nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse parameter was used as performance evaluation criteria and the nse values found to be 0 97 hydrodynamic efficiency of the owc system is studied by boulai and larbi bouali and larbi 2013 in terms of chamber geometry dimensions and their effects further the geometry is optimized to maximize the efficiency despite the progress been made it is not a straightforward task to figure out a unique design and commercialize it globally because the wave climate is not same everywhere and wave body and wave air interactions are very complex to be solved mathematically wave parameters are maybe the most important factor for extracting wave energy in a most efficient way and at a great extent also the geometric parameters should be justified for the prevalent wave climate mahnamfar due to the complexity of the energy extraction processes it is obvious that a unique design for all wave climates even for a particular wave characteristic could have not been invented so far more investigations and studies including every design parameter with different wave characteristics must be in progress experimental studies are in the minority among analytical and numerical ones their expensive time consuming and labor force requiring nature makes them harder to conduct also they are needed for verification of analytical and numerical studies to the best of our knowledge there is not an experimental study concentrating solely on the water column fluctuations with respect to various opening heights and different wave parameters in detail also any simple and practical mathematical model does not exist to predict the water column fluctuations in the chamber from opening heights and wave parameters even though surface profiles are defined in terms of efficient energy extraction in the literature there is not a precise enough observation to clarify two distinct surface profile types which are piston and sloshing types with respect to wave parameters and opening heights furthermore the data of water column surface fluctuations are mostly measured from a single point inside the chamber for the former experimental studies he et al 2013 in this study three wave gages were located in the chamber to measure the average water column surface fluctuations this is important because chamber water column surface profile across the cross section is often not planar and measurements performed from a single location may not represent the whole surface fluctuations appropriately the objectives of this study are i to investigate the effect of various opening heights of owc system on the chamber water column surface fluctuations under various regular wave conditions by physical models ii to investigate the effect of various wave parameters on the surface fluctuations of the chamber for different opening heights iii to investigate chamber water column surface profile behaviors depending on various opening heights and wave parameters iv to develop mathematical models to predict water column fluctuations inside the chamber from opening height and wave parameter values v to evaluate physical experimental model results with mathematical model results 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental study the physical experiments were conducted in the hydraulics laboratory of istanbul technical university a 22 m long 1 m high and 1 m wide wave flume was used for the experiments to absorb the outgoing wave energy for avoiding reflection from the back wall of the wave flume a sloped 1 4 porous type beach was constructed at the end sides of the flume are made of glass to observe the wave propagation and wave related phenomenon as shown in fig 1 wave flume is equipped with a hydraulic servo piston type wave generator system resistive type wave probes gauges probe monitors and data acquisition instruments were used to measure wave parameters wave height and period the owc converter system in the flume the locations of the wave probes and the wave flume are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively the sampling rate of the data collection was 50 hz also to avoid the re reflection of the waves from the wave maker data collection time period was limited with 25 s in this study linear wave theory was used wave length as a function of depth and wave period based on linear wave theory can be defined as 1 l g t 2 2 π tanh 2 π l h where l is the wave length g is the gravitational acceleration t is the period of the incident wave and h is the water depth four different regular waves were generated and water depth h was kept constant at 0 60 m during the experiments the wave parameters used in this study are given in table 1 where the first column refers to the generated wave series number h is the wave height t is the wave period and l is the wavelength a rectangular bottom fixed owc system was selected for the experimental studies the opening height of the owc system towards the sea was adjustable for seven different opening heights 0 20 m 0 25 m 0 30 m 0 35 m 0 40 m 0 45 m and 0 50 m with a front wall thickness of 1 5 c m 0 55 m and 0 60 m values were also tried but due to the air leakage from chamber any consistent measurement could not be performed these different geometric parameters are shown in table 2 where x is the opening height and y is the immersion depth also α x h and β y h are defined as relative opening height and relative immersion depth respectively a power take off pto mechanism is represented by using a circular outlet with a 0 02 m radius r a 3d presentation and 2d plot for dimensions and shape of the owc system is shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively one side of the energy converter system was made transparent from plexiglass to observe the column water surface fluctuations inside the chamber constant geometric parameters are given in table 3 to measure the water column fluctuations inside the owc system three wave gauges were located on front wall wg1 center wg2 and rear wall wg3 in the chamber on the central axis in the direction of incident waves as shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively for calculating the water column surface fluctuations data obtained from wg1 wg2 and wg3 were averaged the sampling rate of the data collection was also 50 hz 3 results and discussion the water column surface fluctuations were measured under four different regular wave series for a constant water depth with various opening heights and surface profiles observed through the plexiglass side of the chamber with seven different opening heights and four different wave parameters 28 sets of experiments are conducted for constant water depth 60 cm every set of experiment was performed twice to avoid possible mistakes 3 1 effect of wave parameters it is well known that water column surface profile in the chamber is strongly related to the frequency of the incident progressive waves impinging on the converter through the opening morris thomas et al 2007 if the water column surface profile remains nearly horizontal under the excitation of the incident waves during oscillation the water column surface can be considered as a weightless rigid piston moving periodically but sometimes depending on the frequency of the incident waves the surface profile acts like an excited liquid in a closed container in a symmetric about the origin manner which can be defined as a sloshing motion profile for some cases water column action inside the chamber behaves as a combination of these two described profiles piston type and sloshing motion observations through the experiments indicated that when incoming wave frequency is less then a particular value piston type motion is generated in the chamber when a certain larger frequency value is exceeded sloshing motion is observed between these frequencies an interval exists with a narrow bandwidth which water column surface profile behavior comprises of both distinct motions these water column surface profiles generated in the chamber were same for all opening heights these profiles are shown in fig 7 transmitted wave height μ is defined as 2 μ d h where d is average water column surface fluctuation for one wave period and h is the incident wave height dimensionless wave frequency k h is described as 3 k h ω 2 g h k h tanh k h where k is the wave number which is equal to 2 π l ω is the angular frequency of the incident wave relative opening height α and relative immersion depth β are defined as 4 α x h 5 β y h where x is opening height of the chamber y is immersion depth and h is constant water depth the transmitted wave height μ versus k h graph is shown in fig 8 for different relative opening heights α corresponding k h values for different wave series are shown over the data points on the graph some of the exponential decay function fittings for a clear vision are included onto the graph for better interpretation of the data coefficient of correlation r2 values of all fittings are found to be in range between 0 991 and 0 997 it is realized at first glance that as the k h increases μ becomes smaller due to increasing contribution of sloshing behavior to the surface profile in the chamber it is observed that for the k h values 0 75 and 1 52 the behavior of the water column surface is approximately piston type motion when k h is 2 15 the profile behavior comprises of both type of motions where sloshing motion is dominant and for k h value 3 12 sloshing type of motion prevails therefore somewhere between 1 52 k h 2 15 but closer to the k h value 2 15 there should be a transition zone that the profile dominancy is transformed from one to another it is noteworthy that as k h gets smaller from transition zone towards the piston type generating values μ increases much more rapidly than other intervals since most of the contribution to the μ values comes from piston type motion in this interval a small increase in the k h causes a greater decrease for average μ values via increasing sloshing type of motion but as the piston type motion almost vanishes in the sloshing dominant and fully sloshing intervals and as the average μ values are already quite diminished in a fully and sloshing dominant surface profiles increasing k h values do not effect μ as much as in the opposite case these behaviors hold on for all relative opening heights except the effect of varying k h declines as α becomes smaller fig 8 shows that non linearity decreases as the immersion depth advances to bottom due to exponentially decay in energy as the gap between the bottom and the chamber closes down it leads to a relatively smaller change of transmission of wave energy as the k h varies consequently transmitted wave height is less sensitive to the effects of varying k h the most non linearity exponential growth is measured for α value 0 67 among others this value is important because bigger rate of change with respect to decreasing k h values is obtained this phenomenon and exponential decay in the energy will be further discussed later in the paper by using fig 8 for the particular design used in this experimental study for a given wave height h and period t or wave length l average chamber water column fluctuations in the chamber d can approximately be measured for any relative opening height except extreme cases using the exponentional fittings in case of a fully sloshing motion inside the chamber feasible amount of energy exploitation is almost impossible because the volume of the air in the chamber nearly stays constant thus trapped air above the water column can not be pressurized to further explain this phenomenon fig 9 shows the dimensionless time series t t time t divided by period of generated wave t for the transmitted wave heights at the front wall center and the rear wall of the chamber for the case 4 which α and β values are 0 58 and 0 42 respectively under the incident wave series number 4 this wave series has the highest frequency among the other ones which generates the smallest average fluctuations due to almost fully sloshing mode formed in the chamber at this point it is also noteworthy that for any other case the figure will look the same with a different sloshing amplitude transmitted wave heights measured with the wg3 which is located at the right hand side of the chamber has approximately 180 phase difference with the fluctuation value at the left hand side wg1 of the chamber and a very small fluctuation at the middle wg2 also it is seen from fig 9 that average water column surface fluctuation values are very small hence energy extraction could not be efficiently possible the opening height of the chamber did not effect this behavior of the surface profile but the difference is the increment for sloshing angle of the profile with increasing of the opening height this result is predictable because higher transmission of energy into the chamber takes place as the opening height increases under wave series w1 opposite case was observed the column water surface profile almost behaves without sloshing w1 has the smallest frequency among others fig 10 shows the transmitted wave height versus dimensionless time series for this situation as it is seen from fig 10 unlike the w4 measured values of transmitted wave heights for three positions are in phase they altogether contribute to the average transmitted wave height value in a building manner if we compare the averaged μ value with the central point it can be realized that they almost overlap each other so for this situation transmitted wave heights can be represented by the fluctuation value at the center of the surface as brendmo et al 1996 stated in their study it is reported that if the chamber width is very small compared to the exposed incident wave length water column surface profile behavior can be considered as piston type falnes and mciver 1985 captured wave length ratio δ is defined as 6 δ l l where l is the incident wave length and the l is the chamber length measured transmitted wave height values versus captured wave length ratios for different relative opening heights with the regression lines are depicted in fig 11 interestingly an impressive linear relationship exists between the two variables as it is seen from the fitted regression lines r2 values of all regression lines are approximately 1 μ values are highly dependent on captured wave length ratios these results are very essential for harnessing large amounts of energy the extreme cases fully sloshing and piston type motions occur for the interval δ 3 and δ 4 25 respectively somewhere between these captured wave length ratios there is a transition interval where water column surface behavior transforms from sloshing dominant to piston type dominant motion it is evident from the graph that when the water column is excited in a piston type manner the transmitted wave heights get bigger which is desired for higher efficiency therefore corresponding captured wave length intervals are of great importance as transmitted wave heights increase with bigger captured wave lengths when δ value moves from lower to higher values the piston behavior starts to dominate approximately around the δ value is 4 25 when δ value is around 3 75 surface profile transforms into sloshing dominant region and fully sloshing motion occurs at the approximate value of 3 to form a piston type motion behaviour in the chamber for higher efficiencies captured wave length ratios less than 4 should be strictly avoided furthermore fig 11 shows that this encountered phenomenon is valid for any relative opening height but the change is the increase in the variation of μ as the relative opening height gets bigger again the biggest slope was obtained when the α value was 0 67 which indicates the importance of this specific ratio 3 2 effects of varying opening height to understand the effects of varying opening heights on the water column surface fluctuations the wave parameters were kept constant the relative opening heights were altered under regular wave series given in table 1 at a constant water depth 0 60 m the results for the wave series that has the highest frequency are excluded since they are not of interest in terms of efficient energy extraction relative average water column surface fluctuation is defined as 7 η d h where d is average water column surface fluctuation and h is the water depth relative average water column surface fluctuation versus relative opening height is indicated in fig 12 with quadrating fittings for wave series w1 w2 and w3 as it is obviously seen from fig 12 largest η values were generated in the chamber when the ratio of the relative opening height is around 0 67 independent of wave parameters the relative average fluctuations increase from α values 0 33 to 0 67 while opposite trend is measured from 0 67 to 0 83 for all wave series after the peak ratio 0 67 relative average fluctuations decline more rapidly than they increased up to this value with the aid of observations what it is thought happening is for relative opening heights from 0 33 to 0 67 the profile behavior of the water column surface remains quite same whatever the profile was generated by the incident wave but after this ratio an additional sloshing motion is added to the behavior of the profile this sloshing motion decreases the fluctuations because of the averaging process of measurements at the locations of right center and left hand side of the chamber so there is a critical value around the ratio 0 67 that when exceeded the additional energy transmitted into the system is superimposed as a sloshing motion on to the surface profile the energy flux generated by incident waves are not distributed evenly below the surface it decreases exponentially towards the seabed so the higher contribution to the energy flux comes from the parts near the surface thus the additional transmitted part of the flux after the α value 0 67 is relatively higher this excessive flux forms greater reflection from the rear wall of the chamber as α value advances further beyond the critical value reflection grows in this manner when the higher transmitted rate of energy after the value 0 67 encounters the back wall of the owc structure a standing wave forms due to almost perfect reflection therefore the rate of energy transmission into the chamber is so high that additional conveyed energy into the chamber is transformed to kinetic energy in the form of vertical motion of the water particles near the rear wall due to reflection in turn stimulating the sloshing motion inside the chamber the vertical motion velocities of the water particles are very high at the right half especially at the back wall of the chamber since the remaining part of the water column can not keep pace with right half this excessive flux forms sloshing motion in the chamber that approximately generates 180 degrees of phase difference for the water column fluctuations and velocities between the front and rear wall then this symmetric about the origin type of motion is joined to the surface profile of the water column whatever it was after the α value 0 67 because we average them surface fluctuations start to decrease after the critical ratio is exceeded as it goes further beyond the value 0 67 the consequences are the same regardless of wave parameters in the previous section it is concluded that when captured wave length δ is less than an approximate value sloshing motion is generated in the chamber besides a relatively small captured wave length δ energy flux after the critical α value 0 67 also generates an additional sloshing motion inside the chamber so beyond this ratio additional energy transmitted into the chamber can be considered as an excessive harmful energy since it is not just turned into an unextractable form but it absorbs the already available energy up to this value this significant event should be taken into consideration seriously in designing owc systems furthermore this event is independent of wave parameters it becomes even more crucial if there are some fluctuations in the water level if such a phenomenon exists the relative opening height values should be chosen according to an appropriate range to harness the most energy in the owc plant service time 3 3 description of mathematical model for constant wave parameters in this experimental study to determine the effects of relative opening heights and immersion depths on the average water column fluctuations wave parameters were kept constant as the opening height and immersion depth were altered independent of the wave series used parameters of case 1 developed the smallest relative average water column surface fluctuation values that can be seen in fig 12 after inspection of the measured data a proportionality is found between relative average water column surface fluctuation η and a combination of power functions of α and β as follows 8 η β 1 1 α 2 this equation implies that η is proportional to the square of relative opening height α and relative immersion depth β raised to power 1 1 η versus β 1 1 α 2 plot with regression lines which have an average r2 0 96 value is shown in fig 13 for different wave series the only difference is the slope of the regression lines among the wave series w1 generates not only the highest average fluctuations in the chamber but also the biggest slope as β 1 1 α 2 value increases to further illustrate this proportionality the terms η i α i and β i will be introduced for i values 1 2 3 4 5 6 a n d 7 where subscript i indicates the case number therefore η i will represent the average water column surface fluctuation for corresponding values of α i and β i then these values will be normalized with respect to η 1 α 1 and β 1 as respectively 9 η i η 1 α i α 1 and β i β 1 it should be reminded that the η 1 is the smallest value generated in the chamber which represents the fluctuation value for case 1 as a result these ratios describe the variations of the corresponding values with respect to case 1 in order to eq 8 hold true also following expression should be correct for all i values and for all wave series 10 η i η 1 α i 2 α 1 2 β i 1 1 β 1 1 1 f α i β i the values of η i η 1 and f α i β i are depicted in fig 14 with varying dimensionless opening heights for all i values there exists a good fit between η i η 1 and f α i β i values that shows suggested proportionality in eq 8 is approximately accurate the reasoning for this proportionality could be explained in the following manner since the lowest point of the front wall was always under the still water surface during the experiments a partial reflection occurred depending on the immersion depth which in turn will form a partial standing wave having higher amplitude relative to the incident progressive wave as observed during our studies the amount of this amplification increases by the immersion depth increment while the reflection phenomenon from the front wall approaches to perfect reflection this leap in the wave height just in front of the chamber leads to an enhanced pressure distribution on the surface of inlet area because the pressure beneath the wave is proportional with wave height this pressure increment corresponds to a greater excitation force to the water column through the inlet section of the chamber resulting higher fluctuations it is also reasonable to expect a greater average fluctuation increasing exponentially inside the chamber as the relative opening height increases because as mentioned earlier the energy flux in a wave exponentially increases as it is ascended near the surface after the peak value of η i η 1 corresponding values of α and β assembles together in a manner such that η i η 1 values start to decrease from the plot we it can be also realized the peak point in fig 14 which corresponds to approximately α value 0 67 is very significant as we mentioned earlier because it is the value which generates the greatest fluctuation values and also when exceeded the relative average fluctuations start to decrease for further applicable cases in designing owc plants this critical value should be taken into consideration to the best of our knowledge since there is no reference to this critical phenomenon in the literature for different geometric design parameters this critical value notion and its approximate value has to be investigated it was stated that there existed a proportionality between η and β 1 1 α 2 with different proportionality ratios for each wave series as can be seen from fig 14 but when the normalized values of η and β 1 1 α 2 for all cases were plotted under different wave series in fig 15 interestingly it has been understood that variation of η values with respect to relative opening heights α do not depend on wave parameters normalized relative average fluctuation as a function of dimensionless opening height α can be represented by a quadratic regression curve quite accurately using the discrete data as plotted in fig 15 r2 of this regression curve is found to be 0 984 so this equation can be used to model the variations of relative water column surface fluctuations for any opening and immersion depth confidently one can predetermine the fluctuation variations regardless of wave parameters proportionality relationship which is eq 8 can be converted to an equation by introducing a proportionality constant c as follows 11 η c β 1 1 α 2 the value of the constant c can be calculated if any fluctuation d corresponding to a particular β and α values is known for a particular incident wave series eq 11 is valuable in terms of time money and labor consuming nature of the experimental studies before conducting further experiments fluctuation values can be computed for at least as a first approximation α and β values are related to each other with the equation 12 α β 1 hence eq 11 can be expressed as follows 13 η c 1 α 1 1 α 2 when η is differentiated with respect to α it leads to 14 d η d α c 2 α 1 α 1 1 1 1 α 2 1 α 0 1 to find the maximum value of η the eq 14 has to equalize to zero 15 d η d α c 2 α 1 α 1 1 1 1 α 2 1 α 0 1 0 the solution to eq 15 is possible if the expression in the parenthesis is equal to zero which becomes 16 2 α 1 α 1 1 1 1 α 2 1 α 0 1 0 α value obtained from the equation above is 0 65 which is very close to 0 67 the second derivative of η with respect to α yields the following equation 17 d 2 η d α 2 c 2 1 α 1 1 4 4 α 1 α 0 1 0 11 α 2 1 α 0 9 when α is equal to 0 65 the value of the d 2 η d α 2 is a negative number times c since c is always positive the conclusion is eq 11 reaches its maximum value when α 0 65 3 4 description of mathematical model for constant opening heights how relative average water column surface fluctuations depend on the wave parameters is also important for us because once the wave energy converter system is installed water column in the converter system will be excited by waves possessing different characteristics which can lead undesired efficiency problems therefore to predict the response of the system to diverse wave parameters is crucial because of this reason relative average fluctuation values were measured as incident wave series were altered while dimensionless opening heights held constant for all cases the experimental data indicate a proportional relationship as follows 18 η h l 2 this relationship for all relative opening heights with regression lines is plotted in fig 15 r2 values vary in range between 0 97 and 0 99 from the figure this linear relationship between η and h l 2 is obviously seen average water column surface fluctuation values have quadratic relationship with l and linear with h values that is predictable because it was observed previously that waves with higher wave lengths generate piston type motion that has higher transmission rates yield greater average fluctuations in the chamber wave height is of second priority since its effect is linear because the pressure distribution beneath the wave is proportional to wave height being proportional with h l 2 is valid for all opening heights with slightly different slopes as in the previous investigations the biggest slope is for α value 0 67 it is also evident that there is an admirable fit between the experimental data and experimental model finally two mathematical models eqs 8 and 18 can be combined to obtain a more general description of relative average water column fluctuations as follows 19 η β 1 1 α 2 h l 2 because there exists a good agreement between mathematical model results and experimental data proposed equations can be used in practical applications if any of the surface fluctuation value is known corresponding to any wave parameter proportionality constant can be determined then any variable can be changed to obtain corresponding relative average surface fluctuation value and actual fluctuation d in the chamber by using the water depth of course this is valid for fixed rectangular owc system with the design parameters used in this study but since fixed owc system are common and widely installed for testing purposes at different places with various wave climates falcao and henriques 2016 the results of this study will come in useful for further optimization studies 4 conclusions the optimization of the geometry and design of an owc system is very crucial under different wave climates water column surface fluctuations are the conveying processes for the transmission of wave power to pneumatic power so predicting its behavior under different sea conditions and different design parameters could give us an important knowledge to increase wave energy converter efficiency in this study effects of wave parameters and different opening height values on the chamber water surface profile and fluctuations of a bottom fixed rectangular owc system are investigated four different regular wave series and seven opening height values are experimentally studied under a constant water depth in a wave flume as frequency of incident wave gets smaller a greater portion of wave height transmitted wave height penetrates into the chamber this phenomenon is valid for all relative opening heights average chamber water column surface fluctuation d can be approximated accurately by the exponential fittings used in μ versus k h plot that follow the data closely for all relative opening heights a linear relationship is found between captured wave length ratio δ and transmitted wave height μ for relative opening height α a very crucial ratio is found which is around 0 67 relative opening height close to this value generates the highest average fluctuations in the chamber regardless of wave parameters furthermore if this ratio is exceeded average fluctuations start to decrease which should be taken into consideration in owc plant design using the experimental data relative average water column fluctuations are mathematically modeled in terms of relative opening height and wave parameters for all cases there exists a remarkable fit between mathmetical model and experimental data eq 19 may serve as a simple analytical tool to determine the average fluctuations in the chamber with respect to immersion depth and wave parameters in a practical way since optimization of front wall underwater geometry with different wave climates alter the fluctuations that generates the pressure oscillations within the trapped air derived mathematical model may be exploited by engineers and investigators for future studies sloshing motion of the surface profile should strictly be avoided in terms of energy harvesting waves with relatively high frequency generate sloshing motion in the chamber in addition to that from the observations of the study an additional cause for this phenomenon is found the energy defined as excessive harmful energy which is transmitted into the chamber after the critical relative opening ratio 0 67 forms additional sloshing motion for all the wave series the highest relative average column water surface fluctuations occur at relative opening height α is equal to 0 67 which is a unique value the amount of energy transmitted into the chamber after this ratio generates an additional sloshing motion to the water column which is called excessive harmful energy this phenomenon is another reason for sloshing motion regardless of wave parameters the critical α ratio 0 67 should be avoided in the geometric design the variation of average column water surface fluctuations computed as η η 1 with respect to varying relative opening heights α has been mathematically modeled by using only the variables relative opening height and relative immersion depth when the relative opening height is constant a similar mathematical model for approximating the same variations with respect to wave parameters is constructed physical experimental model results agree with mathematical model values remarkably after approximately computing the average chamber water column surface fluctuation d the variations for this value with respect to changing wave parameters and relative opening heights can further be calculated by the given mathematical models

23634,there are numerous designs and concepts that have been offered to extract energy from ocean waves a heaving buoy is distinguished as the most popular device which predominantly harnesses energy from the vertical motion in waves one such device is the bottom referenced submerged heaving buoy represented by the carnegie clean energy ceto system the total power absorption of this converter can be increased by replacing the single tether power take off system by a three tether mooring configuration thereby making motion controllable in heave and surge the current paper provides a comparative performance analysis of the generic submerged heaving buoy connected to one tether and the three tether converter in terms of the buoy motion and design of the power take off and mooring systems this is accompanied by a techno economic analysis of two converters keywords wave energy converter three tether mooring techno economic assessment cost related metrics power absorption 1 introduction along with wind and solar power ocean waves are a huge source of sustainable energy that still remain unexploited for electricity generation despite more than 40 years of intensive research and more than 200 wave energy converter wec designs there is no definitive answer to the question of what working principle is more suitable for shallow or deep water or what scale of the device is more economically viable as a result none of the existing designs has reached the commercial scale stage still remaining at the proof of concept development phase therefore researchers and engineers continue to look for new solutions in order to make wave power competitive with other sources of renewable energy along with various sizes and shapes wecs differ in operation principle including the mode of motion utilised to convert wave power thus heave surge and pitch of the structure are the main modes usually used in practice depending on the converter geometry and its location relative to the mean water surface the oscillatory motion of the wec in different modes radiates different types of waves leading to the different power absorption levels pecher and kofoed 2017 thus systems that combine several modes of motions have better hydrodynamic performance and the structure placed in water can be used more efficiently falnes 2002 as an example bottom referenced heaving buoys similar to the ceto system carnegie wave energy limited 2015 are designed to absorb power from the vertical motion in waves see fig 1 a while heave has a major contribution to the power absorption due to a flexible tether connection between the buoy hull the power take off system and the seabed the structure can experience movement in all degrees of freedom in order to increase the efficiency of such wecs it has been suggested srokosz 1979 to use a three cable mooring configuration see fig 1b which allows to control motion of the buoy in both heave and surge and to some extend in pitch interestingly that an added degree of freedom e g surge can significantly improve the performance of fully submerged quasi point absorbers while the efficiency of their floating counterparts will increase only in a limited range of wave periods sergiienko et al 2017 the concept of the three tether wec was introduced by srokosz 1979 where a submerged spherical buoy was attached to three cables that were equally spaced around the buoy and each cable was connected to an individual power take off machinery the study was conducted in the frequency domain and demonstrated up to a threefold increase in power production as compared to the same buoy connected to only one cable later the three tether converter with a floating cylindrical buoy was used as a prototype for the control system design lattanzio and scruggs 2011 scruggs et al 2013 further analysis has been focused on the design features of the three tether wec with an objective to identify the optimal arrangement of tethers which can provide the maximum power output of the converter sergiienko et al 2016a in addition there is an interest in developing wave energy arrays consisting of multi tether buoys due to the benefit of shared moorings wu et al 2016 arbònes et al 2016 at the initial stage of any prototype development the main research focus is given to the technical side of the problem efficiency of the wec under regular waves with idealised control a dependence of the device performance on the geometry and constraints etc however when it comes to the commercialisation of a particular converter other factors become significant for investors thus the system with the best hydrodynamic performance does not necessarily guarantee the cheapest electricity production pecher and kofoed 2017 therefore recently considerable attention has been given to the techno economic assessments of the wec development since only a few devices have been built in full scale and undertaken in ocean testing the amount of information on levelised costs or capital operational expenditures of wecs is limited therefore a number of indirect cost related criteria has been developed for converters at low technology readiness level babarit et al 2011 2012 regarding the three tether wec the preliminarily results of its performance in irregular waves have been presented in sergiienko et al 2016b including the estimation of energy delivery and other indirect techno economic indices the current paper demonstrates a feasibility study of the three tether wave energy converter with one shape of the buoy hull descriptions of the system and modelling routine are specified in sections 2 and 3 respectively the performance of the wec and expected power output are presented in the form of comparative analysis between the single tether and three tether wecs in section 4 uncertainties associated with the modelling assumptions are quantified in sections 5 and 6 finally the techno economic analysis of the three tether wec is presented in section 7 2 description of the system 2 1 buoy currently there is no physical prototype for a three tether wave energy converter which can be used for analysis in the current study therefore it has been decided to utilise a generic shape namely a vertical cylinder whose hydrodynamic behaviour has been thoroughly studied yeung 1981 jiang et al 2014 in practice corners of the buoy should be rounded to reduce drag and viscous losses pecher and kofoed 2017 but for the numerical modelling in this study only the aspect ratio of the device is important the geometrical dimensions of the buoy hull are selected to be similar to the ceto 5 system as specified in table 1 2 2 power take off configuration in the current study it is assumed that each tether is connected to an individual power take off pto mechanism which can be implemented as an electric generator scruggs et al 2013 or a hydraulic circuit ding et al 2016 for the three tether wec it is possible to place the pto system inside the buoy hull where all three hydraulic cylinders drive the same power generator hansen et al 2011 the behaviour of the hydraulic system is usually described by the coulomb damping force babarit et al 2011 however in order to exclude uncertainties associated with a specific pto design it is presumed that the machinery force has linear spring and damper effects proportional to the tether extension and the rate of change of the tether extension respectively 2 3 sea site there is a range of sea site locations that can be used to assess the overall performance of the wecs including australia australian wave energy atlas 2016 europe babarit et al 2011 or the usa however yeu island located in france has been extensively used as a benchmark site for the comparison of various wec prototypes babarit et al 2012 de andres et al 2016 and therefore will be considered in this study the wave data statistics and parameters of the site are specified in fig 2 location 46 40

this study is based on linear wave theory assuming small motion amplitudes of the buoy as compared to the length of the mooring lines tethers the only second order hydrodynamic effect included in the model is a viscous drag force which is proportional to the square of the body velocity relative to the fluid 3 1 kinematics a schematic of a three tether wec is shown on fig 3 the spatial arrangement

0 denotes the initial tether length the above equations illustrate the cross coupling between modes and are used to calculate the response amplitude operators presented in section 4 1 1 3 5 power absorption energy can be generated by the pto machinery only when the tether attached to it is under tension as a result the total instantaneous power absorbed by the wec is calculated as 19 p σ t i 1 3 p i t i 1 3 f t i t δ l i t if f t i 0 3 6 model implementation hydrodynamic coefficients of the wec in the frequency domain have been obtained using an analytical solution jiang et al 2014 and verified against wamit lee 1995 see fig 4 in order to conduct the time domain simulations equation 13 has been implemented in simulink matlab with a time step of 0 01 s using the ode45 solver the duration of all simulation runs has been set to 300 t p but not less than 1200 s and the first 15 t p have not been included in the analysis due to initial transient states the convolution integral in equation 13 has been replaced by a state space model using the marine system simulator toolbox perez and fossen 2009 the irregular wave time series have been implemented using the pierson moskowitz wave spectrum the specialist committee on waves 2002 over the grid of significant wave heights of h s 0 5 7 5 m and peak wave periods t p 3 17 sec in all simulations waves propagate along the x axis making the first tether aligned with the direction of the incident wave drag coefficients have been taken from hoerner 1965 and set to c x c y 1 c z 1 1 and b x z b y z 0 2 the hard stop spring coefficient is set to k h s min k h s max 10 8 n m the pto control parameters k p t o b p t o are simultaneously optimised for each sea state using simulink design optimization toolbox with an objective function to maximise the mean value of the generated power over the duration of the simulation max k p t o b p t o p σ t the model of the single tether wec is adapted from babarit et al 2011 and will not be repeated in this paper all simulation parameters are consistent with the three tether case except the pto control settings which are optimised separately for the single tether system optimal values of the pto control parameters for the single and three tether wecs are shown in fig 5 these pto settings are used to generate results in section 4 4 comparison of performance between single and three tether buoys the main distinctive features of the three tether wec are demonstrated in this section including motion amplitudes acting forces and power output 4 1 buoy motion 4 1 1 resonance frequency in the absence of a power take off and mooring systems the natural frequency of neutrally buoyant submerged wecs approaches zero due to the absence of the hydrostatic stiffness in all degrees of freedom dof for submerged buoys the mooring lines and the pto system provide the only stiffness to the plant which controls its resonance behaviour and mode shapes the conventional motion modes such as surge heave or pitch become coupled not only hydrodynamically but also through the tether arrangement which is indicated by the presence of the off diagonal terms in the k p t o matrix see equation 18 the behaviour of such coupled multi dof systems can be investigated using eigenvectors and eigenvalues adapted from vibration analysis for details see ding et al 2017 as a result resonance frequencies of the wec described by equation 14 can be found solving the eigenvalue problem 20 m a 1 k p t o ω 0 2 i 0 where i is the identity matrix for the single tether wec the exact solution of equation 20 in heave is 21 ω 0 h e a v e k p t o m b a 33 ω 0 while for surge pitch coupled modes the expressions are more complex however by drawing an analogy of the bottom referenced heaving buoy with an inverted pendulum the resonance frequency of a single tether buoy in surge pitch can be approximated by 22 ω 0 s u r g e g m w m b l 0 m b a 11 ω 0 thus while the resonance of the single tether wec in heave can be controlled by changing the pto stiffness k p t o the buoy behaviour in surge is only dependant on such parameters as the mass ratio m b m w and the initial tether length l 0 in contrast the pto configuration of the three tether wec allows the control of both heave and surge due to the additional coupling through inclined mooring lines to demonstrate the effect of the resonance frequency on the wec s performance the response amplitude operators raos of the single and three tether converters with fixed control parameters k p t o 10 5 n m and b p t o 10 5 n m s are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively dashed lines correspond to exact solutions of equation 20 for each wec it is clear from the plots that none of these mooring configurations can effectively control angular rotation of the buoy which is evident from very large pitch amplitudes at higher frequencies however pitch motion of the single tether wec has two resonance peaks due to the undamped coupling with surge while there is only one peak for the three tether case also the latter configuration demonstrates effective coupling of heave and surge leading to the same degenerate resonance frequency 4 1 2 motion envelope due to the fact that the surge motion of the single tether wec cannot be controlled by the pto machinery the buoy may experience large displacements in the horizontal direction depending on the sea state conditions moreover the nominal operation position of such wecs can vary with time due the presence of ocean currents and wave drift forces in the case of the three tether wec the buoy motion is constrained and controlled in all translational degrees of freedom and the motion envelope of the structure is governed by the maximum stroke lengths and the tether inclination angle for the demonstration purposes motion envelopes of the single tether and three tether wecs in irregular waves of h s 3 m and t p 14 sec are shown in fig 8 data is represented in terms of the frequency of the buoy position occurrence over 4200 s the white borders outline the area in the x z plane where the buoy can operate without reaching hard stop mechanisms as expected the three tether wec motion has a circular nature due to the arrangements of mooring lines while the single tether converter swings a lot in surge similar to the inverted pendulum mechanism there is another criterion commonly used to analyse the motion of the surface buoys and vessels which is called watch circle steele et al 2009 it indicates the area diameter on the water surface within which the moored structure can move a similar performance related measure has been introduced for the comparison of various wecs that participated in the recent wave energy prize competition arranged by the u s department of energy 2016 thus the statistical peak not the maximum value of the mooring watch circle has been calculated based on the major axis of the watch circle as fully submerged wecs operate under water all the time it is possible to assume that the watch circle is the area in the horizontal plane formed by the buoy motion in surge and sway in our study the statistical peak refers to the 99 confidence level of the buoy displacement in surge a comparison between statistical peaks of the mooring watch circle for the single and three tether wecs over the range of sea states is demonstrated in fig 9 for both tether configurations the buoy displacement in surge increases with the wave height and the peak wave period however for the single tether case the mooring watch circle can reach up to 10 m in energetic sea states while for the three tether wec the motion is constrained within the 4 5 m circle 4 1 3 pitch the angular motion of both single and three tether wecs in pitch cannot be directly controlled by the pto system but it affects the total performance of the wec through coupled dynamics also if significant pitching occurs the buoy may experience surface wave breaking and undesired additional loads on the system the comparison of the statistical peak values of the pitch angle of the single and three tether wecs are shown in fig 10 as a result angular rotation of the three tether buoy remains less than 30 deg even for waves with high amplitudes while pitch angle of the single tether wec can reach 44 deg however these peak values represent mostly extreme operational conditions for each system while the significant pitch angle calculated as the root mean square over the time series shows that the angular rotation of both converters will be less than 10 deg on average 4 2 mooring system one of the biggest differences between single and three tether configurations is a mooring system design first of all the footprint of the multi mooring wec may reach 100 m in diameter in 50 m water depth while the single point mooring is limited by the dimensions of its anchorage this fact can be regarded as a drawback of the three tether system causing difficulties for the wec installation due to the uneven surface of the seabed however in the long term perspective wave energy converters will operate in groups forming wave energy farms babarit 2013 and the three tether buoys have a potential to share mooring points with adjacent devices gaudin et al 2017 as shown in fig 11 another distinctive feature of the mooring systems is the direction of the cyclic loading applied from the buoy the taut moored systems with a single line should withstand large vertical forces and a common type of the mooring arrangement for such systems is a gravity anchor or a piled foundation harris et al 2004 for the three tether wec the mooring system experiences inclined loading with a lower magnitude as the total acting force is distributed between three mooring points moreover the resistance of a pile to inclined loading is much higher as compared to the vertical loading of the same amplitude herduin et al 2016 therefore each pile for the three tether configuration is potentially smaller in diameter and in length than that for the single tether wec for comparison peak tether forces experienced by the single and three tether wecs are demonstrated in fig 12 as a result loading on each mooring point from the three tether wec is half that of the single tether device however wave tank experiments should be conducted in order to identify extreme not statistical peak forces acting on the structure rafiee et al 2016 4 3 end hard stop and tether slackness each wec should be equipped with an end stop mechanism in order to keep the buoy motion within desired boundaries the behaviour of the hard stop system is governed by equation 7 as shown in fig 8 displacements of the three tether converter are constrained more as compared to the single tether wec which leads to the greater chance of hitting end stop limits the occurrence of the hard stop events for both converters is demonstrated in fig 13 as a result for significant wave heights less than 2 5 m motion of buoys stays within set boundaries however for higher waves impact events occur twice as often for the three tether wec than for the heaving buoy this situation is not desirable for the wave converter and can be avoided using longer strokes or advanced control algorithms hals et al 2011 for example increasing the pto damping or detuning the wec under high sea states another situation that should be considered with caution is a slackness of tethers due to the positive buoyancy of the submerged converters tethers should be under tension all the time in order to effectively transmit the buoy motion in waves into the translational or rotational motion of the pto system however mooring lines can become slack because of the large wave excitation forces or additional forces exerted from the hard stop mechanisms when the tether become loose and then re tighten the wec experiences high snapping loads which may cause damage to the pto and mooring systems as can be seen from fig 14 the three tether converters are more exposed to such events due to the lower initial tension in each tether so the mass to buoyancy ratio of the three tether wec should be chosen in such a way as to provide a required pre tension force in all mooring lines 4 4 power output the power output of both converters has been analysed in terms of the peak to average ratio the contribution of individual pto systems and different motion modes to the averaged absorbed power 4 4 1 power matrix the averaged absorbed power and also statistical peak power for the single tether and three tether wecs are shown in fig 15 where control parameters have been optimised for each sea state the power output of the wec attached to three tethers is approximately two times higher than that of the single tether device across all sea states for example at the wave climate with h s 2 m and t p 9 s the power output of the converter with multiple mooring lines reaches 82 kw while the same buoy with a single tether shows 41 kw of absorbed power however this factor of 2 is a feature of the particular buoy geometry considered in this study for other shapes and aspect ratios the increase in power production can be in the range of 1 6 2 5 times sergiienko et al 2016b the level of instantaneous power for both converters is approximately 6 10 times higher than the mean power value meaning that the designed capacity of the pto should be an order of magnitude higher than the expected average energy output 4 4 2 power per pto system as stated the power take off for the three tether wec can be implemented in several ways for the case of individual pto units for each mooring line they make different contribution to the total power output the tether arrangement shown in fig 3 demonstrates only one extreme case when tether 1 is aligned with the direction of wave propagation for this configuration the pto attached to tether 1 generates approximately 45 of the total mean power for the most sea states as shown on fig 16 a the other two ptos convert the rest of the energy with an equal share due to the symmetrical arrangement of the tethers arrangement with respect to y axis thus depending on the wave direction statistics the first pto system may be designed to be larger than the other two another extreme situation is when one of tethers operates perpendicular to the wave front with almost zero power output however according to the preliminary results in frequency domain sergiienko et al 2016a the total power output of the wec is largely unaffected by wave direction relative to the arrangement of the mooring lines the comparison of power absorption between both converters is demonstrated in fig 16b showing that the three tether wec can generate approximately 1 8 2 2 times more power than its single tether counterpart to explain the main reason why the improvement is only twofold and not three times as derived in newman 1976 the budal diagram as cited in falnes and hals 2012 for the single and three tether wecs is shown in fig 17 a assuming optimal control at each wave period the blue area on the plot corresponds to the radiation limit where buoy displacements are not constrained and power production is only governed by the mode of oscillation as a result the maximum increase in the wec efficiency can be up to three times if both heave and surge contribute to the power take off the red area in fig 17a shows the range of wave periods where the buoy displacements reach constraints and power absorption limits depend on the buoy shape and maximum allowed displacements the q factor in fig 17b corresponds to the increase of the power production for a three tether case when compared with its single tether counterpart thus its values vary between 1 85 and 2 7 depending on the wave period as the irregular waves are composed from the number of waves with different frequencies the overall effect of having three tethers quality factor is averaged to the level of 2 2 2 as shown in fig 16 4 4 3 power per mode since the main idea of the application of three mooring lines is to capture power from the buoy motion in surge it is important to show how much energy is converted from each motion mode the power contribution from one mode is calculated as the difference between excitation power radiated power and viscous losses 23 p m o d e p e x c p r a d p v i s where p denotes the time average power the relative contribution from surge heave and pitch modes is shown in fig 18 for the range of sea states as expected for the single tether wec the heave motion provides around 90 95 of the total power while the remaining 5 are produced by surge interestingly the buoy oscillations in pitch have a negative impact on the power production which is indicated by the bars placed above 1 on the plot this loss is presumably due to extremely poor coupling between pitch motion of the buoy and the pto so useful work is minimal whereas losses due to radiation and drag remain high in contrast in the three tether configuration pitch has a negligible effect on the wec performance in terms of the absorbed power in general slightly more than half of the energy 50 55 is generated from the heave while the remaining 45 50 are produced from surge the contribution from surge decreases by several percent with an increasing wave height interestingly the three tether wec demonstrates slightly higher by 5 efficiency of the heave mode as compared to the single tether device which is indicated by the numbers on bars this may be caused by the different arrangements of motion envelopes as shown in fig 8 5 system sensitivity in this section the sensitivity of the power output to changes of some geometric parameters is investigated for the three tether wec for the yeu site 5 1 buoy mass the mass ratio of the buoy plays an important role in the design of the bottom referenced wec as it governs the loading on the mooring system affecting dimensions of the foundation and therefore the total cost of the converter thus the sensitivity of the power output to the mass of the three tether wec is demonstrated in fig 19 a control parameters have been optimised for each mass ratio presented as a result more energy can be generated using lighter buoy hulls while the variation in mass by 40 from the default value of m b m w 0 5 results in 10 5 change in power absorption however such relatively small gain 5 in the averaged power is also associated with a significant increase in loading on the mooring system by 1 4 times 5 2 tether stroke the length of the tether stroke governs the motion envelope of the converter and the frequency of contacting end stop mechanisms an influence of the tether stroke length on the power absorption abilities of the three tether wec is shown in fig 19a control parameters have been optimised for each value of the tether stroke over the range of sea states it is interesting to note that a change in the stroke by several metres corresponds to a marginal increase in the averaged power only 2 however it significantly affects the frequency of the end stop events and the value of 8 m 4 m seems to be the most appropriate for the current buoy design however the choice of the maximum tether stroke is generally governed not by the operational sea states but by the extreme wave conditions and requires further investigation using more accurate numerical or experimental methods rafiee and fiévez 2015 another approach is to employ control algorithms that keep displacements of the buoy within pre set boundary values without engagement with end stops hals et al 2011 5 3 tether angle the spatial arrangement of tethers is determined by i their inclination angle to the vertical and ii the anchor point of each tether to the buoy hull in this work it is assumed that all tethers point towards the geometric centre of the buoy as shown in fig 20 a such configuration minimises an influence of the power take off system on the angular motion of the wec however when the mooring lines are attached at the larger radius as shown in fig 20b the kinematic coupling between the angular motion of the buoy and change in the tether length increases the performance of the three tether wec has been analysed with a range of tether angles α 40 50 and the tether anchor point angles α a p 30 65 with optimal pto settings for each sea state the sensitivity of the mean absorbed power to the tether arrangement is shown in fig 19c where the black dot corresponds to the maximum power output at the yeu site black contour lines show 95 and 99 confidence intervals and the dashed line demonstrates the case when α a p α it can be seen from the plot that it is not necessary to have all tethers point towards the geometric centre of the buoy and a slight offset of the anchor point to a larger radius on the buoy hull increases power generation of the three tether wec thus the angles that maximise the absorbed power are α 45 and α a p 51 however the change of both angles by 5 from its optimal value will only result in 5 reduction in power 6 modelling uncertainties the numerical modelling of the wec in this study is associated with a number of assumptions including i hydrodynamic parameters are obtained using linear wave theory ii viscous drag coefficients are taken from published literature iii control parameters are optimised for each sea state uncertainties associated with the first assumption can be quantified only conducting an experimental study or using numerical results from the computational fluid dynamics simulations rafiee and valizadeh 2017 while the last two can be evaluated by varying the default value of a particular parameter 6 1 viscous losses the averaged absorbed power of the three tether wec has been calculated for the range of viscous drag coefficients and presented in fig 21 the horizontal axis corresponds to the change of the drag coefficients relative to its nominal default value used in this study thus the matrices c d and b q from equations 11 and 12 have been multiplied by the corresponding scale factor control parameters have been optimised for each value of the drag coefficient as a result uncertainties of 50 associated with a modelling of viscous losses result in power production uncertainties of 16 11 6 2 control in this work it has been assumed that the pto systems have a linear behaviour and control parameters have been optimised for each sea state in order to quantify uncertainties associated with this the performance of the wec has been evaluated using different sets of pto parameters and presented in fig 22 as a result uncertainties associated with the implementation of control are 22 0 the overall uncertainty caused by the modelling assumptions is 27 11 however for the wec at such a low development stage it is more common to assume errors within 40 40 7 economic assessment in this section two different approaches are used to assess the practicality of the three tether wec 7 1 cost breakdown and scaling to the three tether wec whilst there is an increase in the power production from the three tether wec there is also an increase in the total capital cost of the converter due to the additional power take off machinery and mooring systems thus using the cost breakdown of the submerged heaving buoy each individual component should be scaled accordingly to the 3 tether wec leading to the total capital cost scaling factor despite the fact that wave companies are reluctant to share detailed information associated with a breakdown of costs there is a number of publications which can be used as a basis for capital expenditure capex breakdown of the wave energy converters the data is summarised in table 2 specifying the source of information date of publication and the prototype considered for the cases where the levelised cost of electricity lcoe has been presented including capex and opex operating expenditure the components of capex have been isolated and their contribution re calculated in order to match the items in table 2 despite the fact that capex models presented in table 2 vary significantly the relative efficiency of the three tether wec is calculated assuming that each cost breakdown represents the single tether case the following steps are undertaken in order to estimate how the cost of the three tether wec differs from the single tether device due to the additional power take off mechanisms and mooring points i apply a capex model ii scale each item for the three tether wec according to table 3 scaling factors are chosen such that in the most unfavourable case the cost of pto foundation and its installation are tripled while the grid connection has a factor of 2 due to the doubling of the power output iii calculate the total capital cost economic scaling factor iv estimate the relative efficiency of the three tether converter as a ratio between the power production gain and the associated increase in the wec cost the resultant data for the three tether wec using each capex model are added to the bottom of table 2 three out of six models bedard et al 2005 neary et al 2014 show that the three tether wec is more beneficial from the economic point of view as compared to its single tether counterpart another two teillant et al 2012 paredes et al 2013 demonstrate that there is only a marginal advantage of having multiple mooring lines when using the conservative scaling factor in table 3 according to the cost breakdown presented by carbon trust entec uk ltd 2006 it seems unprofitable to invest in the three tether wecs this negative result is associated with a fairly large proportion of the pto system 49 in the total cost of the converter a simple calculation shows that if the power take off and mooring systems and their installation make up more than half the total cost of the wec with one tether then the three tether converter would become uneconomical to manufacture as the capex breakdown models that are publicly available differ greatly from case to case from country to country and also depending on the number of wecs involved in the farm it is very difficult to draw a definitive conclusion on the three tether wec however it is important to note that even with very conservative scaling factors the three tether wec appears to outperform the single tether wec 7 2 cost related metrics data in table 2 clearly show that there is a lot of unknowns and uncertainties associated with the financial side of the wave energy production therefore to simplify the analysis of any wec it has been suggested to use several cost related metrics babarit et al 2012 arguing that the significant mass or wetted surface can indirectly represent the total cost of the wec these parameters take into account the buoy hull and the foundation for the wec installation the most important criteria are i relative capture width hydrodynamic efficiency ii annual energy output per significant mass iii annual energy output per significant wetted surface iv annual energy output per significant tether force following a similar approach and assuming that the three tether and the single tether converters have piled foundations the comparison of performance measures is demonstrated in table 4 furthermore other parameters specific for the taut moored wecs such as the end stop impact events and also slack tether events have been added to the analysis in order to calculate the significant mass and wetted surface it has been assumed that the single tether wec has the same foundation as the ceto 5 system according to images found in carnegie wave energy limited 2013 the parameters of the pile used for ceto 5 are length is 20 m diameter is 2 m and the wall thickness is approximately 0 15 m taking these dimensions as a reference and assuming that piles are manufactured from steel the mass of foundation for the single tether wec can be estimated to be around 150 t and the surface area to be 125 m2 leading to the total significant mass of 420 t and the total wetted surface of around 505 m2 as stated in section 4 2 piles for the three tether wec should be smaller per unit force due to the distributed loading between three mooring points thus it is assumed that the mass and wetted surface of each pile for the multi tether system is half of those manufactured for ceto 5 therefore the significant mass of the three tether wec is assumed to be 496 t and the total wetted surface is 569 m3 according to data presented in table 4 the only drawback associated with the three tether wec is the frequency of the end stop impact events and chances of slack tethers this issue may be addressed extending the tether stroke as shown in section 5 2 and applying advanced control strategies in order to keep the motion of the buoy within desired boundaries other techno economic metrics indicate that the three tether wec has a potential to double the power output as well as to produce cheaper electricity as compared to the same buoy with a single tether configuration 7 3 ace another complex metric called average climate capture width per characteristic capital expenditure ace has been offered recently for assessing wecs at a low technology readiness level u s department of energy 2016 characteristic capital expenditure can be calculated using the following formula characteristic capital expenditure total surface area m 2 structural thickness m material density kg m 3 cost of material kg in de andres et al 2016 the ace index is calculated for the range of wecs using the price of steel as 0 615 kg and the density of steel as 7900 kg m3 in order to be consistent with de andres et al 2016 and to make a comparison of the three tether device with other wec prototypes the same values are used in this paper taking data from table 4 ace can be calculated as a c e 1 t e t h e r 3 12 m 420 10 3 kg 0 615 kg 12 08 m m a c e 3 t e t h e r 6 24 m 496 10 3 kg 0 615 kg 20 46 m m as ace is correlated with the performance index annual power output per significant mass the higher ace is obtained for the three tether wec moreover the comparison of this metric has been performed for the range of converters refer to de andres et al 2016 and it appears that the three tether wec demonstrates the second best ace out of 9 wecs included in the study in de andres et al 2016 8 conclusion the performance of the submerged three tether wec has been analysed in irregular waves using the state of the art methods the submerged three tether wec has a potential to absorb twice as much power as the submerged heaving buoy while reducing load on the mooring system due to the additional constraints from the multi tether configuration the buoy experiences much less displacement in the horizontal direction moreover surge is effectively coupled to the power take off system and contributes the same amount of power as heave the economic assessment also demonstrated that despite doubling the power the three tether wec can produce cheaper electricity as compared to the same buoy with a single tether configuration acknowledgement this research has been supported by the australian government research training program scholarship and by the australian research council linkage project lp130100117 this work has been conducted using supercomputing resources provided by the phoenix hpc service at the university of adelaide 
23634,there are numerous designs and concepts that have been offered to extract energy from ocean waves a heaving buoy is distinguished as the most popular device which predominantly harnesses energy from the vertical motion in waves one such device is the bottom referenced submerged heaving buoy represented by the carnegie clean energy ceto system the total power absorption of this converter can be increased by replacing the single tether power take off system by a three tether mooring configuration thereby making motion controllable in heave and surge the current paper provides a comparative performance analysis of the generic submerged heaving buoy connected to one tether and the three tether converter in terms of the buoy motion and design of the power take off and mooring systems this is accompanied by a techno economic analysis of two converters keywords wave energy converter three tether mooring techno economic assessment cost related metrics power absorption 1 introduction along with wind and solar power ocean waves are a huge source of sustainable energy that still remain unexploited for electricity generation despite more than 40 years of intensive research and more than 200 wave energy converter wec designs there is no definitive answer to the question of what working principle is more suitable for shallow or deep water or what scale of the device is more economically viable as a result none of the existing designs has reached the commercial scale stage still remaining at the proof of concept development phase therefore researchers and engineers continue to look for new solutions in order to make wave power competitive with other sources of renewable energy along with various sizes and shapes wecs differ in operation principle including the mode of motion utilised to convert wave power thus heave surge and pitch of the structure are the main modes usually used in practice depending on the converter geometry and its location relative to the mean water surface the oscillatory motion of the wec in different modes radiates different types of waves leading to the different power absorption levels pecher and kofoed 2017 thus systems that combine several modes of motions have better hydrodynamic performance and the structure placed in water can be used more efficiently falnes 2002 as an example bottom referenced heaving buoys similar to the ceto system carnegie wave energy limited 2015 are designed to absorb power from the vertical motion in waves see fig 1 a while heave has a major contribution to the power absorption due to a flexible tether connection between the buoy hull the power take off system and the seabed the structure can experience movement in all degrees of freedom in order to increase the efficiency of such wecs it has been suggested srokosz 1979 to use a three cable mooring configuration see fig 1b which allows to control motion of the buoy in both heave and surge and to some extend in pitch interestingly that an added degree of freedom e g surge can significantly improve the performance of fully submerged quasi point absorbers while the efficiency of their floating counterparts will increase only in a limited range of wave periods sergiienko et al 2017 the concept of the three tether wec was introduced by srokosz 1979 where a submerged spherical buoy was attached to three cables that were equally spaced around the buoy and each cable was connected to an individual power take off machinery the study was conducted in the frequency domain and demonstrated up to a threefold increase in power production as compared to the same buoy connected to only one cable later the three tether converter with a floating cylindrical buoy was used as a prototype for the control system design lattanzio and scruggs 2011 scruggs et al 2013 further analysis has been focused on the design features of the three tether wec with an objective to identify the optimal arrangement of tethers which can provide the maximum power output of the converter sergiienko et al 2016a in addition there is an interest in developing wave energy arrays consisting of multi tether buoys due to the benefit of shared moorings wu et al 2016 arbònes et al 2016 at the initial stage of any prototype development the main research focus is given to the technical side of the problem efficiency of the wec under regular waves with idealised control a dependence of the device performance on the geometry and constraints etc however when it comes to the commercialisation of a particular converter other factors become significant for investors thus the system with the best hydrodynamic performance does not necessarily guarantee the cheapest electricity production pecher and kofoed 2017 therefore recently considerable attention has been given to the techno economic assessments of the wec development since only a few devices have been built in full scale and undertaken in ocean testing the amount of information on levelised costs or capital operational expenditures of wecs is limited therefore a number of indirect cost related criteria has been developed for converters at low technology readiness level babarit et al 2011 2012 regarding the three tether wec the preliminarily results of its performance in irregular waves have been presented in sergiienko et al 2016b including the estimation of energy delivery and other indirect techno economic indices the current paper demonstrates a feasibility study of the three tether wave energy converter with one shape of the buoy hull descriptions of the system and modelling routine are specified in sections 2 and 3 respectively the performance of the wec and expected power output are presented in the form of comparative analysis between the single tether and three tether wecs in section 4 uncertainties associated with the modelling assumptions are quantified in sections 5 and 6 finally the techno economic analysis of the three tether wec is presented in section 7 2 description of the system 2 1 buoy currently there is no physical prototype for a three tether wave energy converter which can be used for analysis in the current study therefore it has been decided to utilise a generic shape namely a vertical cylinder whose hydrodynamic behaviour has been thoroughly studied yeung 1981 jiang et al 2014 in practice corners of the buoy should be rounded to reduce drag and viscous losses pecher and kofoed 2017 but for the numerical modelling in this study only the aspect ratio of the device is important the geometrical dimensions of the buoy hull are selected to be similar to the ceto 5 system as specified in table 1 2 2 power take off configuration in the current study it is assumed that each tether is connected to an individual power take off pto mechanism which can be implemented as an electric generator scruggs et al 2013 or a hydraulic circuit ding et al 2016 for the three tether wec it is possible to place the pto system inside the buoy hull where all three hydraulic cylinders drive the same power generator hansen et al 2011 the behaviour of the hydraulic system is usually described by the coulomb damping force babarit et al 2011 however in order to exclude uncertainties associated with a specific pto design it is presumed that the machinery force has linear spring and damper effects proportional to the tether extension and the rate of change of the tether extension respectively 2 3 sea site there is a range of sea site locations that can be used to assess the overall performance of the wecs including australia australian wave energy atlas 2016 europe babarit et al 2011 or the usa however yeu island located in france has been extensively used as a benchmark site for the comparison of various wec prototypes babarit et al 2012 de andres et al 2016 and therefore will be considered in this study the wave data statistics and parameters of the site are specified in fig 2 location 46 40

this study is based on linear wave theory assuming small motion amplitudes of the buoy as compared to the length of the mooring lines tethers the only second order hydrodynamic effect included in the model is a viscous drag force which is proportional to the square of the body velocity relative to the fluid 3 1 kinematics a schematic of a three tether wec is shown on fig 3 the spatial arrangement of all tethers is defined by s i 1 s i r r n i d i i 1 3 where r is the position vector of a buoy in the reference coordinate frame o x y z r is the rotation matrix of the buoy with respect to the reference frame n i denotes the position vector of the anchor point of the i th tether on the hull relative to the buoy centre of mass g d i is the position vector of the anchor point of the i th tether on the sea floor in the o x y z coordinate frame the instantaneous tether length is 2 l i s i s i s i i 1 3 and the change in length of the i th tether is δ l i l i l 0 mapping from the buoy velocities in a cartesian coordinate frame to the rate of change of the tether length is provided by the inverse kinematic jacobian 3 q j 1 x where x r θ is the buoy location pose vector with three translational and three rotational motions q l 1 l 2 l 3 is a vector of three tether length variables and the inverse kinematic jacobian j 1 can be obtained as 4 j 1 e s 1 r n 1 e s 1 e s 2 r n 2 e s

vectors of six elements including horizontal and vertical forces and rotational moments 3 2 1 hydrostatic force as the buoy is fully submerged the generalised hydrostatic force is f b u o y 0 0 m w m b g 0 0 0 where m w ρ v is the mass of the displaced water ρ is water density v is the displaced volume of the buoy and m b is the mass of the wec 3 2 2 power take off forces a behaviour of the linear pto system is modelled as babarit et al 2011 5 f p t o i c p t o b p t o δ l i k p t o δ l i i 1 3 where k p t o and b p t o are the pto stiffness and damping coefficients control parameters respectively and 6 c p t o m w m b g 3 cos α is the force that counteracts the hydrostatic force in an undisturbed position and α is the tether angle relative to the vertical it is assumed that all pto machineries have the same stiffness and damping coefficients 3 2 3 hard stop forces as each pto system has a limited stroke an additional force from the hard stop mechanism is exerted on the body to constrain its motion as a result the hard stop system is modelled by a repulsive energy potential babarit et al 2011 7 f h s i k h s min δ l i δ l min u δ l min δ l i k h s max δ l i δ l max u δ l

in tether a linear superposition of the pto and hard stop forces governs the tension in each tether in addition the tethers should be always under tension in order to transmit forces to the machinery 8 f t i min 0 f p t o i f h s i i 1 3 noting that f p t o i f h s i and f t i are the forces that act along the mooring line i the generalised tether force in the cartesian coordinate frame is 9 f t e

al 1950 babarit et al 2011 10 f v i s c 1 2 ρ c d a d v b v f v b v f 1 2 ρ b q d 4 d θ θ where v b r is the buoy velocity v f is the fluid particle velocity at the position of the centre of mass of

12 b q b y z 0 0 0 b x z 0 0 0 b x y is the matrix of quadratic angular damping coefficients d is the buoy diameter and θ is the vector of angular velocities of the buoy 3 3 time domain model the buoy

is a retardation function the wave drift forces and ocean current effects are not considered in the model 3 4 frequency domain equation 13 can be linearised assuming small angular motion of the system and mapping the change in the tether length to the cartesian coordinates of the body thus the linearised frequency domain model of the generic point absorber can be written as babarit et al 2011 where

absorption energy can be generated by the pto machinery only when the tether attached to it is under tension as a result the total instantaneous power absorbed by the wec is calculated as 19 p σ t i 1 3 p i t i 1 3 f t i t δ l i t if f t i 0 3 6 model implementation hydrodynamic coefficients of the wec in the frequency domain have been obtained using an analytical solution jiang et al 2014 and verified against wamit lee 1995 see fig 4 in order to conduct the time domain simulations equation 13 has been implemented in simulink matlab with a time step of 0 01 s using the ode45 solver the duration of all simulation runs has been set to 300 t p but not less than 1200 s and the first 15 t p have not been included in the analysis due to initial transient states the convolution integral in equation 13 has been replaced by a state space model using the marine system simulator toolbox perez and fossen 2009 the irregular wave time series have been implemented using the pierson moskowitz wave spectrum the specialist committee on waves 2002 over the grid of significant wave heights of h s 0 5 7 5 m and peak wave periods t p 3 17 sec in all simulations waves propagate along the x axis making the first tether aligned with the direction of the incident wave drag coefficients have been taken from hoerner 1965 and set to c x c y 1 c z 1 1 and b x z b y z 0 2 the hard stop spring coefficient is set to k h s min k h s max 10 8 n m the pto control parameters k p t o b p t o are simultaneously optimised for each sea state using simulink design optimization toolbox with an objective function to maximise the mean value of the generated power over the duration of the simulation max k p t o b p t o p σ t the model of the single tether wec is adapted from babarit et al 2011 and will not be repeated in this paper all simulation parameters are consistent with the three tether case except the pto control settings which are optimised separately for the single tether system optimal values of the pto control parameters for the single and three tether wecs are shown in fig 5 these pto settings are used to generate results in section 4 4 comparison of performance between single and three tether buoys the main distinctive features of the three tether wec are demonstrated in this section including motion amplitudes acting forces and power output 4 1 buoy motion 4 1 1 resonance frequency in the absence of a power take off and mooring systems the natural frequency of neutrally buoyant submerged wecs approaches zero due to the absence of the hydrostatic stiffness in all degrees of freedom dof for submerged buoys the mooring lines and the pto system provide the only stiffness to the plant which controls its resonance behaviour and mode shapes the conventional motion modes such as surge heave or pitch become coupled not only hydrodynamically but also through the tether arrangement which is indicated by the presence of the off diagonal terms in the k p t o matrix see equation 18 the behaviour of such coupled multi dof systems can be investigated using eigenvectors and eigenvalues adapted from vibration analysis for details see ding et al 2017 as a result resonance frequencies of the wec described by equation 14 can be found solving the eigenvalue problem 20 m a 1 k p t o ω 0 2 i 0 where i is the identity matrix for the single tether wec the exact solution of equation 20 in heave is 21 ω 0 h e a v e k p t o m b a 33 ω 0 while for surge pitch coupled modes the expressions are more complex however by drawing an analogy of the bottom referenced heaving buoy with an inverted pendulum the resonance frequency of a single tether buoy in surge pitch can be approximated by 22 ω 0 s u r g e g m w m b l 0 m b a 11 ω 0 thus while the resonance of the single tether wec in heave can be controlled by changing the pto stiffness k p t o the buoy behaviour in surge is only dependant on such parameters as the mass ratio m b m w and the initial tether length l 0 in contrast the pto configuration of the three tether wec allows the control of both heave and surge due to the additional coupling through inclined mooring lines to demonstrate the effect of the resonance frequency on the wec s performance the response amplitude operators raos of the single and three tether converters with fixed control parameters k p t o 10 5 n m and b p t o 10 5 n m s are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively dashed lines correspond to exact solutions of equation 20 for each wec it is clear from the plots that none of these mooring configurations can effectively control angular rotation of the buoy which is evident from very large pitch amplitudes at higher frequencies however pitch motion of the single tether wec has two resonance peaks due to the undamped coupling with surge while there is only one peak for the three tether case also the latter configuration demonstrates effective coupling of heave and surge leading to the same degenerate resonance frequency 4 1 2 motion envelope due to the fact that the surge motion of the single tether wec cannot be controlled by the pto machinery the buoy may experience large displacements in the horizontal direction depending on the sea state conditions moreover the nominal operation position of such wecs can vary with time due the presence of ocean currents and wave drift forces in the case of the three tether wec the buoy motion is constrained and controlled in all translational degrees of freedom and the motion envelope of the structure is governed by the maximum stroke lengths and the tether inclination angle for the demonstration purposes motion envelopes of the single tether and three tether wecs in irregular waves of h s 3 m and t p 14 sec are shown in fig 8 data is represented in terms of the frequency of the buoy position occurrence over 4200 s the white borders outline the area in the x z plane where the buoy can operate without reaching hard stop mechanisms as expected the three tether wec motion has a circular nature due to the arrangements of mooring lines while the single tether converter swings a lot in surge similar to the inverted pendulum mechanism there is another criterion commonly used to analyse the motion of the surface buoys and vessels which is called watch circle steele et al 2009 it indicates the area diameter on the water surface within which the moored structure can move a similar performance related measure has been introduced for the comparison of various wecs that participated in the recent wave energy prize competition arranged by the u s department of energy 2016 thus the statistical peak not the maximum value of the mooring watch circle has been calculated based on the major axis of the watch circle as fully submerged wecs operate under water all the time it is possible to assume that the watch circle is the area in the horizontal plane formed by the buoy motion in surge and sway in our study the statistical peak refers to the 99 confidence level of the buoy displacement in surge a comparison between statistical peaks of the mooring watch circle for the single and three tether wecs over the range of sea states is demonstrated in fig 9 for both tether configurations the buoy displacement in surge increases with the wave height and the peak wave period however for the single tether case the mooring watch circle can reach up to 10 m in energetic sea states while for the three tether wec the motion is constrained within the 4 5 m circle 4 1 3 pitch the angular motion of both single and three tether wecs in pitch cannot be directly controlled by the pto system but it affects the total performance of the wec through coupled dynamics also if significant pitching occurs the buoy may experience surface wave breaking and undesired additional loads on the system the comparison of the statistical peak values of the pitch angle of the single and three tether wecs are shown in fig 10 as a result angular rotation of the three tether buoy remains less than 30 deg even for waves with high amplitudes while pitch angle of the single tether wec can reach 44 deg however these peak values represent mostly extreme operational conditions for each system while the significant pitch angle calculated as the root mean square over the time series shows that the angular rotation of both converters will be less than 10 deg on average 4 2 mooring system one of the biggest differences between single and three tether configurations is a mooring system design first of all the footprint of the multi mooring wec may reach 100 m in diameter in 50 m water depth while the single point mooring is limited by the dimensions of its anchorage this fact can be regarded as a drawback of the three tether system causing difficulties for the wec installation due to the uneven surface of the seabed however in the long term perspective wave energy converters will operate in groups forming wave energy farms babarit 2013 and the three tether buoys have a potential to share mooring points with adjacent devices gaudin et al 2017 as shown in fig 11 another distinctive feature of the mooring systems is the direction of the cyclic loading applied from the buoy the taut moored systems with a single line should withstand large vertical forces and a common type of the mooring arrangement for such systems is a gravity anchor or a piled foundation harris et al 2004 for the three tether wec the mooring system experiences inclined loading with a lower magnitude as the total acting force is distributed between three mooring points moreover the resistance of a pile to inclined loading is much higher as compared to the vertical loading of the same amplitude herduin et al 2016 therefore each pile for the three tether configuration is potentially smaller in diameter and in length than that for the single tether wec for comparison peak tether forces experienced by the single and three tether wecs are demonstrated in fig 12 as a result loading on each mooring point from the three tether wec is half that of the single tether device however wave tank experiments should be conducted in order to identify extreme not statistical peak forces acting on the structure rafiee et al 2016 4 3 end hard stop and tether slackness each wec should be equipped with an end stop mechanism in order to keep the buoy motion within desired boundaries the behaviour of the hard stop system is governed by equation 7 as shown in fig 8 displacements of the three tether converter are constrained more as compared to the single tether wec which leads to the greater chance of hitting end stop limits the occurrence of the hard stop events for both converters is demonstrated in fig 13 as a result for significant wave heights less than 2 5 m motion of buoys stays within set boundaries however for higher waves impact events occur twice as often for the three tether wec than for the heaving buoy this situation is not desirable for the wave converter and can be avoided using longer strokes or advanced control algorithms hals et al 2011 for example increasing the pto damping or detuning the wec under high sea states another situation that should be considered with caution is a slackness of tethers due to the positive buoyancy of the submerged converters tethers should be under tension all the time in order to effectively transmit the buoy motion in waves into the translational or rotational motion of the pto system however mooring lines can become slack because of the large wave excitation forces or additional forces exerted from the hard stop mechanisms when the tether become loose and then re tighten the wec experiences high snapping loads which may cause damage to the pto and mooring systems as can be seen from fig 14 the three tether converters are more exposed to such events due to the lower initial tension in each tether so the mass to buoyancy ratio of the three tether wec should be chosen in such a way as to provide a required pre tension force in all mooring lines 4 4 power output the power output of both converters has been analysed in terms of the peak to average ratio the contribution of individual pto systems and different motion modes to the averaged absorbed power 4 4 1 power matrix the averaged absorbed power and also statistical peak power for the single tether and three tether wecs are shown in fig 15 where control parameters have been optimised for each sea state the power output of the wec attached to three tethers is approximately two times higher than that of the single tether device across all sea states for example at the wave climate with h s 2 m and t p 9 s the power output of the converter with multiple mooring lines reaches 82 kw while the same buoy with a single tether shows 41 kw of absorbed power however this factor of 2 is a feature of the particular buoy geometry considered in this study for other shapes and aspect ratios the increase in power production can be in the range of 1 6 2 5 times sergiienko et al 2016b the level of instantaneous power for both converters is approximately 6 10 times higher than the mean power value meaning that the designed capacity of the pto should be an order of magnitude higher than the expected average energy output 4 4 2 power per pto system as stated the power take off for the three tether wec can be implemented in several ways for the case of individual pto units for each mooring line they make different contribution to the total power output the tether arrangement shown in fig 3 demonstrates only one extreme case when tether 1 is aligned with the direction of wave propagation for this configuration the pto attached to tether 1 generates approximately 45 of the total mean power for the most sea states as shown on fig 16 a the other two ptos convert the rest of the energy with an equal share due to the symmetrical arrangement of the tethers arrangement with respect to y axis thus depending on the wave direction statistics the first pto system may be designed to be larger than the other two another extreme situation is when one of tethers operates perpendicular to the wave front with almost zero power output however according to the preliminary results in frequency domain sergiienko et al 2016a the total power output of the wec is largely unaffected by wave direction relative to the arrangement of the mooring lines the comparison of power absorption between both converters is demonstrated in fig 16b showing that the three tether wec can generate approximately 1 8 2 2 times more power than its single tether counterpart to explain the main reason why the improvement is only twofold and not three times as derived in newman 1976 the budal diagram as cited in falnes and hals 2012 for the single and three tether wecs is shown in fig 17 a assuming optimal control at each wave period the blue area on the plot corresponds to the radiation limit where buoy displacements are not constrained and power production is only governed by the mode of oscillation as a result the maximum increase in the wec efficiency can be up to three times if both heave and surge contribute to the power take off the red area in fig 17a shows the range of wave periods where the buoy displacements reach constraints and power absorption limits depend on the buoy shape and maximum allowed displacements the q factor in fig 17b corresponds to the increase of the power production for a three tether case when compared with its single tether counterpart thus its values vary between 1 85 and 2 7 depending on the wave period as the irregular waves are composed from the number of waves with different frequencies the overall effect of having three tethers quality factor is averaged to the level of 2 2 2 as shown in fig 16 4 4 3 power per mode since the main idea of the application of three mooring lines is to capture power from the buoy motion in surge it is important to show how much energy is converted from each motion mode the power contribution from one mode is calculated as the difference between excitation power radiated power and viscous losses 23 p m o d e p e x c p r a d p v i s where p denotes the time average power the relative contribution from surge heave and pitch modes is shown in fig 18 for the range of sea states as expected for the single tether wec the heave motion provides around 90 95 of the total power while the remaining 5 are produced by surge interestingly the buoy oscillations in pitch have a negative impact on the power production which is indicated by the bars placed above 1 on the plot this loss is presumably due to extremely poor coupling between pitch motion of the buoy and the pto so useful work is minimal whereas losses due to radiation and drag remain high in contrast in the three tether configuration pitch has a negligible effect on the wec performance in terms of the absorbed power in general slightly more than half of the energy 50 55 is generated from the heave while the remaining 45 50 are produced from surge the contribution from surge decreases by several percent with an increasing wave height interestingly the three tether wec demonstrates slightly higher by 5 efficiency of the heave mode as compared to the single tether device which is indicated by the numbers on bars this may be caused by the different arrangements of motion envelopes as shown in fig 8 5 system sensitivity in this section the sensitivity of the power output to changes of some geometric parameters is investigated for the three tether wec for the yeu site 5 1 buoy mass the mass ratio of the buoy plays an important role in the design of the bottom referenced wec as it governs the loading on the mooring system affecting dimensions of the foundation and therefore the total cost of the converter thus the sensitivity of the power output to the mass of the three tether wec is demonstrated in fig 19 a control parameters have been optimised for each mass ratio presented as a result more energy can be generated using lighter buoy hulls while the variation in mass by 40 from the default value of m b m w 0 5 results in 10 5 change in power absorption however such relatively small gain 5 in the averaged power is also associated with a significant increase in loading on the mooring system by 1 4 times 5 2 tether stroke the length of the tether stroke governs the motion envelope of the converter and the frequency of contacting end stop mechanisms an influence of the tether stroke length on the power absorption abilities of the three tether wec is shown in fig 19a control parameters have been optimised for each value of the tether stroke over the range of sea states it is interesting to note that a change in the stroke by several metres corresponds to a marginal increase in the averaged power only 2 however it significantly affects the frequency of the end stop events and the value of 8 m 4 m seems to be the most appropriate for the current buoy design however the choice of the maximum tether stroke is generally governed not by the operational sea states but by the extreme wave conditions and requires further investigation using more accurate numerical or experimental methods rafiee and fiévez 2015 another approach is to employ control algorithms that keep displacements of the buoy within pre set boundary values without engagement with end stops hals et al 2011 5 3 tether angle the spatial arrangement of tethers is determined by i their inclination angle to the vertical and ii the anchor point of each tether to the buoy hull in this work it is assumed that all tethers point towards the geometric centre of the buoy as shown in fig 20 a such configuration minimises an influence of the power take off system on the angular motion of the wec however when the mooring lines are attached at the larger radius as shown in fig 20b the kinematic coupling between the angular motion of the buoy and change in the tether length increases the performance of the three tether wec has been analysed with a range of tether angles α 40 50 and the tether anchor point angles α a p 30 65 with optimal pto settings for each sea state the sensitivity of the mean absorbed power to the tether arrangement is shown in fig 19c where the black dot corresponds to the maximum power output at the yeu site black contour lines show 95 and 99 confidence intervals and the dashed line demonstrates the case when α a p α it can be seen from the plot that it is not necessary to have all tethers point towards the geometric centre of the buoy and a slight offset of the anchor point to a larger radius on the buoy hull increases power generation of the three tether wec thus the angles that maximise the absorbed power are α 45 and α a p 51 however the change of both angles by 5 from its optimal value will only result in 5 reduction in power 6 modelling uncertainties the numerical modelling of the wec in this study is associated with a number of assumptions including i hydrodynamic parameters are obtained using linear wave theory ii viscous drag coefficients are taken from published literature iii control parameters are optimised for each sea state uncertainties associated with the first assumption can be quantified only conducting an experimental study or using numerical results from the computational fluid dynamics simulations rafiee and valizadeh 2017 while the last two can be evaluated by varying the default value of a particular parameter 6 1 viscous losses the averaged absorbed power of the three tether wec has been calculated for the range of viscous drag coefficients and presented in fig 21 the horizontal axis corresponds to the change of the drag coefficients relative to its nominal default value used in this study thus the matrices c d and b q from equations 11 and 12 have been multiplied by the corresponding scale factor control parameters have been optimised for each value of the drag coefficient as a result uncertainties of 50 associated with a modelling of viscous losses result in power production uncertainties of 16 11 6 2 control in this work it has been assumed that the pto systems have a linear behaviour and control parameters have been optimised for each sea state in order to quantify uncertainties associated with this the performance of the wec has been evaluated using different sets of pto parameters and presented in fig 22 as a result uncertainties associated with the implementation of control are 22 0 the overall uncertainty caused by the modelling assumptions is 27 11 however for the wec at such a low development stage it is more common to assume errors within 40 40 7 economic assessment in this section two different approaches are used to assess the practicality of the three tether wec 7 1 cost breakdown and scaling to the three tether wec whilst there is an increase in the power production from the three tether wec there is also an increase in the total capital cost of the converter due to the additional power take off machinery and mooring systems thus using the cost breakdown of the submerged heaving buoy each individual component should be scaled accordingly to the 3 tether wec leading to the total capital cost scaling factor despite the fact that wave companies are reluctant to share detailed information associated with a breakdown of costs there is a number of publications which can be used as a basis for capital expenditure capex breakdown of the wave energy converters the data is summarised in table 2 specifying the source of information date of publication and the prototype considered for the cases where the levelised cost of electricity lcoe has been presented including capex and opex operating expenditure the components of capex have been isolated and their contribution re calculated in order to match the items in table 2 despite the fact that capex models presented in table 2 vary significantly the relative efficiency of the three tether wec is calculated assuming that each cost breakdown represents the single tether case the following steps are undertaken in order to estimate how the cost of the three tether wec differs from the single tether device due to the additional power take off mechanisms and mooring points i apply a capex model ii scale each item for the three tether wec according to table 3 scaling factors are chosen such that in the most unfavourable case the cost of pto foundation and its installation are tripled while the grid connection has a factor of 2 due to the doubling of the power output iii calculate the total capital cost economic scaling factor iv estimate the relative efficiency of the three tether converter as a ratio between the power production gain and the associated increase in the wec cost the resultant data for the three tether wec using each capex model are added to the bottom of table 2 three out of six models bedard et al 2005 neary et al 2014 show that the three tether wec is more beneficial from the economic point of view as compared to its single tether counterpart another two teillant et al 2012 paredes et al 2013 demonstrate that there is only a marginal advantage of having multiple mooring lines when using the conservative scaling factor in table 3 according to the cost breakdown presented by carbon trust entec uk ltd 2006 it seems unprofitable to invest in the three tether wecs this negative result is associated with a fairly large proportion of the pto system 49 in the total cost of the converter a simple calculation shows that if the power take off and mooring systems and their installation make up more than half the total cost of the wec with one tether then the three tether converter would become uneconomical to manufacture as the capex breakdown models that are publicly available differ greatly from case to case from country to country and also depending on the number of wecs involved in the farm it is very difficult to draw a definitive conclusion on the three tether wec however it is important to note that even with very conservative scaling factors the three tether wec appears to outperform the single tether wec 7 2 cost related metrics data in table 2 clearly show that there is a lot of unknowns and uncertainties associated with the financial side of the wave energy production therefore to simplify the analysis of any wec it has been suggested to use several cost related metrics babarit et al 2012 arguing that the significant mass or wetted surface can indirectly represent the total cost of the wec these parameters take into account the buoy hull and the foundation for the wec installation the most important criteria are i relative capture width hydrodynamic efficiency ii annual energy output per significant mass iii annual energy output per significant wetted surface iv annual energy output per significant tether force following a similar approach and assuming that the three tether and the single tether converters have piled foundations the comparison of performance measures is demonstrated in table 4 furthermore other parameters specific for the taut moored wecs such as the end stop impact events and also slack tether events have been added to the analysis in order to calculate the significant mass and wetted surface it has been assumed that the single tether wec has the same foundation as the ceto 5 system according to images found in carnegie wave energy limited 2013 the parameters of the pile used for ceto 5 are length is 20 m diameter is 2 m and the wall thickness is approximately 0 15 m taking these dimensions as a reference and assuming that piles are manufactured from steel the mass of foundation for the single tether wec can be estimated to be around 150 t and the surface area to be 125 m2 leading to the total significant mass of 420 t and the total wetted surface of around 505 m2 as stated in section 4 2 piles for the three tether wec should be smaller per unit force due to the distributed loading between three mooring points thus it is assumed that the mass and wetted surface of each pile for the multi tether system is half of those manufactured for ceto 5 therefore the significant mass of the three tether wec is assumed to be 496 t and the total wetted surface is 569 m3 according to data presented in table 4 the only drawback associated with the three tether wec is the frequency of the end stop impact events and chances of slack tethers this issue may be addressed extending the tether stroke as shown in section 5 2 and applying advanced control strategies in order to keep the motion of the buoy within desired boundaries other techno economic metrics indicate that the three tether wec has a potential to double the power output as well as to produce cheaper electricity as compared to the same buoy with a single tether configuration 7 3 ace another complex metric called average climate capture width per characteristic capital expenditure ace has been offered recently for assessing wecs at a low technology readiness level u s department of energy 2016 characteristic capital expenditure can be calculated using the following formula characteristic capital expenditure total surface area m 2 structural thickness m material density kg m 3 cost of material kg in de andres et al 2016 the ace index is calculated for the range of wecs using the price of steel as 0 615 kg and the density of steel as 7900 kg m3 in order to be consistent with de andres et al 2016 and to make a comparison of the three tether device with other wec prototypes the same values are used in this paper taking data from table 4 ace can be calculated as a c e 1 t e t h e r 3 12 m 420 10 3 kg 0 615 kg 12 08 m m a c e 3 t e t h e r 6 24 m 496 10 3 kg 0 615 kg 20 46 m m as ace is correlated with the performance index annual power output per significant mass the higher ace is obtained for the three tether wec moreover the comparison of this metric has been performed for the range of converters refer to de andres et al 2016 and it appears that the three tether wec demonstrates the second best ace out of 9 wecs included in the study in de andres et al 2016 8 conclusion the performance of the submerged three tether wec has been analysed in irregular waves using the state of the art methods the submerged three tether wec has a potential to absorb twice as much power as the submerged heaving buoy while reducing load on the mooring system due to the additional constraints from the multi tether configuration the buoy experiences much less displacement in the horizontal direction moreover surge is effectively coupled to the power take off system and contributes the same amount of power as heave the economic assessment also demonstrated that despite doubling the power the three tether wec can produce cheaper electricity as compared to the same buoy with a single tether configuration acknowledgement this research has been supported by the australian government research training program
