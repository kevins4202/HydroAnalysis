15075,environmental pollution of antibiotic resistance genes args has been a great public concern integrons as mobile genetic elements with versatile gene acquisition systems facilitate the horizontal gene transfer hgt and pollution disseminations of args however little is understood about the characteristics of args mediated by integrons which hampers our monitoring and control of the mobile antimicrobial resistance risks to address these issues we reviewed 3 322 publications concerning detection methods and pipeline arg diversity and evolutionary progress environmental and geographical distribution bacterial hosts gene cassettes arrangements and based on which to identify args with high risk levels mediated by integrons diverse args of 516 subtypes attributed to 12 types were capable of being carried by integrons with 62 core arg subtypes prevalent in pollution source natural and human related environments hosts of arg carrying integrons reached 271 bacterial species most frequently carried by opportunistic pathogens escherichia coli pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae moreover the observed emergence of args together with their multiple arrangements indicated the accumulation of args mediated by integrons and thus pose increasing hgt risks under modern selective agents with the concerns of public health we urgently call for a better monitoring and control of these high risk args our identified risk rank i args aaca7 blaoxa10 catb3 catb8 dfra5 with high mobility reviewed key trends and noteworthy advancements and proposed future directions could be reference and guidance for standard formulation graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords integron antibiotic resistance gene horizontal gene transfer bacterial host risk ranking data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics are widely used for human therapy and livestock breeding the majority of which are excreted unchanged into the environment this accelerated the development of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and further exacerbated through horizontal gene transfer hgt by mobile genetic elements mges gillings et al 2015 under the increasing severe situation and with public health concerns antimicrobial resistance is thus considered as an emerging environmental pollutant and becomes a major global pollution issue unep 2017 who 2020 integrons are mges that play a major role in the global dissemination of args and even genes conferring resistance to metals and disinfectants such as qaceδ1 conferring resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds qacs because they can capture and express exogenous genes from a vast pool of resistance genes and could be resident on diverse mobile elements for rapid transfer among diverse species gillings 2018 zhao et al 2015 meanwhile the prosperity of arg integron system was facilitated by anthropogenic activities that at least 1023 copies of integrons are daily releasing into natural environments via waste streams worldwide zhu et al 2017 as emerging environmental pollutants and vectors of args to the environment integron activity is mediated by integrase gene inti and two recombination sites exogenous gene cassettes usually consist of a single open reading frame orf bounded by a cassette associated recombination site attc the inti plays an important role in catalyzing the insertion of gene cassettes by site specific recombination between attc and integron recombination site atti this process is reversible so that gene cassettes integrated in integrons can be excised as free circular gene cassettes after the insertion of gene cassette it was expressed by the integron promoter pc ghaly et al 2020 gillings 2014 inti mediates the insertion excision and rearrangement of gene cassettes that multiple args could accumulate within the platform to form a gene cassette array allows integrons to generate genomic and phenotypic diversity the arg carrying integrons could be further assembled to transposons and plasmids gillings et al 2015 facilitating their hgt among host cells integrons are widespread in diverse environments including wastewater ma et al 2017 soil sen et al 2011 sediment ghaderpour et al 2015 river gillings et al 2009 ocean moura et al 2014 and even pristine niches e g deep terrestrial subsurface and isolated caves brown and balkwill 2009 the release of treated wastewater with relatively high abundance of integrons into rivers accumulated the integrons in natural waters and sediments and the application of sludge onto agricultural land may also facilitate the dissemination of integrons and associated args czekalski et al 2014 among diverse classes of integrons class 1 integrons have been most frequently reported to carry diverse args and also in strong correlation with other pollution compounds that integrase inti1 was proposed as a proxy for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 till now at least 130 args have been found carried by integrons partridge et al 2009 which could be captured by wide range of bacterial species and residue in diverse environments for instance dfra1 aada1 was found carried by integrons of escherichia coli isolated from hospital poey and lavina 2018 salmonella typhimurium isolated from food ahmed et al 2014 and klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from river ozgumus et al 2009 etc in recent decade with great public concerns increasing studies were carried out on args carried by integrons and constantly reported novel args carrying gcs args gcs and their bacterial hosts under modern selective agents of antibiotics gillings 2018 metals oliveira pinto et al 2016 and disinfectants michael et al 2016 however little is understood about the characteristics of args mediated by integrons i e arg diversity multiple combinations evolutionary progress bacterial hosts environmental and geographic distribution which are key for understanding the severe situation of antimicrobial resistance and further for monitoring and management of mobile args mediated by integrons to fill in the research gaps and enhance our knowledge on development and health risks of antimicrobial resistance this review aims to 1 survey args and their combinations carried by integrons and delineate the development progress 2 clarify bacterial hosts of arg carrying integrons and depict environmental distribution 3 systematically summarize research methods and pipeline and further to 4 provide novel perspective on antimicrobial resistance control data from peer reviewed papers and relevant database related to arg carrying integrons published by the end of december 2021 were collected and summarized see detailed flowchart in fig 1 and section 2 in total we analyzed 3322 relevant publications and collected 8136 items of carrier information on arg carrying integrons 2 search strategy and information selection search strategy to conduct a comprehensive survey of antibiotic resistance genes args types carried by integrons and further explore their environmental distribution bacterial hosts and evolutionary process we searched literatures by using keywords of integron combined with antibiotic resistance gene from web of science core collection database and collected 3067 relevant literatures in total fig 1 in addition the widely used integron database integrall moura et al 2009 was reviewed then 11 462 information items of cassette arrays were collected and 255 literatures were supplemented information selection each of the collected 3322 literatures from web of science core collection and integrall was manually checked to identify whether it covers the information of arg carrying integrons resulting in a final of 1556 literatures n retained after filtration referring to 1 arg carrying integrons n 1448 2 without the above information but covering correlations between integrases and specific args n 138 and 3 55 review papers on integrons for reference consequently 8136 arg carrying gene cassette information 7217 from web of science core collection and 919 from integrall were obtained and summarized for downstream analysis information record and analysis each information item included if available the class of integron arg s carried bacterial host environmental ecotype country region and year of sample collection if not mentioned the publication year was recorded moreover the detection pipeline and methods of gene cassettes carried by integrons for each study were summarized to synthesize the practical approaches for efficient monitoring and identification of args carried by integrons as reference for related studies and future advances all the articles complied for this systematic review have been catalogued in a zotero library accessible at https www zotero org groups 4663334 3 methods and pipelines for detection of args carried by integrons 3 1 research pipelines knowledge of pipelines for detecting args carried by integrons benefits our further studies on mobile args mediated by integrons and assessment of their potential risks for control of args dissemination based on all the 3322 research articles on arg carrying integons the research pipelines were summarized in fig 2 to date the detection of args carried by integrons mainly applied traditional molecular based methods generally after sample preparation and dna extraction pcr method was used for amplifying gene cassettes gcs of integrons carried by isolates kwiecien et al 2020 or from total environmental dna marathe et al 2019 and then followed by sequencing first second or third generation for targeting diverse gc fragments with different lengths and sequencing depths subsequently annotation with referenced public arg or integrated database was conducted to further identify arg gc sequences in addition researchers identified integrons and associated arg gcs carried on plasmid genomes and bacterial whole draft genomes from experiments generated szczepanowski et al 2005 or from public databases zhang et al 2018 for improving the knowledge of the diversity and bacterial hosts of args carried and hgt mediated by integrons the development of detection pipelines meets our increasing demands of the identification of integron mediated args and the multiple pipelines could facilitate more accurate or high throughput detections for isolates or mixed microbial communities with different research focuses especially the advances of metagenomics which broke through the limitations of traditional culture based detection 3 2 dna extraction dna extraction was conducted for obtaining genomic information of isolates and environmental samples for amplification of integrase and gcs or for meta genomic sequencing with the development of biological techniques in recent years nearly all the publications applied extraction kits for total isolates plasmid dna extraction for studies on integrons kits of fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals che et al 2019 e z n a soil dna kit omega he et al 2019 and powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories wang et al 2017c were most frequently used for total dna extraction from diverse environmental samples while plasmid midi kit qiagen li et al 2018 and axyprep plasmid miniprep kit axygen wang et al 2017a were most frequently used for plasmid dna extraction in addition the boiling lysis liu et al 2020 and alkaline lysis pornsukarom and thakur 2017 methods can be used for dna extraction of both isolates and plasmids the quality of extracted dna is key for our identification of integrases and gcs especially long thus determining the concentration and purity is necessary mainly conducted by using spectrophotometer fluorometer and gel electrophoresis 3 3 detection of args carried by integrons 3 3 1 amplification of integrases gcs and associated genes pcr amplifications are carried out for detection of integrases e g inti1 inti2 inti3 for identification of integrons carried by isolates or quantification of integrons for total dnas as well as gene cassettes of integrons variable regions and associated genes e g qaceδ1 and sul1 a pair of primers targeting qaceδ1 sul1 798 bp was frequently used for amplifying 3 cs of class 1 integrons singh et al 2021 all these primers used in the literature were summarized in table s1 with most frequently used primers listed in table 1 furthermore degenerate primers such as inti r 5 gcg aac gar tgb cgv agv gtgtg 3 hs286 5 ggg atc ctc sgc tkg arc gam ttg tta gvc 3 which could amplify approximately 800 bp of the integron integrase gene as well as downstream gene cassettes ghaly et al 2022 are of biological and ecological significance that the first cassettes in the arrays could be identified which are the most recently inserted cassettes and are likely to be strongly expressed collis and hall 1995 moreover long range pcr with optimized reaction conditions enabled an amplification of long gcs 5 kb or covering partial integrase and qaceδ1 sul1 with high fidelity dna polymerase amos et al 2018 zhao et al 2012 in addition traditional primers have their limitation of identifying atypical class 1 integrons which were mediated with insertion sequences such as is26 and iscr1 thus specific primers such as primer set 5 ggc atc caa gca ag 3 5 cgc atc acc tca ata cct t 3 for integron is26 elements amplification or whole genome sequencing were used for the detection of atypical class 1 integron gene cassettes dawes et al 2010 reid et al 2017 different amplification strategies were conducted for identification of diverse gcs of integrons and these summarized primers facilitate our identification of args carried by integrons of bacterial isolates and diverse environments 3 3 2 high throughput detection of args carried by integrons args carried by integrons could transfer more frequently among bacteria via hgt which largely motivates researchers to identify these diverse args and their multiple arrangements ma et al 2017 many studies identified arg carrying integrons based on the pcr amplification for specific isolates han et al 2016 sun et al 2016 yu et al 2016 with the advantages of known bacterial hosts but with relatively low throughput furthermore ta cloning based on the pcr products of gcs diaz et al 2006 du et al 2005 michael et al 2005 szczepanowski et al 2004 together with functional metagenome che et al 2019 ma et al 2016 facilitated our higher throughput identification of args carried by integrons in recent years with the development of high throughput sequencing techniques the metagenomic analysis combined with pcr amplification of gcs greatly improved the throughput of detection ma et al 2017 in addition based on the bioinformatics analysis the available bacterial whole genomes and draft genomes were scanned for comprehensive profile of integrons and associated gcs zhang et al 2018 these largely promoted our knowledge of args carried by integrons together with their bacterial hosts and environmental niches the first second and third generation sequencing techniques facilitated our different views of arg carrying integrons from isolates and environmental samples sanger sequencing is used for sequencing relatively long length 1000 bp but in low throughput feasible for identification of single gc amplified from isolates the second and third generation sequencing are suitable for sequencing from total environmental dna while comparatively the former generates relatively shorter sequences 100 250 bp with assembly required but in higher precision and lower cost and the significantly long sequences generated by the latter could be corrected using short reads generated by the second generation sequencing to identify long gcs of integrons facilitating a comprehensive profile of args carried by integrons kamathewatta et al 2019 kubota et al 2019 marathe et al 2019 3 3 3 databases for identification of integrases args and associated genes various gc sequences of integrons could be generated by using different experimental and sequencing strategies and the accurate identification of args and associated functional genes is essential for exploration of args patterns carried by integrons the annotation was mainly based on comparison with the referenced databases in recent years arg databases sarg yang et al 2016 card alcock et al 2020 deeparg arango argoty et al 2018 resfinder zankari et al 2012 and ardb liu and pop 2009 were mainly used for rapid screening of args gcs subsequently those identified args gcs were further annotated by comparing with integrated databases for identification of all open reading frames orfs carried such as ncbi genbank hossain et al 2019 noh et al 2019 wyrsch et al 2019 and non redundant protein nr database gillings et al 2009 marathe et al 2019 2018 in addition for identification of integron carried by genomes integron related databases e g integrall moura et al 2009 acid joss et al 2009 could provide online annotation service for single sequence and also could be downloaded for batch comparisons via local workstation and the annotation pipeline i vip zhang et al 2018 was developed for annotation and classification of integrons on complete draft genomes or assembled metagenomes and args they carried these integron arg and integrated databases make it possible for researchers from diverse fields to identify args carrying integrons and their gene arrangements and further explore their bacterial hosts health risks and environmental prevalence 4 results and discussion 4 1 profiles of args carried by integrons a comprehensive profile of args carried on the gene cassettes gcs of integrons allows our overview of integron driven mobile args which are in high risk of extensive dissemination over a wide range of bacterial hosts and thus pose threats to public health after search and screening workflow of literature and information a total of 1703 articles were identified to report specific args carried by integrons from which we recorded a total of 12 arg types and 516 arg subtypes as gc arrays of integrons fig 3 a this largely refreshed the present knowledge of 132 diverse args reported to be carried by integrons gillings 2018 among all the detected 12 arg types aminoglycoside args were the most diverse args to be captured by integrons 192 subtypes accounting for 37 2 followed by beta lactam args 174 subtypes 33 7 and trimethoprim args 60 subtypes 11 6 these major arg types aminoglycoside beta lactam and trimethoprim were most frequently observed in wastewater treatment plants wwtps an et al 2018 which accept the excreta and sewage of humans and have the possibility to pollute the natural environments via daily discharge of treated water barraud et al reported clinical isolates were more resistant to antibiotics of aminoglycosides and beta lactams via a survey of 100 gram negative isolates randomly isolated from hospital barraud and ploy 2015 thus the potential hgt of these args and the encoded antimicrobial resistance warrant both of the environmental and clinical concerns integrons exhibit a progressive ability of capturing accumulating more diverse and multiple xenogenetic args over the past 40 years fig 3b the observed 516 arg subtypes constituting a total of 1881 diverse arrangements of args gc arrays 77 3 of which carried 2 args with up to 8 args as multiple gc arrays carried by the same integron those diverse arrangements of args gc arrays were mainly carried by class 1 integrons gc 1784 followed by class 2 integrons gc 98 and class 3 integrons gc 21 fig s4b notably arg carrying integrons most frequently carried two args 36 1 rather than just one 22 7 for the two identified integrons that carried 8 args one dfra1 qaceδ1 cmlb blaveb1 aadb arr2 cmla1 blaoxa10 aada1a qaceδ1 was found carried by an acinetobacter baumannii strain isolated from hospital in france liu et al 2014 encoding multi resistance to aminoglycoside beta lactam chloramphenicol rifamycin and trimethoprim and the other qacl aadb aaca1 orfg blaveb1 aadb arr2 cmla5 blaoxa10 aada was found carried by e coli isolated from a clinical sample in france naas et al 2001 encoding multi resistance to aminoglycoside beta lactam chloramphenicol and rifamycin the observed significant multiple args and combinations carried by integrons refresh and improve our knowledge on the args dissemination driven by integrons although not all the gcs of integrons could be successfully expressed by pc promoter collis and hall 1995 these carried args still pose high hgt risks and also arg gcs could be excised for rearrangements under antibiotic selective pressure for expression barraud and ploy 2015 integrons versatile gene acquisition systems facilitate their capturing and accumulating diverse args and thus enable their bacterial hosts to be resistant to multiple antibiotics and survive under selective pressure of antibiotics heavy metals and disinfectants han et al 2019 hubeny et al 2021 furthermore based on the comprehensive profiles of args carried by integrons to explore the development history is essential to our understanding of their evolutionary progress for precaution and developing control strategy 4 2 potential development progress of args carried by integrons the evolution and development of integrons are kept going on along with the time driven by the constant exposure to selective agents in both human dominated and natural environments gillings 2018 with the results that they continue to capture and accumulate args to confer advantageous phenotype the discovered args carried by integrons along with time indicated by types and subtypes was delineated in fig 4 a and fig s1 early in 1981 dfrb2 was first reported embed into gc of integrons carried by e coli isolates zolg and hanggi 1981 followed by another arg dfra1 reported in 1983 that was carried by e coli isolates fling and richards 1983 and both of the isolates were found resistant to trimethoprim subsequently an aminoglycoside arg aada was found carried by integrons in 1985 hollingshead and vapnek 1985 followed by another aminoglycoside arg aadb reported in 1986 cameron et al 1986 till 1988 an integron carrying more than one arg blaoxa10 aadb aada10 was discovered from pseudomonas aeruginosa huovinen et al 1988 encoding multi resistance to aminoglycoside and beta lactam subsequently in 1991 a combination of args blaveb1 aadb arr2 cmla encoding resistance to multiple antibiotics aminoglycoside beta lactam chloramphenicol and rifamycin was identified from pseudomonas aeruginosa bissonnette et al 1991 since then every 1 6 years researchers reported args encoding resistance to new antibiotic type resulting the emergence of args captured by integrons followed the time sequence of tri ami bel chl rif mls sul lin fos qui tet mac fig 4a the latest reported multi resistance arrangement with 5 arg types ami bel chl sul tri was detected in 2020 from k pneumoniae dfra12 arr2 cmla1 blaoxa10 aada isolated from poultry in china zhang et al 2020 for the most diverse arg type carried by integrons the aminoglycosides were for extensive usage since 1960s and then after the first discovery of aminoglycoside arg carried by integrons in 1985 researchers discovered new aminoglycoside args embed onto integrons every year since 1998 fig 4b tables s8 and s9 similarly though beta lactam args were discovered in 1988 relatively later comparing with aminoglycoside and trimethoprim args huovinen et al 1988 emerging beta lactam args were reported by literature nearly every year since its first observation in past five years we kept newly observing 11 19 aminoglycoside subtypes plus 5 15 beta lactam subtypes carried by integrons every year this indicated that a prosperous progress of resistance integrons is pretty staggering recent studies frequently reported that antibiotic selective pressures may lead to the accumulation and diversity of args zhao et al 2019 and aminoglycosides and beta lactams are major antibiotic classes applied in human therapy and livestock breeding takahashi and igarashi 2018 that may continuously pose the selective pressures on the emergence of aminoglycoside and beta lactam args captured by integrons though the discovery of newly reported args carried by integrons may be partially parsed by the present research studies and multiple methods the increasing patterns could somehow reflect the potential evolutionary progress which warrants more attentions and researches on 4 3 environmental and geographical distribution 4 3 1 environmental distribution these summarized arg carrying integrons were observed from diverse environments covering a total of 12 environmental niches fig s2a for further analysis and tracing persistent args we classified these observation environments into three groups including pollution sources ps covering hospitals farms and fishery wastewater treatment plants and human feces natural environments ne covering natural water soils sediments and plants and human related environments he covering food landscape water drinking water source and tap water all our observed 12 arg types occurred in ps environment without macrolide and fosfomycin args in ne and he environments respectively fig 5 a moreover a total of 429 arg subtypes were observed in ps while only 118 and 113 arg subtypes were detected in ne and he environments respectively those source associated environments hospitals farms fishery feces and wastewater treatment plants had been considered as the hotspots of args jacobs and chenia 2007 stalder et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 which may contribute to the high diversity and hgt frequency of arg carrying integrons among them 296 23 and 13 arg subtypes were specifically in ps ne and he environments respectively for example blaoxa was found specifically in ps detected from hospital rajpara et al 2018 from shigella flexneri wwtps araujo et al 2021 and farms zhao et al 2020 from s typhimurium an aminoglycoside arg aada1di was only observed in ne from soils martini et al 2018 from microbacterium oxydans aac8 was found in he from food o mahony et al 2006 from s typhimurium significantly 62 arg subtypes 12 0 of total detected subtypes attributed to 8 arg types were persistent in diverse environments as core integron carrying args fig 5b among them 20 core integron carrying args accounting for 32 belonged to aminoglycoside type followed by trimethoprim n 16 beta lactam n 10 and chloramphenicol n 7 aada2 encoding resistance to aminoglycoside was the earliest emerged core integron carrying arg that it was first observed from patients in 1994 lambert et al 1994 and subsequently investigated from river water rosser and young 1999 and human food schnabel and jones 1999 dfra1 one of the trimethoprim resistance genes was first observed from e coli klebsiella oxytoca and serratia marcescens isolated from patients martinez freijo et al 1999 and swines sunde and sorum 1999 in 1999 and then detected in natural and human associated environments in 2002 mammina et al 2002 thungapathra et al 2002 sul3 encoding resistance to sulfonamide was the latest core integron carrying arg to be detected and to be prevalent in pe ne and he environments in 2014 moura et al 2014 with the environmental and public health concerns we should pay more efforts on monitoring those shared arg subtypes and prevent aggravation of their hgt in diverse environments and also the potential dissemination of specific arg subtypes especially from pollution source environments 4 3 2 geographical distribution the summarized arg carrying integrons were prevalent in 95 countries regions and 7 continents including asia europe africa north america south america oceania and antarctica the most diverse integron associated arg subtypes were found in asia diversity d 305 attributed to 12 arg types followed by europe d 222 9 arg types and the north america d 93 6 arg types further for the arrangement diversity there are 819 582 and 147 diverse arg gc arrays detected in asia europe and the north america accounting for 43 5 30 9 and 7 8 of the total gc arrays diversity respectively similarly a report of global antibiotic consumption indicated the highest antibiotic usage was estimated in eastern europe and central asia by bayesian geostatistical model browne et al 2021 and li et al reported that the antibiotic selective pressures could promote the mobile args mediated by mges li et al 2022 thus the regulation of antibiotic use is key to control of arg dissemination among these detected integron associated args 5 subtypes of aminoglycoside args aada aada2 aada4 and aada5 and trimethoprim arg dfra17 were significantly observed from all the 7 continents considered as global args that prevalent on integrons moreover a cmla1 carrying integron was even detected from pseudomonas sp isolated from sediments near tiksi coast of laptev sea in arctic ocean petrova et al 2011 with almost no human footprints the prevalence of specific arg carrying integrons indicated the integron associated antimicrobial resistance issue is a global health concern rather than an issue restricted to a specific region country continent 4 4 bacterial hosts of arg carrying integons 4 4 1 profiles of bacterial hosts the transfer of integrons onto broad host range plasmids drives their diversification and allows spread by conjugation to new bacterial species gillings 2017 till now 72 bacterial species the majority of which are of medical importance had been reported to carry arg carrying integrons domingues et al 2015 here we totally summarized 7430 host isolates of arg carrying integrons attributed to 271 bacterial species 79 genera and 5 phyla fig 6 a for the detected species 256 81 and 94 species were isolated from ps ne and he environments respectively furthermore after comparing against the published pathogen list of human pathogenic species woolhouse et al 2015 a total of 88 potential pathogenic species were identified with 66 31 and 28 potential pathogenic species observed in ps ne and he environments respectively the highest diversity of arg integron pathogenic species was observed in ps environment which may be promoted by the relatively high selective pressures of various antibiotics in the pollution sources e g hospital farms wwtps however the research preferences e g interested environments priority pathogens and detection methods may cause biases to the data collection among the annotated potential pathogenic species e coli was the most frequently reported to carry arg carrying integrons in all the environments followed by p aeruginosa and k pneumoniae fig 6a deserving further observation of their resistome patterns of integrons with great human and environmental health concerns 4 4 2 major bacterial hosts e coli e coli is a gram negative facultative anaerobic rod shaped coliform bacterium of the genus escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm blooded organisms and as indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination tenaillon et al 2010 information of 2252 e coli isolates which carried args carrying integrons were totally collected from the literature covering diverse environments ps 1849 ne 169 he 234 these observed args carried by integrons of e coli isolates belonged to 10 arg types and 160 arg subtypes with aminoglycoside and trimethoprim args most frequently carried with averagely 84 2 and 68 2 respectively but tetracycline args the least and only in pollution sources 0 1 of isolates fig 6b table 4 among the 62 core integron carrying args identified in section 4 3 1 there observed a total of 25 core integron carrying args carried by e coli stains isolated from pollution source natural and human related environments table 2 encoding resistance to 7 antibiotics of ami n 11 tri n 9 chl n 3 bel n 1 mls n 1 sul n 1 among them aada and dfra1 were the dominant core integron carrying args carried by e coli with average frequency of 39 9 and 40 4 respectively especially in human related environments e g food jiang et al 2019 and drinking water source ribeiro et al 2012 39 8 and 48 8 of e coli strains carrying arg carrying integrons were observed as carriers of aada1 and dfra1 respectively fig s5a although e coli is opportunistic pathogen that most e coli strains are harmless it s as key repository of mobile args may aggravate the prosperity of arb args and ar pathogens thus the studies on integron mediated arg transfer should keep consistent monitoring the development of arg carrying integrons carried by e coli and based on which to develop nichetargeting control strategies pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa is a common encapsulated gram negative facultatively aerobic rod shaped bacterium that can cause disease in plants animals and humans diggle and whiteley 2020 of the literature based collected 645 p aeruginosa isolates carried arg carrying integrons ps 521 ne 6 he 1 a total of 9 arg types and 202 arg subtypes were detected carried by integrons of p aeruginosa with aminoglycoside args averagely 96 7 and beta lactam args averagely 43 1 most frequently carried fig 6b differently with e coli strains p aeruginosa carried extremely high diverse beta lactam args of 84 subtypes accounting for 48 2 of beta lactam args reported to be carried by integrons up to the date table 3 this indicated that p aeruginosa trended to carry beta lactam args as their main bacterial hosts and contributed their horizontal transfer among diverse bacterial hosts furthermore among all the carried args aaca4 and blavim2 were most frequently detected in arg carrying integrons of p aeruginosa with averagely 22 3 and 21 1 respectively fig s5b although we observed a higher frequency of aaca4 in natural environments and of blavim2 in pollution sources the comparisons may suffer biases caused by uneven available isolates number for statistics p aeruginosa had been considered as a multidrug resistant pathogen recognized for its ubiquity and its intrinsically advanced antibiotic resistance mechanisms diggle and whiteley 2020 together with our reviewed large numbers of p aeruginosa isolates carrying diverse arg carrying integrons and their associated health concerns largely motivate us to appeal for more studies on profiles of p aeruginosa strains especially from natural and human related environments to further assess their potential health impacts klebsiella pneumoniae k pneumoniae is a gram negative non motile encapsulated lactose fermenting facultative anaerobic and rod shaped bacterium li et al 2014 the opportunistic pathogens may cause bronchopneumonia and also bronchitis and even develop to lung abscess and empyema of the literature based collected 564 k pneumoniae isolates that carried arg carrying integrons ps 392 ne 23 he 17 a total of 10 arg types and 128 arg subtypes were detected carried by integrons of k pneumoniae with aminoglycoside args averagely 79 1 trimethoprim args averagely 55 1 and beta lactam args averagely 20 6 most frequently carried and prevalent in pollution source natural and human related environments fig 6b subtypes of aada aada2 dfra12 and dfra17 were found frequently carried by arg carrying integrons of k pneumoniae isolates fig s5c with averagely 25 7 28 3 19 4 25 6 respectively under selective pressures k pneumoniae could continuously accumulate args by de novo mutations and via acquisition of mobile genetic elements leading to extremely drug resistant strains harboring a super resistome that emerged showing superior ability to cause multicontinent outbreaks and continuous global dissemination moreover k pneumoniae was considered as worldwide source and shuttle for antibiotic resistance and as key role in disseminating antimicrobial resistance genes from environmental microbes to clinically important pathogens tenaillon et al 2010 wyres and holt 2018 thus because of health concerns studies on mobile args carried by integrons of k pneumoniae should not be limited to the clinical but more expanded to diverse environments for tracing its evolution mechanisms of arg prosperity and transfer and based on which to design targeted precaution and treatment 4 4 3 broad spectrum bacterial hosts of core args our identified core args were found to be carried by diverse bacterial hosts significantly 29 arg subtypes 46 8 of core integron carrying args attributed to 8 arg types were detected from 30 bacterial species from diverse environments considered as broad spectrum bacterial hosts of core args and even core integron carrying args of aada aada2 dfra1 dfra12 aaca4 dfra17 and aada5 were reported to be carried by 74 bacterial species among them aada encoding resistance to aminoglycoside was significantly carried by 167 bacterial species attributed to 4 phyla including proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and actinobacteria isolated from diverse environments of farms kadlec and

aeruginosa c 37 a baumannii c 34 and s typhimurium c 30 were the most common hosts of core integron carrying args table s6 the broad spectrum bacterial hosts and medium fluidity of diverse environments largely facilitate the transfer and prosperity of core args mediated by integrons from pollution source to natural and human related environments imposing potential risks to human health associated with the hgt among bacterial and environmental mobility the air pollution zhu et al 2021 global water cycling khan et al 2020 and even human activities e g people travel di et al 2018 sea fishing chen et al 2022 could also promote the diverse and abundant arg carrying integrons in global environments the catalog of core args and their broad spectrum bacterial hosts could provide reference for the monitoring index for preventing the dissemination of args mediated by integrons 4 5 gene arrangements of args carried by integrons 4 5 1 overall gene arrangements of arg gcs further insights into arrangements of arg carrying integrons and a comprehensive profile facilitate our overview of mobile args mediated by integrons and their development progress and associated health risks as reference for antimicrobial resistance control since aadb aada was first discovered in 1986 cameron et al 1986 multiple args carried by gene cassettes trends to accumulate along with the time indicating the prosperous evolution of arg integrons fig 3b we observed a total of 1881 diverse arrangements of arg gcs comprised of 516 diverse arg subtypes carried by integrons these arg carrying integrons carried 1 13 genes 1 8 of which are args fig 7 a integrons carrying 2 args were the most common among all the arrangements n 679 accounting for 36 1 followed by carrying 3 args 26 4 and 1 arg 22 7 significantly 4 9 of integrons carried 5 args identified as super antibiotic resistance integrons saris we observed more multiple args 2 args carried by integrons of bacteria from pollution source environments while higher percentage of saris 6 3 was discovered in human related environments but with the least in natural environments 3 4 fig 7b warranting more public health concerns 4 5 2 persistent and core arg gcs fifty eight arg gc arrangements with 1 5 args were prevalent and shared from pollution source to natural and human related environments 57 of which carried multiple args fig 7c those persistent and core arg gcs may greatly contribute to the aggravation of antimicrobial resistance in environments and further to clarify their bacterial hosts vectors is necessary for management and control among them dfra1b aada1b canal et al 2016 jones dias et al 2016 mbelle et al 2019 was found specifically carried by e coli isolates and the other 57 core arg gc arrangements 98 were carried by 2 bacterial species indicating their broad range of bacterial hosts facilitating their prevalence in diverse environments most significantly gc of adda had been reported to be carried by a total of 74 bacterial species attributed to 26 genera and 3 phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria for the multiple args gcs dfra12 orf aada2 was carried by the broadest range of bacterial hosts with a total of 67 bacterial species attributed to 28 genera and 4 phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria followed by dfra1 aada1 dfra17 aada5 dfra1 sat1 aada1 and dfra12 aada2 which were carried by 10 bacterial species notably phylum proteobacteria carried all the core arg gc arrays with 4 args table s4 covering arrays of aaca4cr arr3 dfra27 aada16 liu et al 2015 su et al 2012 wei et al 2013 xia et al 2013 aadb cat blaoxa10 aada1 cao et al 2017 di et al 2018 han et al 2012 and dfra16 blapse1 aada2 cmla1 aada1 lei et al 2018 lin et al 2015 oprea et al 2020 xiao et al 2019 indicating its robust ability of capturing args and conducting disseminations via integrons all of them were detected after 2011 e g dfra16 blapse1 aada2 cmla1 aada1 was first discovered in 2015 from jiulong river in southern china carried by acinetobacter sp lin et al 2015 and successively detected carried by proteus mirabilis strains isolated from swine in 2018 lei et al 2018 food xiao et al 2019 and hospital xiao et al 2019 in 2019 the prevalent arg combinations carried by integrons were largely facilitated by their broad range bacterial hosts and evolutionary with greater potential health risks this warrants more studies on their source transportation fate and evolutionary progress for preventing the further aggravation of antimicrobial resistance 4 5 3 gc arrangements of main integron species for the most dominant bacterial hosts of arg carrying integrons e coli we observed a total of 437 arg gcs arrangements with diversity of 160 subtypes attributed to 10 types they carried with 6 integrons carrying multiple arg subtypes of 5 fig 7d the most multiple one naas et al 2001 carried a total of 10 genes as gcs 8 of which were args encoding resistance to aminoglycoside aadb aaca1 aada beta lactam blaveb1 and blaoxa10 chloramphenicol cmla5 and rifamycin arr2 it is observed that aminoglycoside beta lactam and chloramphenicol args frequently comprised gcs of super typical class 1 integrons of e coli isolates while dfra16 and aada2 cmla1 aada qach were frequently carried by super atypical class 1 integrons fig s6 indicating e coli strains easily capture these multiple args on integrons and conduct multi resistance to diverse antibiotics or disinfectants fewer super arg carrying integrons were found carried by k pneumoniae n 5 5 args fig 7d with aaca4 and catb3 frequently carried while only one super arg carrying integron was carried by p aeruginosa with 5 args blavim2 qacf aaca7 catb3 blaoxa1 aada1 encoding resistance to aminoglycoside beta lactam and chloramphenicol fig 7d significantly this class 1 integron was only detected carried by p aeruginosa which may be the main vectors in the environment furthermore these super arg carrying integrons carried by k pneumoniae and p aeruginosa were all detected from clinical strains isolated from hospital cendejas et al 2010 lazaro perona et al 2018 wang et al 2017b and all of them carried aminoglycoside and chloramphenicol resistance genes therefore these dominant bacterial hosts pose risks of multiple resistance to microbial communities in environments via versatile gene acquisition systems of integrons 4 6 risk ranking of mobile args carried by integrons along with the development history we observed an increasing arg diversity and their multiple combinations of integrons this facilitates bacterial hosts to survive under selective pressure of antibiotics and even horizontal transfer among diverse species although large diversity of args n 516 have been reported to be carried by integrons their potential health and environmental risk levels are in different degrees considering their discrepancy of presence in environmental niches and their broad bacterial hosts thus the risk ranking of these diverse mobile args is necessary as reference and guidance for our monitoring and control of antimicrobial resistance disseminations here proposed a risk framework based on the assessment of two criteria 1 observed environments and 2 bacterial hosts which yields four categories risk rank i ii iii iv indicating different risk levels of mobile args mediated by integrons fig 8 risk rank i situates the highest risks whose args have been reported in diverse environments and were carried by 30 bacterial species and 50 of which were pathogens as a result there were 5 args aaca7 blaoxa10 catb3 catb8 dfra5 assigned to risk rank i encoding resistance to 4 antibiotic types including aminoglycoside beta lactam chloramphenicol and trimethoprim the risk of args carried by integrons was attributed to their mobility indicated by their hgt frequency and broad spectrum hosts though all the 516 arg subtypes should be covered for consideration for hgt risks those 5 args attributed to risk rank i with high mobility and broad spectrum bacterial hosts should be paid more attention for alleviating antimicrobial resistance mediated by integrons 4 7 perspectives and current knowledge gaps generally accepted that integrons and args they mediated propel the prosperity of antimicrobial resistance among diverse bacterial hosts and environmental niches gillings 2018 gillings et al 2015 our comprehensive summary and novel insights into the diversity bacterial hosts and environmental habitats of args could improve our knowledge on risks of antimicrobial resistance mediated by integrons for further contribution to future promotion of monitoring prediction and control strategies comprehensive survey and database integrity with the increasing studies reporting args carrying integrons it is required to keep integrating these information for improving our understanding of evolutionary progress of args mediated by integrons under the modern application of antibiotics in therapy and livestock breeding except for the temporal accumulations of args captured by integrons according to literature based time series observations the spatial shifts considering complex environmental factors are also necessary for evolutionary studies but still insufficient based on the spatial temporal development mechanisms of args mediated by integrons a more comprehensive database covering types of integrons args environments and bacterial hosts with optimized annotation pipeline could be developed and optimized to facilitate studies on mobile args with global health risks concerns furthermore based on these information models of evolutionary progress and transportation fates could be built up for prediction of the development of args mediated by integrons as important reference and guidance for future monitoring control and management of the antimicrobial resistance promoted by integrons optimization of detection methods multiple optional methods could facilitate the identification and quantification of integrons and args they carried with the pcr amplification of gcs from microbial mixture combined with ta cloning cheng et al 2019 li et al 2017 yu et al 2016 or direct metagenomic sequences che et al 2019 ma et al 2017 2016 could disclose diverse arg gcs of integrons and associated risks and thus primers design and optimization yang et al 2021 for amplification of more diverse and precise variable regions of integrons is key for improving knowledge furthermore with the increasing requirement of profiling args from complex environmental samples high throughput sequencing for total dnas or pcr products are being more frequently used kamathewatta et al 2019 ma et al 2017 marathe et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 mainly 1 integrases e g inti1 inti2 inti3 could be extracted from the metagenomic data and normalized to a single copy housekeeping gene for quantification in comparable with qpcr detection 2 multiple arg carried integrons could be annotated from assembled long metagenomic sequences from samples with diverse microbiome or from whole draft microbial genomes with the strengths of dna sequencing in high efficiency and decreasing costs more efforts could be paid for developing analysis strategies using metagenomic sequences to broaden our knowledge on arg diversity and combinations carried by integrons as well as their diverse bacterial hosts and specific habitats control strategies first antibiotic selective pressures have been verified to increase or maintain the occurrence of intergons and promote the horizontal transfer of args among species in environments barraud and ploy 2015 chainier et al 2017 lacotte et al 2017 with the purpose of decreasing the associated risk level a comprehensive identification of key selective agents e g antibiotics heavy metals disinfectants and based on which to develop removal strategies are necessary for efficiently restraining the prosperity of antimicrobial resistance mediated by integrons next till now there has been no standard for args arb and mges in discharged water or diverse environments due to their high diversity making the human and ecological health risks difficult to be systematically evaluated while developing risk assessment especially for those typical mobile args e g 5 args attributed to risk rank i and bacterial species such as e coli p aeruginosa and k pneumoniae that frequently join horizontal transfers could be emphatically focused as key nodes and indicators for standard formulation and based on which to develop comprehensive risk assessment systems for control and management of antimicrobial resistance 5 conclusion in summary our critical review fills in the research gaps of a comprehensive profile of args carried by integrons with hgt risks covering 1 detection methods and pipeline 2 arg diversity and evolutionary progress 3 environmental and geographical distribution 4 bacterial hosts 5 gene cassettes arrangements and based on which to 6 identify args with different risk levels mediated by integrons and propose future perspectives the roadmap of achieving investigation advances and control of args dissemination mediated by integrons is still on its long way but the understanding of integrons and associated mobile args warrants great efforts to step further otherwise years or decades from now the increasing diversity and multiple args that are captured by integrons could be tremendous and even dominate the prosperity of antimicrobial resistance and reach the situation of out of control with more deaths due to failure of antibiotics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

15075,environmental pollution of antibiotic resistance genes args has been a great public concern integrons as mobile genetic elements with versatile gene acquisition systems facilitate the horizontal gene transfer hgt and pollution disseminations of args however little is understood about the characteristics of args mediated by integrons which hampers our monitoring and control of the mobile antimicrobial resistance risks to address these issues we reviewed 3 322 publications concerning detection methods and pipeline arg diversity and evolutionary progress environmental and geographical distribution bacterial hosts gene cassettes arrangements and based on which to identify args with high risk levels mediated by integrons diverse args of 516 subtypes attributed to 12 types were capable of being carried by integrons with 62 core arg subtypes prevalent in pollution source natural and human related environments hosts of arg carrying integrons reached 271 bacterial species most frequently carried by opportunistic pathogens escherichia coli pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae moreover the observed emergence of args together with their multiple arrangements indicated the accumulation of args mediated by integrons and thus pose increasing hgt risks under modern selective agents with the concerns of public health we urgently call for a better monitoring and control of these high risk args our identified risk rank i args aaca7 blaoxa10 catb3 catb8 dfra5 with high mobility reviewed key trends and noteworthy advancements and proposed future directions could be reference and guidance for standard formulation graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords integron antibiotic resistance gene horizontal gene transfer bacterial host risk ranking data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics are widely used for human therapy and livestock breeding the majority of which are excreted unchanged into the environment this accelerated the development of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and further exacerbated through horizontal gene transfer hgt by mobile genetic elements mges gillings et al 2015 under the increasing severe situation and with public health concerns antimicrobial resistance is thus considered as an emerging environmental pollutant and becomes a major global pollution issue unep 2017 who 2020 integrons are mges that play a major role in the global dissemination of args and even genes conferring resistance to metals and disinfectants such as qaceδ1 conferring resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds qacs because they can capture and express exogenous genes from a vast pool of resistance genes and could be resident on diverse mobile elements for rapid transfer among diverse species gillings 2018 zhao et al 2015 meanwhile the prosperity of arg integron system was facilitated by anthropogenic activities that at least 1023 copies of integrons are daily releasing into natural environments via waste streams worldwide zhu et al 2017 as emerging environmental pollutants and vectors of args to the environment integron activity is mediated by integrase gene inti and two recombination sites exogenous gene cassettes usually consist of a single open reading frame orf bounded by a cassette associated recombination site attc the inti plays an important role in catalyzing the insertion of gene cassettes by site specific recombination between attc and integron recombination site atti this process is reversible so that gene cassettes integrated in integrons can be excised as free circular gene cassettes after the insertion of gene cassette it was expressed by the integron promoter pc ghaly et al 2020 gillings 2014 inti mediates the insertion excision and rearrangement of gene cassettes that multiple args could accumulate within the platform to form a gene cassette array allows integrons to generate genomic and phenotypic diversity the arg carrying integrons could be further assembled to transposons and plasmids gillings et al 2015 facilitating their hgt among host cells integrons are widespread in diverse environments including wastewater ma et al 2017 soil sen et al 2011 sediment ghaderpour et al 2015 river gillings et al 2009 ocean moura et al 2014 and even pristine niches e g deep terrestrial subsurface and isolated caves brown and balkwill 2009 the release of treated wastewater with relatively high abundance of integrons into rivers accumulated the integrons in natural waters and sediments and the application of sludge onto agricultural land may also facilitate the dissemination of integrons and associated args czekalski et al 2014 among diverse classes of integrons class 1 integrons have been most frequently reported to carry diverse args and also in strong correlation with other pollution compounds that integrase inti1 was proposed as a proxy for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 till now at least 130 args have been found carried by integrons partridge et al 2009 which could be captured by wide range of bacterial species and residue in diverse environments for instance dfra1 aada1 was found carried by integrons of escherichia coli isolated from hospital poey and lavina 2018 salmonella typhimurium isolated from food ahmed et al 2014 and klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from river ozgumus et al 2009 etc in recent decade with great public concerns increasing studies were carried out on args carried by integrons and constantly reported novel args carrying gcs args gcs and their bacterial hosts under modern selective agents of antibiotics gillings 2018 metals oliveira pinto et al 2016 and disinfectants michael et al 2016 however little is understood about the characteristics of args mediated by integrons i e arg diversity multiple combinations evolutionary progress bacterial hosts environmental and geographic distribution which are key for understanding the severe situation of antimicrobial resistance and further for monitoring and management of mobile args mediated by integrons to fill in the research gaps and enhance our knowledge on development and health risks of antimicrobial resistance this review aims to 1 survey args and their combinations carried by integrons and delineate the development progress 2 clarify bacterial hosts of arg carrying integrons and depict environmental distribution 3 systematically summarize research methods and pipeline and further to 4 provide novel perspective on antimicrobial resistance control data from peer reviewed papers and relevant database related to arg carrying integrons published by the end of december 2021 were collected and summarized see detailed flowchart in fig 1 and section 2 in total we analyzed 3322 relevant publications and collected 8136 items of carrier information on arg carrying integrons 2 search strategy and information selection search strategy to conduct a comprehensive survey of antibiotic resistance genes args types carried by integrons and further explore their environmental distribution bacterial hosts and evolutionary process we searched literatures by using keywords of integron combined with antibiotic resistance gene from web of science core collection database and collected 3067 relevant literatures in total fig 1 in addition the widely used integron database integrall moura et al 2009 was reviewed then 11 462 information items of cassette arrays were collected and 255 literatures were supplemented information selection each of the collected 3322 literatures from web of science core collection and integrall was manually checked to identify whether it covers the information of arg carrying integrons resulting in a final of 1556 literatures n retained after filtration referring to 1 arg carrying integrons n 1448 2 without the above information but covering correlations between integrases and specific args n 138 and 3 55 review papers on integrons for reference consequently 8136 arg carrying gene cassette information 7217 from web of science core collection and 919 from integrall were obtained and summarized for downstream analysis information record and analysis each information item included if available the class of integron arg s carried bacterial host environmental ecotype country region and year of sample collection if not mentioned the publication year was recorded moreover the detection pipeline and methods of gene cassettes carried by integrons for each study were summarized to synthesize the practical approaches for efficient monitoring and identification of args carried by integrons as reference for related studies and future advances all the articles complied for this systematic review have been catalogued in a zotero library accessible at https www zotero org groups 4663334 3 methods and pipelines for detection of args carried by integrons 3 1 research pipelines knowledge of pipelines for detecting args carried by integrons benefits our further studies on mobile args mediated by integrons and assessment of their potential risks for control of args dissemination based on all the 3322 research articles on arg carrying integons the research pipelines were summarized in fig 2 to date the detection of args carried by integrons mainly applied traditional molecular based methods generally after sample preparation and dna extraction pcr method was used for amplifying gene cassettes gcs of integrons carried by isolates kwiecien et al 2020 or from total environmental dna marathe et al 2019 and then followed by sequencing first second or third generation for targeting diverse gc fragments with different lengths and sequencing depths subsequently annotation with referenced public arg or integrated database was conducted to further identify arg gc sequences in addition researchers identified integrons and associated arg gcs carried on plasmid genomes and bacterial whole draft genomes from experiments generated szczepanowski et al 2005 or from public databases zhang et al 2018 for improving the knowledge of the diversity and bacterial hosts of args carried and hgt mediated by integrons the development of detection pipelines meets our increasing demands of the identification of integron mediated args and the multiple pipelines could facilitate more accurate or high throughput detections for isolates or mixed microbial communities with different research focuses especially the advances of metagenomics which broke through the limitations of traditional culture based detection 3 2 dna extraction dna extraction was conducted for obtaining genomic information of isolates and environmental samples for amplification of integrase and gcs or for meta genomic sequencing with the development of biological techniques in recent years nearly all the publications applied extraction kits for total isolates plasmid dna extraction for studies on integrons kits of fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals che et al 2019 e z n a soil dna kit omega he et al 2019 and powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories wang et al 2017c were most frequently used for total dna extraction from diverse environmental samples while plasmid midi kit qiagen li et al 2018 and axyprep plasmid miniprep kit axygen wang et al 2017a were most frequently used for plasmid dna extraction in addition the boiling lysis liu et al 2020 and alkaline lysis pornsukarom and thakur 2017 methods can be used for dna extraction of both isolates and plasmids the quality of extracted dna is key for our identification of integrases and gcs especially long thus determining the concentration and purity is necessary mainly conducted by using spectrophotometer fluorometer and gel electrophoresis 3 3 detection of args carried by integrons 3 3 1 amplification of integrases gcs and associated genes pcr amplifications are carried out for detection of integrases e g inti1 inti2 inti3 for identification of integrons carried by isolates or quantification of integrons for total dnas as well as gene cassettes of integrons variable regions and associated genes e g qaceδ1 and sul1 a pair of primers targeting qaceδ1 sul1 798 bp was frequently used for amplifying 3 cs of class 1 integrons singh et al 2021 all these primers used in the literature were summarized in table s1 with most frequently used primers listed in table 1 furthermore degenerate primers such as inti r 5 gcg aac gar tgb cgv agv gtgtg 3 hs286 5 ggg atc ctc sgc tkg arc gam ttg tta gvc 3 which could amplify approximately 800 bp of the integron integrase gene as well as downstream gene cassettes ghaly et al 2022 are of biological and ecological significance that the first cassettes in the arrays could be identified which are the most recently inserted cassettes and are likely to be strongly expressed collis and hall 1995 moreover long range pcr with optimized reaction conditions enabled an amplification of long gcs 5 kb or covering partial integrase and qaceδ1 sul1 with high fidelity dna polymerase amos et al 2018 zhao et al 2012 in addition traditional primers have their limitation of identifying atypical class 1 integrons which were mediated with insertion sequences such as is26 and iscr1 thus specific primers such as primer set 5 ggc atc caa gca ag 3 5 cgc atc acc tca ata cct t 3 for integron is26 elements amplification or whole genome sequencing were used for the detection of atypical class 1 integron gene cassettes dawes et al 2010 reid et al 2017 different amplification strategies were conducted for identification of diverse gcs of integrons and these summarized primers facilitate our identification of args carried by integrons of bacterial isolates and diverse environments 3 3 2 high throughput detection of args carried by integrons args carried by integrons could transfer more frequently among bacteria via hgt which largely motivates researchers to identify these diverse args and their multiple arrangements ma et al 2017 many studies identified arg carrying integrons based on the pcr amplification for specific isolates han et al 2016 sun et al 2016 yu et al 2016 with the advantages of known bacterial hosts but with relatively low throughput furthermore ta cloning based on the pcr products of gcs diaz et al 2006 du et al 2005 michael et al 2005 szczepanowski et al 2004 together with functional metagenome che et al 2019 ma et al 2016 facilitated our higher throughput identification of args carried by integrons in recent years with the development of high throughput sequencing techniques the metagenomic analysis combined with pcr amplification of gcs greatly improved the throughput of detection ma et al 2017 in addition based on the bioinformatics analysis the available bacterial whole genomes and draft genomes were scanned for comprehensive profile of integrons and associated gcs zhang et al 2018 these largely promoted our knowledge of args carried by integrons together with their bacterial hosts and environmental niches the first second and third generation sequencing techniques facilitated our different views of arg carrying integrons from isolates and environmental samples sanger sequencing is used for sequencing relatively long length 1000 bp but in low throughput feasible for identification of single gc amplified from isolates the second and third generation sequencing are suitable for sequencing from total environmental dna while comparatively the former generates relatively shorter sequences 100 250 bp with assembly required but in higher precision and lower cost and the significantly long sequences generated by the latter could be corrected using short reads generated by the second generation sequencing to identify long gcs of integrons facilitating a comprehensive profile of args carried by integrons kamathewatta et al 2019 kubota et al 2019 marathe et al 2019 3 3 3 databases for identification of integrases args and associated genes various gc sequences of integrons could be generated by using different experimental and sequencing strategies and the accurate identification of args and associated functional genes is essential for exploration of args patterns carried by integrons the annotation was mainly based on comparison with the referenced databases in recent years arg databases sarg yang et al 2016 card alcock et al 2020 deeparg arango argoty et al 2018 resfinder zankari et al 2012 and ardb liu and pop 2009 were mainly used for rapid screening of args gcs subsequently those identified args gcs were further annotated by comparing with integrated databases for identification of all open reading frames orfs carried such as ncbi genbank hossain et al 2019 noh et al 2019 wyrsch et al 2019 and non redundant protein nr database gillings et al 2009 marathe et al 2019 2018 in addition for identification of integron carried by genomes integron related databases e g integrall moura et al 2009 acid joss et al 2009 could provide online annotation service for single sequence and also could be downloaded for batch comparisons via local workstation and the annotation pipeline i vip zhang et al 2018 was developed for annotation and classification of integrons on complete draft genomes or assembled metagenomes and args they carried these integron arg and integrated databases make it possible for researchers from diverse fields to identify args carrying integrons and their gene arrangements and further explore their bacterial hosts health risks and environmental prevalence 4 results and discussion 4 1 profiles of args carried by integrons a comprehensive profile of args carried on the gene cassettes gcs of integrons allows our overview of integron driven mobile args which are in high risk of extensive dissemination over a wide range of bacterial hosts and thus pose threats to public health after search and screening workflow of literature and information a total of 1703 articles were identified to report specific args carried by integrons from which we recorded a total of 12 arg types and 516 arg subtypes as gc arrays of integrons fig 3 a this largely refreshed the present knowledge of 132 diverse args reported to be carried by integrons gillings 2018 among all the detected 12 arg types aminoglycoside args were the most diverse args to be captured by integrons 192 subtypes accounting for 37 2 followed by beta lactam args 174 subtypes 33 7 and trimethoprim args 60 subtypes 11 6 these major arg types aminoglycoside beta lactam and trimethoprim were most frequently observed in wastewater treatment plants wwtps an et al 2018 which accept the excreta and sewage of humans and have the possibility to pollute the natural environments via daily discharge of treated water barraud et al reported clinical isolates were more resistant to antibiotics of aminoglycosides and beta lactams via a survey of 100 gram negative isolates randomly isolated from hospital barraud and ploy 2015 thus the potential hgt of these args and the encoded antimicrobial resistance warrant both of the environmental and clinical concerns integrons exhibit a progressive ability of capturing accumulating more diverse and multiple xenogenetic args over the past 40 years fig 3b the observed 516 arg subtypes constituting a total of 1881 diverse arrangements of args gc arrays 77 3 of which carried 2 args with up to 8 args as multiple gc arrays carried by the same integron those diverse arrangements of args gc arrays were mainly carried by class 1 integrons gc 1784 followed by class 2 integrons gc 98 and class 3 integrons gc 21 fig s4b notably arg carrying integrons most frequently carried two args 36 1 rather than just one 22 7 for the two identified integrons that carried 8 args one dfra1 qaceδ1 cmlb blaveb1 aadb arr2 cmla1 blaoxa10 aada1a qaceδ1 was found carried by an acinetobacter baumannii strain isolated from hospital in france liu et al 2014 encoding multi resistance to aminoglycoside beta lactam chloramphenicol rifamycin and trimethoprim and the other qacl aadb aaca1 orfg blaveb1 aadb arr2 cmla5 blaoxa10 aada was found carried by e coli isolated from a clinical sample in france naas et al 2001 encoding multi resistance to aminoglycoside beta lactam chloramphenicol and rifamycin the observed significant multiple args and combinations carried by integrons refresh and improve our knowledge on the args dissemination driven by integrons although not all the gcs of integrons could be successfully expressed by pc promoter collis and hall 1995 these carried args still pose high hgt risks and also arg gcs could be excised for rearrangements under antibiotic selective pressure for expression barraud and ploy 2015 integrons versatile gene acquisition systems facilitate their capturing and accumulating diverse args and thus enable their bacterial hosts to be resistant to multiple antibiotics and survive under selective pressure of antibiotics heavy metals and disinfectants han et al 2019 hubeny et al 2021 furthermore based on the comprehensive profiles of args carried by integrons to explore the development history is essential to our understanding of their evolutionary progress for precaution and developing control strategy 4 2 potential development progress of args carried by integrons the evolution and development of integrons are kept going on along with the time driven by the constant exposure to selective agents in both human dominated and natural environments gillings 2018 with the results that they continue to capture and accumulate args to confer advantageous phenotype the discovered args carried by integrons along with time indicated by types and subtypes was delineated in fig 4 a and fig s1 early in 1981 dfrb2 was first reported embed into gc of integrons carried by e coli isolates zolg and hanggi 1981 followed by another arg dfra1 reported in 1983 that was carried by e coli isolates fling and richards 1983 and both of the isolates were found resistant to trimethoprim subsequently an aminoglycoside arg aada was found carried by integrons in 1985 hollingshead and vapnek 1985 followed by another aminoglycoside arg aadb reported in 1986 cameron et al 1986 till 1988 an integron carrying more than one arg blaoxa10 aadb aada10 was discovered from pseudomonas aeruginosa huovinen et al 1988 encoding multi resistance to aminoglycoside and beta lactam subsequently in 1991 a combination of args blaveb1 aadb arr2 cmla encoding resistance to multiple antibiotics aminoglycoside beta lactam chloramphenicol and rifamycin was identified from pseudomonas aeruginosa bissonnette et al 1991 since then every 1 6 years researchers reported args encoding resistance to new antibiotic type resulting the emergence of args captured by integrons followed the time sequence of tri ami bel chl rif mls sul lin fos qui tet mac fig 4a the latest reported multi resistance arrangement with 5 arg types ami bel chl sul tri was detected in 2020 from k pneumoniae dfra12 arr2 cmla1 blaoxa10 aada isolated from poultry in china zhang et al 2020 for the most diverse arg type carried by integrons the aminoglycosides were for extensive usage since 1960s and then after the first discovery of aminoglycoside arg carried by integrons in 1985 researchers discovered new aminoglycoside args embed onto integrons every year since 1998 fig 4b tables s8 and s9 similarly though beta lactam args were discovered in 1988 relatively later comparing with aminoglycoside and trimethoprim args huovinen et al 1988 emerging beta lactam args were reported by literature nearly every year since its first observation in past five years we kept newly observing 11 19 aminoglycoside subtypes plus 5 15 beta lactam subtypes carried by integrons every year this indicated that a prosperous progress of resistance integrons is pretty staggering recent studies frequently reported that antibiotic selective pressures may lead to the accumulation and diversity of args zhao et al 2019 and aminoglycosides and beta lactams are major antibiotic classes applied in human therapy and livestock breeding takahashi and igarashi 2018 that may continuously pose the selective pressures on the emergence of aminoglycoside and beta lactam args captured by integrons though the discovery of newly reported args carried by integrons may be partially parsed by the present research studies and multiple methods the increasing patterns could somehow reflect the potential evolutionary progress which warrants more attentions and researches on 4 3 environmental and geographical distribution 4 3 1 environmental distribution these summarized arg carrying integrons were observed from diverse environments covering a total of 12 environmental niches fig s2a for further analysis and tracing persistent args we classified these observation environments into three groups including pollution sources ps covering hospitals farms and fishery wastewater treatment plants and human feces natural environments ne covering natural water soils sediments and plants and human related environments he covering food landscape water drinking water source and tap water all our observed 12 arg types occurred in ps environment without macrolide and fosfomycin args in ne and he environments respectively fig 5 a moreover a total of 429 arg subtypes were observed in ps while only 118 and 113 arg subtypes were detected in ne and he environments respectively those source associated environments hospitals farms fishery feces and wastewater treatment plants had been considered as the hotspots of args jacobs and chenia 2007 stalder et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 which may contribute to the high diversity and hgt frequency of arg carrying integrons among them 296 23 and 13 arg subtypes were specifically in ps ne and he environments respectively for example blaoxa was found specifically in ps detected from hospital rajpara et al 2018 from shigella flexneri wwtps araujo et al 2021 and farms zhao et al 2020 from s typhimurium an aminoglycoside arg aada1di was only observed in ne from soils martini et al 2018 from microbacterium oxydans aac8 was found in he from food o mahony et al 2006 from s typhimurium significantly 62 arg subtypes 12 0 of total detected subtypes attributed to 8 arg types were persistent in diverse environments as core integron carrying args fig 5b among them 20 core integron carrying args accounting for 32 belonged to aminoglycoside type followed by trimethoprim n 16 beta lactam n 10 and chloramphenicol n 7 aada2 encoding resistance to aminoglycoside was the earliest emerged core integron carrying arg that it was first observed from patients in 1994 lambert et al 1994 and subsequently investigated from river water rosser and young 1999 and human food schnabel and jones 1999 dfra1 one of the trimethoprim resistance genes was first observed from e coli klebsiella oxytoca and serratia marcescens isolated from patients martinez freijo et al 1999 and swines sunde and sorum 1999 in 1999 and then detected in natural and human associated environments in 2002 mammina et al 2002 thungapathra et al 2002 sul3 encoding resistance to sulfonamide was the latest core integron carrying arg to be detected and to be prevalent in pe ne and he environments in 2014 moura et al 2014 with the environmental and public health concerns we should pay more efforts on monitoring those shared arg subtypes and prevent aggravation of their hgt in diverse environments and also the potential dissemination of specific arg subtypes especially from pollution source environments 4 3 2 geographical distribution the summarized arg carrying integrons were prevalent in 95 countries regions and 7 continents including asia europe africa north america south america oceania and antarctica the most diverse integron associated arg subtypes were found in asia diversity d 305 attributed to 12 arg types followed by europe d 222 9 arg types and the north america d 93 6 arg types further for the arrangement diversity there are 819 582 and 147 diverse arg gc arrays detected in asia europe and the north america accounting for 43 5 30 9 and 7 8 of the total gc arrays diversity respectively similarly a report of global antibiotic consumption indicated the highest antibiotic usage was estimated in eastern europe and central asia by bayesian geostatistical model browne et al 2021 and li et al reported that the antibiotic selective pressures could promote the mobile args mediated by mges li et al 2022 thus the regulation of antibiotic use is key to control of arg dissemination among these detected integron associated args 5 subtypes of aminoglycoside args aada aada2 aada4 and aada5 and trimethoprim arg dfra17 were significantly observed from all the 7 continents considered as global args that prevalent on integrons moreover a cmla1 carrying integron was even detected from pseudomonas sp isolated from sediments near tiksi coast of laptev sea in arctic ocean petrova et al 2011 with almost no human footprints the prevalence of specific arg carrying integrons indicated the integron associated antimicrobial resistance issue is a global health concern rather than an issue restricted to a specific region country continent 4 4 bacterial hosts of arg carrying integons 4 4 1 profiles of bacterial hosts the transfer of integrons onto broad host range plasmids drives their diversification and allows spread by conjugation to new bacterial species gillings 2017 till now 72 bacterial species the majority of which are of medical importance had been reported to carry arg carrying integrons domingues et al 2015 here we totally summarized 7430 host isolates of arg carrying integrons attributed to 271 bacterial species 79 genera and 5 phyla fig 6 a for the detected species 256 81 and 94 species were isolated from ps ne and he environments respectively furthermore after comparing against the published pathogen list of human pathogenic species woolhouse et al 2015 a total of 88 potential pathogenic species were identified with 66 31 and 28 potential pathogenic species observed in ps ne and he environments respectively the highest diversity of arg integron pathogenic species was observed in ps environment which may be promoted by the relatively high selective pressures of various antibiotics in the pollution sources e g hospital farms wwtps however the research preferences e g interested environments priority pathogens and detection methods may cause biases to the data collection among the annotated potential pathogenic species e coli was the most frequently reported to carry arg carrying integrons in all the environments followed by p aeruginosa and k pneumoniae fig 6a deserving further observation of their resistome patterns of integrons with great human and environmental health concerns 4 4 2 major bacterial hosts e coli e coli is a gram negative facultative anaerobic rod shaped coliform bacterium of the genus escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm blooded organisms and as indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination tenaillon et al 2010 information of 2252 e coli isolates which carried args carrying integrons were totally collected from the literature covering diverse environments ps 1849 ne 169 he 234 these observed args carried by integrons of e coli isolates belonged to 10 arg types and 160 arg subtypes with aminoglycoside and trimethoprim args most frequently carried with averagely 84 2 and 68 2 respectively but tetracycline args the least and only in pollution sources 0 1 of isolates fig 6b table 4 among the 62 core integron carrying args identified in section 4 3 1 there observed a total of 25 core integron carrying args carried by e coli stains isolated from pollution source natural and human related environments table 2 encoding resistance to 7 antibiotics of ami n 11 tri n 9 chl n 3 bel n 1 mls n 1 sul n 1 among them aada and dfra1 were the dominant core integron carrying args carried by e coli with average frequency of 39 9 and 40 4 respectively especially in human related environments e g food jiang et al 2019 and drinking water source ribeiro et al 2012 39 8 and 48 8 of e coli strains carrying arg carrying integrons were observed as carriers of aada1 and dfra1 respectively fig s5a although e coli is opportunistic pathogen that most e coli strains are harmless it s as key repository of mobile args may aggravate the prosperity of arb args and ar pathogens thus the studies on integron mediated arg transfer should keep consistent monitoring the development of arg carrying integrons carried by e coli and based on which to develop nichetargeting control strategies pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa is a common encapsulated gram negative facultatively aerobic rod shaped bacterium that can cause disease in plants animals and humans diggle and whiteley 2020 of the literature based collected 645 p aeruginosa isolates carried arg carrying integrons ps 521 ne 6 he 1 a total of 9 arg types and 202 arg subtypes were detected carried by integrons of p aeruginosa with aminoglycoside args averagely 96 7 and beta lactam args averagely 43 1 most frequently carried fig 6b differently with e coli strains p aeruginosa carried extremely high diverse beta lactam args of 84 subtypes accounting for 48 2 of beta lactam args reported to be carried by integrons up to the date table 3 this indicated that p aeruginosa trended to carry beta lactam args as their main bacterial hosts and contributed their horizontal transfer among diverse bacterial hosts furthermore among all the carried args aaca4 and blavim2 were most frequently detected in arg carrying integrons of p aeruginosa with averagely 22 3 and 21 1 respectively fig s5b although we observed a higher frequency of aaca4 in natural environments and of blavim2 in pollution sources the comparisons may suffer biases caused by uneven available isolates number for statistics p aeruginosa had been considered as a multidrug resistant pathogen recognized for its ubiquity and its intrinsically advanced antibiotic resistance mechanisms diggle and whiteley 2020 together with our reviewed large numbers of p aeruginosa isolates carrying diverse arg carrying integrons and their associated health concerns largely motivate us to appeal for more studies on profiles of p aeruginosa strains especially from natural and human related environments to further assess their potential health impacts klebsiella pneumoniae k pneumoniae is a gram negative non motile encapsulated lactose fermenting facultative anaerobic and rod shaped bacterium li et al 2014 the opportunistic pathogens may cause bronchopneumonia and also bronchitis and even develop to lung abscess and empyema of the literature based collected 564 k pneumoniae isolates that carried arg carrying integrons ps 392 ne 23 he 17 a total of 10 arg types and 128 arg subtypes were detected carried by integrons of k pneumoniae with aminoglycoside args averagely 79 1 trimethoprim args averagely 55 1 and beta lactam args averagely 20 6 most frequently carried and prevalent in pollution source natural and human related environments fig 6b subtypes of aada aada2 dfra12 and dfra17 were found frequently carried by arg carrying integrons of k pneumoniae isolates fig s5c with averagely 25 7 28 3 19 4 25 6 respectively under selective pressures k pneumoniae could continuously accumulate args by de novo mutations and via acquisition of mobile genetic elements leading to extremely drug resistant strains harboring a super resistome that emerged showing superior ability to cause multicontinent outbreaks and continuous global dissemination moreover k pneumoniae was considered as worldwide source and shuttle for antibiotic resistance and as key role in disseminating antimicrobial resistance genes from environmental microbes to clinically important pathogens tenaillon et al 2010 wyres and holt 2018 thus because of health concerns studies on mobile args carried by integrons of k pneumoniae should not be limited to the clinical but more expanded to diverse environments for tracing its evolution mechanisms of arg prosperity and transfer and based on which to design targeted precaution and treatment 4 4 3 broad spectrum bacterial hosts of core args our identified core args were found to be carried by diverse bacterial hosts significantly 29 arg subtypes 46 8 of core integron carrying args attributed to 8 arg types were detected from 30 bacterial species from diverse environments considered as broad spectrum bacterial hosts of core args and even core integron carrying args of aada aada2 dfra1 dfra12 aaca4 dfra17 and aada5 were reported to be carried by 74 bacterial species among them aada encoding resistance to aminoglycoside was significantly carried by 167 bacterial species attributed to 4 phyla including proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and actinobacteria isolated from diverse environments of farms kadlec and schwarz 2008 human feces weiss et al 2018 wwtps ben said et al 2016 ps environments natural water kotlarska et al 2015 plants xu et al 2013 sediments ghaderpour et al 2015 soils ne environments food van et al 2007 drinking water source ribeiro et al 2012 tap water ozgumus et al 2007 and landscape water carvalho et al 2012 he environments e coli core integron carrying args c 56 k pneumoniae c 50 p aeruginosa c 37 a baumannii c 34 and s typhimurium c 30 were the most common hosts of core integron carrying args table s6 the broad spectrum bacterial hosts and medium fluidity of diverse environments largely facilitate the transfer and prosperity of core args mediated by integrons from pollution source to natural and human related environments imposing potential risks to human health associated with the hgt among bacterial and environmental mobility the air pollution zhu et al 2021 global water cycling khan et al 2020 and even human activities e g people travel di et al 2018 sea fishing chen et al 2022 could also promote the diverse and abundant arg carrying integrons in global environments the catalog of core args and their broad spectrum bacterial hosts could provide reference for the monitoring index for preventing the dissemination of args mediated by integrons 4 5 gene arrangements of args carried by integrons 4 5 1 overall gene arrangements of arg gcs further insights into arrangements of arg carrying integrons and a comprehensive profile facilitate our overview of mobile args mediated by integrons and their development progress and associated health risks as reference for antimicrobial resistance control since aadb aada was first discovered in 1986 cameron et al 1986 multiple args carried by gene cassettes trends to accumulate along with the time indicating the prosperous evolution of arg integrons fig 3b we observed a total of 1881 diverse arrangements of arg gcs comprised of 516 diverse arg subtypes carried by integrons these arg carrying integrons carried 1 13 genes 1 8 of which are args fig 7 a integrons carrying 2 args were the most common among all the arrangements n 679 accounting for 36 1 followed by carrying 3 args 26 4 and 1 arg 22 7 significantly 4 9 of integrons carried 5 args identified as super antibiotic resistance integrons saris we observed more multiple args 2 args carried by integrons of bacteria from pollution source environments while higher percentage of saris 6 3 was discovered in human related environments but with the least in natural environments 3 4 fig 7b warranting more public health concerns 4 5 2 persistent and core arg gcs fifty eight arg gc arrangements with 1 5 args were prevalent and shared from pollution source to natural and human related environments 57 of which carried multiple args fig 7c those persistent and core arg gcs may greatly contribute to the aggravation of antimicrobial resistance in environments and further to clarify their bacterial hosts vectors is necessary for management and control among them dfra1b aada1b canal et al 2016 jones dias et al 2016 mbelle et al 2019 was found specifically carried by e coli isolates and the other 57 core arg gc arrangements 98 were carried by 2 bacterial species indicating their broad range of bacterial hosts facilitating their prevalence in diverse environments most significantly gc of adda had been reported to be carried by a total of 74 bacterial species attributed to 26 genera and 3 phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria for the multiple args gcs dfra12 orf aada2 was carried by the broadest range of bacterial hosts with a total of 67 bacterial species attributed to 28 genera and 4 phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria followed by dfra1 aada1 dfra17 aada5 dfra1 sat1 aada1 and dfra12 aada2 which were carried by 10 bacterial species notably phylum proteobacteria carried all the core arg gc arrays with 4 args table s4 covering arrays of aaca4cr arr3 dfra27 aada16 liu et al 2015 su et al 2012 wei et al 2013 xia et al 2013 aadb cat blaoxa10 aada1 cao et al 2017 di et al 2018 han et al 2012 and dfra16 blapse1 aada2 cmla1 aada1 lei et al 2018 lin et al 2015 oprea et al 2020 xiao et al 2019 indicating its robust ability of capturing args and conducting disseminations via integrons all of them were detected after 2011 e g dfra16 blapse1 aada2 cmla1 aada1 was first discovered in 2015 from jiulong river in southern china carried by acinetobacter sp lin et al 2015 and successively detected carried by proteus mirabilis strains isolated from swine in 2018 lei et al 2018 food xiao et al 2019 and hospital xiao et al 2019 in 2019 the prevalent arg combinations carried by integrons were largely facilitated by their broad range bacterial hosts and evolutionary with greater potential health risks this warrants more studies on their source transportation fate and evolutionary progress for preventing the further aggravation of antimicrobial resistance 4 5 3 gc arrangements of main integron species for the most dominant bacterial hosts of arg carrying integrons e coli we observed a total of 437 arg gcs arrangements with diversity of 160 subtypes attributed to 10 types they carried with 6 integrons carrying multiple arg subtypes of 5 fig 7d the most multiple one naas et al 2001 carried a total of 10 genes as gcs 8 of which were args encoding resistance to aminoglycoside aadb aaca1 aada beta lactam blaveb1 and blaoxa10 chloramphenicol cmla5 and rifamycin arr2 it is observed that aminoglycoside beta lactam and chloramphenicol args frequently comprised gcs of super typical class 1 integrons of e coli isolates while dfra16 and aada2 cmla1 aada qach were frequently carried by super atypical class 1 integrons fig s6 indicating e coli strains easily capture these multiple args on integrons and conduct multi resistance to diverse antibiotics or disinfectants fewer super arg carrying integrons were found carried by k pneumoniae n 5 5 args fig 7d with aaca4 and catb3 frequently carried while only one super arg carrying integron was carried by p aeruginosa with 5 args blavim2 qacf aaca7 catb3 blaoxa1 aada1 encoding resistance to aminoglycoside beta lactam and chloramphenicol fig 7d significantly this class 1 integron was only detected carried by p aeruginosa which may be the main vectors in the environment furthermore these super arg carrying integrons carried by k pneumoniae and p aeruginosa were all detected from clinical strains isolated from hospital cendejas et al 2010 lazaro perona et al 2018 wang et al 2017b and all of them carried aminoglycoside and chloramphenicol resistance genes therefore these dominant bacterial hosts pose risks of multiple resistance to microbial communities in environments via versatile gene acquisition systems of integrons 4 6 risk ranking of mobile args carried by integrons along with the development history we observed an increasing arg diversity and their multiple combinations of integrons this facilitates bacterial hosts to survive under selective pressure of antibiotics and even horizontal transfer among diverse species although large diversity of args n 516 have been reported to be carried by integrons their potential health and environmental risk levels are in different degrees considering their discrepancy of presence in environmental niches and their broad bacterial hosts thus the risk ranking of these diverse mobile args is necessary as reference and guidance for our monitoring and control of antimicrobial resistance disseminations here proposed a risk framework based on the assessment of two criteria 1 observed environments and 2 bacterial hosts which yields four categories risk rank i ii iii iv indicating different risk levels of mobile args mediated by integrons fig 8 risk rank i situates the highest risks whose args have been reported in diverse environments and were carried by 30 bacterial species and 50 of which were pathogens as a result there were 5 args aaca7 blaoxa10 catb3 catb8 dfra5 assigned to risk rank i encoding resistance to 4 antibiotic types including aminoglycoside beta lactam chloramphenicol and trimethoprim the risk of args carried by integrons was attributed to their mobility indicated by their hgt frequency and broad spectrum hosts though all the 516 arg subtypes should be covered for consideration for hgt risks those 5 args attributed to risk rank i with high mobility and broad spectrum bacterial hosts should be paid more attention for alleviating antimicrobial resistance mediated by integrons 4 7 perspectives and current knowledge gaps generally accepted that integrons and args they mediated propel the prosperity of antimicrobial resistance among diverse bacterial hosts and environmental niches gillings 2018 gillings et al 2015 our comprehensive summary and novel insights into the diversity bacterial hosts and environmental habitats of args could improve our knowledge on risks of antimicrobial resistance mediated by integrons for further contribution to future promotion of monitoring prediction and control strategies comprehensive survey and database integrity with the increasing studies reporting args carrying integrons it is required to keep integrating these information for improving our understanding of evolutionary progress of args mediated by integrons under the modern application of antibiotics in therapy and livestock breeding except for the temporal accumulations of args captured by integrons according to literature based time series observations the spatial shifts considering complex environmental factors are also necessary for evolutionary studies but still insufficient based on the spatial temporal development mechanisms of args mediated by integrons a more comprehensive database covering types of integrons args environments and bacterial hosts with optimized annotation pipeline could be developed and optimized to facilitate studies on mobile args with global health risks concerns furthermore based on these information models of evolutionary progress and transportation fates could be built up for prediction of the development of args mediated by integrons as important reference and guidance for future monitoring control and management of the antimicrobial resistance promoted by integrons optimization of detection methods multiple optional methods could facilitate the identification and quantification of integrons and args they carried with the pcr amplification of gcs from microbial mixture combined with ta cloning cheng et al 2019 li et al 2017 yu et al 2016 or direct metagenomic sequences che et al 2019 ma et al 2017 2016 could disclose diverse arg gcs of integrons and associated risks and thus primers design and optimization yang et al 2021 for amplification of more diverse and precise variable regions of integrons is key for improving knowledge furthermore with the increasing requirement of profiling args from complex environmental samples high throughput sequencing for total dnas or pcr products are being more frequently used kamathewatta et al 2019 ma et al 2017 marathe et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 mainly 1 integrases e g inti1 inti2 inti3 could be extracted from the metagenomic data and normalized to a single copy housekeeping gene for quantification in comparable with qpcr detection 2 multiple arg carried integrons could be annotated from assembled long metagenomic sequences from samples with diverse microbiome or from whole draft microbial genomes with the strengths of dna sequencing in high efficiency and decreasing costs more efforts could be paid for developing analysis strategies using metagenomic sequences to broaden our knowledge on arg diversity and combinations carried by integrons as well as their diverse bacterial hosts and specific habitats control strategies first antibiotic selective pressures have been verified to increase or maintain the occurrence of intergons and promote the horizontal transfer of args among species in environments barraud and ploy 2015 chainier et al 2017 lacotte et al 2017 with the purpose of decreasing the associated risk level a comprehensive identification of key selective agents e g antibiotics heavy metals disinfectants and based on which to develop removal strategies are necessary for efficiently restraining the prosperity of antimicrobial resistance mediated by integrons next till now there has been no standard for args arb and mges in discharged water or diverse environments due to their high diversity making the human and ecological health risks difficult to be systematically evaluated while developing risk assessment especially for those typical mobile args e g 5 args attributed to risk rank i and bacterial species such as e coli p aeruginosa and k pneumoniae that frequently join horizontal transfers could be emphatically focused as key nodes and indicators for standard formulation and based on which to develop comprehensive risk assessment systems for control and management of antimicrobial resistance 5 conclusion in summary our critical review fills in the research gaps of a comprehensive profile of args carried by integrons with hgt risks covering 1 detection methods and pipeline 2 arg diversity and evolutionary progress 3 environmental and geographical distribution 4 bacterial hosts 5 gene cassettes arrangements and based on which to 6 identify args with different risk levels mediated by integrons and propose future perspectives the roadmap of achieving investigation advances and control of args dissemination mediated by integrons is still on its long way but the understanding of integrons and associated mobile args warrants great efforts to step further otherwise years or decades from now the increasing diversity and multiple args that are captured by integrons could be tremendous and even dominate the prosperity of antimicrobial resistance and reach the situation of out of control with more deaths due to failure of antibiotics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

15076,water disinfection during drinking water production is one of the most important processes to ensure safe drinking water which is gaining even more importance due to the increasing impact of climate change with specific reaction partners chemical oxidants can form secondary oxidants which can cause additional damage to bacteria cases in point are chlorine dioxide which forms free available chlorine e g in the reaction with phenol and ozone which can form hydroxyl radicals e g during the reaction with natural organic matter the present work reviews the complex interplay of all these reactive species which can occur in disinfection processes and their potential to affect disinfection processes a quantitative overview of their disinfection strength based on inactivation kinetics and typical exposures is provided by unifying the current data for different oxidants it was observable that cultivated wild strains e g from wastewater treatment plants are in general more resistant towards chemical oxidants compared to lab cultivated strains from the same bacterium furthermore it could be shown that for selective strains chlorine dioxide is the strongest disinfectant highest maximum inactivation however as a broadband disinfectant ozone showed the highest strength highest average inactivation details in inactivation mechanisms regarding possible target structures and reaction mechanisms are provided thereby the formation of secondary oxidants and their role in inactivation of pathogens is decently discussed eventually possible defense responses of bacteria and

organization wwtps wastewater treatment plant data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction drinking water is safe if it is free of pathogens and other pollutants however approximately 30 of the world s population has no access to safe drinking water and more than one third is living under hygienically poor conditions who 2019 the consumption of unsafe drinking water can cause severe diseases such as cholera hepatitis or acute gastroenteritis pal et al 2018 who 2019 and thus adversely affect public health the availability of safe drinking water is aggravated by the ongoing climate change according to a report by the european environment agency it is estimated that the average global temperature will increase by 2 c in the next 20 years if no countermeasures are carried out european environment agency 2020 masson delmotte et al 2021 the increased temperature strongly favors the development of emergent waterborne diseases because the growth of many relevant bacteria as well as other waterborne diseases like viruses and parasites increases with increasing temperature ratkowsky et al 1982 walker 2018 additionally the change in the water cycle behavior such as heavy rainfall and flooding is accelerating the spread and the transport of waterborne diseases semenza 2020 furthermore the increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves combined with droughts may favor the growth of pathogens in source waters and water distribution systems hence water disinfection is of utmost importance as a powerful tool to provide hygienically safe drinking water from polluted sources an effective option for water disinfection is the application of chemical oxidants such as free available chlorine fac chlorine dioxide clo2 or ozone o3 besides the inactivation of pathogens chemical oxidants can also be used to reduce antibiotic resistant genes args which are present in e g municipal wastewater and hospital wastewater and can be taken up by other pathogens jäger et al 2018 pazda et al 2019 antibiotic resistant bacteria arb developed different ways to survive antibiotic treatment text s1 indeed arbs can have severe consequences for human health and who defined antibiotic resistance as one of the largest global health threats the spread of args can result in pathogens taking up acquiring multiple new args if severe diseases such as pneumonia tuberculosis blood poisoning and gonorrhea are caused by such multi resistant pathogens there are not many effective antibiotics against them and therefore possible treatment methods are reduced who 2018 the extensive spread of args and the importance of their removal have been reviewed recently by pazda et al 2019 showing that different args can be found in severe amounts of effluents from wwtps pazda et al 2019 antibiotics are widely used in human and veterinary medicine but also for example as growth promoters or for prophylactically reasons in animal husbandry hao et al 2014 the increase in the world s population the higher demand for food and the further emerging reemerging of diseases due to climate change smol 2012 lead to significantly higher consumption of antibiotics roberts and zembower 2020 furthermore the fact that antibiotics are easily accessible e g in grocery stores in some countries and the prophylactic usage in animal husbandry further accelerates the development and spreading of args davies and davies 2010 in fact args could be detected in wastewater alcaide and garay 1984 filali et al 2000 pazda et al 2019 schwartz et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 in the aquatic environment czekalski et al 2015 pruden et al 2006 su et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 in soil samples bougnom et al 2020 chen et al 2016 knapp et al 2010 marti et al 2013 martínez carballo et al 2007 wang et al 2014 zhu et al 2013 in water sediments chen et al 2013 czekalski et al 2014 mao et al 2014 thevenon et al 2012 and even in drinking water bergeron et al 2015 destiani and templeton 2019 sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 yu et al 2022 worldwide nowadays the development of multidrug resistance genes mrgs is observed whereby bacteria developed or acquired resistance mechanisms against several antibiotics pazda et al 2019 args are particularly relevant in water disinfection because they can be transferred horizontally amongst bacteria which facilitates their alarming spreading karkman et al 2018 while the vertical transfer of genetic information describes the transfer from parents to siblings or cells to daughter cells horizontal gene transfer hgt is the transfer from adult cells to other adult cells this hgt is mostly limited to short pieces of dna as args and does not result in the transfer of entire genomes as it happens in the vertical gene transfer hgt might appear through cell cell contact by a process called conjugation through a viral vector by a process called transduction or by bacteria acquiring free dna from the environment a process called transformation the latter mechanism is relevant for the water disinfection process since inactivation of some bacteria might release genetic material as args that could be taken up by surviving and environmental bacteria and render them resistant to antibiotics the deactivation of args is therefore a central topic in water disinfection one should distinguish between free extracellular args in the water matrix and the intracellular args that do require different considerations due to different accessibilities 1 1 kinetic considerations and competing reactions an important parameter for describing the inactivation of pathogens or degradation of pollutants by chemical oxidants is oxidant exposure it can be interpreted as oxidant concentration available for pollutant degradation or disinfection and is the integral of oxidant concentration over time von gunten and hoigne 1994 the presence of water matrix constituents can largely decrease the oxidant exposure available for pathogen inactivation especially in the case of wastewater nitrite can cause a significant oxidant depletion k fac no2 7 4 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 panasenko et al 1997 k clo2 no2 1 1 102 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 hoigné and bader 1994 k o3 no2 5 8 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 also ammonia may scavenge fac k fac nh3 1 3 104 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 deborde and von gunten 2008 however oxidation in wastewater treatment is typically applied to treated wastewater which should contain a low level of ammonia natural organic matter nom is the most important matrix constituent that results in oxidant depletion indeed nom has various functional groups figure s1 which are reactive toward most oxidants świetlik et al 2004 westerhoff et al 2004 hence the reactivity of an oxidant with critical cell structures in pathogens has to be compared with undesired side reactions e g with nom table 1 2 and 3 compile reaction rates of common oxidants with bacteria it has to be mentioned that the rate of inactivation per time inactivation kinetics k of bacteria depends on many factors e g strain temperature ph hunt and mariñas 1997 jamil et al 2017 however most of the available inactivation data are not unified or reported these factors aggravating a comparison between studies furthermore most of the reaction rates are not given on a molar scale which complicates comparing with other oxidants therefore reaction rate constants presented in table 1 2 and 3 have been unified on a molar scale based on the chemical disinfectant i e k m 1 s 1 eq 1 we also recommend using the molar scale in future studies corresponding calculations can be found in the excel sheet 1 in the esi the collected data is visualized in fig 1 it is worth mentioning that kinetics of bacterial inactivation in real applications is complex and might follow non linear curves shouldering or tailing jensen 2010 however using the simple chick watson model with linear second order kinetics and calculation of ct values is common in practice to compare to more sophisticated empirical models yet chick watson model does not include for instance the so called lag phase which describes the range between the first data point of monitored disinfection and the first data point of an observed effect gyürék and finch 1998 this delay can be caused by the resistance of bacteria towards specific oxidants for instance 1 l n n t n o k o x d t nt n0 number of bacteria at time t initial number of bacteria k reaction rate constants for inactivation m 1 s 1 o x d t oxidant exposure m s remarkably the reaction rate of the same bacteria can largely vary for different strains i e the reaction rate of escherichia coli with o3 can differ by three orders of magnitude dependent on the investigated strain in general it can be stated that environmental strains isolated from wastewater are more resistant to chemical oxidants compared to the commercially available references mwatondo and silverman 2021 reliable kinetic data on inactivation rates is decisive for precise predictions of pathogen abatement which can be done based on a given exposure and standardization von sonntag and von gunten 2012 both a standardized and representative procedure for determining reaction rate and more reliable data on inactivation kinetics are needed to improve the understanding and prediction of inactivation processes in oxidative treatment to compare the efficiency of pathogen inactivation by different oxidants it is necessary to multiply the inactivation rate with typical exposures of the corresponding oxidant therefore literature values for oxidant exposure were taken which resembles typical oxidant exposures for the corresponding oxidants in secondary wastewater effluent at ph 8 the exposures were determined by adding 45 µm of each oxidant and monitoring the oxidant depletion for 1 hour by using colorimetric methods lee and von gunten 2010 the final exposure can be calculated by the integral of the residual oxidant concentration over time the product of the exposure and the inactivation rate k allows to calculate the logarithmic inactivation effect according to the chick watson model eq 1 the range of pathogen inactivation imin and imax and the average inactivation iave are shown in table 4 table 4 shows that the low inactivation kinetics of clo2 is compensated by the high oxidant exposure in wastewater indicating that clo2 is most effective followed by o3 and fac which have a similar effect on disinfection it must be mentioned that the effectiveness order may also vary depending on the composition of the water matrix e g the effectivity of fac largely depends on the n content in the organic matter since it has high reaction rates with amines deborde and von gunten 2008 although clo2 shows the highest possible inactivation the average value for o3 is one order of magnitude higher than clo2 this shows that although clo2 has higher exposure and fast inactivation with specific bacterial strains o3 is a more broadband disinfectant furthermore one has to consider the formation of secondary oxidants which can contribute to disinfection see chapter 1 2 the assessment of the oxidant exposure becomes even more complicated when it comes to the deactivation of intracellular args here cell wall cell membrane and endoplasmic matter contribute to oxidant depletion by critically reviewing the available literature for reaction rate constants of the different oxidants with different bacterial constituents dodd concluded that the effectiveness of a disinfectant to deactivate args depends strongly on the reactivity towards the endoplasmic constituents including amino acids lipids saccharides and nucleic acids dodd 2012 to this end coherent data is still lacking on inactivation kinetics oxidant exposures in real water matrices and intracellular biochemical reactions and their effect on the viability of bacteria further research with standardized experimental conditions is needed combining reaction rate with oxidant exposure in different matrices for different oxidants to improve the understanding of disinfection processes for instance investigating the inactivation kinetics of the same bacterial strain under a broader range of different conditions e g ph temperature would increase the understanding of inactivation processes during waste water treatment and promote disinfection optimization 1 2 secondary oxidants in oxidative water treatment the primary oxidants e g fac clo2 and o3 can form numerous secondary oxidants which can contribute to pollutant degradation disinfection and by product formation table 5 it is important to consider that the formation and the yield of secondary oxidants strongly depend on the reaction partner of the primary oxidant abdighahroudi et al 2021 hupperich et al 2020 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 however which secondary oxidants and how they are formed during disinfection in intracellular reactions and cell matrix conditions remain unrevealed the participation of the formed secondary oxidants on the disinfection mechanism of the corresponding primary oxidant is not fully understood yet although the inactivation efficiency of the secondary oxidants might be lower e g in the case of chloramines by using fac as the primary oxidant the low reactivity can lead to longer lifetimes of the secondary oxidant and therefore higher exposures the high exposure of secondary oxidants can indeed effect the inactivation efficiency of the corresponding primary oxidants the present review deals with mechanistic aspects of disinfection of several oxidants considering the formation and fate of secondary oxidants during the inactivation mechanism and shows that further research is needed to understand these mechanisms fully 2 target structures reactivity and effect on viability the primary side of attack at bacteria and corresponding inactivation mechanism differs strongly for each oxidant a scheme of possible reaction partners is shown in fig 2 the oxidants can react with different chemical structures of the cell membrane e g double bonds of the lipid double layer or the amino acids of the membrane proteins or the cytoplasm e g the amino acids of proteins or the nucleotides within dna most of these reactions are ph dependent since reactive functional groups occur in different species for instance phenol which resembles a reactive moiety of the amino acid tyrosine has a pka of 10 hoigné and bader 1994 thus the predominant species at ph 10 is the neutral phenol species and only at ph 10 the deprotonated phenolate species becomes predominant however phenolate reacts several orders of magnitude faster than the neutral phenol species with most chemical oxidants neta et al 1988 therefore the phenolate species controls the reaction rate even at neutral ph it has to be mentioned that also the speciation of the oxidant affects the reaction rate in that the different species show significant differences in reactivity e g hocl ocl in the case of fac deborde and von gunten 2008 speciation of both reactants oxidant and target structure results in quite a complex ph dependent reaction rate whereby reaction rate constants can vary by several orders of magnitude since reaction rates are the key to identifying the most important oxidant target among the cells constituents reliable ph dependent reaction rates are decisive in understanding inactivation mechanisms by calculating reaction rates at specific ph values although the reaction on the surface of the cell can happen at different ph values the cytoplasm of bacteria has a typical ph of around 7 padan et al 1981 porcelli et al 2005 zilberstein et al 1984 2 1 lipid layer and effect on viability the phospholipid bilayer surrounding bacterial cells consists of unsaturated fatty acids as shown in figure s2 the double bonds in these fatty acids display a high electron density where electrophilic oxidants might attack e g o3 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 a reaction with the membrane may lead to membrane lysis and leakage of inner cell components and eventually to a lethal event cho et al 2010 however in this scenario the inner cell compounds e g genetic material may stay intact yoon et al 2017 and can arrive in the bulk solution this means args might be transferred to other bacteria via hgt the reactivity of common oxidants with double bonds follows the order o3 104 m 1 s 1 fac clo2 nh2 cl 1 m 1 s 1 abdighahroudi et al 2021 deborde and von gunten 2008 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 hence o3 is the most effective in attacking double bonds thereby a fast criegee reaction may break down the carbon chain structure which can explain the loss in membrane integrity of bacteria observed in ozonation cho et al 2010 thereby o3 binds to the double bond and causes cleavage of the pi bond partial oxidation or cleavage of the whole double bond and formation of carbonyl moieties von sonntag and von gunten 2012 other oxidants cannot interact with the membrane significantly but cause damage to membrane proteins or diffuse into the cytoplasm and cause inner cell damage cho et al 2010 2 2 proteins amino acids reactivity and effect on viability another point of attack in bacterial cells are proteins peptides and amino acids since proteins have different functions in bacterial cells their inactivation may affect the viability of bacterial cells more critically than the degradation of free amino acids in bacterial cells proteins are chains of amino acids whereby the primary amines of the free amino acids are present as secondary amines with a ketone group at the alpha carbon known as amides figure s3 amides are strongly deactivated making peptide bonds hard to break deborde and von gunten 2008 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 hence a reaction of oxidants will mainly happen at the functional side groups of the amino acids of peptides and proteins figure s4 shows the structure of the functional side groups of the 20 canonical proteinogenic amino acids and categorizes these groups according to their structure fig 3 summarizes the range of the reactivity at ph 7 of different oxidants towards the functional groups in amino acid side groups the corresponding calculations for exemplary compounds can be found in the excel sheet 2 in the esi oh reacts with all structures at near diffusion controlled rates buxton et al 1988 and thus is not selective toward specific moieties this results in a very short lifetime and low oh exposures and thus a limited effect on the pathogens viability however if oh are formed as secondary oxidants e g from the reaction of o3 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 at sites in pathogens that are crucial for their vitality their immediate reaction at surrounding sites may enhance the cell damage significantly o3 reacts somewhat more selective than oh with secondary and tertiary amines olefins phenols and reduced sulfur containing groups hoigné et al 1983 hoigné and bader 1983 lee and von gunten 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 overall 7 out of 20 canonical amino acids can be considered reactive with o3 i e n containing s containing and aromatic sidechains free available bromine fab is a quite reactive oxidant showing reactivity towards alkenes phenols anilines n containing compounds and s containing compounds heeb et al 2014 the selectivity of fab is therefore comparable with o3 however the current available data for fab reaction rates is quite limited and more research is needed fac reacts with most n containing side groups and all s containing amino acids deborde and von gunten 2008 i e 7 out of 20 canonical amino acids and is similar selective as o3 and fab in its reaction with amino acids the reaction of fac with n containing moieties may also form chloramines see chapter 3 2 these chloramines can principally cause further cell damage or reform the original amino acid in a reaction with a reductant see below clo2 is way more selective than oh o3 and fac since it mainly reacts with phenolic moieties aromatic amines and thiols sharma and sohn 2012 hence it may build up high exposures in the endoplasm additionally clo2 probably forms significant yields of fac and chlorite clo2 at the reactive sites in the endoplasm which may increase its disinfection strength see chapter 4 indeed fac and clo2 act together very synergistically since their target structures are nearly complementary only cysteine and tryptophan are degraded by both oxidants the reaction of chemical oxidants with membrane proteins may reduce the biological function by changing e g their quaternary structure in that regard the kind of degradation is very much dependent on the kind of oxidant present due to the different target structures inside the protein 2 3 genetic material reactivity and effect viability the oxidation of the genetic material cf further information in si figure s5 and text s2 can lead to a single base lesion he et al 2019 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 dna double strand breaks fragmentation suquet et al 2010 von sonntag 2006 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and consequently alteration in the supercoiled structure ishizaki et al 1987 sawadaishi et al 1985 if these reactions occur at args these genes would lose their transformation activity due to modification of the chemical structure which means that the args are deactivated it is noteworthy that the deactivation of genes is dependent on the oxidant exposure but independent of the oxidant concentration choi et al 2021 yoon et al 2021 it has been reported that the reactivity of the oxidants towards the amplicon is increasing with increasing length of the genome which can be explained by the increased number of possible reaction partners choi et al 2021 he et al 2019 nihemaiti et al 2020 thereby oh is causing very effective double strand breakage nihemaiti et al 2020 resulting in an instant loss of transforming activity he et al 2019 this high efficiency in double strand breakages is caused by the high reaction rate constants of oh with amplicons he et al 2019 nihemaiti et al 2020 compared to oh the loss of transforming activity was less pronounced in the case of o3 followed by fac clo2 and chloramines he et al 2019 bacteria can initiate countermeasures such as repair mechanisms friedberg et al 2005 which explains why the loss of transformation activity was slower than the corresponding gene degradation nihemaiti et al 2020 however different bacteria have different repair mechanisms this is one reason lag phases and inactivation rates can largely vary for different bacteria or strains table 1 2 and 3 considering that nearly all oxidants also form secondary oxidants table 5 the inactivation mechanisms are very complex and will be discussed for each oxidant in the following chapters 3 free available chlorine fac is the most common disinfectant used for water treatment the inactivation of bacteria and viruses by fac has been proven by various studies de beer et al 1994 engelbrecht et al 1980 floyd et al 1979 le dantec et al 2002 nakagawara et al 1998 nuanualsuwan and cliver 2003 page et al 2010 venkobachar et al 1977 wigginton et al 2012 fac is a selective oxidant that predominantly reacts with amines sulfides activated double bonds aromatic compounds and some inorganic compounds such as reduced iron manganese and dihydrogen sulfide deborde and von gunten 2008 the active agent in chlorination is hypochlorous acid hocl which can dissociate to hypochlorite ocl pka 7 54 deborde and von gunten 2008 the reactivity of the conjugated base ocl is several orders of magnitude lower than hocl deborde and von gunten 2008 hence disinfection and reaction with organic and inorganic compounds become significantly weaker at ph 7 deborde and von gunten 2008 chloramines can be produced by the addition of ammonia prior to chlorination berliner 1931 chloramines have higher selectivity than fac and can be applied in waters that have a strong fac demand and high ph vikesland et al 1998 3 1 reaction with the water matrix the reaction of fac with nom leads to the formation of harmful halogenated organic compounds such as trihalomethanes thm halogenated acetonitriles han and haloacetic acids haa gallard and von gunten 2002 lu et al 2009 richardson et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 besides the formation of harmful halogenated disinfection by products dbps gallard and von gunten 2002 the reaction of fac with specific matrix constituents can lead to the formation of secondary reactive species such as chloramines and fab berliner 1931 farkas et al 1949 chloramine formation is observed in wastewater matrices treated with fac fayyad and al sheikh 2001 although chloramines can be considered a reactive species their inactivation rate is much lower than fac indeed the addition of different amino acids to wastewater to increase the chloramine formation resulted in a decrease in e coli inactivation efficiency fayyad and al sheikh 2001 typical matrices of natural waters and municipal wastewaters contain bromide br and sometimes iodide i gruchlik et al 2014 li et al 2020 magazinovic et al 2004 and the treatment of br and i containing water by fac or chloramine has been reported to increase the cytotoxicity due to formation of brominated and iodinated products criquet and allard 2021 dong et al 2017 indeed fac reacts fast with br and i k hocl br 5 3 103 m 1 s 1 and k hocl i 1 1 108 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 deborde and von gunten 2008 in the case of br the reaction results in fab while i is oxidized by fac to free available iodine fai which is further oxidized to iodate rapidly thus significant fai exposures are unlikely to happen in the presence of fac however chloramines can also form fai but not further oxidize it to form iodate bichsel and von gunten 1999 hence fai is a potential secondary oxidant of chloramines fab reacts fast with amines to form bromamines e g k hobr ammonia 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 heeb et al 2014 however the knowledge about the disinfection strength of fab bromamines and fai is limited cf chapter 5 2 potentially formed free available halogen species can indeed play a role in water disinfection mechanisms the disinfection strength of fab is only marginally lower compared to fac e g 57 µm fac leads to 4 log inactivation of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa after 2 min at 25 c at ph 7 while 52 µm free bromine yield 92 8 and 85 5 inactivation under the same conditions respectively and 3 log inactivation was reached after 4 min wojtowicz 2004 and it is used for disinfection of for instance spa and pool water daiber et al 2016 br and nom concentration in natural waters and wastewater largely varies from a few µg l 1 up to mg l 1 magazinovic et al 2004 formed fab may contribute to the disinfection but also form undesired by products bromate bro3 and halo organic haag and hoigné 1983 fab can undergo reactions with matrix compounds for instance phenolic compounds k hobr phenol 1 8 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 heeb et al 2014 and forms halogenated dbps judd and jeffrey 1995 the formation of toxic dbps is known to be strongly matrix dependent wirzberger et al 2021 the efficiency of bacterial inactivation during the water and wastewater treatment due to secondarily formed fab stills lacks decent investigations recent research indicated that fac could also form hydroxyl radicals oh as another secondary oxidant rodríguez and von gunten 2020 in the postulated pathway fac reacts with hydroquinone hq and forms benzoquinone bq bq reacts with another hq molecule to two semiquinone radicals sq which further reacts with o2 and forms a superoxide radical o2 eventually o2 reacts with fac and forms oh rodríguez and von gunten 2020 intrinsic formed oh might contribute to the inactivation of pathogens chapter 5 3 2 reaction with cell constituents the chlorination of an e coli suspension leads to the leakage of inner cell compounds e g proteins therefore it was concluded that fac mainly inactivates bacterial cells by changing the membrane s permeability venkobachar et al 1977 since fac shows only a low reactivity towards unsaturated fatty acids in the double lipid layer deborde and von gunten 2008 pattison et al 2003 the main target structures are probably in the membrane proteins therefore the reaction of fac with proteins and with amino acids as their building blocks have been widely studied hawkins and davies 1998a hazell and stocker 1993 how et al 2017 hureiki et al 1994 na and olson 2007 pattison et al 2007 tan et al 1987b winterbourn 1985 the reactions of fac with proteins showed irreversible denaturation fragmentation and amino acid cross linking vissers and winterbourn 1991 the latter can be developed either by forming covalent bonds between sulfur and nitrogen of thiol and lysine respectively fu et al 2002 or by the oxidation of tyrosine which leads to the formation of tyrosine phenoxyl radicals which eventually form bityrosines vissers and winterbourn 1991 the primary amines of the free amino acids in general react very fast with fac deborde and von gunten 2008 and lead to chlorination of the primary amine how et al 2017 tan et al 1987b however in the peptide bond the nitrogen atoms are present as amides largely hampering an oxidative attack at the nitrogen jensen et al 1999 thus it is more likely that the reaction of fac occurs at other functional groups of the amino acid side groups such as phenolic groups sulfides primary amines and olefins a case in point is cysteine which contains a highly reactive thiol group that even reacts faster than the free amino group with fac indeed the degradation of the amino group could only be observed after the sulfhydryl group was fully degraded arnhold et al 1991 moreover primary amines also exist in peptides as side groups of incorporated amino acids that also could react with fac lysine in fact amino acids with amine containing amino groups are in excess over sulfur containing amino acids ulmschneider and sansom 2001 winterbourn 1985 therefore it can be assumed that these functional groups are the main reaction partners of fac in protein reactions it was experimentally proven that chloramines are formed during the reaction of fac with proteins hawkins and davies 1998b hazell and stocker 1993 vissers and winterbourn 1991 during the reaction of fac with protein amino groups approximately 20 30 of the added fac is converted to chloramines hawkins and davies 1999 these protein derived chloramines can decompose to form nitrogen centered radicals with diverse follow up reactions such as inter and intra molecular hydrogen atom abstraction and protein fragmentation hawkins and davies 1998b and are thus substantially transformed see fig 4 hence the reaction of fac with amines to chloramines can effectively inactivate pathogens however contradictory to the mechanism reported by hawkins et al protonated amines are less reactive compared to the corresponding neutral species abdighahroudi et al 2022 therefore the neutral amines are the main reaction partners with fac it has been shown that low dosed fac concentrations significantly increased the conjugation frequency guo et al 2015 as mentioned before the application of fac increases the permeability of bacteria by forming more potential pili or pores on the surface guo et al 2015 this causes an easier donation and acceptance of arg during conjugation additionally the inactivation of arb by fac is causing the release of their args which can be easier incorporated by bacteria that are only partly damaged during fac treatment this overall causes the enrichment of args in bacteria after fac treatment jin et al 2020 thus it can be concluded that fac disinfection can promote hgt by conjugation guo et al 2015 jin et al 2020 3 3 reaction with genetic material recent studies provided evidence that fac not only causes protein damage but also damages the genetic material of bacteria a two step reaction model has been postulated for the reaction of amplicons with fac whereby the reversible n chlorination of nucleotide bases is the first step the n chlorination is causing a disruption of the h bonding with the pairing base these bases are further reacting with fac causing irreversible c chlorination choi et al 2021 he et al 2019 it was shown that the kinetic of the irreversible c chlorination is accelerated by higher fac exposures and by a higher abundance of nucleotide bases choi et al 2021 in general the reaction of fac with amplicons is also reported to be ph dependent choi et al 2021 yoon et al 2021 which can be explained by the speciation of fac hocl ocl deborde and von gunten 2008 for e coli inner protein damage cho et al 2010 and a correlation between dna fragmentation and fac exposure suquet et al 2010 were reported the reaction rate of fac with free dna that is not associated with bacterial cells ranges from 3 9 to 9 2 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 he et al 2019 which indicates that the reaction is fast enough to degrade genetic material at typical conditions of water treatment additionally the inactivation of extracted dna from bacteriophages is enhanced with increasing cl concentrations szczuka et al 2022 which might be related to elevated intracellular deactivation of the genetic material as mentioned above the formation of oh during fac based reaction was postulated recently rodríguez and von gunten 2020 indeed yoon et al showed that the degradation of dna segments could be significantly hampered in the presence of t buoh which is a selective scavenger for oh yoon et al 2021 additionally the absence of t buoh caused a conformational change from the supercoiled to the linear form and later also caused fragmentation in the presence of t buoh none of these conformational changes were observed yoon et al 2021 the formation of oh as a secondary oxidant of fac seems therefore very likely the deactivation of intracellular genetic material such as intracellular args is much slower compared to the inactivation of the bacteria itself thus args can still be intact while the bacteria itself is inactivated he et al 2019 this observation is explainable by the fact that fac and its secondary oxidants are much stronger scavenged by constituents of the cytoplasmic matter than the wastewater or drinking water matrix e g by envelope lipids and proteins which largely hampers arg deactivation by fac by reviewing the literature about the application of fac for disinfection dodd 2012 concluded that the deactivation of args might be possible however the required concentration and contact time exposure would be above the upper limit of the drinking water regulations dodd 2012 suquet et al 2010 this is in accordance with more recent results which showed that the required fac concentration for arg deactivation and suppression of arg transfer is significantly higher than that of arb inactivation guo et al 2015 jin et al 2020 this fact can become problematic since fac is known to form harmful dbps rook 1976 the toxicity of these dbps is known pan et al 2014 wang et al 2007 therefore these compounds are regulated in drinking water thus the formation of harmful dbps may indeed limit the application of fac for args deactivation 4 chlorine dioxide clo2 is used as an alternative for fac during waste water treatment processes to avoid the formation of the harmful halogenated dbps formed during the application of fac in water treatment zhang et al 2000 compared with fac clo2 is a stronger disinfectant that does not dissociate and therefore shows higher efficiency in a broader ph range junli et al 1997 clo2 reacts very fast with electron rich functional groups such as activated aromatic systems huber et al 2005 with activated double bonds hoigné and bader 1994 and activated neutral amines in the order tertiary secondary primary amines fig 3 rosenblatt et al 1967 however as mentioned earlier the reactivity with dissociating functional groups is ph depending for example clo2 reacts only very slowly with protonated amines abdighahroudi et al 2022 wang et al 2010 4 1 reaction with the matrix constituents in the water matrix clo2 undergoes reactions with all the mentioned functional groups of the nom of the water matrix this is the main driver of clo2 depletion in the water matrix which is rather slow due to the high selectivity of clo2 hence clo2 can also be applied in waters with high organic matter contents lee and von gunten 2010 apart from direct reactions of clo2 the disinfection may also be controlled by several secondary oxidants table 5 clo2 forms fac in the reaction with phenol and phenolic compounds hupperich et al 2020 rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 therefore the reaction of clo2 with functional phenolic and olefinic moieties of nom is responsible for fac formation during water treatment hupperich et al 2020 the yields of fac by using e g suwannee river natural organic matter srnom vary between 22 and 25 per consumed clo2 hupperich et al 2020 rougé et al 2018 this shows that clo2 based disinfection can include a considerable amount of fac as a secondary oxidant and the secondary oxidants formed by fac as described above fac formation also leads to the formation of chlorine derived dbps however it seems that the formed yield of fac is not high enough to form the known undesired dbps from fac disinfection since no or only low concentrations of dbps are observed during clo2 treatment al otoum et al 2016 compared to chlorination zhang et al 2000 for example the addition of 4 5 mg l 1 fac to 3 mg l 1 doc suwannee river fulvic acid srfa buffered at ph 7 4 leads to the formation of 211 µg l 1 chloroform after five days of reaction time while 6 mg l 1 clo2 lead to only 0 36 µg l 1 chloroform under the same experimental conditions zhang et al 2000 one has to take into account that due to the low concentrations of intrinsically formed fac fac may be consumed immediately by the water matrix however the behavior of intrinsically formed fac in different water matrices is yet not investigated it is conceivable that the reaction of clo2 with the organic matter can be considered pre oxidation which hampers the formation of dbps during the reaction of intrinsic formed fac with doc this is in analogy to ozonation since ozonation also results in a lower dbps formation potential of fac in a subsequent chlorination step hua and reckhow 2013 4 2 reaction with cell constituents although the bactericidal effect of clo2 has been known since the first half of the 20th century ridenour and ingols 1947 the inactivation mechanism of clo2 is not fully revealed the efficiency of the inactivation of e coli by clo2 depends on the disinfection dose ph faster in alkaline media and temperature whereby the latter had the smallest impact ofori et al 2017 the application of clo2 to e coli leads to an inhibition of different enzymes e g dehydrogenase roller et al 1980 β d galactosidase ofori et al 2017 already after a very short reaction time while the cells remain viable furthermore clo2 partially inhibits the protein synthesis of e coli which is proportional to the dose of clo2 roller et al 1980 the inactivation of e coli correlates with the protein release into the bulk solution which indicates that clo2 is also damaging the cell membrane furthermore using transmission electron microscopy tem and a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein assay after 1 log inactivation evidence was provided that clo2 causes damage to cell surface proteins and the cytoplasm cho et al 2010 based on the current state of knowledge it can be stated that the inactivation step which is causing the lethal event is damage of the cell membrane followed by leakage of cytoplasmic material since clo2 is unreactive towards double bonds similar to fac abdighahroudi et al 2021 deborde and von gunten 2008 which are present in the membrane lipid double layer the observed membrane damage may also be caused by the reaction with membrane proteins some amino acids show a significant reactivity toward clo2 jütte et al 2022 tan et al 1987a and their transformation might be responsible for the primary inactivation step during clo2 disinfection although cysteine shows the highest reaction rate among the amino acids towards clo2 ison et al 2006 a significant decrease in tyrosine and tryptophan residues was observed in proteins after clo2 treatment whereby most other amino acids did not degrade significantly ogata 2007 therefore it can be concluded that these residues are the main target for clo2 based oxidation for the proteins albumin and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase of saccharomyces cerevisiae loss of enzymatic activity decrease in α helix content and protein denaturation has been reported ogata 2007 similar results are reported for lysozyme ooi and branning 2017 however until today only a few studies investigated the behavior of bacterial cell proteins during clo2 treatment if the reaction of amino acids with clo2 is considered the primary inactivation step this reaction may lead to the formation of fac which might contribute to the inactivation mechanism indeed possible pathways are postulated stating the formation of fac in the reaction of clo2 with cysteine tyrosine and tryptophan ison et al 2006 napolitano et al 2005 stewart et al 2008 which has been confirmed recently for tyrosine and tryptophan 50 of clo2 jütte et al 2022 note that these amino acids belong to the most reactive towards clo2 noss et al 1986 sharma and sohn 2012 hence it can be assumed that fac is formed inside bacterial cells and may thus enhance the disinfection effect of clo2 4 3 reaction with genetic material the reactivity of clo2 towards genetic material has been barely studied yet even less is known about the dna alterations caused by clo2 recently it has been reported that clo2 causes changes in the conformation and structure of dna zhao et al 2022 when clo2 was applied to haemophilus influenza cells the dna transforming activity was not affected even after 6 log inactivation which indicates that intracellular bacterial dna seems inert toward clo2 roller et al 1980 in general the reaction rate of bacterial args towards clo2 is very slow k ranging from 0 35 1 2 101 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 he et al 2019 however even though the reaction of other constituents would outcompete the reaction of clo2 towards args a very slight deactivation of intracellular args was observed after clo2 addition to a multidrug resistant strain of bacillus subtilis he et al 2019 clo2 itself cannot explain the observed deactivation of args indeed clo2 is not the only present disinfectant as mentioned before taking this into account it becomes clear that the disinfection by clo2 in real water matrices can include 25 fac disinfection hupperich et al 2020 rougé et al 2018 which can improve disinfection additionally fac might be formed in intracellular clo2 reactions see above and could be the reason for the observed slight arg deactivation although the formation of fac with specific reaction partners has been demonstrated jütte et al 2022 the intrinsic formation and the corresponding participation of fac in clo2 based disinfection processes e g arg deactivation has not been reported yet the formation of all possible secondary oxidants formed in the application of clo2 is summarized in fig 5 to this end it can be assumed that clo2 inactivates bacteria by reacting with membrane proteins and cytoplasmic proteins in these reactions secondary oxidants such as fac can also be formed which cause further cell damage eventually including gene damage besides fac the other main transformation product is clo2 abdighahroudi et al 2021 a cytotoxic compound van wijk et al 1998 which could also be formed in the cytoplasm and participate in cell inactivation however reactions of clo2 with organic compounds are barely investigated yet furthermore clo2 is regulated by drinking water guidelines recommended threshold concentration by who of 0 7 mg l 1 guidelines for drinking water quality 2011 which means that the formation of clo2 limits the application of clo2 possible countermeasures are the reduction of clo2 by ferrous salts fe2 or by sulfur dioxide sulfite ion gordon et al 1990 katz and narkis 2001 5 ozone the application of o3 in waste water treatment can be used for the removal of micropollutants lee and von gunten 2012 abatement of taste and odor compounds glaze et al 1990 and disinfection purposes morrison et al 2022 von gunten 2003a o3 has been used for water disinfection since the beginning of the last century and has gained increasing interest after discovering that the application of chlorination may result in the formation of undesired taste and odor compounds and harmful dbps rook 1974 the reaction mechanisms and the application of o3 for water and wastewater treatment have been reviewed frequently over the last decades glaze et al 1987 lawrence and cappelli 1977 von gunten 2018 2003b 2003a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 5 1 reaction with the water matrix constituents o3 is more reactive than the oxidants discussed above which means it undergoes a fast reaction with the water matrix compounds e g nom and is therefore less stable and less selective lee and von gunten 2010 the o3 demand necessary for disinfection is much higher than the demand for micropollutant degradation in fact 108 molecules of o3 are necessary for the inactivation of one bacterial cell von sonntag and von gunten 2012 o3 reacts with matrix constituents in various ways forming several secondary oxidants which can contribute to the inactivation of pathogens thereby the most important secondary oxidants are fab haag and hoigné 1983 and oh von sonntag and von gunten 2012 which are formed in the presence of br haag and hoigné 1983 k o3 br obr o2 1 6 102 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 and organic matter respectively experiments in artificial seawater with high chloride cl and br concentrations showed that o3 is depleted within a few seconds and fab is formed which is fairly stable jung et al 2017 thereby the reaction of o3 with br outcompetes the slow reaction of o3 with cl for the removal of artemia salina during seawater ozonation the degree of inactivation by o3 and fab has been determined to be 51 9 and 6 8 respectively jung et al 2017 thus it can be assumed that fab is indeed playing a role during o3 based disinfection the formation of fac in the presence of cl is less relevant under typical conditions of water treatment since the reaction of o3 and oh with cl is very slow k o3 cl 10 3 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 k oh cl 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 levanov et al 2018 von gunten 2003a and will therefore be outcompeted by other reactions another important secondary oxidant is the oh formed in o3 reactions with organic matter the yields of oh depend on the molecular structure of nom and vary between 15 and 70 per consumed equivalent o3 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the reaction rate of oh is very fast with many matrix components and the exposure is therefore very small thus it seems reasonable that oh is scavenged by matrix components however the reported literature is contradictory in this regard for instance the inactivation of b subtilis was hampered in the presence of t buoh a selective scavenger for oh cho et al 2003 on the other hand the inactivation of e coli in the presence or absence of a different scavenger humic acid is similar hunt and mariñas 1999 the reason for this observation might be that humic acid also initiates oh formation during the reaction with o3 and thus enhancing the inactivation of e coli by oh secondary oxidants are generally formed in drinking and wastewater treatment in the bulk solution their effect on disinfection is often hard to assess since different matrix constituents scavenge these secondary oxidants oh is a very unselective oxidant which mostly reacts with diffusion controlled kinetics resulting in average lifetimes of a few µs buxton et al 1988 this results in a very low steady state concentration of oh pm range and thus in rather low disinfection strength compared to the primary disinfectant and hardly contributes to the inactivation of the bacterial cells hao et al 2012 it is reported that intracellular arg deactivation does not change significantly if extracellular produced oh are scavenged or not choi et al 2021 5 2 reaction with cell constituents compared to clo2 and fac o3 is way less selective lee and von gunten 2010 and therefore has more possible target structures for cell inactivation the o3 attack on bacterial cells has been observed in the cytoplasmic material hunt and mariñas 1999 ishizaki et al 1987 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and the cell wall or membrane cho et al 2010 christensen and giese 1954 girgin ersoy et al 2019 mcnair scott and lesher 1963 thereby o3 undergoes reactions with the double bonds present in the cell membrane pryor et al 1991 which increases the cell membrane s permeability and causes leakage of inner cell compounds mcnair scott and lesher 1963 additionally o3 reacts with different amino acids present in membrane proteins sharma and graham 2010 in the case of amino acids it is again important to mention that o3 does not react with the peptide bond itself cataldo 2006 pryor et al 1984 so only the side chains are available for an o3 attack the oxidation of amino acid side groups by o3 results in a change in the folding and binding ability of the peptide chain cataldo 2006 which may result in a loss of protein functionality the denaturation and thus the loss of the biological activity of proteins after ozonation has been reported before cataldo 2006 zhang et al 2015 the formation of secondary oxidants may also be important in intracellular reactions with o3 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 this could lead to the intracellular generation of fab in the presence of br peroxyl radicals and oh if fab is formed it will react with other inner cell compounds e g amino acids heeb et al 2014 pattison and davies 2004 and might thus increase the inactivation rate of bacteria even though the reaction of o3 with cl to form fac is very slow it might be important in the endoplasmaticum since cl can be present in very high concentrations compared to other cell constituents c cl in e coli 207 41 mm szatmári et al 2020 it is experimentally proven that bro3 formation during ozonation is accelerated if high concentrations of cl are present grguric et al 1994 if fac is formed it can either directly react with vital cell compartments or with br to form fab k hocl br hobr cl 6 84 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 which eventually forms toxic bro3 fischbacher et al 2015 therefore it can be concluded that the high cl concentrations indeed accelerate the inactivation of bacterial cells during o3 based disinfection furthermore the reaction of o3 with cytoplasmic constituents may also yield oh as a secondary oxidant nöthe et al 2009 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the mechanistic pathways and kinetics are already well described von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the formation of intracellular oh seems very likely to accelerate the inactivation of bacterial cells by fast reaction with a broad range of functional groups fig 3 thus damaging inner cell compounds 5 3 reaction with genetic material the main site of o3 attack was already concluded in the 1950s to be the cell surface even though the reaction between o3 and dna containing compounds was also observable christensen and giese 1954 by now many studies have proven that o3 based treatment of bacteria leads to a decomposition of the cell membrane cho et al 2010 girgin ersoy et al 2019 mcnair scott and lesher 1963 o3 also may diffuse into bacterial cells and the average travel distance can be estimated by the mean kinetics and the average travel distance of oh which is 6 9 nm von gunten 2003a the reactivity of o3 is four orders of magnitude slower compared to oh on average therefore it can be estimated that the average travel distance of o3 is around four orders of magnitude longer inside the cell this means o3 has an estimated average travel distance of 60 90 µm considering about 2 µm length of an e coli cell o3 could indeed reach genetic material and react with the nucleotides which eventually results in the inactivation of vital genes and thus cell death the reactivity of oh with args was reported to be very fast k 0 59 2 3 1011 m 1 s 1 he et al 2019 additionally the reaction of o3 with other cell constituents may also form the abovementioned secondary oxidants contributing to the inactivation of genetic material finally the reaction of o3 with the genetic material itself results in the formation of oh von sonntag 2006 in this case oh are formed in close proximity to the genetic material which largely facilitates their reaction with the genetic material since the traveling distance of hydroxyl radicals in bacterial cells is estimated to be 6 9 nm von gunten 2003a it is worth mentioning that oh attack at dna rna is extremely effective in gene inactivation due to string breaking which inhibits transforming activity von sonntag 2006 evidence for the participation of oh during o3 based reaction with dna has been reported recently yoon et al 2021 o3 treatment of supercoiled dna has been reported to cause single strand cleavage of circular dna resulting in a supercoiled structure alteration sawadaishi et al 1985 however this observation did not occur in the presence of t buoh yoon et al 2021 indicating that oh are responsible for the change in the supercoiled structure additionally the reaction rate constant of o3 with args was lower in the presence of a selective oh scavenger choi et al 2021 these findings show that oh might play a role in intracellular args deactivation if it is intrinsically formed it has to be considered that the genetic material is also protected by intracellular structures e g the cell membrane or other cell components which can hamper a direct reaction with oxidants for instance even after 5 log inactivation of e coli by o3 the intracellular args stays intact czekalski et al 2016 an increase in the dosage of o3 would cause several adverse effects such as the formation of carcinogenic bro3 fischbacher et al 2015 von gunten 2003a or n nitrosodimethylamine ndma andrzejewski et al 2008 additionally oh revealed another drawback in args deactivation monitoring the reaction of oh with dna mainly leads to strand fragmentation by cleavage of the phosphate backbone he et al 2019 by shortening the strand the arg transformation activity is lowered however it might be possible that the region of the monitored arg amplicons stays intact which gives a biased result of faster arg deactivation than amplicon degradation he et al 2019 all secondary oxidants which are known to be formed in o3 reactions are shown in fig 5 as well it becomes clear that the synergy of all secondary oxidants together with o3 as the primary oxidant is eventually responsible for bacterial inactivation 6 defense response especially aerobic bacteria are continuously exposed to oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species ros such as h2o2 or o2 forman et al 2009 to encounter ros exposure bacterial cells have developed a defense mechanism in the form of antioxidants such as glutathione gsh it was shown that the production of this tripeptide cysteine glutamic acid and glycine is induced by oxidative stress in e coli and s cerevisiae carmel harel and storz 2000 the intracellular concentration of gsh in glucose fed exponentially growing e coli was detected to be 17 mm which makes it the second most abundant metabolite after glutamate 96 mm bennett et al 2009 thus gsh is in excess over the reactive amino acids e g methionine 0 15 mm tyrosine 0 029 mm bennett et al 2009 and therefore scavenges most of the oxidants and hamper the bacterial inactivation table 6 summarizes the known reaction constants of gsh for the different primary and secondary oxidants that might be relevant during chemical water disinfection the reaction rate of fab has not been determined yet however it can be estimated from the reaction rate with cysteine k hobr cysteine 1 7 107 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 2 7 5 heeb et al 2014 since cysteine is the most reactive moiety in this tripeptide in the case of o3 and fac the reaction rate with cysteine k o3 cysteine 4 2 104 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 pryor et al 1984 and k hocl cysteine 6 7 107 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 deborde and von gunten 2008 is slower or in the same order of magnitude as the reported reaction rate for gsh see table 6 therefore it can be assumed that the reaction rate of fab with gsh is in the same order of magnitude or faster than the reaction rate of fab and cysteine this shows that all primary and secondary oxidants are highly reactive toward gsh and at concentrations in the mm range gsh is probably capable of effectively scavenging most of the disinfectants and their secondary reactive species this may be one of the reasons why disinfectants are typically added in large surplus over potential pathogens von sonntag and von gunten 2012 besides the production of scavengers repair mechanisms have been observed especially for dna damage thereby transforming activity elimination depends on the type of dna repair genes nihemaiti et al 2020 the influence of repair mechanisms becomes clear by comparing the gene degradation and the loss of transforming activity loss of transforming activity is reported to be significantly slower than the overall degradation rate of the plasmid with the same oxidant nihemaiti et al 2020 yoon et al 2021 the combination of repair mechanism and production of chemical scavengers may be responsible for the extremely high number of collisions between bacteria and oxidants 108 in the case of o3 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 until a lethal event happens and the lag phase is observed this number of collisions may be similar or even higher in the case of fac clo2 and chloramines since their inactivation kinetics is similar or slower the stress response is surely way more complex in bacterial consortia biofilms which are hardly investigated 7 additional in vivo effects one must consider that the above mentioned reaction rates do not necessarily apply to amino acids associated with peptides or proteins by investigating the influence of other amino acids in oligopeptides and proteins on the reactivity of tryptophan towards clo2 it was observed that several further factors influence the reactivity under real conditions ge et al 2020 for instance the position of the amino acid in the peptide the accessibility the protein folding and the surrounding amino acid moieties influence the reaction rate the attached amino acids may lead to a shift of the pk a of the reactive moieties which has a strong influence on the apparent second order reaction rate especially at ph 7 additionally the electron density is changed and therefore an electrophilic attack is either accelerated or hampered furthermore the accessibility of the reactive moiety in the polypeptide has a strong influence on the reaction rate ge et al 2020 other important factors for arg deactivation might be the accessibility of the arg on the genome the supercoiling of the dna helix strand and the type of dna for instance it has been shown for extracellular dna that the deactivation efficiency of genomic dna is higher than plasmid dna zhang et al 2019 in contradictory two other studies determined similar reactivity of plasmid borne and chromosomal dna towards o3 he et al 2019 yoon et al 2021 thus it seems very reasonable that all observed in vivo effects are also oxidant dependent additionally it has been shown that double stranded dna is less reactive than single stranded dna toward fac szczuka et al 2022 the deactivation efficiency also depends on the length of the gene since longer amplicons have higher reactivity due to more possible points of attack choi et al 2021 he et al 2019 yoon et al 2021 8 conclusion and further research suggestions based on the current knowledge it can be concluded that all oxidants applied in water treatment also form a different set of secondary oxidants in their reaction with the water matrix and their reaction with bacterial cells see fig 5 all the primary and secondary oxidants might more or less contribute to the inactivation mechanism of cells of different bacterial species although the formation of secondary oxidants is known little is known about their influence on the overall disinfection mechanism therefore it is impossible to estimate the full inactivation mechanism of the primary oxidant at this point further research is necessary about the inactivation in the absence or presence of different scavengers to scavenge secondary oxidants as discussed above the participation of oh during o3 disinfection processes has been shown recently the same procedure can be carried out for clo2 by using e g methionine to scavenge intrinsically formed fac the participation of fac in clo2 based disinfection processes is a very interesting research field however besides the possible formation of fac during the reaction with nom or specific amino acids see above no data is available so far it is crucial to further normalize the available data in the literature regarding the inactivation kinetics of different oxidants on a molar scale this review summarized the available data for the inactivation of bacteria with the oxidants o3 clo2 and fac in water in literature also the molar inactivation rate constants for the inactivation of viruses with o3 are available morrison et al 2022 as shown above the inactivation rate constants can vary strongly regarding species strain or oxidant it would be of great advantage to increase the available data on the inactivation rates in the molar scale which allow the comparison between different oxidants and also will help to improve the understanding of disinfection mechanisms furthermore it allows to predict disinfection of pathogens based on oxidant exposures and thus may help to improve water disinfection processes e g by more precise oxidant dosage furthermore it would be very useful to investigate the exact reaction mechanism of the different oxidants towards dna the reaction mechanism for fac with different amplicons has been described in detail however the available data for other oxidants is still lacking therefore additional data would be of great use for understanding which oxidant primary or secondary is responsible for which part of the degradation or deactivation of the genome it is necessary to investigate further which secondary oxidants are formed in which reactions and determine the yields for instance the formation of fac during the reaction of clo2 with different functional groups of amino acids this might be done by comparing the inactivation of mutated strains of the same bacteria the mutations should be in a way that the results reveal insights in the intrinsic formation and participation of secondary oxidants e g lack of specific defense proteins furthermore as discussed in this review secondary oxidants can form further oxidants which can be named tertiary oxidants this chain of different reactive species gives a very complicated system but also opens a great field of research further in vivo effects should be investigated as well for instance the supercoiling folding extend influence on args deactivation by different oxidants or the args accessibility towards chemical inactivation regarding the location on the genome only if the inactivation mechanisms are fully revealed and understood the oxidant applications can be optimized to achieve an efficient deactivation of args declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts of interest to declare acknowledgement the present study was financially support by

15076,water disinfection during drinking water production is one of the most important processes to ensure safe drinking water which is gaining even more importance due to the increasing impact of climate change with specific reaction partners chemical oxidants can form secondary oxidants which can cause additional damage to bacteria cases in point are chlorine dioxide which forms free available chlorine e g in the reaction with phenol and ozone which can form hydroxyl radicals e g during the reaction with natural organic matter the present work reviews the complex interplay of all these reactive species which can occur in disinfection processes and their potential to affect disinfection processes a quantitative overview of their disinfection strength based on inactivation kinetics and typical exposures is provided by unifying the current data for different oxidants it was observable that cultivated wild strains e g from wastewater treatment plants are in general more resistant towards chemical oxidants compared to lab cultivated strains from the same bacterium furthermore it could be shown that for selective strains chlorine dioxide is the strongest disinfectant highest maximum inactivation however as a broadband disinfectant ozone showed the highest strength highest average inactivation details in inactivation mechanisms regarding possible target structures

organization wwtps wastewater treatment plant data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction drinking water is safe if it is free of pathogens and other pollutants however approximately 30 of the world s population has no access to safe drinking water and more than one third is living under hygienically poor conditions who 2019 the consumption of unsafe drinking water can cause severe diseases such as cholera hepatitis or acute gastroenteritis pal et al 2018 who 2019 and thus adversely affect public health the availability of safe drinking water is aggravated by the ongoing climate change according to a report by the european environment agency it is estimated that the average global temperature will increase by 2 c in the next 20 years if no countermeasures are carried out european environment agency 2020 masson delmotte et al 2021 the increased temperature strongly favors the development of emergent waterborne diseases because the growth of many relevant bacteria as well as other waterborne diseases like viruses and parasites increases with increasing temperature ratkowsky et al 1982 walker 2018 additionally the change in the water cycle behavior such as heavy rainfall and flooding is accelerating the spread and the transport of waterborne diseases semenza 2020 furthermore the increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves combined with droughts may favor the growth of pathogens in source waters and water distribution systems hence water disinfection is of utmost importance as a powerful tool to provide hygienically safe drinking water from polluted sources an effective option for water disinfection is the application of chemical oxidants such as free available chlorine fac chlorine dioxide clo2 or ozone o3 besides the inactivation of pathogens chemical oxidants can also be used to reduce antibiotic resistant genes args which are present in e g municipal wastewater and hospital wastewater and can be taken up by other pathogens jäger et al 2018 pazda et al 2019 antibiotic resistant bacteria arb developed different ways to survive antibiotic treatment text s1 indeed arbs can have severe consequences for human health and who defined antibiotic resistance as one of the largest global health threats the spread of args can result in pathogens taking up acquiring multiple new args if severe diseases such as pneumonia tuberculosis blood poisoning and gonorrhea are caused by such multi resistant pathogens there are not many effective antibiotics against them and therefore possible treatment methods are reduced who 2018 the extensive spread of args and the importance of their removal have been reviewed recently by pazda et al 2019 showing that different args can be found in severe amounts of effluents from wwtps pazda et al 2019 antibiotics are widely used in human and veterinary medicine but also for example as growth promoters or for prophylactically reasons in animal husbandry hao et al 2014 the increase in the world s population the higher demand for food and the further emerging reemerging of diseases due to climate change smol 2012 lead to significantly higher consumption of antibiotics roberts and zembower 2020 furthermore the fact that antibiotics are easily accessible e g in grocery stores in some countries and the prophylactic usage in animal husbandry further accelerates the development and spreading of args davies and davies 2010 in fact args could be detected in wastewater alcaide and garay 1984 filali et al 2000 pazda et al 2019 schwartz et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 in the aquatic environment czekalski et al 2015 pruden et al 2006 su et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 in soil samples bougnom et al 2020 chen et al 2016 knapp et al 2010 marti et al 2013 martínez carballo et al 2007 wang et al 2014 zhu et al 2013 in water sediments chen et al 2013 czekalski et al 2014 mao et al 2014 thevenon et al 2012 and even in drinking water bergeron et al 2015 destiani and templeton 2019 sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 yu et al 2022 worldwide nowadays the development of multidrug resistance genes mrgs is observed whereby bacteria developed or acquired resistance mechanisms against several antibiotics pazda et al 2019 args are particularly relevant in water disinfection because they can be transferred horizontally amongst bacteria which facilitates their alarming spreading karkman et al 2018 while the vertical transfer of genetic information describes the transfer from parents to siblings or cells to daughter cells horizontal gene transfer hgt is the transfer from adult cells to other adult cells this hgt is mostly limited to short pieces of dna as args and does not result in the transfer of entire genomes as it happens in the vertical gene transfer hgt might appear through cell cell contact by a process called conjugation through a viral vector by a process called transduction or by bacteria acquiring free dna from the environment a process called transformation the latter mechanism is relevant for the water disinfection process since inactivation of some bacteria might release genetic material as args that could be taken up by surviving and environmental bacteria and render them resistant to antibiotics the deactivation of args is therefore a central topic in water disinfection one should distinguish between free extracellular args in the water matrix and the intracellular args that do require different considerations due to different accessibilities 1 1 kinetic considerations and competing reactions an important parameter for describing the inactivation of pathogens or degradation of pollutants by chemical oxidants is oxidant exposure it can be interpreted as oxidant concentration available for pollutant degradation or disinfection and is the integral of oxidant concentration over time von gunten and hoigne 1994 the presence of water matrix constituents can largely decrease the oxidant exposure available for pathogen inactivation especially in the case of wastewater nitrite can cause a significant oxidant depletion k fac no2 7 4 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 panasenko et al 1997 k clo2 no2 1 1 102 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 hoigné and bader 1994 k o3 no2 5 8 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 also ammonia may scavenge fac k fac nh3 1 3 104 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 deborde and von gunten 2008 however oxidation in wastewater treatment is typically applied to treated wastewater which should contain a low level of ammonia natural organic matter nom is the most important matrix constituent that results in oxidant depletion indeed nom has various functional groups figure s1 which are reactive toward most oxidants świetlik et al 2004 westerhoff et al 2004 hence the reactivity of an oxidant with critical cell structures in pathogens has to be compared with undesired side reactions e g with nom table 1 2 and 3 compile reaction rates of common oxidants with bacteria it has to be mentioned that the rate of inactivation per time inactivation kinetics k of bacteria depends on many factors e g strain temperature ph hunt and mariñas 1997 jamil et al 2017 however most of the available inactivation data are not unified or reported these factors aggravating a comparison between studies furthermore most of the reaction rates are not given on a molar scale which complicates comparing with other oxidants therefore reaction rate constants presented in table 1 2 and 3 have been unified on a molar scale based on the chemical disinfectant i e k m 1 s 1 eq 1 we also recommend using the molar scale in future studies corresponding calculations can be found in the excel sheet 1 in the esi the collected data is visualized in fig 1 it is worth mentioning that kinetics of bacterial inactivation in real applications is complex and might follow non linear curves shouldering or tailing jensen 2010 however using the simple chick watson model with linear second order kinetics and calculation of ct values is common in practice to compare to more sophisticated empirical models yet chick watson model does not include for instance the so called lag phase which describes the range between the first data point of monitored disinfection and the first data point of an observed effect gyürék and finch 1998 this delay can be caused by the resistance of bacteria towards specific oxidants for instance 1 l n n t n o k o x d t nt n0 number of bacteria at time t initial number of bacteria k reaction rate constants for inactivation m 1 s 1 o x d t oxidant exposure m s remarkably the reaction rate of the same bacteria can largely vary for different strains i e the reaction rate of escherichia coli with o3 can differ by three orders of magnitude dependent on the investigated strain in general it can be stated that environmental strains isolated from wastewater are more resistant to chemical oxidants compared to the commercially available references mwatondo and silverman 2021 reliable kinetic data on inactivation rates is decisive for precise predictions of pathogen abatement which can be done based on a given exposure and standardization von sonntag and von gunten 2012 both a standardized and representative procedure for determining reaction rate and more reliable data on inactivation kinetics are needed to improve the understanding and prediction of inactivation processes in oxidative treatment to compare the efficiency of pathogen inactivation by different oxidants it is necessary to multiply the inactivation rate with typical exposures of the corresponding oxidant therefore literature values for oxidant exposure were taken which resembles typical oxidant exposures for the corresponding oxidants in secondary wastewater effluent at ph 8 the exposures were determined by adding 45 µm of each oxidant and monitoring the oxidant depletion for 1 hour by using colorimetric methods lee and von gunten 2010 the final exposure can be calculated by the integral of the residual oxidant concentration over time the product of the exposure and the inactivation rate k allows to calculate the logarithmic inactivation effect according to the chick watson model eq 1 the range of pathogen inactivation imin and imax and the average inactivation iave are shown in table 4 table 4 shows that the low inactivation kinetics of clo2 is compensated by the high oxidant exposure in wastewater indicating that clo2 is most effective followed by o3 and fac which have a similar effect on disinfection it must be mentioned that the effectiveness order may also vary depending on the composition of the water matrix e g the effectivity of fac largely depends on the n content in the organic matter since it has high reaction rates with amines deborde and von gunten 2008 although clo2 shows the highest possible inactivation the average value for o3 is one order of magnitude higher than clo2 this shows that although clo2 has higher exposure and fast inactivation with specific bacterial strains o3 is a more broadband disinfectant furthermore one has to consider the formation of secondary oxidants which can contribute to disinfection see chapter 1 2 the assessment of the oxidant exposure becomes even more complicated when it comes to the deactivation of intracellular args here cell wall cell membrane and endoplasmic matter contribute to oxidant depletion by critically reviewing the available literature for reaction rate constants of the different oxidants with different bacterial constituents dodd concluded that the effectiveness of a disinfectant to deactivate args depends strongly on the reactivity towards the endoplasmic constituents including amino acids lipids saccharides and nucleic acids dodd 2012 to this end coherent data is still lacking on inactivation kinetics oxidant exposures in real water matrices and intracellular biochemical reactions and their effect on the viability of bacteria further research with standardized experimental conditions is needed combining reaction rate with oxidant exposure in different matrices for different oxidants to improve the understanding of disinfection processes for instance investigating the inactivation kinetics of the same bacterial strain under a broader range of different conditions e g ph temperature would increase the understanding of inactivation processes during waste water treatment and promote disinfection optimization 1 2 secondary oxidants in oxidative water treatment the primary oxidants e g fac clo2 and o3 can form numerous secondary oxidants which can contribute to pollutant degradation disinfection and by product formation table 5 it is important to consider that the formation and the yield of secondary oxidants strongly depend on the reaction partner of the primary oxidant abdighahroudi et al 2021 hupperich et al 2020 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 however which secondary oxidants and how they are formed during disinfection in intracellular reactions and cell matrix conditions remain unrevealed the participation of the formed secondary oxidants on the disinfection mechanism of the corresponding primary oxidant is not fully understood yet although the inactivation efficiency of the secondary oxidants might be lower e g in the case of chloramines by using fac as the primary oxidant the low reactivity can lead to longer lifetimes of the secondary oxidant and therefore higher exposures the high exposure of secondary oxidants can indeed effect the inactivation efficiency of the corresponding primary oxidants the present review deals with mechanistic aspects of disinfection of several oxidants considering the formation and fate of secondary oxidants during the inactivation mechanism and shows that further research is needed to understand these mechanisms fully 2 target structures reactivity and effect on viability the primary side of attack at bacteria and corresponding inactivation mechanism differs strongly for each oxidant a scheme of possible reaction partners is shown in fig 2 the oxidants can react with different chemical structures of the cell membrane e g double bonds of the lipid double layer or the amino acids of the membrane proteins or the cytoplasm e g the amino acids of proteins or the nucleotides within dna most of these reactions are ph dependent since reactive functional groups occur in different species for instance phenol which resembles a reactive moiety of the amino acid tyrosine has a pka of 10 hoigné and bader 1994 thus the predominant species at ph 10 is the neutral phenol species and only at ph 10 the deprotonated phenolate species becomes predominant however phenolate reacts several orders of magnitude faster than the neutral phenol species with most chemical oxidants neta et al 1988 therefore the phenolate species controls the reaction rate even at neutral ph it has to be mentioned that also the speciation of the oxidant affects the reaction rate in that the different species show significant differences in reactivity e g hocl ocl in the case of fac deborde and von gunten 2008 speciation of both reactants oxidant and target structure results in quite a complex ph dependent reaction rate whereby reaction rate constants can vary by several orders of magnitude since reaction rates are the key to identifying the most important oxidant target among the cells constituents reliable ph dependent reaction rates are decisive in understanding inactivation mechanisms by calculating reaction rates at specific ph values although the reaction on the surface of the cell can happen at different ph values the cytoplasm of bacteria has a typical ph of around 7 padan et al 1981 porcelli et al 2005 zilberstein et al 1984 2 1 lipid layer and effect on viability the phospholipid bilayer surrounding bacterial cells consists of unsaturated fatty acids as shown in figure s2 the double bonds in these fatty acids display a high electron density where electrophilic oxidants might attack e g o3 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 a reaction with the membrane may lead to membrane lysis and leakage of inner cell components and eventually to a lethal event cho et al 2010 however in this scenario the inner cell compounds e g genetic material may stay intact yoon et al 2017 and can arrive in the bulk solution this means args might be transferred to other bacteria via hgt the reactivity of common oxidants with double bonds follows the order o3 104 m 1 s 1 fac clo2 nh2 cl 1 m 1 s 1 abdighahroudi et al 2021 deborde and von gunten 2008 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 hence o3 is the most effective in attacking double bonds thereby a fast criegee reaction may break down the carbon chain structure which can explain the loss in membrane integrity of bacteria observed in ozonation cho et al 2010 thereby o3 binds to the double bond and causes cleavage of the pi bond partial oxidation or cleavage of the whole double bond and formation of carbonyl moieties von sonntag and von gunten 2012 other oxidants cannot interact with the membrane significantly but cause damage to membrane proteins or diffuse into the cytoplasm and cause inner cell damage cho et al 2010 2 2 proteins amino acids reactivity and effect on viability another point of attack in bacterial cells are proteins peptides and amino acids since proteins have different functions in bacterial cells their inactivation may affect the viability of bacterial cells more critically than the degradation of free amino acids in bacterial cells proteins are chains of amino acids whereby the primary amines of the free amino acids are present as secondary amines with a ketone group at the alpha carbon known as amides figure s3 amides are strongly deactivated making peptide bonds hard to break deborde and von gunten 2008 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 hence a reaction of oxidants will mainly happen at the functional side groups of the amino acids of peptides and proteins figure s4 shows the structure of the functional side groups of the 20 canonical proteinogenic amino acids and categorizes these groups according to their structure fig 3 summarizes the range of the reactivity at ph 7 of different oxidants towards the functional groups in amino acid side groups the corresponding calculations for exemplary compounds can be found in the excel sheet 2 in the esi oh reacts with all structures at near diffusion controlled rates buxton et al 1988 and thus is not selective toward specific moieties this results in a very short lifetime and low oh exposures and thus a limited effect on the pathogens viability however if oh are formed as secondary oxidants e g from the reaction of o3 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 at sites in pathogens that are crucial for their vitality their immediate reaction at surrounding sites may enhance the cell damage significantly o3 reacts somewhat more selective than oh with secondary and tertiary amines olefins phenols and reduced sulfur containing groups hoigné et al 1983 hoigné and bader 1983 lee and von gunten 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 overall 7 out of 20 canonical amino acids can be considered reactive with o3 i e n containing s containing and aromatic sidechains free available bromine fab is a quite reactive oxidant showing reactivity towards alkenes phenols anilines n containing compounds and s containing compounds heeb et al 2014 the selectivity of fab is therefore comparable with o3 however the current available data for fab reaction rates is quite limited and more research is needed fac reacts with most n containing side groups and all s containing amino acids deborde and von gunten 2008 i e 7 out of 20 canonical amino acids and is similar selective as o3 and fab in its reaction with amino acids the reaction of fac with n containing moieties may also form chloramines see chapter 3 2 these chloramines can principally cause further cell damage or reform the original amino acid in a reaction with a reductant see below clo2 is way more selective than oh o3 and fac since it mainly reacts with phenolic moieties aromatic amines and thiols sharma and sohn 2012 hence it may build up high exposures in the endoplasm additionally clo2 probably forms significant yields of fac and chlorite clo2 at the reactive sites in the endoplasm which may increase its disinfection strength see chapter 4 indeed fac and clo2 act together very synergistically since their target structures are nearly complementary only cysteine and tryptophan are degraded by both oxidants the reaction of chemical oxidants with membrane proteins may reduce the biological function by changing e g their quaternary structure in that regard the kind of degradation is very much dependent on the kind of oxidant present due to the different target structures inside the protein 2 3 genetic material reactivity and effect viability the oxidation of the genetic material cf further information in si figure s5 and text s2 can lead to a single base lesion he et al 2019 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 dna double strand breaks fragmentation suquet et al 2010 von sonntag 2006 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and consequently alteration in the supercoiled structure ishizaki et al 1987 sawadaishi et al 1985 if these reactions occur at args these genes would lose their transformation activity due to modification of the chemical structure which means that the args are deactivated it is noteworthy that the deactivation of genes is dependent on the oxidant exposure but independent of the oxidant concentration choi et al 2021 yoon et al 2021 it has been reported that the reactivity of the oxidants towards the amplicon is increasing with increasing length of the genome which can be explained by the increased number of possible reaction partners choi et al 2021 he et al 2019 nihemaiti et al 2020 thereby oh is causing very effective double strand breakage nihemaiti et al 2020 resulting in an instant loss of transforming activity he et al 2019 this high efficiency in double strand breakages is caused by the high reaction rate constants of oh with amplicons he et al 2019 nihemaiti et al 2020 compared to oh the loss of transforming activity was less pronounced in the case of o3 followed by fac clo2 and chloramines he et al 2019 bacteria can initiate countermeasures such as repair mechanisms friedberg et al 2005 which explains why the loss of transformation activity was slower than the corresponding gene degradation nihemaiti et al 2020 however different bacteria have different repair mechanisms this is one reason lag phases and inactivation rates can largely vary for different bacteria or strains table 1 2 and 3 considering that nearly all oxidants also form secondary oxidants table 5 the inactivation mechanisms are very complex and will be discussed for each oxidant in the following chapters 3 free available chlorine fac is the most common disinfectant used for water treatment the inactivation of bacteria and viruses by fac has been proven by various studies de beer et al 1994 engelbrecht et al 1980 floyd et al 1979 le dantec et al 2002 nakagawara et al 1998 nuanualsuwan and cliver 2003 page et al 2010 venkobachar et al 1977 wigginton et al 2012 fac is a selective oxidant that predominantly reacts with amines sulfides activated double bonds aromatic compounds and some inorganic compounds such as reduced iron manganese and dihydrogen sulfide deborde and von gunten 2008 the active agent in chlorination is hypochlorous acid hocl which can dissociate to hypochlorite ocl pka 7 54 deborde and von gunten 2008 the reactivity of the conjugated base ocl is several orders of magnitude lower than hocl deborde and von gunten 2008 hence disinfection and reaction with organic and inorganic compounds become significantly weaker at ph 7 deborde and von gunten 2008 chloramines can be produced by the addition of ammonia prior to chlorination berliner 1931 chloramines have higher selectivity than fac and can be applied in waters that have a strong fac demand and high ph vikesland et al 1998 3 1 reaction with the water matrix the reaction of fac with nom leads to the formation of harmful halogenated organic compounds such as trihalomethanes thm halogenated acetonitriles han and haloacetic acids haa gallard and von gunten 2002 lu et al 2009 richardson et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 besides the formation of harmful halogenated disinfection by products dbps gallard and von gunten 2002 the reaction of fac with specific matrix constituents can lead to the formation of secondary reactive species such as chloramines and fab berliner 1931 farkas et al 1949 chloramine formation is observed in wastewater matrices treated with fac fayyad and al sheikh 2001 although chloramines can be considered a reactive species their inactivation rate is much lower than fac indeed the addition of different amino acids to wastewater to increase the chloramine formation resulted in a decrease in e coli inactivation efficiency fayyad and al sheikh 2001 typical matrices of natural waters and municipal wastewaters contain bromide br and sometimes iodide i gruchlik et al 2014 li et al 2020 magazinovic et al 2004 and the treatment of br and i containing water by fac or chloramine has been reported to increase the cytotoxicity due to formation of brominated and iodinated products criquet and allard 2021 dong et al 2017 indeed fac reacts fast with br and i k hocl br 5 3 103 m 1 s 1 and k hocl i 1 1 108 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 deborde and von gunten 2008 in the case of br the reaction results in fab while i is oxidized by fac to free available iodine fai which is further oxidized to iodate rapidly thus significant fai exposures are unlikely to happen in the presence of fac however chloramines can also form fai but not further oxidize it to form iodate bichsel and von gunten 1999 hence fai is a potential secondary oxidant of chloramines fab reacts fast with amines to form bromamines e g k hobr ammonia 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 heeb et al 2014 however the knowledge about the disinfection strength of fab bromamines and fai is limited cf chapter 5 2 potentially formed free available halogen species can indeed play a role in water disinfection mechanisms the disinfection strength of fab is only marginally lower compared to fac e g 57 µm fac leads to 4 log inactivation of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa after 2 min at 25 c at ph 7 while 52 µm free bromine yield 92 8 and 85 5 inactivation under the same conditions respectively and 3 log inactivation was reached after 4 min wojtowicz 2004 and it is used for disinfection of for instance spa and pool water daiber et al 2016 br and nom concentration in natural waters and wastewater largely varies from a few µg l 1 up to mg l 1 magazinovic et al 2004 formed fab may contribute to the disinfection but also form undesired by products bromate bro3 and halo organic haag and hoigné 1983 fab can undergo reactions with matrix compounds for instance phenolic compounds k hobr phenol 1 8 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 heeb et al 2014 and forms halogenated dbps judd and jeffrey 1995 the formation of toxic dbps is known to be strongly matrix dependent wirzberger et al 2021 the efficiency of bacterial inactivation during the water and wastewater treatment due to secondarily formed fab stills lacks decent investigations recent research indicated that fac could also form hydroxyl radicals oh as another secondary oxidant rodríguez and von gunten 2020 in the postulated pathway fac reacts with hydroquinone hq and forms benzoquinone bq bq reacts with another hq molecule to two semiquinone radicals sq which further reacts with o2 and forms a superoxide radical o2 eventually o2 reacts with fac and forms oh rodríguez and von gunten 2020 intrinsic formed oh might contribute to the inactivation of pathogens chapter 5 3 2 reaction with cell constituents the chlorination of an e coli suspension leads to the leakage of inner cell compounds e g proteins therefore it was concluded that fac mainly inactivates bacterial cells by changing the membrane s permeability venkobachar et al 1977 since fac shows only a low reactivity towards unsaturated fatty acids in the double lipid layer deborde and von gunten 2008 pattison et al 2003 the main target structures are probably in the membrane proteins therefore the reaction of fac with proteins and with amino acids as their building blocks have been widely studied hawkins and davies 1998a hazell and stocker 1993 how et al 2017 hureiki et al 1994 na and olson 2007 pattison et al 2007 tan et al 1987b winterbourn 1985 the reactions of fac with proteins showed irreversible denaturation fragmentation and amino acid cross linking vissers and winterbourn 1991 the latter can be developed either by forming covalent bonds between sulfur and nitrogen of thiol and lysine respectively fu et al 2002 or by the oxidation of tyrosine which leads to the formation of tyrosine phenoxyl radicals which eventually form bityrosines vissers and winterbourn 1991 the primary amines of the free amino acids in general react very fast with fac deborde and von gunten 2008 and lead to chlorination of the primary amine how et al 2017 tan et al 1987b however in the peptide bond the nitrogen atoms are present as amides largely hampering an oxidative attack at the nitrogen jensen et al 1999 thus it is more likely that the reaction of fac occurs at other functional groups of the amino acid side groups such as phenolic groups sulfides primary amines and olefins a case in point is cysteine which contains a highly reactive thiol group that even reacts faster than the free amino group with fac indeed the degradation of the amino group could only be observed after the sulfhydryl group was fully degraded arnhold et al 1991 moreover primary amines also exist in peptides as side groups of incorporated amino acids that also could react with fac lysine in fact amino acids with amine containing amino groups are in excess over sulfur containing amino acids ulmschneider and sansom 2001 winterbourn 1985 therefore it can be assumed that these functional groups are the main reaction partners of fac in protein reactions it was experimentally proven that chloramines are formed during the reaction of fac with proteins hawkins and davies 1998b hazell and stocker 1993 vissers and winterbourn 1991 during the reaction of fac with protein amino groups approximately 20 30 of the added fac is converted to chloramines hawkins and davies 1999 these protein derived chloramines can decompose to form nitrogen centered radicals with diverse follow up reactions such as inter and intra molecular hydrogen atom abstraction and protein fragmentation hawkins and davies 1998b and are thus substantially transformed see fig 4 hence the reaction of fac with amines to chloramines can effectively inactivate pathogens however contradictory to the mechanism reported by hawkins et al protonated amines are less reactive compared to the corresponding neutral species abdighahroudi et al 2022 therefore the neutral amines are the main reaction partners with fac it has been shown that low dosed fac concentrations significantly increased the conjugation frequency guo et al 2015 as mentioned before the application of fac increases the permeability of bacteria by forming more potential pili or pores on the surface guo et al 2015 this causes an easier donation and acceptance of arg during conjugation additionally the inactivation of arb by fac is causing the release of their args which can be easier incorporated by bacteria that are only partly damaged during fac treatment this overall causes the enrichment of args in bacteria after fac treatment jin et al 2020 thus it can be concluded that fac disinfection can promote hgt by conjugation guo et al 2015 jin et al 2020 3 3 reaction with genetic material recent studies provided evidence that fac not only causes protein damage but also damages the genetic material of bacteria a two step reaction model has been postulated for the reaction of amplicons with fac whereby the reversible n chlorination of nucleotide bases is the first step the n chlorination is causing a disruption of the h bonding with the pairing base these bases are further reacting with fac causing irreversible c chlorination choi et al 2021 he et al 2019 it was shown that the kinetic of the irreversible c chlorination is accelerated by higher fac exposures and by a higher abundance of nucleotide bases choi et al 2021 in general the reaction of fac with amplicons is also reported to be ph dependent choi et al 2021 yoon et al 2021 which can be explained by the speciation of fac hocl ocl deborde and von gunten 2008 for e coli inner protein damage cho et al 2010 and a correlation between dna fragmentation and fac exposure suquet et al 2010 were reported the reaction rate of fac with free dna that is not associated with bacterial cells ranges from 3 9 to 9 2 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 he et al 2019 which indicates that the reaction is fast enough to degrade genetic material at typical conditions of water treatment additionally the inactivation of extracted dna from bacteriophages is enhanced with increasing cl concentrations szczuka et al 2022 which might be related to elevated intracellular deactivation of the genetic material as mentioned above the formation of oh during fac based reaction was postulated recently rodríguez and von gunten 2020 indeed yoon et al showed that the degradation of dna segments could be significantly hampered in the presence of t buoh which is a selective scavenger for oh yoon et al 2021 additionally the absence of t buoh caused a conformational change from the supercoiled to the linear form and later also caused fragmentation in the presence of t buoh none of these conformational changes were observed yoon et al 2021 the formation of oh as a secondary oxidant of fac seems therefore very likely the deactivation of intracellular genetic material such as intracellular args is much slower compared to the inactivation of the bacteria itself thus args can still be intact while the bacteria itself is inactivated he et al 2019 this observation is explainable by the fact that fac and its secondary oxidants are much stronger scavenged by constituents of the cytoplasmic matter than the wastewater or drinking water matrix e g by envelope lipids and proteins which largely hampers arg deactivation by fac by reviewing the literature about the application of fac for disinfection dodd 2012 concluded that the deactivation of args might be possible however the required concentration and contact time exposure would be above the upper limit of the drinking water regulations dodd 2012 suquet et al 2010 this is in accordance with more recent results which showed that the required fac concentration for arg deactivation and suppression of arg transfer is significantly higher than that of arb inactivation guo et al 2015 jin et al 2020 this fact can become problematic since fac is known to form harmful dbps rook 1976 the toxicity of these dbps is known pan et al 2014 wang et al 2007 therefore these compounds are regulated in drinking water thus the formation of harmful dbps may indeed limit the application of fac for args deactivation 4 chlorine dioxide clo2 is used as an alternative for fac during waste water treatment processes to avoid the formation of the harmful halogenated dbps formed during the application of fac in water treatment zhang et al 2000 compared with fac clo2 is a stronger disinfectant that does not dissociate and therefore shows higher efficiency in a broader ph range junli et al 1997 clo2 reacts very fast with electron rich functional groups such as activated aromatic systems huber et al 2005 with activated double bonds hoigné and bader 1994 and activated neutral amines in the order tertiary secondary primary amines fig 3 rosenblatt et al 1967 however as mentioned earlier the reactivity with dissociating functional groups is ph depending for example clo2 reacts only very slowly with protonated amines abdighahroudi et al 2022 wang et al 2010 4 1 reaction with the matrix constituents in the water matrix clo2 undergoes reactions with all the mentioned functional groups of the nom of the water matrix this is the main driver of clo2 depletion in the water matrix which is rather slow due to the high selectivity of clo2 hence clo2 can also be applied in waters with high organic matter contents lee and von gunten 2010 apart from direct reactions of clo2 the disinfection may also be controlled by several secondary oxidants table 5 clo2 forms fac in the reaction with phenol and phenolic compounds hupperich et al 2020 rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 therefore the reaction of clo2 with functional phenolic and olefinic moieties of nom is responsible for fac formation during water treatment hupperich et al 2020 the yields of fac by using e g suwannee river natural organic matter srnom vary between 22 and 25 per consumed clo2 hupperich et al 2020 rougé et al 2018 this shows that clo2 based disinfection can include a considerable amount of fac as a secondary oxidant and the secondary oxidants formed by fac as described above fac formation also leads to the formation of chlorine derived dbps however it seems that the formed yield of fac is not high enough to form the known undesired dbps from fac disinfection since no or only low concentrations of dbps are observed during clo2 treatment al otoum et al 2016 compared to chlorination zhang et al 2000 for example the addition of 4 5 mg l 1 fac to 3 mg l 1 doc suwannee river fulvic acid srfa buffered at ph 7 4 leads to the formation of 211 µg l 1 chloroform after five days of reaction time while 6 mg l 1 clo2 lead to only 0 36 µg l 1 chloroform under the same experimental conditions zhang et al 2000 one has to take into account that due to the low concentrations of intrinsically formed fac fac may be consumed immediately by the water matrix however the behavior of intrinsically formed fac in different water matrices is yet not investigated it is conceivable that the reaction of clo2 with the organic matter can be considered pre oxidation which hampers the formation of dbps during the reaction of intrinsic formed fac with doc this is in analogy to ozonation since ozonation also results in a lower dbps formation potential of fac in a subsequent chlorination step hua and reckhow 2013 4 2 reaction with cell constituents although the bactericidal effect of clo2 has been known since the first half of the 20th century ridenour and ingols 1947 the inactivation mechanism of clo2 is not fully revealed the efficiency of the inactivation of e coli by clo2 depends on the disinfection dose ph faster in alkaline media and temperature whereby the latter had the smallest impact ofori et al 2017 the application of clo2 to e coli leads to an inhibition of different enzymes e g dehydrogenase roller et al 1980 β d galactosidase ofori et al 2017 already after a very short reaction time while the cells remain viable furthermore clo2 partially inhibits the protein synthesis of e coli which is proportional to the dose of clo2 roller et al 1980 the inactivation of e coli correlates with the protein release into the bulk solution which indicates that clo2 is also damaging the cell membrane furthermore using transmission electron microscopy tem and a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein assay after 1 log inactivation evidence was provided that clo2 causes damage to cell surface proteins and the cytoplasm cho et al 2010 based on the current state of knowledge it can be stated that the inactivation step which is causing the lethal event is damage of the cell membrane followed by leakage of cytoplasmic material since clo2 is unreactive towards double bonds similar to fac abdighahroudi et al 2021 deborde and von gunten 2008 which are present in the membrane lipid double layer the observed membrane damage may also be caused by the reaction with membrane proteins some amino acids show a significant reactivity toward clo2 jütte et al 2022 tan et al 1987a and their transformation might be responsible for the primary inactivation step during clo2 disinfection although cysteine shows the highest reaction rate among the amino acids towards clo2 ison et al 2006 a significant decrease in tyrosine and tryptophan residues was observed in proteins after clo2 treatment whereby most other amino acids did not degrade significantly ogata 2007 therefore it can be concluded that these residues are the main target for clo2 based oxidation for the proteins albumin and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase of saccharomyces cerevisiae loss of enzymatic activity decrease in α helix content and protein denaturation has been reported ogata 2007 similar results are reported for lysozyme ooi and branning 2017 however until today only a few studies investigated the behavior of bacterial cell proteins during clo2 treatment if the reaction of amino acids with clo2 is considered the primary inactivation step this reaction may lead to the formation of fac which might contribute to the inactivation mechanism indeed possible pathways are postulated stating the formation of fac in the reaction of clo2 with cysteine tyrosine and tryptophan ison et al 2006 napolitano et al 2005 stewart et al 2008 which has been confirmed recently for tyrosine and tryptophan 50 of clo2 jütte et al 2022 note that these amino acids belong to the most reactive towards clo2 noss et al 1986 sharma and sohn 2012 hence it can be assumed that fac is formed inside bacterial cells and may thus enhance the disinfection effect of clo2 4 3 reaction with genetic material the reactivity of clo2 towards genetic material has been barely studied yet even less is known about the dna alterations caused by clo2 recently it has been reported that clo2 causes changes in the conformation and structure of dna zhao et al 2022 when clo2 was applied to haemophilus influenza cells the dna transforming activity was not affected even after 6 log inactivation which indicates that intracellular bacterial dna seems inert toward clo2 roller et al 1980 in general the reaction rate of bacterial args towards clo2 is very slow k ranging from 0 35 1 2 101 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 he et al 2019 however even though the reaction of other constituents would outcompete the reaction of clo2 towards args a very slight deactivation of intracellular args was observed after clo2 addition to a multidrug resistant strain of bacillus subtilis he et al 2019 clo2 itself cannot explain the observed deactivation of args indeed clo2 is not the only present disinfectant as mentioned before taking this into account it becomes clear that the disinfection by clo2 in real water matrices can include 25 fac disinfection hupperich et al 2020 rougé et al 2018 which can improve disinfection additionally fac might be formed in intracellular clo2 reactions see above and could be the reason for the observed slight arg deactivation although the formation of fac with specific reaction partners has been demonstrated jütte et al 2022 the intrinsic formation and the corresponding participation of fac in clo2 based disinfection processes e g arg deactivation has not been reported yet the formation of all possible secondary oxidants formed in the application of clo2 is summarized in fig 5 to this end it can be assumed that clo2 inactivates bacteria by reacting with membrane proteins and cytoplasmic proteins in these reactions secondary oxidants such as fac can also be formed which cause further cell damage eventually including gene damage besides fac the other main transformation product is clo2 abdighahroudi et al 2021 a cytotoxic compound van wijk et al 1998 which could also be formed in the cytoplasm and participate in cell inactivation however reactions of clo2 with organic compounds are barely investigated yet furthermore clo2 is regulated by drinking water guidelines recommended threshold concentration by who of 0 7 mg l 1 guidelines for drinking water quality 2011 which means that the formation of clo2 limits the application of clo2 possible countermeasures are the reduction of clo2 by ferrous salts fe2 or by sulfur dioxide sulfite ion gordon et al 1990 katz and narkis 2001 5 ozone the application of o3 in waste water treatment can be used for the removal of micropollutants lee and von gunten 2012 abatement of taste and odor compounds glaze et al 1990 and disinfection purposes morrison et al 2022 von gunten 2003a o3 has been used for water disinfection since the beginning of the last century and has gained increasing interest after discovering that the application of chlorination may result in the formation of undesired taste and odor compounds and harmful dbps rook 1974 the reaction mechanisms and the application of o3 for water and wastewater treatment have been reviewed frequently over the last decades glaze et al 1987 lawrence and cappelli 1977 von gunten 2018 2003b 2003a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 5 1 reaction with the water matrix constituents o3 is more reactive than the oxidants discussed above which means it undergoes a fast reaction with the water matrix compounds e g nom and is therefore less stable and less selective lee and von gunten 2010 the o3 demand necessary for disinfection is much higher than the demand for micropollutant degradation in fact 108 molecules of o3 are necessary for the inactivation of one bacterial cell von sonntag and von gunten 2012 o3 reacts with matrix constituents in various ways forming several secondary oxidants which can contribute to the inactivation of pathogens thereby the most important secondary oxidants are fab haag and hoigné 1983 and oh von sonntag and von gunten 2012 which are formed in the presence of br haag and hoigné 1983 k o3 br obr o2 1 6 102 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 and organic matter respectively experiments in artificial seawater with high chloride cl and br concentrations showed that o3 is depleted within a few seconds and fab is formed which is fairly stable jung et al 2017 thereby the reaction of o3 with br outcompetes the slow reaction of o3 with cl for the removal of artemia salina during seawater ozonation the degree of inactivation by o3 and fab has been determined to be 51 9 and 6 8 respectively jung et al 2017 thus it can be assumed that fab is indeed playing a role during o3 based disinfection the formation of fac in the presence of cl is less relevant under typical conditions of water treatment since the reaction of o3 and oh with cl is very slow k o3 cl 10 3 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 k oh cl 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 levanov et al 2018 von gunten 2003a and will therefore be outcompeted by other reactions another important secondary oxidant is the oh formed in o3 reactions with organic matter the yields of oh depend on the molecular structure of nom and vary between 15 and 70 per consumed equivalent o3 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the reaction rate of oh is very fast with many matrix components and the exposure is therefore very small thus it seems reasonable that oh is scavenged by matrix components however the reported literature is contradictory in this regard for instance the inactivation of b subtilis was hampered in the presence of t buoh a selective scavenger for oh cho et al 2003 on the other hand the inactivation of e coli in the presence or absence of a different scavenger humic acid is similar hunt and mariñas 1999 the reason for this observation might be that humic acid also initiates oh formation during the reaction with o3 and thus enhancing the inactivation of e coli by oh secondary oxidants are generally formed in drinking and wastewater treatment in the bulk solution their effect on disinfection is often hard to assess since different matrix constituents scavenge these secondary oxidants oh is a very unselective oxidant which mostly reacts with diffusion controlled kinetics resulting in average lifetimes of a few µs buxton et al 1988 this results in a very low steady state concentration of oh pm range and thus in rather low disinfection strength compared to the primary disinfectant and hardly contributes to the inactivation of the bacterial cells hao et al 2012 it is reported that intracellular arg deactivation does not change significantly if extracellular produced oh are scavenged or not choi et al 2021 5 2 reaction with cell constituents compared to clo2 and fac o3 is way less selective lee and von gunten 2010 and therefore has more possible target structures for cell inactivation the o3 attack on bacterial cells has been observed in the cytoplasmic material hunt and mariñas 1999 ishizaki et al 1987 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and the cell wall or membrane cho et al 2010 christensen and giese 1954 girgin ersoy et al 2019 mcnair scott and lesher 1963 thereby o3 undergoes reactions with the double bonds present in the cell membrane pryor et al 1991 which increases the cell membrane s permeability and causes leakage of inner cell compounds mcnair scott and lesher 1963 additionally o3 reacts with different amino acids present in membrane proteins sharma and graham 2010 in the case of amino acids it is again important to mention that o3 does not react with the peptide bond itself cataldo 2006 pryor et al 1984 so only the side chains are available for an o3 attack the oxidation of amino acid side groups by o3 results in a change in the folding and binding ability of the peptide chain cataldo 2006 which may result in a loss of protein functionality the denaturation and thus the loss of the biological activity of proteins after ozonation has been reported before cataldo 2006 zhang et al 2015 the formation of secondary oxidants may also be important in intracellular reactions with o3 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 this could lead to the intracellular generation of fab in the presence of br peroxyl radicals and oh if fab is formed it will react with other inner cell compounds e g amino acids heeb et al 2014 pattison and davies 2004 and might thus increase the inactivation rate of bacteria even though the reaction of o3 with cl to form fac is very slow it might be important in the endoplasmaticum since cl can be present in very high concentrations compared to other cell constituents c cl in e coli 207 41 mm szatmári et al 2020 it is experimentally proven that bro3 formation during ozonation is accelerated if high concentrations of cl are present grguric et al 1994 if fac is formed it can either directly react with vital cell compartments or with br to form fab k hocl br hobr cl 6 84 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 which eventually forms toxic bro3 fischbacher et al 2015 therefore it can be concluded that the high cl concentrations indeed accelerate the inactivation of bacterial cells during o3 based disinfection furthermore the reaction of o3 with cytoplasmic constituents may also yield oh as a secondary oxidant nöthe et al 2009 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the mechanistic pathways and kinetics are already well described von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the formation of intracellular oh seems very likely to accelerate the inactivation of bacterial cells by fast reaction with a broad range of functional groups fig 3 thus damaging inner cell compounds 5 3 reaction with genetic material the main site of o3 attack was already concluded in the 1950s to be the cell surface even though the reaction between o3 and dna containing compounds was also observable christensen and giese 1954 by now many studies have proven that o3 based treatment of bacteria leads to a decomposition of the cell membrane cho et al 2010 girgin ersoy et al 2019 mcnair scott and lesher 1963 o3 also may diffuse into bacterial cells and the average travel distance can be estimated by the mean kinetics and the average travel distance of oh which is 6 9 nm von gunten 2003a the reactivity of o3 is four orders of magnitude slower compared to oh on average therefore it can be estimated that the average travel distance of o3 is around four orders of magnitude longer inside the cell this means o3 has an estimated average travel distance of 60 90 µm considering about 2 µm length of an e coli cell o3 could indeed reach genetic material and react with the nucleotides which eventually results in the inactivation of vital genes and thus cell death the reactivity of oh with args was reported to be very fast k 0 59 2 3 1011 m 1 s 1 he et al 2019 additionally the reaction of o3 with other cell constituents may also form the abovementioned secondary oxidants contributing to the inactivation of genetic material finally the reaction of o3 with the genetic material itself results in the formation of oh von sonntag 2006 in this case oh are formed in close proximity to the genetic material which largely facilitates their reaction with the genetic material since the traveling distance of hydroxyl radicals in bacterial cells is estimated to be 6 9 nm von gunten 2003a it is worth mentioning that oh attack at dna rna is extremely effective in gene inactivation due to string breaking which inhibits transforming activity von sonntag 2006 evidence for the participation of oh during o3 based reaction with dna has been reported recently yoon et al 2021 o3 treatment of supercoiled dna has been reported to cause single strand cleavage of circular dna resulting in a supercoiled structure alteration sawadaishi et al 1985 however this observation did not occur in the presence of t buoh yoon et al 2021 indicating that oh are responsible for the change in the supercoiled structure additionally the reaction rate constant of o3 with args was lower in the presence of a selective oh scavenger choi et al 2021 these findings show that oh might play a role in intracellular args deactivation if it is intrinsically formed it has to be considered that the genetic material is also protected by intracellular structures e g the cell membrane or other cell components which can hamper a direct reaction with oxidants for instance even after 5 log inactivation of e coli by o3 the intracellular args stays intact czekalski et al 2016 an increase in the dosage of o3 would cause several adverse effects such as the formation of carcinogenic bro3 fischbacher et al 2015 von gunten 2003a or n nitrosodimethylamine ndma andrzejewski et al 2008 additionally oh revealed another drawback in args deactivation monitoring the reaction of oh with dna mainly leads to strand fragmentation by cleavage of the phosphate backbone he et al 2019 by shortening the strand the arg transformation activity is lowered however it might be possible that the region of the monitored arg amplicons stays intact which gives a biased result of faster arg deactivation than amplicon degradation he et al 2019 all secondary oxidants which are known to be formed in o3 reactions are shown in fig 5 as well it becomes clear that the synergy of all secondary oxidants together with o3 as the primary oxidant is eventually responsible for bacterial inactivation 6 defense response especially aerobic bacteria are continuously exposed to oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species ros such as h2o2 or o2 forman et al 2009 to encounter ros exposure bacterial cells have developed a defense mechanism in the form of antioxidants such as glutathione gsh it was shown that the production of this tripeptide cysteine glutamic acid and glycine is induced by oxidative stress in e coli and s cerevisiae carmel harel and storz 2000 the intracellular concentration of gsh in glucose fed exponentially growing e coli was detected to be 17 mm which makes it the second most abundant metabolite after glutamate 96 mm bennett et al 2009 thus gsh is in excess over the reactive amino acids e g methionine 0 15 mm tyrosine 0 029 mm bennett et al 2009 and therefore scavenges most of the oxidants and hamper the bacterial inactivation table 6 summarizes the known reaction constants of gsh for the different primary and secondary oxidants that might be relevant during chemical water disinfection the reaction rate of fab has not been determined yet however it can be estimated from the reaction rate with cysteine k hobr cysteine 1 7 107 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 2 7 5 heeb et al 2014 since cysteine is the most reactive moiety in this tripeptide in the case of o3 and fac the reaction rate with cysteine k o3 cysteine 4 2 104 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 pryor et al 1984 and k hocl cysteine 6 7 107 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 deborde and von gunten 2008 is slower or in the same order of magnitude as the reported reaction rate for gsh see table 6 therefore it can be assumed that the reaction rate of fab with gsh is in the same order of magnitude or faster than the reaction rate of fab and cysteine this shows that all primary and secondary oxidants are highly reactive toward gsh and at concentrations in the mm range gsh is probably capable of effectively scavenging most of the disinfectants and their secondary reactive species this may be one of the reasons why disinfectants are typically added in large surplus over potential pathogens von sonntag and von gunten 2012 besides the production of scavengers repair mechanisms have been observed especially for dna damage thereby transforming activity elimination depends on the type of dna repair genes nihemaiti et al 2020 the influence of repair mechanisms becomes clear by comparing the gene degradation and the loss of transforming activity loss of transforming activity is reported to be significantly slower than the overall degradation rate of the plasmid with the same oxidant nihemaiti et al 2020 yoon et al 2021 the combination of repair mechanism and production of chemical scavengers may be responsible for the extremely high number of collisions between bacteria and oxidants 108 in the case of o3 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 until a lethal event happens and the lag phase is observed this number of collisions may be similar or even higher in the case of fac clo2 and chloramines since their inactivation kinetics is similar or slower the stress response is surely way more complex in bacterial consortia biofilms which are hardly investigated 7 additional in vivo effects one must consider that the above mentioned reaction rates do not necessarily apply to amino acids associated with peptides or proteins by investigating the influence of other amino acids in oligopeptides and proteins on the reactivity of tryptophan towards clo2 it was observed that several further factors influence the reactivity under real conditions ge et al 2020 for instance the position of the amino acid in the peptide the accessibility the protein folding and the surrounding amino acid moieties influence the reaction rate the attached amino acids may lead to a shift of the pk a of the reactive moieties which has a strong influence on the apparent second order reaction rate especially at ph 7 additionally the electron density is changed and therefore an electrophilic attack is either accelerated or hampered furthermore the accessibility of the reactive moiety in the polypeptide has a strong influence on the reaction rate ge et al 2020 other important factors for arg deactivation might be the accessibility of the arg on the genome the supercoiling of the dna helix strand and the type of dna for instance it has been shown for extracellular dna that the deactivation efficiency of genomic dna is higher than plasmid dna zhang et al 2019 in contradictory two other studies determined similar reactivity of plasmid borne and chromosomal dna towards o3 he et al 2019 yoon et al 2021 thus it seems very reasonable that all observed in vivo effects are also oxidant dependent additionally it has been shown that double stranded dna is less reactive than single stranded dna toward fac szczuka et al 2022 the deactivation efficiency also depends on the length of the gene since longer amplicons have higher reactivity due to more possible points of attack choi et al 2021 he et al 2019 yoon et al 2021 8 conclusion and further research suggestions based on the current knowledge it can be concluded that all oxidants applied in water treatment also form a different set of secondary oxidants in their reaction with the water matrix and their reaction with bacterial cells see fig 5 all the primary and secondary oxidants might more or less contribute to the inactivation mechanism of cells of different bacterial species although the formation of secondary oxidants is known little is known about their influence on the overall disinfection mechanism therefore it is impossible to estimate the full inactivation mechanism of the primary oxidant at this point further research is necessary about the inactivation in the absence or presence of different scavengers to scavenge secondary oxidants as discussed above the participation of oh during o3 disinfection processes has been shown recently the same procedure can be carried out for clo2 by using e g methionine to scavenge intrinsically formed fac the participation of fac in clo2 based disinfection processes is a very interesting research field however besides the possible formation of fac during the reaction with nom or specific amino acids see above no data is available so far it is crucial to further normalize the available data in the literature regarding the inactivation kinetics of different oxidants on a molar scale this review summarized the available data for the inactivation of bacteria with the oxidants o3 clo2 and fac in water in literature also the molar inactivation rate constants for the inactivation of viruses with o3 are available morrison et al 2022 as shown above the inactivation rate constants can vary strongly regarding species strain or oxidant it would be of great advantage to increase the available data on the inactivation rates in the molar scale which allow the comparison between different oxidants and also will help to improve the understanding of disinfection mechanisms furthermore it allows to predict disinfection of pathogens based on oxidant exposures and thus may help to improve water disinfection processes e g by more precise oxidant dosage furthermore it would be very useful to investigate the exact reaction mechanism of the different oxidants towards dna the reaction mechanism for fac with different amplicons has been described in detail however the available data for other oxidants is still lacking therefore additional data would be of great use for understanding which oxidant primary or secondary is responsible for which part of the degradation or deactivation of the genome it is necessary to investigate further which secondary oxidants are formed in which reactions and determine the yields for instance the formation of fac during the reaction of clo2 with different functional groups of amino acids this might be done by comparing the inactivation of mutated strains of the same bacteria the mutations should be in a way that the results reveal insights in the intrinsic formation and participation of secondary oxidants e g lack of specific defense proteins furthermore as discussed in this review secondary oxidants can form further oxidants which can be named tertiary oxidants this chain of different reactive species gives a very complicated system but also opens a great field of research further in vivo effects should be investigated as well for instance the supercoiling folding extend influence on args deactivation by different oxidants or the args accessibility towards chemical inactivation regarding the location on the genome only if the inactivation mechanisms are fully revealed and understood the oxidant applications can be optimized to achieve an efficient deactivation of args declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts of interest to declare acknowledgement the present study was financially support by

15077,metabolic cross feeding in which species use metabolites of other members to promote their own growth is vital for bacterial growth and survival thus whether the unculturable bacteria can be isolated or purified from consortia by adding these essential metabolites remains elusive in this study mass spectrometry imaging vividly pictured symbionts supplied folate and gluconate to anammox bacteria to support their growth after dosing folate and gluconate the relative abundance and activity of anammox bacteria were substantially improved such enhancement is originated from the added folate and gluconate significantly eased metabolic burden of anammox bacteria as they no longer secreted the extracellular public goods to others for resource exchange during cross feedings on the other hand the decreased supplement of extracellular public goods lead to the decay of symbionts with high demand for these metabolites in the consortia this also deservedly increased the relative abundance of anammox bacteria this study provides a new dimension to isolate specific functional bacteria based on metabolic cross feedings graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cross feedings bacterial abundance bacterial activity anammox consortia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microbes in the microbial ecosystem are all entangled in a specific community through the complex metabolic interaction networks among each other faust and raes 2012 zengler and zaramela 2018 their interactions affect the bacterial behaviors biogeochemical cycle and even ecological equilibrium alivisatos et al 2015 losoi et al 2019 and the researchers have tried to explore the detailed procedures of microbial interactions mainly through culture dependent approaches d souza et al 2018 pande et al 2015 though the culture conditions that include growth medium inoculum size colony density and incubation time have been varied to isolate the bacteria davis et al 2005 only about 1 of microorganism identified to date can be isolated in laboratory pande and kost 2017 herein one of the most important reasons is that biotic positive interactions commensalisms and mutualisms in microbial community will affect microorganisms growth and then hamper the bacterial cultivation epstein 2013 köpke et al 2005 pande and kost 2017 of the obligate positive interactions metabolic cross feeding that microbes exchange the essential metabolites between each other is recently reported to be found in the natural or artificial ecology d souza et al 2018 pande and kost 2017 zengler and zaramela 2018 the exchanged metabolites are costly to synthesis and include amino acids embree et al 2015 sugars lawson et al 2017 b vitamins romine et al 2017 and secondary metabolites e g siderophores d onofrio et al 2010 biotin and pyridoxal phosphate seth and taga 2014 which are collectively called as the public goods since many microorganisms are auxotrophic genotypes to synthesis these metabolites in the nature access to these nutrients is therefore indispensable and the lack of these nutrients thwarts microbial growth pande and kost 2017 zengler and zaramela 2018 consequently it is possible that the uncultured bacteria might be isolated if all the essential metabolites supplied by symbiotic bacteria are added into the medium based on the verification of metabolic cross feeding with the symbionts in fact the isolation chip ichip would allow the target microbes to use the naturally occurring signals or growth factors as the growth medium have been recently used to isolate the microorganisms berdy et al 2017 kaeberlein et al 2002 compared with that the directly dosing of biotic metabolites in the metabolic cross feedings might be a more direct approach to achieve high purityof specific functional bacteria in the consortia which is still in margin anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a nitrogen removal technology with high efficiency which is also energy saving and environment friendly zhang and okabe 2020 though 19 species under 6 candidatus genera of anammox bacteria have been found until now they all could not be cultured in laboratory and always grow with bacteria affiliated to chloroflexi chlorobi and proteobacteria etc zhang and okabe 2020 zhao et al 2018 importantly the metabolic cross feedings in anammox community have been reported kindaichi et al 2012 the symbionts areauxotrophic and unable to synthesize some costly amino acids and vitamins which should be supplied by the anammox bacteria lawson et al 2017 meanwhile anammox bacteria are incapable of synthesizing some kinds of secondary metabolites folate and molybdopterin cofactor and the requirements must be fulfilled by partial symbionts zhao et al 2018 this process significantly contributes to the growth of anammox bacteria strous et al 1999 zhao et al 2018 here mass spectrometry imaging msi was used to verify the cross feedings in via of folate and gluconate in anammox consortia in situ exogenous dosing of folate and gluconate to anammox medium was to analyze potential increase of relative abundance of anammox bacteria in the consortia genome scale metabolic model gsmm was constructed and calculated to analyze the internal causes for the inspired anammox bacteria and the decayed symbiotic bacteria this study not only creates new thought for enhancing bacterial activity but also proposes new concept to isolate bacteria from consortia 2 materials and methods 2 1 batch assays to determine the optimal concentration of folate and gluconate for anammox bacteria the batch assays were performed in 500 ml serum bottles each bottle was inoculated with anammox consortia guo et al 2018 to a final concentration of 1 50 gvss l 1 the used anammoxmedium contained 60 mg l 1 no2 n 60 mg l 1 nh4 nand the other components supplementary methods for control groups cg while also contained folate and gluconate for experimental groups eg in detail the folate concentration of eg was 2 4 7 and 10 mg l 1 in four batch assays respectively the gluconate concentration of eg was 3 5 8 and 10 mg l 1 in four batch assays respectively all treatments were performed in three replicates the vials were made anoxic by purging n2 co2 95 5 gas for 10 min and the serum bottles were sealed tightly with rubber caps to avoid any influent of external oxygen then the vials were settled in a constant temperature incubator stirring at 150 rpm while the culture temperature maintaining at 37 c during the experiment 1 5 ml supernatant was collected from each vials every two hours for concentration determination of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n once the no2 n was degraded completely in cgs or egs it was considered as the end of the batch assays to explore the effect of folate or gluconate on the transcript activity of anammox bacteria the anammox consortia in cgs and egs with optimal concentration were collected for the rna extraction and quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction qrt pcr analysis at the end of the batch assays 2 2 bioreactor operation and sampling two identical sequencing batch reactors sbr with an effective volume of 2 0 l and 0 50 gvss l 1 anammox consortia were established guo et al 2018 the nitrogen loading rates of both reactors were increased while the effluent nitrite concentrations were lower than 5 mg l 1 the sbrs were feed with the synthetic wastewater dominantly consisted of the ammonia and nitrite in the form of nh4 2so4 and nano2 respectively the detail medium components refereed to the previous study van de graaf et al 1996 are presented in supplementary methods additionally 5 mg l 1 folate and 4 mg l 1 gluconate optimal concentration were also added into the medium at the start of every hrt for experimental reactor while the same volume of synthetic wastewater was added into the medium for control reactor both sbrs were stirred at 200 rpm with the magnetic stirrers while the anaerobic conditions were maintained by purging n2 co2 95 5 gas the ph inside the bioreactors was kept in the range of 7 5 to 8 0 though it was not controlled and the temperature was maintained at 37 1 c using the thermostatic water jacket the influent and effluent samples were collected every day and the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were determined by using an apha standard engineering methods rice et al 2012 suspended bacteria samples were collected from two sbrs every 20 days which was for the extraction of extracellular polymeric substances eps and dna the dna was used for the quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction q rt pcr analysis and 16s rrna gene sequencing meanwhile the inoculum samples were also used for cryosectioning electron microscopy analysis mass spectrometry imaging msi analysis and metagenome sequencing 2 3 extracellular polymeric substances eps extraction and determination the eps of anammox consortia was extracted using the cation exchange resin method proposed previously hou et al 2015 the extracellular proteins and polysaccharides were determined by the bca assay osnes et al 1993 and the anthrone method loewus 1952 respectively three parallel samples were determined for each test 2 4 determination of folate and gluconate using hplc ms the concentrations of folate and gluconate in the medium supernatant and disruption lipid of bacterial cell were determined in detail the medium supernatant of control and experimental reactor were collected and filtered using 0 45 μm pore size cellulose acetate filters after 0 1 and 2 h of influent feeding with folate and gluconate addition at the same time the anammox consortia were collected and sonicated with a probe tip sonicator on ice 3 s intervals between 3 s pulses 30 min 30 of maximum intensity scientz jy 92 iin 650 w after centrifugation 10 min at 15 000 g at 4 c the supernatant was collected to detect the concentrations of folate and gluconate in disruption lipid of bacterial cell the folate and gluconate concentrations were determined using the ultimate 3000 uhplc coupled with 8500 tsq

gluconate 2 5 q rt pcr qrt pcr analysis and 16s rrna gene sequencing total genomic dna was isolated from anammox consortia using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s guidelines total rna was extracted from anammox consortia using a ribopure rna purification kit ambion life technologies lithuania according to the manufacturer s protocol then the dna was removed and complimentary dna cdna was synthesized from the extracted rna using fastquant cdna first strand kit tiangen beijing china as microbial genomes tend to be inaccurate owing to assembly artefacts the genomic dna and cdna was used for determining the abundance of anammox bacteria with the specific 16s rrna gene primer pairs by the abi 7500 system applied biosystems ca usa more details about the amplification procedure are described in the supplementary methods additionally the genomic dna was also used for the 16s rrna gene sequencing based on the pcr products of v4 regions of bacterial 16s rrna gene amplified with the primer pair 515f 806r 2 6 metagenome assembly and binning dna of inoculum was used for metagenome sequencing supplementary methods the raw metagenomic reads were initially trimmed by stripping theadaptor sequences and ambiguous nucleotides using seqprepversion 1 1 based on default parameters robbins et al 2011 and the trimmed sequences were quality filtered using sickle version 1 33 based on a minimum quality score of 20 and a minimum sequence length of 50 bp joshi and sickle 2011 contigs and scaffolds were then assembled individually for each sample using idba ud with default parameters peng et al 2012 and the scaffolds generated were binned into the draft genomes based on abundance and the tetranucleotide frequency using the metabat version 0 32 5 with the sensitive model and a minimum contig size of 1500 bp kang et al 2015 checkm version 1 0 7 was used to assess the completeness and the quality of the recovered draft genomes using single copy marker genes that are specific within a phylogenetic lineage parks et al 2015 phylosift version 1 0 1 using collected a set of 37 single copy marker genes darling et al 2014 was used to identify the taxonomy of recovered draft genomes extracted genomes and raw data have been submitted to ncbi to ensure that they are available the detailed accession numbers could be found in the supplementary table 1 the genomes statistics were showed in the supplementary table 2 based on a minimum nucleotide length of 60 the open reading frames orfs of each recovered draft genome were annotated using prodigal version 2 6 3 orfs were then queried against kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway database kegg accessed on august 2017 with the blast e value of 1e 5 2 7 genome scale metabolic models gsmm generation and flux balance analysis fba gsmm is mathematical representation of bacterial genotype which is known as metabolic network it is always used to generate mechanistic predictions of growth and resource allocation based on the cultural media of bacteria pacheco et al 2019 to predict the bacterial phenotypes and metabolic cross feeding in anammox consortia the recovered genome sequences were firstly used for reconstructing the metabolic models using the model seed http modelseed org henry et al 2010 with the template model option of gram negative additionally the parameter media was set referring the anammox medium afterwards each model was imported into matlab the mathworks inc natick ma using the constraint based reconstruction and analysis cobra toolbox heirendt et al 2019 finally the manual curation of models growth rates prediction and metabolic energy consumption of anammox bacteria based on the fba were carried according to the standard protocols 3 results 3 1 in situ observation of cross feedings in anammox community to in situ observe the cross feedings between anammox and symbiotic bacteria inside the aggregation the msi analysis coupled with the immobilization cryosectioning and environmental scanning electron microscopy esem fig 1 a c were manipulated here supplementary methods imaging mass spectrometry ims has been applied to visualize the interaction between pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus frydenlund michelsen et al 2016 wakeman et al 2016 in order to locate anammox bacteria we also carried out msi analysis on the basis of esem combined with genome and genome scale metabolic model to locate anammox bacteria the positions of bacteria in the image were distinguished by the specific metabolites phelan et al 2015 according to metabolic function all bacteria can secrete glycerol phospholipids yet only anammox bacteria can secrete hydrogenopterin and only partial symbionts can secrete folate deduced by genome scale metabolic models and genomes analysis it is the fact that the concentration of bacterial metabolites decreased as the distance due to the diffusion effects jiang et al 2018 thus the distribution of these specific metabolites can represent the distribution of different bacteria jiang et al 2018 wakeman et al 2016 in the same way the locations of citrate homocysteine and gluconate represent the location of all bacteria anammox bacteria and symbiotic bacteria respectively in fig 1d basing on this analysis it was found that the concentration of the two metabolites was higher when they were closer the location of homocysteine and gluconate also follows this rule fig 1b d when they are closer the concentration of specific metabolites of anammox bacteria increases by 1 2 1 5 times in other words when anammox bacteria and symbiotic bacteria were closer in space the folate and gluconate supply of symbionts were increased which inevitably inspired anammox bacteria 3 2 improved nitrogen removal after dosing folate and gluconate for folate addition batch assays the nitrogen removal rate nrr of anammox consortia were significantly increased p 0 05 when the folate concentrations were 2 4 mg l 1 supplementary fig 1 the most significant increase of nrr was found in the folate concentration of 4 mg l 1 p 0 01 the specific anammox activity saa was 5 36 mgn gvss 1 h 1 and 7 73 mgn gvss 1 h 1 without and with folate addition respectively when the concentration of folate is 10 mg l 1 the addition of folate will inhibit the nitrogen removal performance of anammox bacteria which is consistent with the conclusion that high concentration organic matters inhibit the activity of anammox bacteria reported in the literature hubaux et al 2015 jin et al 2012 similarly nrr of anammox consortia were significantly increased p 0 05 when the gluconate concentrations were 3 5 mg l 1 supplementary fig 2 herein the nrr and saa of anammox consortia were highest at gluconate concentration of 5 mg l 1 p 0 01 in a word nrr increased 44 15 and 21 78 while fed with 4 mg l 1 folate and 5 mg l 1 gluconate respectively during the reactor operation 4 mg l 1 folate and 5 mg l 1 gluconate were added into the experimental reactor agreed with the batch assays both the nitrogen loading rate nlr and nrr increased significantly for experimental reactor fig 2 in detail nrr significantly increased from 391 5 mgn l 1 d 1 of control reactor to 554 6 mgn l 1 d 1 of experimental reactor p 0 001 on day 100 namely increased 41 66 fig 2d the saa increased from 76 46 mgn gvss 1 d 1 to 89 31 mgn gvss 1 d 1 p 0 001 namely increased 16 81 it suggested that folate and gluconate addition increased the anammox activity both in the short term and long term culture the effect of folate and gluconate addition on the growth of anammox bacteria was also explored through determining relative abundance of anammox bacteria based on the quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction qrt pcr transcriptional abundance of anammox bacteria was detected by qrt pcr in this study after adding 4 mg l 1 folate and 5 mg l 1 gluconate though the transcriptional abundance of ca jettenia had no significant variation the transcriptional abundance of ca brocadia increased 40 5 and 27 0 compared with the control group respectively supplementary fig 4 the transcriptional abundance of total anammox bacteria significantly increased 27 1 and 15 2 p 0 05 after 10 h cultivation with addition of folate and gluconate respectively it suggested that the addition of folate and gluconate increased the growth of anammox bacteria during the short term incubation to verify the above results and investigate the relative abundance of anammox bacteria affected by folate and gluconate the q rt pcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing were conducted for the control reactor the relative abundance of anammox bacteria increased from 36 94 in inoculum to 56 23 on day 100 fig 3 a importantly there was large succession of community structure in experimental reactor though the relative abundance of ca jettenia decreased 0 69 folds the relative abundance of ca brocadia increased 1 37 folds p 0 05 after adding the folate and gluconate fig 3a more diversified metabolism and higher mobility of ca brocadia than ca jettenia contribute a lot to the higher relative abundance of ca brocadia feng et al 2018 kallistova et al 2021 on the whole the total relative abundance of anammox bacteria increased from 36 94 in inoculum to 66 82 in experimental reactor on day 100 only the abundance of ca brocadia species increased significantly which induced to the increased abundance of total anammox bacteria by 38 82 the net growth rate could be calculated from the increase of the ammonium removal rate in time as μ ln ratet2 ratet1 t2 t1 lotti et al 2014 after calculation the anammox growth rate was 1 83 d 1and 2 14 d 1 on the 50th and 100th days respectively after the addition of folate and gluconate which was higher than 1 25d 1 td 50d and 1 59d 1 td 100d in the control group at the same time the community structure of inoculum and bacterial samples on day 100 were also analyzed through 16s rrna gene sequencing similarly the relative abundance of ca brocadia and total anammox bacteria increased more in experimental reactor the relative abundance of total anammox bacteria in experimental reactor was 71 77 which was 38 82 and 19 27 more than that of inoculum and in control reactor respectively fig 3b meanwhile the relative abundance of dominant symbionts that belonging to the phyla armatimonadetes proteobacteria and bacteroidota all decreased after adding folate and gluconate in the experimental reactor compared to the control reactor 3 3 increased folate and gluconate in anammox cells to detect whether the folate and gluconate were transported into the bacterial cell high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry hplc ms was used for the determination of folate and gluconate concentrations the folate and gluconate concentrations in the supernatant of reactor and disruption lipid of bacterial cell were shown in table 1 interestingly the supernatant of control reactor contained trace amounts of folate and gluconate which implied there were folate and gluconate cross feedings between anammox and symbiotic bacteria in the extracellular space supplementary fig 5 after dosing folate and gluconate into the experimental reactor at the start of the hydraulic retention time hrt the folate and gluconate concentrations in the supernatant decreased constantly from 0 h to 2 h for their concentrations in the disruption lipid of bacterial cell folate and gluconate had the significantly highest concentrations in 1 h after dosing in experimental reactor which were 17 28 folds and 27 06 folds than that in the control reactor respectively it suggests that folate and gluconate were transported into the bacterial cells after dosing to the medium deduced by nitrogen conversion ratio analysis supplementary fig 3 the addition of folate and gluconate did not change the denitrification rate furthermore by adding folate and gluconate it was found that the metabolic energy and growth rate of anammox bacteria increased which proved that it had an important impact on anammox bacteria therefore folate and gluconate are mainly utilized by anammox bacteria 3 4 decreased eps secretion after dosing folate and gluconate to clarify the effect of folate and gluconate dosing on the secretion of extracellular public goods the concentration variations of extracellular protein pn and polysaccharides ps were determined since folate and gluconate were exchanged outside the cell the pn concentration increased from 31 08 mg gvss 1 of day 0 to 47 52 mg gvss 1 of day 100 for control reactor while it had no significant variation for experimental reactor with average concentration of only 8 81 mg gvss 1 fig 4 a similarly the ps concentration increased from 4 28 mg gvss 1 of day 0 to 8 87 mg gvss 1 of day 100 for control reactor while it decreased from 4 28 mg gvss 1 of day 0 to 0 83 mg gvss 1 of day 100 for experimental reactor fig 4b taken together the eps calculated by the sum of pn and ps increased from 35 37 mg gvss 1 to 56 39 mg gvss 1 for control reactor with average concentration of 44 90 mg gvss 1 while it was significantly lower for experimental reactor p 0 01 with average concentration of only 14 63 mg gvss 1 in a word the addition of folate and gluconate decreased the concentrations of extracellular polymeric substance for anammox consortia it implies the exchange intensities of extracellular public goods decreased after adding the cross feeding metabolites for bacterial community 3 5 increased metabolic fluxes in anammox bacteria to clarify the important roles of cross feeding on anammox growth the constraint based reconstruction and analysis cobra toolbox combined with flux balance analysis fba were used to calculate the metabolic fluxes of anammox bacteria using the metagenome assembled genome of ca brocadia detailed statistics were showed in supplementary table 2 recovered from the inoculum these metagenome assembled genomes were checked for metabolic potential through annotation we downloaded the genomes of high quality anammox bacteria from ncbi including ca jettenia caeni bafh00000000 ca brocadiasinica bafn00000000 and ca brocadia fulgida laqj0000000 according to the annotation results we found these genomes have no complete metabolic pathway for the synthesis of folate and gluconate which is the same as the genome we obtained firstly the metabolic model accuracy of anammox bacteria was assessed based on the calculated growth rate of anammox bacteria in different environments on the one hand the growth rate of anammox bacteria was 69 3442 h 1 while reconstructing model using the anammox medium supplementary methods in the anaerobic condition fig 5 a the growth rate of anammox bacteria significantly decreased while decreasing the supplement flux of ammonium and nitrite or changing the condition into aerobic environment through increasing the supplement flux of oxygen or decreasing the supplement flux of carbon dioxide fig 5a the growth rate of anammox bacteria also significantly decreased while increasing the supplement flux of glucose or fructose fig 5a which agreed with the inhibition of anammox activity fed with high concentration of organic carbon tsushima et al 2007 meanwhile the growth rate of anammox bacteria significantly increased after increasing five kinds of amino acids folate or gluconate in the medium while reconstructing models fig 5a herein in accordance with the results of community succession the growth rate of anammox bacteria increased 22 13 and 14 42 after dosing 4 mg l 1 folate and 5 mg l 1 gluconate compared with feeding with anammox medium respectively this simulation is consistent with the experimental results which verifies the accuracy of the constructed models the metabolic model we constructed simulated that the reconstructed model agreed with the metabolic characteristics of anammox bacteria gsmm has been widely used to calculate the minimum atp utilization the maximum metabolic output and the maximum production speed of cells ibarra et al 2002 and it has also been used to study the cross feedings between bacteria for example magnúsdóttir et al 2017 analyzed the metabolic flux and maximum growth rate of two kinds of high abundance bacteria in the flora after cross feedings by building metabolic networks and verified the accuracy of this method through experiments although this method can t fully reflect the situation in real cells it can predict the metabolic changes of anammox bacteria before and after the process of mutualism moreover the prediction results of our model are consistent with the experimental results it was also compared that the variation of metabolic fluxes of nucleotide metabolism pathway that was related with the reproduction rate of anammox bacteria after dosing 4 mg l 1 folate and 5 mg l 1 gluconate into the medium our simulation showed that there were more metabolic reactions with flux increasing compared with the metabolic flux decreasing reactions after dosing the secondary metabolites supplementary fig 6a importantly the average flux of flux increasing reactions significantly increased 28 36 p 0 05 while the average flux of flux decreasing reactions had no significant variation supplementary fig 6b it predicts that the reproduction rate of anammox bacteria increased after dosing the folate and gluconate at the same time the metabolic flux variations of metabolic energy consumption and production reactions were compared after dosing 4 mg l 1 folate and 5 mg l 1 gluconate into the medium our model simulations yield several interesting results the numbers of metabolic flux increasing reactions were more than that of metabolic flux decreasing reactions for major energy consumption reactions such as metabolism of carbohydrate lipid nucleotide amino acids cofactors vitamins and secondary metabolites fig 5b in detail the numbers of metabolic flux increasing reactions were more than that of metabolic flux decreasing reactions for metabolism of amino acids with higher cost carbohydrate b vitamin and ubiquinone supplementary fig 7a c e their average metabolic fluxes had significant increasing for flux increasing reactions while they had no significant change for flux decreasing reactions supplementary fig 7b d f for the adenosine triphosphate atp utilization reactions the average flux of flux increasing reactions increased 25 21 while average flux of flux decreasing reactions only decreased 10 08 after dosing the folate and gluconate according to our prediction results the atp consumption increased 15 13 compared with no addition of folate and gluconate namely the energy consumption increasing after dosing the folate and gluconate importantly the numbers of flux decreasing reactions were more than that of flux increasing reactions for citrate cycle tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation after adding the folate and gluconate fig 5c as the fluxes had no significant difference for both the flux increasing and flux decreasing reactions of energy production this prediction suggested that the dosing folate and gluconate didn t directly change the energy production metabolism the summary of all forecast results shows that the metabolic energy production had no significant variation while the metabolic energy consumption increased for higher activity after dosing folate and gluconate 4 discussions 4 1 inspired anammox bacteria after dosing folate and gluconate this study verified cross feeding in via of gluconate in anammox consortia which has not been reported previously herein we found that the symbionts also could supply gluconate for anammox bacteria besides folate since the folate and gluconate have been detected in the disruption lipid of control reactor meanwhile the assembled genomes of anammox bacteria in this study and deposited in the ncbi genbank all missing the complete pathway for gluconate biosynthesis including candidatus brocadia sinica bafn00000000 oshiki et al 2015 candidatus brocadia fulgida laqj00000000 ferousi et al 2013 and candidatus jettenia caeni bafh00000000 hira et al 2012 importantly the metabolic intensity increased while the anammox bacteria and symbionts secreting gluconate and folate were closer as the folate and gluconate are both important for the growth and reproduction of bacteria in detail folate is the subunit of most metabolites of carbon dioxide fixation of anammox bacteria such as 10 formyltetrahydrofolate 5 10 methenyltetrahydrofolate and 5 10 methylenetetrahydrofolate wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 gluconate is the necessary precursor of d ribulose 5 phosphate a genetic material needed for bacterial reproduction losoi et al 2019 zhou et al 2011 in a word there were cross feedings in via of both folate and gluconate from symbionts to anammox bacteria in the anammox consortia in this study to examine the role of cross feedings in via of folate and gluconate in anammox bacteria the experiments were conducted through dosing the folate and gluconate in the anammox medium during the batch assays the transcript abundance of anammox bacteria especially for candidatus brocadia fed with appropriate concentration of folate and gluconate had a significant increase importantly the relative abundance of anammox bacteria increased 19 27 after 100 days cultivation with folate and gluconate compared with the control reactor which agreed with the co factor role of folate and gluconate in bacterial growth losoi et al 2019 wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 zhou et al 2011 similar results has been discussed that the siderophores from symbionts promoted the growth of uncultured bacteria d onofrio et al 2010 on the one hand the concentrations of folate and gluconate in bacterial disruption liquid of experimental reactor were both higher than that of control reactor and the denitrification activity had no obvious increasing after adding the organic carbon as the nitrite to ammonium consumption ratio no2 n nh4 n and the nitrate to ammonium conversion ratio no3 n nh4 n had no obvious difference in two reactors and were both in agreement with the stoichiometry of anammox reaction during the reactor start up van der star et al 2007 it suggests that the adding folate and gluconate has been transported into the cell of anammox bacteria rather than the symbiotic bacteria though the dominant symbionts are heterotrophic denitrifiers lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 on the other hand the nucleotide metabolism including purine and pyrimidine metabolism were activated as the metabolic flux of these two kinds of metabolic pathways significantly increased after dosing folate and gluconate it illustrates that dosing folate and gluconate led to the increase of anammox bacteria growth as these two kinds of metabolites are used for bacterial replication thompson et al 2016 kallistova et al 2021 evaluated the effects of folate on anammox bacteria and proposed that folate was beneficial to stimulate nitrogen removal rate it had no significant effects on increasing the abundance of anammox bacteria at low folate dosage of 0 2 mg l 1 here our study is the first to claim cross feedings in via of folate and gluconate are important for the growth of anammox bacteria and adding folate with appropriate concentration of 4 mg l 1 can significantly improve the relative abundance of anammox bacteria the above results were also in agreement with that the lack of the vital nutrients inhibits the bacterial growth and division zengler and zaramela 2018 and metabolic cross feeding contributed for the growth fitness of the receptor pande et al 2013 in conclusion the strengthened feedings of folate and gluconate led to the increased purity of anammox bacteria in the consortia during the long term cultivation 4 2 increased metabolic energy supplement in anammox bacteria dosing folate and gluconate also benefited for the supplement of the metabolic energy for anammox bacteria besides the co factor for growth the tca cycle is central to energy production while the oxidative phosphorylation couples with the process of transforming adenosine diphosphate adp into atp for bacteria kwong et al 2017 ludwig et al 2001 after dosing the folate and gluconate the energy production of anammox bacteria had no significant increase through calculating the metabolic fluxes of tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation on the contrary the energy consumption increased significantly as the metabolic fluxes of more atp consumption reactions increased after strengthening the supplement of biotic metabolites according to the gsmm simulation results in the process of model simulation it can be determined that anammox bacteria directly metabolize folate and gluconate which has been widely used to calculate the changes of metabolic flux after metabolic cross feeding zuñiga et al 2019 it was in accord with the increasing fluxes of the metabolism pathways of amino acids b vitamins carbohydrate and porphyrin which exhibits that the higher metabolic activity tang et al 2018 it also agrees with that increased synthesizing intensities of the metabolites while the anammox bacteria were close to the symbionts that could supply folate and gluconate meanwhile it has been reported that the concentration of heme c that is the key component of cytochrome c synthesized from the porphyrin metabolism pathway have the positive correlation with the specific anammox activity kang et al 2020 sinclair et al 1999 the higher activity of porphyrin metabolism was in agreement with the higher nlr nrr and saa of experimental reactor compared with the control reactor in short since the metabolic costs and energy are required for the synthesis of the these metabolites embree et al 2015 zengler and zaramela 2018 the dosing of folate and gluconate also supplied the metabolic energy for the anammox bacteria in short it could be another reason for the increasing of growth rate and purity of anammox bacteria 4 3 declined symbionts stemmed from the eased metabolic burden of anammox bacteria anammox bacteria saved metabolic energy by decreasing the supply of cross feeding metabolites for symbionts after dosing folate and gluconate herein though the metabolic activities of amino acids and carbohydrate increased the concentrations of extracellular public goods including proteins and polysaccharides decreased in the experimental reactor it demonstrates that the anammox bacteria reduced supplying metabolites including amino acids and carbohydrates for symbionts as anammox bacteria had the highest abundance and dominated secretor of eps in anammox consortia chen et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 it has been reported that the bacteria need to make decisions about resource allocation because that some molecules are costly to manufacture such as proteins embree et al 2015 molenaar et al 2009 since dosing folate and gluconate could meet the metabolic needs of anammox bacteria for growth anammox bacteria didn t need the growth factor from symbionts and reduced the secretion of public goods for symbionts the symbionts gradually reduced the supply of this growth factor and no longer got back the costly amino acids from anammox bacteria on the one hand this process benefited for the metabolic energy saving for the growth of anammox bacteria the reallocation of the saved resources and energy into the production of essential metabolites for the growth pande et al 2013 it is in agreement with the increased metabolic fluxes of amino acids carbohydrate b vitamin and porphyrin taken together dosing folate and gluconate not only supplied metabolic energy for anammox bacteria directly but also saved energy and resources for the growth of anammox bacteria indirectly importantly the above process also led to the decreased abundance of symbiotic bacteria it has been reported that the amino acids and carbohydrate from anammox bacteria is essential for the growth of symbiotic bacteria lawson et al 2017 the decrease of these nutrients was unfavorable for the growth of symbionts after dosing folate and gluconate in the experimental reactor since anammox bacteria didn t need the supply of folate and gluconate from symbionts they broke up the cooperation relationship with the symbionts secreting growth co factors for them it agrees that the relative abundance of symbiotic bacteria affiliated to the phyla armatimonadetes proteobacteria and bacteroidota that are the main secretor of folate and gluconate for anammox bacteria zhao et al 2018 decreased in experimental reactor compared with the control reactor in short the strengthening feeding of folate and gluconate also led to the increased abundance of anammox bacteria through decreasing the growth and abundance of symbionts 4 4 new strategy for bacterial isolation scientists have been studying the effective methods of bacterial isolation for a long time bonnet et al 2020 lodhi et al 2018 the microbial richness of the ecology is large whereas the majority 99 of them is difficult to isolate in the laboratory epstein 2013 kaeberlein et al 2002 here we firstly proposed that the uncultured bacteria could be isolated through strengthening feeding process inspired by metabolic cross feeding in bacterial community scientists have tried many kinds of methods to grow anammox bacteria such as using percoll centrifugation strous et al 1999 different kinds of reactors ali et al 2015 kindaichi et al 2007 or immobilization in polyvinyl alcohol sodium alginate pva sa gel beads zhang and okabe 2017 whereas the anammox bacteria are still uncultured in this study the purify of anammox bacteria increased 19 27 by the feedings enhancement of auxotrophic metabolites in other words the anammox bacteria might be isolated if it is known that all the metabolic cross feedings affecting the growth of anammox bacteria in anammox community since many microorganisms in nature are auxotrophic and depended on the symbionts synthesizing all of the vital nutrients for them zengler and zaramela 2018 microorganisms could be grown in laboratory through directionally strengthening the feeding process of metabolic cross feeding consequently this study provides a methodology reference for the bacterial isolation through clarifying the cross feeding networks combining with the metagenomics transcriptomics and culturomics bonnet et al 2020 lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 5 conclusion this study verified the promoting effects of exogenous metabolites in cross feedings on the growth and activity of anammox bacteria and proposed cross feeding was one of the reasons why anammox bacteria was difficult to be isolated addition of exogenous metabolites in cross feedings increased the growth rate of anammox bacteria especially promoted the growth reproduction and metabolic activity of ca brocadia sinica exogenous additives reduced the metabolic burden of anammox bacteria and stopped secreting public goods for others as resource feedback resulting in the decrease of relative abundance of symbiotic bacteria this study provides a new and bright idea for the separation of bacteria from symbiotic bacteria data availability the raw metagenomics datasets have been deposited into national center for biotechnology information ncbi web site under bioproject

15077,metabolic cross feeding in which species use metabolites of other members to promote their own growth is vital for bacterial growth and survival thus whether the unculturable bacteria can be isolated or purified from consortia by adding these essential metabolites remains elusive in this study mass spectrometry imaging vividly pictured symbionts supplied folate and gluconate to anammox bacteria to support their growth after dosing folate and gluconate the relative abundance and activity of anammox bacteria were substantially improved such enhancement is originated from the added folate and gluconate significantly eased metabolic burden of anammox bacteria as they no longer secreted the extracellular public goods to others for resource exchange during cross feedings on the other hand the decreased supplement of extracellular public goods lead to the decay of symbionts with high demand for these metabolites in the consortia this also deservedly increased the relative abundance of anammox bacteria this study provides a new dimension to isolate specific functional bacteria based on metabolic cross feedings graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cross feedings bacterial abundance bacterial activity anammox consortia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microbes in the microbial ecosystem are all entangled in a specific community through the complex metabolic interaction networks among each other faust and raes 2012 zengler and zaramela 2018 their interactions affect the bacterial behaviors biogeochemical cycle and even ecological equilibrium alivisatos et al 2015 losoi et al 2019 and the researchers have tried to explore the detailed procedures of microbial interactions mainly through culture dependent approaches d souza et al 2018 pande et al 2015 though the culture conditions that include growth medium inoculum size colony density and incubation time have been varied to isolate the bacteria davis et al 2005 only about 1 of microorganism identified to date can be isolated in laboratory pande and kost 2017 herein one of the most important reasons is that biotic positive interactions commensalisms and mutualisms in microbial community will affect microorganisms growth and then hamper the bacterial cultivation epstein 2013 köpke et al 2005 pande and kost 2017 of the obligate positive interactions metabolic cross feeding that microbes exchange the essential metabolites between each other is recently reported to be found in the natural or artificial ecology d souza et al 2018 pande and kost 2017 zengler and zaramela 2018 the exchanged metabolites are costly to synthesis and include amino acids embree et al 2015 sugars lawson et al 2017 b vitamins romine et al 2017 and secondary metabolites e g siderophores d onofrio et al 2010 biotin and pyridoxal phosphate seth and taga 2014 which are collectively called as the public goods since many microorganisms are auxotrophic genotypes to synthesis these metabolites in the nature access to these nutrients is therefore indispensable and the lack of these nutrients thwarts microbial growth pande and kost 2017 zengler and zaramela 2018 consequently it is possible that the uncultured bacteria might be isolated if all the essential metabolites supplied by symbiotic bacteria are added into the medium based on the verification of metabolic cross feeding with the symbionts in fact the isolation chip ichip would allow the target microbes to use the naturally occurring signals or growth factors as the growth medium have been recently used to isolate the microorganisms berdy et al 2017 kaeberlein et al 2002 compared with that the directly dosing of biotic metabolites in the metabolic cross feedings might be a more direct approach to achieve high purityof specific functional bacteria in the consortia which is still in margin anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a nitrogen removal technology with high efficiency which is also energy saving and environment friendly zhang and okabe 2020 though 19 species under 6 candidatus genera of anammox bacteria have been found until now they all could not be cultured in laboratory and always grow with bacteria affiliated to chloroflexi chlorobi and proteobacteria etc zhang and okabe 2020 zhao et al 2018 importantly the metabolic cross feedings in anammox community have been reported kindaichi et al 2012 the symbionts areauxotrophic and unable to synthesize some costly amino acids and vitamins which should be supplied by the anammox bacteria lawson et al 2017 meanwhile anammox bacteria are incapable of synthesizing some kinds of secondary metabolites folate and molybdopterin cofactor and the requirements must be fulfilled by partial symbionts zhao et al 2018 this process significantly contributes to the growth of anammox bacteria strous et al 1999 zhao et al 2018 here mass spectrometry imaging msi was used to verify the cross feedings in via of folate and gluconate in anammox consortia in situ exogenous dosing of folate and gluconate to anammox medium was to analyze potential increase of relative abundance of anammox bacteria in the consortia genome scale metabolic model gsmm was constructed and calculated to analyze the internal causes for the inspired anammox bacteria and the decayed symbiotic bacteria this study not only creates new thought for enhancing bacterial activity but also proposes new concept to isolate bacteria from consortia 2 materials and methods 2 1 batch assays to determine the optimal concentration of folate and gluconate for anammox bacteria the batch assays were performed in 500 ml serum bottles each bottle was inoculated with anammox consortia guo et al 2018 to a final concentration of 1 50 gvss l 1 the used anammoxmedium contained 60 mg l 1 no2 n 60 mg l 1 nh4 nand the other components supplementary methods for control groups cg while also contained folate and gluconate for experimental groups eg in detail the folate concentration of eg was 2 4 7 and 10 mg l 1 in four batch assays respectively the gluconate concentration of eg was 3 5 8 and 10 mg l 1 in four batch assays respectively all treatments were performed in three replicates the vials were made anoxic by purging n2 co2 95 5 gas for 10 min and the serum bottles were sealed tightly with rubber caps to avoid any influent of external oxygen then the vials were settled in a constant temperature incubator stirring at 150 rpm while the culture temperature maintaining at 37 c during the experiment 1 5 ml supernatant was collected from each vials every two hours for concentration determination of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n once the no2 n was degraded completely in cgs or egs it was considered as the end of the batch assays to explore the effect of folate or gluconate on the transcript activity of anammox bacteria the anammox consortia in cgs and egs with optimal concentration were collected for the rna extraction and quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction qrt pcr analysis at the end of the batch assays 2 2 bioreactor operation and sampling two identical sequencing batch reactors sbr with an effective volume of 2 0 l and 0 50 gvss l 1 anammox consortia were established guo et al 2018 the nitrogen loading rates of both reactors were increased while the effluent nitrite concentrations were lower than 5 mg l 1 the sbrs were feed with the synthetic wastewater dominantly consisted of the ammonia and nitrite in the form of nh4 2so4 and nano2 respectively the detail medium components refereed to the previous study van de graaf et al 1996 are presented in supplementary methods additionally 5 mg l 1 folate and 4 mg l 1 gluconate optimal concentration were also added into the medium at the start of every hrt for experimental reactor while the same volume of synthetic wastewater was added into the medium for control reactor both sbrs were stirred at 200 rpm with the magnetic stirrers while the anaerobic conditions were maintained by purging n2 co2 95 5 gas the ph inside the bioreactors was kept in the range of 7 5 to 8 0 though it was not controlled and the temperature was maintained at 37 1 c using the thermostatic water jacket the influent and effluent samples were collected every day and the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were determined by using an apha standard engineering methods rice et al 2012 suspended bacteria samples were collected from two sbrs every 20 days which was for the extraction of extracellular polymeric substances eps and dna the dna was used for the quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction q rt pcr analysis and 16s rrna gene sequencing meanwhile the inoculum samples were also used for cryosectioning electron microscopy analysis mass spectrometry imaging msi analysis and metagenome sequencing 2 3 extracellular polymeric substances eps extraction and determination the eps of anammox consortia was extracted using the cation exchange resin method proposed previously hou et al 2015 the extracellular proteins and polysaccharides were determined by the bca assay osnes et al 1993 and the anthrone method loewus 1952 respectively three parallel samples were determined for each test 2 4 determination of folate and gluconate using hplc ms the concentrations of folate and gluconate in the medium supernatant and disruption lipid of bacterial cell were determined in detail the medium supernatant of control and experimental reactor were collected and filtered using 0 45 μm pore size cellulose acetate filters after 0 1 and 2 h of influent feeding with folate and gluconate addition at the same time the anammox consortia were collected and sonicated with a probe tip sonicator on ice 3 s intervals between 3 s pulses 30 min 30 of maximum intensity scientz jy 92 iin 650 w after centrifugation 10 min at 15 000 g at 4 c the supernatant was collected to detect the concentrations of folate and gluconate in disruption lipid of bacterial cell the folate and gluconate concentrations were determined using the ultimate 3000 uhplc coupled with 8500 tsq

gluconate 2 5 q rt pcr qrt pcr analysis and 16s rrna gene sequencing total genomic dna was isolated from anammox consortia using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s guidelines total rna was extracted from anammox consortia using a ribopure rna purification kit ambion life technologies lithuania according to the manufacturer s protocol then the dna was removed and complimentary dna cdna was synthesized from the extracted rna using fastquant cdna first strand kit tiangen beijing china as microbial genomes tend to be inaccurate owing to assembly artefacts the genomic dna and cdna was used for determining the abundance of anammox bacteria with the specific 16s rrna gene primer pairs by the abi 7500 system applied biosystems ca usa more details about the amplification procedure are described in the supplementary methods additionally the genomic dna was also used for the 16s rrna gene sequencing based on the pcr products of v4 regions of bacterial 16s rrna gene amplified with the primer pair 515f 806r 2 6 metagenome assembly and binning dna of inoculum was used for metagenome sequencing supplementary methods the raw metagenomic reads were initially trimmed by stripping theadaptor sequences and ambiguous nucleotides using seqprepversion 1 1 based on default parameters robbins et al 2011 and the trimmed sequences were quality filtered using sickle version 1 33 based on a minimum quality score of 20 and a minimum sequence length of 50 bp joshi and sickle 2011 contigs and scaffolds were then assembled individually for each sample using idba ud with default parameters peng et al 2012 and the scaffolds generated were binned into the draft genomes based on abundance and the tetranucleotide frequency using the metabat version 0 32 5 with the sensitive model and a minimum contig size of 1500 bp kang et al 2015 checkm version 1 0 7 was used to assess the completeness and the quality of the recovered draft genomes using single copy marker genes that are specific within a phylogenetic lineage parks et al 2015 phylosift version 1 0 1 using collected a set of 37 single copy marker genes darling et al 2014 was used to identify the taxonomy of recovered draft genomes extracted genomes and raw data have been submitted to ncbi to ensure that they are available the detailed accession numbers could be found in the supplementary table 1 the genomes statistics were showed in the supplementary table 2 based on a minimum nucleotide length of 60 the open reading frames orfs of each recovered draft genome were annotated using prodigal version 2 6 3 orfs were then queried against kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway database kegg accessed on august 2017 with the blast e value of 1e 5 2 7 genome scale metabolic models gsmm generation and flux balance analysis fba gsmm is mathematical representation of bacterial genotype which is known as metabolic network it is always used to generate mechanistic predictions of growth and resource allocation based on the cultural media of bacteria pacheco et al 2019 to predict the bacterial phenotypes and metabolic cross feeding in anammox consortia the recovered genome sequences were firstly used for reconstructing the metabolic models using the model seed http modelseed org henry et al 2010 with the template model option of gram negative additionally the parameter media was set referring the anammox medium afterwards each model was imported into matlab the mathworks inc natick ma using the constraint based reconstruction and analysis cobra toolbox heirendt et al 2019 finally the manual curation of models growth rates prediction and metabolic energy consumption of anammox bacteria based on the fba were carried according to the standard protocols 3 results 3 1 in situ observation of cross feedings in anammox community to in situ observe the cross feedings between anammox and symbiotic bacteria inside the aggregation the msi analysis coupled with the immobilization cryosectioning and environmental scanning electron microscopy esem fig 1 a c were manipulated here supplementary methods imaging mass spectrometry ims has been applied to visualize the interaction between pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus frydenlund michelsen et al 2016 wakeman et al 2016 in order to locate anammox bacteria we also carried out msi analysis on the basis of esem combined with genome and genome scale metabolic model to locate anammox bacteria the positions of bacteria in the image were distinguished by the specific metabolites phelan et al 2015 according to metabolic function all bacteria can secrete glycerol phospholipids yet only anammox bacteria can secrete hydrogenopterin and only partial symbionts can secrete folate deduced by genome scale metabolic models and genomes analysis it is the fact that the concentration of bacterial metabolites decreased as the distance due to the diffusion effects jiang et al 2018 thus the distribution of these specific metabolites can represent the distribution of different bacteria jiang et al 2018 wakeman et al 2016 in the same way the locations of citrate homocysteine and gluconate represent the location of all bacteria anammox bacteria and symbiotic bacteria respectively in fig 1d basing on this analysis it was found that the concentration of the two metabolites was higher when they were closer the location of homocysteine and gluconate also follows this rule fig 1b d when they are closer the concentration of specific metabolites of anammox bacteria increases by 1 2 1 5 times in other words when anammox bacteria and symbiotic bacteria were closer in space the folate and gluconate supply of symbionts were increased which inevitably inspired anammox bacteria 3 2 improved nitrogen removal after dosing folate and gluconate for folate addition batch assays the nitrogen removal rate nrr of anammox consortia were significantly increased p 0 05 when the folate concentrations were 2 4 mg l 1 supplementary fig 1 the most significant increase of nrr was found in the folate concentration of 4 mg l 1 p 0 01 the specific anammox activity saa was 5 36 mgn gvss 1 h 1 and 7 73 mgn gvss 1 h 1 without and with folate addition respectively when the concentration of folate is 10 mg l 1 the addition of folate will inhibit the nitrogen removal performance of anammox bacteria which is consistent with the conclusion that high concentration organic matters inhibit the activity of anammox bacteria reported in the literature hubaux et al 2015 jin et al 2012 similarly nrr of anammox consortia were significantly increased p 0 05 when the gluconate concentrations were 3 5 mg l 1 supplementary fig 2 herein the nrr and saa of anammox consortia were highest at gluconate concentration of 5 mg l 1 p 0 01 in a word nrr increased 44 15 and 21 78 while fed with 4 mg l 1 folate and 5 mg l 1 gluconate respectively during the reactor operation 4 mg l 1 folate and 5 mg l 1 gluconate were added into the experimental reactor agreed with the batch assays both the nitrogen loading rate nlr and nrr increased significantly for experimental reactor fig 2 in detail nrr significantly increased from 391 5 mgn l 1 d 1 of control reactor to 554 6 mgn l 1 d 1 of experimental reactor p 0 001 on day 100 namely increased 41 66 fig 2d the saa increased from 76 46 mgn gvss 1 d 1 to 89 31 mgn gvss 1 d 1 p 0 001 namely increased 16 81 it suggested that folate and gluconate addition increased the anammox activity both in the short term and long term culture the effect of folate and gluconate addition on the growth of anammox bacteria was also explored through determining relative abundance of anammox bacteria based on the quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction qrt pcr transcriptional abundance of anammox bacteria was detected by qrt pcr in this study after adding 4 mg l 1 folate and 5 mg l 1 gluconate though the transcriptional abundance of ca jettenia had no significant variation the transcriptional abundance of ca brocadia increased 40 5 and 27 0 compared with the control group respectively supplementary fig 4 the transcriptional abundance of total anammox bacteria significantly increased 27 1 and 15 2 p 0 05 after 10 h cultivation with addition of folate and gluconate respectively it suggested that the addition of folate and gluconate increased the growth of anammox bacteria during the short term incubation to verify the above results and investigate the relative abundance of anammox bacteria affected by folate and gluconate the q rt pcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing were conducted for the control reactor the relative abundance of anammox bacteria increased from 36 94 in inoculum to 56 23 on day 100 fig 3 a importantly there was large succession of community structure in experimental reactor though the relative abundance of ca jettenia decreased 0 69 folds the relative abundance of ca brocadia increased 1 37 folds p 0 05 after adding the folate and gluconate fig 3a more diversified metabolism and higher mobility of ca brocadia than ca jettenia contribute a lot to the higher relative abundance of ca brocadia feng et al 2018 kallistova et al 2021 on the whole the total relative abundance of anammox bacteria increased from 36 94 in inoculum to 66 82 in experimental reactor on day 100 only the abundance of ca brocadia species increased significantly which induced to the increased abundance of total anammox bacteria by 38 82 the net growth rate could be calculated from the increase of the ammonium removal rate in time as μ ln ratet2 ratet1 t2 t1 lotti et al 2014 after calculation the anammox growth rate was 1 83 d 1and 2 14 d 1 on the 50th and 100th days respectively after the addition of folate and gluconate which was higher than 1 25d 1 td 50d and 1 59d 1 td 100d in the control group at the same time the community structure of inoculum and bacterial samples on day 100 were also analyzed through 16s rrna gene sequencing similarly the relative abundance of ca brocadia and total anammox bacteria increased more in experimental reactor the relative abundance of total anammox bacteria in experimental reactor was 71 77 which was 38 82 and 19 27 more than that of inoculum and in control reactor respectively fig 3b meanwhile the relative abundance of dominant symbionts that belonging to the phyla armatimonadetes proteobacteria and bacteroidota all decreased after adding folate and gluconate in the experimental reactor compared to the control reactor 3 3 increased folate and gluconate in anammox cells to detect whether the folate and gluconate were transported into the bacterial cell high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry hplc ms was used for the determination of folate and gluconate concentrations the folate and gluconate concentrations in the supernatant of reactor and disruption lipid of bacterial cell were shown in table 1 interestingly the supernatant of control reactor contained trace amounts of folate and gluconate which implied there were folate and gluconate cross feedings between anammox and symbiotic bacteria in the extracellular space supplementary fig 5 after dosing folate and gluconate into the experimental reactor at the start of the hydraulic retention time hrt the folate and gluconate concentrations in the supernatant decreased constantly from 0 h to 2 h for their concentrations in the disruption lipid of bacterial cell folate and gluconate had the significantly highest concentrations in 1 h after dosing in experimental reactor which were 17 28 folds and 27 06 folds than that in the control reactor respectively it suggests that folate and gluconate were transported into the bacterial cells after dosing to the medium deduced by nitrogen conversion ratio analysis supplementary fig 3 the addition of folate and gluconate did not change the denitrification rate furthermore by adding folate and gluconate it was found that the metabolic energy and growth rate of anammox bacteria increased which proved that it had an important impact on anammox bacteria therefore folate and gluconate are mainly utilized by anammox bacteria 3 4 decreased eps secretion after dosing folate and gluconate to clarify the effect of folate and gluconate dosing on the secretion of extracellular public goods the concentration variations of extracellular protein pn and polysaccharides ps were determined since folate and gluconate were exchanged outside the cell the pn concentration increased from 31 08 mg gvss 1 of day 0 to 47 52 mg gvss 1 of day 100 for control reactor while it had no significant variation for experimental reactor with average concentration of only 8 81 mg gvss 1 fig 4 a similarly the ps concentration increased from 4 28 mg gvss 1 of day 0 to 8 87 mg gvss 1 of day 100 for control reactor while it decreased from 4 28 mg gvss 1 of day 0 to 0 83 mg gvss 1 of day 100 for experimental reactor fig 4b taken together the eps calculated by the sum of pn and ps increased from 35 37 mg gvss 1 to 56 39 mg gvss 1 for control reactor with average concentration of 44 90 mg gvss 1 while it was significantly lower for experimental reactor p 0 01 with average concentration of only 14 63 mg gvss 1 in a word the addition of folate and gluconate decreased the concentrations of extracellular polymeric substance for anammox consortia it implies the exchange intensities of extracellular public goods decreased after adding the cross feeding metabolites for bacterial community 3 5 increased metabolic fluxes in anammox bacteria to clarify the important roles of cross feeding on anammox growth the constraint based reconstruction and analysis cobra toolbox combined with flux balance analysis fba were used to calculate the metabolic fluxes of anammox bacteria using the metagenome assembled genome of ca brocadia detailed statistics were showed in supplementary table 2 recovered from the inoculum these metagenome assembled genomes were checked for metabolic potential through annotation we downloaded the genomes of high quality anammox bacteria from ncbi including ca jettenia caeni bafh00000000 ca brocadiasinica bafn00000000 and ca brocadia fulgida laqj0000000 according to the annotation results we found these genomes have no complete metabolic pathway for the synthesis of folate and gluconate which is the same as the genome we obtained firstly the metabolic model accuracy of anammox bacteria was assessed based on the calculated growth rate of anammox bacteria in different environments on the one hand the growth rate of anammox bacteria was 69 3442 h 1 while reconstructing model using the anammox medium supplementary methods in the anaerobic condition fig 5 a the growth rate of anammox bacteria significantly decreased while decreasing the supplement flux of ammonium and nitrite or changing the condition into aerobic environment through increasing the supplement flux of oxygen or decreasing the supplement flux of carbon dioxide fig 5a the growth rate of anammox bacteria also significantly decreased while increasing the supplement flux of glucose or fructose fig 5a which agreed with the inhibition of anammox activity fed with high concentration of organic carbon tsushima et al 2007 meanwhile the growth rate of anammox bacteria significantly increased after increasing five kinds of amino acids folate or gluconate in the medium while reconstructing models fig 5a herein in accordance with the results of community succession the growth rate of anammox bacteria increased 22 13 and 14 42 after dosing 4 mg l 1 folate and 5 mg l 1 gluconate compared with feeding with anammox medium respectively this simulation is consistent with the experimental results which verifies the accuracy of the constructed models the metabolic model we constructed simulated that the reconstructed model agreed with the metabolic characteristics of anammox bacteria gsmm has been widely used to calculate the minimum atp utilization the maximum metabolic output and the maximum production speed of cells ibarra et al 2002 and it has also been used to study the cross feedings between bacteria for example magnúsdóttir et al 2017 analyzed the metabolic flux and maximum growth rate of two kinds of high abundance bacteria in the flora after cross feedings by building metabolic networks and verified the accuracy of this method through experiments although this method can t fully reflect the situation in real cells it can predict the metabolic changes of anammox bacteria before and after the process of mutualism moreover the prediction results of our model are consistent with the experimental results it was also compared that the variation of metabolic fluxes of nucleotide metabolism pathway that was related with the reproduction rate of anammox bacteria after dosing 4 mg l 1 folate and 5 mg l 1 gluconate into the medium our simulation showed that there were more metabolic reactions with flux increasing compared with the metabolic flux decreasing reactions after dosing the secondary metabolites supplementary fig 6a importantly the average flux of flux increasing reactions significantly increased 28 36 p 0 05 while the average flux of flux decreasing reactions had no significant variation supplementary fig 6b it predicts that the reproduction rate of anammox bacteria increased after dosing the folate and gluconate at the same time the metabolic flux variations of metabolic energy consumption and production reactions were compared after dosing 4 mg l 1 folate and 5 mg l 1 gluconate into the medium our model simulations yield several interesting results the numbers of metabolic flux increasing reactions were more than that of metabolic flux decreasing reactions for major energy consumption reactions such as metabolism of carbohydrate lipid nucleotide amino acids cofactors vitamins and secondary metabolites fig 5b in detail the numbers of metabolic flux increasing reactions were more than that of metabolic flux decreasing reactions for metabolism of amino acids with higher cost carbohydrate b vitamin and ubiquinone supplementary fig 7a c e their average metabolic fluxes had significant increasing for flux increasing reactions while they had no significant change for flux decreasing reactions supplementary fig 7b d f for the adenosine triphosphate atp utilization reactions the average flux of flux increasing reactions increased 25 21 while average flux of flux decreasing reactions only decreased 10 08 after dosing the folate and gluconate according to our prediction results the atp consumption increased 15 13 compared with no addition of folate and gluconate namely the energy consumption increasing after dosing the folate and gluconate importantly the numbers of flux decreasing reactions were more than that of flux increasing reactions for citrate cycle tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation after adding the folate and gluconate fig 5c as the fluxes had no significant difference for both the flux increasing and flux decreasing reactions of energy production this prediction suggested that the dosing folate and gluconate didn t directly change the energy production metabolism the summary of all forecast results shows that the metabolic energy production had no significant variation while the metabolic energy consumption increased for higher activity after dosing folate and gluconate 4 discussions 4 1 inspired anammox bacteria after dosing folate and gluconate this study verified cross feeding in via of gluconate in anammox consortia which has not been reported previously herein we found that the symbionts also could supply gluconate for anammox bacteria besides folate since the folate and gluconate have been detected in the disruption lipid of control reactor meanwhile the assembled genomes of anammox bacteria in this study and deposited in the ncbi genbank all missing the complete pathway for gluconate biosynthesis including candidatus brocadia sinica bafn00000000 oshiki et al 2015 candidatus brocadia fulgida laqj00000000 ferousi et al 2013 and candidatus jettenia caeni bafh00000000 hira et al 2012 importantly the metabolic intensity increased while the anammox bacteria and symbionts secreting gluconate and folate were closer as the folate and gluconate are both important for the growth and reproduction of bacteria in detail folate is the subunit of most metabolites of carbon dioxide fixation of anammox bacteria such as 10 formyltetrahydrofolate 5 10 methenyltetrahydrofolate and 5 10 methylenetetrahydrofolate wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 gluconate is the necessary precursor of d ribulose 5 phosphate a genetic material needed for bacterial reproduction losoi et al 2019 zhou et al 2011 in a word there were cross feedings in via of both folate and gluconate from symbionts to anammox bacteria in the anammox consortia in this study to examine the role of cross feedings in via of folate and gluconate in anammox bacteria the experiments were conducted through dosing the folate and gluconate in the anammox medium during the batch assays the transcript abundance of anammox bacteria especially for candidatus brocadia fed with appropriate concentration of folate and gluconate had a significant increase importantly the relative abundance of anammox bacteria increased 19 27 after 100 days cultivation with folate and gluconate compared with the control reactor which agreed with the co factor role of folate and gluconate in bacterial growth losoi et al 2019 wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 zhou et al 2011 similar results has been discussed that the siderophores from symbionts promoted the growth of uncultured bacteria d onofrio et al 2010 on the one hand the concentrations of folate and gluconate in bacterial disruption liquid of experimental reactor were both higher than that of control reactor and the denitrification activity had no obvious increasing after adding the organic carbon as the nitrite to ammonium consumption ratio no2 n nh4 n and the nitrate to ammonium conversion ratio no3 n nh4 n had no obvious difference in two reactors and were both in agreement with the stoichiometry of anammox reaction during the reactor start up van der star et al 2007 it suggests that the adding folate and gluconate has been transported into the cell of anammox bacteria rather than the symbiotic bacteria though the dominant symbionts are heterotrophic denitrifiers lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 on the other hand the nucleotide metabolism including purine and pyrimidine metabolism were activated as the metabolic flux of these two kinds of metabolic pathways significantly increased after dosing folate and gluconate it illustrates that dosing folate and gluconate led to the increase of anammox bacteria growth as these two kinds of metabolites are used for bacterial replication thompson et al 2016 kallistova et al 2021 evaluated the effects of folate on anammox bacteria and proposed that folate was beneficial to stimulate nitrogen removal rate it had no significant effects on increasing the abundance of anammox bacteria at low folate dosage of 0 2 mg l 1 here our study is the first to claim cross feedings in via of folate and gluconate are important for the growth of anammox bacteria and adding folate with appropriate concentration of 4 mg l 1 can significantly improve the relative abundance of anammox bacteria the above results were also in agreement with that the lack of the vital nutrients inhibits the bacterial growth and division zengler and zaramela 2018 and metabolic cross feeding contributed for the growth fitness of the receptor pande et al 2013 in conclusion the strengthened feedings of folate and gluconate led to the increased purity of anammox bacteria in the consortia during the long term cultivation 4 2 increased metabolic energy supplement in anammox bacteria dosing folate and gluconate also benefited for the supplement of the metabolic energy for anammox bacteria besides the co factor for growth the tca cycle is central to energy production while the oxidative phosphorylation couples with the process of transforming adenosine diphosphate adp into atp for bacteria kwong et al 2017 ludwig et al 2001 after dosing the folate and gluconate the energy production of anammox bacteria had no significant increase through calculating the metabolic fluxes of tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation on the contrary the energy consumption increased significantly as the metabolic fluxes of more atp consumption reactions increased after strengthening the supplement of biotic metabolites according to the gsmm simulation results in the process of model simulation it can be determined that anammox bacteria directly metabolize folate and gluconate which has been widely used to calculate the changes of metabolic flux after metabolic cross feeding zuñiga et al 2019 it was in accord with the increasing fluxes of the metabolism pathways of amino acids b vitamins carbohydrate and porphyrin which exhibits that the higher metabolic activity tang et al 2018 it also agrees with that increased synthesizing intensities of the metabolites while the anammox bacteria were close to the symbionts that could supply folate and gluconate meanwhile it has been reported that the concentration of heme c that is the key component of cytochrome c synthesized from the porphyrin metabolism pathway have the positive correlation with the specific anammox activity kang et al 2020 sinclair et al 1999 the higher activity of porphyrin metabolism was in agreement with the higher nlr nrr and saa of experimental reactor compared with the control reactor in short since the metabolic costs and energy are required for the synthesis of the these metabolites embree et al 2015 zengler and zaramela 2018 the dosing of folate and gluconate also supplied the metabolic energy for the anammox bacteria in short it could be another reason for the increasing of growth rate and purity of anammox bacteria 4 3 declined symbionts stemmed from the eased metabolic burden of anammox bacteria anammox bacteria saved metabolic energy by decreasing the supply of cross feeding metabolites for symbionts after dosing folate and gluconate herein though the metabolic activities of amino acids and carbohydrate increased the concentrations of extracellular public goods including proteins and polysaccharides decreased in the experimental reactor it demonstrates that the anammox bacteria reduced supplying metabolites including amino acids and carbohydrates for symbionts as anammox bacteria had the highest abundance and dominated secretor of eps in anammox consortia chen et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 it has been reported that the bacteria need to make decisions about resource allocation because that some molecules are costly to manufacture such as proteins embree et al 2015 molenaar et al 2009 since dosing folate and gluconate could meet the metabolic needs of anammox bacteria for growth anammox bacteria didn t need the growth factor from symbionts and reduced the secretion of public goods for symbionts the symbionts gradually reduced the supply of this growth factor and no longer got back the costly amino acids from anammox bacteria on the one hand this process benefited for the metabolic energy saving for the growth of anammox bacteria the reallocation of the saved resources and energy into the production of essential metabolites for the growth pande et al 2013 it is in agreement with the increased metabolic fluxes of amino acids carbohydrate b vitamin and porphyrin taken together dosing folate and gluconate not only supplied metabolic energy for anammox bacteria directly but also saved energy and resources for the growth of anammox bacteria indirectly importantly the above process also led to the decreased abundance of symbiotic bacteria it has been reported that the amino acids and carbohydrate from anammox bacteria is essential for the growth of symbiotic bacteria lawson et al 2017 the decrease of these nutrients was unfavorable for the growth of symbionts after dosing folate and gluconate in the experimental reactor since anammox bacteria didn t need the supply of folate and gluconate from symbionts they broke up the cooperation relationship with the symbionts secreting growth co factors for them it agrees that the relative abundance of symbiotic bacteria affiliated to the phyla armatimonadetes proteobacteria and bacteroidota that are the main secretor of folate and gluconate for anammox bacteria zhao et al 2018 decreased in experimental reactor compared with the control reactor in short the strengthening feeding of folate and gluconate also led to the increased abundance of anammox bacteria through decreasing the growth and abundance of symbionts 4 4 new strategy for bacterial isolation scientists have been studying the effective methods of bacterial isolation for a long time bonnet et al 2020 lodhi et al 2018 the microbial richness of the ecology is large whereas the majority 99 of them is difficult to isolate in the laboratory epstein 2013 kaeberlein et al 2002 here we firstly proposed that the uncultured bacteria could be isolated through strengthening feeding process inspired by metabolic cross feeding in bacterial community scientists have tried many kinds of methods to grow anammox bacteria such as using percoll centrifugation strous et al 1999 different kinds of reactors ali et al 2015 kindaichi et al 2007 or immobilization in polyvinyl alcohol sodium alginate pva sa gel beads zhang and okabe 2017 whereas the anammox bacteria are still uncultured in this study the purify of anammox bacteria increased 19 27 by the feedings enhancement of auxotrophic metabolites in other words the anammox bacteria might be isolated if it is known that all the metabolic cross feedings affecting the growth of anammox bacteria in anammox community since many microorganisms in nature are auxotrophic and depended on the symbionts synthesizing all of the vital nutrients for them zengler and zaramela 2018 microorganisms could be grown in laboratory through directionally strengthening the feeding process of metabolic cross feeding consequently this study provides a methodology reference for the bacterial isolation through clarifying the cross feeding networks combining with the metagenomics transcriptomics and culturomics bonnet et al 2020 lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 5 conclusion this study verified the promoting effects of exogenous metabolites in cross feedings on the growth and activity of anammox bacteria and proposed cross feeding was one of the reasons why anammox bacteria was difficult to be isolated addition of exogenous metabolites in cross feedings increased the growth rate of anammox bacteria especially promoted the growth reproduction and metabolic activity of ca brocadia sinica exogenous additives reduced the metabolic burden of anammox bacteria and stopped secreting public goods for others as resource feedback resulting in the decrease of relative abundance of symbiotic bacteria this study provides a new and bright idea for the separation of bacteria from symbiotic bacteria data availability the raw metagenomics datasets have been deposited into national center for biotechnology information ncbi web site under bioproject

15078,deposit accumulation is one of the predominant causes of sewer blockage and overflow nevertheless the traditional detection methods are costly and time consuming and the accuracy of the mathematical models for deposit prediction is usually affected by some uncertain factors e g pipe properties and flow velocity of water this paper proposes a framework of global sensitivity analysis gsa to identify the most sensitive indicators for sewer deposit prediction by i developing a data driven bilevel i e catchment level and segment level model to map the relation between input and output indicators and ii employing three different gsa methods namely the morris method sobol method and borgonovo index method to identify the indicators as important or unimportant insensitive the results show that the likelihood of combined sewer overflow occurrences lcsoo pipe age pa and pipe material pm are influential parameters for the thickness of deposits here we pay close attention to the most influential parameters which can help improve forecast prediction accuracy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewer system generalized linear mixed modeling glmm polynomial chaos kriging pc kriging sewer deposits global sensitivity analysis gsa data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the urban sewer network is one of the most important components of urban infrastructure sewer blockages are the main factor affecting the function of the drainage network fontecha et al 2016 the high construction inspection and repair costs of the sewer network make the blockage issue one of the perennial challenges fontecha et al 2016 to effectively prevent sewer blockage and overflows driven by severe rainstorms it is necessary to conduct preventive maintenance to identify and monitor the accumulation of sewer deposits fenner 2000 therefore a deposit prediction model has been proposed to keep sewer pipes operating at an adequate level of service in this study the deposit prediction model uses certain influencing factors to predict the sewer operational condition thus in conducting a literature review on sewer deposit prediction models however the authors discovered numerous studies on predicting the future state of sewer pipes at the individual level e g segment level mohandes et al 2022 montes et al 2021 rodríguez et al 2012 but few pertains to factoring in the influencing factors at neighborhood level despite the fact that a neighborhood level prediction model could be a significant guide in city scale maintenance planning therefore a bi level evaluation model for deposit prediction is proposed in this research there are a few motivations to construct a bilevel prediction model specifically i given the large significant number of underground sewer pipes it would be expensive and labor intensive to inspect each pipe in a city annually the catchment level prediction could be supportive of scheduling of maintenance such as cctv inspection and manual dredging by prioritizing the catchments ii the prediction results from catchment level can serve as input for the segment level prediction model since it can represent some unobserved information contributing to deposits accumulation such as environmental factors including soil condition nearby utilities and activities balekelayi and tesfamariam 2019 and pipes located within a relatively small geographical area are likely to experience comparable effects from environmental conditions balekelayi and tesfamariam 2019 iii to ensure a balanced dataset across all the magnitude of sewer system operational condition providing the model an improperly distributed dataset for different magnitude among catchments may lead to bias during prediction a variety of mathematical prediction models including the regression model chughtai and zayed 2008 the markov chain model micevski et al 2002 and others have been used in the research of this topic given the complexity and variety of factors that leads to sewer blockage statistical techniques are generally recommended and multiple linear regression is widely used in previous studies post et al 2017 this method requires independent variables and normal distribution datasets which are normally not consistent with the data characteristics in deposits prediction model on the contrary there is no obligation for conformity to certain statistical distributions and correlation among variables in the generalized linear mixed model glmm besides glmm has higher accuracy as it can capture more variability when a model is fitted diggle et al 2008 to explore the differences of sewer system general condition among catchments this study intents to apply the glmm to reveal the influence of the catchment level to the thickness of deposits at the segment level the meta model is employed to handle the complexity and nonlinearity of input output mapping in this study liu et al 2023 in contrast to other types of meta models kriging provides not only the predicted value at an unknown point but also the prediction variance which is a built in error measure that makes it easier to formulate learning functions additionally schöbi et al 2015 suggested an advanced kriging method called polynomial chaos kriging pc kriging which combines the regression type pce to capture the global behavior of target computational model and the interpolation type gaussian process to control the local variations therefore at the segment level this study applies pc kriging approach to evaluate the mapping relationship between the features of underground pipe network and the thickness of deposits furthermore in previous sewer pipe prediction models as shown in table 1 to improving prediction accuracy the researchers have included as many input variables as possible when developing their models yin et al 2020 however employing more variables implies that the data collecting procedure cost more efforts besides some variables employed in prediction model may be unavailable for other cases therefore identifying the key input indicators and removing those that contribute less to the prediction performance could be economically and technically beneficial when it comes to developing such a prediction model thus to identify and investigate the key input factors that affect the proposed bi level prediction model performance this study suggests integrating a forward variable elimination process with gsa which is an efficient tool for the evaluation of the impact and interactions of uncertain inputs in complex environmental models nossent et al 2011 pianosi and wagener 2015 this study aims to develop a reliable input output meta model through datasets from two levels i e catchment level and segment level for performing a global sensitivity analysis gsa approach the key contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows i an integrated and universal bilevel framework has been developed for evaluating the existing sewer system operational state from the multi scale point of view ii a credible input output meta model is established through discrete and limited datasets for conducting the gsa approach and iii a reliable gsa framework has been presented to identify the key factors resulting in sewer deposit prediction uncertainty this paper is organized as follows first a generalized linear mixed model glmm is used to predict the likelihood of combined sewer overflow occurrences lcsoo at the catchment level then the lcsoo an output indicator obtained at the catchment level is introduced to the segment level as one of the input indicators second the construction process of meta model polynomial chaos kriging pc kriging is established to explore the mapping relationship between the inputs and the thickness of deposits third gsa is applied to identify the importance of the input factors and their impact on deposit prediction finally a discussion and conclusions are presented 2 materials and methodology the prediction of sewer deposits is carried out according to the procedure described in fig 1 the catchment level containing eleven daily inspection areas has three input indicators hotel and catering services density hcsd nighttime light and tree density glmm is used to map input indicators to 100 binary data points that represent the presence absence of overflow occurrences at the monitoring sites the objective of the first model is to predict the lcsoo at the catchment level since it represents the unobservable variables from a social environmental perspective the catchment level prediction results are used as an input for the prediction model at the segment level the second model of this study is primarily based on the physical properties of a single pipe segment which are the pipe diameter pd pipe age pa slope flow velocity fv buried depth bd liquid level ll category pipe material pm and lcsoo then pc kriging is used as a meta model to explore the mapping relationship between the nine inputs and the thickness of deposits at the segment level at the same time r 2 and root mean square error rmse are used to evaluate the performance of the model and gsa methods are employed to investigate the relative contributions of each input parameter to the output the pseudo code for the proposed method is shown in table 2 2 1 study area the study derived samples from wuchang district wuhan city china covering a total area of more than 55 square kilometers wuchang district is home to a diverse range of business centers residential areas schools hospitals and other institutions providing a rich supply of research data the information was gathered from the daily sewer inspection database which is maintained in close collaboration with the sewerage corporation data at the first level are derived in eleven daily inspection areas resulting in 100 monitoring sites represented by binary data 1 represents the key monitoring manholes easily overflowing due to heavy rainfall and 0 represents manholes operating normally in addition from the most recent annual general investigation of sewer systems the thickness of deposits observed on six consecutive days under the 150 manhole covers are obtained as shown in fig 2 which serves as a dataset at the segment level 2 2 data preprocessing the strong correlation between the input indicators will lead to overlapping input information which comes at the reduction of the prediction performance of the model ke et al 2021 therefore investigating the correlation among input indicators is one of the essential steps before model development this paper uses the variance inflation factor vif and pearson correlation coefficient for correlation tests where vif is an index used to measure the degree of multicollinearity in multiple linear regression models similarly the pearson correlation coefficient is applied to evaluate the correlation degree between two variables 0 65 in this study a vif value less than or equal to 5 is considered a reasonable cutoff threshold bagheri and midi 2009 the approach includes removing the collinearity indicator with a vif value exceeding the threshold and then performing regression analysis again the akaike information criterion aic was proposed by japanese statistician hiroji akaike based on the concept of entropy and provides a scoring criterion for measuring the goodness of statistical model fitting akaike 1998 the aic suggests that when model optimization is involved in the study it is advisable to choose the model with the smallest aic value specifically when the goodness of fit of the model is the same it is essential to represent the model with as few parameters as possible the calculation of vif pearson correlation coefficient and aic are all carried out with the r programming language 2 3 step 1 predicting lcsoo at the catchment level 2 3 1 variable selection for the catchment level model social environment indicators are widely considered to represent the unobservable variables in developing sewer deposits prediction models okwori et al 2021 yin et al 2020 therefore combined with relevant research hcsd nighttime light and tree density are selected for lcsoo prediction at the catchment level 1 hotel and catering services density hcsd the deposits in the sewer system are believed to be caused by the fog accumulation in wastewater discharged from restaurants hotels and other food service establishments nieuwenhuis et al 2018 pulido et al 2019 we estimate the distribution of hotel and catering services per unit area to fit a smoothly tapered surface using the kernel density tool in arcmap in other applications such as traffic accidents and urban potential flooding risk the kernel density method has proven to be effective cherqui et al 2015 in comparison to grid based representations the kernel density method gives a more continuous description even from very large datasets this representation can rapidly and visually reveal hotspots similar to nieuwenhuis et al 2018 the search radius is set to 1 km to obtain the density of the restaurant distribution in the study area 2 nighttime light economic activities will continue to be performed at night in contemporary society and nighttime light provides explicit information on nighttime activity several studies have been conducted to reveal the correlation between nighttime lights and economic development and it has been found that nighttime light can be used as a better substitute for the current representative indicators of urbanization chen et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 the nighttime light data are obtained from the national geographic data center ngdc stable light data are selected which removes short term bright light and the background noise is also identified and replaced with 0 brighter nighttime lights represent higher gross domestic product gdp liang et al 2020 wu et al 2013 and the global nighttime light data are more objective compared with gdp statistics since they minimize human effects 3 tree density tree root intrusion risk is one of the key factors causing sewer blockage since the root will be able to grow into the ground resulting in pipeline deformation the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is used to represent tree density since the study area is one of the central cities in wuhan so the effects of grassland and farmland could be eliminated to the maximum the dataset is provided by the geospatial data cloud 2020 2 3 2 glmm establishment glmm is an extension of linear mixed models to allow variables from different distributions alternatively glmm is also regarded as an extension of generalized linear models e g logistic regression that accounts for both fixed and random effects this model has been widely employed in genetic problems in fisheries population biology and other disciplines evans and holsinger 2012 glmm serves as a statistical approach whose general form in matrix notation is eq 1 1 η x β z γ where x is an n p matrix of the p predictor variables β is a p 1 column vector of the fixed effects regression coefficients z is the n q design matrix for the q random effects and γ is a q 1 vector of the random effects the linear predictor η is the combination of the fixed and random effects in this research hcsd nighttime light and tree density are selected as explanatory parameters and random effects account for individual daily inspection area effects additionally the generic link function a nonlinear mapping of the prediction results relates the outcome y to the linear predictor the logistic link is used as a link function in this study according to a previous study an optimization process for glmm was proposed by diggle et al 2002 it is recommended that all the explanatory parameters be included in the fixed component in the first place after the optimal structure regarding the random component is determined backward selection is conducted to construct the optimal glmm by dropping specific parameters with p values less than 0 05 glmm was carried out using the glmer function in the lme4 package of r statistical freeware version 3 0 2 in a windows 10 computer with an inter core i7 8700 cpu 3 20 ghz and 32 gb of memory 2 4 step 2 predicting sewer deposits at the segment level 2 4 1 variable selection the factors and their frequencies considered in previous sewer deposit prediction problems are summarized in table 1 first the pipe diameter is the most frequently used predictor after that the slope is the second most frequently considered factor followed by fv pl pm bd pa ll and category a higher frequency indicates that the factor is a significant aspect of such a problem since it is commonly used by experts in the field the importance of these factors according to the frequency is not absolute truth however it can reflect the effect of this factor on pipeline blockage to some degree thus the frequency in table 1 will be used as a reference to rank the importance of the factors in this research pd pa slope fv bd ll category pm and lcsoo are selected as input indicators in the model identifying all the relevant components and evaluating them using physical and chemical methods is a compelling way of developing a deposit prediction model and this might be carried out in future studies 2 4 2 pc kriging model establishment 1 universal kriging kriging also known as gaussian process modeling was originally a statistical interpolation approach that uses gaussian processes gp to interpolate complicated functions with a wide range the stochastic algorithm kriging presupposes that the output m x of the model is a realization of a gaussian process indexed by x dx rm eq 2 describes a kriging metamodel 2 m k x β t f x σ 2 z x ω the first term ßtf x includes p arbitrary functions f x and their regression coefficients ß the following term involves variance of the gaussian process σ 2 and a stationary gaussian process z x ω with a zero mean and unit variance 2 polynomial chaos expansion pce pce is a robust metamodeling approach that seeks to provide a functional approximation of a computational model consider the joint probability density function pdf fx employed to describe a random vector with independent components x rm and a finite variance computational model y m x α n m y α ψ α x with y r where ψα x are multivariate polynomials orthonormal with respect to fx α nm denotes multi indices that specify the multivariate polynomials constituents and yα represents the corresponding coefficients 3 polynomial chaos kriging pce estimates the global behavior of y well whereas kriging interpolates the local fluctuations of y as a function of the neighboring experimental design points in eq 3 a more accurate metamodel created by combining the global and local approximations of the two methods is referred to as polynomial chaos kriging 3 y m p c k x α a y α ψ α x σ 2 z x ω where α a y α ψ α x is the weighted sum of orthonormal polynomials the sequential and optimal approaches are the two main strategies to find the effective set of orthonormal polynomials in the pc kriging and the optimal pc kriging is adopted here the sparse set of polynomial bases are determined by least angle regression lar and are then the optimal pc kriging metamodel is then chosen as the pc kriging model that minimizes the leave one out error loo 2 4 3 model validation and analysis rmse and r 2 are employed to evaluate the performance of the model and the calculation methods of rmse and r 2 are shown in eq 4 and eq 5 rmse is used to evaluate the degree of difference between the predicted value and the actual value and r 2 which is a widely used evaluation parameter quantifies the degree to which the model results explain the response variables 4 r 2 t 1 n y t p r e y p r e y t o b s y o b s 2 t 1 n y t p r e y p r e 2 t 1 n y t o b s y o b s 2 5 r m s e 1 n t 1 n y t o b s y t p r e 2 where yt pre and yt obs represent model prediction and observation respectively ȳpre and ȳobs represent the average values of model prediction and observation respectively and n is the total number of paired model predictions and observations 2 5 step 3 gsa construction gsa methods are widely used to investigate the robustness of the prediction model against uncertainty in the input variables borgonovo and plischke 2016 song et al 2015 in this section three different gsa approaches are performed to quantify output uncertainty brought on by input parameter uncertainty for clear mathematical interpretability and straightforward computation the sobol index variance based can be used to directly evaluate the contribution of uncertain inputs to the variance of unconditional outputs liu and ding 2020 besides the morris method is appropriate for any kind of dependence in the input random vector and can be evaluated with a small sample size of the model which is suitable for qualitative analysis campolongo et al 2007 yet in terms of interpretability and ease of calculation the morris method would be suboptimal and the borgonovo index is not based on any assumptions on the dependence structure of the input variables x which makes it applicable in either case dependent or independent input variables borgonovo 2007 considering the complementary advantages of these three methods in gsa sobol index morris method and borgonovo index are conducted based on the daily sewer inspection database then the sensitivity index si is computed to screen out the significant sensitive parameters from the input parameters 2 5 1 morris method the morris method morris 1991 is an efficient screening sensitivity measure that allows for ranking input parameters and seeks to exhaustively cover the input space instead of looking at a single global perturbation it provides a grid where multiple different perturbations are achievable the sensitivity measure is then produced based on the mean and standard deviation of that set of perturbations taking a collection of independent input parameters x x 1 x k the set is then transformed to be uniformly distributed in the interval 0 1 a certain number r of sampling trajectories of k 1 points are generated to vary one input at a time across j levels of the 0 1 input domain starting from a given value of x and taking δ 1 j 1 1 1 j 1 the elementary effect of x i is given by eq 6 6 d i x y x 1 x 2 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k y x δ by sampling multiple initial values of x the distribution of this elementary effect can then be obtained the required sample size of morris model evaluations can be reduced to m 1 r for using a trajectory based sampling strategy where m represents the number of input parameters and r is the number of independent random paths a rough rule of thumb for sample size is that at least 10 n sample points are required to identify key factors where n is the number of experimental parameters levy and steinberg 2010 herein there are nine input parameters to obtain reliable sensitivity analysis sa results the number of independent random paths is taken as 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 and 1000 in sequence hence different training sample sizes are taken as 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 and 10 000 which are more than ten times the required minimum sample size of 90 10 9 2 5 2 sobol method the sobol method sobol 1993 decomposes the variance in the simulation results and estimates the relative influence of each parameter and the interaction between the parameters on the variance of the result additionally it can measure the sensitivity across the whole input space huang et al 2021 according to the sobol method the first order and total sobol sensitivity indices can then be defined concerning the total variance for the output result y jiang et al 2021 7 s j v a r j v a r y 8 s t j 1 v a r j v a r y where v a r j represents the variance of input parameters x j v a r j denotes the variance of all input parameters except x j v a r y represents the variance of the output y the first order index sj represents the fraction by which the output variance would be reduced on average by fixing xj within its range and the total effect stj includes the contribution of the first order effect and the sum of all higher order interaction effects jaxa rozen and kwakkel 2018 in practice monte carlo mc is typically applied to estimate sobol indices azzini et al 2021 in the mc based method the size of each of the samples is generated as r m 2 for a problem of dimension m therefore r is taken as 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 and 1000 in sequence which means that different training sample sizes are taken as 1100 1650 2200 2750 3300 3850 4400 4950 5500 and 11 000 2 5 3 borgonovo index method the borgonovo index δi borgonovo 2007 of a random input variable xi is a measure of the expected shift in the probability distribution of the model output when xi is set to a fixed value if the variable is not important the expected shift is close to zero otherwise it takes a larger value its derivation is not based on any assumptions on the dependence structure of the input variables x which makes it applicable in either case dependent or independent input variables the definition of the borgonovo index is shown in eq 9 where fy is the probability distribution function of the model output and f y x i is the conditional distribution on xi 9 δ i 1 2 e x i d y f y y f y x i y d y it is recommended that the sample size be greater than 1000 for the borgonovo method to achieve converging results marelli et al 2021 hence different training sample sizes are taken as 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 and 10 000 in the borgonovo index method 3 result 3 1 level i glmm at the catchment level 3 1 1 data exploration this section presents the final model selection procedure and two parameters are dropped table 3 gives an overview of model selection process and presents the dropping order of the explanatory parameters pearson correlation analysis is first performed to verify collinearity among five parameters and household density as one of the parameters is dropped since it is highly correlated with population density r 0 76 four parameters population density hcsd nighttime light tree density are then introduced into glmm after glmm completed its first run a group of indexes value vif p value aic are returned since p value of population density does not pass the significance level test this parameter is then removed from glmm although its removal would come at a small increase in aic again the vif p value and aic are calculated one more time to ensure the indexes value fall into valid range at the end the final model with parameters hcsd nighttime light and tree density is preferred as the optimal model as indicated in table 4 notably the vif p value and aic would be calculated again each time a parameter is removed during data preprocessing the vif values of the three variables in the glmm ranged from 1 11 to 1 53 and none of them exceeded 5 which means that the multicollinearity problem does not affect the regression coefficients of the model in addition the p value does not fluctuate much during the procedure 3 1 2 model performance and analysis glmm is conducted in the r package lme4 the following is the final model for estimating the lcsoo in the sewer system 10 η ln μ 1 μ 2 100 1 126 hotel and catering services density 0 747 nighttime light 0 667 tree density γ i γ i n 0 0 020 where γi is the random intercept for inspection area i table 5 presents the estimated regression coefficients for the final glmm the greater the distribution density of hcsd is the higher the lcsoo at the same time considering the impact of tree roots on the pipeline the distribution density of trees is also positively related to lcsoo an interesting phenomenon is that the parameter nighttime light intensity has a negative correlation with the response parameter which implies counterintuitively that the greater the nighttime light intensity is the lower the lcsoo this observation was also confirmed by mattsson et al 2014 and nieuwenhuis et al 2018 as described in the preceding model selection process two parameters household density and population density are dropped ultimately three significant p 0 05 indicators shown in table 5 are used in the glmm to predict the lcsoo in the sewer system the spatial distribution of the three normalized parameters is shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the southern bank of the yangzi river which covers the five inspection areas has a much lower lcsoo however partial regions of five inspection areas of 4 7 8 10 and 11 have a relatively higher overall lcsoo as shown in fig 3 d in which case the presence of an area specific design philosophy is articulated properly the use of random effects reduces the impact of unknown area specific characteristics allowing for accurate conclusions based on the existing data 3 2 level ii pc kriging model at the segment level 3 2 1 data exploration nine indicators are included in the deposit prediction at the segment level and the detailed description and range of each indicator are shown in table 6 variables pm and pipe category are identified as nominal data type yin et al 2020 and there are four types of material contained in pm concrete pvc clay others respectively and three types of pipe category namely main pipe branch pipe others given the small amount of category number of pm and pipe category one hot encoding method is carried out to generate dummy variable by using pandas package of python freeware in addition as shown in fig 4 the functional relationships between the output indicator and input indicators are obviously nonlinear generally the observed deposits exhibited negative relationships with input indicators with the exception of liquid level and lcsoo in certain situations the curves are quite steep some studies have also been conducted on the functional relationship between deposit content and pipe physical properties and their conclusions are also in line with the observations of this research ugarelli et al 2009 tran et al 2010 urban catchments with longer pipe lengths smaller diameters and shallow depths have relatively higher frequent blockage occurrences according to ugarelli et al 2009 it is also concluded that older pipelines are in better hydraulic condition by using an ordered probit deterioration model opdm and a probabilistic neural network deterioration model pnndm according to tran et al 2010 however there are contradicting opinions on the functional relationship between some influencing factors and deposit content the discrepancies may be created by the fact that all of the results are generated from statistical investigation of historical data which could also produce bias while other parameters are considered or a dataset of a different size is employed 3 2 2 meta model performance and analysis 1 deposit prediction performance against different indicator combinations to find the optimal combination of input indicators the possibilities for all combinations are traversed adding one indicator to the model at a time until all indicators are included meanwhile the percentages between the training and validation sets are increased from 0 6 to 0 9 by 0 05 units to create the optimal model r 2 is used to evaluate the performance of each simulation herein the sample set is randomly assigned three times against a certain training percentage and the value of r 2 is the average of three random calculations as seen from fig 5 the value of r 2 increases accordingly as the number of input indicators increases specifically when all nine indicators are included r 2 reaches a maximum of 0 922 which means that the number of input indicators is positively correlated with the predictive performance of the model at the same time as the number of input indicators increases the r 2 value growth slows down and finally shows convergence at approximately seven input indicators conversely the r 2 values increased significantly for the initial combination of one to four indicators additionally fig 5 also shows the comparison of r 2 with respect to seven different training groups from 60 training 40 validating to 90 training 10 validating from which it is concluded that r 2 would not improve dramatically in the case of an 80 training percentage 2 comparison between pc kriging and basic models adaboost and descision trees are used for comparison to demonstrate the performance of pc kriging with nine indicators in order to reduce the contingency caused by a random division we use k fold cross validation to train three models to improve the generalization ability in fig 6 a pc kriging enables to capture the computational model s global behavior and local variations whilst maintaining high prediction accuracy while adaboost and descision trees will overestimate or underestimate the value indicating that the pc kriging method is an optimal meta model as shown in fig 6 b pc kriging achieved the best prediction results with r2 rmse mae and mape values of 0 91 1 59 1 24 and 6 04 and the worst performing model is decision trees with r2 0 75 in fig 6 c the prediction error of pc kriging in the range of 3 15 to 3 25 exceeds 95 obviously pc kriging has exhibited more excellent performance 3 3 gsa under different sample sizes 3 3 1 three different sa methods varying sample sizes may have an impact on the sa results of methods such as sobol and morris according to previous work gan et al 2014 hence to investigate a sufficient sample size and qualitatively analyze the efficiency of each sa method the three methods employed in this research should be compared with different sample sizes it is important to determine the range and distribution of each parameter in gsa research wang et al 2013 because it may affect related parameters such as the main sensitivity index msi and the total sensitivity index tsi bai et al 2019 table 6 summarizes the ranges and distributions of the input parameters the empirical frequency distribution and cumulative probability for each parameter are shown in fig 7 and lognormal and normal distributions are adopted to fit the parameters on the basis of the fitting accuracy we summarize the best fitting distribution mean or ln mean and standard deviation sd or ln sd of each parameter and the input sets for gsa can be generated based on the best fitting distribution 1 morris method to exactly determine the least size of training samples for effective screening different training sample sizes 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 and 10 000 are set for output the thickness of deposits the results of different combinations of training samples are shown in fig 8 where μ reflects the sensitivity of the inputs to the outputs the larger μ is the more sensitive the input is the σ value indicates the interaction between inputs which means that the larger σ is the stronger the input interaction in other words the sa results from the morris method shown in fig 8 are inconsistent and the ranks of μ and σ markedly vary with different sample sizes when the sample sizes increase from 1000 to 10 000 the input with the maximum μ to output is lcsoo the input with the maximum σ to output is pm when the sample size is between 1500 and 3500 for output the sa results which can be inferred by μ and σ become steady fig 8 illustrates that the sa results by the morris method are similar overall when the sample size reached a certain range the sa results were relatively stable so the sample size in this research was set as 1500 2 sobol method the sobol method of mc can also be estimated with different sample sizes in this step the sa results of different training sample sizes 1100 1650 2200 2750 3300 3850 4400 4950 5500 and 11 000 are set for the output parameter as shown in fig 9 overall when the sample size is larger than 5000 for output the rank of sensitive input parameters becomes stable by comparing the sa results from s1 and st the rank of sensitive input parameters exhibits some significant change which indicates that the interaction effect of the input has a certain influence on the output as training sample sizes increase lcsoo is always the parameter most sensitive to s1 for st lcsoo is the most sensitive parameter with a sample size 2500 however when the sample size 3000 pm is the most sensitive parameter fig 9 indicates that the sa results by the mc based method become stable after the sample sizes exceed a certain value which can be set as 5500 in this research 3 borgonovo index method fig 10 shows the borgonovo index s sa results of different sample sizes as the sample size increases the index results gradually become stationary except for the parameter lcsoo the sa results of other input parameters are relatively stable as the sample size increases and the rank of each input parameter does not change much so the sample size in the research is chosen to be 3500 3 3 2 sensitivity analysis result to ensure that the three gsa methods employed in this research can effectively classify the parameters as sensitive or insensitive this section explores the results of these three methods using the morris sobol and borgonovo methods combined with the previous sa results the sample size is selected as the same r 500 i e morris 5000 sobol 5500 borgonovo 5000 to ensure that the calculation results of each method can converge stably to compare the consistency of the three sa results all nine input parameters are shown based on respective sa measures for different methods in fig 11 herein to distinguish the proportion of the si of each input variable to the total si it is assumed that the total si of all input variables is 1 fig 11 shows that the variation trends of the parameter sensitivity of the three methods are relatively consistent overall the sa results of the three methods have a certain reference value for screening out sensitive parameters according to the sa results the top three significant inputs are lcsoo pa and pm for the thickness of deposits to provide a concise summary and quick overview of the models performances a taylor diagram is introduced as shown in fig 12 a according to the ranking of the result of sobol s1 the input indicators are introduced into the model from large to small namely m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m6 m7 m8 and m9 the detail inputs of each model have been shown in table 7 fig 12 a shows that m9 has the highest correlation coefficient and the lowest rmse which indicates that the model containing nine input indicators has the best prediction effect fig 12 b shows the scatterplot of the observation data and the prediction data by m9 the comparison datasets contain training datasets and validation datasets with a training percentage of 80 herein the r 2 values of the training datasets and validation datasets are calculated as 0 9194 and 0 9005 respectively the values of r 2 are all close to 1 which means that the pc kriging model can predict the thickness of deposits with high reliability the black dashed line in fig 12 b means that the observation data are equal to the prediction data and the orange line is the fit line of the training datasets while the gray line is the fit line of the validation datasets the small deviation between the above three lines indicates the good fitting accuracy of the pc kriging model 4 discussion this study sheds light on crucial factors of social environmental and demographic catchment characteristics connected to the lcsoo the first model is composed of three parameters hcsd nighttime light and tree density the high significance of input parameters 0 0090 0 0006 0 0001 shows that specific demographic groups share certain lifestyles environmental conditions and public facilities it is worth mentioning that the results may be expressed differently in the case of other study areas division methods in terms of indicators identified at level ii in this study the input indicators for the second model are pa pd pm bd slope ll fv category and lcsoo compared with traditional monitoring methods the input indicators such as liquid level flow rate material involved in this study are lower in monitoring cost and easier to measure and collect therefore determining a few key indicators to train a model without significantly affecting prediction accuracy is critical this can considerably increase the model s operational efficiency and minimize computational cost it is also worth noting that as a result of the gsa experiment lcsoo is retained for the final model construction in our case study since including lcsoo does contribute to increasing prediction accuracy however given the proposed framework can be generalized for developing prediction models for sewer systems in other cities or even other types of city infrastructure the situation may be different because the model is determined based on historical data for the specific sewer network as a result lcsoo may not be identified as an essential input variable and excluded from the final model therefore it is necessary that the catchment lcsoo serves as the original input for the segment level prediction model according to the experimental outcomes a prediction model with a single input output pattern is insufficient to accurately estimate the thickness of deposits additionally the procedure of increasing the input indicators one at a time and identifying the input combination with the optimal prediction accuracy requires a significant amount of effort and resources alternatively a multi indicator control strategy based on gsa may bring out a collection of input indicators which considerably account for the output uncertainty to construct an optimal prediction model lcsoo pa pm slope pd fv and ll serve as input indicators for deposit prediction as shown in fig 12 a and the prediction performance is similar to those of the nine indications used as input this suggests that the cost of data collection for the bd and category can be decreased the fewest indicators may be utilized to properly predict the thickness of deposits and provide a timely warning of excessive deposit content which is critical to treating or avoiding incidents such as urban sewer network blockage and csos 5 conclusion and further direction the authors proposed a data driven bilevel model to predict deposits in the sewer system and the main contributions are as follows 1 the contribution of the research not only lie in developing a data driven deposits prediction model instead of traditional detection method but more importantly enables a fresh perspective for multi scale i e large scale and individual scale analysis of sewer system that specifically in this case how to quantify and integrate observable and unobservable information from both level into the final prediction model furthermore the proposed method also has satisfactory generalizability that it provides a framework which can be generalized for municipal agencies in other cities to create their own prediction models for sewer systems or other city facilities 2 in this research glmm is first employed to explore the differences of sewer system general condition among catchments caused by specific demographic groups compared to the previous study that mainly focus on individual level analysis the results of catchment level model presented by gis shows the general state of sewer system among different areas which can help managers to identify the critical catchments that require more attention than others then at the segment level pc kriging method is applied to build a meta model to achieve quick predictions in comparison with other meta models pc kriging enables to capture the computational model s global behavior and local variations whilst maintaining high prediction accuracy which enhances the practicability of the meta model 3 additionally this study contributes to the body of knowledge by proposing a procedure that can cope with deposits accumulation uncertainty and support gsa based on given multi scale data source with high reliability and by identifying the crucial deposits contributing parameters in sewer system a feasible preventive strategy for the early warning of blockage has been proposed which could assist the sewerage maintenance departments in developing maintenance plans for dredging work in the sewer systems future research may focus on two aspects on the one hand to explore the chemical composition of sewage in the drainage network to improve the model prediction performance on the other hand to

15078,deposit accumulation is one of the predominant causes of sewer blockage and overflow nevertheless the traditional detection methods are costly and time consuming and the accuracy of the mathematical models for deposit prediction is usually affected by some uncertain factors e g pipe properties and flow velocity of water this paper proposes a framework of global sensitivity analysis gsa to identify the most sensitive indicators for sewer deposit prediction by i developing a data driven bilevel i e catchment level and segment level model to map the relation between input and output indicators and ii employing three different gsa methods namely the morris method sobol method and borgonovo index method to identify the indicators as important or unimportant insensitive the results show that the likelihood of combined sewer overflow occurrences lcsoo pipe age pa and pipe material pm are influential parameters for the thickness of deposits here we pay close attention to the most influential parameters which can help improve forecast prediction accuracy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewer system generalized linear mixed modeling glmm polynomial chaos kriging pc kriging sewer deposits global sensitivity analysis gsa data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the urban sewer network is one of the most important components of urban infrastructure sewer blockages are the main factor affecting the function of the drainage network fontecha et al 2016 the high construction inspection and repair costs of the sewer network make the blockage issue one of the perennial challenges fontecha et al 2016 to effectively prevent sewer blockage and overflows driven by severe rainstorms it is necessary to conduct preventive maintenance to identify and monitor the accumulation of sewer deposits fenner 2000 therefore a deposit prediction model has been proposed to keep sewer pipes operating at an adequate level of service in this study the deposit prediction model uses certain influencing factors to predict the sewer operational condition thus in conducting a literature review on sewer deposit prediction models however the authors discovered numerous studies on predicting the future state of sewer pipes at the individual level e g segment level mohandes et al 2022 montes et al 2021 rodríguez et al 2012 but few pertains to factoring in the influencing factors at neighborhood level despite the fact that a neighborhood level prediction model could be a significant guide in city scale maintenance planning therefore a bi level evaluation model for deposit prediction is proposed in this research there are a few motivations to construct a bilevel prediction model specifically i given the large significant number of underground sewer pipes it would be expensive and labor intensive to inspect each pipe in a city annually the catchment level prediction could be supportive of scheduling of maintenance such as cctv inspection and manual dredging by prioritizing the catchments ii the prediction results from catchment level can serve as input for the segment level prediction model since it can represent some unobserved information contributing to deposits accumulation such as environmental factors including soil condition nearby utilities and activities balekelayi and tesfamariam 2019 and pipes located within a relatively small geographical area are likely to experience comparable effects from environmental conditions balekelayi and tesfamariam 2019 iii to ensure a balanced dataset across all the magnitude of sewer system operational condition providing the model an improperly distributed dataset for different magnitude among catchments may lead to bias during prediction a variety of mathematical prediction models including the regression model chughtai and zayed 2008 the markov chain model micevski et al 2002 and others have been used in the research of this topic given the complexity and variety of factors that leads to sewer blockage statistical techniques are generally recommended and multiple linear regression is widely used in previous studies post et al 2017 this method requires independent variables and normal distribution datasets which are normally not consistent with the data characteristics in deposits prediction model on the contrary there is no obligation for conformity to certain statistical distributions and correlation among variables in the generalized linear mixed model glmm besides glmm has higher accuracy as it can capture more variability when a model is fitted diggle et al 2008 to explore the differences of sewer system general condition among catchments this study intents to apply the glmm to reveal the influence of the catchment level to the thickness of deposits at the segment level the meta model is employed to handle the complexity and nonlinearity of input output mapping in this study liu et al 2023 in contrast to other types of meta models kriging provides not only the predicted value at an unknown point but also the prediction variance which is a built in error measure that makes it easier to formulate learning functions additionally schöbi et al 2015 suggested an advanced kriging method called polynomial chaos kriging pc kriging which combines the regression type pce to capture the global behavior of target computational model and the interpolation type gaussian process to control the local variations therefore at the segment level this study applies pc kriging approach to evaluate the mapping relationship between the features of underground pipe network and the thickness of deposits furthermore in previous sewer pipe prediction models as shown in table 1 to improving prediction accuracy the researchers have included as many input variables as possible when developing their models yin et al 2020 however employing more variables implies that the data collecting procedure cost more efforts besides some variables employed in prediction model may be unavailable for other cases therefore identifying the key input indicators and removing those that contribute less to the prediction performance could be economically and technically beneficial when it comes to developing such a prediction model thus to identify and investigate the key input factors that affect the proposed bi level prediction model performance this study suggests integrating a forward variable elimination process with gsa which is an efficient tool for the evaluation of the impact and interactions of uncertain inputs in complex environmental models nossent et al 2011 pianosi and wagener 2015 this study aims to develop a reliable input output meta model through datasets from two levels i e catchment level and segment level for performing a global sensitivity analysis gsa approach the key contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows i an integrated and universal bilevel framework has been developed for evaluating the existing sewer system operational state from the multi scale point of view ii a credible input output meta model is established through discrete and limited datasets for conducting the gsa approach and iii a reliable gsa framework has been presented to identify the key factors resulting in sewer deposit prediction uncertainty this paper is organized as follows first a generalized linear mixed model glmm is used to predict the likelihood of combined sewer overflow occurrences lcsoo at the catchment level then the lcsoo an output indicator obtained at the catchment level is introduced to the segment level as one of the input indicators second the construction process of meta model polynomial chaos kriging pc kriging is established to explore the mapping relationship between the inputs and the thickness of deposits third gsa is applied to identify the importance of the input factors and their impact on deposit prediction finally a discussion and conclusions are presented 2 materials and methodology the prediction of sewer deposits is carried out according to the procedure described in fig 1 the catchment level containing eleven daily inspection areas has three input indicators hotel and catering services density hcsd nighttime light and tree density glmm is used to map input indicators to 100 binary data points that represent the presence absence of overflow occurrences at the monitoring sites the objective of the first model is to predict the lcsoo at the catchment level since it represents the unobservable variables from a social environmental perspective the catchment level prediction results are used as an input for the prediction model at the segment level the second model of this study is primarily based on the physical properties of a single pipe segment which are the pipe diameter pd pipe age pa slope flow velocity fv buried depth bd liquid level ll category pipe material pm and lcsoo then pc kriging is used as a meta model to explore the mapping relationship between the nine inputs and the thickness of deposits at the segment level at the same time r 2 and root mean square error rmse are used to evaluate the performance of the model and gsa methods are employed to investigate the relative contributions of each input parameter to the output the pseudo code for the proposed method is shown in table 2 2 1 study area the study derived samples from wuchang district wuhan city china covering a total area of more than 55 square kilometers wuchang district is home to a diverse range of business centers residential areas schools hospitals and other institutions providing a rich supply of research data the information was gathered from the daily sewer inspection database which is maintained in close collaboration with the sewerage corporation data at the first level are derived in eleven daily inspection areas resulting in 100 monitoring sites represented by binary data 1 represents the key monitoring manholes easily overflowing due to heavy rainfall and 0 represents manholes operating normally in addition from the most recent annual general investigation of sewer systems the thickness of deposits observed on six consecutive days under the 150 manhole covers are obtained as shown in fig 2 which serves as a dataset at the segment level 2 2 data preprocessing the strong correlation between the input indicators will lead to overlapping input information which comes at the reduction of the prediction performance of the model ke et al 2021 therefore investigating the correlation among input indicators is one of the essential steps before model development this paper uses the variance inflation factor vif and pearson correlation coefficient for correlation tests where vif is an index used to measure the degree of multicollinearity in multiple linear regression models similarly the pearson correlation coefficient is applied to evaluate the correlation degree between two variables 0 65 in this study a vif value less than or equal to 5 is considered a reasonable cutoff threshold bagheri and midi 2009 the approach includes removing the collinearity indicator with a vif value exceeding the threshold and then performing regression analysis again the akaike information criterion aic was proposed by japanese statistician hiroji akaike based on the concept of entropy and provides a scoring criterion for measuring the goodness of statistical model fitting akaike 1998 the aic suggests that when model optimization is involved in the study it is advisable to choose the model with the smallest aic value specifically when the goodness of fit of the model is the same it is essential to represent the model with as few parameters as possible the calculation of vif pearson correlation coefficient and aic are all carried out with the r programming language 2 3 step 1 predicting lcsoo at the catchment level 2 3 1 variable selection for the catchment level model social environment indicators are widely considered to represent the unobservable variables in developing sewer deposits prediction models okwori et al 2021 yin et al 2020 therefore combined with relevant research hcsd nighttime light and tree density are selected for lcsoo prediction at the catchment level 1 hotel and catering services density hcsd the deposits in the sewer system are believed to be caused by the fog accumulation in wastewater discharged from restaurants hotels and other food service establishments nieuwenhuis et al 2018 pulido et al 2019 we estimate the distribution of hotel and catering services per unit area to fit a smoothly tapered surface using the kernel density tool in arcmap in other applications such as traffic accidents and urban potential flooding risk the kernel density method has proven to be effective cherqui et al 2015 in comparison to grid based representations the kernel density method gives a more continuous description even from very large datasets this representation can rapidly and visually reveal hotspots similar to nieuwenhuis et al 2018 the search radius is set to 1 km to obtain the density of the restaurant distribution in the study area 2 nighttime light economic activities will continue to be performed at night in contemporary society and nighttime light provides explicit information on nighttime activity several studies have been conducted to reveal the correlation between nighttime lights and economic development and it has been found that nighttime light can be used as a better substitute for the current representative indicators of urbanization chen et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 the nighttime light data are obtained from the national geographic data center ngdc stable light data are selected which removes short term bright light and the background noise is also identified and replaced with 0 brighter nighttime lights represent higher gross domestic product gdp liang et al 2020 wu et al 2013 and the global nighttime light data are more objective compared with gdp statistics since they minimize human effects 3 tree density tree root intrusion risk is one of the key factors causing sewer blockage since the root will be able to grow into the ground resulting in pipeline deformation the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is used to represent tree density since the study area is one of the central cities in wuhan so the effects of grassland and farmland could be eliminated to the maximum the dataset is provided by the geospatial data cloud 2020 2 3 2 glmm establishment glmm is an extension of linear mixed models to allow variables from different distributions alternatively glmm is also regarded as an extension of generalized linear models e g logistic regression that accounts for both fixed and random effects this model has been widely employed in genetic problems in fisheries population biology and other disciplines evans and holsinger 2012 glmm serves as a statistical approach whose general form in matrix notation is eq 1 1 η x β z γ where x is an n p matrix of the p predictor variables β is a p 1 column vector of the fixed effects regression coefficients z is the n q design matrix for the q random effects and γ is a q 1 vector of the random effects the linear predictor η is the combination of the fixed and random effects in this research hcsd nighttime light and tree density are selected as explanatory parameters and random effects account for individual daily inspection area effects additionally the generic link function a nonlinear mapping of the prediction results relates the outcome y to the linear predictor the logistic link is used as a link function in this study according to a previous study an optimization process for glmm was proposed by diggle et al 2002 it is recommended that all the explanatory parameters be included in the fixed component in the first place after the optimal structure regarding the random component is determined backward selection is conducted to construct the optimal glmm by dropping specific parameters with p values less than 0 05 glmm was carried out using the glmer function in the lme4 package of r statistical freeware version 3 0 2 in a windows 10 computer with an inter core i7 8700 cpu 3 20 ghz and 32 gb of memory 2 4 step 2 predicting sewer deposits at the segment level 2 4 1 variable selection the factors and their frequencies considered in previous sewer deposit prediction problems are summarized in table 1 first the pipe diameter is the most frequently used predictor after that the slope is the second most frequently considered factor followed by fv pl pm bd pa ll and category a higher frequency indicates that the factor is a significant aspect of such a problem since it is commonly used by experts in the field the importance of these factors according to the frequency is not absolute truth however it can reflect the effect of this factor on pipeline blockage to some degree thus the frequency in table 1 will be used as a reference to rank the importance of the factors in this research pd pa slope fv bd ll category pm and lcsoo are selected as input indicators in the model identifying all the relevant components and evaluating them using physical and chemical methods is a compelling way of developing a deposit prediction model and this might be carried out in future studies 2 4 2 pc kriging model establishment 1 universal kriging kriging also known as gaussian process modeling was originally a statistical interpolation approach that uses gaussian processes gp to interpolate complicated functions with a wide range the stochastic algorithm kriging presupposes that the output m x of the model is a realization of a gaussian process indexed by x dx rm eq 2 describes a kriging metamodel 2 m k x β t f x σ 2 z x ω the first term ßtf x includes p arbitrary functions f x and their regression coefficients ß the following term involves variance of the gaussian process σ 2 and a stationary gaussian process z x ω with a zero mean and unit variance 2 polynomial chaos expansion pce pce is a robust metamodeling approach that seeks to provide a functional approximation of a computational model consider the joint probability density function pdf fx employed to describe a random vector with independent components x rm and a finite variance computational model y m x α n m y α ψ α x with y r where ψα x are multivariate polynomials orthonormal with respect to fx α nm denotes multi indices that specify the multivariate polynomials constituents and yα represents the corresponding coefficients 3 polynomial chaos kriging pce estimates the global behavior of y well whereas kriging interpolates the local fluctuations of y as a function of the neighboring experimental design points in eq 3 a more accurate metamodel created by combining the global and local approximations of the two methods is referred to as polynomial chaos kriging 3 y m p c k x α a y α ψ α x σ 2 z x ω where α a y α ψ α x is the weighted sum of orthonormal polynomials the sequential and optimal approaches are the two main strategies to find the effective set of orthonormal polynomials in the pc kriging and the optimal pc kriging is adopted here the sparse set of polynomial bases are determined by least angle regression lar and are then the optimal pc kriging metamodel is then chosen as the pc kriging model that minimizes the leave one out error loo 2 4 3 model validation and analysis rmse and r 2 are employed to evaluate the performance of the model and the calculation methods of rmse and r 2 are shown in eq 4 and eq 5 rmse is used to evaluate the degree of difference between the predicted value and the actual value and r 2 which is a widely used evaluation parameter quantifies the degree to which the model results explain the response variables 4 r 2 t 1 n y t p r e y p r e y t o b s y o b s 2 t 1 n y t p r e y p r e 2 t 1 n y t o b s y o b s 2 5 r m s e 1 n t 1 n y t o b s y t p r e 2 where yt pre and yt obs represent model prediction and observation respectively ȳpre and ȳobs represent the average values of model prediction and observation respectively and n is the total number of paired model predictions and observations 2 5 step 3 gsa construction gsa methods are widely used to investigate the robustness of the prediction model against uncertainty in the input variables borgonovo and plischke 2016 song et al 2015 in this section three different gsa approaches are performed to quantify output uncertainty brought on by input parameter uncertainty for clear mathematical interpretability and straightforward computation the sobol index variance based can be used to directly evaluate the contribution of uncertain inputs to the variance of unconditional outputs liu and ding 2020 besides the morris method is appropriate for any kind of dependence in the input random vector and can be evaluated with a small sample size of the model which is suitable for qualitative analysis campolongo et al 2007 yet in terms of interpretability and ease of calculation the morris method would be suboptimal and the borgonovo index is not based on any assumptions on the dependence structure of the input variables x which makes it applicable in either case dependent or independent input variables borgonovo 2007 considering the complementary advantages of these three methods in gsa sobol index morris method and borgonovo index are conducted based on the daily sewer inspection database then the sensitivity index si is computed to screen out the significant sensitive parameters from the input parameters 2 5 1 morris method the morris method morris 1991 is an efficient screening sensitivity measure that allows for ranking input parameters and seeks to exhaustively cover the input space instead of looking at a single global perturbation it provides a grid where multiple different perturbations are achievable the sensitivity measure is then produced based on the mean and standard deviation of that set of perturbations taking a collection of independent input parameters x x 1 x k the set is then transformed to be uniformly distributed in the interval 0 1 a certain number r of sampling trajectories of k 1 points are generated to vary one input at a time across j levels of the 0 1 input domain starting from a given value of x and taking δ 1 j 1 1 1 j 1 the elementary effect of x i is given by eq 6 6 d i x y x 1 x 2 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k y x δ by sampling multiple initial values of x the distribution of this elementary effect can then be obtained the required sample size of morris model evaluations can be reduced to m 1 r for using a trajectory based sampling strategy where m represents the number of input parameters and r is the number of independent random paths a rough rule of thumb for sample size is that at least 10 n sample points are required to identify key factors where n is the number of experimental parameters levy and steinberg 2010 herein there are nine input parameters to obtain reliable sensitivity analysis sa results the number of independent random paths is taken as 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 and 1000 in sequence hence different training sample sizes are taken as 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 and 10 000 which are more than ten times the required minimum sample size of 90 10 9 2 5 2 sobol method the sobol method sobol 1993 decomposes the variance in the simulation results and estimates the relative influence of each parameter and the interaction between the parameters on the variance of the result additionally it can measure the sensitivity across the whole input space huang et al 2021 according to the sobol method the first order and total sobol sensitivity indices can then be defined concerning the total variance for the output result y jiang et al 2021 7 s j v a r j v a r y 8 s t j 1 v a r j v a r y where v a r j represents the variance of input parameters x j v a r j denotes the variance of all input parameters except x j v a r y represents the variance of the output y the first order index sj represents the fraction by which the output variance would be reduced on average by fixing xj within its range and the total effect stj includes the contribution of the first order effect and the sum of all higher order interaction effects jaxa rozen and kwakkel 2018 in practice monte carlo mc is typically applied to estimate sobol indices azzini et al 2021 in the mc based method the size of each of the samples is generated as r m 2 for a problem of dimension m therefore r is taken as 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 and 1000 in sequence which means that different training sample sizes are taken as 1100 1650 2200 2750 3300 3850 4400 4950 5500 and 11 000 2 5 3 borgonovo index method the borgonovo index δi borgonovo 2007 of a random input variable xi is a measure of the expected shift in the probability distribution of the model output when xi is set to a fixed value if the variable is not important the expected shift is close to zero otherwise it takes a larger value its derivation is not based on any assumptions on the dependence structure of the input variables x which makes it applicable in either case dependent or independent input variables the definition of the borgonovo index is shown in eq 9 where fy is the probability distribution function of the model output and f y x i is the conditional distribution on xi 9 δ i 1 2 e x i d y f y y f y x i y d y it is recommended that the sample size be greater than 1000 for the borgonovo method to achieve converging results marelli et al 2021 hence different training sample sizes are taken as 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 and 10 000 in the borgonovo index method 3 result 3 1 level i glmm at the catchment level 3 1 1 data exploration this section presents the final model selection procedure and two parameters are dropped table 3 gives an overview of model selection process and presents the dropping order of the explanatory parameters pearson correlation analysis is first performed to verify collinearity among five parameters and household density as one of the parameters is dropped since it is highly correlated with population density r 0 76 four parameters population density hcsd nighttime light tree density are then introduced into glmm after glmm completed its first run a group of indexes value vif p value aic are returned since p value of population density does not pass the significance level test this parameter is then removed from glmm although its removal would come at a small increase in aic again the vif p value and aic are calculated one more time to ensure the indexes value fall into valid range at the end the final model with parameters hcsd nighttime light and tree density is preferred as the optimal model as indicated in table 4 notably the vif p value and aic would be calculated again each time a parameter is removed during data preprocessing the vif values of the three variables in the glmm ranged from 1 11 to 1 53 and none of them exceeded 5 which means that the multicollinearity problem does not affect the regression coefficients of the model in addition the p value does not fluctuate much during the procedure 3 1 2 model performance and analysis glmm is conducted in the r package lme4 the following is the final model for estimating the lcsoo in the sewer system 10 η ln μ 1 μ 2 100 1 126 hotel and catering services density 0 747 nighttime light 0 667 tree density γ i γ i n 0 0 020 where γi is the random intercept for inspection area i table 5 presents the estimated regression coefficients for the final glmm the greater the distribution density of hcsd is the higher the lcsoo at the same time considering the impact of tree roots on the pipeline the distribution density of trees is also positively related to lcsoo an interesting phenomenon is that the parameter nighttime light intensity has a negative correlation with the response parameter which implies counterintuitively that the greater the nighttime light intensity is the lower the lcsoo this observation was also confirmed by mattsson et al 2014 and nieuwenhuis et al 2018 as described in the preceding model selection process two parameters household density and population density are dropped ultimately three significant p 0 05 indicators shown in table 5 are used in the glmm to predict the lcsoo in the sewer system the spatial distribution of the three normalized parameters is shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the southern bank of the yangzi river which covers the five inspection areas has a much lower lcsoo however partial regions of five inspection areas of 4 7 8 10 and 11 have a relatively higher overall lcsoo as shown in fig 3 d in which case the presence of an area specific design philosophy is articulated properly the use of random effects reduces the impact of unknown area specific characteristics allowing for accurate conclusions based on the existing data 3 2 level ii pc kriging model at the segment level 3 2 1 data exploration nine indicators are included in the deposit prediction at the segment level and the detailed description and range of each indicator are shown in table 6 variables pm and pipe category are identified as nominal data type yin et al 2020 and there are four types of material contained in pm concrete pvc clay others respectively and three types of pipe category namely main pipe branch pipe others given the small amount of category number of pm and pipe category one hot encoding method is carried out to generate dummy variable by using pandas package of python freeware in addition as shown in fig 4 the functional relationships between the output indicator and input indicators are obviously nonlinear generally the observed deposits exhibited negative relationships with input indicators with the exception of liquid level and lcsoo in certain situations the curves are quite steep some studies have also been conducted on the functional relationship between deposit content and pipe physical properties and their conclusions are also in line with the observations of this research ugarelli et al 2009 tran et al 2010 urban catchments with longer pipe lengths smaller diameters and shallow depths have relatively higher frequent blockage occurrences according to ugarelli et al 2009 it is also concluded that older pipelines are in better hydraulic condition by using an ordered probit deterioration model opdm and a probabilistic neural network deterioration model pnndm according to tran et al 2010 however there are contradicting opinions on the functional relationship between some influencing factors and deposit content the discrepancies may be created by the fact that all of the results are generated from statistical investigation of historical data which could also produce bias while other parameters are considered or a dataset of a different size is employed 3 2 2 meta model performance and analysis 1 deposit prediction performance against different indicator combinations to find the optimal combination of input indicators the possibilities for all combinations are traversed adding one indicator to the model at a time until all indicators are included meanwhile the percentages between the training and validation sets are increased from 0 6 to 0 9 by 0 05 units to create the optimal model r 2 is used to evaluate the performance of each simulation herein the sample set is randomly assigned three times against a certain training percentage and the value of r 2 is the average of three random calculations as seen from fig 5 the value of r 2 increases accordingly as the number of input indicators increases specifically when all nine indicators are included r 2 reaches a maximum of 0 922 which means that the number of input indicators is positively correlated with the predictive performance of the model at the same time as the number of input indicators increases the r 2 value growth slows down and finally shows convergence at approximately seven input indicators conversely the r 2 values increased significantly for the initial combination of one to four indicators additionally fig 5 also shows the comparison of r 2 with respect to seven different training groups from 60 training 40 validating to 90 training 10 validating from which it is concluded that r 2 would not improve dramatically in the case of an 80 training percentage 2 comparison between pc kriging and basic models adaboost and descision trees are used for comparison to demonstrate the performance of pc kriging with nine indicators in order to reduce the contingency caused by a random division we use k fold cross validation to train three models to improve the generalization ability in fig 6 a pc kriging enables to capture the computational model s global behavior and local variations whilst maintaining high prediction accuracy while adaboost and descision trees will overestimate or underestimate the value indicating that the pc kriging method is an optimal meta model as shown in fig 6 b pc kriging achieved the best prediction results with r2 rmse mae and mape values of 0 91 1 59 1 24 and 6 04 and the worst performing model is decision trees with r2 0 75 in fig 6 c the prediction error of pc kriging in the range of 3 15 to 3 25 exceeds 95 obviously pc kriging has exhibited more excellent performance 3 3 gsa under different sample sizes 3 3 1 three different sa methods varying sample sizes may have an impact on the sa results of methods such as sobol and morris according to previous work gan et al 2014 hence to investigate a sufficient sample size and qualitatively analyze the efficiency of each sa method the three methods employed in this research should be compared with different sample sizes it is important to determine the range and distribution of each parameter in gsa research wang et al 2013 because it may affect related parameters such as the main sensitivity index msi and the total sensitivity index tsi bai et al 2019 table 6 summarizes the ranges and distributions of the input parameters the empirical frequency distribution and cumulative probability for each parameter are shown in fig 7 and lognormal and normal distributions are adopted to fit the parameters on the basis of the fitting accuracy we summarize the best fitting distribution mean or ln mean and standard deviation sd or ln sd of each parameter and the input sets for gsa can be generated based on the best fitting distribution 1 morris method to exactly determine the least size of training samples for effective screening different training sample sizes 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 and 10 000 are set for output the thickness of deposits the results of different combinations of training samples are shown in fig 8 where μ reflects the sensitivity of the inputs to the outputs the larger μ is the more sensitive the input is the σ value indicates the interaction between inputs which means that the larger σ is the stronger the input interaction in other words the sa results from the morris method shown in fig 8 are inconsistent and the ranks of μ and σ markedly vary with different sample sizes when the sample sizes increase from 1000 to 10 000 the input with the maximum μ to output is lcsoo the input with the maximum σ to output is pm when the sample size is between 1500 and 3500 for output the sa results which can be inferred by μ and σ become steady fig 8 illustrates that the sa results by the morris method are similar overall when the sample size reached a certain range the sa results were relatively stable so the sample size in this research was set as 1500 2 sobol method the sobol method of mc can also be estimated with different sample sizes in this step the sa results of different training sample sizes 1100 1650 2200 2750 3300 3850 4400 4950 5500 and 11 000 are set for the output parameter as shown in fig 9 overall when the sample size is larger than 5000 for output the rank of sensitive input parameters becomes stable by comparing the sa results from s1 and st the rank of sensitive input parameters exhibits some significant change which indicates that the interaction effect of the input has a certain influence on the output as training sample sizes increase lcsoo is always the parameter most sensitive to s1 for st lcsoo is the most sensitive parameter with a sample size 2500 however when the sample size 3000 pm is the most sensitive parameter fig 9 indicates that the sa results by the mc based method become stable after the sample sizes exceed a certain value which can be set as 5500 in this research 3 borgonovo index method fig 10 shows the borgonovo index s sa results of different sample sizes as the sample size increases the index results gradually become stationary except for the parameter lcsoo the sa results of other input parameters are relatively stable as the sample size increases and the rank of each input parameter does not change much so the sample size in the research is chosen to be 3500 3 3 2 sensitivity analysis result to ensure that the three gsa methods employed in this research can effectively classify the parameters as sensitive or insensitive this section explores the results of these three methods using the morris sobol and borgonovo methods combined with the previous sa results the sample size is selected as the same r 500 i e morris 5000 sobol 5500 borgonovo 5000 to ensure that the calculation results of each method can converge stably to compare the consistency of the three sa results all nine input parameters are shown based on respective sa measures for different methods in fig 11 herein to distinguish the proportion of the si of each input variable to the total si it is assumed that the total si of all input variables is 1 fig 11 shows that the variation trends of the parameter sensitivity of the three methods are relatively consistent overall the sa results of the three methods have a certain reference value for screening out sensitive parameters according to the sa results the top three significant inputs are lcsoo pa and pm for the thickness of deposits to provide a concise summary and quick overview of the models performances a taylor diagram is introduced as shown in fig 12 a according to the ranking of the result of sobol s1 the input indicators are introduced into the model from large to small namely m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m6 m7 m8 and m9 the detail inputs of each model have been shown in table 7 fig 12 a shows that m9 has the highest correlation coefficient and the lowest rmse which indicates that the model containing nine input indicators has the best prediction effect fig 12 b shows the scatterplot of the observation data and the prediction data by m9 the comparison datasets contain training datasets and validation datasets with a training percentage of 80 herein the r 2 values of the training datasets and validation datasets are calculated as 0 9194 and 0 9005 respectively the values of r 2 are all close to 1 which means that the pc kriging model can predict the thickness of deposits with high reliability the black dashed line in fig 12 b means that the observation data are equal to the prediction data and the orange line is the fit line of the training datasets while the gray line is the fit line of the validation datasets the small deviation between the above three lines indicates the good fitting accuracy of the pc kriging model 4 discussion this study sheds light on crucial factors of social environmental and demographic catchment characteristics connected to the lcsoo the first model is composed of three parameters hcsd nighttime light and tree density the high significance of input parameters 0 0090 0 0006 0 0001 shows that specific demographic groups share certain lifestyles environmental conditions and public facilities it is worth mentioning that the results may be expressed differently in the case of other study areas division methods in terms of indicators identified at level ii in this study the input indicators for the second model are pa pd pm bd slope ll fv category and lcsoo compared with traditional monitoring methods the input indicators such as liquid level flow rate material involved in this study are lower in monitoring cost and easier to measure and collect therefore determining a few key indicators to train a model without significantly affecting prediction accuracy is critical this can considerably increase the model s operational efficiency and minimize computational cost it is also worth noting that as a result of the gsa experiment lcsoo is retained for the final model construction in our case study since including lcsoo does contribute to increasing prediction accuracy however given the proposed framework can be generalized for developing prediction models for sewer systems in other cities or even other types of city infrastructure the situation may be different because the model is determined based on historical data for the specific sewer network as a result lcsoo may not be identified as an essential input variable and excluded from the final model therefore it is necessary that the catchment lcsoo serves as the original input for the segment level prediction model according to the experimental outcomes a prediction model with a single input output pattern is insufficient to accurately estimate the thickness of deposits additionally the procedure of increasing the input indicators one at a time and identifying the input combination with the optimal prediction accuracy requires a significant amount of effort and resources alternatively a multi indicator control strategy based on gsa may bring out a collection of input indicators which considerably account for the output uncertainty to construct an optimal prediction model lcsoo pa pm slope pd fv and ll serve as input indicators for deposit prediction as shown in fig 12 a and the prediction performance is similar to those of the nine indications used as input this suggests that the cost of data collection for the bd and category can be decreased the fewest indicators may be utilized to properly predict the thickness of deposits and provide a timely warning of excessive deposit content which is critical to treating or avoiding incidents such as urban sewer network blockage and csos 5 conclusion and further direction the authors proposed a data driven bilevel model to predict deposits in the sewer system and the main contributions are as follows 1 the contribution of the research not only lie in developing a data driven deposits prediction model instead of traditional detection method but more importantly enables a fresh perspective for multi scale i e large scale and individual scale analysis of sewer system that specifically in this case how to quantify and integrate observable and unobservable information from both level into the final prediction model furthermore the proposed method also has satisfactory generalizability that it provides a framework which can be generalized for municipal agencies in other cities to create their own prediction models for sewer systems or other city facilities 2 in this research glmm is first employed to explore the differences of sewer system general condition among catchments caused by specific demographic groups compared to the previous study that mainly focus on individual level analysis the results of catchment level model presented by gis shows the general state of sewer system among different areas which can help managers to identify the critical catchments that require more attention than others then at the segment level pc kriging method is applied to build a meta model to achieve quick predictions in comparison with other meta models pc kriging enables to capture the computational model s global behavior and local variations whilst maintaining high prediction accuracy which enhances the practicability of the meta model 3 additionally this study contributes to the body of knowledge by proposing a procedure that can cope with deposits accumulation uncertainty and support gsa based on given multi scale data source with high reliability and by identifying the crucial deposits contributing parameters in sewer system a feasible preventive strategy for the early warning of blockage has been proposed which could assist the sewerage maintenance departments in developing maintenance plans for dredging work in the sewer systems future research may focus on two aspects on the one hand to explore the chemical composition of sewage in the drainage network to improve the model prediction performance on the other hand to

15079,river water is an essential human resource that may be contaminated with hazardous microorganisms however the risk of yeast infection through river water exposure is unclear because it is highly dependant on individual susceptibility and has therefore not been well studied to date to evaluate this undefined risk we analysed the fungal communities in less polluted lp and highly polluted hp river water as determined using principal coordinate analysis of pollution indicators we enumerated culturable yeasts using a thermally selective isolation procedure 37 c and thus promoted the growth of potentially opportunistic species yeast species identified as clinically relevant were then tested for antifungal resistance in addition we propose a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra framework to quantitatively assess the potential risk of yeast infection our results indicated that pollution levels significantly altered fungal communities p 0 007 and that genera representing opportunistic and pathogenic members were significantly more abundant in hp waters p 0 038 additionally the yeast species candida glabrata and clavispora lusitaniae positively correlated with other pollution indicators demonstrating the species indicator potential our qmra results further indicate that higher risk of infection is associated with increased water pollution levels considering both physicochemical and bacterial indicators furthermore yeast species with higher pathogenic potential present an increased risk of infection despite lower observed concentrations in the river water interestingly the bloom of meyerozyma guilliermondii during the wet season suggests that other environmental factors such as dissolved oxygen levels and water turbulence might affect growth characteristics of yeasts in river water which consequently affects the distribution of annual infection risks the presence of antifungal resistant yeasts observed in this study could further contribute to variation in risk distribution research on the ecophysiology of yeasts in these environments is therefore necessary to ameliorate the uncertainty and sensitivity of the proposed qmra model in addition to the vital knowledge on opportunistic and pathogenic yeast occurrence in river water and their observed association with pollution this study provides valuable methods and insights to initiate future qmras of yeast infections graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords qmra thermally selective isolation pathogenic potential antifungal resistance yeasts river water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river water is often polluted with agricultural industrial and anthropogenic waste which indisputably poses a threat to human health schwarzenbach et al 2010 micropollutants like endocrine disrupting compounds edcs tan et al 2022 and infectious microorganisms including viruses and pathogenic bacteria schwarzenbach et al 2010 yang et al 2022 are major contributors to this threat while the risk of infection by viruses parasites and bacteria have been evaluated and quantitatively assessed our understanding of the health threat that unicellular fungi yeasts pose is largely based on reports of hospital related cases suleyman and alangaden 2016 as a result the risk of fungal infections via water exposure remains poorly described despite the lurking presence of these microbes in aquatic environments weiskerger and brandão 2020 candida spp along with other opportunistic yeasts have been detected in rivers across the globe steffen et al 2022 cogliati et al 2022 however the cause of occurrence and ecology of clinically relevant yeasts in river water remain poorly understood nonetheless the detection of clinically relevant yeasts including candida albicans in river water raised concerns about the impact on human health particularly for immunocompromised individuals residing in rural settlements who might rely on nearby rivers for daily water use edokpayi et al 2018 ellis et al 2000 direct exposure to polluted waters could therefore place these persons at risk of contracting yeast infections a situation that could be detrimental for those who lack access to treatment and further exacerbated by the global emergence of antifungal resistance kneale et al 2016 perlin et al 2017 quantitative assessments of the risk of obtaining infection from direct river water exposure have not yet been established for fungal pathogens since the necessary statistical parameters have not yet been developed weiskerger and brandão 2020 these parameters are probabilistic values used to estimate infection risks and are derived from virulence studies investigating the relationship between pathogen inoculum sizes dose and host symptoms response haas 2015 until recently similar studies investigating virulence of yeast pathogens however were insufficient for dose response modelling casadevall s 2017 equation which determines the pathogenic potential pp of a microbe using available clinical data could potentially serve as a proxy for some dose response model parameters additionally smith and casadevall 2022 published a follow up paper comparing the pp of a few fungi further paving the way for some contextual calculations in quantitative microbial risk assessments qmras providing a baseline of risk estimations using alternative measures might not immediately be applicable for risk management or policy making but it can serve as a valuable building block to establish qmra frameworks for fungal infections the aim of this study was therefore to estimate the risk of clinically relevant yeasts present in polluted water from a south african river system situated near urban and industrial areas by investigating the fungal diversity of the river water subjected to different levels of pollution and isolating potentially pathogenic yeasts using thermally selective isolation we demonstrate the fungal hazards present in the river water additionally we emphasize the potential treatment complications associated with clinically relevant yeasts by determining their antifungal susceptibility profiles ultimately our provisional qmra of yeast infections following river water ingestion provides initial insight into the mycoses related risk posed by direct exposure to contaminated river water and currently serves as the foundation on which future qmra frameworks of yeast infections may be built 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area river water sampling was conducted in and around stellenbosch western cape south africa ten sampling sites were selected along a section of the eersterivier river catchment tributaries such as plankenbrug river krom river and the veldwagters river

sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units with a 97 similarity and classified using a cut off value of 80 all samples were normalized to contain the same number of sequences 2 4 isolation and enumeration of yeasts up to 100 ml water from each sample was filtered polycarbonate filter holder sartorius stedim biotech göttingen germany through a nitrocellulose membrane 0 45 µm sartorius stedim biotech that was subsequently placed onto sabouraud dextrose agar sda atlas 2010 supplemented with 500 mg l chloramphenicol sigma aldrich agar plates were incubated at 37 c for 20 24

evaluated using gel electrophoresis prior to being submitted for sanger sequencing at the central analytical facilities stellenbosch university south africa sequences were analysed using finchtv finch tv 1 4 0 geospiza inc prior to blast identification on the ncbi database http www ncbi nlm nih gov briefly the 28s ribosomal rna sequences lsu from the fungi type and reference material database on ncbi targeted loci project was used to analyse the amplified sequences of the isolates and sequence alignment hits with the highest maximum score and an e value of zero were recognised as positive

tested against the clinically relevant yeasts identified during the study the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of yeast strains was determined using the broth microdilution method as stipulated by the clinical and laboratory standards institute m27 a2 nccls 2002 2 8 statistical analyses 2 8 1 water quality and thermotolerant yeasts all data collected from sampling events were statistically analysed using xlstat version 2021 4 addinsoft inc paris france to determine means standard errors and correlations between parameters due to the non normality of the data as determined by a shapiro wilk test the kruskal wallis and multiple pairwise comparisons steel dwass critchlaw flinger method tests were used to evaluate significant differences between sampling sites significance was determined at a confidence level of 95 p 0 05 furthermore multivariate correlations were investigated between microbiological and physicochemical data through redundancy analysis rda a permutation test was included to confirm whether response and explanatory variables were linearly related 2 8 2 fungal community analysis all statistical analyses were performed in mothur v 1 44 1 and r v 4 1 0 r

the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix further statistical evaluations of the pcoa plots were conducted using permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova spearman correlation tests were performed between environmental measures and pcoa ordinations based on the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix differences in pathogenic abundance between pollution groups was assessed using the mann whitney test graphpad software inc san diego ca usa for all statistical evaluations a p value of 0 05 was considered significant 2 9 provisional qmra of yeast infections various parameters are used when conducting qmra namely contaminant concentrations context specific exposure route parameters microorganism survival probability and concentration at which 50 of a population are infected haas 2015 the latter two parameters are dose response estimates and are determined using clinical data obtained from species specific virulence studies in animal hosts studies focusing on these characteristics of pathogenic yeasts are either lacking or insubstantial nevertheless the pathogenicity of candida albicans candida tropicalis candida glabrata clavispora lusitaniae syn candida lusitaniae meyerozyma guilliermondii syn candida guilliermondii and pichia kudriavzevii syn candida krusei has been investigated arendrup et al 2002 fromtling et al 1987 hasenclever 1959 wingard et al 1982 thus we used the data from these studies to calculate the pp of the yeast species as described by casadevall 2017 to be used as a proxy for the k parameter in exponential dose response based qmra frameworks we employed the risk software by palisade version 8 raleigh nc usa and used the pp of the yeasts to determine the risk of yeast infection after exposure to the river water 2 9 1 exposure assessment clinical studies quantifying the infectivity of yeast species via common exposure routes such as skin contact and aerosol inhalation are not available in literature we therefore identified direct ingestion followed by gut translocation of the yeast as the exposure route for infection by pathogenic yeasts occurring in river water species specific exposure doses eq 1 were calculated for accidental 1 ml day and intentional 100 ml day ingestion abia et al 2016 using the following equation 1 d e x p o s u r e v i n g e s t i o n c c o n t a m i n a n t the total daily ingestion of the water source is represented by the volume ingested v i n g e s t i o n while the species specific yeast concentration is represented by the contaminant concentration c c o n t a m i n a n t the latter was calculated by determining total thermotolerant yeast counts on the filter disks that were incubated on the sda plates then by identification of random isolates from the disks tables s3 9 yeast cell concentrations were subsequently calculated with the assumption that one yeast colony would represent approximately 1 106 cells joseph and hall 2004 and log transformed to normalize the data table s10 yeast concentration results obtained from hp and lp sites were pooled respectively 2 9 2 dose response parameter proxies since no clinical dose response models currently exist for pathogenic yeasts the above mentioned pp was used as a proxy to determine the probability of infection the pp was calculated according to the method of casadevall 2017 using eq 2 2 p p f s i 10 m where f s fraction of affected individuals that show symptoms of infection i infecting inoculum cells m fraction of death outcomes amongst infected individuals using this equation we determined the pps of alternative pathogenic microbes bacteria protozoa and viruses to compare with the dose response model parameter k estimate used in exponential qmra frameworks of the corresponding pathogens and consequently found that they were comparable table s11 we then determined the pp of seven clinically relevant yeasts table 2 in preparation for provisional qmra for six of these seven yeast species to determine the daily risk of yeast infection p i n f e c t i o n d weiskerger and brandão 2020 a modification of the exponential dose response model eq 3 was used in this study whereby k was replaced by pp eq 4 3 p i n f e c t i o n 1 e k d e x p o s u r e 4 p i n f e c t i o n d 1 e p p d e x p o s u r e the annual risk of infection p i n f e c t i o n a was subsequently determined using the following equation 5 p i n f e c t i o n a 1 1 p i n f e c t i o n d 365 the following assumptions were made while conducting the qmra during this study a individuals accidentally and or intentionally ingesting natural surface water do so on a daily basis b wild type and clinical yeast strains would react similarly upon exposure to the host individuals c isolation at 37 c mimics the immediate stress a yeast is exposed to inside the host d translocation of the yeast from the intestines into the bloodstream occurs post ingestion in order to cause infection hirayama et al 2020 zhai et al 2020 and e the murine model used in yeast virulence studies adequately mimics human host conditions for the purpose of this study risk of infection was determined for river water of significantly different quality hp and lp 3 results 3 1 water quality analysis the mean values of the physicochemical parameters investigated for water quality analysis of lp and hp sites are presented in table 3 no significant difference in ph was observed between the two groups river water temperature was significantly higher at hp sites p 0 002 additionally significantly higher conductivity p 0 0001 cod p 0 0001 and ammonia concentrations p 0 0003 were observed at hp sites compared with lp sites the do concentrations of the river water were significantly lower at hp sites than that of lp sites p 0 0001 the mean values of e coli and coliform concentrations for lp and hp sites are depicted in fig 2 concentrations of both e coli and coliforms were significantly higher at hp sites than at lp sites p 0 0001 3 2 fungal diversity the relationships of fungal community composition represented by relative abundance as determined using pacbio sequencing data between different sites is presented in fig 3 the fungal communities of less polluted lp and highly polluted hp sites differed significantly p 0 007 fungal community analyses indicated that the most predominant phylum detected at all sites was ascomycota three other major phyla were also detected namely rozellomycota previously cryptomycota basidiomycota and chytridiomycota twenty genera from these phyla that may harbour opportunistic and pathogenic fungal strains were detected at an overall relative abundance of 0 91 fig 4 a significantly higher relative abundance of pathogen representing genera was observed at hp sites compared to lp sites p 0 038 3 3 occurrence of thermotolerant yeasts in river water the mean yeast concentrations cfu 100 ml for lp and hp sites are depicted in fig 2 the experimental period encompassed all seasons table 1 mean yeast concentrations did not differ significantly between the two groups fig 2 however significantly lower yeast concentrations were observed during september 2020 february 2021 and april 2021 compared to the observed yeast concentrations of the remaining sampling months table 1 fig s7 aside from a weak negative correlation to cod r 0 103 overall thermotolerant yeast concentrations did not correlate with any of the other measured physicochemical parameters in this study 3 4 yeast identification thermotolerant representatives of 42 different yeast species were isolated from the river

2020 treguier et al 2018 3 5 multivariate correlation analysis redundancy analysis rda was carried out on microbiological and physicochemical data collected during this study the microbiological data included e coli and total coliform counts total thermotolerant yeast concentrations as well as the concentrations of the most frequently 10 isolated yeast species the analysis involved multiple linear regression and principal component analysis to construct an ordination biplot demonstrating the associations between the different parameters fig 5 the biplot collectively represents 87 14 of the variation in the data based on the distance from the origin on the rda biplot in fig 5 the variation was highest for microbiological data in fig 5 s cerevisiae concentrations appear to have a strong positive association with ph however pearson correlation analysis revealed a weak correlation ph r 0 086 the pollution indicators nh3 cod and conductivity positively correlated and clustered on the

and cod total thermotolerant yeasts nh3 r 0 082 cod r 0 103 and m guilliermondii nh3 r 0 084 cod r 0 109 furthermore a positive association was observed between thermotolerant yeast concentration and do values for sites s9 and s8 figs s8 10 3 6 antifungal susceptibility yeast isolates recovered from the different sampling sites and identified as representatives of clinically relevant species designated p or op in table 4 were subjected to antifungal susceptibility testing consequently the flu and amb mics were determined for these yeasts two yeast isolates representing candida blankii and pichia kluyveri had mics of 16 mg l and 32 mg l respectively furthermore most isolates identified as p kudriavzevii had flu mics of 16 mg l and 32 mg l potential flu resistance was observed for one c

susceptible to amb the highest amb mic 4 mg l was observed for a c glabrata isolate two isolates of p kudriavzevii and one c tropicalis isolate 3 7 qmra the risk of obtaining a yeast infection via river water ingestion was estimated for six clinically relevant species c albicans c glabrata c tropicalis c lusitaniae m guilliermondii and p kudriavzevii the annual probabilities of infection via ingestion for four of the six yeast species in lp waters and all six species in hp waters are presented in table 5 the risk values for c albicans and c tropicalis detected in hp sites only were considerably higher than those of c glabrata c lusitaniae m guilliermondii and p kudriavzevii despite lower observed concentration in the river water amongst the four species detected at both lp and hp sites c glabrata had the highest risk values on the other hand the lowest risk values were observed for m guilliermondii and p kudriavzevii in all cases excluding m guilliermondii risk of infection increased by at least 20 at hp sites compared with risk of infection at lp sites 4 discussion exposure to polluted waters has negative effects on human health especially due to harmful microorganisms proliferating in the nutrient rich conditions schwarzenbach et al 2010 various disease causing bacteria have been identified in the plankenbrug and surrounding rivers investigated in our study highlighting the existing health risks associated with these waters ackermann 2010 barnes and taylor 2004 the presence of clinically relevant yeasts in these rivers however was only considered by a few postma 2016 stone et al 2012 using culture based methods and high throughput sequencing our study revealed the presence of various yeast species tables 4 s14 as well as genera fig 4 that represent opportunistic and pathogenic members in polluted river water fungi have been detected in polluted rivers as early as the 1970 s where ascomycetous yeasts such as candida spp predominated waters contaminated with domestic pollutants woollett and hedrick 1970 this is in accordance with our recurrent detection of candida spp in river water characterised by high levels of faecal contamination indicated by the presence of e coli and coliforms additionally other studies have shown that yeast members of ascomycota and basidiomycota dominated river microbiomes during which candida spp were amongst the frequently detected opportunistic and pathogenic members in anthropogenically influenced waters brandão et al 2021 coelho et al 2010 monapathi et al 2020 pietryczuk et al 2018 our results corroborate these findings and have linked the opportunistic yeast species c lusitaniae and c glabrata with pollution indicators moreover the genus clavispora was not detected in lp sites during fungal community analysis further supporting the indicator potential of c lusitaniae fig 4 while not investigated here emerging contaminants such as edcs may also be amongst the pollutants that are associated with clinically relevant yeasts as some yeasts harbour receptors for these compounds jarque et al 2016 iuele et al 2022 it is therefore essential that this potential correlation be explored amongst specific species such as c lusitaniae and c glabrata due to their association with pollution observed in our study total thermotolerant yeast species on the other hand should not be considered since no significant difference was observed between total thermotolerant yeast concentrations of lp and hp sites fig 2 although significant differences in site specific yeast concentrations were observed in the dry months of summer these concentrations were significantly increased at all sites irrespective of pollution level during rainy months fig s7 the increased yeast concentrations correlated strongly with the presence of m guilliermondii r 0 999 an ascomycetous opportunistic yeast that dominated the culturable yeast populations following thermally selective isolation figs s11 13 to elucidate this observation additional experimentation was conducted which indicated that m guilliermondii was a slow grower under static medium conditions µmax 0 0046 od595 h while the controls p kudriavzevii strains showed a µmax 0 0132 od595 h however when the medium was agitated the maximum growth rate of m guilliermondii increased to 0 0793 od595 h which was comparable to that of the p kudriavzevii strains µmax 0 0884 od595 h when incubated under similar conditions fig s14 increased turbulence and oxygen concentrations in the river robustly resembling the conditions in agitated media could therefore have provided a competitive advantage to m guilliermondii resulting in a bloom of this species in the river water during and after rainfall moreover the versatile metabolism of this yeast might grant competitive advantages under limited but diverse nutrient conditions mo et al 2021 yan et al 2021 interestingly other studies have noted contrasting results concerning the influence of water turbulence and oxygen levels on yeast concentrations ortiz vera et al 2018 woollett and hedrick 1970 however our study selectively enumerated thermotolerant yeasts and excluded the mesophiles as such the comparably low relative abundance of the genus meyerozyma detected during fungal community analysis no selective pressure applied contradicted the corresponding high m guilliermondii concentrations observed following thermally selective isolation fig 4 while our isolation method does not consider other host conditions that may influence the viable populations of yeasts thermal restriction serves as an appropriate selective measure to enumerate the potentially opportunistic yeast species that are capable of surviving within an endothermic host such as humans amongst the other thermally tolerant yeasts isolated in this study were renowned yeast species such as c albicans c tropicalis c glabrata p kudriavzevii and l elongisporus these yeasts are causative agents of invasive infections that can potentially be fatal cooper 2011 additionally we detected clinically relevant yeasts that have not been reported to be present in river water prior to this study candida melibiosica candida pseudoaaseri c mucoides cyberlindnera jadinii kodamaea ohmeri p kluyveri and wickerhamomyces onychis their reason for occurrence in the river water remains undefined however considering the increase in emergence of opportunistic yeasts in clinical facilities miceli et al 2011 it is possible these yeasts were introduced to the river water via domestic waste it is noteworthy that we did not detect candida auris a multi drug resistant and clinically emergent yeast however its recent isolation from marine environments suggest that this yeast might be more adapted to saline conditions and is outcompeted in fresh waters arora et al 2021 magobo et al 2014 the presence of fluconazole resistant yeast species in the river water might also be derived from human waste entering the river or is a result of acquired resistance towards pharmaceutical contaminants present in the water assress et al 2020 fisher et al 2022 the occurrence and exposure to these antifungal resistant yeasts nonetheless increase morbidity risks and challenge favourable clinical outcomes in patients perlin et al 2017 moreover the presence of these yeasts could potentially increase the annual risk of infection mitigating disease risks often requires quantitative intervention by conducting qmras smeets et al 2010 previously qmras on river water have demonstrated the risk of infection by bacteria viruses and parasites federigi et al 2019 albeit mostly for recreational use recently the world health organisation who released a report on prioritising fungal pathogens in future research who 2022 we report here for the first time the risk of infection by six clinically relevant yeast species four of which were prioritised by the who through accidental intentional ingestion of river water our results indicate that risk of infection positively associates with pollution levels excluding the findings for m guilliermondii which presented a uniform distribution of concentration however it should be noted that the microbial blooms of m guilliermondii suggest that environmental conditions might affect the risk distribution of infections by yeasts this underscores the importance of developing probability distributions for contaminant concentrations in qmra rather than using single average or median values it also suggests that the eco physiology of yeasts may play a significant role in future qmras uncertainty and sensitivity analyses limitations of the provisional qmra framework presented here include the lack of correction factors for infectivity due to limited clinical data and non dynamic modelling that only produces a snapshot of the risks associated with ingestion of river water additional studies surveying community health conditions and usage of river water would be necessary for more dynamic qmra modelling of yeast infections a previous study detailing the use and quality of water in rural communities for example indicated that different sources of water were used at varying frequencies across seasons due to rainfall reduced water access and inconsistencies in municipal water supply edokpayi et al 2018 conducting similar studies on river water usage could greatly contribute to future qmras of yeast infections to realistically express the presumed seasonally variable health threat faced by immunocompromised individuals 5 conclusion the health threats posed by viral parasitological and bacterial microorganisms in polluted river water have been evaluated however the risks pertaining to fungal pathogens remain unclear our understanding of exposure to these microorganisms is largely based on reports of their occurrence in clinical and natural settings and lack a substantial link to public health and infection risk severity this could hamper future exposure management diagnosis and treatment strategies which negatively affects the immunocompromised population countries such as south africa which have a disproportionally large population of immunocompromised people due to the hiv are particularly vulnerable to these risks our findings indicate the presence of known opportunistic yeast species that could potentially increase fungal infection cases for individuals that rely on natural water sources moreover the provisional risk assessment results suggest that infection risks increase with pollution levels and certain yeast species such as c albicans might cause greater harm than others irrespective of lower observed concentrations our study clearly highlights the need for river water remediation and mycosis risk management however it also emphasises the need for additional research to enhance the provisional qmra of yeast infections to address population and environmental characteristics that might alter risk estimations overall we highlight the underrated threat posed by opportunistic and pathogenic yeast species through water exposure and underscore the necessary research gaps that would refine our understanding of this threat to public health credit authorship contribution statement heidi christa steffen investigation formal analysis writing original draft

15079,river water is an essential human resource that may be contaminated with hazardous microorganisms however the risk of yeast infection through river water exposure is unclear because it is highly dependant on individual susceptibility and has therefore not been well studied to date to evaluate this undefined risk we analysed the fungal communities in less polluted lp and highly polluted hp river water as determined using principal coordinate analysis of pollution indicators we enumerated culturable yeasts using a thermally selective isolation procedure 37 c and thus promoted the growth of potentially opportunistic species yeast species identified as clinically relevant were then tested for antifungal resistance in addition we propose a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra framework to quantitatively assess the potential risk of yeast infection our results indicated that pollution levels significantly altered fungal communities p 0 007 and that genera representing opportunistic and pathogenic members were significantly more abundant in hp waters p 0 038 additionally the yeast species candida glabrata and clavispora lusitaniae positively correlated with other pollution indicators demonstrating the species indicator potential our qmra results further indicate that higher risk of infection is associated with increased water pollution levels considering both physicochemical and bacterial indicators furthermore yeast species with higher pathogenic potential present an increased risk of infection despite lower observed concentrations in the river water interestingly the bloom of meyerozyma guilliermondii during the wet season suggests that other environmental factors such as dissolved oxygen levels and water turbulence might affect growth characteristics of yeasts in river water which consequently affects the distribution of annual infection risks the presence of antifungal resistant yeasts observed in this study could further contribute to variation in risk distribution research on the ecophysiology of yeasts in these environments is therefore necessary to ameliorate the uncertainty and sensitivity of the proposed qmra model in addition to the vital knowledge on opportunistic and pathogenic yeast occurrence in river water and their observed association with pollution this study provides valuable methods and insights to initiate future qmras of yeast infections graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords qmra thermally selective isolation pathogenic potential antifungal resistance yeasts river water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river water is often polluted with agricultural industrial and anthropogenic waste which indisputably poses a threat to human health schwarzenbach et al 2010 micropollutants like endocrine disrupting compounds edcs tan et al 2022 and infectious microorganisms including viruses and pathogenic bacteria schwarzenbach et al 2010 yang et al 2022 are major contributors to this threat while the risk of infection by viruses parasites and bacteria have been evaluated and quantitatively assessed our understanding of the health threat that unicellular fungi yeasts pose is largely based on reports of hospital related cases suleyman and alangaden 2016 as a result the risk of fungal infections via water exposure remains poorly described despite the lurking presence of these microbes in aquatic environments weiskerger and brandão 2020 candida spp along with other opportunistic yeasts have been detected in rivers across the globe steffen et al 2022 cogliati et al 2022 however the cause of occurrence and ecology of clinically relevant yeasts in river water remain poorly understood nonetheless the detection of clinically relevant yeasts including candida albicans in river water raised concerns about the impact on human health particularly for immunocompromised individuals residing in rural settlements who might rely on nearby rivers for daily water use edokpayi et al 2018 ellis et al 2000 direct exposure to polluted waters could therefore place these persons at risk of contracting yeast infections a situation that could be detrimental for those who lack access to treatment and further exacerbated by the global emergence of antifungal resistance kneale et al 2016 perlin et al 2017 quantitative assessments of the risk of obtaining infection from direct river water exposure have not yet been established for fungal pathogens since the necessary statistical parameters have not yet been developed weiskerger and brandão 2020 these parameters are probabilistic values used to estimate infection risks and are derived from virulence studies investigating the relationship between pathogen inoculum sizes dose and host symptoms response haas 2015 until recently similar studies investigating virulence of yeast pathogens however were insufficient for dose response modelling casadevall s 2017 equation which determines the pathogenic potential pp of a microbe using available clinical data could potentially serve as a proxy for some dose response model parameters additionally smith and casadevall 2022 published a follow up paper comparing the pp of a few fungi further paving the way for some contextual calculations in quantitative microbial risk assessments qmras providing a baseline of risk estimations using alternative measures might not immediately be applicable for risk management or policy making but it can serve as a valuable building block to establish qmra frameworks for fungal infections the aim of this study was therefore to estimate the risk of clinically relevant yeasts present in polluted water from a south african river system situated near urban and industrial areas by investigating the fungal diversity of the river water subjected to different levels of pollution and isolating potentially pathogenic yeasts using thermally selective isolation we demonstrate the fungal hazards present in the river water additionally we emphasize the potential treatment complications associated with clinically relevant yeasts by determining their antifungal susceptibility profiles ultimately our provisional qmra of yeast infections following river water ingestion provides initial insight into the mycoses related risk posed by direct exposure to contaminated river water and currently serves as the foundation on which future qmra frameworks of yeast infections may be built 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area river water sampling was conducted in and around stellenbosch western cape south africa ten sampling sites were selected along a section of the eersterivier river catchment tributaries such as plankenbrug river krom river and the veldwagters river

sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units with a 97 similarity and classified using a cut off value of 80 all samples were normalized to contain the same number of sequences 2 4 isolation and enumeration of yeasts up to 100 ml water from each sample was filtered polycarbonate filter holder sartorius stedim biotech göttingen germany through a nitrocellulose membrane 0 45 µm sartorius stedim biotech that was subsequently placed onto sabouraud dextrose agar sda atlas 2010 supplemented with 500 mg l chloramphenicol sigma aldrich agar plates were incubated at 37 c for 20 24

evaluated using gel electrophoresis prior to being submitted for sanger sequencing at the central analytical facilities stellenbosch university south africa sequences were analysed using finchtv finch tv 1 4 0 geospiza inc prior to blast identification on the ncbi database http www ncbi nlm nih gov briefly the 28s ribosomal rna sequences lsu from the fungi type and reference material database on ncbi targeted loci project was used to analyse the amplified sequences of the isolates and sequence alignment hits with the highest maximum score and an e value of zero were recognised as positive

tested against the clinically relevant yeasts identified during the study the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of yeast strains was determined using the broth microdilution method as stipulated by the clinical and laboratory standards institute m27 a2 nccls 2002 2 8 statistical analyses 2 8 1 water quality and thermotolerant yeasts all data collected from sampling events were statistically analysed using xlstat version 2021 4 addinsoft inc paris france to determine means standard errors and correlations between parameters due to the non normality of the data as determined by a shapiro wilk test the kruskal wallis and multiple pairwise comparisons steel dwass critchlaw flinger method tests were used to evaluate significant differences between sampling sites significance was determined at a confidence level of 95 p 0 05 furthermore multivariate correlations were investigated between microbiological and physicochemical data through redundancy analysis rda a permutation test was included to confirm whether response and explanatory variables were linearly related 2 8 2 fungal community analysis all statistical analyses were performed in mothur v 1 44 1 and r v 4 1 0 r

the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix further statistical evaluations of the pcoa plots were conducted using permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova spearman correlation tests were performed between environmental measures and pcoa ordinations based on the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix differences in pathogenic abundance between pollution groups was assessed using the mann whitney test graphpad software inc san diego ca usa for all statistical evaluations a p value of 0 05 was considered significant 2 9 provisional qmra of yeast infections various parameters are used when conducting qmra namely contaminant concentrations context specific exposure route parameters microorganism survival probability and concentration at which 50 of a population are infected haas 2015 the latter two parameters are dose response estimates and are determined using clinical data obtained from species specific virulence studies in animal hosts studies focusing on these characteristics of pathogenic yeasts are either lacking or insubstantial nevertheless the pathogenicity of candida albicans candida tropicalis candida glabrata clavispora lusitaniae syn candida lusitaniae meyerozyma guilliermondii syn candida guilliermondii and pichia kudriavzevii syn candida krusei has been investigated arendrup et al 2002 fromtling et al 1987 hasenclever 1959 wingard et al 1982 thus we used the data from these studies to calculate the pp of the yeast species as described by casadevall 2017 to be used as a proxy for the k parameter in exponential dose response based qmra frameworks we employed the risk software by palisade version 8 raleigh nc usa and used the pp of the yeasts to determine the risk of yeast infection after exposure to the river water 2 9 1 exposure assessment clinical studies quantifying the infectivity of yeast species via common exposure routes such as skin contact and aerosol inhalation are not available in literature we therefore identified direct ingestion followed by gut translocation of the yeast as the exposure route for infection by pathogenic yeasts occurring in river water species specific exposure doses eq 1 were calculated for accidental 1 ml day and intentional 100 ml day ingestion abia et al 2016 using the following equation 1 d e x p o s u r e v i n g e s t i o n c c o n t a m i n a n t the total daily ingestion of the water source is represented by the volume ingested v i n g e s t i o n while the species specific yeast concentration is represented by the contaminant concentration c c o n t a m i n a n t the latter was calculated by determining total thermotolerant yeast counts on the filter disks that were incubated on the sda plates then by identification of random isolates from the disks tables s3 9 yeast cell concentrations were subsequently calculated with the assumption that one yeast colony would represent approximately 1 106 cells joseph and hall 2004 and log transformed to normalize the data table s10 yeast concentration results obtained from hp and lp sites were pooled respectively 2 9 2 dose response parameter proxies since no clinical dose response models currently exist for pathogenic yeasts the above mentioned pp was used as a proxy to determine the probability of infection the pp was calculated according to the method of casadevall 2017 using eq 2 2 p p f s i 10 m where f s fraction of affected individuals that show symptoms of infection i infecting inoculum cells m fraction of death outcomes amongst infected individuals using this equation we determined the pps of alternative pathogenic microbes bacteria protozoa and viruses to compare with the dose response model parameter k estimate used in exponential qmra frameworks of the corresponding pathogens and consequently found that they were comparable table s11 we then determined the pp of seven clinically relevant yeasts table 2 in preparation for provisional qmra for six of these seven yeast species to determine the daily risk of yeast infection p i n f e c t i o n d weiskerger and brandão 2020 a modification of the exponential dose response model eq 3 was used in this study whereby k was replaced by pp eq 4 3 p i n f e c t i o n 1 e k d e x p o s u r e 4 p i n f e c t i o n d 1 e p p d e x p o s u r e the annual risk of infection p i n f e c t i o n a was subsequently determined using the following equation 5 p i n f e c t i o n a 1 1 p i n f e c t i o n d 365 the following assumptions were made while conducting the qmra during this study a individuals accidentally and or intentionally ingesting natural surface water do so on a daily basis b wild type and clinical yeast strains would react similarly upon exposure to the host individuals c isolation at 37 c mimics the immediate stress a yeast is exposed to inside the host d translocation of the yeast from the intestines into the bloodstream occurs post ingestion in order to cause infection hirayama et al 2020 zhai et al 2020 and e the murine model used in yeast virulence studies adequately mimics human host conditions for the purpose of this study risk of infection was determined for river water of significantly different quality hp and lp 3 results 3 1 water quality analysis the mean values of the physicochemical parameters investigated for water quality analysis of lp and hp sites are presented in table 3 no significant difference in ph was observed between the two groups river water temperature was significantly higher at hp sites p 0 002 additionally significantly higher conductivity p 0 0001 cod p 0 0001 and ammonia concentrations p 0 0003 were observed at hp sites compared with lp sites the do concentrations of the river water were significantly lower at hp sites than that of lp sites p 0 0001 the mean values of e coli and coliform concentrations for lp and hp sites are depicted in fig 2 concentrations of both e coli and coliforms were significantly higher at hp sites than at lp sites p 0 0001 3 2 fungal diversity the relationships of fungal community composition represented by relative abundance as determined using pacbio sequencing data between different sites is presented in fig 3 the fungal communities of less polluted lp and highly polluted hp sites differed significantly p 0 007 fungal community analyses indicated that the most predominant phylum detected at all sites was ascomycota three other major phyla were also detected namely rozellomycota previously cryptomycota basidiomycota and chytridiomycota twenty genera from these phyla that may harbour opportunistic and pathogenic fungal strains were detected at an overall relative abundance of 0 91 fig 4 a significantly higher relative abundance of pathogen representing genera was observed at hp sites compared to lp sites p 0 038 3 3 occurrence of thermotolerant yeasts in river water the mean yeast concentrations cfu 100 ml for lp and hp sites are depicted in fig 2 the experimental period encompassed all seasons

2021 compared to the observed yeast concentrations of the remaining sampling months table 1 fig s7 aside from a weak negative correlation to cod r 0 103 overall thermotolerant yeast concentrations did not correlate with any of the other measured physicochemical parameters in this study 3 4 yeast identification thermotolerant representatives of 42 different yeast species were isolated from the river

included e coli and total coliform counts total thermotolerant yeast concentrations as well as the concentrations of the most frequently 10 isolated yeast species the analysis involved multiple linear regression and principal component analysis to construct an ordination biplot demonstrating the associations between the different parameters fig 5 the biplot collectively represents 87 14 of the

ingestion for four of the six yeast species in lp waters and all six species in hp waters are presented in table 5 the risk values for c albicans and c tropicalis detected in hp sites only were considerably higher than those of c glabrata c lusitaniae m guilliermondii and p kudriavzevii despite lower observed concentration in the river water amongst the four species detected at both lp and hp sites c glabrata had the highest risk values on the other hand the lowest risk values were observed for m guilliermondii and p kudriavzevii in all cases excluding m guilliermondii risk of infection increased by at least 20 at hp sites compared with risk of infection at lp sites 4 discussion exposure to polluted waters has negative effects on human health especially due to harmful microorganisms proliferating in the nutrient rich conditions schwarzenbach et al 2010 various disease causing bacteria have been identified in the plankenbrug and surrounding rivers investigated in our study highlighting the existing health risks associated with these waters ackermann 2010 barnes and taylor 2004 the presence of clinically relevant yeasts in these rivers however was only considered by a few postma 2016 stone et al 2012 using culture based methods and high throughput sequencing our study revealed the presence of various yeast species tables 4 s14 as well as genera fig 4 that represent opportunistic and pathogenic members in polluted river water fungi have been detected in polluted rivers as early as the 1970 s where ascomycetous yeasts such as candida spp predominated waters contaminated with domestic pollutants woollett and hedrick 1970 this is in accordance with our recurrent detection of candida spp in river water characterised by high levels of faecal contamination indicated by the presence of e coli and coliforms additionally other studies have shown that yeast members of ascomycota and basidiomycota dominated river microbiomes during which candida spp were amongst the frequently detected opportunistic and pathogenic members in anthropogenically influenced waters brandão et al 2021 coelho et al 2010 monapathi et al 2020 pietryczuk et al 2018 our results corroborate these findings and have linked the opportunistic yeast species c lusitaniae and c glabrata with pollution indicators moreover the genus clavispora was not detected in lp sites during fungal community analysis further supporting the indicator potential of c lusitaniae fig 4 while not investigated here emerging contaminants such as edcs may also be amongst the pollutants that are associated with clinically relevant yeasts as some yeasts harbour receptors for these compounds jarque et al 2016 iuele et al 2022 it is therefore essential that this potential correlation be explored amongst specific species such as c lusitaniae and c glabrata due to their association with pollution observed in our study total thermotolerant yeast species on the other hand should not be considered since no significant difference was observed between total thermotolerant yeast concentrations of lp and hp sites fig 2 although significant differences in site specific yeast concentrations were observed in the dry months of summer these concentrations were significantly increased at all sites irrespective of pollution level during rainy months fig s7 the increased yeast concentrations correlated strongly with the presence of m guilliermondii r 0 999 an ascomycetous opportunistic yeast that dominated the culturable yeast populations following thermally selective isolation figs s11 13 to elucidate this observation additional experimentation was conducted which indicated that m guilliermondii was a slow grower under static medium conditions µmax 0 0046 od595 h while the controls p kudriavzevii strains showed a µmax 0 0132 od595 h however when the medium was agitated the maximum growth rate of m guilliermondii increased to 0 0793 od595 h which was comparable to that of the p kudriavzevii strains µmax 0 0884 od595 h when incubated under similar conditions fig s14 increased turbulence and oxygen concentrations in the river robustly resembling the conditions in agitated media could therefore have provided a competitive advantage to m guilliermondii resulting in a bloom of this species in the river water during and after rainfall moreover the versatile metabolism of this yeast might grant competitive advantages under limited but diverse nutrient conditions mo et al 2021 yan et al 2021 interestingly other studies have noted contrasting results concerning the influence of water turbulence and oxygen levels on yeast concentrations ortiz vera et al 2018 woollett and hedrick 1970 however our study selectively enumerated thermotolerant yeasts and excluded the mesophiles as such the comparably low relative abundance of the genus meyerozyma detected during fungal community analysis no selective pressure applied contradicted the corresponding high m guilliermondii concentrations observed following thermally selective isolation fig 4 while our isolation method does not consider other host conditions that may influence the viable populations of yeasts thermal restriction serves as an appropriate selective measure to enumerate the potentially opportunistic yeast species that are capable of surviving within an endothermic host such as humans amongst the other thermally tolerant yeasts isolated in this study were renowned yeast species such as c albicans c tropicalis c glabrata p kudriavzevii and l elongisporus these yeasts are causative agents of invasive infections that can potentially be fatal cooper 2011 additionally we detected clinically relevant yeasts that have not been reported to be present in river water prior to this study candida melibiosica candida pseudoaaseri c mucoides cyberlindnera jadinii kodamaea ohmeri p kluyveri and wickerhamomyces onychis their reason for occurrence in the river water remains undefined however considering the increase in emergence of opportunistic yeasts in clinical facilities miceli et al 2011 it is possible these yeasts were introduced to the river water via domestic waste it is noteworthy that we did not detect candida auris a multi drug resistant and clinically emergent yeast however its recent isolation from marine environments suggest that this yeast might be more adapted to saline conditions and is outcompeted in fresh waters arora et al 2021 magobo et al 2014 the presence of fluconazole resistant yeast species in the river water might also be derived from human waste entering the river or is a result of acquired resistance towards pharmaceutical contaminants present in the water assress et al 2020 fisher et al 2022 the occurrence and exposure to these antifungal resistant yeasts nonetheless increase morbidity risks and challenge favourable clinical outcomes in patients perlin et al 2017 moreover the presence of these yeasts could potentially increase the annual risk of infection mitigating disease risks often requires quantitative intervention by conducting qmras smeets et al 2010 previously qmras on river water have demonstrated the risk of infection by bacteria viruses and parasites federigi et al 2019 albeit mostly for recreational use recently the world health organisation who released a report on prioritising fungal pathogens in future research who 2022 we report here for the first time the risk of infection by six clinically relevant yeast species four of which were prioritised by the who through accidental intentional ingestion of river water our results indicate that risk of infection positively associates with pollution levels excluding the findings for m guilliermondii which presented a uniform distribution of concentration however it should be noted that the microbial blooms of m guilliermondii suggest that environmental conditions might affect the risk distribution of infections by yeasts this underscores the importance of developing probability distributions for contaminant concentrations in qmra rather than using single average or median values it also suggests that the eco physiology of yeasts may play a significant role in future qmras uncertainty and sensitivity analyses limitations of the provisional qmra framework presented here include the lack of correction factors for infectivity due to limited clinical data and non dynamic modelling that only produces a snapshot of the risks associated with ingestion of river water additional studies surveying community health conditions and usage of river water would be necessary for more dynamic qmra modelling of yeast infections a previous study detailing the use and quality of water in rural communities for example indicated that different sources of water were used at varying frequencies across seasons due to rainfall reduced water access and inconsistencies in municipal water supply edokpayi et al 2018 conducting similar studies on river water usage could greatly contribute to future qmras of yeast infections to realistically express the presumed seasonally variable health threat faced by immunocompromised individuals 5 conclusion the health threats posed by viral parasitological and bacterial microorganisms in polluted river water have been evaluated however the risks pertaining to fungal pathogens remain unclear our understanding of exposure to these microorganisms is largely based on reports of their occurrence in clinical and natural settings and lack a substantial link to public health and infection risk severity this could hamper future exposure management diagnosis and treatment strategies which negatively affects the immunocompromised population countries such as south africa which have a disproportionally large population of immunocompromised people due to the hiv are particularly vulnerable to these risks our findings indicate the presence of known opportunistic yeast species that could potentially increase fungal infection cases for individuals that rely on natural water sources moreover the provisional risk assessment results suggest that infection risks increase with pollution levels and certain yeast species such as c albicans might cause greater harm than others irrespective of lower observed concentrations our study clearly highlights the need for river water remediation and mycosis risk management however it also emphasises the need for additional research to enhance the provisional qmra of yeast infections to address population and environmental characteristics that might alter risk estimations overall we highlight the underrated threat posed by opportunistic and pathogenic yeast species through water exposure and underscore the necessary research gaps that would refine our understanding of this threat to public health credit authorship contribution statement heidi christa steffen investigation formal analysis writing original draft
