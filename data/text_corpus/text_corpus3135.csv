15675,high levels of e coli and associated faecal microbes in waterways as a result of agricultural and residential land use can pose environmental human health and economic risks this study aims to understand the impacts of land use climatic variables and riparian buffers on in stream e coli concentrations flow temperature and e coli were monitored during three sampling campaigns within eleven independent catchments these catchments have varying land use and extents of riparian buffer coverage results showed that catchments with predominantly agricultural and residential land uses average 349 7 mpn 100 ml had higher e coli concentrations than predominantly forested catchments average 111 8 mpn 100 ml however there were no statistically significant differences in e coli concentrations between the agricultural and residential land uses riparian buffers appear to reduce e coli concentrations in streams as indicated by significant negative correlations between in stream e coli concentrations with the riparian buffer areal coverage pearson s r 0 95 spearman s ρ 0 90 and the ratio of buffer length to stream length pearson s r 0 87 spearman s ρ 0 90 we find that riparian buffers potentially disrupt transport pathways that govern e coli movement which in turn can affect the concentration discharge relationship this reinforces the importance of protecting and restoring riparian buffers along drainage lines in agricultural and rural residential catchments to improve downstream microbial water quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords riparian buffers e coli rural land use spatio temporal variation 1 introduction poor water quality in rivers and lakes is a major issue worldwide obilonu et al 2013 having been associated with fish kills human illness loss of biodiversity and various socio economic problems specifically faecal pollution and associated microbial pathogens in rural catchments are problematic as they can increase the cost of water treatment and pose public health risks dearmont et al 1998 li and wu 2019 faecal pollution in waterways can have a number of sources in rural catchments for instance manure produced by stock or used in field applications in cropping areas can be washed into streams during wet weather hubbard et al 2004 waste effluents from wild animals both native and invasive and humans leaking septic tanks can also cause faecal pollution to aquatic systems the level of faecal pollution in waterways is often assessed using faecal indicator organisms fio because 1 their levels are high in sewage and faecal samples 2 are related to the presence of pathogens 3 are cheap and easy to measure and 4 have low pathogenic safety risk harwood et al 2014 mccarthy et al 2012 in relation to that escherichia coli e coli is one of the most commonly used fio due to the improved detection methods for e coli and e coli being able to provide a more faeces specific indicator than the other faecal coliforms griffith et al 2009 odonkor and ampofo 2013 total catchment land use may be a good predictor of e coli concentrations in streams this was suggested in the findings of nakhle et al 2021 which demonstrated a negative correlation between in stream e coli concentrations with the percentage of forested area due to high infiltration rates and contaminant trapping efficiencies and low levels of soil erosion conversely rural residential land has been associated with increased e coli concentrations e g mccarthy et al 2007 the association between rural residential land use and e coli concentrations can be due to the pollutants from anthropogenic sources including failing septic systems chen and chang 2014 rochelle newall et al 2016 in addition livestock grazing activities are frequently reported to increase nutrient and sediment export to streams in catchments dominated by agricultural activities e g blackburn 1984 schepers and francis 1982 wood and blackburn 1981 indirectly this can also lead to an increase in pathogen levels in waterways as bacteria are generally associated with these sediments davies and bavor 2000 phiri et al 2020 swaffer et al 2018 although the impact of different land uses on the concentrations of e coli have been well documented in rural catchments these studies were mainly focused on fixed frequency monitoring fixed frequency monitoring is a sampling regime which collects water samples at regular fixed intervals such as weekly or monthly intervals kerr et al 2018 this sampling method has been shown to have limitations particularly associated with the capture of wet weather events this can make subsequent analysis challenging as dry or wet weather water samples are difficult to distinguish in comparison to targeted event or campaign based sampling furthermore for fixed frequency monitoring changes in e coli levels may not be adequately captured during and between storm events mccarthy et al 2007 to help mitigate faecal pollution best management practices bmps have been used in rural catchments to reduce the impact of human activities riparian buffers also known as vegetative or grass filter strips are a commonly used bmp they can be described as vegetated zones adjacent to waterways to promote the growth of riparian buffers fencing of riparian areas is often used as a method to prevent stock access riparian buffers are capable of removing nutrients sediments and microbes from runoff baumhardt and blanco canqui 2014 jose et al 2012 thevathasan et al 2012 for example sunohara et al 2012 found that excluding stock with fencing and establishing a 5 10 m wide buffer strip at either side of a stream reduced the load of e coli coyne et al 1995 found that riparian buffers were able to remove up to 74 of faecal coliforms from runoff while tate pereira atwill 2004 showed that riparian buffers are able to achieve a mean log10 reduction of more than 1 for the total cryptosporidium parvum flux per metre of riparian buffer cardoso et al 2012 also demonstrated that riparian buffers are able to reduce bacterial e coli and salmonella runoff from swine manure slurry as compared to bare soil while these studies reported large reductions in concentrations and loads of bacteria through the use of riparian buffers most were conducted under controlled settings through the use of small plots soil boxes and simulated rainfall events rather than catchment scale studies that test the impact of best management practices in natural conditions brennan et al 2013 coyne et al 1995 korajkic et al 2014 additionally these studies did not investigate the effectiveness of riparian buffers under both dry and wet weather conditions and in different seasons previous studies have also demonstrated that the size of the riparian buffers can impact the level of stream water quality there are several studies that have investigated the impact of buffer width on the efficacy of bacteria removal however those studies neglected the impact of buffer length stanford et al 2020 for the studies which focused on the impact of buffer length none assessed the impact of buffer length on e coli concentrations and mostly focused on stream ecology physical and chemical parameters such as ph temperature dissolved oxygen conductivity and nutrients de oliveira et al 2016 hilary et al 2021 iñiguez armijos et al 2014 an understanding of the relationship between buffer sizes and e coli removal is essential for designing optimum sizes of riparian buffers to minimise faecal pollution risks particularly associated with agricultural run off escherichia coli concentrations vary temporally within catchments key factors affecting temporal e coli variability include presence of other microorganisms and biofilms exogenous survival ability variability of faecal deposition patterns from animals availability of water and nutrients temperature solar radiation and ph ferguson et al 2003 hansen et al 2020 jang et al 2017 specifically in rural streams hydrologic and climatological variables such as discharge as a result of rainfall and antecedent air temperature are often related to e coli concentrations many studies have shown that e coli concentrations generally increase with discharge during storm events hathaway et al 2015 kelsey et al 2004 this is due to the wash off process where e coli get mobilised and transported to the stream during rainfall antecedent air temperature can also result in variability in e coli concentration between rainfall events mccarthy et al 2007 in temperate regions the bacterium survives at lower temperatures and as temperatures increase e coli can become inactivated as a result of desiccation and solar radiation crane and moore 1986 ferguson et al 2003 vermeulen and hofstra 2014 whilst these drivers of temporal e coli variability are well studied the impacts of riparian buffers strips on these known relationships remain poorly understood with the introduction of riparian buffers e coli from overland flow can be filtered and retained during storm events which may potentially affect concentration discharge and concentration temperature relationships over time therefore the aim of this study is to understand the spatio temporal variability of e coli concentrations within mixed land use catchments with varying degrees of riparian buffer coverage specifically this study investigated relationships between the presence of varied degrees of riparian buffers in rural catchments and climatic and hydrologic variables specifically antecedent air temperature and discharge through the application of campaign based sampling the specific objectives were to determine 1 how land use in rural catchments is associated with e coli concentrations and how this relationship varies between dry and wet weather 2 how riparian buffers affect the concentration of e coli in streams whether the effect of riparian buffers on e coli concentrations in streams varies between dry and wet weather and 3 the effect of discharge and antecedent air temperature on e coli and whether this effect varies between different catchments based on their land use and riparian buffer coverage 2 methodology 2 1 catchment information and site characteristics the study catchment incorporating the tarago river system has an area of 11 400 ha and is located southeast of melbourne victoria australia the catchment was chosen as it has a variety of rural land uses such as forest residential areas and agricultural farmlands mostly dairy and beef cows the two main tributaries in the study catchment figure 1 are the west tarago river mt3 which makes up 63 of the catchment and consists mostly of state forest and the east tarago river catchment which consists of mixed land use such as horticultural and livestock farmlands and townships including neerim and nayook the tarago catchment has an annual rainfall of 953 mm melbourne water 2017 there were 11 monitoring sites established in 2016 within the catchment table 1 these covered the three main tributaries and eight other sites covering catchments with contrasting land use and cover of riparian buffers the land use s of the catchment of each monitoring site were classified using the victorian land use information system morse mcnabb et al 2015 and further verified using site surveys and satellite images sites with riparian buffers whether partially or fully buffered were identified using spatial datasets on revegetated areas from the local catchment management authority and further verified through visual inspection during fieldwork table 1 in addition the length and average width of the riparian buffers relative to the stream length for the small sub catchments were identified using spatial datasets from the local catchment management authority including shapefiles of riparian buffers and reaches of each catchment table 2 many of the riparian buffers were older than 10 years and were well established all riparian buffers in the site were planted using a mix of native species and were fenced to prevent stock access to the buffer zone and stream channel the overstorey included eucalyptus sp and larger acacias including melanoxylon and mearnsii mid stories consisted of native shrubs including but not limited to acacia solanum laciniatum prostanthera lasianthos leptospermum and cassinia while the understories were a mix of native and introduced ground cover species including but not limited to rubus parvifolius lolium perenne carex appressa lomandra longifolio juncus sp and paspalum distichum 2 2 data collection and preparation three water quality monitoring campaigns that each lasted 3 days were conducted between 2018 and 2019 table 3 at eight sites a sensor campbell scientific sdi 12 cs 451 measured water level and water temperature in the pool of a weir 90 v notch stainless steel weir plate 2 mm thick discharge was calculated using the standard equation for 900 v notch weirs standards australia 1991 water level calculated flow and temperature were recorded by a logger campbell scientific either cr300 or cr800 models at 1 minute intervals water level measurements were periodically checked against a manual measurement made using a staff gauge gauging stations were cleaned prior to each monitoring campaign to ensure that there were no blockages in the weir at the end of the collection period 1 minute data were aggregated into 6 minute intervals by averaging across the corresponding six time steps flow data at the sites of mt1 mt2 and mt3 were collected by melbourne water at recording intervals of 1 hour and downloaded from melbourne water s website where they are publicly available melbourne water 2021 a weather station within the catchment figure 1 measured temperature wind speed relative humidity solar radiation and rainfall depth at an interval of 6 minutes during each campaign 125 ml samples were collected in sterilised 1 l bottles at intervals of 15 minutes from each of the 11 sites until a volume of 1 l was reached therefore one 1 l bottle was filled every two hours using variants of sigma 900 autosamplers autosamplers were pre programmed for sampling to start at 8 am prior to the day of collection and to continue for 72 hours which resulted in a minimum of 36 bottles for each campaign for sampling campaign 1 sc1 did not have any flow while for sampling campaigns 1 2 and 3 sc8 did not have any flow as such only 10 monitoring sites were included in the data analysis in each campaign filled bottles were removed daily from the autosampler and transported on ice apart from campaign 1 where the bottles were transported at ambient temperature in insulated boxes within 4 hours of collection to the environmental public health microbiology laboratory ephm lab at monash university for e coli analysis concentrations of e coli were measured using the colilert method idexx laboratories 2013 as described by the manufacturer with either 5 dilution factor used 0 1 or 10 mpn 100 ml dilution factor used 0 05 as the limit of detection from this we obtained pollutographs of e coli across three days at each of the 10 sites for the 3 campaigns which consist of 322 e coli concentration data points from buffered sites 262 from unbuffered sites and 251 from the main tributaries 2 3 data analysis e coli concentrations were categorised into wet and dry weather data through a baseflow separation process using the lyne and hollick filter ladson et al 2013 an α filter parameter of 0 95 and 15 passes were adopted for baseflow separation for all the sites during the baseflow separation process a 30 buffer was applied due to the uncertainties of streamflow after considering the fact that most of the sites are small in area other than the three main tributaries the rest of the sites having an area of 63 ha and low in streamflow 0 074 mm h as such it was considered that if a streamflow value is lower than 1 3 times the baseflow value that particular value will be considered as dry weather flow ahyerre et al 1998 harmel et al 2016 mccarthy et al 2008 since the collected samples were composite samples collected over a 2 hour period a sample was classified as a dry or wet weather sample depending on the number of flow data points that were considered as wet within the 2 hour sample collection period for each 2 hour sample collection period main tributaries have two flow data points and others have 20 flow data points this is due to differences in the temporal resolution of flow data as flow data for main tributaries were collected in 1 hour intervals while flow data for other catchments were collected in 1 minute intervals and subsequently aggregated into 6 minute intervals a sample was classified as dry only if more than half of the flow points recorded in that sample s 2 hour collection period were classified as dry conversely whenever a dry sample was identified after a rainfall event i e samples transitioned from wet to dry weather sample in a baseflow separation curve all following samples were classified as dry only if it was entirely collected more than twice the time of concentration after the last recorded rainfall through looking at the data from tipping bucket rain gauge on site the time of concentration was estimated using equation 1 as proposed by mcdermott pilgrim 1982 due to its suitability for catchments under 250 km2 in victoria while the factor of two was used based on the conservative assumption that by this period surface runoff from previous rainfall would have all travelled to the outlet fang et al 2008 equation 1 t c h 0 76 a 0 38 where a is in km2 and tc is in hours subsequent data analyses were conducted through the use of several python libraries pandas v0 24 2 was used to create and manage the data frame numpy v1 16 4 was used in the concatenation of data scipy v1 2 1 was used for statistical analyses while matplotlib v3 1 0 and seaborn v0 9 0 were used for data visualisation purposes to investigate the effects of land use on e coli concentrations in streams boxplots of all e coli concentrations i e from all three campaigns from all 10 monitoring sites were constructed and the kruskal wallis k w test α 0 05 kruskal and wallis 1952 was used to determine whether there were statistically significant differences in e coli concentrations between sites dunn s post hoc tests were then used with α 0 05 dunn 1961 to check which sites were significantly different from each other these statistically significant differences were further analysed to see if they could be explained by the land use of each catchment subsequently the k w test α 0 05 kruskal and wallis 1952 was used to determine whether the relationship between land use and e coli concentrations differed between dry and wet weather events more detailed indicators of land use were explored in particular the number of houses and housing density in each catchment to assess the potential impact of human wastewater via septic tanks on e coli concentrations sowah et al 2014 in addition the relationships between e coli concentration and several unique natural catchment characteristics were investigated namely average catchment slope catchment area and catchment length which have been previously associated with spatial differences in water quality botter et al 2019 lintern et al 2018 phiri et al 2020 all of these parameters were analysed by plotting boxplots of e coli concentrations and using pearson s correlation i e pearson s r freedman et al 2007 and spearman s rank order correlation i e spearman s ρ spearman 2010 to identify if there were any trends between the above mentioned parameters and e coli concentrations median e coli concentrations at each site were used for pearson s correlation and spearman s rank order correlation analyses subsequently e coli concentrations measured in streams where the catchments contain buffers regardless of partial or fully buffered were first compared against those in catchments without buffers k w tests α 0 05 were then used to check if the differences in the e coli concentration were statistically significant the e coli concentrations were then categorised into measurements that were taken during dry weather events and those that were taken during wet weather events the impact of buffers on e coli concentrations under both dry weather and wet weather was also determined furthermore the relationship between the proportion of catchment buffered the ratio of buffer length to stream length and buffer width were explored against the median concentrations of e coli at each site overall median e coli concentrations of unbuffered sites were also included through the use of pearson s correlation freedman et al 2007 and spearman s rank order correlation spearman 2010 lastly to investigate the potential impacts of discharge and temperature on temporal change in e coli concentrations concentration discharge plots godsey et al 2009 rose et al 2018 of e coli for each site were constructed which combined data from all campaigns using data that were classified according to campaigns concentration discharge c q plots were first constructed for all monitoring sites with both axes log transformed then the relationship between e coli concentration and discharge was further investigated through identifying the log transformed linear regression slopes of c q plots musolff et al 2015 these slopes were used to understand whether the same temporal patterns are present for the catchments with similar catchment characteristics i e similar land use and presence absence of riparian buffers similar methods were also used to examine the relationship between e coli concentration and temperature by first constructing concentration temperature c t plots with both axes log transformed and then identifying the log transformed linear regression slopes of c t plots the temperature data used were 48 hours average antecedent air temperature climatic conditions recommended by mccarthy et al 2013 before the midpoint of sampling period 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli concentrations in dry and wet weather throughout all the sampling campaigns the concentrations of e coli ranged from 5 mpn 100 ml which is below the detection limit to 10 358 mpn 100 ml sc3 standard deviation 1325 2 mpn 100 ml table s1 the flow ranged from 0 00004 mm h sc3 to 0 074 mm h mt3 table s1 for 5 out of the 10 sites figure s1 sc1 sc2 sc5 mt1 and mt2 there was a significant difference k w test p 0 05 in e coli concentrations between dry and wet events the behaviour of these five sites aligned with findings from the studies of buckerfield et al 2019 islam et al 2017 and wu et al 2009 where wet weather e coli concentrations were generally higher than that of dry weather e coli concentrations however for the rest of the sites sc3 sc4 sc6 sc7 and mt3 we did not find a significant difference in e coli concentrations between dry and wet events this was not expected as similar studies conducted by buckerfield et al 2019 in catchments with a high proportion of agricultural land use had found that the wet weather e coli concentrations were one to three magnitudes higher than that of dry weather e coli concentration further analysis indicated that the lack of differences in e coli concentrations between dry and wet weather were not related to the amount of agricultural land use in the catchment figure 2 we hypothesise that there was no significant difference in e coli concentrations between dry and wet events due to the time of year when these campaigns occurred the wet weather samples were mainly taken in june whilst the dry weather samples were taken in october and december previous studies have shown that e coli concentrations in streams are not only affected by the magnitude of streamflow they can also be affected by the time of year of sampling due to the timing of agricultural practices and local management practices such as stock rotations and grazing timing wagner et al 2012 for example in our case as a result of high rainfall during the winter farmers may be less likely to graze steeper streamside paddocks due to accessibility issues which may hypothetically reduce faecal loadings at streamsides furthermore at different times of the year environmental factors such as temperature solar radiation hydraulic loading and antecedent soil moistures differ deletic and fletcher 2006 mccarthy et al 2011 šolić and krstulović 1992 there is also very likely to be substantial variability in local surface microclimates between sites due to differences such as vegetation coverage and effect resulting from the direction the catchment is facing e g in tarago catchment south facing slopes will be colder in general these factors are able to affect the inactivation and survival rates of e coli which can influence the levels and temporal variability of e coli 3 2 impacts of land use on e coli concentrations a comparison between the land use at each site and e coli concentrations demonstrated a statistically significant p 0 05 k w test result from dunn s post hoc analysis in table s2 difference between e coli in fully forested streams mt3 and the other catchments average 111 8 mpn 100 ml this was expected as previous studies have shown that forests remove e coli through promoting effective soil infiltration miyata et al 2009 in addition there is likely to be lower deposition of e coli in forested catchments due to the absence of agricultural activities as agricultural catchments are likely to have much higher faecal direct deposition rates due to condensed animal stocking as compared to forested catchments and human effluent sources septic tanks however in forested areas wild animals can be a potential source of e coli as previous studies have found that it is common to observe wild animals being a major contributor of faecal pollution in a forested catchment chandran and mazumder 2015 other than for forested catchments land use did not demonstrate an obvious relationship with measured e coli concentrations figure 2 in addition neither the number of houses in the catchment or the housing density were found to have a significant correlation with e coli figures s2 to s3 the lack of a relationship between land use and e coli concentrations was evident in both the overall concentrations and when data were separated between dry and wet weather events figure s1 furthermore there appeared to be no association between e coli concentrations and catchment characteristics such as slope size and length table s3 figures s4 to s6 we hypothesise that these findings are due to both agricultural and residential land uses containing a range of potential e coli sources for example in catchments with a high proportion of agricultural land use including livestock farming high e coli concentrations in streams can be expected e g murphy et al 2015 petersen et al 2018 rochelle newall et al 2016 in our case this is likely due to direct deposition or wash off of cow faecal matter furthermore disturbance of streams due to cattle further promotes mobilisation of sediments to which e coli can be adsorbed davies and bavor 2000 on the other hand for catchments with high residential land use which are also unsewered in this catchment septic tanks can act as sources of e coli to streams this is due to the fact that septic systems can act as a non point source of faecal pollutants sowah et al 2014 in addition previous studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between septic system density and pollution levels in streams mallin and mciver 2012 sowah et al 2014 importantly although it was known that agricultural rural residential and forested land uses are potential sources of e coli the use of modern source apportionment methods such as microbial source tracking through microbial communities e g henry et al 2016 mccarthy et al 2017 may better confirm the origins and contribution amount of faecal pollution in each catchment 3 3 performance and impacts of riparian buffers on e coli concentrations catchments with riparian buffers were found to have statistically significant lower e coli concentrations median 46 6 mpn 100 ml than unbuffered catchments median 255 1 mpn 100 ml figure 3 p 0 05 k w test similarly e coli concentrations within mt3 median 52 mpn 100 ml entirely forested catchment was found to be significantly p 0 05 k w test lower than that of mt1 median 126 1 mpn 100 ml mixed land use partially forested in combination these findings show that the presence of streamside vegetation in the form of riparian buffers from which stock have been excluded due to fencing of riparian areas is capable of reducing e coli concentrations in streams the results also showed that e coli concentrations were significantly lower in the buffered catchments dry median concentration 51 6 mpn 100 ml wet median concentration 41 6 mpn 100 ml than unbuffered catchments dry median concentration 255 1 mpn 100 ml wet median concentration 258 mpn 100 ml figure 3 irrespective of dry or wet weather conditions p 0 05 k w test several studies have reported that buffers are capable of removing microbes from runoff during wet weather events cardoso et al 2012 coyne et al 1995 tate et al 2004 and that fenced riparian buffers can reduce microbe exports during dry weather low flow conditions sunohara et al 2012 however mechanisms of removal are likely to be different during each condition for example during dry weather it is hypothesised that observed decreases in e coli concentrations are a result of the exclusion of livestock from the riparian zone miller et al 2010 wilcock et al 2013 during wet weather in addition to the removal of readily mobilizable faeces from the buffered area due to stock exclusion riparian buffers likely also function by passively filtering overland flow capturing slowing and removing e coli prior to transportation into local streams xue et al 2018 this hypothesis was supported by the data for wet weather events where it was observed that buffered strips had lower median e coli concentrations 41 6 mpn 100 ml than that of dry weather 51 6 mpn 100 ml figure 3 this finding contrasts to those studies done in agricultural dominant mixed land use settings which found that wet weather e coli concentrations were much higher than that of dry weather buckerfield et al 2019 islam et al 2017 therefore this supports a role for riparian buffers as a bmp that is highly efficient in mitigating faecal pollution in waterways importantly the e coli removal capacity of riparian buffers can also be improved through optimisation of size this was demonstrated through statistically significant negative correlations pearson s r 0 95 spearman s ρ 0 90 between the percentage of catchment area buffered and the concentrations of e coli figure 4 apart from that there is also a strong significant negative relationship pearson s r 0 87 spearman s ρ 0 90 between the ratio of buffer length to stream length and e coli concentrations table s3 these findings agree with those of hilary et al 2021 where the longer the length of buffer the greater the improvement of water quality there was no significant relationship between riparian buffer width and e coli concentrations table s3 however all the analysed buffered sites have already complied with the recommended minimum average riparian buffer width of roughly 15 m table 2 by hilary et al 2021 which found that narrow minimum of 15 m and long riparian buffers are most effective in protecting water quality our findings suggest that instead of just applying a standard minimum riparian buffer width it is also important to also consider the length of the riparian buffers these relationships while based on only median e coli concentrations of four buffered sites and overall median e coli concentrations of unbuffered sites suggests that there is a benefit in scaling the width and length of riparian buffers to the total catchment rather than applying a standard minimum amount of riparian buffers in order to maximise the water quality protection for receiving waters furthermore the relationships in table s3 can potentially be interpreted to construct a simple e coli regression model 3 4 impact of rainfall discharge and antecedent air temperature on e coli the concentration discharge c q relationship slopes table 4 for e coli concentrations were found to be statistically significantly positive p 0 05 for unbuffered sites sc2 sc3 sc4 and buffered site mt3 a positive c q slope signifies that flushing and transport via surface runoff is the dominant process controlling concentrations of e coli in the tarago catchment godsey et al 2009 most studies have shown that e coli concentrations generally increase during storm events and are correlated with rainfall intensity hathaway et al 2015 stea et al 2015 due to the e coli in the surface store that gets washed off and transported to receiving waters mccarthy et al 2011 the result table 4 suggests that riparian buffers may be the reason behind the non significance of the c q slopes from buffered catchments this may be due to the fact that riparian buffers disrupt the transport pathways that govern e coli movement which reduces the amount of e coli transported thereby interrupting relationships between discharge and e coli concentrations for buffered catchments in regard to the impact of antecedent air temperature on e coli concentrations there were 8 sites with significant c t relationship slopes p 0 05 figure s9 and table 4 among these 8 sites 5 of them had a positive c t slope while the other 3 had a negative c t slope based on the results our findings on the impact of antecedent air temperature on e coli concentrations were inconclusive we suspect that there is a combination of factors apart from antecedent air temperature e g vapour pressure nutrient levels relative humidity ph local soil microbiota management practices and surface microclimate that vary seasonally which affects the growth and inactivation of e coli hathaway et al 2010 and impact the c t relationship slopes the magnitude and significance of the log log c q and log log c t slopes did not vary with land use type table s4 and other considered variables catchment area slope housing density number of houses and catchment length the variability in these relationships could be due to varying numbers of wild animals and stock in each catchment during different time periods the soil type presence or absence of riparian buffers soil erosion dynamics and temporal patterns in stock rotations whilst this preliminary analysis suggests that the presence or absence of riparian buffers may be driving the significance of the c q slopes further monitoring and detailed modelling of the catchment are likely required to confirm this for c q slopes and identify the underlying factors of spatial variability in the c q and c t slopes 3 5 management implications of this study there are a number of important management implications from this study firstly regardless of residential or agricultural land use it seems that agricultural and rural residential development can potentially increase the concentrations of e coli in runoff secondly and most importantly riparian buffers are capable of reducing the concentrations of e coli in the non forested catchments during both wet and dry weather most likely through the physical direct stock exclusion and biological removal of e coli processes from overland flow pathways however reducing e coli concentrations also depends on the scale of riparian buffer implementation our monitoring and analyses suggest that it is not merely the presence or absence of riparian buffers but also the proportion of the catchment area that they occupy which can impact water quality particularly we found that increasing the proportion of the catchment area covered by riparian buffers and ratio of buffer length to stream length correlate to lower e coli concentrations in catchments with both agricultural land uses and rural residences while we have not explicitly connected these relationships to a specific formula we believe this information can potentially be used to construct a simple e coli regression model 4 conclusion agricultural and residential land uses were found to have higher e coli concentrations compared to forested areas this suggests that agricultural activities as well as the presence of rural residences can act as a major source of e coli in waterways none of the other catchment characteristics considered in this study namely catchment slope catchment size catchment length number of houses in catchment and housing density in catchment had a significant relationship with e coli riparian buffers were found to reduce faecal contamination in receiving waters regardless of weather regimes likely through the processes of exclusion of direct stock access from waterways and removal of e coli from overland flow pathways the higher of the percentage of catchment buffered and the ratio of buffer length to stream length the lower the observed concentration of e coli from the concentration discharge c q analysis it can be deduced that riparian buffers have a strong potential to affect the c q relationship which renders discharge insignificant in influencing the concentrations of e coli through interception and filtering and reducing the transport of e coli into the streams antecedent air temperature was also deemed to be influential to the concentrations of e coli from this study further investigations are warranted firstly extending upon our finding that the proportion of the catchment area covered by a buffer strip negatively correlates with in stream e coli concentrations it is worth assessing how the continuity and fragmentation of riparian buffers impact their performance in reducing e coli concentrations secondly since we found that riparian buffers can potentially disrupt the c q relationship further assessment via monitoring or modelling should be conducted to identify the detailed processes and transport pathways that are impacted by riparian buffers this will further inform the use of riparian buffers as a tool in combatting e coli and faecal pollution in waterways building catchment scale models may also assist in incorporating this knowledge on the impact of riparian buffers credit authorship contribution statement timothy j y lim

15675,high levels of e coli and associated faecal microbes in waterways as a result of agricultural and residential land use can pose environmental human health and economic risks this study aims to understand the impacts of land use climatic variables and riparian buffers on in stream e coli concentrations flow temperature and e coli were monitored during three sampling campaigns within eleven independent catchments these catchments have varying land use and extents of riparian buffer coverage results showed that catchments with predominantly agricultural and residential land uses average 349 7 mpn 100 ml had higher e coli concentrations than predominantly forested catchments average 111 8 mpn 100 ml however there were no statistically significant differences in e coli concentrations between the agricultural and residential land uses riparian buffers appear to reduce e coli concentrations in streams as indicated by significant negative correlations between in stream e coli concentrations with the riparian buffer areal coverage pearson s r 0 95 spearman s ρ 0 90 and the ratio of buffer length to stream length pearson s r 0 87 spearman s ρ 0 90 we find that riparian buffers potentially disrupt transport pathways that govern e coli movement which in turn can affect the concentration discharge relationship this reinforces the importance of protecting and restoring riparian buffers along drainage lines in agricultural and rural residential catchments to improve downstream microbial water quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords riparian buffers e coli rural land use spatio temporal variation 1 introduction poor water quality in rivers and lakes is a major issue worldwide obilonu et al 2013 having been associated with fish kills human illness loss of biodiversity and various socio economic problems specifically faecal pollution and associated microbial pathogens in rural catchments are problematic as they can increase the cost of water treatment and pose public health risks dearmont et al 1998 li and wu 2019 faecal pollution in waterways can have a number of sources in rural catchments for instance manure produced by stock or used in field applications in cropping areas can be washed into streams during wet weather hubbard et al 2004 waste effluents from wild animals both native and invasive and humans leaking septic tanks can also cause faecal pollution to aquatic systems the level of faecal pollution in waterways is often assessed using faecal indicator organisms fio because 1 their levels are high in sewage and faecal samples 2 are related to the presence of pathogens 3 are cheap and easy to measure and 4 have low pathogenic safety risk harwood et al 2014 mccarthy et al 2012 in relation to that escherichia coli e coli is one of the most commonly used fio due to the improved detection methods for e coli and e coli being able to provide a more faeces specific indicator than the other faecal coliforms griffith et al 2009 odonkor and ampofo 2013 total catchment land use may be a good predictor of e coli concentrations in streams this was suggested in the findings of nakhle et al 2021 which demonstrated a negative correlation between in stream e coli concentrations with the percentage of forested area due to high infiltration rates and contaminant trapping efficiencies and low levels of soil erosion conversely rural residential land has been associated with increased e coli concentrations e g mccarthy et al 2007 the association between rural residential land use and e coli concentrations can be due to the pollutants from anthropogenic sources including failing septic systems chen and chang 2014 rochelle newall et al 2016 in addition livestock grazing activities are frequently reported to increase nutrient and sediment export to streams in catchments dominated by agricultural activities e g blackburn 1984 schepers and francis 1982 wood and blackburn 1981 indirectly this can also lead to an increase in pathogen levels in waterways as bacteria are generally associated with these sediments davies and bavor 2000 phiri et al 2020 swaffer et al 2018 although the impact of different land uses on the concentrations of e coli have been well documented in rural catchments these studies were mainly focused on fixed frequency monitoring fixed frequency monitoring is a sampling regime which collects water samples at regular fixed intervals such as weekly or monthly intervals kerr et al 2018 this sampling method has been shown to have limitations particularly associated with the capture of wet weather events this can make subsequent analysis challenging as dry or wet weather water samples are difficult to distinguish in comparison to targeted event or campaign based sampling furthermore for fixed frequency monitoring changes in e coli levels may not be adequately captured during and between storm events mccarthy et al 2007 to help mitigate faecal pollution best management practices bmps have been used in rural catchments to reduce the impact of human activities riparian buffers also known as vegetative or grass filter strips are a commonly used bmp they can be described as vegetated zones adjacent to waterways to promote the growth of riparian buffers fencing of riparian areas is often used as a method to prevent stock access riparian buffers are capable of removing nutrients sediments and microbes from runoff baumhardt and blanco canqui 2014 jose et al 2012 thevathasan et al 2012 for example sunohara et al 2012 found that excluding stock with fencing and establishing a 5 10 m wide buffer strip at either side of a stream reduced the load of e coli coyne et al 1995 found that riparian buffers were able to remove up to 74 of faecal coliforms from runoff while tate pereira atwill 2004 showed that riparian buffers are able to achieve a mean log10 reduction of more than 1 for the total cryptosporidium parvum flux per metre of riparian buffer cardoso et al 2012 also demonstrated that riparian buffers are able to reduce bacterial e coli and salmonella runoff from swine manure slurry as compared to bare soil while these studies reported large reductions in concentrations and loads of bacteria through the use of riparian buffers most were conducted under controlled settings through the use of small plots soil boxes and simulated rainfall events rather than catchment scale studies that test the impact of best management practices in natural conditions brennan et al 2013 coyne et al 1995 korajkic et al 2014 additionally these studies did not investigate the effectiveness of riparian buffers under both dry and wet weather conditions and in different seasons previous studies have also demonstrated that the size of the riparian buffers can impact the level of stream water quality there are several studies that have investigated the impact of buffer width on the efficacy of bacteria removal however those studies neglected the impact of buffer length stanford et al 2020 for the studies which focused on the impact of buffer length none assessed the impact of buffer length on e coli concentrations and mostly focused on stream ecology physical and chemical parameters such as ph temperature dissolved oxygen conductivity and nutrients de oliveira et al 2016 hilary et al 2021 iñiguez armijos et al 2014 an understanding of the relationship between buffer sizes and e coli removal is essential for designing optimum sizes of riparian buffers to minimise faecal pollution risks particularly associated with agricultural run off escherichia coli concentrations vary temporally within catchments key factors affecting temporal e coli variability include presence of other microorganisms and biofilms exogenous survival ability variability of faecal deposition patterns from animals availability of water and nutrients temperature solar radiation and ph ferguson et al 2003 hansen et al 2020 jang et al 2017 specifically in rural streams hydrologic and climatological variables such as discharge as a result of rainfall and antecedent air temperature are often related to e coli concentrations many studies have shown that e coli concentrations generally increase with discharge during storm events hathaway et al 2015 kelsey et al 2004 this is due to the wash off process where e coli get mobilised and transported to the stream during rainfall antecedent air temperature can also result in variability in e coli concentration between rainfall events mccarthy et al 2007 in temperate regions the bacterium survives at lower temperatures and as temperatures increase e coli can become inactivated as a result of desiccation and solar radiation crane and moore 1986 ferguson et al 2003 vermeulen and hofstra 2014 whilst these drivers of temporal e coli variability are well studied the impacts of riparian buffers strips on these known relationships remain poorly understood with the introduction of riparian buffers e coli from overland flow can be filtered and retained during storm events which may potentially affect concentration discharge and concentration temperature relationships over time therefore the aim of this study is to understand the spatio temporal variability of e coli concentrations within mixed land use catchments with varying degrees of riparian buffer coverage specifically this study investigated relationships between the presence of varied degrees of riparian buffers in rural catchments and climatic and hydrologic variables specifically antecedent air temperature and discharge through the application of campaign based sampling the specific objectives were to determine 1 how land use in rural catchments is associated with e coli concentrations and how this relationship varies between dry and wet weather 2 how riparian buffers affect the concentration of e coli in streams whether the effect of riparian buffers on e coli concentrations in streams varies between dry and wet weather and 3 the effect of discharge and antecedent air temperature on e coli and whether this effect varies between different catchments based on their land use and riparian buffer coverage 2 methodology 2 1 catchment information and site characteristics the study catchment incorporating the tarago river system has an area of 11 400 ha and is located southeast of melbourne victoria australia the catchment was chosen as it has a variety of rural land uses such as forest residential areas and agricultural farmlands mostly dairy and beef cows the two main tributaries in the study catchment figure 1 are the west tarago river mt3 which makes up 63 of the catchment and consists mostly of state forest and the east tarago river catchment which consists of mixed land use such as horticultural and livestock farmlands and townships including neerim and nayook the tarago catchment has an annual rainfall of 953 mm melbourne water 2017 there were 11 monitoring sites established in 2016 within the catchment table 1 these covered the three main tributaries and eight other sites covering catchments with contrasting land use and cover of riparian buffers the land use s of the catchment of each monitoring site were classified using the victorian land use information system morse mcnabb et al 2015 and further verified using site surveys and satellite images sites with riparian buffers whether partially or fully buffered were identified using spatial datasets on revegetated areas from the local catchment management authority and further verified through visual inspection during fieldwork table 1 in addition the length and average width of the riparian buffers relative to the stream length for the small sub catchments were identified using spatial datasets from the local catchment management authority including shapefiles of riparian buffers and reaches of each catchment table 2 many of the riparian buffers were older than 10 years and were well established all riparian buffers in the site were planted using a mix of native species and were fenced to prevent stock access to the buffer zone and stream channel the overstorey included eucalyptus sp and larger acacias including melanoxylon and mearnsii mid stories consisted of native shrubs including but not limited to acacia solanum laciniatum prostanthera lasianthos leptospermum and cassinia while the understories were a mix of native and introduced ground cover species including but not limited to rubus parvifolius lolium perenne carex appressa lomandra longifolio juncus sp and paspalum distichum 2 2 data collection and preparation three water quality monitoring campaigns that each lasted 3 days were conducted between 2018 and 2019 table 3 at eight sites a sensor campbell scientific sdi 12 cs 451 measured water level and water temperature in the pool of a weir 90 v notch stainless steel weir plate 2 mm thick discharge was calculated using the standard equation for 900 v notch weirs standards australia 1991 water level calculated flow and temperature were recorded by a logger campbell scientific either cr300 or cr800 models at 1 minute intervals water level measurements were periodically checked against a manual measurement made using a staff gauge gauging stations were cleaned prior to each monitoring campaign to ensure that there were no blockages in the weir at the end of the collection period 1 minute data were aggregated into 6 minute intervals by averaging across the corresponding six time steps flow data at the sites of mt1 mt2 and mt3 were collected by melbourne water at recording intervals of 1 hour and downloaded from melbourne water s website where they are publicly available melbourne water 2021 a weather station within the catchment figure 1 measured temperature wind speed relative humidity solar radiation and rainfall depth at an interval of 6 minutes during each campaign 125 ml samples were collected in sterilised 1 l bottles at intervals of 15 minutes from each of the 11 sites until a volume of 1 l was reached therefore one 1 l bottle was filled every two hours using variants of sigma 900 autosamplers autosamplers were pre programmed for sampling to start at 8 am prior to the day of collection and to continue for 72 hours which resulted in a minimum of 36 bottles for each campaign for sampling campaign 1 sc1 did not have any flow while for sampling campaigns 1 2 and 3 sc8 did not have any flow as such only 10 monitoring sites were included in the data analysis in each campaign filled bottles were removed daily from the autosampler and transported on ice apart from campaign 1 where the bottles were transported at ambient temperature in insulated boxes within 4 hours of collection to the environmental public health microbiology laboratory ephm lab at monash university for e coli analysis concentrations of e coli were measured using the colilert method idexx laboratories 2013 as described by the manufacturer with either 5 dilution factor used 0 1 or 10 mpn 100 ml dilution factor used 0 05 as the limit of detection from this we obtained pollutographs of e coli across three days at each of the 10 sites for the 3 campaigns which consist of 322 e coli concentration data points from buffered sites 262 from unbuffered sites and 251 from the main tributaries 2 3 data analysis e coli concentrations were categorised into wet and dry weather data through a baseflow separation process using the lyne and hollick filter ladson et al 2013 an α filter parameter of 0 95 and 15 passes were adopted for baseflow separation for all the sites during the baseflow separation process a 30 buffer was applied due to the uncertainties of streamflow after considering the fact that most of the sites are small in area other than the three main tributaries the rest of the sites having an area of 63 ha and low in streamflow 0 074 mm h as such it was considered that if a streamflow value is lower than 1 3 times the baseflow value that particular value will be considered as dry weather flow ahyerre et al 1998 harmel et al 2016 mccarthy et al 2008 since the collected samples were composite samples collected over a 2 hour period a sample was classified as a dry or wet weather sample depending on the number of flow data points that were considered as wet within the 2 hour sample collection period for each 2 hour sample collection period main tributaries have two flow data points and others have 20 flow data points this is due to differences in the temporal resolution of flow data as flow data for main tributaries were collected in 1 hour intervals while flow data for other catchments were collected in 1 minute intervals and subsequently aggregated into 6 minute intervals a sample was classified as dry only if more than half of the flow points recorded in that sample s 2 hour collection period were classified as dry conversely whenever a dry sample was identified after a rainfall event i e samples transitioned from wet to dry weather sample in a baseflow separation curve all following samples were classified as dry only if it was entirely collected more than twice the time of concentration after the last recorded rainfall through looking at the data from tipping bucket rain gauge on site the time of concentration was estimated using equation 1 as proposed by mcdermott pilgrim 1982 due to its suitability for catchments under 250 km2 in victoria while the factor of two was used based on the conservative assumption that by this period surface runoff from previous rainfall would have all travelled to the outlet fang et al 2008 equation 1 t c h 0 76 a 0 38 where a is in km2 and tc is in hours subsequent data analyses were conducted through the use of several python libraries pandas v0 24 2 was used to create and manage the data frame numpy v1 16 4 was used in the concatenation of data scipy v1 2 1 was used for statistical analyses while matplotlib v3 1 0 and seaborn v0 9 0 were used for data visualisation purposes to investigate the effects of land use on e coli concentrations in streams boxplots of all e coli concentrations i e from all three campaigns from all 10 monitoring sites were constructed and the kruskal wallis k w test α 0 05 kruskal and wallis 1952 was used to determine whether there were statistically significant differences in e coli concentrations between sites dunn s post hoc tests were then used with α 0 05 dunn 1961 to check which sites were significantly different from each other these statistically significant differences were further analysed to see if they could be explained by the land use of each catchment subsequently the k w test α 0 05 kruskal and wallis 1952 was used to determine whether the relationship between land use and e coli concentrations differed between dry and wet weather events more detailed indicators of land use were explored in particular the number of houses and housing density in each catchment to assess the potential impact of human wastewater via septic tanks on e coli concentrations sowah et al 2014 in addition the relationships between e coli concentration and several unique natural catchment characteristics were investigated namely average catchment slope catchment area and catchment length which have been previously associated with spatial differences in water quality botter et al 2019 lintern et al 2018 phiri et al 2020 all of these parameters were analysed by plotting boxplots of e coli concentrations and using pearson s correlation i e pearson s r freedman et al 2007 and spearman s rank order correlation i e spearman s ρ spearman 2010 to identify if there were any trends between the above mentioned parameters and e coli concentrations median e coli concentrations at each site were used for pearson s correlation and spearman s rank order correlation analyses subsequently e coli concentrations measured in streams where the catchments contain buffers regardless of partial or fully buffered were first compared against those in catchments without buffers k w tests α 0 05 were then used to check if the differences in the e coli concentration were statistically significant the e coli concentrations were then categorised into measurements that were taken during dry weather events and those that were taken during wet weather events the impact of buffers on e coli concentrations under both dry weather and wet weather was also determined furthermore the relationship between the proportion of catchment buffered the ratio of buffer length to stream length and buffer width were explored against the median concentrations of e coli at each site overall median e coli concentrations of unbuffered sites were also included through the use of pearson s correlation freedman et al 2007 and spearman s rank order correlation spearman 2010 lastly to investigate the potential impacts of discharge and temperature on temporal change in e coli concentrations concentration discharge plots godsey et al 2009 rose et al 2018 of e coli for each site were constructed which combined data from all campaigns using data that were classified according to campaigns concentration discharge c q plots were first constructed for all monitoring sites with both axes log transformed then the relationship between e coli concentration and discharge was further investigated through identifying the log transformed linear regression slopes of c q plots musolff et al 2015 these slopes were used to understand whether the same temporal patterns are present for the catchments with similar catchment characteristics i e similar land use and presence absence of riparian buffers similar methods were also used to examine the relationship between e coli concentration and temperature by first constructing concentration temperature c t plots with both axes log transformed and then identifying the log transformed linear regression slopes of c t plots the temperature data used were 48 hours average antecedent air temperature climatic conditions recommended by mccarthy et al 2013 before the midpoint of sampling period 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli concentrations in dry and wet weather throughout all the sampling campaigns the concentrations of e coli ranged from 5 mpn 100 ml which is below the detection limit to 10 358 mpn 100 ml sc3 standard deviation 1325 2 mpn 100 ml table s1 the flow ranged from 0 00004 mm h sc3 to 0 074 mm h mt3 table s1 for 5 out of the 10 sites figure s1 sc1 sc2 sc5 mt1 and mt2 there was a significant difference k w test p 0 05 in e coli concentrations between dry and wet events the behaviour of these five sites aligned with findings from the studies of buckerfield et al 2019 islam et al 2017 and wu et al 2009 where wet weather e coli concentrations were generally higher than that of dry weather e coli concentrations however for the rest of the sites sc3 sc4 sc6 sc7 and mt3 we did not find a significant difference in e coli concentrations between dry and wet events this was not expected as similar studies conducted by buckerfield et al 2019 in catchments with a high proportion of agricultural land use had found that the wet weather e coli concentrations were one to three magnitudes higher than that of dry weather e coli concentration further analysis indicated that the lack of differences in e coli concentrations between dry and wet weather were not related to the amount of agricultural land use in the catchment figure 2 we hypothesise that there was no significant difference in e coli concentrations between dry and wet events due to the time of year when these campaigns occurred the wet weather samples were mainly taken in june whilst the dry weather samples were taken in october and december previous studies have shown that e coli concentrations in streams are not only affected by the magnitude of streamflow they can also be affected by the time of year of sampling due to the timing of agricultural practices and local management practices such as stock rotations and grazing timing wagner et al 2012 for example in our case as a result of high rainfall during the winter farmers may be less likely to graze steeper streamside paddocks due to accessibility issues which may hypothetically reduce faecal loadings at streamsides furthermore at different times of the year environmental factors such as temperature solar radiation hydraulic loading and antecedent soil moistures differ deletic and fletcher 2006 mccarthy et al 2011 šolić and krstulović 1992 there is also very likely to be substantial variability in local surface microclimates between sites due to differences such as vegetation coverage and effect resulting from the direction the catchment is facing e g in tarago catchment south facing slopes will be colder in general these factors are able to affect the inactivation and survival rates of e coli which can influence the levels and temporal variability of e coli 3 2 impacts of land use on e coli concentrations a comparison between the land use at each site and e coli concentrations demonstrated a statistically significant p 0 05 k w test result from dunn s post hoc analysis in table s2 difference between e coli in fully forested streams mt3 and the other catchments average 111 8 mpn 100 ml this was expected as previous studies have shown that forests remove e coli through promoting effective soil infiltration miyata et al 2009 in addition there is likely to be lower deposition of e coli in forested catchments due to the absence of agricultural activities as agricultural catchments are likely to have much higher faecal direct deposition rates due to condensed animal stocking as compared to forested catchments and human effluent sources septic tanks however in forested areas wild animals can be a potential source of e coli as previous studies have found that it is common to observe wild animals being a major contributor of faecal pollution in a forested catchment chandran and mazumder 2015 other than for forested catchments land use did not demonstrate an obvious relationship with measured e coli concentrations figure 2 in addition neither the number of houses in the catchment or the housing density were found to have a significant correlation with e coli figures s2 to s3 the lack of a relationship between land use and e coli concentrations was evident in both the overall concentrations and when data were separated between dry and wet weather events figure s1 furthermore there appeared to be no association between e coli concentrations and catchment characteristics such as slope size and length table s3 figures s4 to s6 we hypothesise that these findings are due to both agricultural and residential land uses containing a range of potential e coli sources for example in catchments with a high proportion of agricultural land use including livestock farming high e coli concentrations in streams can be expected e g murphy et al 2015 petersen et al 2018 rochelle newall et al 2016 in our case this is likely due to direct deposition or wash off of cow faecal matter furthermore disturbance of streams due to cattle further promotes mobilisation of sediments to which e coli can be adsorbed davies and bavor 2000 on the other hand for catchments with high residential land use which are also unsewered in this catchment septic tanks can act as sources of e coli to streams this is due to the fact that septic systems can act as a non point source of faecal pollutants sowah et al 2014 in addition previous studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between septic system density and pollution levels in streams mallin and mciver 2012 sowah et al 2014 importantly although it was known that agricultural rural residential and forested land uses are potential sources of e coli the use of modern source apportionment methods such as microbial source tracking through microbial communities e g henry et al 2016 mccarthy et al 2017 may better confirm the origins and contribution amount of faecal pollution in each catchment 3 3 performance and impacts of riparian buffers on e coli concentrations catchments with riparian buffers were found to have statistically significant lower e coli concentrations median 46 6 mpn 100 ml than unbuffered catchments median 255 1 mpn 100 ml figure 3 p 0 05 k w test similarly e coli concentrations within mt3 median 52 mpn 100 ml entirely forested catchment was found to be significantly p 0 05 k w test lower than that of mt1 median 126 1 mpn 100 ml mixed land use partially forested in combination these findings show that the presence of streamside vegetation in the form of riparian buffers from which stock have been excluded due to fencing of riparian areas is capable of reducing e coli concentrations in streams the results also showed that e coli concentrations were significantly lower in the buffered catchments dry median concentration 51 6 mpn 100 ml wet median concentration 41 6 mpn 100 ml than unbuffered catchments dry median concentration 255 1 mpn 100 ml wet median concentration 258 mpn 100 ml figure 3 irrespective of dry or wet weather conditions p 0 05 k w test several studies have reported that buffers are capable of removing microbes from runoff during wet weather events cardoso et al 2012 coyne et al 1995 tate et al 2004 and that fenced riparian buffers can reduce microbe exports during dry weather low flow conditions sunohara et al 2012 however mechanisms of removal are likely to be different during each condition for example during dry weather it is hypothesised that observed decreases in e coli concentrations are a result of the exclusion of livestock from the riparian zone miller et al 2010 wilcock et al 2013 during wet weather in addition to the removal of readily mobilizable faeces from the buffered area due to stock exclusion riparian buffers likely also function by passively filtering overland flow capturing slowing and removing e coli prior to transportation into local streams xue et al 2018 this hypothesis was supported by the data for wet weather events where it was observed that buffered strips had lower median e coli concentrations 41 6 mpn 100 ml than that of dry weather 51 6 mpn 100 ml figure 3 this finding contrasts to those studies done in agricultural dominant mixed land use settings which found that wet weather e coli concentrations were much higher than that of dry weather buckerfield et al 2019 islam et al 2017 therefore this supports a role for riparian buffers as a bmp that is highly efficient in mitigating faecal pollution in waterways importantly the e coli removal capacity of riparian buffers can also be improved through optimisation of size this was demonstrated through statistically significant negative correlations pearson s r 0 95 spearman s ρ 0 90 between the percentage of catchment area buffered and the concentrations of e coli figure 4 apart from that there is also a strong significant negative relationship pearson s r 0 87 spearman s ρ 0 90 between the ratio of buffer length to stream length and e coli concentrations table s3 these findings agree with those of hilary et al 2021 where the longer the length of buffer the greater the improvement of water quality there was no significant relationship between riparian buffer width and e coli concentrations table s3 however all the analysed buffered sites have already complied with the recommended minimum average riparian buffer width of roughly 15 m table 2 by hilary et al 2021 which found that narrow minimum of 15 m and long riparian buffers are most effective in protecting water quality our findings suggest that instead of just applying a standard minimum riparian buffer width it is also important to also consider the length of the riparian buffers these relationships while based on only median e coli concentrations of four buffered sites and overall median e coli concentrations of unbuffered sites suggests that there is a benefit in scaling the width and length of riparian buffers to the total catchment rather than applying a standard minimum amount of riparian buffers in order to maximise the water quality protection for receiving waters furthermore the relationships in table s3 can potentially be interpreted to construct a simple e coli regression model 3 4 impact of rainfall discharge and antecedent air temperature on e coli the concentration discharge c q relationship slopes table 4 for e coli concentrations were found to be statistically significantly positive p 0 05 for unbuffered sites sc2 sc3 sc4 and buffered site mt3 a positive c q slope signifies that flushing and transport via surface runoff is the dominant process controlling concentrations of e coli in the tarago catchment godsey et al 2009 most studies have shown that e coli concentrations generally increase during storm events and are correlated with rainfall intensity hathaway et al 2015 stea et al 2015 due to the e coli in the surface store that gets washed off and transported to receiving waters mccarthy et al 2011 the result table 4 suggests that riparian buffers may be the reason behind the non significance of the c q slopes from buffered catchments this may be due to the fact that riparian buffers disrupt the transport pathways that govern e coli movement which reduces the amount of e coli transported thereby interrupting relationships between discharge and e coli concentrations for buffered catchments in regard to the impact of antecedent air temperature on e coli concentrations there were 8 sites with significant c t relationship slopes p 0 05 figure s9 and table 4 among these 8 sites 5 of them had a positive c t slope while the other 3 had a negative c t slope based on the results our findings on the impact of antecedent air temperature on e coli concentrations were inconclusive we suspect that there is a combination of factors apart from antecedent air temperature e g vapour pressure nutrient levels relative humidity ph local soil microbiota management practices and surface microclimate that vary seasonally which affects the growth and inactivation of e coli hathaway et al 2010 and impact the c t relationship slopes the magnitude and significance of the log log c q and log log c t slopes did not vary with land use type table s4 and other considered variables catchment area slope housing density number of houses and catchment length the variability in these relationships could be due to varying numbers of wild animals and stock in each catchment during different time periods the soil type presence or absence of riparian buffers soil erosion dynamics and temporal patterns in stock rotations whilst this preliminary analysis suggests that the presence or absence of riparian buffers may be driving the significance of the c q slopes further monitoring and detailed modelling of the catchment are likely required to confirm this for c q slopes and identify the underlying factors of spatial variability in the c q and c t slopes 3 5 management implications of this study there are a number of important management implications from this study firstly regardless of residential or agricultural land use it seems that agricultural and rural residential development can potentially increase the concentrations of e coli in runoff secondly and most importantly riparian buffers are capable of reducing the concentrations of e coli in the non forested catchments during both wet and dry weather most likely through the physical direct stock exclusion and biological removal of e coli processes from overland flow pathways however reducing e coli concentrations also depends on the scale of riparian buffer implementation our monitoring and analyses suggest that it is not merely the presence or absence of riparian buffers but also the proportion of the catchment area that they occupy which can impact water quality particularly we found that increasing the proportion of the catchment area covered by riparian buffers and ratio of buffer length to stream length correlate to lower e coli concentrations in catchments with both agricultural land uses and rural residences while we have not explicitly connected these relationships to a specific formula we believe this information can potentially be used to construct a simple e coli regression model 4 conclusion agricultural and residential land uses were found to have higher e coli concentrations compared to forested areas this suggests that agricultural activities as well as the presence of rural residences can act as a major source of e coli in waterways none of the other catchment characteristics considered in this study namely catchment slope catchment size catchment length number of houses in catchment and housing density in catchment had a significant relationship with e coli riparian buffers were found to reduce faecal contamination in receiving waters regardless of weather regimes likely through the processes of exclusion of direct stock access from waterways and removal of e coli from overland flow pathways the higher of the percentage of catchment buffered and the ratio of buffer length to stream length the lower the observed concentration of e coli from the concentration discharge c q analysis it can be deduced that riparian buffers have a strong potential to affect the c q relationship which renders discharge insignificant in influencing the concentrations of e coli through interception and filtering and reducing the transport of e coli into the streams antecedent air temperature was also deemed to be influential to the concentrations of e coli from this study further investigations are warranted firstly extending upon our finding that the proportion of the catchment area covered by a buffer strip negatively correlates with in stream e coli concentrations it is worth assessing how the continuity and fragmentation of riparian buffers impact their performance in reducing e coli concentrations secondly since we found that riparian buffers can potentially disrupt the c q relationship further assessment via monitoring or modelling should be conducted to identify the detailed processes and transport pathways that are impacted by riparian buffers this will further inform the use of riparian buffers as a tool in combatting e coli and faecal pollution in waterways building catchment scale models may also assist in incorporating this knowledge on the impact of riparian buffers credit authorship contribution statement timothy j y lim

15676,pb in drinking water is one of the main sources of pb in human bodies besides excess lead incidents caused by lead service lines pb contamination in non lead pipe systems e g copper and pvc is also on the rise brass fixtures and lead solder connections are the primary sources of lead in non lead systems which cause intermittent peaks of pb at the consumer tap the concentrations of lead in tap water depend on pipeline geometry sampling methods and the characteristic of the pipe flow using a 3 dimensional computational fluid dynamics model this study analyzes the pb concentration variations at taps of copper water supply systems the turbulent diffusion and shear flow dispersion are fully simulated in the model to provide the most accurate prediction water parcels containing lead clouds are formed adjacent to lead sources during stagnation and are then dispersed with the flow of water through the pipe when the tap is opened the geometry of the pipeline has a significant impact on the monitored pb levels the complex flow condition in elbow areas leads to a more intense mixing of lead ions therefore the pb levels at consumer taps in complex plumbing systems in high rise buildings are higher than in straight pipelines when the sampling flow rate is large the peak height of pb is slightly higher due to higher turbulent intensity pb concentrations in sequential samples are predicted with sample volumes of 50 250 500 and 1000 m l lead levels may be diluted significantly when samples are taken in large volumes e g 500 m l or 1 l resulting in an underestimation of pb levels at taps a sample volume of 250 500 m l is recommended in sequential sampling programs on non lead service lines in order to identify pb sources keywords lead in drinking water lead solder brass fixtures sequential samples flow rate sample volume 1 introduction exposure to excess lead can result in cognitive and academic deficits in children and multi system damage in adults jusko et al 2008 lanphear et al 2000 lead in drinking water is one of the main sources of human lead exposure to reduce the lead level in drinking water increasingly stringent regulations have been introduced in recent decades currently the world health organization who provides a guideline value of 10 μ g l for lead in drinking water in the united states the lead and copper rule dictates that corrosion control actions must be performed if pb concentrations exceed the action level of 15 μ g l in more than 10 of samples collected from customer taps usepa 2013 recently canada and the european union proposed a more stringent limit of 5 μ g l for pb in drinking water european commission 2018 health canada 2019 there is no safe level of lead in drinking water and it is recommended to keep lead levels as low as reasonably possible for regulation sampling protocol design and decision making it is essential to understand lead concentration variations at consumer taps and factors that may affect monitored pb levels it is urgently necessary to develop accurate predictions of pb contamination under different water use conditions lead contamination in drinking water is most frequently investigated through on site sampling first draw sampling and random daytime rdt samplings are commonly used sampling protocols in regulatory monitoring programs the first draw sampling method takes the first 1l water stayed inside the plumbing system after a period of stagnation at lest 6 hours health canada 2019 usepa 2013 in random daytime sampling 1l samples are taken at a random time of a working day directly from the tap in a home without previous flushing department of the environment uk 1989 riblet et al 2019 the consumption habits i e the amount of water taken each time and the inter use time and the sampling sites influence the concentration of lead in a random manner chang et al 2021 this method provides an unbiased assessment of zonal pb exposure if enough large number of samples are collected nevertheless these sampling only provides partial information about a system and may miss the most seriously contaminated water in the system da luz and kumpel 2020 sequential sampling also known as profiling is often used for pb source identification and assessment of the corrosion control strategy this sampling method is performed by taking one liter samples consecutively after a period of stagnation at the consumer tap del toral et al 2013 doré et al 2018 lytle et al 2019 ng and lin 2016 thus it can provide a full picture of the pb contamination in the entire plumbing system the locations of lead service lines have been identified by comparing the volume of sampled water with the plumbing volumes lytle et al 2019 combing with the concentration of other metals such as cu and sn the type of pb sources can also be identified recently the pb exposure in large buildings are gaining increasing attentions cartier et al 2012 deshommes et al 2016 doré et al 2018 where non lead pipes are used for example in 2015 excess lead was found in the drinking water of public rental housing prh estates in hong kong the household sampling reveals that 47 2 of the first draw samples in the 11 affected estates have excess lead above the 10 μ g l however the employment of sequential sampling in non lead pipe water supply chains to identify lead sources is difficult first the lead sources in non lead service lines e g copper pipe systems are brass fixtures and leaded solder joints with lengths of 3 7 cm and less than 1 cm respectively they can be considered as point sources in the long systems typically 15 30 m pb condensed clouds released from these point sources will be significantly stretched by the dispersion effect of shear flow and mixing of turbulent pipe flow chan et al 2020 pb concentration peaks observed at consumer taps are low and intermittent which may be largely diluted to below the standard level in 1l samples therefore the lead contamination in the systems may be under estimated if 1l samples are collected sequential samples ranging from 30 m l to 125 m l were collected for testing the contribution of brass components and leaded solder joints hoekstra et al 2004 lytle et al 1996 but only a few samples were collected at specific locations it is very labor intensive and time consuming to collect all the plumbing volume of water with small volumes of samples e g 50 m l in addition the difficulty of on site sampling makes it unlikely to investigate the effect of pipeline geometry and sampling methods sampling volume flow rate etc on monitored pb levels the computational fluid dynamic cfd model provide a alternative approach to study the pb contamination and the appropriate sampling strategies on the basis of equlibrium concentration approach which assumed that pb ions are released from lead sources through molecular diffusion pb releasing process and transport have been simulated in lead service lines kuch and wagner 1983 van der leer et al 2002 based on single pipe model the effects of plumbosolvency lead pipe length and water using pattern on the zonal assessment of lead contamination are analyzed hayes 2009 nevertheless previous numerical models adopted the plug flow assumption under flowing conditions where effects of turbulent mixing and shear dispersion are ignored recently a model solving the dynamic 2 d convection diffusion equation in the axial and radial directions has been proposed by abokifa and biswas 2017 the geometry of the pipeline is neglected in 2d models with the increasingly stringent regulation rules of pb in drinking water it is required that the pb transport to be most accurately simulated the 3d computational fluid dynamic cfd model considering turbulent diffusion and shear flow dispersion can provide more detailed information and works as a supplementation of the limited field sampling data chan et al 2020 however the effects of the pipeline geometry sampling volume flow rate on the monitored pb concentration have not been investigated yet the objective of this study is to provide detailed information on pb releasing and transportation in drinking water supply systems using 3d cfd models first the theory of the numerical model is introduced and the detail of water supply systems is described after that the details of pb transportation and mixing during flow propagation are described and the predicted pb levels at consumer taps are presented under different water use conditions additionally this work investigated the effects of pipeline geometry and sampling method sampling flow rate sampling volume on monitored pb concentrations at consumer taps finally appropriate sampling volumes are suggested for copper pipe supply systems the method can be applied to a wide variety of water supply systems to provide valuable data for regulatory monitoring and decision making 2 materials and methods 2 1 real life water supply chains during the 2015 lead water episode of hong kong hk the prototype real life copper pipe water supply chains were dismantled from prh estates and reassembled at the electrical and mechanical workshop of water supplies department wsd of hk the plumbing components and pipeline geometry were kept the same with that before dismantlement these prototype water supply systems were made by copper pipe that connected by solder joints and brass fixtures to investigate the difference between pipelines with and without lead solder joints brand new water service lines consisting of only brass fixtures and copper pipes were constructed in the workshop by wsd one lead soldered supply chain rig 3c and one new service line without lead solder rig 4r are selected as test rigs in this study a detailed description of the drinking water supply pipelines and the experimental water qualities are available in the supplementary information si in test rig 3c the valves compression joints and water meter are brass components while the old solder joints were made from lead tin 60pb 40sn weld material rig 4r has four brass components and the pipeline geometry is relatively simple figure s1 the pipeline geometry of rig 3c is much more complex figure s2 with 5 lead solder connections and 7 brass fixtures the summary of the physical characteristics and plumbing components of the two test rigs are given in table 1 the metal composition of the typical brass fixtures used in these two test rigs are given in table 2 before dismantlement rig 3c has served for 11 years in prh buildings a layer of deposits formed on the inner surface of the entire pipeline which continuously releases low concentrations of lead into the surrounding water test rig 4r is new and no lead containing deposits are found on the pipe surface there are two major differences between the two types of water supply chains first the main sources of lead in the test rig 3c are the lead solder joints and brass fixtures however the brass fittings are the only type of lead source in the test rig 4r second besides the point sources of lead lead containing deposits on the inner surface of entire pipeline of test rig 3c can slowly leach low and evenly distributed background pb into the water body in test rig 4r pb can only be released from the brass fixtures sampling experiments were conducted in these pipelines to provide validation for the numerical model 2 2 numerical modeling of lead leaching and transport the pb releasing process can be simulated based on the equilibrium concentration approach chan et al 2020 van der leer et al 2002 the equilibrium concentrations e 0 of leaded components are calibrated against the measurement data of stagnant leaching experiments see details in chan et al 2020 in the stagnant leaching tests triplicate leaching experiments were carried out for each stagnation period and mean values used in the calibration of equilibrium concentration the calibrated equilibrium concentrations for the copper pipe with depositions brass fixture and leaded solder joints are given in table 3 due to the similar chemical composition of the brass fixtures used in test rigs 3c and 4r the e 0 value of 260 μ g l was used for all the brass components in this study the locations and lengths of the lead components were obtained from the plumbing survey in the numerical model the supply systems were discretized with unstructured grids grid sizes are smallest near lead components and gradually increase from the source to copper pipe sections in stagnant conditions the equilibrium concentration was described at the pipe surface wall of the leaded components in the numerical model since the locations and e 0 of the leaded components and the geometry of the pipelines are known the pb concentration distribution across the pipeline can be calculated from the model by solving the diffusion equation the pb concentration distribution after stagnation was used as the initial condition for the flow conditions under flowing conditions the boundary condition of the inlet was set to be mass flow boundary where the flow rate flow direction turbulent kinetic energy in m 2 s 2 and turbulent dissipation rate in m 2 s 3 were described the roughness height of the pipe wall was set to be 0 002mm düz 2017 the governing mass conservation equation in the water pipe flow can be written in terms of the lead concentration c x y z t and the 3d fluid velocity field u v w 1 c t u c x v c y w c z x e t d c x y e t d c y z e t d c z where d 9 36 10 10 m 2 s is the molecular diffusivity of pb sato et al 1996 e t 10 2 10 3 m 2 s is the turbulent diffusivity under flowing condition e t equals to zero under stagnant conditions and the equation reduces to the diffusion equation the turbulent mixing was determined from a two equation k ϵ turbulence model launder and spalding 1974 and the full 3d velocity field is computed zero flux condition c n 0 where n is the coordinate normal to pipe wall was applied at the wall of lead free pipe sections the cfd model calculated the pb concentration variation in the grid cells of the pipeline through time and space the pressure outlet boundary was applied to the outlet the tap of the computational domain and the flow rate and lead concentration were monitored at the outlet the flow rate and the cross sectional lead concentration goes across the outlet were outputted in each time step of the simulation the governing equations were solved by the cfd software ansys fluent ansys inc 2013 with a time step of 10 seconds in stagnant condition and 0 001s in flowing conditions the simulation scenarios are summarized in table 4 3 results 3 1 predicted lead concentration profiles at consumer taps at consumer taps outlets of the model pb levels were monitored with a time step of 0 005s which can be considered as instantaneous concentrations the pb concentration variations that have been measured in the test rigs 4r and 3c through field sampling experiments can be used as validation data of the numerical model in the sampling experiments the first one liter of water was collected in a 250 m l and a 750 m l sampling bottles and several 50 m l samples were taken at 20 second intervals afterward to compare with the measurement data the instantaneous pb concentration was averaged according to the volume of samples collected in the physical sampling tests to better illustrate the model measurement comparison the time variation of lead concentration c t at the tap can be transformed to a spatial variation of lead concentration c x as a function of traveling distance x from the standing point to the tap the transformation is carried out by using x u t where u is the cross sectional velocity and can be estimated from the flow rate q u π d 2 4 fig 1 and 2 compare the simulation results blue lines with the measurement data black dots a reasonable agreement is observed between simulation results and pb concentrations detected in samples with errors ranging from 0 to 17 5 the measured and predicted pb concentrations in samples are given in detail in si section 3 the cfd model predictions are somewhat encouraging considering the substantial variability in the measured lead leaching rates from the pipe and the leaded components the observed pb concentration peaks in the pipeline correspond to the location of the leaded components in test rig 4r with the identical equilibrium concentrations of the four components the shape of pb concentration profiles differ with the different traveling distance fig 1 peaks with smaller traveling distance show higher peak height and narrow width the highest instantaneous pb level of the fist peak can be as high as about 110 μ g l which decreases to below 10 μ g l for the last peak furthermore the two pb clouds released at the end of the pipeline merged into one during the transportation the effect of traveling distance and the combination of peaks are more obvious in test rig 3c fig 2 3 2 predicted pb level at taps of pipeline with different pipeline geometry numerical simulations were carried out in straight pipelines that have the same length and sources as real life water supply pipelines in order to evaluate the effect of the pipeline geometry on the monitored lead concentrations equilibrium concentrations and lengths of the leaded sources were set to the same values as in real pipes fig 1 compares the predicted pb concentration profiles at the outlets of the straight pipeline dashed lines with the actual water supply systems of test rig 4r solid lines pb concentration profile in straight pipelines shows lower and scattered peaks while those with elbows show higher and broader peaks the difference between hypothetical and real pipelines can be attributed to different transport and mixing characteristics with and without elbows the shear flow velocity profile see white arrows in fig 9a results in the separation of condensed pb clouds in long and straight pipelines for example the pb cloud released by the valve v at about 2 m from the tap was observed as two peaks at the tap additionally the pb clouds at the end of the pipeline released from m and v were spread out into a long tail with several lower peaks fig 2 shows the comparison between the predicted pb concentration variations at consumer tap of the simulated straight pipeline and the real test rig 3c with many small peaks the separation of pb concentration clouds is more apparent in simulated pipelines the difference is more noticeable as the distance increases considering the last group of pb clouds that were released at the end of the pipeline for example the peak height predicted at the tap of real rig 3c is several times higher than that at the tap of the straight pipe 3 3 predicted pb levels with different sampling flow rates in addition to the pipeline geometry the sampling flow rate can result in different pipe flow regimes and degrees of mixing of pb clouds using the same stagnation time the predicted pb concentrations at consumer taps were predicted under different flow conditions with 4 hours of stagnation fig 3 shows the captured pb levels at the tap 4r at sampling flow rates of 52 8 105 and 211 m l s there is a small difference between the three cases regarding the first two peaks that has been released from the two brass fixtures that are close to the consumer tap due to the short traveling distance the mixing effect of flow rate is not obvious however the predicted concentration distribution of pb clouds can be clearly seen after a traveling distance of about 10 m the resulting pb concentration profile is higher in peak height but with smaller peak width under large flow rates under the flow rate of 211 m l s the highest pb level can exceed 10 μ g l while it reduces to around 7 μ g l under the flow rate of 52 8 m l s this phenomenon can be observed more clearly in test rig 3c fig 4 the geometry of pipeline 3c is more complicated causing a noticeable difference for pb clouds with a traveling distance of 2 m under the flow rates of 211 m l s the predicted pb concentration peak can be as high as 39 μ g l while under the flow rates of 40 m l s the highest pb concentration is close to 30 μ g l 3 4 predicted pb levels in samples with different volumes water samples are usually collected in containers with specific volumes during field sampling experiments in lead pipe systems with lead service lines 1 l samples are often taken for monitoring pb levels however the determination of the appropriate sampling volume for copper pipe systems with leaded solder joints and brass fixtures is difficult with the help of the instantaneous concentration profiles from cfd models the average concentration in samples with different volumes can be calculated by averaging the instantaneous data within different time windows for example with a flow rate of 52 8 m l s the time needed to collect a sample of 250 m l is 4 73s in this study numerical samples with volumes of 50 m l 250 m l 500 m l and 1000 m l were collected the occupation length l in meter in the pipe of one sample the time it takes to collect one sample t in seconds and the number of samples needed n t to collect the whole plumbing volume are summarized in table 5 with the same stagnation time of 4h and flow rate of 52 8 m l s lead levels in samples with different sample volumes in test rig 4r are shown in fig 5 when sampling volume of 50 m l is used there are 3 samples containing excess pb over 10 μ g l which decreases to 0 when the sample volume is greater than 250 m l the maximum lead concentration in 50 m l samples is around 45 μ g l which drops to less than 6 μ g l in 1l samples similarly with 4h standing time and flow rate of 79 2 m l s the predicted pb levels in different volume of samples collected at the tap 3c are shown in fig 6 17 samples contain more than 10 μ g l in 250 m l water samples the number decreases to 8 and 2 when the sampling volume increases to 500 m l and 1 l the highest pb concentration in 50 m l samples is 75 μ g l which drops to 21 μ g l in one liter samples although the number of samples that exceed who guidelines falls rapidly with increasing sample volume samples of 500 and 1000 m l can still capture the water with high risk 4 discussion 4 1 lead releasing and transport in the plumbing system based on the equilibrium concentration theory lead is released from lead containing surfaces and diffused into the interior of the pipe during stagnation due to corrosion and galvanic corrosion chang et al 2022 van der leer et al 2002 the dissolved lead concentration gradually builds up and fills up the cross section with limited longitudinal spread there is no leaching of pb from the non leaded pipe surface after 4h stagnation pb concentrated clouds released from the four brass fixtures in the test rig 4r are shown in fig 7 cross sectional averaged pb level of pb condensed water parcels are about 110 μ g l the pb concentration distribution in test rig 3c is much more complex due to the three types of pb sources inside the pipeline the leaded deposits release a low and evenly distributed lead into the entire pipeline while the leaded solder and brass fixtures result in lead clouds with different concentrations with 4h stagnation the pb levels in copper pipe sections without leaded components are about 4 0 μ g l and the cross sectional averaged pb close to leaded solder joints and brass fixtures are about 380 and 110 μ g l respectively the pb concentration distribution in rig 3c after a stagnation of 4 hours are shown in fig 8 furthermore several lead sources are located close to each other inside test rig 3c resulting in groups of water parcels containing varying levels of lead when the tap is open the lead condensed water parcels are moved towards the consumer tap by turbulent pipe flow during the transportation the pb condensed water parcels mix with the ambient clean water as a result the peak concentration will be reduced with the increase of traveling distance the obtained pb levels at the consumer tap depends on the accumulated lead during the stagnation period and the mixing and transport in the system in most previous studies the pipe flow was assumed to be plug flow hayes 2009 which is unable to simulate shear flow dispersion and turbulent diffusion of the pipe flow in this study the effects of dispersion and diffusion are fully modeled and the results are reported in the following sections 4 2 pb transport and mixing in straight and bend pipe sections in straight pipe sections pb clouds are transported by shear flow velocity profiles see the white arrows in fig 9 at the center of the pipeline the flow velocity is larger and the cloud moves faster however the pb ions are more sluggish near the wall due to the slower velocity close to the boundary layer as a result the original pb condensed clouds will be broken down into several small lead rich water parcels during the transportation process the breaking down of pb clouds leads to lower and dispersed concentrations observed at the consumer tap of straight pipes in bends and elbows lead transport and mixing differ greatly from that in straight pipe sections on reaching the bend a tongue shaped cloud forms after traveling a short distance in the straight pipe fig 10 a flow across an elbow is characterized by radial pressure gradients caused by centrifugal forces as a result the outer side of the bend has a greater flow velocity than the inner side therefore the fluid at the center of the pipe moves towards the outer side before returning back along the wall towards the inner side pipe wall after the bend for instance fig 10 shows the velocity profile changes and pb concentration contours across a 90 degree bend in test rig 3c the velocity difference between the outer and inner sides increases right after the bend with the largest gradient occurring at the locations with the largest velocity difference because of the concentration and velocity gradient a relatively strong mixing occurs within a length of about 5 times the diameter of the pipe after the bend the streamline and turbulent kinetic energy tke in m 2 s 2 distributions through the 90 are shown in figures s3 and s4 the curved streamlines and large tke values inside the pipe section support the conclusion of intensive mixing in the region the pipeline geometries near the consumer tap or meter room are usually very complicated with many pb containing components installed in this short length of pipe section a group of pb clouds are released after stagnation a graphical representation of the concentration contours at the consumer tap of rig 3c after 4h stagnation period is shown in fig 11 when tap is opened the pb clouds are mixing during the propagation across the elbows fig 11 b c finally when the water was collected at the tap the four pb clouds merged into one pb rich peak with a peak height of as high as 35 μ g l second peak in fig 2 the turbulent kinetic energy tke in m 2 s 2 distribution in this pipe section is shown in figure s5 the stronger turbulent mixing in real life pipelines combined the pb clouds coming from multiple sources resulting in more concentrated concentration pb peaks at the taps pb is mixed differently in straight pipes and elbows illustrating the significance of pipeline geometries on pb transport in a pipeline chang et al 2021 by comparing predicted pb concentration profiles in straight and real pipelines the importance of using a 3 d cfd model that can fully simulate turbulent diffusion and shear flow dispersion can be clearly demonstrated pb levels at consumer taps cannot be accurately predicted by 1 d and 2 d models when water supplies are complex especially in high rise buildings with congested living environments 4 3 pb level at taps and residual in the system system flushing before water use for drinking is one of the most commonly recommended way to reduce the pb concentration in tap water however there is a large variation in the suggested flushing volume and time katner et al 2018 the system average pb concentration is built up during stagnation and reduced when pb ions are flushed out by pipe flow under flowing conditions after 4h of stagnation the system averaged pb level in test rig 4r is about 1 μ g l while that of rig 3c is 7 μ g l when the tap is opened the water that remained inside the pipeline is drained from the system and clear water containing negligible pb is pumped in accordingly the pb concentration in the pipeline decreases over time fig 12 shows the system averaged pb level black line as a function of tap opening time in test rig 4r the pb level in the system drops only when the pb concentration peaks blue dashed line reach the consumer tap however the situation is different in test rig 3c fig 13 due to flushing out of the pb ions that are released from the deposits all along the pipeline the averaged pb level continuously decreases with tap opening time sharp drops were observed when pb clouds released from leaded plumbing components were flushed out the average pb concentration in both systems was reduced to below 0 5 μ g l after the last pb peak was observed at the tap however the pb levels are not zero since pb ions are continuously released as the flow moves from the inlet to the outlet of the system with a flow rate of 79 2 ml s the water needs 126s to pass through the entire pipeline of test rig 3c during the course of about 2 minutes an average pb concentration of about 0 5 μ g l is achieved in the system this result shows that pb is released rapidly from pb sources and it is difficult to have a zero pb concentration in the system 4 4 appropriate sampling volumes in copper pipe water supply systems in different systems the appropriate sampling volume may differ depending on the pipe geometry and the pb sources the determination of the appropriate sampling volume for different types of plumbing systems can be done by field sampling experiments but it is labor intensive and costly del toral et al 2013 doré et al 2018 lytle et al 2019 ng and lin 2016 the prediction result of the 3d cfd model provides an alternative way to determine suitable sample sizes as shown in section 3 4 pb concentrations in samples decrease rapidly as the volume increases in water supply chains with brass components as the only kind of lead source e g rig 4r sampling works with sampling volumes larger than 500 m l may easily conclude that the pb level is below the who provisional guideline collecting numerous samples of 50 m l is costly and onerous britton et al 1981 a sampling volume of 250 m l can be used to avoid underestimation of pb levels and to reduce sampling labor and lead detection costs at the same time in systems with leaded solder and brass fixtures as the main lead sources e g test rig 3c 500 m l and 1 l samples are able to capture contaminated water with excess lead however a smaller sample volume of 250 m l can more accurately locate the pb source in both systems to be noted sampling volumes suggested above are based on water supply chains from hong kong households where brass fixtures and lead solder joints are the main sources the suitable volume can vary from system to system according to the strength and distribution of lead sources the pipeline length and geometry and other factors 5 conclusions a three dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd model has been developed in present work to investigate pb releasing and transport in drinking water supply systems the effect of pipeline geometry sampling flow rate and sample volume on monitored pb levels at consumer taps are examined small lead containing components installed in drinking water supply systems cause intermittent pb concentration peaks at the water tap during stagnation stage pb is released from leaded components and pb rich water parcels are formed when tap is turned on pb condensed water parcels are transported by pipe flow to the consumer tap the pipeline geometry has an important impact on lead transport pb clouds in straight pipe sections are typically broken down into small pb rich parcels by the shear flow while elbows can mix and combine pb condensed parcels as a result the complex geometry of water supply chains results in higher lead concentration peaks at the consumer tap than straight pipes containing the same lead sources therefore 1d and 2d model cannot fully simulate the real situation of pb transport in water supplies and 3d cfd model is needed the higher flow rate causes more turbulent flow in the pipe which results in higher pb peaks at the taps the appropriate sample volumes for lead contamination detection in copper pipe water supply chains with brass fixture and leaded solder joints as lead sources are proposed to avoid underestimating pb levels and to reduce sampling and testing costs at the same time samples ranging from 250 to 500 ml can be used in field sampling programs the results of this study provide insight into variations in pb levels in residential and commercial systems which can be helpful for drinking water quality regulations and decision making this work however makes conclusions based on specific water quality and plumbing systems with a majority of pb soluble in water in turbulent pipe flow pb particles may behave differently further consumers behavior is rather random in practice which could result in more complicated variations in pb concentrations at taps in order to reveal the true level of pb exposure in drinking water at a zonal level more factors as well as consumer behavior must be examined declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

15676,pb in drinking water is one of the main sources of pb in human bodies besides excess lead incidents caused by lead service lines pb contamination in non lead pipe systems e g copper and pvc is also on the rise brass fixtures and lead solder connections are the primary sources of lead in non lead systems which cause intermittent peaks of pb at the consumer tap the concentrations of lead in tap water depend on pipeline geometry sampling methods and the characteristic of the pipe flow using a 3 dimensional computational fluid dynamics model this study analyzes the pb concentration variations at taps of copper water supply systems the turbulent diffusion and shear flow dispersion are fully simulated in the model to provide the most accurate prediction water parcels containing lead clouds are formed adjacent to lead sources during stagnation and are then dispersed with the flow of water through the pipe when the tap is opened the geometry of the pipeline has a significant impact on the monitored pb levels the complex flow condition in elbow areas leads to a more intense mixing of lead ions therefore the pb levels at consumer taps in complex plumbing systems in high rise buildings are higher than in straight pipelines when the sampling flow rate is large the peak height of pb is slightly higher due to higher turbulent intensity pb concentrations in sequential

2008 lanphear et al 2000 lead in drinking water is one of the main sources of human lead exposure to reduce the lead level in drinking water increasingly stringent regulations have been introduced in recent decades currently the world health organization who provides a guideline value of 10 μ g l for lead in drinking water in the united states the lead and copper rule dictates that corrosion control actions must be performed if pb concentrations exceed the action level of 15 μ g l in more than 10 of samples collected from customer taps usepa 2013 recently canada and the european union proposed a more stringent limit of 5 μ g l for pb in drinking water european commission 2018 health canada 2019 there is no safe level of lead in drinking water and it is recommended to keep lead

samples are collected nevertheless these sampling only provides partial information about a system and may miss the most seriously contaminated water in the system da luz and kumpel 2020 sequential sampling also known as profiling is often used for pb source identification and assessment of the corrosion control strategy this sampling method is performed by taking one liter samples consecutively after a period of stagnation at the consumer tap del toral et al 2013 doré et al 2018 lytle et al 2019 ng and lin 2016 thus it can provide a full picture of the pb contamination in the entire plumbing system the locations of lead service lines have been identified by comparing the volume of sampled water with the plumbing volumes lytle et al 2019 combing with the concentration of other metals such as cu and sn the type of pb sources can also be identified recently the pb exposure in large buildings are gaining increasing attentions cartier et al 2012 deshommes et al 2016 doré et al 2018 where non lead pipes are used for example in 2015 excess lead was found in the drinking water of public rental housing prh estates in hong kong the household sampling reveals that 47 2 of the first draw samples in the 11 affected estates have excess lead above the 10 μ g l however the employment of sequential sampling in non lead pipe water supply chains to identify lead sources is difficult first the lead sources in non lead service lines e g copper pipe systems are brass fixtures and leaded solder joints with lengths of 3 7 cm and less than 1 cm respectively they can be considered as point sources in the long systems typically 15 30 m pb condensed clouds released from these point sources will be significantly stretched by the dispersion effect of shear flow and mixing of turbulent pipe flow chan et al 2020 pb concentration peaks observed at consumer taps are low and intermittent which may be largely diluted to below the standard level in 1l samples therefore the lead contamination in the systems may be under estimated if 1l samples are collected sequential samples ranging from 30 m l to 125 m l were collected for testing the contribution of brass components and leaded solder joints hoekstra et al 2004 lytle et al 1996 but only a few samples were collected at specific locations it is very labor intensive and time consuming to collect all the plumbing volume of water with small volumes of samples e g 50 m l in addition the difficulty of on site sampling makes it unlikely to investigate the effect of pipeline geometry and sampling methods sampling volume flow rate etc on monitored pb levels the computational fluid dynamic cfd model provide a alternative approach to study the pb contamination and the appropriate sampling strategies on the basis of equlibrium concentration approach which assumed that pb ions are released from lead sources through molecular diffusion pb releasing process and transport have been simulated in lead service lines kuch and wagner 1983 van der leer et al 2002 based on single pipe model the effects of plumbosolvency lead pipe length and water using pattern on the zonal assessment of lead contamination are analyzed hayes 2009 nevertheless previous numerical models adopted the plug flow assumption under flowing conditions where effects of turbulent mixing and shear dispersion are ignored recently a model solving the dynamic 2 d convection diffusion equation in the axial and radial directions has been proposed by abokifa and biswas 2017 the geometry of the pipeline is neglected in 2d models with the increasingly stringent regulation rules of pb in drinking water it is required that the pb transport to be most accurately simulated the 3d computational fluid dynamic cfd model considering turbulent diffusion and shear flow dispersion can provide more detailed information and works as a supplementation of the limited field sampling data chan et al 2020 however the effects of the pipeline geometry sampling volume flow rate on the monitored pb concentration have not been investigated yet the objective of this study is to provide detailed information on pb releasing and transportation in drinking water supply systems using 3d cfd models first the theory of the numerical model is introduced and the detail of water supply systems is described after that the details of pb transportation and mixing during flow propagation are described and the predicted pb levels at consumer taps are presented under different water use conditions additionally this work investigated the effects of pipeline geometry and sampling method sampling flow rate sampling volume on monitored pb concentrations at consumer taps finally appropriate sampling volumes are suggested for copper pipe supply systems the method can be applied to a wide variety of water supply systems to provide valuable data for regulatory monitoring and decision making 2 materials and methods 2 1 real life water supply chains during the 2015 lead water episode of hong kong hk the prototype real life copper pipe water supply chains were dismantled from prh estates and reassembled at the electrical and mechanical workshop of water supplies department wsd of hk the plumbing components and pipeline geometry were kept the same with that before dismantlement these prototype water supply systems were made by copper pipe that connected by solder joints and brass fixtures to investigate the difference between pipelines with and without lead solder joints brand new water service lines consisting of only brass fixtures and copper pipes were constructed in the workshop by wsd one lead soldered supply chain rig 3c and one new service line without lead solder rig 4r are selected as test rigs in this study a detailed description of the drinking water supply pipelines and the experimental water qualities are available in the supplementary information si in test rig 3c the valves compression joints and water meter are brass components while the old solder joints were made from lead tin 60pb 40sn weld material rig 4r has four brass components and the pipeline geometry is relatively simple figure s1 the pipeline geometry of rig 3c is much more complex figure s2 with 5 lead solder connections and 7 brass fixtures the summary of the physical characteristics and plumbing components of the two test rigs are given in table 1 the metal composition of the typical brass fixtures used in these two test rigs are given in table 2 before dismantlement rig 3c has served for 11 years in prh buildings a layer of deposits formed on the inner surface of the entire pipeline which continuously releases low concentrations of lead into the surrounding water test rig 4r is new and no lead containing deposits are found on the pipe surface there are two major differences between the two types of water supply chains first the main sources of lead in the test rig 3c are the lead solder joints and brass fixtures however the brass fittings are the only type of lead source in the test rig 4r second besides the point sources of lead lead containing deposits on the inner surface of entire pipeline of test rig 3c can slowly leach low and evenly distributed background pb into the water body in test rig 4r pb can only be released from the brass fixtures sampling experiments were conducted in these pipelines to provide validation for the numerical model 2 2 numerical modeling of lead leaching and transport the pb releasing process can be simulated based on the equilibrium concentration approach chan et al 2020 van der leer et al 2002 the equilibrium concentrations e 0 of leaded components are calibrated against the measurement data of stagnant leaching experiments see details in chan et al 2020 in the stagnant leaching tests triplicate leaching experiments were carried out for each stagnation period and mean values used in the calibration of equilibrium concentration the calibrated equilibrium concentrations for the copper pipe with depositions brass fixture and leaded solder joints are given in table 3 due to the similar chemical composition of the brass fixtures used in test rigs 3c and 4r the e 0 value of 260 μ g l was used for all the brass components in this study the locations and lengths of the lead components were obtained from the plumbing survey in the numerical model the supply systems were discretized with unstructured grids grid sizes are smallest near lead components and gradually increase from the source to copper pipe sections in stagnant conditions the equilibrium concentration was described at the pipe surface wall of the leaded components in the numerical model since the locations and e 0 of the leaded components and the geometry of the pipelines are known the pb concentration distribution across the pipeline can be calculated from the model by solving the diffusion equation the pb concentration distribution after stagnation was used as the initial condition for the flow conditions under flowing conditions the boundary condition of the inlet was set to be mass flow boundary where the flow rate flow direction turbulent kinetic energy in m 2 s 2 and turbulent dissipation rate in m 2 s 3 were described the roughness height of the pipe wall was set to be 0 002mm düz 2017 the governing mass conservation equation in the water pipe flow can be written in terms of the lead concentration c x y z t and the 3d fluid velocity field u v w 1 c t u c x v c y w c z x e t d c x y e t d c y z e t d c z where d 9 36 10 10 m 2 s is the molecular diffusivity of pb sato et al 1996 e t 10 2 10 3 m 2 s is the turbulent diffusivity under flowing condition e t equals to zero under stagnant conditions and the equation reduces to the diffusion equation the turbulent mixing was determined from a two equation k ϵ turbulence model launder and spalding 1974 and the full 3d velocity field is computed zero flux condition c n 0 where n is the coordinate normal to pipe wall was applied at the wall of lead free pipe sections the cfd model calculated the pb concentration variation in the grid cells of the pipeline through time and space the pressure outlet boundary was applied to the outlet the tap of the computational domain and the flow rate and lead concentration were monitored at the outlet the flow rate and the cross sectional lead concentration goes across the outlet were outputted in each time step of the simulation the governing equations were solved by the cfd software ansys fluent ansys inc 2013 with a time step of 10 seconds in stagnant condition and 0 001s in flowing conditions the simulation scenarios are summarized in table 4 3 results 3 1 predicted lead concentration profiles at consumer taps at consumer taps outlets of the model pb levels were monitored with a time step of 0 005s which can be considered as instantaneous concentrations the pb concentration variations that have been measured in the test rigs 4r and 3c through field sampling experiments can be used as validation data of the numerical model in the sampling experiments the first one liter of water was collected in a 250 m l and a 750 m l sampling bottles and several 50 m l samples were taken at 20 second intervals afterward to compare with the measurement data the instantaneous pb concentration was averaged according to the volume of samples collected in the physical sampling tests to better illustrate the model measurement comparison the time variation of lead concentration c t at the tap can be transformed to a spatial variation of lead concentration c x as a function of traveling distance x from the standing point to the tap the transformation is carried out by using x u t where u is the cross sectional velocity and can be estimated from the flow rate q u π d 2 4 fig 1 and 2 compare the simulation results blue lines with the measurement data black dots a reasonable agreement is observed between simulation results and pb concentrations detected in samples with errors ranging from 0 to 17 5 the measured and predicted pb concentrations in samples are given in detail in si section 3 the cfd model predictions are somewhat encouraging considering the substantial variability in the measured lead leaching rates from the pipe and the leaded components the observed pb concentration peaks in the pipeline correspond to the location of the leaded components in test rig 4r with the identical equilibrium concentrations of the four components the shape of pb concentration profiles differ with the different traveling distance fig 1 peaks with smaller traveling distance show higher peak height and narrow width the highest instantaneous pb level of the fist peak can be as high as about 110 μ g l which decreases to below 10 μ g l for the last peak furthermore the two pb clouds released at the end of the pipeline merged into one during the transportation the effect of traveling distance and the combination of peaks are more obvious in test rig 3c fig 2 3 2 predicted pb level at taps of pipeline with different pipeline geometry numerical simulations were carried out in straight pipelines that have the same length and sources as real life water supply pipelines in order to evaluate the effect of the pipeline geometry on the monitored lead concentrations equilibrium concentrations and lengths of the leaded sources were set to the same values as in real pipes fig 1 compares the predicted pb concentration profiles at the outlets of the straight pipeline dashed lines with the actual water supply systems of test rig 4r solid lines pb concentration profile in straight pipelines shows lower and scattered peaks while those with elbows show higher and broader peaks the difference between hypothetical and real pipelines can be attributed to different transport and mixing characteristics with and without elbows the shear flow velocity profile see white arrows in fig 9a results in the separation of condensed pb clouds in long and straight pipelines for example the pb cloud released by the valve v at about 2 m from the tap was observed as two peaks at the tap additionally the pb clouds at the end of the pipeline released from m and v were spread out into a long tail with several lower peaks fig 2 shows the comparison between the predicted pb concentration variations at consumer tap of the simulated straight pipeline and the real test rig 3c with many small peaks the separation of pb concentration clouds is more apparent in simulated pipelines the difference is more noticeable as the distance increases considering the last group of pb clouds that were released at the end of the pipeline for example the peak height predicted at the tap of real rig 3c is several times higher than that at the tap of the straight pipe 3 3 predicted pb levels with different sampling flow rates in addition to the pipeline geometry the sampling flow rate can result in different pipe flow regimes and degrees of mixing of pb clouds using the same stagnation time the predicted pb concentrations at consumer taps were predicted under different flow conditions with 4 hours of stagnation fig 3 shows the captured pb levels at the tap 4r at sampling flow rates of 52 8 105 and 211 m l s there is a small difference between the three cases regarding the first two peaks that has been released from the two brass fixtures that are close to the consumer tap due to the short traveling distance the mixing effect of flow rate is not obvious however the predicted concentration distribution of pb clouds can be clearly seen after a traveling distance of about 10 m the resulting pb concentration profile is higher in peak height but with smaller peak width under large flow rates under the flow rate of 211 m l s the highest pb level can exceed 10 μ g l while it reduces to around 7 μ g l under the flow rate of 52 8 m l s this phenomenon can be observed more clearly in test rig 3c fig 4 the geometry of pipeline 3c is more complicated causing a noticeable difference for pb clouds with a traveling distance of 2 m under the flow rates of 211 m l s the predicted pb concentration peak can be as high as 39 μ g l while under the flow rates of 40 m l s the highest pb concentration is close to 30 μ g l 3 4 predicted pb levels in samples with different volumes water samples are usually collected in containers with specific volumes during field sampling experiments in lead pipe systems with lead service lines 1 l samples are often taken for monitoring pb levels however the determination of the appropriate sampling volume for copper pipe systems with leaded solder joints and brass fixtures is difficult with the help of the instantaneous concentration profiles from cfd models the average concentration in samples with different volumes can be calculated by averaging the instantaneous data within different time windows for example with a flow rate of 52 8 m l s the time needed to collect a sample of 250 m l is 4 73s in this study numerical samples with volumes of 50 m l 250 m l 500 m l and 1000 m l were collected the occupation length l in meter in the pipe of one sample the time it takes to collect one sample t in seconds and the number of samples needed n t to collect the whole plumbing volume are summarized in table 5 with the same stagnation time of 4h and flow rate of 52 8 m l s lead levels in samples with different sample volumes in test rig 4r are shown in fig 5 when sampling volume of 50 m l is used there are 3 samples containing excess pb over 10 μ g l which decreases to 0 when the sample volume is greater than 250 m l the maximum lead concentration in 50 m l samples is around 45 μ g l which drops to less than 6 μ g l in 1l samples similarly with 4h standing time and flow rate of 79 2 m l s the predicted pb levels in different volume of samples collected at the tap 3c are shown in fig 6 17 samples contain more than 10 μ g l in 250 m l water samples the number decreases to 8 and 2 when the sampling volume increases to 500 m l and 1 l the highest pb concentration in 50 m l samples is 75 μ g l which drops to 21 μ g l in one liter samples although the number of samples that exceed who guidelines falls rapidly with increasing sample volume samples of 500 and 1000 m l can still capture the water with high risk 4 discussion 4 1 lead releasing and transport in the plumbing system based on the equilibrium concentration theory lead is released from lead containing surfaces and diffused into the interior of the pipe during stagnation due to corrosion and galvanic corrosion chang et al 2022 van der leer et al 2002 the dissolved lead concentration gradually builds up and fills up the cross section with limited longitudinal spread there is no leaching of pb from the non leaded pipe surface after 4h stagnation pb concentrated clouds released from the four brass fixtures in the test rig 4r are shown in fig 7 cross sectional averaged pb level of pb condensed water parcels are about 110 μ g l the pb concentration distribution in test rig 3c is much more complex due to the three types of pb sources inside the pipeline the leaded deposits release a low and evenly distributed lead into the entire pipeline while the leaded solder and brass fixtures result in lead clouds with different concentrations with 4h stagnation the pb levels in copper pipe sections without leaded components are about 4 0 μ g l and the cross sectional averaged pb close to leaded solder joints and brass fixtures are about 380 and 110 μ g l respectively the pb concentration distribution in rig 3c after a stagnation of 4 hours are shown in fig 8 furthermore several lead sources are located close to each other inside test rig 3c resulting in groups of water parcels containing varying levels of lead when the tap is open the lead condensed water parcels are moved towards the consumer tap by turbulent pipe flow during the transportation the pb condensed water parcels mix with the ambient clean water as a result the peak concentration will be reduced with the increase of traveling distance the obtained pb levels at the consumer tap depends on the accumulated lead during the stagnation period and the mixing and transport in the system in most previous studies the pipe flow was assumed to be plug flow hayes 2009 which is unable to simulate shear flow dispersion and turbulent diffusion of the pipe flow in this study the effects of dispersion and diffusion are fully modeled and the results are reported in the following sections 4 2 pb transport and mixing in straight and bend pipe sections in straight pipe sections pb clouds are transported by shear flow velocity profiles see the white arrows in fig 9 at the center of the pipeline the flow velocity is larger and the cloud moves faster however the pb ions are more sluggish near the wall due to the slower velocity close to the boundary layer as a result the original pb condensed clouds will be broken down into several small lead rich water parcels during the transportation process the breaking down of pb clouds leads to lower and dispersed concentrations observed at the consumer tap of straight pipes in bends and elbows lead transport and mixing differ greatly from that in straight pipe sections on reaching the bend a tongue shaped cloud forms after traveling a short distance in the straight pipe fig 10 a flow across an elbow is characterized by radial pressure gradients caused by centrifugal forces as a result the outer side of the bend has a greater flow velocity than the inner side therefore the fluid at the center of the pipe moves towards the outer side before returning back along the wall towards the inner side pipe wall after the bend for instance fig 10 shows the velocity profile changes and pb concentration contours across a 90 degree bend in test rig 3c the velocity difference between the outer and inner sides increases right after the bend with the largest gradient occurring at the locations with the largest velocity difference because of the concentration and velocity gradient a relatively strong mixing occurs within a length of about 5 times the diameter of the pipe after the bend the streamline and turbulent kinetic energy tke in m 2 s 2 distributions through the 90 are shown in figures s3 and s4 the curved streamlines and large tke values inside the pipe section support the conclusion of intensive mixing in the region the pipeline geometries near the consumer tap or meter room are usually very complicated with many pb containing components installed in this short length of pipe section a group of pb clouds are released after stagnation a graphical representation of the concentration contours at the consumer tap of rig 3c after 4h stagnation period is shown in fig 11 when tap is opened the pb clouds are mixing during the propagation across the elbows fig 11 b c finally when the water was collected at the tap the four pb clouds merged into one pb rich peak with a peak height of as high as 35 μ g l second peak in fig 2 the turbulent kinetic energy tke in m 2 s 2 distribution in this pipe section is shown in figure s5 the stronger turbulent mixing in real life pipelines combined the pb clouds coming from multiple sources resulting in more concentrated concentration pb peaks at the taps pb is mixed differently in straight pipes and elbows illustrating the significance of pipeline geometries on pb transport in a pipeline chang et al 2021 by comparing predicted pb concentration profiles in straight and real pipelines the importance of using a 3 d cfd model that can fully simulate turbulent diffusion and shear flow dispersion can be clearly demonstrated pb levels at consumer taps cannot be accurately predicted by 1 d and 2 d models when water supplies are complex especially in high rise buildings with congested living environments 4 3 pb level at taps and residual in the system system flushing before water use for drinking is one of the most commonly recommended way to reduce the pb concentration in tap water however there is a large variation in the suggested flushing volume and time katner et al 2018 the system average pb concentration is built up during stagnation and reduced when pb ions are flushed out by pipe flow under flowing conditions after 4h of stagnation the system averaged pb level in test rig 4r is about 1 μ g l while that of rig 3c is 7 μ g l when the tap is opened the water that remained inside the pipeline is drained from the system and clear water containing negligible pb is pumped in accordingly the pb concentration in the pipeline decreases over time fig 12 shows the system averaged pb level black line as a function of tap opening time in test rig 4r the pb level in the system drops only when the pb concentration peaks blue dashed line reach the consumer tap however the situation is different in test rig 3c fig 13 due to flushing out of the pb ions that are released from the deposits all along the pipeline the averaged pb level continuously decreases with tap opening time sharp drops were observed when pb clouds released from leaded plumbing components were flushed out the average pb concentration in both systems was reduced to below 0 5 μ g l after the last pb peak was observed at the tap however the pb levels are not zero since pb ions are continuously released as the flow moves from the inlet to the outlet of the system with a flow rate of 79 2 ml s the water needs 126s to pass through the entire pipeline of test rig 3c during the course of about 2 minutes an average pb concentration of about 0 5 μ g l is achieved in the system this result shows that pb is released rapidly from pb sources and it is difficult to have a zero pb concentration in the system 4 4 appropriate sampling volumes in copper pipe water supply systems in different systems the appropriate sampling volume may differ depending on the pipe geometry and the pb sources the determination of the appropriate sampling volume for different types of plumbing systems can be done by field sampling experiments but it is labor intensive and costly del toral et al 2013 doré et al 2018 lytle et al 2019 ng and lin 2016 the prediction result of the 3d cfd model provides an alternative way to determine suitable sample sizes as shown in section 3 4 pb concentrations in samples decrease rapidly as the volume increases in water supply chains with brass components as the only kind of lead source e g rig 4r sampling works with sampling volumes larger than 500 m l may easily conclude that the pb level is below the who provisional guideline collecting numerous samples of 50 m l is costly and onerous britton et al 1981 a sampling volume of 250 m l can be used to avoid underestimation of pb levels and to reduce sampling labor and lead detection costs at the same time in systems with leaded solder and brass fixtures as the main lead sources e g test rig 3c 500 m l and 1 l samples are able to capture contaminated water with excess lead however a smaller sample volume of 250 m l can more accurately locate the pb source in both systems to be noted sampling volumes suggested above are based on water supply chains from hong kong households where brass fixtures and lead solder joints are the main sources the suitable volume can vary from system to system according to the strength and distribution of lead sources the pipeline length and geometry and other factors 5 conclusions a three dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd model has been developed in present work to investigate pb releasing and transport in drinking water supply systems the effect of pipeline geometry sampling flow rate and sample volume on monitored pb levels at consumer taps are examined small lead containing components installed in drinking water supply systems cause intermittent pb concentration peaks at the water tap during stagnation stage pb is released from leaded components and pb rich water parcels are formed when tap is turned on pb condensed water parcels are transported by pipe flow to the consumer tap the pipeline geometry has an important impact on lead transport pb clouds in straight pipe sections are typically broken down into small pb rich parcels by the shear flow while elbows can mix and combine pb condensed parcels as a result the complex geometry of water supply chains results in higher lead concentration peaks at the consumer tap than straight pipes containing the same lead sources therefore 1d and 2d model cannot fully simulate the real situation of pb transport in water supplies and 3d cfd model is needed the higher flow rate causes more turbulent flow in the pipe which results in higher pb peaks at the taps the appropriate sample volumes for lead contamination detection in copper pipe water supply chains with brass fixture and leaded solder joints as lead sources are proposed to avoid underestimating pb levels and to reduce sampling and testing costs at the same time samples ranging from 250 to 500 ml can be used in field sampling programs the results of this study provide insight into variations in pb levels in residential and commercial systems which can be helpful for drinking water quality regulations and decision making this work however makes conclusions based on specific water quality and plumbing systems with a majority of pb soluble in water in turbulent pipe flow pb particles may behave differently further consumers behavior is rather random in practice which could result in more complicated variations in pb concentrations at taps in order to reveal the true level of pb exposure in drinking water at a zonal level more factors as well as consumer behavior must be examined declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

15677,in marine investigations the maximum chlorophyll a chla concentration is often reported to occur at a specific depth below the ocean surface a phenomenon known as subsurface chla maxima scm however scm has long been overlooked in artificial reservoirs which may lead to a serious underestimation of the primary productivity level and trophic status of reservoirs to better understand the temporal and spatial variability of scm and the mechanisms leading to scm development this study conducted a detailed survey in a large subtropical reservoir xinanjiang reservoir xajr from september 2020 to august 2021 the seasonal thermal stratification in situ variables wt ph do and chla nutrient concentrations dsi no3 dip and dco2 chla maxima depth and magnitude of the riverine region s1 transition region s2 and the central part of the xajr s3 and s4 were all thoroughly investigated thermal stratification and scm in xajr exhibited significant seasonal and spatial heterogeneity phytoplankton biomass in the epilimnion was limited by dissolved co2 from june to october in the warm seasons while it was primarily limited by phosphorus in the other seasons according to the nutrient limitation analysis along the water column dissolved co2 limitation occurred mainly above the scm layer and the water column below the scm layer gradually transitioned from dissolved co2 limitation to phosphorus limitation furthermore as the thermal stratification developed the upstream water mass moves along the middle of the water column as density flow toward the reservoir providing nutrients for the development of the scm this research contributes to a better understanding of the temporal and spatial variation of scm and nutrient supply in deep and large stratified reservoirs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords subsurface chlorophyll a maxima seasonal thermal stratification dissolved co2 limitation large subtropical reservoir data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the phenomenon of subsurface chlorophyll a chla concentration maxima scm refers to the occurrence of maximum chla concentration at a specific depth below the water surface a phenomenon that was firstly observed during oceanic surveys cordeiro et al 2013 cullen 1982 the phytoplankton biomass accumulates and grows abundantly in a specific depth range usually a few centimeters to several meters due to the interaction of light nutrient gradients and thermal stratification resulting in the formation of a thin plankton layer durham and stocker 2012 also known as the maximum chla layer located in the subsurface or deep layer the scm layer contributes significantly to the primary productivity of the water column for example in the arctic ocean the scm layer accounts for 65 90 of the total primary productivity of the water column martin et al 2010 2013 recently similar phenomena have been occasionally reported in inland waters such as natural lakes and artificial reservoirs reinl et al 2020 giling et al 2017 leach et al 2018 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd defines a lake as eutrophic when the chla concentration exceeds 8 μg l oecd 1982 in the xinanjiang reservoir in china the maximum value of scm layer was sometimes 7 8 times higher than chla at the surface reaching about 30 μg l and the maximum depth of scm was about 5 m underwater liu et al 2020 however this underwater algal bloom layer consisting of a thin layer with high chla concentration is often ignored in current lake and reservoir water quality assessment and water sampling strategies e g gb3838 2002 chinese water quality standards furthermore the obvious difference in trophic status between the epilimnion layer and the scm layer suggests that there are deficiencies in the assessment of trophic status in deep and large reservoirs as a result the research on the mechanisms of the development of the scm phenomenon particularly in deep and large reservoirs as a source of urban drinking water is beneficial to improve the method of inland water quality evaluation neglecting scm may expose the safety of urban drinking water to potential hazards such as water quality deterioration caused by algal toxins and their derivatives produced by algal growth and metabolism hudnell 2009 many factors influence the magnitude and depth of the scm with effective light radiation levels vertical distribution of nutrients and thermal stratification of the water column being the most important abiotic factors abbott et al 1984 cullen 2015 valenti et al 2015 the main biological factors are considered to be phytoplankton growth rates microbial food webs and zooplankton grazing camacho 2006 sommer et al 2012 lofton et al 2020 during the thermal stratification season the vertical distribution of nutrients along the water column is usually uneven leading to changes in the magnitude and depth of the scm layers cleeg et al 2007 descy et al 2010 in addition horizontal movement of water masses such as those intruding from upstream rivers may influence scm formation by continuously transporting nutrients to specific depths durham and stocker 2012 currently few studies on scm in inland waters have been conducted mainly focusing on a few large natural lakes reinl et al 2020 hamilton et al 2010 leach et al 2018 beisher and longhi 2013 brentrup et al 2016 recently liu liu et al 2020 reported the spatial distribution of scm in spring and summer of a large artificial reservoir but its seasonal development process and the mechanisms leading to the development of scm are rarely documented studying the mechanisms of scm formation in large reservoirs is critical for the assessment of the hot spot of primary productivity leach et al 2018 and trophic status of water bodies artificial reservoirs are obviously different from marine and natural lakes in terms of retention time storage cycle drainage mode and hydrological regulating capacity furthermore most reservoirs have subsurface currents that influence water temperature dissolved oxygen gradients and nutrient retention times all of which can influence the formation of scm in addition previous studies have highlighted the effects of changes in nutrient concentration in the water column on scm development beckmann and hense 2007 liu et al 2020 but studies on the effects of nutrient stoichiometry are lacking freshwater ecosystem studies have found that the redfield ratio is higher in lakes than in oceans reaching c n p 166 20 1 redfield 1958 sterner et al 2008 in general the amount of phytoplankton biomass in lakes is believed to be limited mainly by n or p due to the high concentration of dic in lakes and reservoirs the limiting role of dic has long been overlooked in nutrient limitation analyses in fact photosynthesis in freshwater phytoplankton preferentially absorbs dissolved co2 from the water rather than hco3 or co3 2 meyer and griffiths 2013 this process leads to depletion of dissolved co2 in water especially in the upper layers of water with strong photosynthesis thus despite high dic concentrations in the water dissolved co2 required by algae for photosynthesis may be lacking which can potentially limit algae growth zagarese et al 2021 for this reason dissolved co2 was included in the nutrient limitation analysis of this study in this study a large reservoir in the qiantang river basin of eastern china xinanjiang reservoir xajr was selected for a detailed investigation of the formation and environmental driving factors of scm this reservoir is the largest artificial freshwater lake in china and an important water source in the yangtze river delta region of china with large storage capacity and strong regulating capacity the main objectives of this study include 1 to reveal the vertical and horizontal seasonal changes of scm 2 to examine the effects of water mass movement patterns on nutrient supply in different seasons 3 to study the seasonal and vertical limitations of phosphorus and dissolved co2 on algae growth 2 study area and methodology 2 1 study area and

the river to the xajr dam except for february 2021 which was not sampled due to covid 19 fig 1 four to six layers of water were collected at each sampling site depending on the water depth with sampling intervals of 0 m 5 m 10 m 15 m 30 m and 50 m in addition the water column from 0 to 10 m was sampled at 1 m intervals from march to august when thermal stratification began temperature t chla

stratification index s δ t t a v e r a g e was used to assess the stability of the stratified structure wang 2020 the thermal stratification index can be calculated by the following equation 1 s δ t t a v e r a g e where δ t is the temperature difference between surface water and bottom water t a v e r a g e is the average temperature of the water column the higher the s value the less exchange between the upper and lower layers of the reservoir and the more stable the stratification structure 2 2 2 calculation of hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of all water samples were measured on a laser absorption water isotope spectrometer analyzer iwa 35d ep liquid water isotope analyzer lgr company usa at the state key laboratory of

chla concentration was at least 1 5 times the average chla concentration in the first 5 of the water column leach et al 2018 3 results 3 1 spatial variations of water temperature ph do and hydrogen oxygen isotopic composition in the mixing and stratified periods the thermal stratification of the xajr exhibited significant seasonal variation and spatial heterogeneity fig 1b due to the strong hydrodynamic condition the thermal stratification index in the riverine region s1 was low throughout the year indicating a mixed state in this region the thermal stratification in the transition region s2 and the central part of the reservoir s3 s4 gradually developed from april and the thermal stratification index reached its peak in summer during this period the stratification structure remained stable in winter the thermal stratification index was lowest indicating a vertical mixing of the water column fig 1b both ph and do changes along the water column were affected by thermal stratification and showed similar seasonal stratification there was no obvious stratification of ph and do concentrations in the water column during the mixing period however ph and do concentrations were slightly higher in the upstream water than those of the central part of the reservoir fig 2 c e on the contrary both ph and do concentrations exhibited significant stratification in reservoir stratification the maximum vertical difference in ph reached 2 5 in the central part of the reservoir with ph values above 10 in the epilimnion the do concentration also exhibited similar changes to ph reaching above 10 mg l in surface water bodies while dropping below 4 mg l in bottom water bodies fig 2d f it is worth noting that the do concentration had a low value area near 10 m in the central part of the reservoir during the stratified period fig 2f the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of natural water at different aging times vary considerably due to the strong fractionation effect of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes which can be used to distinguish the migration of water masses in the river reservoir system gat 1996 kendall and tyler 2001 the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of the xajr were also affected by thermal stratification fig 2g j along the river the average values of both δd and δ18o both gradually increased but the average value of s4 was slightly lower than that of s3 in the mixing period along the water column the variation trends of δd and δ18o values were basically the same and showed a gradual decrease from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion in addition the variation ranges of δd and δ18o along the water column of the xajr were larger in the stratified period than in the mixing period 3 2 spatial and temporal variations of scm chla is an important indicator of phytoplankton abundance in water the distribution of chla concentration in xajr showed great spatial heterogeneity and seasonal variation fig 3 from spring to autumn the maximum concentration of chla in the region s1 and the region s2 was maintained above 10 μg l except for july when continuous rainfall in the upstream increased the water turbidity of the region s1 and restricted the growth of phytoplankton fig 3a 3b unlike the region s1 and the region s2 the maximum chla concentration in the central part of the reservoir s3 s4 began to increase significantly from june fig 3c 3d chla maxima in the central part of the reservoir s3 s4 were significantly higher in august than in other months reaching 24 99 μg l and 11 73 μg l in s3 and s4 respectively since september the concentration of chla in the whole reservoir decreased significantly reaching the lowest in winter the depth of chla maxima in the xajr was also spatially heterogeneous and varied seasonally at the spatial scale the depth of chla maxima gradually deepened along the direction of the river in the river region s1 and the transition region s2 of the xajr the depth of chla maxima developed mainly in the epilimnion with no obvious downward trend throughout the year and there was no significant scm phenomenon observed in these two regions the chla maxima in these regions were significantly higher in warm seasons than in cold seasons fig 3e 3f however the variation of the chla maxima depth in the central part of the reservoir s3 s4 had a more obvious seasonal variation there was an obvious scm phenomenon in s3 and s4 regions from june to august and scm was also observed in s4 region in october since june the depth of chla maxima in the central part of the reservoir gradually developed from the epilimnion to the thermocline with the depth of chla maxima in s3 reaching the deepest 6 m in august and that in s4 reaching the deepest 6 9 m in october meanwhile the chla maxima in the central part of the reservoir also increased with the chla maxima in s3 and s4 both reaching their peak in august fig 3g 3h as the temperature dropped in autumn the depth of chla maxima in the central part of the reservoir gradually became shallower in winter the depth of chla maxima in the central part of the reservoir remained in the epilimnion and the depth of chla maxima was significantly lower in this period than in summer fig 3g 3h 3 3 spatial and seasonal distribution of dissolved nutrients the distribution of dissolved nutrients in the xajr showed great spatial heterogeneity and seasonal variation the dsi concentrations in the xajr ranged from 48 21 to 227 51 μm with an annual average value of 110 36 34 29 μm along the course of the river the dsi concentrations showed a gradual decrease in general and the range of variation was significantly smaller in winter than in other seasons fig 4 a the main form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the xajr was nitrate with concentrations ranging from 4 84 to 25 μμ and an annual average value of 12 58 4 19 μm nitrate concentrations followed the same trend as dsi along the river fig 4b the dip concentration of xajr was very low with concentrations ranging from 0 03 to 0 68 μm and an annual average value of 0 32 0 13 μm whose variation trend along the river direction was also consistent with that of dsi and nitrate 3 4 vertical changes in nutrients par and chla during scm development thermal stratification events have an important impact on the distribution of nutrients in the vertical section of reservoir water wang 2020 however since scm development requires sufficient nutrients and light the distribution of nutrients and par along the water column can aid in understanding the mechanisms of scm development white and matsumoto 2012 summertime stratification of dissolved nutrients and par along the water column is depicted in fig 5 and is closely linked to the depth of the scm layer the variation range of dip concentration in the riverine region s1 and transition region s2 was obviously smaller than that in the central part of the reservoir s3 s4 ranging from s1 38 s2 89 s4 316 s3 650 the vertical distribution of dip concentration responds well to the depth of scm layer for example in the s3 region the dip concentration was 0 13 μm in the upper water layer of the scm and 0 45 μm in the lower water layer with a variability of 359 fig 5c the patterns of nitrate and dsi concentrations were similar fig 5g k however the vertical distribution of dissolved co2 concentrations was clearly stratified in different regions of the reservoir and all were highly sensitive to the depth of the chla maxima layer fig 5m p in all four sampling regions very low dissolved co2 concentrations less than 0 1 μm were observed in the water above the chla maxima layer a significant increase in the dissolved co2 concentration was observed in the water layer beneath the chla maxima layer with the dissolved co2 concentration increasing to more than 10 μm near 10 m underwater fig 5m p furthermore the lowest concentrations of dissolved nutrients were found at the water surface the highest dip and no3 concentrations were found near 10 m underwater while dsi and dissolved co2 concentrations gradually increased with water depth by comparing the distribution of chla concentrations along the water column it was found that the water layer below the depth of chla maxima had higher concentrations of dissolved nutrients in addition the depth of chla maxima was located at the surface water with higher par in s1 and s2 regions however the scm phenomenon was observed in s3 and s4 regions where the depth of chla maxima was located underwater with lower par which was about 1 to 10 of the par at the water surface 3 5 analysis of stoichiometric ratios of nutrients there were seasonal changes in the nutrient limiting factors for phytoplankton growth fig 6 a b during the cold season such as march april and december phytoplankton growth in the reservoir was primarily hampered by phosphorus fig 6a during the warm season such as june august and october dissolved co2 limitation occurred fig 6b nutrient limiting conditions also varied greatly along the water column fig 6c d dissolved co2 was the main nutrient limiting factor for phytoplankton growth in the 0 to 10 m water column fig 6d however the limitation of phytoplankton growth gradually transformed to phosphorus limitation in the water column below 10 m fig 6c 4 discussion 4 1 effect of thermal stratification on ph do and vertical distribution of nutrients the vertical distribution of ph do and nutrients is greatly influenced by the thermal stratification of the reservoir after entering the reservoir the river velocity gradually slowed down and the water transparency increased thus promoting the development of water thermal stratification and photosynthesis in the epilimnion from s1 to s4 the intensity of thermal stratification gradually increased with the gradual increase of hydraulic retention time which was similar to the results of previous studies straškraba and hocking 2002 and proved that higher retention time leads to stronger thermal stratification the intense photosynthesis of the epilimnion particularly during thermal stratification consumes a large amount of dissolved co2 which alters the carbonic acid balance of the water bodies and results in a significant increase in ph along with the production of large amounts of oxygen and a significant increase in the dissolved oxygen concentration aviles and neil 2007 however due to reservoir stratification the vertical mixing of water was limited and the epilimnion with high dissolved oxygen and ph could not be exchanged with the deeper water bodies meanwhile microbial respiration further reduced the do concentration and ph of the water resulting in low ph and dissolved oxygen in the middle and bottom water bodies yang et al 2020 liang et al 2019 the ph and do concentrations in the xajr exhibited consistent changes with the intensity of thermal stratification fig 2c f indicating that thermal stratification has a controlling effect on the photosynthesis respiration balance wang 2020 the above process also has an important impact on the nutrient concentration in the water column on the one hand during reservoir stratification period phytoplankton in the epilimnion grew rapidly leading to rapid depletion of nutrients on the other hand the strong water stratification prevented the epilimnion from mixing with the deeper water bodies containing high concentrations of nutrients and dissolved co2 wang 2020 zagarese et al 2021 changes in various nutrients and dissolved co2 concentrations along the water column in the xajr in august indicated that differences in thermal stratification also had an impact on the vertical distribution of nutrients differences in the distribution of various nutrients along the water column were obviously smaller in the riverine region with lower stratification than in the central part of the reservoir with higher stratification fig 5 4 2 effect of thermal stratification on water mass movement due to the dam s retention effect reservoir water is held for a much longer period of time than water from upstream rivers friedl and wüest 2002 the longer the water remains in the reservoir system the greater the effect of evaporation this leads to the preferential entry of light isotopes into the atmosphere which results in progressively heavier δ18o and δd in the water gonfiantini 1978 as a result the δ18o and δd of water are more negative in the riverine regions with short water retention time and heavier in the central part of the reservoir with long water retention time zhang et al 2018 in this study seasonal variations in water mass movement patterns were observed based on the degree of fractionation in the riverine region and in the central part of the reservoir fig 2g j the magnitude of variation of δ18o and δd in the water column during the mixing period was lower than that during the stratified period demonstrating that the reservoir evaporation is greater in summer than in winter therefore the difference of δ18o and δd between river inflow and reservoir water can be used to judge the movement process of water masses river water with more negative values of δ18o and δd intruded into the reservoir through the middle and lower layers of the water column during the stratification period fig 2h j this occurred due to the higher temperature and lower density of the epilimnion when the thermal stratification of the reservoir was formed the incoming water from the river has lower temperature and higher density and therefore moves forward along the middle level of the water body with similar density 4 3 nutrients supply and limiting factors for phytoplankton growth in general nutrient supply for algae growth in reservoirs is primarily provided by upstream inputs sediment release dry and wet atmospheric deposition and algal decomposition the primary source of nutrients in the xajr is the upstream river which receives industrial agricultural and urban sewage from the basin as evidenced by the high nutrient concentrations in the riverine region s1 fig 4 during thermal stratification period the upstream water mass flowed into the reservoir along the middle and lower layers of the water column density supplementing nutrients to the middle layer of the water column secondly the reservoir sediments accumulated a large amount of nutrients during the thermal stratification season anoxic conditions in the bottom promote the release of phosphorus from the sediments which diffuses to the overlying water body amirbahman et al 2003 2012 the mechanisms of phosphorus release from sediments are mainly molecular diffusion processes and sediment resuspension phosphorus release has been shown to be wind driven in shallow lakes søndergaard et al 1992 however during stable stratification phosphorus release from sediments in deep water lakes such as xajr occurs mainly in the form of slow molecular diffusion moreover in our study the bottom water of the xajr did not reach the anoxic condition so the phosphorus release from the sediment may be insignificant for the supply of nutrients to the scm layer besides microbial decomposition after algal mortality resulted in nutrient release during thermal stratification algal mortality and decomposition may occur in the thermocline and dissolved nutrients released by algae are recharged to the middle water bodies we also confirmed the importance of carbon limitation for phytoplankton growth in reservoirs which has been overlooked in previous studies ralph 2002 schindler et al 1972 during the warm season dissolved co2 in the epilimnion was limited fig 6b d as a result of co2 depletion caused by the high growth rate of algae flynn and raven 2017 however carbon enrichment mechanisms ccms in algae are often expensive even if there is sufficient dic in the water dissolved co2 can still limit the growth of algae hammer et al 2019 burris et al 1981 for instance studies have shown that the abundance of some harmful algae e g cyanobacteria is negatively correlated with pco2 van dam et al 2018 with the exception of nutrient limitation the importance of light restriction has also been extensively studied the shading effect formed by massive algal growth also affects the penetration of light into the water column flynn and raven 2017 experiments have confirmed that phytoplankton biomass increases with increasing light radiation huisman 1999 laws and bannister 1980 however our study found that in the central part of the reservoir although there was sufficient light radiation in the surface water the depth of the chla maxima was located in the subsurface layer of the water column with low par ecological studies have proposed that algae existed to adapt to weak light and that strong light radiation in surface water inhibits photosynthesis of algae behrendeld m j 1997 however in s1 and s2 regions severe algal blooms occurred in the surface water under sufficient light radiation demonstrating that the development of the scm layer is influenced by multiple factors 4 4 development mechanism of scm layer the seasonal variation of thermal stratification and depth of the chla maxima layer figs 2 3 confirms that the reservoir scm is associated with thermal streatification events due to strong hydrodynamics and weak thermal stratification the riverine region s1 had high nutrient concentrations and insignificant stratification along the water column as a result of the continuous supply of nutrients for phytoplankton growth the depth of chla maxima in this region occurred mainly in the epilimnion during the warm season the transition region s2 gradually developed a certain degree of thermal stratification but due to the influence of nutrient input from the upstream river the nutrients in the epilimnion of this region were rapidly replenished thus the depth of chla maxima does not have an obvious tendency to develop in deeper waters with increasing stratification intensity the depth of chla maxima in the central part of the reservoir gradually deepens and the scm phenomenon is formed in the region scm depths of 5 m or more can be developed during the intense thermal stratification in this region above the scm layer the main limiting factor for phytoplankton growth is dissolved co2 in the water fig 6d the high concentration of nutrients and dissolved co2 in the water layer beneath the scm layer provides nutrients for the development of the scm layer fig 5 during thermal stratification nutrient exchange between the epilimnion and the lower water layer is severely hampered therefore the movement pattern of the upstream water mass plays an important role in the development of the scm the main movement patterns of the upstream water masses along rivers and the sources of nutrient supply for scm layer development are listed fig 7 under the influence of the difference in water density during stratification the upper water mass gradually moves in the form of density currents invading from the middle and lower layers of the riverine region to the central part of the reservoir fig 7 in this process some of the nutrients carried by the river are supplied directly to the scm layer while the remainder settles to the bottom in the form of particles in the central part of the reservoir the lack of nutrients limited the growth of phytoplankton despite the availability of sufficient light radiation in the epilimnion as the upstream water mass moves down in depth nutrients in the middle water bodies are replenished in the central part of the reservoir fig 5 the adequate supply of nutrients and dissolved co2 in the middle water layers provides a favorable environment for the development of scm in addition the release of nutrients from the underwater sediments further replenishes the nutrient concentration in the middle layer although the middle and lower water layers were well supplied with nutrients light radiation is still essential for the growth of algae and the euphotic depth 1 penetration depth of par of the water column is an important factor limiting the further downward movement of scm leach et al 2018 liu et al 2020 which is consistent with our results that the scm depth is above the euphotic layer of water fig 5 according to the research on the mechanism of the scm phenomenon development in the xajr the chla concentration maxima in the central part of the reservoir during the thermal stratification period were more than twice the chla concentration in surface water therefore in this period for the water column above the euphotic layer of the water column multiple layers of water depth need to be selected for the collection of water samples in order to more accurately assess the nutrient status of the reservoir 5 conclusion the evolution of the scm phenomenon in xajr was found to be closely related to the change in thermal stratification scm occurred mainly during periods of high reservoir thermal stratification intensity on the time scale the well mixed water bodies and lower air temperatures during the cold season were not conducive to the formation of scm from a spatial perspective the thermal stratification intensity gradually increased from the riverine region to the central part of the reservoir and the scm phenomenon mainly occurred in the central part of the reservoir with high thermal stratification intensity do and ph were also stratified in the same way indicating a significant effect of thermal stratification on the photosynthesis of algae in water the main limiting factors for phytoplankton growth were nutrients and light radiation according to the stoichiometric limitation analysis phosphorus was the main nutrient limiting factor during the cold season while during the warm season the water column above the scm layer was deficient in dissolved co2 due to strong photosynthesis which became the primary nutrient limiting factor as thermal stratification impedes vertical exchange in the water body resulting in insufficient nutrient supply in the epilimnion the main accumulation area of algae gradually moves toward the thermocline the primary source of nutrients for this process is the inflow of river water into the central part of the reservoir along the water column through the middle and lower layers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15677,in marine investigations the maximum chlorophyll a chla concentration is often reported to occur at a specific depth below the ocean surface a phenomenon known as subsurface chla maxima scm however scm has long been overlooked in artificial reservoirs which may lead to a serious underestimation of the primary productivity level and trophic status of reservoirs to better understand the temporal and spatial variability of scm and the mechanisms leading to scm development this study conducted a detailed survey in a large subtropical reservoir xinanjiang reservoir xajr from september 2020 to august 2021 the seasonal thermal stratification in situ variables wt ph do and chla nutrient concentrations dsi no3 dip and dco2 chla maxima depth and magnitude of the riverine region s1 transition region s2 and the central part of the xajr s3 and s4 were all thoroughly investigated thermal stratification and scm in xajr exhibited significant seasonal and spatial heterogeneity phytoplankton biomass in the epilimnion was limited by dissolved co2 from june to october in the warm seasons while it was primarily limited by phosphorus in the other seasons according to the nutrient limitation analysis along the water column dissolved co2 limitation occurred mainly above the scm layer and the water column below the scm layer gradually transitioned from dissolved co2 limitation to phosphorus limitation furthermore as the thermal stratification developed the upstream water mass moves along the middle of the water column as density flow toward the reservoir providing nutrients for the development of the scm this research contributes to a better understanding of the temporal and spatial variation of scm and nutrient supply in deep and large stratified reservoirs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords subsurface chlorophyll a maxima seasonal thermal stratification dissolved co2 limitation large subtropical reservoir data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the phenomenon of subsurface chlorophyll a chla concentration maxima scm refers to the occurrence of maximum chla concentration at a specific depth below the water surface a phenomenon that was firstly observed during oceanic surveys cordeiro et al 2013 cullen 1982 the phytoplankton biomass accumulates and grows abundantly in a specific depth range usually a few centimeters to several meters due to the interaction of light nutrient gradients and thermal stratification resulting in the formation of a thin plankton layer durham and stocker 2012 also known as the maximum chla layer located in the subsurface or deep layer the scm layer contributes significantly to the primary productivity of the water column for example in the arctic ocean the scm layer accounts for 65 90 of the total primary productivity of the water column martin et al 2010 2013 recently similar phenomena have been occasionally reported in inland waters such as natural lakes and artificial reservoirs reinl et al 2020 giling et al 2017 leach et al 2018 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd defines a lake as eutrophic when the chla concentration exceeds 8 μg l oecd 1982 in the xinanjiang reservoir in china the maximum value of scm layer was sometimes 7 8 times higher than chla at the surface reaching about 30 μg l and the maximum depth of scm was about 5 m underwater liu et al 2020 however this underwater algal bloom layer consisting of a thin layer with high chla concentration is often ignored in current lake and reservoir water quality assessment and water sampling strategies e g gb3838 2002 chinese water quality standards furthermore the obvious difference in trophic status between the epilimnion layer and the scm layer suggests that there are deficiencies in the assessment of trophic status in deep and large reservoirs as a result the research on the mechanisms of the development of the scm phenomenon particularly in deep and large reservoirs as a source of urban drinking water is beneficial to improve the method of inland water quality evaluation neglecting scm may expose the safety of urban drinking water to potential hazards such as water quality deterioration caused by algal toxins and their derivatives produced by algal growth and metabolism hudnell 2009 many factors influence the magnitude and depth of the scm with effective light radiation levels vertical distribution of nutrients and thermal stratification of the water column being the most important abiotic factors abbott et al 1984 cullen 2015 valenti et al 2015 the main biological factors are considered to be phytoplankton growth rates microbial food webs and zooplankton grazing camacho 2006 sommer et al 2012 lofton et al 2020 during the thermal stratification season the vertical distribution of nutrients along the water column is usually uneven leading to changes in the magnitude and depth of the scm layers cleeg et al 2007 descy et al 2010 in addition horizontal movement of water masses such as those intruding from upstream rivers may influence scm formation by continuously transporting nutrients to specific depths durham and stocker 2012 currently few studies on scm in inland waters have been conducted mainly focusing on a few large natural lakes reinl et al 2020 hamilton et al 2010 leach et al 2018 beisher and longhi 2013 brentrup et al 2016 recently liu liu et al 2020 reported the spatial distribution of scm in spring and summer of a large artificial reservoir but its seasonal development process and the mechanisms leading to the development of scm are rarely documented studying the mechanisms of scm formation in large reservoirs is critical for the assessment of the hot spot of primary productivity leach et al 2018 and trophic status of water bodies artificial reservoirs are obviously different from marine and natural lakes in terms of retention time storage cycle drainage mode and hydrological regulating capacity furthermore most reservoirs have subsurface currents that influence water temperature dissolved oxygen gradients and nutrient retention times all of which can influence the formation of scm in addition previous studies have highlighted the effects of changes in nutrient concentration in the water column on scm development beckmann and hense 2007 liu et al 2020 but studies on the effects of nutrient stoichiometry are lacking freshwater ecosystem studies have found that the redfield ratio is higher in lakes than in oceans reaching c n p 166 20 1 redfield 1958 sterner et al 2008 in general the amount of phytoplankton biomass in lakes is believed to be limited mainly by n or p due to the high concentration of dic in lakes and reservoirs the limiting role of dic has long been overlooked in nutrient limitation analyses in fact photosynthesis in freshwater phytoplankton preferentially absorbs dissolved co2 from the water rather than hco3 or co3 2 meyer and griffiths 2013 this process leads to depletion of dissolved co2 in water especially in the upper layers of water with strong photosynthesis thus despite high dic concentrations in the water dissolved co2 required by algae for photosynthesis may be lacking which can potentially limit algae growth zagarese et al 2021 for this reason dissolved co2 was included in the nutrient limitation analysis of this study in this study a large reservoir in the qiantang river basin of eastern china xinanjiang reservoir xajr was selected for a detailed investigation of the formation and environmental driving factors of scm this reservoir is the largest artificial freshwater lake in china and an important water source in the yangtze river delta region of china with large storage capacity and strong regulating capacity the main objectives of this study include 1 to reveal the vertical and horizontal seasonal changes of scm 2 to examine the effects of water mass movement patterns on nutrient supply in different seasons 3 to study the seasonal and vertical limitations of phosphorus and dissolved co2 on algae growth 2 study area and methodology 2 1 study area and

reservoir water mainly comes from surface runoff with the xin an river being the main incoming surface runoff accounting for about 70 of the total inflow li et al 2018 from 2003 to 2012 the trophic state gradually changed from oligotrophic to mesotrophic sheng et al 2015 water samples were collected monthly from september 2020 to august 2021 at four points s1 s2 s3 and s4 along a gradient from the river to the xajr dam except for february 2021 which was not sampled due to covid 19 fig 1 four to six layers of water were collected at each sampling site depending on the water depth with

a v e r a g e where δ t is the temperature difference between surface water and bottom water t a v e r a g e is the average temperature of the water column the higher the s value the less exchange between the upper and lower layers of the reservoir and the more stable the stratification structure 2 2 2 calculation of hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic

chla concentration was at least 1 5 times the average chla concentration in the first 5 of the water column leach et al 2018 3 results 3 1 spatial variations of water temperature ph do and hydrogen oxygen isotopic composition in the mixing and stratified periods the thermal stratification of the xajr exhibited significant seasonal variation and spatial heterogeneity fig 1b due to the strong hydrodynamic condition the thermal stratification index in the riverine region s1 was low throughout the year indicating a mixed state in this region the thermal stratification in the transition region s2 and the central part of the reservoir s3 s4 gradually developed from april and the thermal stratification index reached its peak in summer during this period the stratification structure remained stable in winter the thermal stratification index was lowest indicating a vertical mixing of the water column fig 1b both ph and do changes along the water column were affected by thermal stratification and showed similar seasonal stratification there was no obvious stratification of ph and do concentrations in the water column during the mixing period however ph and do concentrations were slightly higher in the upstream water than those of the central part of the reservoir fig 2 c e on the contrary both ph and do concentrations exhibited significant stratification in reservoir stratification the maximum vertical difference in ph reached 2 5 in the central part of the reservoir with ph values above 10 in the epilimnion the do concentration also exhibited similar changes to ph reaching above 10 mg l in surface water bodies while dropping below 4 mg l in bottom water bodies fig 2d f it is worth noting that the do concentration had a low value area near 10 m in the central part of the reservoir during the stratified period fig 2f the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of natural water at different aging times vary considerably due to the strong fractionation effect of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes which can be used to distinguish the migration of water masses in the river reservoir system gat 1996 kendall and tyler 2001 the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of the xajr were also affected by thermal stratification fig 2g j along the river the average values of both δd and δ18o both gradually increased but the average value of s4 was slightly lower than that of s3 in the mixing period along the water column the variation trends of δd and δ18o values were basically the same and showed a gradual decrease from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion in addition the variation ranges of δd and δ18o along the water column of the xajr were larger in the stratified period than in the mixing period 3 2 spatial and temporal variations of scm chla is an important indicator of phytoplankton abundance in water the distribution of chla concentration in xajr showed great spatial heterogeneity and seasonal variation fig 3 from spring to autumn the maximum concentration of chla in the region s1 and the region s2 was maintained above 10 μg l except for july when continuous rainfall in the upstream increased the water turbidity of the region s1 and restricted the growth of phytoplankton fig 3a 3b unlike the region s1 and the region s2 the maximum chla concentration in the central part of the reservoir s3 s4 began to increase significantly from june fig 3c 3d chla maxima in the central part of the reservoir s3 s4 were significantly higher in august than in other months reaching 24 99 μg l and 11 73 μg l in s3 and s4 respectively since september the concentration of chla in the whole reservoir decreased significantly reaching the lowest in winter the depth of chla maxima in the xajr was also spatially heterogeneous and varied seasonally at the spatial scale the depth of chla maxima gradually deepened along the direction of the river in the river region s1 and the transition region s2 of the xajr the depth of chla maxima developed mainly in the epilimnion with no obvious downward trend throughout the year and there was no significant scm phenomenon observed in these two regions the chla maxima in these regions were significantly higher in warm seasons than in cold seasons fig 3e 3f however the variation of the chla maxima depth in the central part of the reservoir s3 s4 had a more obvious seasonal variation there was an obvious scm phenomenon in s3 and s4 regions from june to august and scm was also observed in s4 region in october since june the depth of chla maxima in the central part of the reservoir gradually developed from the epilimnion to the thermocline with the depth of chla maxima in s3 reaching the deepest 6 m in august and that in s4 reaching the deepest 6 9 m in october meanwhile the chla maxima in the central part of the reservoir also increased with the chla maxima in s3 and s4 both reaching their peak in august fig 3g 3h as the temperature dropped in autumn the depth of chla maxima in the central part of the reservoir gradually became shallower in winter the depth of chla maxima in the central part of the reservoir remained in the epilimnion and the depth of chla maxima was significantly lower in this period than in summer fig 3g 3h 3 3 spatial and seasonal distribution of dissolved nutrients the distribution of dissolved nutrients in the xajr showed great spatial heterogeneity and seasonal variation the dsi concentrations in the xajr ranged from 48 21 to 227 51 μm with an annual average value of 110 36 34 29 μm along the course of the river the dsi concentrations showed a gradual decrease in general and the range of variation was significantly smaller in winter than in other seasons fig 4 a the main form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the xajr was nitrate with concentrations ranging from 4 84 to 25 μμ and an annual average value of 12 58 4 19 μm nitrate concentrations followed the same trend as dsi along the river fig 4b the dip concentration of xajr was very low with concentrations ranging from 0 03 to 0 68 μm and an annual average value of 0 32 0 13 μm whose variation trend along the river direction was also consistent with that of dsi and nitrate 3 4 vertical changes in nutrients par and chla during scm development thermal stratification events have an important impact on the distribution of nutrients in the vertical section of reservoir water wang 2020 however since scm development requires sufficient nutrients and light the distribution of nutrients and par along the water column can aid in understanding the mechanisms of scm development white and matsumoto 2012 summertime stratification of dissolved nutrients and par along the water column is depicted in fig 5 and is closely linked to the depth of the scm layer the variation range of dip concentration in the riverine region s1 and transition region s2 was obviously smaller than that in the central part of the reservoir s3 s4 ranging from s1 38 s2 89 s4 316 s3 650 the vertical distribution of dip concentration responds well to the depth of scm layer for example in the s3 region the dip concentration was 0 13 μm in the upper water layer of the scm and 0 45 μm in the lower water layer with a variability of 359 fig 5c the patterns of nitrate and dsi concentrations were similar fig 5g k however the vertical distribution of dissolved co2 concentrations was clearly stratified in different regions of the reservoir and all were highly sensitive to the depth of the chla maxima layer fig 5m p in all four sampling regions very low dissolved co2 concentrations less than 0 1 μm were observed in the water above the chla maxima layer a significant increase in the dissolved co2 concentration was observed in the water layer beneath the chla maxima layer with the dissolved co2 concentration increasing to more than 10 μm near 10 m underwater fig 5m p furthermore the lowest concentrations of dissolved nutrients were found at the water surface the highest dip and no3 concentrations were found near 10 m underwater while dsi and dissolved co2 concentrations gradually increased with water depth by comparing the distribution of chla concentrations along the water column it was found that the water layer below the depth of chla maxima had higher concentrations of dissolved nutrients in addition the depth of chla maxima was located at the surface water with higher par in s1 and s2 regions however the scm phenomenon was observed in s3 and s4 regions where the depth of chla maxima was located underwater with lower par which was about 1 to 10 of the par at the water surface 3 5 analysis of stoichiometric ratios of nutrients there were seasonal changes in the nutrient limiting factors for phytoplankton growth fig 6 a b during the cold season such as march april and december phytoplankton growth in the reservoir was primarily hampered by phosphorus fig 6a during the warm season such as june august and october dissolved co2 limitation occurred fig 6b nutrient limiting conditions also varied greatly along the water column fig 6c d dissolved co2 was the main nutrient limiting factor for phytoplankton growth in the 0 to 10 m water column fig 6d however the limitation of phytoplankton growth gradually transformed to phosphorus limitation in the water column below 10 m fig 6c 4 discussion 4 1 effect of thermal stratification on ph do and vertical distribution of nutrients the vertical distribution of ph do and nutrients is greatly influenced by the thermal stratification of the reservoir after entering the reservoir the river velocity gradually slowed down and the water transparency increased thus promoting the development of water thermal stratification and photosynthesis in the epilimnion from s1 to s4 the intensity of thermal stratification gradually increased with the gradual increase of hydraulic retention time which was similar to the results of previous studies straškraba and hocking 2002 and proved that higher retention time leads to stronger thermal stratification the intense photosynthesis of the epilimnion particularly during thermal stratification consumes a large amount of dissolved co2 which alters the carbonic acid balance of the water bodies and results in a significant increase in ph along with the production of large amounts of oxygen and a significant increase in the dissolved oxygen concentration aviles and neil 2007 however due to reservoir stratification the vertical mixing of water was limited and the epilimnion with high dissolved oxygen and ph could not be exchanged with the deeper water bodies meanwhile microbial respiration further reduced the do concentration and ph of the water resulting in low ph and dissolved oxygen in the middle and bottom water bodies yang et al 2020 liang et al 2019 the ph and do concentrations in the xajr exhibited consistent changes with the intensity of thermal stratification fig 2c f indicating that thermal stratification has a controlling effect on the photosynthesis respiration balance wang 2020 the above process also has an important impact on the nutrient concentration in the water column on the one hand during reservoir stratification period phytoplankton in the epilimnion grew rapidly leading to rapid depletion of nutrients on the other hand the strong water stratification prevented the epilimnion from mixing with the deeper water bodies containing high concentrations of nutrients and dissolved co2 wang 2020 zagarese et al 2021 changes in various nutrients and dissolved co2 concentrations along the water column in the xajr in august indicated that differences in thermal stratification also had an impact on the vertical distribution of nutrients differences in the distribution of various nutrients along the water column were obviously smaller in the riverine region with lower stratification than in the central part of the reservoir with higher stratification fig 5 4 2 effect of thermal stratification on water mass movement due to the dam s retention effect reservoir water is held for a much longer period of time than water from upstream rivers friedl and wüest 2002 the longer the water remains in the reservoir system the greater the effect of evaporation this leads to the preferential entry of light isotopes into the atmosphere which results in progressively heavier δ18o and δd in the water gonfiantini 1978 as a result the δ18o and δd of water are more negative in the riverine regions with short water retention time and heavier in the central part of the reservoir with long water retention time zhang et al 2018 in this study seasonal variations in water mass movement patterns were observed based on the degree of fractionation in the riverine region and in the central part of the reservoir fig 2g j the magnitude of variation of δ18o and δd in the water column during the mixing period was lower than that during the stratified period demonstrating that the reservoir evaporation is greater in summer than in winter therefore the difference of δ18o and δd between river inflow and reservoir water can be used to judge the movement process of water masses river water with more negative values of δ18o and δd intruded into the reservoir through the middle and lower layers of the water column during the stratification period fig 2h j this occurred due to the higher temperature and lower density of the epilimnion when the thermal stratification of the reservoir was formed the incoming water from the river has lower temperature and higher density and therefore moves forward along the middle level of the water body with similar density 4 3 nutrients supply and limiting factors for phytoplankton growth in general nutrient supply for algae growth in reservoirs is primarily provided by upstream inputs sediment release dry and wet atmospheric deposition and algal decomposition the primary source of nutrients in the xajr is the upstream river which receives industrial agricultural and urban sewage from the basin as evidenced by the high nutrient concentrations in the riverine region s1 fig 4 during thermal stratification period the upstream water mass flowed into the reservoir along the middle and lower layers of the water column density supplementing nutrients to the middle layer of the water column secondly the reservoir sediments accumulated a large amount of nutrients during the thermal stratification season anoxic conditions in the bottom promote the release of phosphorus from the sediments which diffuses to the overlying water body amirbahman et al 2003 2012 the mechanisms of phosphorus release from sediments are mainly molecular diffusion processes and sediment resuspension phosphorus release has been shown to be wind driven in shallow lakes søndergaard et al 1992 however during stable stratification phosphorus release from sediments in deep water lakes such as xajr occurs mainly in the form of slow molecular diffusion moreover in our study the bottom water of the xajr did not reach the anoxic condition so the phosphorus release from the sediment may be insignificant for the supply of nutrients to the scm layer besides microbial decomposition after algal mortality resulted in nutrient release during thermal stratification algal mortality and decomposition may occur in the thermocline and dissolved nutrients released by algae are recharged to the middle water bodies we also confirmed the importance of carbon limitation for phytoplankton growth in reservoirs which has been overlooked in previous studies ralph 2002 schindler et al 1972 during the warm season dissolved co2 in the epilimnion was limited fig 6b d as a result of co2 depletion caused by the high growth rate of algae flynn and raven 2017 however carbon enrichment mechanisms ccms in algae are often expensive even if there is sufficient dic in the water dissolved co2 can still limit the growth of algae hammer et al 2019 burris et al 1981 for instance studies have shown that the abundance of some harmful algae e g cyanobacteria is negatively correlated with pco2 van dam et al 2018 with the exception of nutrient limitation the importance of light restriction has also been extensively studied the shading effect formed by massive algal growth also affects the penetration of light into the water column flynn and raven 2017 experiments have confirmed that phytoplankton biomass increases with increasing light radiation huisman 1999 laws and bannister 1980 however our study found that in the central part of the reservoir although there was sufficient light radiation in the surface water the depth of the chla maxima was located in the subsurface layer of the water column with low par ecological studies have proposed that algae existed to adapt to weak light and that strong light radiation in surface water inhibits photosynthesis of algae behrendeld m j 1997 however in s1 and s2 regions severe algal blooms occurred in the surface water under sufficient light radiation demonstrating that the development of the scm layer is influenced by multiple factors 4 4 development mechanism of scm layer the seasonal variation of thermal stratification and depth of the chla maxima layer figs 2 3 confirms that the reservoir scm is associated with thermal streatification events due to strong hydrodynamics and weak thermal stratification the riverine region s1 had high nutrient concentrations and insignificant stratification along the water column as a result of the continuous supply of nutrients for phytoplankton growth the depth of chla maxima in this region occurred mainly in the epilimnion during the warm season the transition region s2 gradually developed a certain degree of thermal stratification but due to the influence of nutrient input from the upstream river the nutrients in the epilimnion of this region were rapidly replenished thus the depth of chla maxima does not have an obvious tendency to develop in deeper waters with increasing stratification intensity the depth of chla maxima in the central part of the reservoir gradually deepens and the scm phenomenon is formed in the region scm depths of 5 m or more can be developed during the intense thermal stratification in this region above the scm layer the main limiting factor for phytoplankton growth is dissolved co2 in the water fig 6d the high concentration of nutrients and dissolved co2 in the water layer beneath the scm layer provides nutrients for the development of the scm layer fig 5 during thermal stratification nutrient exchange between the epilimnion and the lower water layer is severely hampered therefore the movement pattern of the upstream water mass plays an important role in the development of the scm the main movement patterns of the upstream water masses along rivers and the sources of nutrient supply for scm layer development are listed fig 7 under the influence of the difference in water density during stratification the upper water mass gradually moves in the form of density currents invading from the middle and lower layers of the riverine region to the central part of the reservoir fig 7 in this process some of the nutrients carried by the river are supplied directly to the scm layer while the remainder settles to the bottom in the form of particles in the central part of the reservoir the lack of nutrients limited the growth of phytoplankton despite the availability of sufficient light radiation in the epilimnion as the upstream water mass moves down in depth nutrients in the middle water bodies are replenished in the central part of the reservoir fig 5 the adequate supply of nutrients and dissolved co2 in the middle water layers provides a favorable environment for the development of scm in addition the release of nutrients from the underwater sediments further replenishes the nutrient concentration in the middle layer although the middle and lower water layers were well supplied with nutrients light radiation is still essential for the growth of algae and the euphotic depth 1 penetration depth of par of the water column is an important factor limiting the further downward movement of scm leach et al 2018 liu et al 2020 which is consistent with our results that the scm depth is above the euphotic layer of water fig 5 according to the research on the mechanism of the scm phenomenon development in the xajr the chla concentration maxima in the central part of the reservoir during the thermal stratification period were more than twice the chla concentration in surface water therefore in this period for the water column above the euphotic layer of the water column multiple layers of water depth need to be selected for the collection of water samples in order to more accurately assess the nutrient status of the reservoir 5 conclusion the evolution of the scm phenomenon in xajr was found to be closely related to the change in thermal stratification scm occurred mainly during periods of high reservoir thermal stratification intensity on the time scale the well mixed water bodies and lower air temperatures during the cold season were not conducive to the formation of scm from a spatial perspective the thermal stratification intensity gradually increased from the riverine region to the central part of the reservoir and the scm phenomenon mainly occurred in the central part of the reservoir with high thermal stratification intensity do and ph were also stratified in the same way indicating a significant effect of thermal stratification on the photosynthesis of algae in water the main limiting factors for phytoplankton growth were nutrients and light radiation according to the stoichiometric limitation analysis phosphorus was the main nutrient limiting factor during the cold season while during the warm season the water column above the scm layer was deficient in dissolved co2 due to strong photosynthesis which became the primary nutrient limiting factor as thermal stratification impedes vertical exchange in the water body resulting in insufficient nutrient supply in the epilimnion the main accumulation area of algae gradually moves toward the thermocline the primary source of nutrients for this process is the inflow of river water into the central part of the reservoir along the water column through the middle and lower layers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15678,contaminants stored in the low permeability sediments will continue to threaten the adjacent shallow groundwater system after the aquifer is remediated understanding the storage and discharge behavior of contaminants in the aquitards is essential for the efficient remediation of contaminated sites but most of the previous analytical studies focused on nonreactive solutes in a single homogenous aquitard this study presents novel analytical solutions for the forward and back diffusion of contaminants through multi layer low permeability sediments considering abiotic and biotic environmental degradation three representative source depletion patterns i e instantaneous linear and exponential patterns were selected to describe the dissolution of dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl in the aquifer more realistically at the forward diffusion stage the mass storage of contaminants in the aquitards with the instantaneous pattern is the largest nearly twice that with the exponential pattern a simple equivalent homogeneous model is generally adopted in the risk assessment however relative to the proposed multi layer model it will significantly underestimate the onset of the back diffusion of heterogeneous aquitards and overestimate the persistence of aquifer plumes the previously reported semi infinite boundary assumption is also not applicable with a maximum error of over 200 in the long term prediction of back diffusion behavior of a thin aquitard moreover when the degradation half life is less than 16 years less than 10 of the contaminants stored in the aquitards will diffuse into the overlying aquifer suggesting that biostimulation or bioaugmentation can effectively mitigate back diffusion risk overall the proposed diffusion reaction coupled model with multi layer media is of great value and high demand in predicting the back diffusion behavior of heterogeneous aquitards and guiding the soil bioremediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords back diffusion layered aquitards degradation reaction dnapl source depletion analytical solution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater contamination induced by industrial and agricultural activities poses potential threats to human health and ecosystems and thus the restoration of contaminated aquifers has attracted extensive attention however long term storage and slow release of contaminants in the underlying low permeability sediments aquitards severely hinder aquifer remediation yan et al 2016 specifically aquifer contaminants migrate from the source zone into aquitards driven by concentration gradients accumulating pollutants in the low permeability zones termed as forward diffusion when the contaminant source is depleted or isolated the aquifer concentrations decline and then the concentration gradient at the aquifer aquitard interface reverses after that the aquitards will act as a secondary source to release pollutants into the overlying aquifer creating a long term plume termed as back diffusion therefore the study on the forward and back diffusion through low permeability sediments is of great significance for the control and remediation of groundwater contamination you et al 2020 a series of field and laboratory scale experiments ball et al 1997 chapman and parker 2005 parker et al 2008 sale et al 2008 tatti et al 2018 wanner et al 2018a wilking et al 2013 yang et al 2015 have been conducted to observe and confirm the phenomena of solute exchange between high and low permeability media however these low permeability experiments are generally expensive and time consuming since diffusion dominated solute migration is considerably slow in addition it is also challenging to install measurement probes that do not disturb the soil in laboratory tests li et al 2021 and in regular site assessment the drilling cores are usually prohibitive chapman and parker 2005 parker et al 2004 as a result various numerical models chambon et al 2010 chapman et al 2012 parker et al 2008 wanner et al 2018a and analytical models brown et al 2012 ding and feng 2022 yang et al 2015 have been developed to extend and complement the limited experimental research numerical models can account for many complex scenarios such as irregularly shaped low permeability zones chapman et al 2012 and multispecies migration with competitive adsorption and degradation chambon et al 2010 however they are not generally adopted in regulatory contexts for site risk assessments due to extensive data collection requirements and high learning costs chambon et al 2011 analytical solutions require some simplifications but they were found to be quite valuable in 1 serving as screening tools to efficiently obtain the order of magnitude estimates chambon et al 2011 2 revealing the basic mechanisms of solute transport you et al 2020 and 3 providing benchmarks for numerical models ding et al 2021 based on fick s second law of diffusion parker et al 2004 proposed a one dimensional analytical model for forward and back diffusion of a contaminant in a semi infinite aquitard in which the predicted aqueous trichloroethylene concentrations were in good agreement with the field test results yang et al 2015 extended this model to a finite domain using the method of images brown et al 2012 and yang et al 2016 introduced a source mass depletion model to the back diffusion model and discussed the effect of source dissolution behavior on aquitard mass accumulation and discharge chambon et al 2011 developed a risk assessment tool for contaminant transport through low permeability fractured media by modifying the analytical solutions of tang et al 1981 they suggested that back diffusion from the matrix to the fracture system may result in a long term risk to adjacent aquifers however these prediction models are only applicable to a single low permeability layer layered low permeability sediments have been commonly observed in coastal and lakeside areas cherry et al 2004 gao and liu 2022 hendry et al 2011 xu et al 2009 due to natural deposition and consolidation fortunately ball et al 1997 and liu and ball 1998 developed an analytical solution for forward and back diffusion of nonreactive solute through a two layer porous medium however some limitations remain first this two layer model has limited applicability and cannot be generalized to any number of aquitards second an infinite depth lower boundary is inappropriate because the thickness of the low permeability sediments in practice is finite third the model ignored degradation reaction one of the main control mechanisms for contaminant transport in sediments gilevska et al 2021 wanner et al 2018b the long term importance of abiotic or biotic degradation for back diffusion has also been experimentally demonstrated damgaard et al 2013 schaefer et al 2018 wanner et al 2016 the reasonability of the above three hypotheses remains questionable and their effects on the accumulation and reverse release of contaminants through layered sedimentary aquitards should be extensively explored several researchers have proposed analytical solutions to the diffusion hickson et al 2009 trefry and whyte 1999 xie et al 2015 or advection dispersion equations feng et al 2019 guerrero et al 2013 shen and reible 2015 in multi layer porous media for example hickson et al 2009 found an exact solution to a multi layer diffusion problem using the separation of variables method their results illustrated that the time taken to heat transport depends significantly on the order of layered media these analytical studies all assumed a steady state inlet boundary condition that cannot characterize the source depletion dynamics recently carr and march 2018 developed a semi analytical approach for solving multi layer diffusion problems with a time dependent boundary condition zimmerman et al 2016 presented a semi analytical solution to axisymmetric diffusion reaction equations with continuous transient boundary conditions using laplace transform technique nevertheless these semi analytical methods failed to derive exact closed form solutions as they require numerical inversion of the laplace transform the main objectives of this study are to 1 develop novel analytical solutions capable of describing the forward and back diffusion of reactive solutes through stratified sedimentary aquitards 2 investigate the effects of source mass depletion patterns sediment heterogeneity and degradation reaction on contaminant accumulation and release 3 quantitatively characterize the differences between finite domain and semi infinite domain prediction models and 4 provide remediation recommendations for the contaminated sites with back diffusion risks 2 mathematical model 2 1 governing equations and boundary conditions fig 1 depicts the release of dissolved phase contaminants from the dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl source zone and their mass exchange between the high permeability aquifer and the low permeability aquitards the model begins with horizontal movement of groundwater flow across the dnapl source zone creating a dissolved contaminant plume in the aquifer the aqueous phase contaminants then diffuse from the aquifer into the underlying multi layer aquitards under a downward concentration gradient i e forward diffusion as the dnapl source mass is depleted the aquitards will transform from sinks to sources and release contaminants into the overlying aquifer i e back diffusion to facilitate the development of the forward and back diffusion model the following assumptions were adopted 1 each layer of the sedimentary aquitard system was assumed as homogeneous and isotropic cherry et al 2004 2 the power law function was used to describe dnapl source depletion in the subsurface aquifer falta et al 2005 parker and park 2004 3 one dimensional diffusion along the z direction was considered in low permeability zones while advection was negligible brown et al 2012 yang et al 2015 4 a single reactive species was considered without considering degradation daughter products chambon et al 2011 5 degradation reactions obeyed first order kinetics wanner et al 2018b 6 sorption process was assumed to be linear instantaneous and reversible ding et al 2020 7 material properties of aquifers and aquitards remained invariable over time in the high permeability aquifer the dissolved dnapl concentration at the source zone control plane cs t is governed by a power law model that reflects the relationship between the source strength and the source mass as follows falta et al 2005 parker and park 2004 1 c s t c 0 t c s t dt 0 c s t dt γ m s t m 0 γ where c 0 is the initial contaminant concentration at the source zone control plane ms t and m 0 are contaminant mass in the source zone and its initial value at t 0 respectively γ is an empirical parameter related to the heterogeneity of the flow field in the aquifer and the dnapl distribution in the layered sedimentary aquitards the governing equation for dissolved dnapl diffusion sorption and degradation can be given as zheng et al 2002 2 r d i c i z t t d i 2 c i z t z 2 λ i r d i c i z t i 1 2 3 m where ci z t ml 3 represents the contaminant

experiment involving bromide migration in a clay layer a continuously stirred tank reactor achieved three types of source depletion mode i e instantaneous linear and exponential source depletion and the parameters of these sources are presented in fig 2 solute bromide was loaded through the sand layer and then diffused to the adjacent clay layer teflon tape was applied to the clay boundary which was simplified to a zero flux lower border in the proposed analytical model the experiment measured the molecular diffusion coefficient d 0 tortuosity factors τ porosity n and retardation factor rd were 1 74 10 4 m2 d 0 2 0 6 and 1 respectively fig 2 compares the bromide concentration measured by the laboratory experiment with the present analytical solutions the coefficient of efficiency e yang et al 2016 was adopted to assess the goodness of fit between the measured and simulated data 42 e 1 0 j 1 n o i p i 2 j 1 n o i o 2 where p is the simulated result o is the measured data and o is the measured mean the closer the value of e to 1 0 indicates a better fit the results obtained by the two methods were in good agreement with mean e 0 93 for γ 0 fig 2a and γ 0 5 fig 2b and mean e 0 94 for γ 1 fig 2c 3 2 comparison with existing analytical solutions this part used existing analytical models for forward and back diffusion of nonreactive solute in a single aquitard to verify the proposed solutions here an instantaneous depletion source in the aquifer is considered together with two different lower boundary conditions i e zero flux boundary fig s1a and s1b in supplementary material and zero concentration boundary fig s1c and s1d for the zero flux lower boundary case the model height h and source release duration t 0 were 60 mm and 22 d respectively yang et al 2015 while for the zero concentration lower boundary case h 20 mm and t 0 13 d yang et al 2017 the remaining parameters of both scenarios above were the same the molecular diffusion coefficient of solute d 0 was 1 74 10 4 m2 d the tortuosity factors τ and porosity n of the aquitard were 0 15 and 0 6 respectively and the retardation factor rd was set as 1 the concentration profiles in fig s1 show that the current solutions are in good agreement with the existing analytical solutions during the forward and back diffusion indicating the present model performs well in characterizing contaminant accumulation and discharge from low permeability sediments 3 3 comparison with layered numerical models a layered numerical model was built by the finite element software comsol multiphysics 5 6 to verify the correctness of the proposed multi layer model the model consisted of a silt clay loam layer a silt loam layer and a clay layer from top to bottom and the thickness of each layer was 0 3 m the material parameters of these three low permeability soils are given in table s1 the release parameters of sources were t 0 5 years for the instantaneous source depletion κ 0 1 year 1 for the linear source depletion and λs 0 2 year 1 for the exponential source depletion the initial concentration of source zone c 0 was set to be 1 mg l and the neumann lower boundary condition was adopted fig 3 shows a good consistency between the present solutions and the numerical results in terms of the concentration profiles as for the flux in the time domain the mass flux at the aquifer aquitard interface calculated by the analytical solution also agrees well with the corresponding numerical results table s2 with a relative error of less than 5 for both large and small times as well as the scenarios where reaction term dominates i e larger damköhler number thus the feasibility and accuracy of the developed solutions have been demonstrated and these will be used as follows to provide insight into the forward and back diffusion behavior of contaminants in the multi layer low permeability sediments 4 results and discussion the triple layer model mentioned in section 3 3 was chosen as a base case for the following analysis if not specified the material parameters of low permeability soil were given in table s1 and the contaminant source parameters were described in section 3 3 4 1 source depletion mode the variation of contaminant fluxes at the aquifer aquitard interface fig 4 a presents three stages of mass exchange between high and low permeability zones the first stage is the forward diffusion i e mass flux j a a 0 in fig 4a in which contaminants diffuse from the overlying aquifer into aquitards driven by down concentration gradients leading to a gradual accumulation of pollutants in the sedimentary aquitards fig 4b the second is the flux equilibrium stage i e j a a 0 when the mass exchange between the aquifer and aquitards is in dynamic balance and the contaminant accumulation values reach a maximum hollow circle in fig 4b the third is the back diffusion stage i e j a a 0 the contaminants would migrate from aquitards into the overlying aquifer resulting in a slow reduction in mass storage fig 4b fig 4 also demonstrates that the depletion pattern of the same mass source significantly affects the three stage mass exchange described above the instantaneous source depletion case had the maximum mass flux j a a during the forward diffusion period indicating that contaminants diffuse into the low permeability sediments fastest fig 4a meanwhile this scenario also had the maximum cumulative mass storage cms 0 22 g m2 in fig 4b and the earliest time of flux equilibrium t fe 5 years in fig 4b these indicated that more rapid dissolution of the dnapl source could facilitate storage of contaminants in the aquitards and advance the onset of back diffusion in the exponential source depletion case the back diffusion occurred later 7 8 years and the maximum cms of 0 11 g m2 was only about half that of the instantaneous source depletion case interestingly yang et al 2016 showed that the exponential source depletion case had a minimum back diffusion onset time among the three source depletion cases the difference between the results of the present study and the previous study by yang et al 2016 could be due to soil heterogeneity section 4 2 will provide more insight into the role of soil heterogeneity in the contaminant back diffusion behavior theoretical and experimental studies suggested that an exponential depletion mode with continuously varying concentrations in eq 39 was more appropriate to describe dnapl source dissolution chen and jawitz 2009 newell et al 2006 zhu and sykes 2004 hence it is used for the following parametric analysis soil heterogeneity degradation reaction and boundary condition 4 2 soil heterogeneity predicting heavily contaminated spots in low permeability soils is essential for reasonable remediation proposals you et al 2020 a single homogeneous aquitard system is generally used in the previous prediction model but it could not reflect the influence of aquitard heterogeneity on contaminant migration and mass exchange thus fig 5 b and c compare the layered aquitard model heterogeneous a and heterogeneous b in fig 5a with an equivalent homogeneous model ehm regarding the contaminant concentration profiles the ehm used averaged property values of the three soil layers in the heterogeneous a or heterogeneous b system and required material parameters are given in table s1 the contaminant concentrations predicted by the ehm were markedly different from those predicted by the two heterogeneous models at the forward fig 5b and back diffusion stage fig 5c indicating that the homogeneous model performed poorly in simulating stratified sediments the concentrations in the heterogeneous b were significantly lower than those in the heterogeneous a in the forward diffusion stage fig 5b which is attributed to the conversion of a considerable number of aqueous pollutants to the adsorbed state in the upper high retardation soil layer trichloroethylene tce was selected as the target pollutant with a screening value svtce of 0 005 mg l usepa 2009 and any subsurface location where tce concentration exceeds svtce is deemed polluted the heterogeneous b also had a relatively tiny penetration depth z p 0 07 m at t 4 years fig 5b which was only 17 of z p in the heterogeneous a this suggested that the upper high retardation soil in heterogeneous b could effectively prevent the penetration of contaminants at the back diffusion stage fig 5c the upper region of the heterogeneous a system had a lower concentration than that of the homogeneous and heterogeneous b systems because a more considerable amount of aqueous tce migrated from the upper low retardation layer of heterogeneous a to the underlying middle and high retardation layers during the back diffusion period as stated in section 4 1 the flux equilibrium was a critical moment of mass exchange between the aquifer and aquitard denoted as t fe when low permeability zones had the maximum cumulative mass storage cms max forming a secondary source of contamination fig 6 shows that the emh has the largest cms max 0 402 g m2 and the smallest t fe 4 5 years illustrating that an equivalent homogeneous model might overestimate the storage capacity of heterogeneous sediments and underestimate the start up time of back diffusion the t fe of 7 8 years for the heterogeneous a case indicated that the weakened adsorption of the upper aquitard and the enhanced adsorption of the lower aquitard could prolong the back diffusion onset to quantitatively analyze the effect of aquitard adsorption properties on the cms max and t fe continuous variation in retardation factors of the top middle and bottom aquitard denoted as rd 1 rd 2 and rd 3 respectively were investigated fig 7 the remaining parameters were consistent with the corresponding parameters of the heterogeneous a model with an increase in rd 1 the cms max grew approximately linearly while t fe decreased sharply and converged to a stable value fig 7a when the rd 1 3 the present layered model was required to predict the cms max and t fe more accurately this is because contaminants stored in the second layer e g z p 0 53 when rd 1 1 in fig 7b affected the back diffusion behavior of the overlying aquitard when the retardation factor of the top aquitard is larger rd 1 3 the contaminants were mainly stored in the top aquitard fig 7b thus resulting in its back diffusion behavior similar to that of a homogeneous aquitard thickness is 0 9 and material is the same as aquitard 1 as shown in fig 7a when rd 1 was fixed based case rd 1 1 4 the retardation factor of the middle aquitard rd 2 had a more slight effect on the cms max and t fe compared to rd 1 fig 7c for example the cms max increased from 0 11 g m2 to 0 22 g m2 as the rd 1 increased from 1 to 6 years but it merely enhanced by 0 0046 g m2 as the rd 2 increased from 10 to 30 years when rd 1 increases to 5 in fig 7c both cms max and t fe are almost independent of rd 2 since the top aquitard adsorbs most contaminants z p 0 41 m fig 7d shows that under the base case h 1 h 2 h 3 0 3 m the cms max and t fe are independent on the retardation factor of the bottom aquitard rd 3 because the bottom aquitard is almost free of contaminants at the start of back diffusion z p 0 49 m h 1 h 2 0 6 m when the thickness of the two overlying aquitards decreased h 1 h 2 0 1 m h 3 0 3 m the contaminants would diffuse into the bottom aquitard z p 0 27 m h 1 h 2 0 2 m resulting in rd 3 greatly affecting the storage capacity of aquitards and the onset time of back diffusion fig 7d the aquitard heterogeneity may also affect the reverse release rate of contaminants i e mass flux j a a and the cumulative mass discharge cmd during back diffusion fig 8 a shows that the equivalent homogeneous model ehm in fig 5a has the fastest back diffusion rate due to its maximum cumulative mass storage the back diffusion rate of heterogeneous a was the slowest resulting in only 34 of the contaminants migrating into the overlying aquifer much less than that of the homogeneous case fig 8b the overlying aquifer concentrations of three types of aquitard systems are presented in fig 9 using the superposition of flux average concentration cf and source concentration cs proposed by yang et al 2016 table s3 in supplementary material provides the specific expression of cf and the input parameters of the aquifer chapman and parker 2005 fig 9 shows that the ehm predicts a maximum aquifer concentration and the longest plume trailing time indicating that the back diffusion risk of heterogeneous aquitard may be overestimated in general it is necessary to pay close attention to the aquitard heterogeneity in predicting the concentration distribution mass storage flux equilibrium moment and cumulative mass discharge 4 3 degradation reaction the degradation reactions of organic pollutants in low permeability sediments have been confirmed in field tests using the compound specific isotope analysis gilevska et al 2021 rasa et al 2011 wanner et al 2018a 2018b this part used the based case heterogeneous a model to investigate the effect of degradation on maximum cumulative mass storage cms max and the flux equilibrium moment t fe as degradation half life t 1 2 decreased i e the degradation rate increased both the cms max and the t fe increased noticeably at t 1 2 100 years fig 10 for example a reduction in t 1 2 from 100 to 10 years increased cms max by 17 8 and t fe by about 80 therefore enhanced biodegradation in low permeability sediments allowed longer storage of more contaminants a promising treatment to mitigate aquifer contamination the low permeability sediments had a maximum back diffusion flux j a a when contaminants did not undergo degradation reactions t 1 2 in fig 11 a as the degradation half life t 1 2 decreased the peak flux j a a gradually decreased since stronger degradation reactions could rapidly consume more contaminants fig 11b provided the relationship between the relative mass discharge cmd cms max and the degradation half life t 1 2 when t 1 2 was less than 72 years only 30 of the contaminants were released into the aquifer after 100 years if the t 1 2 was limited to less than 16 years using biostimulation or bioaugmentation sayara et al 2011 the storage ratio of the aquitard would exceed 90 as a result this study recommends enhancing the biodegradation of polluted low permeability sediments in remediation efforts to prevent contaminant back diffusion into adjacent aquifers the proposed diffusion reaction coupled model is of great value and high demand in accessing the effectiveness of such bioremediation 4 4 lower boundary condition this section evaluated the role and importance of the lower boundary condition lbc on the back diffusion behavior as mentioned in the introduction a semi infinite lbc is generally used in previous studies the bottom of the low permeability sediments may be an active aquifer which can be modeled as a zero concentration boundary to reflect the flushing effect i e dirichlet lbc it may also be impermeable bedrock represented by a zero gradient boundary i e neumann lbc a homogeneous model with low retardation soil was adopted in this part and soil material is given in table s1 suppose the finite domain model with dirichlet lbc or neumann lbc is simplified to a semi infinite domain model in that case the predicted values of the j a a and cmd will be overestimated or underestimated as shown in fig 12 a and 12b for instance 81 of the contaminants migrated from the finite aquitards with neumann lbc into the adjacent aquifer over 100 years in contrast the semi infinite domain model predicted that only 66 of pollutants entered the aquifer fig 12b this prediction error might be unfavorable for subsequent groundwater remediation to quantitatively characterize the effects of lbc fig 13 a and 13b present the relative difference of cumulative mass discharge cmd between a finite domain model with dirichlet lbc and a semi infinite domain model denoted as δ d s cmd dirichlet cmd semi inf cmd dirichlet and between a finite domain model with neumann lbc and a semi infinite domain model denoted as δ n s cmd neumann cmd semi inf cmd neumann respectively a larger value of δ refers to a more significant difference using a criterion of δ 5 denoted here as a critical error line fig 13 can be divided into a strong impact zone on the lower right side δ 5 and a weak impact zone on the upper left side δ 5 the semi infinite domain model is considered to give a poor estimation for the strong impact zone case hence a thin aquitard could not be simplified to a semi infinite domain model especially when predicting the long term back diffusion behavior fig 13 as the aquitard retardation factor increased the critical error line of δ n s 5 shifted downward resulting in a smaller area of the strong impact zone fig 14 a conversely a larger degradation half life a slower degradation rate would produce a more extensive strong impact zone fig 14b similar variations for the critical error line of δ d s 5 were given in fig s2 of supplementary material the above results implied that the semi infinite domain model is more feasible for high adsorption and strong degradation aquitard systems 5 limitations and perspectives this work attempts to develop a simple analytical solution for rapidly evaluating the risk of back diffusion from multi layer low permeability sediments several simplifications were made which raised some limitations reactive solutes such as chlorinated solvents and pesticides are expected to undergo sequential degradation and the daughter products also pose a threat to the environment chambon et al 2010 due to the solution complexity this work did not consider the related multispecies transport in the heterogeneous media the monod kinetics chambon et al 2013 that describe this sequential degradation are to be coupled with the present model in the future to predict the back diffusion behavior of daughter products in low permeability sediments moreover the competition of daughter products for adsorption sites on the soil particle surface could reduce the sorption capacity of each species this implies that the present model would overestimate the storage mass of a single species in the sediments and underestimate its back diffusion onset time see fig 7 another limitation is that the proposed model considered one dimensional diffusion without advection solute transport in the low permeability sediments may be dominated by diffusion or reaction but slow advection may still have a non negligible effect on mass storage and release forward advection i e water flows in the same direction as forward diffusion should result in more contaminants entering the sediments the role of aquitard advection in the adjacent aquifer plume needs further study in the future furthermore the present analytical model cannot portray the real three dimensional spatiotemporal characteristics of contaminant transport but it may provide a conservative assessment of site risk 6 conclusion a novel analytical solution was proposed to investigate reactive contaminants forward and back diffusion through multi layer low permeability zones this model coupled the dynamic depletion of dnapl source and contaminant diffusion sorption degradation processes presenting three stages of mass exchange between aquitards and adjacent aquifers the duhamel theorem and the transfer matrix method were adopted to derive the exact solution for the transient multi layer problem which was verified against existing analytical solutions numerical results and experimental data specific solutions for three archetypical source depletion patterns were presented and they were then used to examine the influences of the source strength function aquitard heterogeneity contaminant degradation reactions and boundary conditions some major conclusions were drawn as follows 1 source depletion patterns are essential in the solute exchange between the low and high permeability zones more rapid depletion of a dnapl source in a high permeability aquifer would facilitate the storage of contaminants in the layered low permeability sediments and accelerate the onset of back diffusion 2 equivalent homogeneous models would overestimate the storage capacity of heterogeneous sediments and the plume persistence in the overlying aquifer but underestimate the onset time of back diffusion the stronger adsorption of the top sediment in a heterogenous aquitard system might result in more stored contaminants and earlier onset of back diffusion however the onset of back diffusion of a homogeneous aquitard system was independent of the sediment sorption 3 when the degradation half life t 1 2 100 years the diffusion reaction coupled model proposed in this study is required to assess the potential risk of aquitard back diffusion a smaller t 1 2 faster degradation rate resulted in lower reverse release rates and less mass emissions from aquitards for example less than 10 of contaminants diffused from the aquitards into the overlying aquifer when t 1 2 16 years therefore enhancing degradation in aquitards is an effective measure to mitigate the back diffusion risk 4 the assumption of a semi infinite lower boundary is not applicable when predicting the long term back diffusion behavior of a thin aquitard system see the strong impact zone in fig 13 the assumption would result in a maximum error of over 200 in the predicted cumulative mass discharge in addition aquitards with stronger degradation reaction and adsorption would produce a smaller strong impact zone implying enhanced applicability of semi infinite domain models declaration of competing interest we declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that

15678,contaminants stored in the low permeability sediments will continue to threaten the adjacent shallow groundwater system after the aquifer is remediated understanding the storage and discharge behavior of contaminants in the aquitards is essential for the efficient remediation of contaminated sites but most of the previous analytical studies focused on nonreactive solutes in a single homogenous aquitard this study presents novel analytical solutions for the forward and back diffusion of contaminants through multi layer low permeability sediments considering abiotic and biotic environmental degradation three representative source depletion patterns i e instantaneous linear and exponential patterns were selected to describe the dissolution of dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl in the aquifer more realistically at the forward diffusion stage the mass storage of contaminants in the aquitards with the instantaneous pattern is the largest nearly twice that with the exponential pattern a simple equivalent homogeneous model is generally adopted in the risk assessment however relative to the proposed multi layer model it will significantly underestimate the onset of the back diffusion of heterogeneous aquitards and overestimate the persistence of aquifer plumes the previously reported semi infinite boundary assumption is also not applicable with a maximum error of over 200 in the long term prediction of back diffusion behavior of a thin aquitard moreover when the degradation half life is less than 16 years less than 10 of the contaminants stored in the aquitards will diffuse into the overlying aquifer suggesting that biostimulation or bioaugmentation can effectively mitigate back diffusion risk overall the proposed diffusion reaction coupled model with multi layer media is of great value and high demand in predicting the back diffusion behavior of heterogeneous aquitards and guiding the soil bioremediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords back diffusion layered aquitards degradation reaction dnapl source depletion analytical solution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater contamination induced by industrial and agricultural activities poses potential threats to human health and ecosystems and thus the restoration of contaminated aquifers has attracted extensive attention however long term storage and slow release of contaminants in the underlying low permeability sediments aquitards severely hinder aquifer remediation yan et al 2016 specifically aquifer contaminants migrate from the source zone into aquitards driven by concentration gradients accumulating pollutants in the low permeability zones termed as forward diffusion when the contaminant source is depleted or isolated the aquifer concentrations decline and then the concentration gradient at the aquifer aquitard interface reverses after that the aquitards will act as a secondary source to release pollutants into the overlying aquifer creating a long term plume termed as back diffusion therefore the study on the forward and back diffusion through low permeability sediments is of great significance for the control and remediation of groundwater contamination you et al 2020 a series of field and laboratory scale experiments ball et al 1997 chapman and parker 2005 parker et al 2008 sale et al 2008 tatti et al 2018 wanner et al 2018a wilking et al 2013 yang et al 2015 have been conducted to observe and confirm the phenomena of solute exchange between high and low permeability media however these low permeability experiments are generally expensive and time consuming since diffusion dominated solute migration is considerably slow in addition it is also challenging to install measurement probes that do not disturb the soil in laboratory tests li et al 2021 and in regular site assessment the drilling cores are usually prohibitive chapman and parker 2005 parker et al 2004 as a result various numerical models chambon et al 2010 chapman et al 2012 parker et al 2008 wanner et al 2018a and analytical models brown et al 2012 ding and feng 2022 yang et al 2015 have been developed to extend and complement the limited experimental research numerical models can account for many complex scenarios such as irregularly shaped low permeability zones chapman et al 2012 and multispecies migration with competitive adsorption and degradation chambon et al 2010 however they are not generally adopted in regulatory contexts for site risk assessments due to extensive data collection requirements and high learning costs chambon et al 2011 analytical solutions require some simplifications but they were found to be quite valuable in 1 serving as screening tools to efficiently obtain the order of magnitude estimates chambon et al 2011 2 revealing the basic mechanisms of solute transport you et al 2020 and 3 providing benchmarks for numerical models ding et al 2021 based on fick s second law of diffusion parker et al 2004 proposed a one dimensional analytical model for forward and back diffusion of a contaminant in a semi infinite aquitard in which the predicted aqueous trichloroethylene concentrations were in good agreement with the field test results yang et al 2015 extended this model to a finite domain using the method of images brown et al 2012 and yang et al 2016 introduced a source mass depletion model to the back diffusion model and discussed the effect of source dissolution behavior on aquitard mass accumulation and discharge chambon et al 2011 developed a risk assessment tool for contaminant transport through low permeability fractured media by modifying the analytical solutions of tang et al 1981 they suggested that back diffusion from the matrix to the fracture system may result in a long term risk to adjacent aquifers however these prediction models are only applicable to a single low permeability layer layered low permeability sediments have been commonly observed in coastal and lakeside areas cherry et al 2004 gao and liu 2022 hendry et al 2011 xu et al 2009 due to natural deposition and consolidation fortunately ball et al 1997 and liu and ball 1998 developed an analytical solution for forward and back diffusion of nonreactive solute through a two layer porous medium however some limitations remain first this two layer model has limited applicability and cannot be generalized to any number of aquitards second an infinite depth lower boundary is inappropriate because the thickness of the low permeability sediments in practice is finite third the model ignored degradation reaction one of the main control mechanisms for contaminant transport in sediments gilevska et al 2021 wanner et al 2018b the long term importance of abiotic or biotic degradation for back diffusion has also been experimentally demonstrated damgaard et al 2013 schaefer et al 2018 wanner et al 2016 the reasonability of the above three hypotheses remains questionable and their effects on the accumulation and reverse release of contaminants through layered sedimentary aquitards should be extensively explored several researchers have proposed analytical solutions to the diffusion hickson et al 2009 trefry and whyte 1999 xie et al 2015 or advection dispersion equations feng et al 2019 guerrero et al 2013 shen and reible 2015 in multi layer porous media for example hickson et al 2009 found an exact solution to a multi layer diffusion problem using the separation of variables method their results illustrated that the time taken to heat transport depends significantly on the order of layered media these analytical studies all assumed a steady state inlet boundary condition that cannot characterize the source depletion dynamics recently carr and march 2018 developed a semi analytical approach for solving multi layer diffusion problems with a time dependent boundary condition zimmerman et al 2016 presented a semi analytical solution to axisymmetric diffusion reaction equations with continuous transient boundary conditions using laplace transform technique nevertheless these semi analytical methods failed to derive exact closed form solutions as they require numerical inversion of the laplace transform the main objectives of this study are to 1 develop novel analytical solutions capable of describing the forward and back diffusion of reactive solutes through stratified sedimentary aquitards 2 investigate the effects of source mass depletion patterns sediment heterogeneity and degradation reaction on contaminant accumulation and release 3 quantitatively characterize the differences between finite domain and semi infinite domain prediction models and 4 provide remediation recommendations for the contaminated sites with back diffusion risks 2 mathematical model 2 1 governing equations and boundary conditions fig 1 depicts the release of dissolved phase contaminants from the dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl source zone and their mass exchange between the high permeability aquifer and the low permeability aquitards the model begins with horizontal movement of groundwater flow across the dnapl source zone creating a dissolved contaminant plume in the aquifer the aqueous phase contaminants then diffuse from the aquifer into the underlying multi layer aquitards under a downward concentration gradient i e forward diffusion as the dnapl source mass is depleted the aquitards will transform from sinks to sources and release contaminants into the overlying aquifer i e back diffusion to facilitate the development of the forward and back diffusion model the following assumptions were adopted 1 each layer of the sedimentary aquitard system was assumed as homogeneous and isotropic cherry et al 2004 2 the power law function was used to describe dnapl source depletion in the subsurface aquifer falta et al 2005 parker and park 2004 3 one dimensional diffusion along the z direction was considered in low permeability zones while advection was negligible brown et al 2012 yang et al 2015 4 a single reactive species was considered without considering degradation daughter products chambon et al 2011 5 degradation reactions obeyed first order kinetics wanner et al 2018b 6 sorption process was assumed to be linear instantaneous and reversible ding et al 2020 7 material properties of aquifers and aquitards remained invariable over time in the high permeability aquifer the dissolved dnapl concentration at the source zone control plane cs t is governed by a power law model that reflects the relationship between the source strength and the source mass as follows falta et al 2005 parker and park 2004 1 c s t c 0 t c s t dt 0 c s t dt γ m s t m 0 γ where c 0 is the initial contaminant concentration at the source zone control plane ms t and m 0 are contaminant mass in the source zone and its initial value

dissolved dnapl diffusion sorption and degradation can be given as zheng et al 2002 2 r d i c i z t t d i 2 c i z t z 2 λ i r d i c i z t i 1 2 3 m where ci z t ml 3 represents the contaminant

experiment involving bromide migration in a clay layer a continuously stirred tank reactor achieved three types of source depletion mode i e instantaneous linear and exponential source depletion and the parameters of these sources are presented in fig 2 solute bromide was loaded through the sand layer and then diffused to the adjacent clay layer teflon tape was applied to the clay boundary which was simplified to a zero flux lower border in the proposed analytical model the experiment measured the molecular diffusion coefficient d 0 tortuosity factors τ porosity n and retardation factor rd were 1 74 10 4 m2 d 0 2 0 6 and 1 respectively fig 2 compares the bromide concentration measured by the laboratory experiment with the present analytical solutions the coefficient of efficiency e yang et al 2016 was adopted to assess the goodness of fit between the measured and simulated data 42 e 1 0 j 1 n o i p i 2 j 1 n o i o 2 where p is the simulated result o is the measured data and o is the measured mean the closer the value of e to 1 0 indicates a better fit the results obtained by the two methods were in good agreement with mean e 0 93 for γ 0 fig 2a and γ 0 5 fig 2b and mean e 0 94 for γ 1 fig 2c 3 2 comparison with existing analytical solutions this part used existing analytical models for forward and back diffusion of nonreactive solute in a single aquitard to verify the proposed solutions here an instantaneous depletion source in the aquifer is considered together with two different lower boundary conditions i e zero flux boundary fig s1a and s1b in supplementary material and zero concentration boundary fig s1c and s1d for the zero flux lower boundary case the model height h and source release duration t 0 were 60 mm and 22 d respectively yang et al 2015 while for the zero concentration lower boundary case h 20 mm and t 0 13 d yang et al 2017 the remaining parameters of both scenarios above were the same the molecular diffusion coefficient of solute d 0 was 1 74 10 4 m2 d the tortuosity factors τ and porosity n of the aquitard were 0 15 and 0 6 respectively and the retardation factor rd was set as 1 the concentration profiles in fig s1 show that the current solutions are in good agreement with the existing analytical solutions during the forward and back diffusion indicating the present model performs well in characterizing contaminant accumulation and discharge from low permeability sediments 3 3 comparison with layered numerical models a layered numerical model was built by the finite element software comsol multiphysics 5 6 to verify the correctness of the proposed multi layer model the model consisted of a silt clay loam layer a silt loam layer and a clay layer from top to bottom and the thickness of each layer was 0 3 m the material parameters of these three low permeability soils are given in table s1 the release parameters of sources were t 0 5 years for the instantaneous source depletion κ 0 1 year 1 for the linear source depletion and λs 0 2 year 1 for the exponential source depletion the initial concentration of source zone c 0 was set to be 1 mg l and the neumann lower boundary condition was adopted fig 3 shows a good consistency between the present solutions and the numerical results in terms of the concentration profiles as for the flux in the time domain the mass flux at the aquifer aquitard interface calculated by the analytical solution also agrees well with the corresponding numerical results table s2 with a relative error of less than 5 for both large and small times as well as the scenarios where reaction term dominates i e larger damköhler number thus the feasibility and accuracy of the developed solutions have been demonstrated and these will be used as follows to provide insight into the forward and back diffusion behavior of contaminants in the multi layer low permeability sediments 4 results and discussion the triple layer model mentioned in section 3 3 was chosen as a base case for the following analysis if not specified the material parameters of low permeability soil were given in table s1 and the contaminant source parameters were described in section 3 3 4 1 source depletion mode the variation of contaminant fluxes at the aquifer aquitard interface fig 4 a presents three stages of mass exchange between high and low permeability zones the first stage is the forward diffusion i e mass flux j a a 0 in fig 4a in which contaminants diffuse from the overlying aquifer into aquitards driven by down concentration gradients leading to a gradual accumulation of pollutants in the sedimentary aquitards fig 4b the second is the flux equilibrium stage i e j a a 0 when the mass exchange between the aquifer and aquitards is in dynamic balance and the contaminant accumulation values reach a maximum hollow circle in fig 4b the third is the back diffusion stage i e j a a 0 the contaminants would migrate from aquitards into the overlying aquifer resulting in a slow reduction in mass storage fig 4b fig 4 also demonstrates that the depletion pattern of the same mass source significantly affects the three stage mass exchange described above the instantaneous source depletion case had the maximum mass flux j a a during the forward diffusion period indicating that contaminants diffuse into the low permeability sediments fastest fig 4a meanwhile this scenario also had the maximum cumulative mass storage cms 0 22 g m2 in fig 4b and the earliest time of flux equilibrium t fe 5 years in fig 4b these indicated that more rapid dissolution of the dnapl source could facilitate storage of contaminants in the aquitards and advance the onset of back diffusion in the exponential source depletion case the back diffusion occurred later 7 8 years and the maximum cms of 0 11 g m2 was only about half that of the instantaneous source depletion case interestingly yang et al 2016 showed that the exponential source depletion case had a minimum back diffusion onset time among the three source depletion cases the difference between the results of the present study and the previous study by yang et al 2016 could be due to soil heterogeneity section 4 2 will provide more insight into the role of soil heterogeneity in the contaminant back diffusion behavior theoretical and experimental studies suggested that an exponential depletion mode with continuously varying concentrations in eq 39 was more appropriate to describe dnapl source dissolution chen and jawitz 2009 newell et al 2006 zhu and sykes 2004 hence it is used for the following parametric analysis soil heterogeneity degradation reaction and boundary condition 4 2 soil heterogeneity predicting heavily contaminated spots in low permeability soils is essential for reasonable remediation proposals you et al 2020 a single homogeneous aquitard system is generally used in the previous prediction model but it could not reflect the influence of aquitard heterogeneity on contaminant migration and mass exchange thus fig 5 b and c compare the layered aquitard model heterogeneous a and heterogeneous b in fig 5a with an equivalent homogeneous model ehm regarding the contaminant concentration profiles the ehm used averaged property values of the three soil layers in the heterogeneous a or heterogeneous b system and required material parameters are given in table s1 the contaminant concentrations predicted by the ehm were markedly different from those predicted by the two heterogeneous models at the forward fig 5b and back diffusion stage fig 5c indicating that the homogeneous model performed poorly in simulating stratified sediments the concentrations in the heterogeneous b were significantly lower than those in the heterogeneous a in the forward diffusion stage fig 5b which is attributed to the conversion of a considerable number of aqueous pollutants to the adsorbed state in the upper high retardation soil layer trichloroethylene tce was selected as the target pollutant with a screening value svtce of 0 005 mg l usepa 2009 and any subsurface location where tce concentration exceeds svtce is deemed polluted the heterogeneous b also had a relatively tiny penetration depth z p 0 07 m at t 4 years fig 5b which was only 17 of z p in the heterogeneous a this suggested that the upper high retardation soil in heterogeneous b could effectively prevent the penetration of contaminants at the back diffusion stage fig 5c the upper region of the heterogeneous a system had a lower concentration than that of the homogeneous and heterogeneous b systems because a more considerable amount of aqueous tce migrated from the upper low retardation layer of heterogeneous a to the underlying middle and high retardation layers during the back diffusion period as stated in section 4 1 the flux equilibrium was a critical moment of mass exchange between the aquifer and aquitard denoted as t fe when low permeability zones had the maximum cumulative mass storage cms max forming a secondary source of contamination fig 6 shows that the emh has the largest cms max 0 402 g m2 and the smallest t fe 4 5 years illustrating that an equivalent homogeneous model might overestimate the storage capacity of heterogeneous sediments and underestimate the start up time of back diffusion the t fe of 7 8 years for the heterogeneous a case indicated that the weakened adsorption of the upper aquitard and the enhanced adsorption of the lower aquitard could prolong the back diffusion onset to quantitatively analyze the effect of aquitard adsorption properties on the cms max and t fe continuous variation in retardation factors of the top middle and bottom aquitard denoted as rd 1 rd 2 and rd 3 respectively were investigated fig 7 the remaining parameters were consistent with the corresponding parameters of the heterogeneous a model with an increase in rd 1 the cms max grew approximately linearly while t fe decreased sharply and converged to a stable value fig 7a when the rd 1 3 the present layered model was required to predict the cms max and t fe more accurately this is because contaminants stored in the second layer e g z p 0 53 when rd 1 1 in fig 7b affected the back diffusion behavior of the overlying aquitard when the retardation factor of the top aquitard is larger rd 1 3 the contaminants were mainly stored in the top aquitard fig 7b thus resulting in its back diffusion behavior similar to that of a homogeneous aquitard thickness is 0 9 and material is the same as aquitard 1 as shown in fig 7a when rd 1 was fixed based case rd 1 1 4 the retardation factor of the middle aquitard rd 2 had a more slight effect on the cms max and t fe compared to rd 1 fig 7c for example the cms max increased from 0 11 g m2 to 0 22 g m2 as the rd 1 increased from 1 to 6 years but it merely enhanced by 0 0046 g m2 as the rd 2 increased from 10 to 30 years when rd 1 increases to 5 in fig 7c both cms max and t fe are almost independent of rd 2 since the top aquitard adsorbs most contaminants z p 0 41 m fig 7d shows that under the base case h 1 h 2 h 3 0 3 m the cms max and t fe are independent on the retardation factor of the bottom aquitard rd 3 because the bottom aquitard is almost free of contaminants at the start of back diffusion z p 0 49 m h 1 h 2 0 6 m when the thickness of the two overlying aquitards decreased h 1 h 2 0 1 m h 3 0 3 m the contaminants would diffuse into the bottom aquitard z p 0 27 m h 1 h 2 0 2 m resulting in rd 3 greatly affecting the storage capacity of aquitards and the onset time of back diffusion fig 7d the aquitard heterogeneity may also affect the reverse release rate of contaminants i e mass flux j a a and the cumulative mass discharge cmd during back diffusion fig 8 a shows that the equivalent homogeneous model ehm in fig 5a has the fastest back diffusion rate due to its maximum cumulative mass storage the back diffusion rate of heterogeneous a was the slowest resulting in only 34 of the contaminants migrating into the overlying aquifer much less than that of the homogeneous case fig 8b the overlying aquifer concentrations of three types of aquitard systems are presented in fig 9 using the superposition of flux average concentration cf and source concentration cs proposed by yang et al 2016 table s3 in supplementary material provides the specific expression of cf and the input parameters of the aquifer chapman and parker 2005 fig 9 shows that the ehm predicts a maximum aquifer concentration and the longest plume trailing time indicating that the back diffusion risk of heterogeneous aquitard may be overestimated in general it is necessary to pay close attention to the aquitard heterogeneity in predicting the concentration distribution mass storage flux equilibrium moment and cumulative mass discharge 4 3 degradation reaction the degradation reactions of organic pollutants in low permeability sediments have been confirmed in field tests using the compound specific isotope analysis gilevska et al 2021 rasa et al 2011 wanner et al 2018a 2018b this part used the based case heterogeneous a model to investigate the effect of degradation on maximum cumulative mass storage cms max and the flux equilibrium moment t fe as degradation half life t 1 2 decreased i e the degradation rate increased both the cms max and the t fe increased noticeably at t 1 2 100 years fig 10 for example a reduction in t 1 2 from 100 to 10 years increased cms max by 17 8 and t fe by about 80 therefore enhanced biodegradation in low permeability sediments allowed longer storage of more contaminants a promising treatment to mitigate aquifer contamination the low permeability sediments had a maximum back diffusion flux j a a when contaminants did not undergo degradation reactions t 1 2 in fig 11 a as the degradation half life t 1 2 decreased the peak flux j a a gradually decreased since stronger degradation reactions could rapidly consume more contaminants fig 11b provided the relationship between the relative mass discharge cmd cms max and the degradation half life t 1 2 when t 1 2 was less than 72 years only 30 of the contaminants were released into the aquifer after 100 years if the t 1 2 was limited to less than 16 years using biostimulation or bioaugmentation sayara et al 2011 the storage ratio of the aquitard would exceed 90 as a result this study recommends enhancing the biodegradation of polluted low permeability sediments in remediation efforts to prevent contaminant back diffusion into adjacent aquifers the proposed diffusion reaction coupled model is of great value and high demand in accessing the effectiveness of such bioremediation 4 4 lower boundary condition this section evaluated the role and importance of the lower boundary condition lbc on the back diffusion behavior as mentioned in the introduction a semi infinite lbc is generally used in previous studies the bottom of the low permeability sediments may be an active aquifer which can be modeled as a zero concentration boundary to reflect the flushing effect i e dirichlet lbc it may also be impermeable bedrock represented by a zero gradient boundary i e neumann lbc a homogeneous model with low retardation soil was adopted in this part and soil material is given in table s1 suppose the finite domain model with dirichlet lbc or neumann lbc is simplified to a semi infinite domain model in that case the predicted values of the j a a and cmd will be overestimated or underestimated as shown in fig 12 a and 12b for instance 81 of the contaminants migrated from the finite aquitards with neumann lbc into the adjacent aquifer over 100 years in contrast the semi infinite domain model predicted that only 66 of pollutants entered the aquifer fig 12b this prediction error might be unfavorable for subsequent groundwater remediation to quantitatively characterize the effects of lbc fig 13 a and 13b present the relative difference of cumulative mass discharge cmd between a finite domain model with dirichlet lbc and a semi infinite domain model denoted as δ d s cmd dirichlet cmd semi inf cmd dirichlet and between a finite domain model with neumann lbc and a semi infinite domain model denoted as δ n s cmd neumann cmd semi inf cmd neumann respectively a larger value of δ refers to a more significant difference using a criterion of δ 5 denoted here as a critical error line fig 13 can be divided into a strong impact zone on the lower right side δ 5 and a weak impact zone on the upper left side δ 5 the semi infinite domain model is considered to give a poor estimation for the strong impact zone case hence a thin aquitard could not be simplified to a semi infinite domain model especially when predicting the long term back diffusion behavior fig 13 as the aquitard retardation factor increased the critical error line of δ n s 5 shifted downward resulting in a smaller area of the strong impact zone fig 14 a conversely a larger degradation half life a slower degradation rate would produce a more extensive strong impact zone fig 14b similar variations for the critical error line of δ d s 5 were given in fig s2 of supplementary material the above results implied that the semi infinite domain model is more feasible for high adsorption and strong degradation aquitard systems 5 limitations and perspectives this work attempts to develop a simple analytical solution for rapidly evaluating the risk of back diffusion from multi layer low permeability sediments several simplifications were made which raised some limitations reactive solutes such as chlorinated solvents and pesticides are expected to undergo sequential degradation and the daughter products also pose a threat to the environment chambon et al 2010 due to the solution complexity this work did not consider the related multispecies transport in the heterogeneous media the monod kinetics chambon et al 2013 that describe this sequential degradation are to be coupled with the present model in the future to predict the back diffusion behavior of daughter products in low permeability sediments moreover the competition of daughter products for adsorption sites on the soil particle surface could reduce the sorption capacity of each species this implies that the present model would overestimate the storage mass of a single species in the sediments and underestimate its back diffusion onset time see fig 7 another limitation is that the proposed model considered one dimensional diffusion without advection solute transport in the low permeability sediments may be dominated by diffusion or reaction but slow advection may still have a non negligible effect on mass storage and release forward advection i e water flows in the same direction as forward diffusion should result in more contaminants entering the sediments the role of aquitard advection in the adjacent aquifer plume needs further study in the future furthermore the present analytical model cannot portray the real three dimensional spatiotemporal characteristics of contaminant transport but it may provide a conservative assessment of site risk 6 conclusion a novel analytical solution was proposed to investigate reactive contaminants forward and back diffusion through multi layer low permeability zones this model coupled the dynamic depletion of dnapl source and contaminant diffusion sorption degradation processes presenting three stages of mass exchange between aquitards and adjacent aquifers the duhamel theorem and the transfer matrix method were adopted to derive the exact solution for the transient multi layer problem which was verified against existing analytical solutions numerical results and experimental data specific solutions for three archetypical source depletion patterns were presented and they were then used to examine the influences of the source strength function aquitard heterogeneity contaminant degradation reactions and boundary conditions some major conclusions were drawn as follows 1 source depletion patterns are essential in the solute exchange between the low and high permeability zones more rapid depletion of a dnapl source in a high permeability aquifer would facilitate the storage of contaminants in the layered low permeability sediments and accelerate the onset of back diffusion 2 equivalent homogeneous models would overestimate the storage capacity of heterogeneous sediments and the plume persistence in the overlying aquifer but underestimate the onset time of back diffusion the stronger adsorption of the top sediment in a heterogenous aquitard system might result in more stored contaminants and earlier onset of back diffusion however the onset of back diffusion of a homogeneous aquitard system was independent of the sediment sorption 3 when the degradation half life t 1 2 100 years the diffusion reaction coupled model proposed in this study is required to assess the potential risk of aquitard back diffusion a smaller t 1 2 faster degradation rate resulted in lower reverse release rates and less mass emissions from aquitards for example less than 10 of contaminants diffused from the aquitards into the overlying aquifer when t 1 2 16 years therefore enhancing degradation in aquitards is an effective measure to mitigate the back diffusion risk 4 the assumption of a semi infinite lower boundary is not applicable when predicting the long term back diffusion behavior of a thin aquitard system see the strong impact zone in fig 13 the assumption would result in a maximum error of over 200 in the predicted cumulative mass discharge in addition aquitards with stronger degradation reaction and adsorption would produce a smaller strong impact zone implying enhanced applicability of semi infinite domain models declaration of competing interest we declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that

15679,capacitive deionization cdi has been widely studied as a highly efficient method for the removal of charged pollutants in sewage however the control of ion selectivity has always been challenging limiting the application of this approach in this article the regulation of different acid base functional group distributions on the selectivity of four anions are comprehensively discussed the effects are quantified through simulations and statistical analysis finally optimized cdi is used for the simultaneous denitrification and dephosphorization of municipal wastewater the results show that carboxyl groups significantly promote the selectivity of dihydrogen phosphate and that amino groups promote the selectivity of sulfate and dihydrogen phosphate density functional theory is used to calculate the influence of the functional groups on the anion adsorption energy compared with other anions the energy released is improved when carboxyl groups are included in the adsorption of dihydrogen phosphate the increase in the released energy is highest when amino groups participate in the adsorption of sulfate and is second highest when they participate in the adsorption of dihydrogen phosphate statistical analysis shows that the valence and hydration energy of the anion and the effect of the functional groups on anion adsorption are significantly related to anion adsorption p 0 05 and the correlation coefficient of the model is 0 7253 a cdi stack for the removal of phosphorus and nitrogen under high background ion concentrations is constructed and applied and it is shown that the treated wastewater meets higher discharge standards moreover the method reaches nearly 80 water production under optimized operating modes this study reveals the importance of functional groups in ion selective regulation and provides a potential method for high standard wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords capacitive deionization cdi anions functional group selectivity data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is a novel water treatment method that can effectively remove charged pollutants from water wang et al 2022b liang et al 2022 during cdi the electric field induces anions and cations to move to the two poles and the ions form and are stored in an electric double layer edl at the solid liquid interface sli returning to solution via a short circuit fan et al 2017 ying et al 2002 since a voltage of 1 23 v is required for water electrolysis a voltage of 1 2 v is usually used in cdi in order to avoid the faraday reaction liang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 a low voltage is used as the core driving force during operation enabling cdi to save energy and prevent secondary pollution due to these advantages this technology has attracted extensive research attention wang et al 2022a biesheuvel et al 2011 chaleawlert umpon 2020 huyskens et al 2013 liu et al 2019 mohamed et al 2021 porada et al 2013 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2020 in related studies that have been reported to date improving the total electrosorption capacity through the optimization of electrode materials has been widely discussed ding et al 2022 wang et al 2022c khalil et al 2020 liu et al 2015 park and kwak 2014 ratajczak et al 2019 shih et al 2019 su et al 2020 tian et al 2020 xu et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 however wastewater that needs to be treated usually contains a variety of coexisting ions therefore it is unwise to consider only the high adsorption capacity and ignore the ion selectivity of cdi such an approach will limit the application of cdi in actual wastewater treatment because it is often unnecessary to remove all ions in the treatment process an increasing number of researchers have begun to realize the importance of selectivity and have focused on the exploration and improvement of the selectivity of cdi electrodes avraham et al 2008 eliad et al 2001 gabelich et al 2002 gamaethiralalage et al 2021 huang and su 2010 to date a relatively unified understanding of the mechanism of cdi ion selectivity has been obtained many studies have shown that material properties such as pore structure and ion properties such as ion valence and hydration energy affect selectivity hou and huang 2013 mossad et al 2013 for example we previously studied the competitive adsorption of four anions chloride nitrate dihydrogen phosphate and sulfate deng et al 2021 due to the difference in valence and hydration energy the order of adsorption on the carbon electrode was nitrate chloride sulfate dihydrogen phosphate the preferential adsorption of nitrate was attributed to its easy desolvation due to its high hydration energy the selectivity of dihydrogen phosphate was the weakest due to its lower hydration energy and lower electronegativity so that its adsorption is favored neither by its charge advantage nor by its desolvation behavior based on these selectivity mechanisms researchers have achieved specific partial ion adsorption hawks et al 2019 reported that the selective removal of nitrate was achieved by constructing a carbon based material composed entirely of narrow pores 1 nm hong et al 2020 prepared a layered double hydroxide reduced graphene oxide composite electrode ldh rgo that used a ligand exchange process to achieve the specific adsorption of phosphate however a new problem has been raised that is how to effectively and accurately control the ion selectivity of cdi to meet various practical treatment needs such as the need for simultaneous denitrification and phosphorus removal in urban sewage treatment in china in such an actual treatment process large amounts of nitrate and phosphate must be removed simultaneously but the treatment is difficult due to the pronounced difference in the concentration between these two ions see section 3 5 for details and the low selectivity of phosphate therefore selective adjustment according to the actual treatment target and further work enabling quantitative prediction of adsorption performance are necessary to determine the practical application potential of cdi the main purpose of this work is to quantitatively evaluate the regulatory role of the functional groups on cdi anion selectivity and to apply the optimized cdi for simultaneous denitrification and dephosphorization of municipal wastewater we regulated the selective adsorption performance of cdi for four anions chloride nitrate dihydrogen phosphate and sulfate using different functional group acidic group carboxyl basic group amino content distributions to elucidate the role played by functional groups in anion adsorption the effect of functional groups on the anion adsorption energy was calculated using density functional theory dft and a preliminary prediction model of anion adsorption was constructed based on the energy of the adsorption anion valence and hydration energy finally the application potential of the functional group mediated selectivity was verified by the construction of a cdi stack for treating simulated wastewater first level b emission standard china this work will help promote the application of cdi in actual water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 material preparation activated carbon ac hebei chengde

significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization the microscopic morphologies of the materials before and after modification are shown in fig s3 during the modification process nitric acid had an etching effect on the pore structure of ac and the pore structure aco1 aco2 became abundant under short term oxidation however excessive oxidation will lead to the collapse of the pore structure aco4 moreover since acox is further modified on the basis of acox it inherits the surface morphology of acox this is also confirmed by the pore structure parameters presented for all materials in table s1 and fig s4 the results show that with increasing oxidation time the oxidative etching effect of nitric acid gradually increases the mesoporous pore volume and the mesoporosity of acox materials but excessive modification leads to a decrease in the mesoporous pore volume aco4 the changes in the mesoporous character of the aconx material are similar to those of the acox material on the other hand the grafted amino group significantly reduced the pore volume of the micropores of the aconx material which may be due to the pore volume of the micropores being occupied by ethylenediamine after dehydration and condensation the group content of all materials after modification is shown in fig 1 a after oxidation by nitric acid the carboxyl content of acox increased compared with that of ac after grafting of ethylenediamine the amino content of aconx was significantly increased compared with that of acox an examination of the zeta potential values of all materials fig 1b shows that oxidation by nitric acid and grafted amino groups reduces the negative charge on the surface of the material the surface of the original ac had many negative charges according to previous studies the oxidation by nitric acid will not only lead to the formation of new oxygen containing functional groups but will also destroy the original oxygen containing functional groups and nonmetal negatively charged groups jankovský et al 2017 ternero hidalgo et al 2016 the final result of oxidation will be determined by the original characteristics of the materials and the degree of oxidation vinke et al 1994 in this study ac with a large number of negative surface charges and mild oxidative modification conditions resulted in the formation of negatively charged groups such as carboxyl groups however the amount of the formed negatively charged groups was lower than the amount of the removed negatively charged groups so that the overall negative charge of the acox material was reduced similar results were also reported by rico et al 2019 at the same time eds measurements fig s5 and table s2 also showed that the nitric acid oxidation process removed a large amount of impurities both the ion desorption of acox materials in the early stage of the desalination process fig s7a and the release of sulfate in the anion competition adsorption fig s8 proved that a large number of negatively charged groups were released from the surface of ac after oxidation the preparation process does not introduce any sulfur into the materials on the other hand the material was further grafted with amino groups and the amino groups were protonated to neutralize some of the negative charge resulting in a further reduction in the negative charge on the material surface fig 1c e show the xps spectra of the carboxylated materials aco2 aminated materials acon2 and ac the overall spectrum shows clear differences in the n contents of the three materials the assignment of each component spectrum peak is summarized in table s3 the o 1 s spectrum fig 1d can be deconvoluted into three components located at 531 6 532 7 and 533 8 ev fan et al 2013 corresponding to o c o lipid or carboxyl c o c oh oxygen in phenol alcohol fatty ether or ketone groups and o c o oxygen in aryl ether or carboxyl groups the peak at 531 6 ev in the spectrum of ac is stronger than that in the spectra of aco2 and acon2 but the peak at 533 8 ev is weaker indicating that the original ac contains many lipids that form some carboxyl groups after oxidation by nitric acid the n 1 s spectrum of acon2 fig 1e can be deconvoluted into a c n peak at 399 9 ev a c n peak at 401 6 ev and a c n peak at 406 5 ev amare and admassie 2020 indicating that amino groups were successfully introduced into the material surface we tested the cv properties of all materials in different electrolyte solutions the cv curves in fig s6 are rectangular like indicating that all materials are dominated by electric double layer capacitance the overall variation trend of the specific capacitance among the materials is shown in fig 2 a the observed variation trends are determined by both the functional group distribution and the pore structure of the electrode in carboxylated materials an increase in the carboxyl group content will increase the repulsion of the anions by the electrodes and an increase in mesoporosity will further increase the likelihood of the anions to be repelled for a charging process completed in a short time the anions do not have time to redistribute among the storage sites therefore with increasing carboxyl content and mesoporosity the specific capacitance of aco2 decreases relative to that of aco1 furthermore the carboxyl group content of aco3 decreased but the mesoporosity further increased under the combined action of these two effect the specific capacitance recovered slightly while the carboxyl content of aco4 did not change much compared with that of aco3 the obvious pore structure damage caused the specific capacitance to decrease again the higher specific capacitance of aco1 compared to ac can be attributed to the activation of the pore structure and weaker carboxyl group formation under mild modification on the other hand it is important to note that since nitrate has the lowest hydration energy the highest hydration energy wu et al 2020 its diffusion resistance inside the electrode is lower than that of other anions and it is less affected by mesoporosity therefore the change in the specific capacitance of carboxylated materials in nitrate electrolyte is more strongly dependent on the change in the carboxyl group content as observed from the differences between the specific capacitances of aco1 aco2 and aco3 in nitrate electrolyte solution the relationship between the variation of the specific capacitance between the aminated materials and their structural characteristics is relatively simple the increase in either the mesoporosity or the amino group content increases the specific capacitance so that the overall specific capacitance of acon1 acon2 and acon3 increases sequentially however the damaged pore structure of acon4 leads to a decrease in the specific capacitance it is important to mention that the large reduction in the micropores of the aminated materials compared to ac leads to a significant decrease in their specific capacitance relative to that of ac with smaller differences between the specific capacitances of the aminated materials fig 2b shows the eis curves of different materials it is observed that the modified material has enhanced mesoporosity due to the etching effect of nitric acid and the substance transfer resistance is significantly lower than that of ac at the same time with the exception of aco1 the charge transfer resistances of the other materials is also lower than that of ac 3 2 competitive adsorption of materials with different functional group distributions before exploring the competitive anion adsorption performance of the modified materials we tested the desalination process of each material to explore the effectiveness of the modified materials for anion adsorption the results are presented in fig s7 and show that both carboxylated and aminated materials can be used as anodes for anion adsorption it is important to note that when carboxyl materials are used for desalination an obvious increase in conductivity is observed in the early stage and the increase in conductivity then becomes more pronounced with increasing modification time proving that the oxidation of nitric acid removes a large number of negatively charged groups on the electrode surface as was deduced from the zeta potential test discussed above the overall effective desalination capacity of the carboxylated materials is lower than that of ac which was related to the ion release in the early stage of adsorption because the ion release offsets the adsorption in the early stage this is not the case for the aminated materials so that the desalination capacity is significantly increased for aco1 aco2 and aco3 the effective desalination capacity increases sequentially with increasing mesoporosity of the materials whereas the desalination capacity of aco4 decreases due to the destruction of the pore structure the role of mesoporosity in the desalination process is not consistent with the electrochemical tests because for the longer desalination process the anions can have sufficient time to redistribute the storage site and reduce the repulsion from the carboxyl group at this time the increase in mesoporosity will only reduce the diffusion resistance of anions in the electrode and improve the adsorption capacity of the electrode the trend of the desalination ability of the aminated materials is consistent with the trend in the changes of the amino group content this implies that anions are gathered around the amino groups due to the affinity of amino groups for the anions and the number of amino groups determines the final adsorption capacity we also evaluated the energy consumption during desalination and it was found that the charge efficiency of aco1 is lower than that of ac which is related to the increase in the charge transfer resistance of aco1 the charge efficiency of other materials is increased by a certain amount due to their lower charge transfer resistance and substance transfer resistance compared to those of ac however overall the charge efficiency is not high approximately 50 which is related to the co ion repulsion phenomenon in the desalination process furthermore we performed competitive adsorption evaluations for all materials in the presence of four anions 0 4 mm c l 0 4 mm no 3 0 4 mm h 2 po 4 and 0 4 mm so 4 2 and the results are shown in fig 3 a the related adsorption processes are shown in fig s8 according to fig 3a the materials in the aco series exhibited a decrease in the adsorption capacity of all anions except h 2 po 4 and as the degree of modification increased the adsorption capacity decrease became more pronounced this is because as the degree of modification increases the carboxylated materials release more anions in the early stages of adsorption as shown in fig s8 as described in the desalination results and the higher anion release leads to a lower absolute amount of adsorption in a fixed adsorption time the adsorption of so 4 2 was affected the most and was 0 for the aco materials however the aco materials were more favorable for the adsorption of h 2 po 4 although the final adsorbed amount of h 2 po 4 also decreased as the degree of modification increased it was significantly less inhibited than that of other anions when carboxylation was mild the adsorption capacity of h 2 po 4 was higher than that of ac the competitive adsorption performance of the acon materials was the complete opposite of that of the aco materials the acon materials showed a significant increase in the adsorption capacity of h 2 po 4 and so 4 2 and the increase in so 4 2 was more pronounced in addition the acon materials did not inhibit the adsorption of c l and no 3 the selection coefficient of each anion was calculated using a previously reported equation hawks et al 2019 given here as eq 3 as shown in fig 3b the selectivity coefficients of h 2 po 4 and so 4 2 indicate that amination obviously promotes the selectivity of so 4 2 and h 2 po 4 with stronger promotion for so 4 2 carboxylation clearly promotes the selectivity for h 2 po 4 3 k x s a c x c e b c e x s a c b where sac x represents the concentration of the target ions adsorbed mmol g ce x is the target ion equilibrium concentration mmol l sac b is the amount of the coexisting ions adsorbed mmol g and ce b is the coexisting ion equilibrium concentration mmol l a greater kx corresponds to higher selectivity for x the tendency toward change caused by different groups can be explained by the protonation tendency of the functional groups and anions wu et al 2020 the carboxyl group cooh tends to exist in the deprotonated state coo in this state the oxygen atom in the carboxyl group is more likely to serve as a hydrogen bond accepting site to bind to the hydrogen donor among the four anions only h 2 po 4 has hydrogen atoms under neutral conditions and can bind to the deprotonated carboxyl group the other anions only repel the carboxyl group because of their negative charge particularly so 4 2 which is a divalent anion and therefore experiences the strongest repulsion by contrast under the electric field there are both protonated nh 3 and deprotonated nh2 amino groups the protonated amino group acts as a hydrogen bond donor while the deprotonated amino group acts as both a hydrogen bond acceptor and a hydrogen donor under these conditions all four anions can act as hydrogen bond acceptors and have affinity to amino groups however unlike the other two anions h 2 po 4 and so 4 2 have a site that can supply hydrogen and a site that can accept hydrogen respectively so that they exhibit stronger affinity because the hydrogen receiving site can be combined with both protonated and nonprotonated amino groups it has more binding opportunities so that so 4 2 has a higher affinity for amino groups than h 2 po 4 although the specific adsorption of the electrode cannot be achieved through hydrogen bonding the results of the selectivity modification are in line with our expectations the modified electrodes show improved simultaneous denitrification and phosphorus removal effects on municipal sewage as will be discussed in detail in section 3 5 3 3 calculation of the effect of functional groups on anion adsorption by dft simulation to quantitatively describe the effect of functional groups on anion adsorption we used dft to simulate the adsorption of four anions on different surfaces and calculated the corresponding adsorption energy eads ev and the effect of the functional groups on the anion adsorption energy with the results shown in figs 4 and s9 the formula for the calculation of eads of different anions on different surfaces is shown in eq 4 and the influence of the functional groups on the adsorption energy of anions was calculated using eq 5 4 e a d s x a y e x a y e x a e y 5 e a d s a y e a d s x a y e a d s x a where eads x a y represents the adsorption energy of ions y on the surface x a and the system total energies of x a y x a and y are represented by e x a y e x a and e y respectively the adsorption energies of different anions on different adsorption substrates are shown in table s5 eads a y represents the effect of group a on the adsorption energy of ions y and eads x a y and eads x y represent the adsorption energy of ions on the surface with groups and without groups respectively the influence of carboxyl and amino groups on the adsorption of four anions is shown in fig 4d the simulated calculation results verify the competitive adsorption of anions carboxyl groups promoted the adsorption of h 2 po 4 and the ead s co o h 2 po 4 was 0 3861 ev while the inhibition effect of carboxyl groups on so 4 2 was the strongest with an ead s co o so 4 2 of 0 07279 ev by contrast carboxyl groups had affinity for h 2 po 4 but strongly rejected so 4 2 however the amino group promoted the adsorption of all anions with the greatest promotion for so 4 2 adsorption followed by that of h 2 po 4 the ead s n h 2 so 4 2 and ead s n h 2 h 2 po 4 were 0 8720 ev and 0 7733 ev respectively when the anions were in competition with each other the amino group tended to bind to so 4 2 followed by h 2 po 4 3 4 multivariate regression analysis of anion adsorption based on the nature of the anions and material functional groups multivariate linear regression analysis was used to comprehensively evaluate the effects of the properties of the material functional groups and anions on the adsorption capacity of anions on the electrode surface furthermore a predictive model for anion adsorption was constructed based on these factors this model uses the amount of anion adsorption as the dependent variable and the effect of functional groups on the adsorption energy of the anions eads a y the valence of anions and the hydration energy of anions as independent variables our previous studies have proven that the valence and hydration energy of anions significantly affect the adsorption capacity of anions deng et al 2021 all data used in the model are shown in table s6 the standardized regression residual diagram is shown in fig 5 a the data are distributed on and near the diagonal the regression model conforms to the normality assumption and can be used for regression analysis the regression results are shown in table 1 r2 0 7253 indicating that the regression model is statistically significant eads a y anion valence and anion hydration energy are all significantly correlated with the anion adsorption capacity p 0 05 eads a y and anion valence are negatively correlated with anion adsorption capacity and anion hydration energy and anion adsorption capacity are positively correlated this result is in agreement with the objective law that the independent variable affects the dependent variable an ion with more negative valence state experiences a stronger effect of the electric field which is conducive to adsorption a lower negative hydration energy leads to a higher dehydration barrier that the ion must overcome during adsorption disfavoring adsorption a lower negative eads a y results in a higher release of adsorption energy which is conducive to adsorption as shown in fig 5b comparison of the measured values with the predicted values of the regression model shows that the measured values are relatively close to the predicted values r2 0 72531 3 5 cdi stack treats wastewater with high standards nitrogen and phosphorus have always been strictly limited by various national pollution standards fan et al 2022 in the emission standards for our region the regulations for nitrogen and phosphorus are nb 20 mg l pb 1 mg l and na 15 mg l pa 0 5 mg l respectively a represents the first level a emission standard and b represents the first level b emission standard municipal sewage discharge standards gb18918 2002 china under such concentration differences the removal of phosphorus is not easy limiting the treatment effect we used cdi stacks with modified materials as electrodes to treat the first level b standard wastewater until it reached the first level a standard the cdi stack is shown in fig 6 c it should be noted that the anion selectivity and adsorption capacity of the electrode should be comprehensively considered in wastewater treatment so that we chose acon1 as the anode of the cdi stack for the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus the effluent results are shown in fig 6a b and the changes in the conductivity and current are shown in fig s10 in a time period of 10 100 min the effluent water quality reached the first level a standard through treatment by a cdi stack the removal of no 3 was the most obvious after 30 min it was maintained at a concentration of 0 13 mmol l which is far lower than the 1 mmol l required by the first level a standard and the removal rate surpassed 90 the cdi stack also effectively removed h 2 po 4 and the minimum concentration reached 0 01 mmol l which is lower than the required 0 016 mmol l when the anions were released through a short circuit the release of h 2 po 4 was not obvious and other anions were effectively released this was due to the higher valence and lower hydration energy of h 2 po 4 compared to those of the other anions these characteristics made it easier for the ions to stay in the electrode pores as they were released deng et al 2021 when h 2 po 4 was released the anions experienced weaker electrostatic repulsion by coexisting anions than by other anions additionally the lower hydration energy indicates that h 2 po 4 does not easily migrate freely however because the total phosphorus adsorption capacity required by the treatment target is not high the cdi stack can be effectively reused on the other hand the water production rate and anion enrichment effect in a single run process were not good considering that multiple cycles will lead to a decrease in the total adsorption capacity as shown in fig s11 the adsorption capacity of the cdi stack after 30 runs decreased by nearly 50 due to the incomplete release of the ions during the regeneration process in this phenomenon the reduction of co ion repulsion and the adsorption of counterions hinder ion release difficult furthermore this leads to a reduction in the water production rate therefore we propose a new running mode to overcome the disadvantage of a single run in the new operating mode a fixed volume of the solution is processed by the cdi stack the produced water that meets the standard is collected the produced water that does not meet the standard is returned and the concentrate from the regeneration process is also returned that is in the whole process no solutions are discharged except for the water that meets the standard this means that with the increase in the number of cycles the concentration of the concentrate will gradually increase and because only the water that meets the standard is discharged the water production rate will continue to increase according to this new operation mode we treated 5 l of first level b standard wastewater and the results are shown in figs 7 and s12 the remaining solution after each regeneration is used as the solution for the next treatment and the sampling time of each time is shown in fig s12 since the increase in the influent concentration will lead to the increase in the minimum concentration of the effluent the sampling time of the subsequent treatment will be more concentrated and the water production will be relatively reduced as shown in fig 7a d until the 7th cycle the cdi stack could not treat the influent to the first level a standard the nitrate treatment failed to meet the standard and the cycle treatment ended it is important to mention that if the cdi stack is enlarged it will be possible to continue the treatment for multiple cycles so that the water production rate can be further improved and the anions can be further enriched after 6 cycles of treatment the total amount of the produced water that meets the first level a standard was nearly 4 l fig 7f g and the average concentrations of c l no 3 so 4 2 and h 2 po 4 were 2 585 0 642 2 866 and 0 013 mmol l respectively fig 7h the remaining concentrate is only 1 l and the treated water yield reaches nearly 80 which is quite high in the remaining 1 l of concentrated solution the concentrations of c l no 3 and so 4 2 were 3 603 3 563 and 4 084 mmol l fig 7a c corresponding to enrichment by 1 33 2 6 and 1 33 times respectively among these the enrichment effect of no 3 is more pronounced because in the later cycles the increase in no 3 concentration favors its adsorption however h 2 po 4 has no enrichment effect fig 7d which is related to the difficulty of h 2 po 4 release in a single run meanwhile h 2 po 4 showed that the effluent concentration was higher than the influent concentration in the second and third treatments fig 7d which may be related to the reverse adsorption of the ions during the previous regeneration that is during the regeneration process the anions in the solution are reversely adsorbed to the cathode but with the release of cations other anions are also released whereas h 2 po 4 remains at the cathode due to the difficulty of release and is released by the electric field force in the next treatment process however this phenomenon only occurs in the first few treatments because as the number of cycles increases h 2 po 4 will eventually transfer to the anode it may be possible to limit reverse adsorption by adding ion exchange membranes to the electrode surface but this may affect the enrichment of anions as the anions on the membrane displace the anions in the solution we evaluated the total energy consumption of six cycles as shown in fig 7i the total energy consumption was 0 00108659 kw h and the energy consumption per unit of produced water was only 0 27684 kw h t which fully reflects the energy savings of cdi technology finally with this optimized mode of operation it is feasible to obtain highly enriched concentrates after scaling up the cdi stack which will enable subsequent resource recovery such as the use of highly enriched nitrate concentrates to produce hoagland s nutrient solution 4 conclusions in this work we studied the competitive adsorption properties of carbon materials containing different functional groups using four anions competitive adsorption results and dft calculations showed that the type and content of functional groups significantly affect the electrode s adsorption selectivity for the four anions the carboxyl group significantly promotes the selectivity of h 2 po 4 and the amino group tends to promote the selectivity of so 4 2 and h 2 po 4 the valence state hydration energy of anions and the influence of the functional groups of the material on anion adsorption were used as the independent variables to construct a model for predicting the anion adsorption capacity the correlation was significant p 0 05 and the correlation coefficient of the model was 0 7253 representing the quantified effect of the various factors on anion selectivity we used acon1 ac to form a cdi stack containing 20 pairs of asymmetric electrodes and successfully treated first level b standard simulated wastewater to the first level a standard by optimizing the operating mode a water production rate of nearly 80 was

15679,capacitive deionization cdi has been widely studied as a highly efficient method for the removal of charged pollutants in sewage however the control of ion selectivity has always been challenging limiting the application of this approach in this article the regulation of different acid base functional group distributions on the selectivity of four anions are comprehensively discussed the effects are quantified through simulations and statistical analysis finally optimized cdi is used for the simultaneous denitrification and dephosphorization of municipal wastewater the results show that carboxyl groups significantly promote the selectivity of dihydrogen phosphate and that amino groups promote the selectivity of sulfate and dihydrogen phosphate density functional theory is used to calculate the influence of the functional groups on the anion adsorption energy compared with other anions the energy released is improved when carboxyl groups are included in the adsorption of dihydrogen phosphate the increase in the released energy is highest when amino groups participate in the adsorption of sulfate and is second highest when they participate in the adsorption of dihydrogen phosphate statistical analysis shows that the valence and hydration energy of the anion and the effect of the functional groups on anion adsorption are significantly related to anion adsorption p 0 05 and the correlation coefficient of the model is 0 7253 a cdi stack for the removal of phosphorus and nitrogen under high background ion concentrations is constructed and applied and it is shown that the treated wastewater meets higher discharge standards moreover the method reaches nearly 80 water production under optimized operating modes this study reveals the importance of functional groups in ion selective regulation and provides a potential method for high standard wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords capacitive deionization cdi anions functional group selectivity data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is a novel water treatment method that can effectively remove charged pollutants from water wang et al 2022b liang et al 2022 during cdi the electric field induces anions and cations to move to the two poles and the ions form and are stored in an electric double layer edl at the solid liquid interface sli returning to solution via a short circuit fan et al 2017 ying et al 2002 since a voltage of 1 23 v is required for water electrolysis a voltage of 1 2 v is usually used in cdi in order to avoid the faraday reaction liang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 a low voltage is used as the core driving force during operation enabling cdi to save energy and prevent secondary pollution due to these advantages this technology has attracted extensive research attention wang et al 2022a biesheuvel et al 2011 chaleawlert umpon 2020 huyskens et al 2013 liu et al 2019 mohamed et al 2021 porada et al 2013 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2020 in related studies that have been reported to date improving the total electrosorption capacity through the optimization of electrode materials has been widely discussed ding et al 2022 wang et al 2022c khalil et al 2020 liu et al 2015 park and kwak 2014 ratajczak et al 2019 shih et al 2019 su et al 2020 tian et al 2020 xu et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 however wastewater that needs to be treated usually contains a variety of coexisting ions therefore it is unwise to consider only the high adsorption capacity and ignore the ion selectivity of cdi such an approach will limit the application of cdi in actual wastewater treatment because it is often unnecessary to remove all ions in the treatment process an increasing number of researchers have begun to realize the importance of selectivity and have focused on the exploration and improvement of the selectivity of cdi electrodes avraham et al 2008 eliad et al 2001 gabelich et al 2002 gamaethiralalage et al 2021 huang and su 2010 to date a relatively unified understanding of the mechanism of cdi ion selectivity has been obtained many studies have shown that material properties such as pore structure and ion properties such as ion valence and hydration energy affect selectivity hou and huang 2013 mossad et al 2013 for example we previously studied the competitive adsorption of four anions chloride nitrate dihydrogen phosphate and sulfate deng et al 2021 due to the difference in valence and hydration energy the order of adsorption on the carbon electrode was nitrate chloride sulfate dihydrogen phosphate the preferential adsorption of nitrate was attributed to its easy desolvation due to its high hydration energy the selectivity of dihydrogen phosphate was the weakest due to its lower hydration energy and lower electronegativity so that its adsorption is favored neither by its charge advantage nor by its desolvation behavior based on these selectivity mechanisms researchers have achieved specific partial ion adsorption hawks et al 2019 reported that the selective removal of nitrate was achieved by constructing a carbon based material composed entirely of narrow pores 1 nm hong et al 2020 prepared a layered double hydroxide reduced graphene oxide composite electrode ldh rgo that used a ligand exchange process to achieve the specific adsorption of phosphate however a new problem has been raised that is how to effectively and accurately control the ion selectivity of cdi to meet various practical treatment needs such as the need for simultaneous denitrification and phosphorus removal in urban sewage treatment in china in such an actual treatment process large amounts of nitrate and phosphate must be removed simultaneously but the treatment is difficult due to the pronounced difference in the concentration between these two ions see section 3 5 for details and the low selectivity of phosphate therefore selective adjustment according to the actual treatment target and further work enabling quantitative prediction of adsorption performance are necessary to determine the practical application potential of cdi the main purpose of this work is to quantitatively evaluate the regulatory role of the functional groups on cdi anion selectivity and to apply the optimized cdi for simultaneous denitrification and dephosphorization of municipal wastewater we regulated the selective adsorption performance of cdi for four anions chloride nitrate dihydrogen phosphate and sulfate using different functional group acidic group carboxyl basic group amino content distributions to elucidate the role played by functional groups in anion adsorption the effect of functional groups on the anion adsorption energy was calculated using density functional theory dft and a preliminary prediction model of anion adsorption was constructed based on the energy of the adsorption anion valence and hydration energy finally the application potential of the functional group mediated selectivity was verified by the construction of a cdi stack for treating simulated wastewater first level b emission standard china this work will help promote the application of cdi in actual water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 material preparation activated carbon ac hebei chengde

adsorption energy of functional groups to anions as independent variables and the adsorption capacities of anions as dependent variables p values of 0 05 were considered to indicate statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization the microscopic morphologies of the materials before and after modification are shown in fig s3 during the modification process nitric acid had an etching effect on the pore structure of ac and the pore structure aco1 aco2 became abundant under short term oxidation however excessive oxidation will lead to the collapse of the pore structure aco4 moreover since acox is further modified on the basis of acox it inherits the surface morphology of acox this is also confirmed by the pore structure parameters presented for all materials in table s1 and fig s4 the results show that with increasing oxidation time the oxidative etching effect of nitric acid gradually increases the mesoporous pore volume and the mesoporosity of acox materials but excessive modification leads to a decrease in the mesoporous pore volume aco4 the changes in the mesoporous character of the aconx material are similar to those of the acox material on the other hand the grafted amino group significantly reduced the pore volume of the micropores of the aconx material which may be due to the pore volume of the micropores being occupied by ethylenediamine after dehydration and condensation the group content of all materials after modification is shown in fig 1 a after oxidation by nitric acid the carboxyl content of acox increased compared with that of ac after grafting of ethylenediamine the amino content of aconx was significantly increased compared with that of acox an examination of the zeta potential values of all materials fig 1b shows that oxidation by nitric acid and grafted amino groups reduces the negative charge on the surface of the material the surface of the original ac had many negative charges according to previous studies the oxidation by nitric acid will not only lead to the formation of new oxygen containing functional groups but will also destroy the original oxygen containing functional groups and nonmetal negatively charged groups jankovský et al 2017 ternero hidalgo et al 2016 the final result of oxidation will be determined by the original characteristics of the materials and the degree of oxidation vinke et al 1994 in this study ac with a large number of negative surface charges and mild oxidative modification conditions resulted in the formation of negatively charged groups such as carboxyl groups however the amount of the formed negatively charged groups was lower than the amount of the removed negatively charged groups so that the overall negative charge of the acox material was reduced similar results were also reported by rico et al 2019 at the same time eds measurements fig s5 and table s2 also showed that the nitric acid oxidation process removed a large amount of impurities both the ion desorption of acox materials in the early stage of the desalination process fig s7a and the release of sulfate in the anion competition adsorption fig s8 proved that a large number of negatively charged groups were released from the surface of ac after oxidation the preparation process does not introduce any sulfur into the materials on the other hand the material was further grafted with amino groups and the amino groups were protonated to neutralize some of the negative charge resulting in a further reduction in the negative charge on the material surface fig 1c e show the xps spectra of the carboxylated materials aco2 aminated materials acon2 and ac the overall spectrum shows clear differences in the n contents of the three materials the assignment of each component spectrum peak is summarized in table s3 the o 1 s spectrum fig 1d can be deconvoluted into three components located at 531 6 532 7 and 533 8 ev fan et al 2013 corresponding to o c o lipid or carboxyl c o c oh oxygen in phenol alcohol fatty ether or ketone groups and o c o oxygen in aryl ether or carboxyl groups the peak at 531 6 ev in the spectrum of ac is stronger than that in the spectra of aco2 and acon2 but the peak at 533 8 ev is weaker indicating that the original ac contains many lipids that form some carboxyl groups after oxidation by nitric acid the n 1 s spectrum of acon2 fig 1e can be deconvoluted into a c n peak at 399 9 ev a c n peak at 401 6 ev and a c n peak at 406 5 ev amare and admassie 2020 indicating that amino groups were successfully introduced into the material surface we tested the cv properties of all materials in different electrolyte solutions the cv curves in fig s6 are rectangular like indicating that all materials are dominated by electric double layer capacitance the overall variation trend of the specific capacitance among the materials is shown in fig 2 a the observed variation trends are determined by both the functional group distribution and the pore structure of the electrode in carboxylated materials an increase in the carboxyl group content will increase the repulsion of the anions by the electrodes and an increase in mesoporosity will further increase the likelihood of the anions to be repelled for a charging process completed in a short time the anions do not have time to redistribute among the storage sites therefore with increasing carboxyl content and mesoporosity the specific capacitance of aco2 decreases relative to that of aco1 furthermore the carboxyl group content of aco3 decreased but the mesoporosity further increased under the combined action of these two effect the specific capacitance recovered slightly while the carboxyl content of aco4 did not change much compared with that of aco3 the obvious pore structure damage caused the specific capacitance to decrease again the higher specific capacitance of aco1 compared to ac can be attributed to the activation of the pore structure and weaker carboxyl group formation under mild modification on the other hand it is important to note that since nitrate has the lowest hydration energy the highest hydration energy wu et al 2020 its diffusion resistance inside the electrode is lower than that of other anions and it is less affected by mesoporosity therefore the change in the specific capacitance of carboxylated materials in nitrate electrolyte is more strongly dependent on the change in the carboxyl group content as observed from the differences between the specific capacitances of aco1 aco2 and aco3 in nitrate electrolyte solution the relationship between the variation of the specific capacitance between the aminated materials and their structural characteristics is relatively simple the increase in either the mesoporosity or the amino group content increases the specific capacitance so that the overall specific capacitance of acon1 acon2 and acon3 increases sequentially however the damaged pore structure of acon4 leads to a decrease in the specific capacitance it is important to mention that the large reduction in the micropores of the aminated materials compared to ac leads to a significant decrease in their specific capacitance relative to that of ac with smaller differences between the specific capacitances of the aminated materials fig 2b shows the eis curves of different materials it is observed that the modified material has enhanced mesoporosity due to the etching effect of nitric acid and the substance transfer resistance is significantly lower than that of ac at the same time with the exception of aco1 the charge transfer resistances of the other materials is also lower than that of ac 3 2 competitive adsorption of materials with different functional group distributions before exploring the competitive anion adsorption performance of the modified materials we tested the desalination process of each material to explore the effectiveness of the modified materials for anion adsorption the results are presented in fig s7 and show that both carboxylated and aminated materials can be used as anodes for anion adsorption it is important to note that when carboxyl materials are used for desalination an obvious increase in conductivity is observed in the early stage and the increase in conductivity then becomes more pronounced with increasing modification time proving that the oxidation of nitric acid removes a large number of negatively charged groups on the electrode surface as was deduced from the zeta potential test discussed above the overall effective desalination capacity of the carboxylated materials is lower than that of ac which was related to the ion release in the early stage of adsorption because the ion release offsets the adsorption in the early stage this is not the case for the aminated materials so that the desalination capacity is significantly increased for aco1 aco2 and aco3 the effective desalination capacity increases sequentially with increasing mesoporosity of the materials whereas the desalination capacity of aco4 decreases due to the destruction of the pore structure the role of mesoporosity in the desalination process is not consistent with the electrochemical tests because for the longer desalination process the anions can have sufficient time to redistribute the storage site and reduce the repulsion from the carboxyl group at this time the increase in mesoporosity will only reduce the diffusion resistance of anions in the electrode and improve the adsorption capacity of the electrode the trend of the desalination ability of the aminated materials is consistent with the trend in the changes of the amino group content this implies that anions are gathered around the amino groups due to the affinity of amino groups for the anions and the number of amino groups determines the final adsorption capacity we also evaluated the energy consumption during desalination and it was found that the charge efficiency of aco1 is lower than that of ac which is related to the increase in the charge transfer resistance of aco1 the charge efficiency of other materials is increased by a certain amount due to their lower charge transfer resistance and substance transfer resistance compared to those of ac however overall the charge efficiency is not high approximately 50 which is related to the co ion repulsion phenomenon in the desalination process furthermore we performed competitive adsorption evaluations for all materials in the presence of four anions 0 4 mm c l 0 4 mm no 3 0 4 mm h 2 po 4 and 0 4 mm so 4 2 and the results are shown in fig 3 a the related adsorption processes are shown in fig s8 according to fig 3a the materials in the aco series exhibited a decrease in the adsorption capacity of all anions except h 2 po 4 and as the degree of modification increased the adsorption capacity decrease became more pronounced this is because as the degree of modification increases the carboxylated materials release more anions in the early stages of adsorption as shown in fig s8 as described in the desalination results and the higher anion release leads to a lower absolute amount of adsorption in a fixed adsorption time the adsorption of so 4 2 was affected the most and was 0 for the aco materials however the aco materials were more favorable for the adsorption of h 2 po 4 although the final adsorbed amount of h 2 po 4 also decreased as the degree of modification increased it was significantly less inhibited than that of other anions when carboxylation was mild the adsorption capacity of h 2 po 4 was higher than that of ac the competitive adsorption performance of the acon materials was the complete opposite of that of the aco materials the acon materials showed a significant increase in the adsorption capacity of h 2 po 4 and so 4 2 and the increase in so 4 2 was more pronounced in addition the acon materials did not inhibit the adsorption of c l and no 3 the selection coefficient of each anion was calculated using a previously reported equation hawks et al 2019 given here as eq 3 as shown in fig 3b the selectivity coefficients of h 2 po 4 and so 4 2 indicate that amination obviously promotes the selectivity of so 4 2 and h 2 po 4 with stronger promotion for so 4 2 carboxylation clearly promotes the selectivity for h 2 po 4 3 k x s a c x c e b c e x s a c b where sac x represents the concentration of the target ions adsorbed mmol g ce x is the target ion equilibrium concentration mmol l sac b is the amount of the coexisting ions adsorbed mmol g and ce b is the coexisting ion equilibrium concentration mmol l a greater kx corresponds to higher selectivity for x the tendency toward change caused by different groups can be explained by the protonation tendency of the functional groups and anions wu et al 2020 the carboxyl group cooh tends to exist in the deprotonated state coo in this state the oxygen atom in the carboxyl group is more likely to serve as a hydrogen bond accepting site to bind to the hydrogen donor among the four anions only h 2 po 4 has hydrogen atoms under neutral conditions and can bind to the deprotonated carboxyl group the other anions only repel the carboxyl group because of their negative charge particularly so 4 2 which is a divalent anion and therefore experiences the strongest repulsion by contrast under the electric field there are both protonated nh 3 and deprotonated nh2 amino groups the protonated amino group acts as a hydrogen bond donor while the deprotonated amino group acts as both a hydrogen bond acceptor and a hydrogen donor under these conditions all four anions can act as hydrogen bond acceptors and have affinity to amino groups however unlike the other two anions h 2 po 4 and so 4 2 have a site that can supply hydrogen and a site that can accept hydrogen respectively so that they exhibit stronger affinity because the hydrogen receiving site can be combined with both protonated and nonprotonated amino groups it has more binding opportunities so that so 4 2 has a higher affinity for amino groups than h 2 po 4 although the specific adsorption of the electrode cannot be achieved through hydrogen bonding the results of the selectivity modification are in line with our expectations the modified electrodes show improved simultaneous denitrification and phosphorus removal effects on municipal sewage as will be discussed in detail in section 3 5 3 3 calculation of the effect of functional groups on anion adsorption by dft simulation to quantitatively describe the effect of functional groups on anion adsorption we used dft to simulate the adsorption of four anions on different surfaces and calculated the corresponding adsorption energy eads ev and the effect of the functional groups on the anion adsorption energy with the results shown in figs 4 and s9 the formula for the calculation of eads of different anions on different surfaces is shown in eq 4 and the influence of the functional groups on the adsorption energy of anions was calculated using eq 5 4 e a d s x a y e x a y e x a e y 5 e a d s a y e a d s x a y e a d s x a where eads x a y represents the adsorption energy of ions y on the surface x a and the system total energies of x a y x a and y are represented by e x a y e x a and e y respectively the adsorption energies of different anions on different adsorption substrates are shown in table s5 eads a y represents the effect of group a on the adsorption energy of ions y and eads x a y and eads x y represent the adsorption energy of ions on the surface with groups and without groups respectively the influence of carboxyl and amino groups on the adsorption of four anions is shown in fig 4d the simulated calculation results verify the competitive adsorption of anions carboxyl groups promoted the adsorption of h 2 po 4 and the ead s co o h 2 po 4 was 0 3861 ev while the inhibition effect of carboxyl groups on so 4 2 was the strongest with an ead s co o so 4 2 of 0 07279 ev by contrast carboxyl groups had affinity for h 2 po 4 but strongly rejected so 4 2 however the amino group promoted the adsorption of all anions with the greatest promotion for so 4 2 adsorption followed by that of h 2 po 4 the ead s n h 2 so 4 2 and ead s n h 2 h 2 po 4 were 0 8720 ev and 0 7733 ev respectively when the anions were in competition with each other the amino group tended to bind to so 4 2 followed by h 2 po 4 3 4 multivariate regression analysis of anion adsorption based on the nature of the anions and material functional groups multivariate linear regression analysis was used to comprehensively evaluate the effects of the properties of the material functional groups and anions on the adsorption capacity of anions on the electrode surface furthermore a predictive model for anion adsorption was constructed based on these factors this model uses the amount of anion adsorption as the dependent variable and the effect of functional groups on the adsorption energy of the anions eads a y the valence of anions and the hydration energy of anions as independent variables our previous studies have proven that the valence and hydration energy of anions significantly affect the adsorption capacity of anions deng et al 2021 all data used in the model are shown in table s6 the standardized regression residual diagram is shown in fig 5 a the data are distributed on and near the diagonal the regression model conforms to the normality assumption and can be used for regression analysis the regression results are shown in table 1 r2 0 7253 indicating that the regression model is statistically significant eads a y anion valence and anion hydration energy are all significantly correlated with the anion adsorption capacity p 0 05 eads a y and anion valence are negatively correlated with anion adsorption capacity and anion hydration energy and anion adsorption capacity are positively correlated this result is in agreement with the objective law that the independent variable affects the dependent variable an ion with more negative valence state experiences a stronger effect of the electric field which is conducive to adsorption a lower negative hydration energy leads to a higher dehydration barrier that the ion must overcome during adsorption disfavoring adsorption a lower negative eads a y results in a higher release of adsorption energy which is conducive to adsorption as shown in fig 5b comparison of the measured values with the predicted values of the regression model shows that the measured values are relatively close to the predicted values r2 0 72531 3 5 cdi stack treats wastewater with high standards nitrogen and phosphorus have always been strictly limited by various national pollution standards fan et al 2022 in the emission standards for our region the regulations for nitrogen and phosphorus are nb 20 mg l pb 1 mg l and na 15 mg l pa 0 5 mg l respectively a represents the first level a emission standard and b represents the first level b emission standard municipal sewage discharge standards gb18918 2002 china under such concentration differences the removal of phosphorus is not easy limiting the treatment effect we used cdi stacks with modified materials as electrodes to treat the first level b standard wastewater until it reached the first level a standard the cdi stack is shown in fig 6 c it should be noted that the anion selectivity and adsorption capacity of the electrode should be comprehensively considered in wastewater treatment so that we chose acon1 as the anode of the cdi stack for the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus the effluent results are shown in fig 6a b and the changes in the conductivity and current are shown in fig s10 in a time period of 10 100 min the effluent water quality reached the first level a standard through treatment by a cdi stack the removal of no 3 was the most obvious after 30 min it was maintained at a concentration of 0 13 mmol l which is far lower than the 1 mmol l required by the first level a standard and the removal rate surpassed 90 the cdi stack also effectively removed h 2 po 4 and the minimum concentration reached 0 01 mmol l which is lower than the required 0 016 mmol l when the anions were released through a short circuit the release of h 2 po 4 was not obvious and other anions were effectively released this was due to the higher valence and lower hydration energy of h 2 po 4 compared to those of the other anions these characteristics made it easier for the ions to stay in the electrode pores as they were released deng et al 2021 when h 2 po 4 was released the anions experienced weaker electrostatic repulsion by coexisting anions than by other anions additionally the lower hydration energy indicates that h 2 po 4 does not easily migrate freely however because the total phosphorus adsorption capacity required by the treatment target is not high the cdi stack can be effectively reused on the other hand the water production rate and anion enrichment effect in a single run process were not good considering that multiple cycles will lead to a decrease in the total adsorption capacity as shown in fig s11 the adsorption capacity of the cdi stack after 30 runs decreased by nearly 50 due to the incomplete release of the ions during the regeneration process in this phenomenon the reduction of co ion repulsion and the adsorption of counterions hinder ion release difficult furthermore this leads to a reduction in the water production rate therefore we propose a new running mode to overcome the disadvantage of a single run in the new operating mode a fixed volume of the solution is processed by the cdi stack the produced water that meets the standard is collected the produced water that does not meet the standard is returned and the concentrate from the regeneration process is also returned that is in the whole process no solutions are discharged except for the water that meets the standard this means that with the increase in the number of cycles the concentration of the concentrate will gradually increase and because only the water that meets the standard is discharged the water production rate will continue to increase according to this new operation mode we treated 5 l of first level b standard wastewater and the results are shown in figs 7 and s12 the remaining solution after each regeneration is used as the solution for the next treatment and the sampling time of each time is shown in fig s12 since the increase in the influent concentration will lead to the increase in the minimum concentration of the effluent the sampling time of the subsequent treatment will be more concentrated and the water production will be relatively reduced as shown in fig 7a d until the 7th cycle the cdi stack could not treat the influent to the first level a standard the nitrate treatment failed to meet the standard and the cycle treatment ended it is important to mention that if the cdi stack is enlarged it will be possible to continue the treatment for multiple cycles so that the water production rate can be further improved and the anions can be further enriched after 6 cycles of treatment the total amount of the produced water that meets the first level a standard was nearly 4 l fig 7f g and the average concentrations of c l no 3 so 4 2 and h 2 po 4 were 2 585 0 642 2 866 and 0 013 mmol l respectively fig 7h the remaining concentrate is only 1 l and the treated water yield reaches nearly 80 which is quite high in the remaining 1 l of concentrated solution the concentrations of c l no 3 and so 4 2 were 3 603 3 563 and 4 084 mmol l fig 7a c corresponding to enrichment by 1 33 2 6 and 1 33 times respectively among these the enrichment effect of no 3 is more pronounced because in the later cycles the increase in no 3 concentration favors its adsorption however h 2 po 4 has no enrichment effect fig 7d which is related to the difficulty of h 2 po 4 release in a single run meanwhile h 2 po 4 showed that the effluent concentration was higher than the influent concentration in the second and third treatments fig 7d which may be related to the reverse adsorption of the ions during the previous regeneration that is during the regeneration process the anions in the solution are reversely adsorbed to the cathode but with the release of cations other anions are also released whereas h 2 po 4 remains at the cathode due to the difficulty of release and is released by the electric field force in the next treatment process however this phenomenon only occurs in the first few treatments because as the number of cycles increases h 2 po 4 will eventually transfer to the anode it may be possible to limit reverse adsorption by adding ion exchange membranes to the electrode surface but this may affect the enrichment of anions as the anions on the membrane displace the anions in the solution we evaluated the total energy consumption of six cycles as shown in fig 7i the total energy consumption was 0 00108659 kw h and the energy consumption per unit of produced water was only 0 27684 kw h t which fully reflects the energy savings of cdi technology finally with this optimized mode of operation it is feasible to obtain highly enriched concentrates after scaling up the cdi stack which will enable subsequent resource recovery such as the use of highly enriched nitrate concentrates to produce hoagland s nutrient solution 4 conclusions in this work we studied the competitive adsorption properties of carbon materials containing different functional groups using four anions competitive adsorption results and dft calculations showed that the type and content of functional groups significantly affect the electrode s adsorption selectivity for the four anions the carboxyl group significantly promotes the selectivity of h 2 po 4 and the amino group tends to promote the selectivity of so 4 2 and h 2 po 4 the valence state hydration energy of anions and the influence of the functional groups of the material on anion adsorption were used as the independent variables to construct a model for predicting the anion adsorption capacity the correlation was significant p 0 05 and the correlation coefficient of the model was 0 7253 representing the quantified effect of the various factors on anion selectivity we used acon1 ac to form a cdi stack containing 20 pairs of asymmetric electrodes and successfully treated first level b standard simulated wastewater to the first level a standard by optimizing the operating mode a water production rate of nearly 80 was obtained verifying the application prospects of functional group modified carbon materials this study reveals the significant role and mechanism of functional groups in cdi ion selectivity and
