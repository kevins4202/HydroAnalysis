11280,in north west china the soybean glycine max l merr is grown in june when the climate is dry and soil has limited moisture contents moisture deficiency limits the soybean biomass we studied the effects of wheat straw mulching and nitrogen on soybean growth physiology and soil properties in three year field experiments the treatments included three straw mulching i e s1 0 kg ha 1 s2 3000 kg ha 1 and s3 6000 kg ha 1 and three nitrogen rates i e n1 0 kg n ha 1 n2 21 6 kg n ha 1 and n3 27 kg n ha 1 full mulching s3 significantly increased moisture retention 7 4 and decrease soil temperature 3 0 in 0 20 cm soil depth increased photosynthesis spad value leaf area leaf area index growth and soybean grain yield 20 8 over no mulching s1 the s3 improved the roots mass nodules number and weight than s1 the application of 27 kg n ha 1 or 100 n fertilizer n3 had significantly increased photosynthesis spad value growth and biomass and seed yield of soybean over no n application n1 it was concluded that using straw mulching 6 mg ha 1 can change the soil hydrothermal regime for provision of favorable condition for soybean growth when 27 kg n ha 1 was used in semi arid condition of north west china keywords crop physiology soil moisture crop yield soybean 1 introduction soybean glycine max l merr is one of the important edible and oilseed crops of china it is mostly grown in water deficient and marginal land in most parts of the world soybean beside soil fertility improvement also has valuable nutritional values for human being likewise it contributes 48 2 60 to the world oilseed acreage usda 2016 it fix about 50 300 kg n ha 1 in a year representing a major contribution keyser and li 1992 during 2014 15 soybean was globally cultivated on 118 2 million hectares of land having average production of 2699 kg ha 1 and grain yield 319 million tones usda 2016 soybean is a n fixing crop thus requires less n fertilizer however in north west china excessive n fertilizers are used for most of the crops li et al 2008 the average usage of n fertilizer 450 kg ha 1 had increased the chance of nitrate pollution of the ground water in the irrigated areas of north west china li et al 2005 this nitrate leaching was around 227 kg no3 n ha 1 in 0 90 cm soil layer at crop harvest stage cui et al 2006 and expecting to be increase with future n application thus n fertilization is widely accepted as a source of water pollution but at the same time it is needed for mineral n availability for the plants in a variety ecosystem of the world khan et al 2018 it was evident from the long term excessive use of n fertilization that excess use or long term application of n caused accumulation of residual n in north china fan et al 2003 ju et al 2006 therefore recently more discussing and important issue is the n cycling in agro ecosystem and need more consideration from scientists in china chuan et al 2015 the use of crop residues as mulching materials is an important management tools to pose positive effects on soil and crop growth akhtar et al 2018a b surface straw mulching retained more rain water and also had positive response on soil water content by controlling evaporation loss ali et al 2018 ghosh et al 2006 and hence decreased the soil temperature due to low thermal conductivity ali et al 2018 and aggregation of soil particles jordán et al 2010 kesik et al 2010 since most of the precipitation occurs in between july and september in the study area as thus it is expected that mulching will conserve greater moisture content and will fulfill the crop water requirements soil surface mulching also protect the soil against crusting by promoting soil stability govaerts et al 2007 and thus increase soil porosity muhammad et al 2018 and oxygen diffusion rate mulching improves the soil biotic activity of earthworms lal 2015 other soil fauna soil structure and quality up to a greater extent döring et al 2005 govaerts et al 2007 previous studies mainly focused on soil bulk density nutrient status chemical properties soil enzymes and grain yield in response to mulching techniques akhtar et al 2018a 2018b however limited information is available on crop photosynthetic rate and its relationship with soybean grain straw yield principally in semi arid region when wheat straw was used as mulching material with variable amount of n it is well known that chlorophyll is the basic material for plant photosynthesis and its quantity determine the rate of photosynthetic zhang et al 2013 the improvement of leaf photosynthetic characteristics has a significant impact on crop growth and development dry matter accumulation and final grain yield makino 2011 it was supposed that mulching will improve the soil properties and will also mineralized to provide n thus different rate of n was interactively added along with straw mulching in a three years field experiment with objectives i to clarify the trend changes of soybean net photosynthetic rate chlorophyll content dry matter accumulation root variables and yield with increasing straw mulching nitrogen rates ii to study the correlations between the photosynthetic rate and yield iii to identify the changes in soil moisture and soil temperature in response to these management alternative and its impact on seed and biomass yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site 34 12 n and 108 07 e is situated within north west china yangling shaanxi province the area is 520 m above sea level mean annual temperature and precipitation are 12 9 c and 660 mm respectively most of the precipitation occurs between july september the soil is classified as lou soils the soil nutrients and water contents were measured before the start of experiment the experimental site has soil organic carbon 1 12 available n 26 5 mg kg 1 available p 10 2 mg kg 1 available k 132 mg kg 1 total n 0 52 g kg 1 total p 0 49 g kg 1 and soil water content 8 7 mm the climatic data during growth period is presented in table 1 2 2 experimental design three wheat straw mulching treatments i e s1 0 kg ha 1 s2 3 mg ha 1 s3 6 mg ha 1 and three nitrogen rates n1 0 kg ha 1 n2 80 or 21 6 kg n ha 1 n3 100 or 27 kg n ha 1 were established since 2010 in wheat soybean rotation the experimental design was split plot with straw mulching in main plot and nitrogen rates in subplot with three replications after five years of treatments imposition in 2015 the harvested wheat residue was chopped into 3 5 cm consecutively for three years 2015 17 and mulched on soil surface the mulched wheat residue contains 0 5 n 0 1 p 1 0 k and 47 c the summer soybean glycine max l common cultivar dongdou 339 was planted at seed rate of 60 kg ha 1 on 5 june 2015 7 june 2016 and 5 june 2017 the sowing depth 5 cm was kept contestant and planting was made with no tilt planter machine the row spacing was 45 cm and plant spacing was 5 cm the plot size was 13 8 25 m the experimental field was not plowed before sowing of soybean crop diammonium phosphate dap was used as a source of nitrogen fertilizer and was applied during mid of july each year manual weeding was conducted when required during the field experiments irrigation of 120 mm was provided during mid of july each year 2 3 observations and measurements the net photosynthetic rate npr was measured by a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 li cor lincoln nebraska usa at trifold flowering initiation and pod developmental stages of soybean soybean growth variables were measured at trifold flower initiation and pod developmental stages in each plot five plants were selected and were dug out at 0 0 3 m soil layers with a soil block and keep in meshed plastic bag and to remove the soil from plant roots these bags were kept in running water for 1 h afterward the aerial and roots parts were separated at trifold flower initiation and pod developmental stages the nodules were separated from roots and were counted similarly from the stem and branches all the leaves were detached and leaf area was determined using a leaf area meter model li cor 3100 the nodules roots and aerial parts were kept in the hot air oven at 70 2 c until constant weights and dry weights were measured from the measured leaf area the leaf area index was computed as total leaf area of five plants total ground area occupied by five plants dry matter accumulation dma and crop growth rate cgr were calculated following the formula proposed by hunt 1978 the spad value index of leaf chlorophyll content were measured using a spad 502 m konicaminolta inc tokyo japan at trifold flower initiation and pods development stages schepers et al 1992 soil temperature and gravimetric soil moisture contents were determined in 0 20 cm soil layer at pod developmental stages in each plot randomly five plants were selected and were harvested for measuring yielding characteristics afterwards all pods of these five plants were counted and were averaged pods were threshed 100 seeds from each plot were counted dried in sun for four days and in oven at 70 c for two hours and weighed to record seed weight all plants from 3 5 1 5 m with a repeat of three times were harvested separately for measuring the biomass and grain yields these plants were threshed by a mechanical thresher cleaned and sun dried for four days and weighed to record grain yield and was adjusted for 14 moisture content 2 4 statistical analysis for each variable the mean values were calculated and for the comparison of different treatments an analysis of variance anova was used the means were compared by the least significant difference lsd test the statistical analyses were performed using spss 20 0 in this study straw mulching and nitrogen rates were considered as fixed and main factors year is repetitive factor while replication as random factor the interaction effects wherever founded significant were also calculated and presented 3 results 3 1 net photosynthetic rate and leaf spad value the net photosynthetic rate varied significantly among the year straw mulching and nitrogen rates table 2 the net photosynthetic rate at trifold 22 3 and 17 3 was higher in 2017 and 2016 respectively than 2015 table 2 no significant differences for net photosynthetic rate among years were noted at flowering initiation and pod formation stage of soybean table 2 wheat straw mulching improved net photosynthetic rate during trifold flowering and pod formation stages of soybean and s3 accounted for 16 7 22 0 and 14 5 respectively higher net photosynthetic rate than s1 table 2 the n3 significantly improved net photosynthetic rate by 20 6 28 0 and 5 3 than s1 during trifold flowering and pod formation stages respectively fig 1 year x nitrogen was significant for net photosynthesis at pod formation stage fig 1 the net photosynthetic rate was increased with increasing the nitrogen from 80 to 100 since 2015 2017 however wheat straw mulch x nitrogen was significant for net photosynthesis at flowering stage of soybean fig 1 increasing both mulching and nitrogen increased the net photosynthetic rates leaf spad value an index of chlorophyll was significantly affected by the years straw mulching and nitrogen rates table 2 an increase of 4 1 3 6 and 12 4 at trifold flowering and pod formations stages spad values of soybean in 2017 was noted over the 2015 however these increases for spad values in 2017 were 2 0 1 8 and 5 8 over 2016 wheat straw mulching significantly higher leaf spad value for s3 treatment compared to that of s1 during trifold 26 flowering 10 2 and pod formation 7 3 stages of soybean table 2 the leaf spad value improved by 11 1 8 4 and 18 3 by n3 than n1 during trifold flowering and pod formations stages table 2 the interaction effect of straw mulching and nitrogen was significant for leaf spad values at pod formation stage of soybean fig 2 3 1 1 relationship between photosynthesis and biomass the leaf spad value was increased with increase in straw mulching and nitrogen rates the linear fit regression analysis of net photosynthetic rate was found significant with biomass and seed yield fig 3 it was observed that with increasing the net photosynthetic rate both the biomass and seed yield increased significantly the linear fit for biomass r2 0 110 p 0 05 and for grain yield r2 0 182 p 0 01 have no good relation yet increasing the net photosynthetic rate by 6 μmol m 2 s 1 from 20 0 to 26 0 the biomass increased from 3 9 to 5 mg ha 1 and seed yield from 2 4 to 3 2 mg ha 1 this indicated that net photosynthetic rates have no linear relationship with biomass and yield as rate of net photosynthesis is also depends on a number of variables including crop stages moisture availability soil fertility and plant conditions regression analysis of spad value with biomass and seed yield showed significant increases in biomass and seed yield with increasing in spad value fig 3 the linear fit of the data directed that increasing the spad value from 32 0 to 52 0 the biomass yield increased from 3 5 to 5 6 mg ha 1 having good relationship r2 0 427 p 0 001 likewise seed yield increased from 2 1 to 3 6 mg ha 1 r2 0 575 p 0 001 this indicated stronger relationship of spad value with biomass and seed yield than net photosynthetic rate 3 2 leaf area and leaf area index the analysis of data for leaf area and leaf area index is presented in fig 4 and table 2 the years effect was significant for leaf area and leaf area index and stage wise increasing trend was observed from trifold to pod formations of soybean during 2015 2017 the leaf area and leaf area index were significantly increased in 2017 compared with that of 2016 and 2015 the s3 had significantly increased the leaf area by 46 5 24 9 and 29 4 at trifold flowering and pod formation stages of soybean respectively when compared with s1 table 2 the interaction effect of straw mulch and nitrogen was found significant on all stages for leaf area and leaf area index fig 4 increasing both straw mulch and nitrogen had significantly increased the leaf area and leaf area index significant increases in leaf area and leaf area index was observed in a trend from trifold to pod formation stage of soybean with n3 than n1 fig 4 3 3 dry matter accumulation and crop growth rate the dry matter accumulation was not affected by year straw mulching and nitrogen rates table 3 compared with 2015 and 2016 a total of 1 59 and 0 94 g plant 1 more dry matter accumulation was reported in 2017 respectively the straw mulching s3 had 2 45 and 1 35 g plant 1 greater dry matter accumulation than s2 and s1 respectively likewise an increase of 3 25 and 1 12 g plant 1 in dry matter accumulation was recorded with n3 compared n1 and n2 respectively the interaction between straw mulch and nitrogen had significantly affected the dry matter accumulation of soybean table 3 more dry matter accumulation was noted with the increase in straw mulch and nitrogen 19 0 g plant 1 additionally crop growth rate cgr was not affected by year but significantly affected by mulching and thus more cgr was recorded at s3 treatment compared with s1 table 3 likewise n3 showed maximum cgr of soybean as compared with n1 overall interactions were found not significant for cgr table 3 3 4 root weight and nodule root dry weight nodules numbers and nodules dry weight were more during 2017 compared with 2015 and 2016 table 3 a linear increase in root dry weight nodules number and weight were observed since 2015 2017 straw mulching s3 improved all root variables compared with s1 and s2 this indicating that increasing the straw mulching from 0 to 6000 kg ha 1 had significantly increased all roots variables table 3 the n fertilizer was also significant for all root variables and maximum roots dry weight 0 67 and 14 23 nodule count 11 3 and 35 5 and nodules weight 4 8 and 15 7 were measured for n3 than n1 and n2 respectively this demonstrated that increasing the n rates had increased the measured roots variables the interaction between years x straw mulching was significant for all root variables thus root variables were increased from 3 to 6 t ha 1 since 2015 2017 table 3 likewise root variables were significant between straw mulch and nitrogen table 3 increasing mulch and nitrogen rates had increased root variables whereas the interaction between years x nitrogen was significant for nodule count table 3 increasing the n rates from 80 to 100 of the recommended n for soybean had increased the nodules since 2015 to 2017 data not shown 3 5 yield and yield attributes the size of sink for carbohydrates like pods plant and 100 seed weight was significantly greater during climatically more favorable season in 2017 than drier and hotter seasons of 2015 and 2016 table 3 plants in s3 straw mulching produced significantly higher number of pods with heavier seeds than the plants grown in s1 plots without mulch likewise nitrogen fertilizer at the rate of 100 of n n3 produced higher number of pod plant 1 with significantly heavier seeds than n1 control the interaction effect of straw mulch and nitrogen was significant on yield attributes table 3 the increase in yield attributes was noted with the increase in both straw mulch and nitrogen however year x nitrogen interaction was significant for 100 seed weight table 3 the 100 seed weight increased with increasing the n application from 80 to 100 since 2015 2017 20 21 3 g soybean during 2017 produced 10 8 and 4 9 higher seed yield than 2015 and 2016 respectively likewise the biomass yield was also more during 2017 straw mulching act as a protecting layer and protect the crop from various stresses and improved seed and straw yield by 11 8 20 8 and 5 5 8 9 under s3 straw mulching compared with s2 and s1 respectively table 3 the increased seed yield by 8 4 47 9 and biomass yield by 17 5 57 1 was obtained from 100 of nitrogen treated plot compared to that of n2 80 n and n1 control respectively most of the interactions were founded significant for biomass and seed yield while the interaction between years x nitrogen was not significant for biomass yield table 2 regression curves relating seed yield response of soybean to wheat straw mulching under different n doses are shown in fig 5 seed yield showed linear relationship with straw mulch for all n rates i e 0 80 100 n fertilization seed yield increased continuously with increasing straw mulching from 0 to 6 mg ha 1 during 2015 to 2017 in climatically favorable seasons the linear fit of n3 r2 0 688 n2 r2 0 995 n1 r2 0 998 however in other drier period the linear fit of n2 r2 0 913 was better than n3 r2 0 905 during 2015 fig 5 3 6 soil moisture content and temperature soil water content fluctuates during summer soybean 2015 2017 seasons fig 6 soil water content was 21 7 and 33 7 more in 2017 season than 2015 and 2016 seasons respectively straw mulched plots of s3 had enhanced the soil water content up to 7 4 and 2 7 than s1 and s2 treatments respectively this showed that moisture contents were more with the addition of more straw input similarly increasing the nitrogen rates had significantly increased the soil moisture content the n3 had maximum water contents 12 6 when compared to control 12 1 likewise soil temperature showed an increased to decreasing trends during summer soybean 2015 2017 seasons fig 6 the soil temperature was 1 9 and 2 5 lower at pod formation stage during 2017 when compared to 2015 and 2016 respectively similarly straw mulching at s3 level had decreased 3 0 soil temperature as compared to no mulched plots additionally decreasing trend in soil temperature was observed from unfertilized to fertilized plots however the changes were found non significant between n1 and n2 regimes all the interactions were found significant for soil moisture and temperature the fig 6 showed that the straw mulch x nitrogen interaction was significantly affected on soil moisture but not significantly affected on soil temperature soil moisture increased and soil temperature was decreased with the increase in the rate of straw mulching and nitrogen since 2015 to 2017 the relationship of biomass with soil moisture and temperature was found significant fig 7 it was noted that increasing the soil moisture both the biomass and grain yield increased significantly the linear fit was not very good for biomass r2 0 328 p 0 001 and somehow acceptable for grain yield r2 0 491 p 0 001 however increasing the soil moisture by 1 6 from 11 2 to 12 8 the biomass increased by 1 5 times and grain yield by 2 times regression analysis of soil temperature with biomass and seed yield indicated that increasing the soil temperature the biomass and seed yield decreased significantly the linear fit of the data indicated that increasing the soil temperature from 21 3 to 22 2 c the biomass yield decreased from 5 to 4 1 mg ha 1 having a weak relationship r2 0 128 p 0 03 however the seed yield decreased from 3 2 to 2 3 mg ha 1 r2 0 253 p 0 004 this suggesting weaker relationship of temperature with biomass and seed yield than soil moisture 4 discussion 4 1 year effects the year was considered as repetitive variable for conformity of the data and its trends however the changing pattern of climatic perturbation like changes in seasonal rainfall had changes the soil moisture and temperature these changes had caused variation to physiological growth and yield parameters of soybean during 2017 growing season of soybean received 607 3 mm of rainfall higher than 2015 286 9 mm and 2016 314 3 mm similarly the maximum 30 2 c and minimum 20 5 c temperature during 2017 was relatively optimum for growth when compared to the maximum and minimum temperature during 2016 20 7 27 1 c and 2015 20 0 26 6 c respectively likewise the soil water content at 0 20 cm soil layer was 2 6 and 3 7 higher in the wetter growing season of 2017 than in the drier seasons of 2015 and 2016 years respectively in contrast the soil temperature in 2017 was 2 46 and 1 93 lower than 2016 and 2015 respectively all these supportive and optimum soil and climatic parameters had significantly increased the seed yield in 2017 by 10 8 and 4 9 than dry spell years of 2015 and 2016 respectively the long dry spell was noted during growing season 2016 at flowering and pod formation stages resulted in soil moisture depletion to nearly to wilting point in the 0 20 cm layer the distribution of rainfall in 2017 was uniform which leads to better soil moisture availability and have facilitated the retention of nutrients and thus ultimately increased the crop growth misra and tyler 1999 leaf net photosynthesis spad values which indirectly reveal plants n and chlorophyll contents were significantly higher during 2017 these enhancement in chlorophyll and photosynthesis ookawa et al 2003 caused greater leaf area and leaf area index and thus more dry matter was accumulated for large sizes of seed and finally increased the total seed yield enhancement in dry matter production also enhanced root growth and nodules formation table 2 in the current study root growth in the form of dry root weight and number and size of nodules borne on these roots were greater in 2017 than 2015 and 2016 which might have indirectly increased the crop growth and seed yield 4 2 straw mulching effects the addition of straw mulch was hypothesized that it will increase the soil moisture and reduces soil temperature for soybean from the results it was confirmed that increasing the mulching amount improved soil and plant parameters table 2 3 likewise the straw mulching had beneficially affected nearly all plant variables and the effects were founded statistically significant the induced moisture and heat stress of the straw mulching addition can be considered a transformed importance of mulching in view of climate change in the present study the net photosynthesis spad values leaf area and leaf area index at trifold flowering and pod formation stage were significantly higher in plots where full mulching treatments was used compared to no mulching this improved plant performance is associated with improved soil moisture regimes and nutrient availability muhammad et al 2018 sekhon et al 2005 the increase in soil moisture results in favorable plant growth and higher chlorophyll content net photosynthetic rate which ultimately increase the crop performance i e improvement in leaf area leaf area index dry matter accumulation root variables yield attributes and crop yield it is documented that increases in water regimes and decreases in soil temperature increase the soybean yield by 4 4 68 3 sekhon et al 2005 such increases in nutrient uptake and yield of soybean was further confirmed by addition of crop residue karunakaran 2011 the mechanism for improved yield and physiology of soybean is related to higher moisture content and lower temperature of the soil particularly at s3 which was close to the field capacity and suitable for optimum crop growth siczek and lipiec 2009 the results confirmed that under wet soil conditions nodules were larger compared under water deficient condition king and purcell 2001 the improvement of nodules and root growth of soybean was recorded in mulched treated plots s3 than s2 and s1 treated plots and this may be due to the reduction in soil temperature fluctuations karunakaran 2011 additionally researchers reported that mulching is favorable for seedling emergence root proliferation and good nodulations albright et al 1989 siczek and lipiec 2009 and hence can increase the crop growth and yield 4 3 nitrogen effects greater leaf area between trifold and full pod stages of soybean is important to enhance photosynthetic rate kumudini et al 2001 our results showed that lai yielding attributes and crop yield is linearly improved with increasing n rates caliskan et al 2008 founded that n had significant effects on lai biomass net photosynthetic rate and spad value at r4 stage our results also indicated that addition of n significantly improved lai biomass physiology root variables net photosynthetic rate and spad value at trifold stage of soybean this could be attributed to amount of n application to plant during trifold stage our results disagree with the findings of caliskan et al 2008 that often low n have less or negligible effects on plant parameter caliskan et al 2008 it was further observed that leaf area biomass growth root variables or net photosynthetic rate increased with increasing rate of n fertilizer our findings are supported by caliskan et al 2008 that leaf area and biomass increased with photosynthetic characteristics of soybean which increased with nitrogen our experimental results revealed that n fertilization at early reproductive stage is more important to increase early growth root growth nodule and finally yield of soybean in semi arid region of china than latter stages such findings were reported by earlier researchers gan et al 2004 we have not only observed the yield and biomass improvement with early n fertilization but have also observed increases in net photosynthetic rates root mass and nodule numbers which all were positively correlated with seed and biomass yield most of plant observations physiology growth and yield of soybean increased with increasing n suggesting that nitrogen fertilizer is important factor for improving crop growth and yield of soybean gao et al 2009 or winter wheat abad et al 2004 the increase n had not only increased the plant parameter but improved the soil moisture and temperature with full rate of n than control in the rained conditions n fertilization showed weaker response to nutrient uptake than irrigated regimes ghosh et al 2016 kumari et al 2013 therefore the addition of straw mulching and full rate increased the moisture and can be used as a viable technology for soybean productivity in rained condition some previous studies indicated that high dose of n fertilization at early sowing time was harmful on nodulation infection and nitrogen capacity of bradyrhizobium bacteria koutroubas et al 1998 some researchers suggested that n fertilization is not necessary for inoculated soybean barker and sawyer 2005 sogut 2006 whereas others indicated that biological n fixation is not adequate to meet the n demand of the crop and n fertilization is necessary to improve yield and quality of soybean depending on application time or rate osborne and riedell 2006 ray et al 2006 however we did recorded the nodules at early growth stages with different n fertilization 0 80 and 100 of n and founded that with straw mulching nodules was increased with 80 n but did not negatively affected by 100 n when compared to control plots during early growth period 4 4 straw mulching x nitrogen interaction in the current study the interaction between straw mulch x nitrogen was mostly significant for measured parameters this suggests that both mulching residue and n treatments have strong relationship in the semi arid region of china the mulching had improved the soil moisture and thus the availability of n fertilizer might have improved the plant performance in other words it can be stated that alone usage of either straw or n is not a good option for increasing yield of crop in semi arid regions of china these data are supported by earlier researchers tilander and bonzi 1997 who reported that increased in soil moisture or declined soil temperatures due straw mulch did not always improve sorghum yield because nutrients deficiency is more limiting factor than water therefore the reduction of yield in straw mulching treatments could be due to the low nutrient availability that occurred when soil was covered with mulch materials unger 1986 additionally döring et al 2005 reported that due to no n input potato yield was not significantly affected by straw mulching therefore the present results indicated that straw mulching had a greater prospective to increase soybean yield only if nitrogen is added 5 conclusions the application of straw mulching 6 t ha 1 improved the soil hydrothermal properties by increasing the moisture content and decreasing soil temperature these improved soil hydrothermal properties provided more favorable conditions for plant growth when 100 nitrogen fertilization was made most of the plant physiological measurements net photosynthesis rates spad values leaf area lai roots seed and biomass weight were increased with both full rate of mulching and n but roots nodules number and weights were increased with 6 t ha 1 mulching and 80 of n fertilization straw mulching and n fertilization will be beneficial for improved growth performance coupled with reduced heat stress and provision of moisture in semi arid regions of the china this management model in the semi arid regions will have immense advantage to environment protection due to reuse of crop residues rather than their burning acknowledgments this work was supported by

11280,in north west china the soybean glycine max l merr is grown in june when the climate is dry and soil has limited moisture contents moisture deficiency limits the soybean biomass we studied the effects of wheat straw mulching and nitrogen on soybean growth physiology and soil properties in three year field experiments the treatments included three straw mulching i e s1 0 kg ha 1 s2 3000 kg ha 1 and s3 6000 kg ha 1 and three nitrogen rates i e n1 0 kg n ha 1 n2 21 6 kg n ha 1 and n3 27 kg n ha 1 full mulching s3 significantly increased moisture retention 7 4 and decrease soil temperature 3 0 in 0 20 cm soil depth increased photosynthesis spad value leaf area leaf area index growth and soybean grain yield 20 8 over no mulching s1 the s3 improved the roots mass nodules number and weight than s1 the application of 27 kg n ha 1 or 100 n fertilizer n3 had significantly increased photosynthesis spad value growth and biomass and seed yield of soybean over no n application n1 it was concluded that using straw mulching 6 mg ha 1 can change the soil hydrothermal regime for provision of favorable condition for soybean growth when 27 kg n ha 1 was used in semi arid condition of north west china keywords crop physiology soil moisture crop yield soybean 1 introduction soybean glycine max l merr is one of the important edible and oilseed crops of china it is mostly grown in water deficient and marginal land in most parts of the world soybean beside soil fertility improvement also has valuable nutritional values for human being likewise it contributes 48 2 60 to the world oilseed acreage usda 2016 it fix about 50 300 kg n ha 1 in a year representing a major contribution keyser and li 1992 during 2014 15 soybean was globally cultivated on 118 2 million hectares of land having average production of 2699 kg ha 1 and grain yield 319 million tones usda 2016 soybean is a n fixing crop thus requires less n fertilizer however in north west china excessive n fertilizers are used for most of the crops li et al 2008 the average usage of n fertilizer 450 kg ha 1 had increased the chance of nitrate pollution of the ground water in the irrigated areas of north west china li et al 2005 this nitrate leaching was around 227 kg no3 n ha 1 in 0 90 cm soil layer at crop harvest stage cui et al 2006 and expecting to be increase with future n application thus n fertilization is widely accepted as a source of water pollution but at the same time it is needed for mineral n availability for the plants in a variety ecosystem of the world khan et al 2018 it was evident from the long term excessive use of n fertilization that excess use or long term application of n caused accumulation of residual n in north china fan et al 2003 ju et al 2006 therefore recently more discussing and important issue is the n cycling in agro ecosystem and need more consideration from scientists in china chuan et al 2015 the use of crop residues as mulching materials is an important management tools to pose positive effects on soil and crop growth akhtar et al 2018a b surface straw mulching retained more rain water and also had positive response on soil water content by controlling evaporation loss ali et al 2018 ghosh et al 2006 and hence decreased the soil temperature due to low thermal conductivity ali et al 2018 and aggregation of soil particles jordán et al 2010 kesik et al 2010 since most of the precipitation occurs in between july and september in the study area as thus it is expected that mulching will conserve greater moisture content and will fulfill the crop water requirements soil surface mulching also protect the soil against crusting by promoting soil stability govaerts et al 2007 and thus increase soil porosity muhammad et al 2018 and oxygen diffusion rate mulching improves the soil biotic activity of earthworms lal 2015 other soil fauna soil structure and quality up to a greater extent döring et al 2005 govaerts et al 2007 previous studies mainly focused on soil bulk density nutrient status chemical properties soil enzymes and grain yield in response to mulching techniques akhtar et al 2018a 2018b however limited information is available on crop photosynthetic rate and its relationship with soybean grain straw yield principally in semi arid region when wheat straw was used as mulching material with variable amount of n it is well known that chlorophyll is the basic material for plant photosynthesis and its quantity determine the rate of photosynthetic zhang et al 2013 the improvement of leaf photosynthetic characteristics has a significant impact on crop growth and development dry matter accumulation and final grain yield makino 2011 it was supposed that mulching will improve the soil properties and will also mineralized to provide n thus different rate of n was interactively added along with straw mulching in a three years field experiment with objectives i to clarify the trend changes of soybean net photosynthetic rate chlorophyll content dry matter accumulation root variables and yield with increasing straw mulching nitrogen rates ii to study the correlations between the photosynthetic rate and yield iii to identify the changes in soil moisture and soil temperature in response to these management alternative and its impact on seed and biomass yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental

the mulched wheat residue contains 0 5 n 0 1 p 1 0 k and 47 c the summer soybean glycine max l common cultivar dongdou 339 was planted at seed rate of 60 kg ha 1 on 5 june 2015 7 june 2016 and 5 june 2017 the sowing depth 5 cm was kept contestant and planting was made with no tilt planter machine the row spacing was 45 cm and plant spacing was 5 cm the plot size was 13 8 25 m the experimental field was not plowed before sowing of soybean crop diammonium phosphate dap was used as a source of nitrogen fertilizer and was applied during mid of july each year manual weeding was conducted when required during the field experiments irrigation of 120 mm was provided during mid of july each year 2 3 observations and measurements the net photosynthetic rate npr was measured by a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 li cor lincoln nebraska usa at trifold flowering initiation and pod developmental stages of soybean soybean growth variables were measured at trifold flower initiation and pod developmental stages in each plot five plants were selected and were dug out at 0 0 3 m soil layers with a soil block and keep in meshed plastic bag and to remove the soil from plant roots these bags were kept in running water for 1 h afterward the aerial and roots parts were separated at trifold flower initiation and pod developmental stages the nodules were separated from roots and were counted similarly from the stem and branches all the leaves were detached and leaf area was determined using a leaf area meter model li cor 3100 the nodules roots and aerial parts were kept in the hot air oven at 70 2 c until constant weights and dry weights were measured from the measured leaf area the leaf area index was computed as total leaf area of five plants total ground area occupied by five plants dry matter accumulation dma and crop growth rate cgr were calculated following the formula proposed by hunt 1978 the spad value index of leaf chlorophyll content were measured using a spad 502 m konicaminolta inc tokyo japan at trifold flower initiation and pods development stages schepers et al 1992 soil temperature and gravimetric soil moisture contents were determined in 0 20 cm soil layer at pod developmental stages in each plot randomly five plants were selected and were harvested for measuring yielding characteristics afterwards all pods of these five plants were counted and were averaged pods were threshed 100 seeds from each plot were counted dried in sun for four days and in oven at 70 c for two hours and weighed to record seed weight all plants from 3 5 1 5 m with a repeat of three times were harvested separately for measuring the biomass and grain yields these plants were threshed by a mechanical thresher cleaned and sun dried for four days and weighed to record grain yield and was adjusted for 14 moisture content 2 4 statistical analysis for each variable the mean values were calculated and for the comparison of different treatments an analysis of variance anova was used the means were compared by the least significant difference lsd test the statistical analyses were performed using spss 20 0 in this study straw mulching and nitrogen rates were considered as fixed and main factors year is repetitive factor while replication as random factor the interaction effects wherever founded significant were also calculated and presented 3 results 3 1 net photosynthetic rate and leaf spad value the net photosynthetic rate varied significantly among the year straw mulching and nitrogen rates table 2 the net photosynthetic rate at trifold 22 3 and 17 3 was higher in 2017 and 2016 respectively than 2015 table 2 no significant differences for net photosynthetic rate among years were noted at flowering initiation and pod formation stage of soybean table 2 wheat straw mulching improved net photosynthetic rate during trifold flowering and pod formation stages of soybean and s3 accounted for 16 7 22 0 and 14 5 respectively higher net photosynthetic rate than s1 table 2 the n3 significantly improved net photosynthetic rate by 20 6 28 0 and 5 3 than s1 during trifold flowering and pod formation stages respectively fig 1 year x nitrogen was significant for net photosynthesis at pod formation stage fig 1 the net photosynthetic rate was increased with increasing the nitrogen from 80 to 100 since 2015 2017 however wheat straw mulch x nitrogen was significant for net photosynthesis at flowering stage of soybean fig 1 increasing both mulching and nitrogen increased the net photosynthetic rates leaf spad value an index of chlorophyll was significantly affected by the years straw mulching and nitrogen rates table 2 an increase of 4 1 3 6 and 12 4 at trifold flowering and pod formations stages spad values of soybean in 2017 was noted over the 2015 however these increases for spad values in 2017 were 2 0 1 8 and 5 8 over 2016 wheat straw mulching significantly higher leaf spad value for s3 treatment compared to that of s1 during trifold 26 flowering 10 2 and pod formation 7 3 stages of soybean table 2 the leaf spad value improved by 11 1 8 4 and 18 3 by n3 than n1 during trifold flowering and pod formations stages table 2 the interaction effect of straw mulching and nitrogen was significant for leaf spad values at pod formation stage of soybean fig 2 3 1 1 relationship between photosynthesis and biomass the leaf spad value was increased with increase in straw mulching and nitrogen rates the linear fit regression analysis of net photosynthetic rate was found significant with biomass and seed yield fig 3 it was observed that with increasing the net photosynthetic rate both the biomass and seed yield increased significantly the linear fit for biomass r2 0 110 p 0 05 and for grain yield r2 0 182 p 0 01 have no good relation yet increasing the net photosynthetic rate by 6 μmol m 2 s 1 from 20 0 to 26 0 the biomass increased from 3 9 to 5 mg ha 1 and seed yield from 2 4 to 3 2 mg ha 1 this indicated that net photosynthetic rates have no linear relationship with biomass and yield as rate of net photosynthesis is also depends on a number of variables including crop stages moisture availability soil fertility and plant conditions regression analysis of spad value with biomass and seed yield showed significant increases in biomass and seed yield with increasing in spad value fig 3 the linear fit of the data directed that increasing the spad value from 32 0 to 52 0 the biomass yield increased from 3 5 to 5 6 mg ha 1 having good relationship r2 0 427 p 0 001 likewise seed yield increased from 2 1 to 3 6 mg ha 1 r2 0 575 p 0 001 this indicated stronger relationship of spad value with biomass and seed yield than net photosynthetic rate 3 2 leaf area and leaf area index the analysis of data for leaf area and leaf area index is presented in fig 4 and table 2 the years effect was significant for leaf area and leaf area index and stage wise increasing trend was observed from trifold to pod formations of soybean during 2015 2017 the leaf area and leaf area index were significantly increased in 2017 compared with that of 2016 and 2015 the s3 had significantly increased the leaf area by 46 5 24 9 and 29 4 at trifold flowering and pod formation stages of soybean respectively when compared with s1 table 2 the interaction effect of straw mulch and nitrogen was found significant on all stages for leaf area and leaf area index fig 4 increasing both straw mulch and nitrogen had significantly increased the leaf area and leaf area index significant increases in leaf area and leaf area index was observed in a trend from trifold to pod formation stage of soybean with n3 than n1 fig 4 3 3 dry matter accumulation and crop growth rate the dry matter accumulation was not affected by year straw mulching and nitrogen rates table 3 compared with 2015 and 2016 a total of 1 59 and 0 94 g plant 1 more dry matter accumulation was reported in 2017 respectively the straw mulching s3 had 2 45 and 1 35 g plant 1 greater dry matter accumulation than s2 and s1 respectively likewise an increase of 3 25 and 1 12 g plant 1 in dry matter accumulation was recorded with n3 compared n1 and n2 respectively the interaction between straw mulch and nitrogen had significantly affected the dry matter accumulation of soybean table 3 more dry matter accumulation was noted with the increase in straw mulch and nitrogen 19 0 g plant 1 additionally crop growth rate cgr was not affected by year but significantly affected by mulching and thus more cgr was recorded at s3 treatment compared with s1 table 3 likewise n3 showed maximum cgr of soybean as compared with n1 overall interactions were found not significant for cgr table 3 3 4 root weight and nodule root dry weight nodules numbers and nodules dry weight were more during 2017 compared with 2015 and 2016 table 3 a linear increase in root dry weight nodules number and weight were observed since 2015 2017 straw mulching s3 improved all root variables compared with s1 and s2 this indicating that increasing the straw mulching from 0 to 6000 kg ha 1 had significantly increased all roots variables table 3 the n fertilizer was also significant for all root variables and maximum roots dry weight 0 67 and 14 23 nodule count 11 3 and 35 5 and nodules weight 4 8 and 15 7 were measured for n3 than n1 and n2 respectively this demonstrated that increasing the n rates had increased the measured roots variables the interaction between years x straw mulching was significant for all root variables thus root variables were increased from 3 to 6 t ha 1 since 2015 2017 table 3 likewise root variables were significant between straw mulch and nitrogen table 3 increasing mulch and nitrogen rates had increased root variables whereas the interaction between years x nitrogen was significant for nodule count table 3 increasing the n rates from 80 to 100 of the recommended n for soybean had increased the nodules since 2015 to 2017 data not shown 3 5 yield and yield attributes the size of sink for carbohydrates like pods plant and 100 seed weight was significantly greater during climatically more favorable season in 2017 than drier and hotter seasons of 2015 and 2016 table 3 plants in s3 straw mulching produced significantly higher number of pods with heavier seeds than the plants grown in s1 plots without mulch likewise nitrogen fertilizer at the rate of 100 of n n3 produced higher number of pod plant 1 with significantly heavier seeds than n1 control the interaction effect of straw mulch and nitrogen was significant on yield attributes table 3 the increase in yield attributes was noted with the increase in both straw mulch and nitrogen however year x nitrogen interaction was significant for 100 seed weight table 3 the 100 seed weight increased with increasing the n application from 80 to 100 since 2015 2017 20 21 3 g soybean during 2017 produced 10 8 and 4 9 higher seed yield than 2015 and 2016 respectively likewise the biomass yield was also more during 2017 straw mulching act as a protecting layer and protect the crop from various stresses and improved seed and straw yield by 11 8 20 8 and 5 5 8 9 under s3 straw mulching compared with s2 and s1 respectively table 3 the increased seed yield by 8 4 47 9 and biomass yield by 17 5 57 1 was obtained from 100 of nitrogen treated plot compared to that of n2 80 n and n1 control respectively most of the interactions were founded significant for biomass and seed yield while the interaction between years x nitrogen was not significant for biomass yield table 2 regression curves relating seed yield response of soybean to wheat straw mulching under different n doses are shown in fig 5 seed yield showed linear relationship with straw mulch for all n rates i e 0 80 100 n fertilization seed yield increased continuously with increasing straw mulching from 0 to 6 mg ha 1 during 2015 to 2017 in climatically favorable seasons the linear fit of n3 r2 0 688 n2 r2 0 995 n1 r2 0 998 however in other drier period the linear fit of n2 r2 0 913 was better than n3 r2 0 905 during 2015 fig 5 3 6 soil moisture content and temperature soil water content fluctuates during summer soybean 2015 2017 seasons fig 6 soil water content was 21 7 and 33 7 more in 2017 season than 2015 and 2016 seasons respectively straw mulched plots of s3 had enhanced the soil water content up to 7 4 and 2 7 than s1 and s2 treatments respectively this showed that moisture contents were more with the addition of more straw input similarly increasing the nitrogen rates had significantly increased the soil moisture content the n3 had maximum water contents 12 6 when compared to control 12 1 likewise soil temperature showed an increased to decreasing trends during summer soybean 2015 2017 seasons fig 6 the soil temperature was 1 9 and 2 5 lower at pod formation stage during 2017 when compared to 2015 and 2016 respectively similarly straw mulching at s3 level had decreased 3 0 soil temperature as compared to no mulched plots additionally decreasing trend in soil temperature was observed from unfertilized to fertilized plots however the changes were found non significant between n1 and n2 regimes all the interactions were found significant for soil moisture and temperature the fig 6 showed that the straw mulch x nitrogen interaction was significantly affected on soil moisture but not significantly affected on soil temperature soil moisture increased and soil temperature was decreased with the increase in the rate of straw mulching and nitrogen since 2015 to 2017 the relationship of biomass with soil moisture and temperature was found significant fig 7 it was noted that increasing the soil moisture both the biomass and grain yield increased significantly the linear fit was not very good for biomass r2 0 328 p 0 001 and somehow acceptable for grain yield r2 0 491 p 0 001 however increasing the soil moisture by 1 6 from 11 2 to 12 8 the biomass increased by 1 5 times and grain yield by 2 times regression analysis of soil temperature with biomass and seed yield indicated that increasing the soil temperature the biomass and seed yield decreased significantly the linear fit of the data indicated that increasing the soil temperature from 21 3 to 22 2 c the biomass yield decreased from 5 to 4 1 mg ha 1 having a weak relationship r2 0 128 p 0 03 however the seed yield decreased from 3 2 to 2 3 mg ha 1 r2 0 253 p 0 004 this suggesting weaker relationship of temperature with biomass and seed yield than soil moisture 4 discussion 4 1 year effects the year was considered as repetitive variable for conformity of the data and its trends however the changing pattern of climatic perturbation like changes in seasonal rainfall had changes the soil moisture and temperature these changes had caused variation to physiological growth and yield parameters of soybean during 2017 growing season of soybean received 607 3 mm of rainfall higher than 2015 286 9 mm and 2016 314 3 mm similarly the maximum 30 2 c and minimum 20 5 c temperature during 2017 was relatively optimum for growth when compared to the maximum and minimum temperature during 2016 20 7 27 1 c and 2015 20 0 26 6 c respectively likewise the soil water content at 0 20 cm soil layer was 2 6 and 3 7 higher in the wetter growing season of 2017 than in the drier seasons of 2015 and 2016 years respectively in contrast the soil temperature in 2017 was 2 46 and 1 93 lower than 2016 and 2015 respectively all these supportive and optimum soil and climatic parameters had significantly increased the seed yield in 2017 by 10 8 and 4 9 than dry spell years of 2015 and 2016 respectively the long dry spell was noted during growing season 2016 at flowering and pod formation stages resulted in soil moisture depletion to nearly to wilting point in the 0 20 cm layer the distribution of rainfall in 2017 was uniform which leads to better soil moisture availability and have facilitated the retention of nutrients and thus ultimately increased the crop growth misra and tyler 1999 leaf net photosynthesis spad values which indirectly reveal plants n and chlorophyll contents were significantly higher during 2017 these enhancement in chlorophyll and photosynthesis ookawa et al 2003 caused greater leaf area and leaf area index and thus more dry matter was accumulated for large sizes of seed and finally increased the total seed yield enhancement in dry matter production also enhanced root growth and nodules formation table 2 in the current study root growth in the form of dry root weight and number and size of nodules borne on these roots were greater in 2017 than 2015 and 2016 which might have indirectly increased the crop growth and seed yield 4 2 straw mulching effects the addition of straw mulch was hypothesized that it will increase the soil moisture and reduces soil temperature for soybean from the results it was confirmed that increasing the mulching amount improved soil and plant parameters table 2 3 likewise the straw mulching had beneficially affected nearly all plant variables and the effects were founded statistically significant the induced moisture and heat stress of the straw mulching addition can be considered a transformed importance of mulching in view of climate change in the present study the net photosynthesis spad values leaf area and leaf area index at trifold flowering and pod formation stage were significantly higher in plots where full mulching treatments was used compared to no mulching this improved plant performance is associated with improved soil moisture regimes and nutrient availability muhammad et al 2018 sekhon et al 2005 the increase in soil moisture results in favorable plant growth and higher chlorophyll content net photosynthetic rate which ultimately increase the crop performance i e improvement in leaf area leaf area index dry matter accumulation root variables yield attributes and crop yield it is documented that increases in water regimes and decreases in soil temperature increase the soybean yield by 4 4 68 3 sekhon et al 2005 such increases in nutrient uptake and yield of soybean was further confirmed by addition of crop residue karunakaran 2011 the mechanism for improved yield and physiology of soybean is related to higher moisture content and lower temperature of the soil particularly at s3 which was close to the field capacity and suitable for optimum crop growth siczek and lipiec 2009 the results confirmed that under wet soil conditions nodules were larger compared under water deficient condition king and purcell 2001 the improvement of nodules and root growth of soybean was recorded in mulched treated plots s3 than s2 and s1 treated plots and this may be due to the reduction in soil temperature fluctuations karunakaran 2011 additionally researchers reported that mulching is favorable for seedling emergence root proliferation and good nodulations albright et al 1989 siczek and lipiec 2009 and hence can increase the crop growth and yield 4 3 nitrogen effects greater leaf area between trifold and full pod stages of soybean is important to enhance photosynthetic rate kumudini et al 2001 our results showed that lai yielding attributes and crop yield is linearly improved with increasing n rates caliskan et al 2008 founded that n had significant effects on lai biomass net photosynthetic rate and spad value at r4 stage our results also indicated that addition of n significantly improved lai biomass physiology root variables net photosynthetic rate and spad value at trifold stage of soybean this could be attributed to amount of n application to plant during trifold stage our results disagree with the findings of caliskan et al 2008 that often low n have less or negligible effects on plant parameter caliskan et al 2008 it was further observed that leaf area biomass growth root variables or net photosynthetic rate increased with increasing rate of n fertilizer our findings are supported by caliskan et al 2008 that leaf area and biomass increased with photosynthetic characteristics of soybean which increased with nitrogen our experimental results revealed that n fertilization at early reproductive stage is more important to increase early growth root growth nodule and finally yield of soybean in semi arid region of china than latter stages such findings were reported by earlier researchers gan et al 2004 we have not only observed the yield and biomass improvement with early n fertilization but have also observed increases in net photosynthetic rates root mass and nodule numbers which all were positively correlated with seed and biomass yield most of plant observations physiology growth and yield of soybean increased with increasing n suggesting that nitrogen fertilizer is important factor for improving crop growth and yield of soybean gao et al 2009 or winter wheat abad et al 2004 the increase n had not only increased the plant parameter but improved the soil moisture and temperature with full rate of n than control in the rained conditions n fertilization showed weaker response to nutrient uptake than irrigated regimes ghosh et al 2016 kumari et al 2013 therefore the addition of straw mulching and full rate increased the moisture and can be used as a viable technology for soybean productivity in rained condition some previous studies indicated that high dose of n fertilization at early sowing time was harmful on nodulation infection and nitrogen capacity of bradyrhizobium bacteria koutroubas et al 1998 some researchers suggested that n fertilization is not necessary for inoculated soybean barker and sawyer 2005 sogut 2006 whereas others indicated that biological n fixation is not adequate to meet the n demand of the crop and n fertilization is necessary to improve yield and quality of soybean depending on application time or rate osborne and riedell 2006 ray et al 2006 however we did recorded the nodules at early growth stages with different n fertilization 0 80 and 100 of n and founded that with straw mulching nodules was increased with 80 n but did not negatively affected by 100 n when compared to control plots during early growth period 4 4 straw mulching x nitrogen interaction in the current study the interaction between straw mulch x nitrogen was mostly significant for measured parameters this suggests that both mulching residue and n treatments have strong relationship in the semi arid region of china the mulching had improved the soil moisture and thus the availability of n fertilizer might have improved the plant performance in other words it can be stated that alone usage of either straw or n is not a good option for increasing yield of crop in semi arid regions of china these data are supported by earlier researchers tilander and bonzi 1997 who reported that increased in soil moisture or declined soil temperatures due straw mulch did not always improve sorghum yield because nutrients deficiency is more limiting factor than water therefore the reduction of yield in straw mulching treatments could be due to the low nutrient availability that occurred when soil was covered with mulch materials unger 1986 additionally döring et al 2005 reported that due to no n input potato yield was not significantly affected by straw mulching therefore the present results indicated that straw mulching had a greater prospective to increase soybean yield only if nitrogen is added 5 conclusions the application of straw mulching 6 t ha 1 improved the soil hydrothermal properties by increasing the moisture content and decreasing soil temperature these improved soil hydrothermal properties provided more favorable conditions for plant growth when 100 nitrogen fertilization was made most of the plant physiological measurements net photosynthesis rates spad values leaf area lai roots seed and biomass weight were increased with both full rate of mulching and n but roots nodules number and weights were increased with 6 t ha 1 mulching and 80 of n fertilization straw mulching and n fertilization will be beneficial for improved growth performance coupled with reduced heat stress and provision of moisture in semi arid regions of the china this management model in the semi arid regions will have immense advantage to environment protection due to reuse of crop residues rather than their burning acknowledgments this work was supported by

11281,agricultural soil is a major source of n2o and no in this study we tested whether optimized n fertigation and water saving irrigation methods could improve nutrient and water use efficiency while maintaining productivity in the intensified farmed winter wheat triticum aestivum l summer maize zea mays l cropping system of northern china a field experiment was conducted to test different flood irrigation fn600 conventional n fertilization of 600 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and flood irrigation fn0 no n input and flood irrigation and drip fertigation n0 no n input and drip irrigation n420 optimized n fertilization of 420 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and drip irrigation n600 conventional n fertilization of 600 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and drip irrigation treatments compared with the fn600 treatment the n600 treatment reduced water use by 62 5 wheat season and 36 4 maize season the n600 treatment significantly reduced n2o emissions by 19 9 during the maize season but not during the wheat season the n600 treatment increased no emissions by 20 9 and 11 0 during the wheat and maize seasons respectively compared with the n600 treatment the n420 treatment significantly decreased n2o and no emissions by 21 8 and 29 8 respectively during the wheat season and by 31 5 and 41 6 respectively during the maize season while achieving higher crop yield the direct emission factors ratio of the cumulative n2o or no emissions of fertilized treatment minus ck to n rate of n2o and no were 0 19 0 25 and 0 21 0 27 for the wheat season and 0 38 0 63 and 0 34 0 42 for the maize season respectively optimal fertilization n420 significantly increased the water use efficiency intrinsic water use efficiency partial factor productivity and apparent nitrogen use efficiency in both the wheat and the maize seasons in addition to nitrification nitrifier denitrification contributed to the generation and diffusion of n2o and no especially during the summer maize season considering the higher productivity more efficient use of irrigation water and nitrogen and lower n2o and no emissions drip irrigation combined with optimized n fertilization is recommended in northern china keywords n2o no optimized fertilization drip irrigation nitrifier denitrification water pricing 1 introduction globally agricultural soils contribute approximately 67 and 18 of total anthropogenic n2o and no emissions respectively reay et al 2012 gaihre et al 2015 total fertilized cropland annually emits 1 7 4 8 tg of n2o n and 1 6 8 9 tg of no n ipcc 2007 cui et al 2012 yao et al 2017 accordingly it is important to mitigate n2o and no emissions through optimized farming practices in agricultural sectors drip irrigation combined with dissolved n fertilizer fertigation which provides an appropriate amount of n and water to crop roots in a more precise and timely manner than does broadcast fertilization has been confirmed to be an efficient method of irrigation and fertilization abalos et al 2014 farneselli et al 2015 many studies have shown that drip fertigation can decrease n losses badr et al 2012 koocheki et al 2014 and reduce transformable n to n2o and or no maris et al 2015 wang et al 2016a reported a significant reduction 14 6 of n2o in the winter wheat season under drip irrigation compared with flood irrigation however tian et al 2016 found that drip fertigation reduced n2o emissions by 7 7 but increased no emissions by 21 7 during the summer maize season these findings indicated that edaphic properties climate conditions and farming practices may exert different effects on soil n2o and no emissions barnard et al 2005 deppe et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 northern china one of the most intensified agricultural regions in china produced 67 and 28 of the nation s wheat triticum aestivum l and maize zea mays l respectively in 2014 nbsc 2015 various sound farming practices have been implemented to reduce fertilizer n and water inputs and maintain the high crop yield in this region since the 1990s zhang et al 2011 the fertilizer n efficiency in the region has been reported to be 30 for maize and wheat miao et al 2011 the reported proportions of n losses from applied fertilizers via nitrification and denitrification range from 0 9 to 10 9 zhang et al 2008 ju et al 2009 such gaseous n losses including nh3 exert potential pressure on the aquatic environment chien et al 2009 and air quality xu et al 2016 and contribute to regional and global greenhouse gas emissions zhang et al 2017 in northern china agriculture is dependent on pumping deep groundwater for irrigation and irrigation water accounts for 80 of total water use in the region deng et al 2006 as a result the groundwater level is declining rapidly at a rate of 0 8 m yr 1 in this region fang et al 2010 heavy irrigation has also increased no3 leaching from cropland deng et al 2006 resulting in the entry of no3 to deeper profiles after which it infiltrates groundwater or is permanently lost from the system currell et al 2012 optimizing fertilization and irrigation by methods such as sprinkling and drip irrigation has been suggested as a priority farming measure and is being expanded in the region currently these processes are applied to 1 million ha of maize and 0 3 million ha of wheat agricultural areas with a target of total 2 7 million ha in china by 2020 the promotion of implementation of fertigation policy moa 2016 in this study we hypothesized that drip fertigation would substantially decrease n2o emissions but increase no production because of higher oxidation of n2o to no during drip fertigation than during flood irrigation to test this hypothesis we monitored the n2o and no losses crop production and soil conditions in northern china under flood and drip irrigation with different n rates in the typical winter wheat summer maize cropping system of the region we aimed to analyze the effects of optimized fertilization and irrigation on crop production and n2o and no emissions the overall aim of this research is to develop appropriate practices to mitigate the production of greenhouse gases and improve resource use while maintaining high land

table 1 2 4 measurement of n2o and no fluxes from oct 20 2015 to oct 10 2016 n2o and no fluxes were measured in situ simultaneously using the closed chamber method yan et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 to facilitate air sampling a square stainless steel frame with a cross sectional area of 0 25 m2 was inserted into the soil to a depth of 20 cm in each experimental plot this frame was kept in place throughout the entire study period except when it was temporarily removed for necessary field operations such as tillage on each sampling day gases were collected from 8 00 am to 11 00 am local time in the morning within 7 14 d of fertilization rainfall tillage and irrigation events sampling was conducted twice per week during other periods before air sampling chambers bottom area of 0 25 m2 height ranging from 0 5 to 1 5 m depending on crop size were mounted onto base frames and sealed with rubber strips and clamps five air samples were collected for n2o detection and were taken from the

in flood irrigation four times treatments caused the mean soil temperature to be 13 9 c wheat season and 25 2 c maize season in the flood irrigation treatments fn600 and fn0 these values were significantly higher than those in the drip irrigation n600 n400 and n0 treatments by 9 4 and 5 in wheat and maize season respectively table 1 figs 1 and 2 soil moisture 0 10 cm layer expressed as wfps was mainly regulated by precipitation and irrigation events during the entire wheat season the wfps was similar in the flood and drip irrigation treatments 31 89 with a mean of 61 for fn600 and fn0 and 41 78 with a mean of 61 for n600 n420 and n0 during the entire maize season the wfps in the flood irrigation treatments was 37 93 mean 63 lower than that in the drip irrigation treatments 42 92 mean 68 fig 2a however during the 7 days after fertilization irrigation when peak n2o and no fluxes were monitored daily the average wfps in the flood irrigation treatments was 71 range 44 89 during the wheat season which was about 11 higher than that in the drip irrigation treatments mean 64 range 41 86 during the maize season the corresponding wfps in the flood irrigation treatments mean 77 range 68 89 was 13 higher than that in the drip irrigation treatments mean 68 range 48 84 3 2 temporal dynamics of soil inorganic n during the experimental period after each top dressing fertilization event high levels of soil no3 in drip irrigated soils lasted for about 3 days then sharply decreased however for flood irrigated soils soil no3 gradually decreased from 5 days after fertilization fig 2 throughout the wheat season the seasonal soil no3 n contents were similar among all the fertilization treatments n600 39 3 mg kg 1 n420 37 3 mg kg 1 fn600 42 5 mg kg 1 during the maize season the n600 and n420 treatments resulted in increasing levels of no3 from the seedling stage to the harvest period with average no3 n contents of 79 7 mg n kg 1 for n600 and 69 7 mg n kg 1 for n420 these values were significantly higher than that for fn600 37 4 mg n kg 1 which tended to decrease during the same period however if the 7 days after fertilization were considered the average soil no3 n contents during the wheat season were significantly lower in n600 51 2 5 2 mg kg 1 and n420 45 8 4 9 mg kg 1 than in fn600 102 9 11 1 mg kg 1 during maize season the soil no3 n contents in the 7 days after fertilization were significantly higher in n600 82 5 8 0 mg kg 1 and n420 79 3 8 9 mg kg 1 than in fn600 72 8 12 1 mg kg 1 finally the level of no3 n for the entire wheat and maize seasons was higher in n0 18 3 0 9 mg n kg 1 than in fn0 12 1 0 9 mg n kg 1 soil nh4 contents were much lower than no3 contents during the experimental period the nh4 n content peaked 11 times in the n600 and n420 treatments and decreased to 10 mg kg 1 at 2 days after each fertilization event while it peaked only four times in fn600 and decreased to 10 mg kg 1 at 4 days during the total wheat and maize seasons the levels of soil nh4 tended to be higher in the drip irrigation treatments than in the flood irrigation treatments but these differences were not significant however at 7 days after fertilization the nh4 n levels in soil were lower in n420 and n600 than in fn600 during the wheat season the average soil nh4 content during the 7 days after fertilization were 6 5 1 4 n420 9 7 1 9 n600 and 15 0 4 8 mg kg 1 fn600 in the maize season the corresponding soil nh4 n contents were 12 7 2 9 n420 14 9 3 6 n600 and 27 2 9 3 mg kg 1 fn600 3 3 crop yields for both crop seasons the highest grain yields were obtained in the drip fertigation treatments n600 and n420 although they were not significant differently from those in the fn600 treatment 6 8 t ha 1 for wheat and 8 7 t ha 1 for maize table 2 the n420 treatment i e optimized irrigation and fertigation produced the highest annual yield of 16 3 t ha 1 7 0 t ha 1 for wheat and 9 3 t ha 1 for maize with savings of 57 3 for water and 30 for fertilizer n additionally the grain yields of wheat and maize were 47 and 14 higher respectively in n0 than in fn0 3 4 n2o emissions the n600 and n420 treatments both had 11 n2o flux peaks because of fertilization events but fn600 had only four n2o flux peaks induced by fertilization and an additional two n2o flux peaks resulting from flood irrigation alone fig 3 for the fertigation treatments of n600 and n420 n2o flux peaks occurred within 3 days of fertigation during wheat season then decreased to 16 μg n m 2 h 1 within 5 days however during the maize season n2o flux peaks occurred within 2 days and remained at 50 200 μg m 2 h 1 for about 5 days in fn600 n2o flux peaks occurred within 3 days of basal and topdressing fertilization events and lasted for 8 days during the wheat season but lasted for 2 and 10 days respectively during the maize season during the experimental period the duration of n2o flux 16 μg n m 2 h 1 was 88 days in n600 81 days in n420 and 54 days in fn600 however overall the average n2o flux was significantly higher in fn600 62 11 μg n m 2 h 1 than in the drip fertigation treatments n600 54 7 and n420 39 4 μg n m 2 h 1 these findings indicated that when compared with the longer periods of low n2o flux peaks because of fertigation in n600 and n420 much higher but less frequent n2o flux peaks occurred in fn600 fig 3 the highest n2o fluxes for all treatments i e 618 3 560 3 and 276 8 μg n m 2 h 1 were in the maize season and occurred on august 9 2016 fn600 and july 22 2016 n600 and n420 respectively there was no significant difference in n2o fluxes between n0 and fn0 which were both 16 μg n m 2 h 1 the frequency and size of the n2o fluxes in all treatments were much lower in the wheat season than in the maize season the n2o emissions during the entire wheat season were 0 87 0 07 fn600 1 01 0 09 n600 and 0 79 0 05 kg n2o n ha 1 n420 which were much lower than those during the maize season 2 66 0 13 fn600 2 13 0 05 n600 and 1 46 0 07 kg n2o n ha 1 n420 respectively table 2 the maize season contributed approximately 63 2 63 4 75 1 67 8 and 64 9 of the annual cumulative n2o emissions in the fn0 n0 fn600 n600 and n420 treatments respectively compared with fn600 n600 did not show different cumulative n2o emissions during the wheat season but had significantly lower 19 9 n2o emissions during the maize season the n420 treatment significantly decreased the cumulative n2o emissions by 21 8 and 31 5 in the wheat and maize season respectively the direct emission factors i e efd of fn600 n600 and n420 were 0 19 0 25 and 0 24 respectively during the wheat season and 0 63 0 47 and 0 38 respectively during the maize season 3 5 no emissions similar to n2o the no emissions were related to fertilization irrigation and precipitation events but the peak no fluxes after fertilization lasted 1 or 2 days longer than the corresponding peak n2o fluxes in n420 and n600 figs 3 and 4 in the fertigation treatments of n600 and n420 no flux peaks occurred within 4 days of fertigation and decreased to 8 μg n m 2 h 1 within 7 days during the wheat season however they occurred within 2 days and lasted for 4 days during the maize season in fn600 no flux peaks occurred within 4 days of basal and topdressing fertilization and lasted for 13 days during the wheat season while they occurred in 3 days and lasted for 10 days during the maize season during the experimental period the duration of no fluxes 8 μg n m 2 h 1 was 85 days in n600 77 days in n420 and 50 days in fn600 the average no flux was significantly lower in n420 31 7 μg n m 2 h 1 than in n600 53 11 μg n m 2 h 1 and fn600 51 14 μg n m 2 h 1 but did not differ significantly between n0 7 8 0 7 μg n m 2 h 1 and fn0 6 9 0 7 μg n m 2 h 1 the highest no fluxes of 859 0 685 5 and 1171 5 μg n m 2 h 1 for n600 n420 and fn600 respectively occurred during the maize season the no emissions were 14 7 higher in n600 than in fn600 2 65 0 2 vs 2 31 0 28 kg no n ha 1 but this difference was not significant however optimal fertigation n420 significantly decreased no emissions by 35 1 fig 5 table 2 the maize season contributed 57 6 62 8 of annual no emissions similar to n2o the direct no emission factors efd of fn600 n600 and n420 were not significantly different between the wheat and maize seasons table 2 3 6 ratio of emitted no to n2o as shown in fig 6 the ratio of emitted no to n2o for fn600 n600 and n420 was 1 within 3 7 days of fertilization then declined to 1 in the winter wheat season however for the maize season the no n2o ratio after fertilization was 1 but increased as time advanced the average no n2o ratio was 1 1 n0 2 1 n420 2 9 n600 1 4 fn600 and 1 5 fn0 during wheat season and 0 4 n0 0 6 n420 0 8 n600 0 5 fn600 and 0 5 fn0 during maize season for the no fertilizer treatments i e n0 and fn0 a no n2or ratio 1 was much more frequent during the wheat season than during the maize season the temporal variations in the no n2o ratio were much lower in fn0 and n0 than in the fertilization treatments 3 7 effects of soil temperature moisture and mineral n contents on n2o and no emissions the n2o flux was often positively correlated with soil temperature p 0 05 during both seasons and with wfps p 0 01 during the wheat season these findings indicated that temperature and soil water content substantially affected n2o and no emissions table 3 additionally n2o and no tended to be positively correlated with soil no3 n content in the flood irrigation treatments and negatively correlated in the drip irrigation treatments particularly during the summer maize season however n2o and no were positively correlated with nh4 n content in the drip irrigation treatments p 0 01 3 8 water and nitrogen use efficiency the water use efficiency i e wue iwue and nitrogen use efficiency i e pfp anue were higher under drip irrigation than under flood irrigation during the wheat and maize seasons table 2 compared with their respective values in fn600 the values of wue iwue pfp and anue in n600 were increased by 81 4 p 0 05 202 p 0 05 3 6 and 4 9 in the wheat season and by 12 2 88 4 p 0 05 2 7 and 3 1 in the maize season compared with n600 the n420 treatment showed 1 6 lower wue and 1 3 lower iwue but 40 8 higher pfp p 0 05 and 45 0 higher anue p 0 05 in the wheat season and 4 2 4 0 48 7 p 0 05 and 43 4 p 0 05 higher wue iwue pfp and anue respectively in the maize season 4 discussion 4 1 n2o and no generation and diffusion in alkaline agricultural soils both n2o and no are produced through the microbial processes of nitrate dissimilation denitrification and nitrate ammonification and nitrification ammonia oxidation and nitrifier denitrification and through abiotic chemo denitrification reactions baggs 2008 kool et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 in previous studies the no emissions from agricultural fields were mainly ascribed to nitrification whereas the n2o emissions were ascribed to both nitrification and denitrification maljanen et al 2007 cui et al 2012 recent studies have confirmed that nitrification and nitrifier denitrification rather than denitrifier denitrification are the main processes of n2o and no generation in intensively n fertilized alkaline soils in northern china where the soil organic carbon content is low baggs 2008 ju et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 hence reduced n fertilization and nitrification inhibitors can effectively mitigate the n2o and no emissions from these agricultural soils cui et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 tian et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 moisture temperature and n substrates no3 and nh4 within agricultural soils are the main factors controlling the microbial processes of nitrification and nitrifier denitrification zhu et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 as reported in 3 1 throughout the cropping season particularly the maize season the soil temperatures were higher and the wfps was lower in flood irrigated soils than in drip irrigated soils however within 7 days of fertilization irrigation when peak n2o and no fluxes occurred the wfps of flood irrigated soils was significantly higher 11 higher in the wheat season and 13 higher in the maize season than that of drip irrigated soils the pulses of n2o and no simulated by additions of water were attributable to a phenomenon known as the pulsing effect which results from water activating microorganisms bacteria and fungi thereby stimulating nitrification and nitrifier denitrification sanchezmartin et al 2008 a high wfps 70 was shown to decrease soil o2 concentrations to a low level sustain high ammonia oxidation activity to produce more no2 by autotrophic nh3 oxidizers zhou et al 2017 and promote the reduction process no2 no n2o while inhibiting the oxidation processes of nh2oh and nitrate production no2 no3 barnard et al 2005 zhu et al 2013 soil temperature and wfps have both been found to be correlated with n2o and no fluxes li and liu 2010 wu et al 2018 we found that the cumulative n2o and no fluxes of fn600 were higher during the summer maize season for n2o than or not significantly different from those of n600 in other seasons table 2 at the tillering stage during the wheat season the high wfps 71 vs 71 in 7 days and mineral n content low n uptake caused by approx 6 soil temperature 47 vs 18 mg kg 1 in 7 days in n600 led to significantly greater n2o production 0 33 vs 0 11 kg n ha 1 via the nitrifier denitrification process compared with fn600 this may explain why there were no differences in n2o production between n600 and fn600 in the wheat season 1 01 vs 0 87 kg n ha 1 different from temperature and wfps soil no3 n contents were lower in the flood irrigation treatments than in the drip irrigation treatments we detected negative in drip irrigation and positive correlation in flood irrigation between n2o and no fluxes and no3 n contents and the positive correlation between n2o and no fluxes and nh4 n contents table 3 these results emphasized that in addition to nitrification oxidation nitrifier denitrification also substantially contributed to the generation and diffusion of n2o and no especially during the summer maize season these findings are consistent with those of other recent studies kool et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 this is because after the oxidation of nh4 to no2 more n was transformed to n2o and no instead of to no3 coinciding with the positive correlation between n2o and no fluxes and nh4 and the negative correlation between n2o and no fluxes and no3 table 3 during the process of oxidation of nh4 to no2 n2o and no are generated as by products of the reaction of nh4 to nh2oh noh while n2o is further oxidized to no however during nitrifier denitrification no2 is first reduced to no and then to n2o wrage et al 2001 huang et al 2014 tian et al 2016 a laboratory simulation found that the majority of nitrification occurred when the no n2o ratio was 1 anderson and levine 1986 meijide et al 2007 the no n2o was 1 after drip irrigation and then declined which was quite different from the situation after flood irrigation this implied that nitrification and nitrifier denitrification might be the main processes in drip irrigation and flood irrigation treatments respectively the higher no n2o ratio in the summer maize season than in the winter wheat season fig 6 reflected the lower reduction potential of no to n2o during the nitrifier denitrification process and wfps was significantly higher in summer than in winter the higher wfps in flood irrigation treatments than in drip irrigation treatments corresponded to the lower no n2o in flood irrigation treatments than in drip irrigation treatments this again highlighted that nitrifier denitrification played an important role in the transformation of n2o and no in these alkaline n fertilized soils 4 2 impacts of n fertilization and irrigation on n2o and no emissions compared with the fn600 treatment the n600 treatment significantly mitigated the cumulative n2o emissions in the maize season but did not affect n2o emissions during the wheat season these effects were achieved by lower water consumption in n600 57 of water saved the increased amount of irrigation fertilization events in n600 caused greater frequencies but lower peak levels of n2o and no fluxes compared with those in fn600 fig 3 during the winter wheat season in addition the cumulative n2o and no emissions of n600 were 17 higher also not statistically significant than those of fn600 however during the summer maize season n2o emissions were significantly lower by 20 and no emissions were significantly higher by 11 in n600 than in fn600 table 2 because temperature substantially controls the microbial process of n2o and no generation the higher temperature during the summer maize season than in the winter wheat season caused much higher n2o and no fluxes in the maize season than in the wheat season fig 2 consequently the higher temperature in fn600 than in n600 helped to generate more n2o and no particularly during the maize season tian et al 2016 wang et al 2016b wolff et al 2017 during the 7 days after fertilization irrigation when peak n2o and no fluxes occurred the wfps values of fn600 were 11 wheat season and 13 maize season higher than those of n600 while this might have explained the much higher n2o in fn600 during the maize season it also led to greater nitrifier denitrification in fn600 than in n600 which caused a greater reduction of no to n2o in fn600 than in n600 table 2 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 in addition to the water saving benefits of the n600 treatment n420 reduced the fertilizer n inputs by 30 and mitigated n2o emissions by 21 8 in the wheat season and by 31 5 in the maize season and no emissions by 29 8 in the wheat season and by 38 5 in the maize season in addition the crop yields of n420 were similar to those of n600 and fn600 these benefits were mostly a result of the lower no3 n 9 1 and nh4 n 18 9 in n420 than in n600 fig 2 because soil inorganic n was the direct substrate for n2o and no generation drip fertigation in the n600 n420 and n0 treatments provided an appropriate rate of water and or fertilizer n closer to crop roots compared with broadcast fertilization therefore drip fertigation is ideal for controlling the placement timing and rate of nutrients and water supplied to plants badr et al 2012 abalos et al 2014 koocheki et al 2014 at each time of drip fertigation the urea was directly applied to the crop rhizosphere with water this occurred at a high frequency but a low rate this practice greatly improved the fertilizer n and water use efficiency and land productivity and decreased the soil inorganic

intensively managed cropland northern china is one of the most important and intensively farmed regions in this semi arid area crop production is highly dependent on irrigation for water supply particularly during the winter wheat season 3 4 rounds of irrigation at 100 mm per application and at the sowing and fertilization stages during the summer maize season fang et al 2010 gao et al 2015 the water used for irrigation accounts for 80 of the total water use in the region deng et al 2006 this has resulted in the groundwater table declining at 1 5 m year 1 fang et al 2010 currell et al 2012 in this study the water use efficiency was 1 2 kg m 3 for fn600 1 0 and 1 5 kg m 3 for wheat and maize grain respectively table 2 which was similar to the corresponding average value of china of 1 1 kg m 3 deng et al 2006 fang et al 2010 but much lower than those of the united states 2 5 kg m 3 and the european union 2 3 kg m 3 howell 2001 xue et al 2015 in addition excessive water use in flood irrigation treatments might lead to vertical movement of no3 from the upper soil profile to deeper layers where it could be lost or accumulate currell et al 2012 sanchezmartin et al 2008 for drip fertigation the wue was as high as 1 77 kg m 3 n420 and 1 75 kg m 3 n600 corresponding to 65 7 and 45 5 reductions in irrigation water used during the wheat and maize season respectively compared with that of local farmers the pfp of n420 reached 37 kg kg 1 and 40 kg kg 1 corresponding to a 30 reduction in fertilizer n applied in the wheat and maize season respectively compared with n600 and fn600 the pfp of the optimal fertigation treatment was much higher than the national value of 25 37 kg kg 1 zhang et al 2017 currently fertigation technology is widely used in fruit production and greenhouse vegetable production but rarely in grain production even though this accounts for the largest proportion of farmland and the greatest consumption of water resources however the chinese government is currently advocating for the implementation of drip fertigation across the country because irrigation water is still free zhang et al 2017 farmers always overuse water to maintain high crop yields another obstacle to the expansion of drip fertigation technology is the high cost of infrastructure for fertilizer dissolution water transport and drip irrigation as well as the cost of maintaining the equipment cui et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 gao et al 2015 hence comprehensive regulation and policy reform in rural areas especially for water pricing are urgently required to promote the dissemination of drip fertigation technologies in china 5 conclusions drip fertigation and flood irrigation with synthetic n fertilizer in a winter wheat summer maize cropping system in northern china resulted in different n2o and no emissions drip fertigation at the same n level as fn600 significantly reduced n2o emissions by 19 9 during the maize season but did not significantly affect significant n2o emissions during the wheat season and increased the no emissions in the wheat and maize seasons by 20 9 and 11 0 respectively when compared with flood irrigation these differences were likely because of different n transformation processes i e higher nitrification in drip irrigation and higher nitrifier denitrification in flood irrigation treatments in summer these n transformation processes were significantly affected by variations in temperature moisture and soil inorganic n optimized fertigation reduced n and water input i e n420 is a promising farming practice for the region to maintain high crop yields this method can significantly mitigate n2o and no emissions while also greatly reducing the use of water and fertilizer because of higher water and nitrogen use efficiencies this method has great potential to promote sustainable agricultural development however its extension still requires the reform and implementation of water pricing and other relevant

11281,agricultural soil is a major source of n2o and no in this study we tested whether optimized n fertigation and water saving irrigation methods could improve nutrient and water use efficiency while maintaining productivity in the intensified farmed winter wheat triticum aestivum l summer maize zea mays l cropping system of northern china a field experiment was conducted to test different flood irrigation fn600 conventional n fertilization of 600 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and flood irrigation fn0 no n input and flood irrigation and drip fertigation n0 no n input and drip irrigation n420 optimized n fertilization of 420 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and drip irrigation n600 conventional n fertilization of 600 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and drip irrigation treatments compared with the fn600 treatment the n600 treatment reduced water use by 62 5 wheat season and 36 4 maize season the n600 treatment significantly reduced n2o emissions by 19 9 during the maize season but not during the wheat season the n600 treatment increased no emissions by 20 9 and 11 0 during the wheat and maize seasons respectively compared with the n600 treatment the n420 treatment significantly decreased n2o and no emissions by 21 8 and 29 8 respectively during the wheat season and by 31 5 and 41 6 respectively during the maize season while achieving higher crop yield the direct emission factors ratio of the cumulative n2o or no emissions of fertilized treatment minus ck to n rate of n2o and no were 0 19 0 25 and 0 21 0 27 for the wheat season and 0 38 0 63 and 0 34 0 42 for the maize season respectively optimal fertilization n420 significantly increased the water use efficiency intrinsic water use efficiency partial factor productivity and apparent nitrogen use efficiency in both the wheat and the maize seasons in addition to nitrification nitrifier denitrification contributed to the generation and diffusion of n2o and no especially during the summer maize season considering the higher productivity more efficient use of irrigation water and nitrogen and lower n2o and no emissions drip irrigation combined with optimized n fertilization is recommended in northern china keywords n2o no optimized fertilization drip irrigation nitrifier denitrification water pricing 1 introduction globally agricultural soils contribute approximately 67 and 18 of total anthropogenic n2o and no emissions respectively reay et al 2012 gaihre et al 2015 total fertilized cropland annually emits 1 7 4 8 tg of n2o n and 1 6 8 9 tg of no n ipcc 2007 cui et al 2012 yao et al 2017 accordingly it is important to mitigate n2o and no emissions through optimized farming practices in agricultural sectors drip irrigation combined with dissolved n fertilizer fertigation which provides an appropriate amount of n and water to crop roots in a more precise and timely manner than does broadcast fertilization has been confirmed to be an efficient method of irrigation and fertilization abalos et al 2014 farneselli et al 2015 many studies have shown that drip fertigation can decrease n losses badr et al 2012 koocheki et al 2014 and reduce transformable n to n2o and or no maris et al 2015 wang et al 2016a reported a significant reduction 14 6 of n2o in the winter wheat season under drip irrigation compared with flood irrigation however tian et al 2016 found that drip fertigation reduced n2o emissions by 7 7 but increased no emissions by 21 7 during the summer maize season these findings indicated that edaphic properties climate conditions and farming practices may exert different effects on soil n2o and no emissions barnard et al 2005 deppe et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 northern china one of the most intensified agricultural regions in china produced 67 and 28 of the nation s wheat triticum aestivum l and maize zea mays l respectively in 2014 nbsc 2015 various sound farming practices have been implemented to reduce fertilizer n and water inputs and maintain the high crop yield in this region since the 1990s zhang et al 2011 the fertilizer n efficiency in the region has been reported to be 30 for maize and wheat miao et al 2011 the reported proportions of n losses from applied fertilizers via nitrification and denitrification range from 0 9 to 10 9 zhang et al 2008 ju et al 2009 such gaseous n losses including nh3 exert potential pressure on the aquatic environment chien et al 2009 and air quality xu et al 2016 and contribute to regional and global greenhouse gas emissions zhang et al 2017 in northern china agriculture is dependent on pumping deep groundwater for irrigation and irrigation water accounts for 80 of total water use in the region deng et al 2006 as a result the groundwater level is declining rapidly at a rate of 0 8 m yr 1 in this region fang et al 2010 heavy irrigation has also increased no3 leaching from cropland deng et al 2006 resulting in the entry of no3 to deeper profiles after which it infiltrates groundwater or is permanently lost from the system currell et al 2012 optimizing fertilization and irrigation by methods such as sprinkling and drip irrigation has been suggested as a priority farming measure and is being expanded in the region currently these processes are applied to 1 million ha of maize and 0 3 million ha of wheat agricultural areas with a target of total 2 7 million ha in china by 2020 the promotion of implementation of fertigation policy moa 2016 in this study we hypothesized that drip fertigation would substantially decrease n2o emissions but increase no production because of higher oxidation of n2o to no during drip fertigation than during flood irrigation to test this hypothesis we monitored the n2o and no losses crop production and soil conditions in northern china under flood and drip irrigation with different n rates in the typical winter wheat summer maize cropping system of the region we aimed to analyze the effects of optimized fertilization and irrigation on crop production and n2o and no emissions the overall aim of this research is to develop appropriate practices to mitigate the production of greenhouse gases and improve resource use while maintaining high land

data are presented as mean standard error 3 results 3 1 climate and soil conditions during the study period the higher frequencies of fertilization irrigation events in drip irrigation 11 times than in flood irrigation four times treatments caused the mean soil temperature to be 13 9 c wheat season and 25 2 c maize season in the flood irrigation treatments fn600 and fn0 these values were significantly higher than those in the drip irrigation n600 n400 and n0 treatments by 9 4 and 5 in wheat and maize season respectively table 1 figs 1 and 2 soil moisture 0 10 cm layer expressed as wfps was mainly regulated by precipitation and irrigation events during the entire wheat season the wfps was similar in the flood and drip irrigation treatments 31 89 with a mean of 61 for fn600 and fn0 and 41 78 with a mean of 61 for n600 n420 and n0 during the entire maize season the wfps in the flood irrigation treatments was 37 93 mean 63 lower than that in the drip irrigation treatments 42 92 mean 68 fig 2a however during the 7 days after fertilization irrigation when peak n2o and no fluxes were monitored daily the average wfps in the flood irrigation treatments was 71 range 44 89 during the wheat season which was about 11 higher than that in the drip irrigation treatments mean 64 range 41 86 during the maize season the corresponding wfps in the flood irrigation treatments mean

fertilization event high levels of soil no3 in drip irrigated soils lasted for about 3 days then sharply decreased however for flood irrigated soils soil no3 gradually decreased from 5 days after fertilization fig 2 throughout the wheat season the seasonal soil no3 n contents were similar among all the fertilization treatments n600 39 3 mg kg 1 n420 37 3 mg kg 1 fn600 42 5 mg kg 1 during the maize season the n600 and n420 treatments resulted in increasing levels of no3 from the seedling stage to the harvest period with average no3 n contents of 79 7 mg n kg 1 for n600 and 69 7 mg n kg 1 for n420 these values were significantly higher than that for fn600 37 4 mg n kg 1 which tended to decrease during the same period however if the 7 days after fertilization were considered the average soil no3 n contents during the wheat season were significantly lower in n600 51 2 5 2 mg kg 1 and n420 45 8 4 9 mg kg 1 than in fn600 102 9 11 1 mg kg 1 during maize season the soil no3 n contents in the 7 days after fertilization were significantly higher in n600 82 5 8 0 mg kg 1 and n420 79 3 8 9 mg kg 1 than in fn600 72 8 12 1 mg kg 1 finally the level of no3 n for the entire wheat and maize seasons was higher in n0 18 3 0 9 mg n kg 1 than in fn0 12 1 0 9 mg n kg 1 soil nh4 contents were much lower than no3 contents during the experimental period the nh4 n content peaked 11 times in the n600 and n420 treatments and decreased to 10 mg kg 1 at 2 days after each fertilization event while it peaked only four times in fn600 and decreased to 10 mg kg 1 at 4 days during the total wheat and maize seasons the levels of soil nh4 tended to be higher in the drip irrigation treatments than in the flood irrigation treatments but these differences were not significant however at 7 days after fertilization the nh4 n levels in soil were lower in n420 and n600 than in fn600 during the wheat season the average soil nh4 content during the 7 days after fertilization were 6 5 1 4 n420 9 7 1 9 n600 and 15 0 4 8 mg kg 1 fn600 in the maize season the corresponding soil nh4 n contents were 12 7 2 9 n420 14 9 3 6 n600 and 27 2 9 3 mg kg 1 fn600 3 3 crop yields for both crop seasons the highest grain yields were obtained in the drip fertigation treatments n600 and n420 although they were not significant differently from those in the fn600 treatment 6 8 t ha 1 for wheat and 8 7 t ha 1 for maize table 2 the n420 treatment i e optimized irrigation and fertigation produced the highest annual yield of 16 3 t ha 1 7 0 t ha 1 for wheat and 9 3 t ha 1 for maize with savings of 57 3 for water and 30 for fertilizer n additionally the grain yields of wheat and maize were 47 and 14 higher respectively in n0 than in fn0 3 4 n2o emissions the n600 and n420 treatments both had 11 n2o flux peaks because of fertilization events but fn600 had only four n2o flux peaks induced by fertilization and an additional two n2o flux peaks resulting from flood irrigation alone fig 3 for the fertigation treatments of n600 and n420 n2o flux peaks occurred within 3 days of fertigation during wheat season then decreased to 16 μg n m 2 h 1 within 5 days however during the maize season n2o flux peaks occurred within 2 days and remained at 50 200 μg m 2 h 1 for about 5 days in fn600 n2o flux peaks occurred within 3 days of basal and topdressing fertilization events and lasted for 8 days during the wheat season but lasted for 2 and 10 days respectively during the maize season during the experimental period the duration of n2o flux 16 μg n m 2 h 1 was 88 days in n600 81 days in n420 and 54 days in fn600 however overall the average n2o flux was significantly higher in fn600 62 11 μg n m 2 h 1 than in the drip fertigation treatments n600 54 7 and n420 39 4 μg n m 2 h 1 these findings indicated that when compared with the longer periods of low n2o flux peaks because of fertigation in n600 and n420 much higher but less frequent n2o flux peaks occurred in fn600 fig 3 the highest n2o fluxes for all treatments i e 618 3 560 3 and 276 8 μg n m 2 h 1 were in the maize season and occurred on august 9 2016 fn600 and july 22 2016 n600 and n420 respectively there was no significant difference in n2o fluxes between n0 and fn0 which were both 16 μg n m 2 h 1 the frequency and size of the n2o fluxes in all treatments were much lower in the wheat season than in the maize season the n2o emissions during the entire wheat season were 0 87 0 07 fn600 1 01 0 09 n600 and 0 79 0 05 kg n2o n ha 1 n420 which were much lower than those during the maize season 2 66 0 13 fn600 2 13 0 05 n600 and 1 46 0 07 kg n2o n ha 1 n420 respectively table 2 the maize season contributed approximately 63 2 63 4 75 1 67 8 and 64 9 of the annual cumulative n2o emissions in the fn0 n0 fn600 n600 and n420 treatments respectively compared with fn600 n600 did not show different cumulative n2o emissions during the wheat season but had significantly lower 19 9 n2o emissions during the maize season the n420 treatment significantly decreased the cumulative n2o emissions by 21 8 and 31 5 in the wheat and maize season respectively the direct emission factors i e efd of fn600 n600 and n420 were 0 19 0 25 and 0 24 respectively during the wheat season and 0 63 0 47 and 0 38 respectively during the maize season 3 5 no emissions similar to n2o the no emissions were related to fertilization irrigation and precipitation events but the peak no fluxes after fertilization lasted 1 or 2 days longer than the corresponding peak n2o fluxes in n420 and n600 figs 3 and 4 in the fertigation treatments of n600 and n420 no flux peaks occurred within 4 days of fertigation and decreased to 8 μg n m 2 h 1 within 7 days during the wheat season however they occurred within 2 days and lasted for 4 days during the maize season in fn600 no flux peaks occurred within 4 days of basal and topdressing fertilization and lasted for 13 days during the wheat season while they occurred in 3 days and lasted for 10 days during the maize season during the experimental period the duration of no fluxes 8 μg n m 2 h 1 was 85 days in n600 77 days in n420 and 50 days in fn600 the average no flux was significantly lower in n420 31 7 μg n m 2 h 1 than in n600 53 11 μg n m 2 h 1 and fn600 51 14 μg n m 2 h 1 but did not differ significantly between n0 7 8 0 7 μg n m 2 h 1 and fn0 6 9 0 7 μg n m 2 h 1 the highest no fluxes of 859 0 685 5 and 1171 5 μg n m 2 h 1 for n600 n420 and fn600 respectively occurred during the maize season the no emissions were 14 7 higher in n600 than in fn600 2 65 0 2 vs 2 31 0 28 kg no n ha 1 but this difference was not significant however optimal fertigation n420 significantly decreased no emissions by 35 1 fig 5 table 2 the maize season contributed 57 6 62 8 of annual no emissions similar to n2o the direct no emission factors efd of fn600 n600 and n420 were not significantly different between the wheat and maize seasons table 2 3 6 ratio of emitted no to n2o as shown in fig 6 the ratio of emitted no to n2o for fn600 n600 and n420 was 1 within 3 7 days of fertilization then declined to 1 in the winter wheat season however for the maize season the no n2o ratio after fertilization was 1 but increased as time advanced the average no n2o ratio was 1 1 n0 2 1 n420 2 9 n600 1 4 fn600 and 1 5 fn0 during wheat season and 0 4 n0 0 6 n420 0 8 n600 0 5 fn600 and 0 5 fn0 during maize season for the no fertilizer treatments i e n0 and fn0 a no n2or ratio 1 was much more frequent during the wheat season than during the maize season the temporal variations in the no n2o ratio were much lower in fn0 and n0 than in the fertilization treatments 3 7 effects of soil temperature moisture and mineral n contents on n2o and no emissions the n2o flux was often positively correlated with soil temperature p 0 05 during both seasons and with wfps p 0 01 during the wheat season these findings indicated that temperature and soil water content substantially affected n2o and no emissions table 3 additionally n2o and no tended to be positively correlated with soil no3 n content in the flood irrigation treatments and negatively correlated in the drip irrigation treatments particularly during the summer maize season however n2o and no were positively correlated with nh4 n content in the drip irrigation treatments p 0 01 3 8 water and nitrogen use efficiency the water use efficiency i e wue iwue and nitrogen use efficiency i e pfp anue were higher under drip irrigation than under flood irrigation during the wheat and maize seasons table 2 compared with their respective values in fn600 the values of wue iwue pfp and anue in n600 were increased by 81 4 p 0 05 202 p 0 05 3 6 and 4 9 in the wheat season and by 12 2 88 4 p 0 05 2 7 and 3 1 in the maize season compared with n600 the n420 treatment showed 1 6 lower wue and 1 3 lower iwue but 40 8 higher pfp p 0 05 and 45 0 higher anue p 0 05 in the wheat season and 4 2 4 0 48 7 p 0 05 and 43 4 p 0 05 higher wue iwue pfp and anue respectively in the maize season 4 discussion 4 1 n2o and no generation and diffusion in alkaline agricultural soils both n2o and no are produced through the microbial processes of nitrate dissimilation denitrification and nitrate ammonification and nitrification ammonia oxidation and nitrifier denitrification and through abiotic chemo denitrification reactions baggs 2008 kool et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 in previous studies the no emissions from agricultural fields were mainly ascribed to nitrification whereas the n2o emissions were ascribed to both nitrification and denitrification maljanen et al 2007 cui et al 2012 recent studies have confirmed that nitrification and nitrifier denitrification rather than denitrifier denitrification are the main processes of n2o and no generation in intensively n fertilized alkaline soils in northern china where the soil organic carbon content is low baggs 2008 ju et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 hence reduced n fertilization and nitrification inhibitors can effectively mitigate the n2o and no emissions from these agricultural soils cui et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 tian et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 moisture temperature and n substrates no3 and nh4 within agricultural soils are the main factors controlling the microbial processes of nitrification and nitrifier denitrification zhu et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 as reported in 3 1 throughout the cropping season particularly the maize season the soil temperatures were higher and the wfps was lower in flood irrigated soils than in drip irrigated soils however within 7 days of fertilization irrigation when peak n2o and no fluxes occurred the wfps of flood irrigated soils was significantly higher 11 higher in the wheat season and 13 higher in the maize season than that of drip irrigated soils the pulses of n2o and no simulated by additions of water were attributable to a phenomenon known as the pulsing effect which results from water activating microorganisms bacteria and fungi thereby stimulating nitrification and nitrifier denitrification sanchezmartin et al 2008 a high wfps 70 was shown to decrease soil o2 concentrations to a low level sustain high ammonia oxidation activity to produce more no2 by autotrophic nh3 oxidizers zhou et al 2017 and promote the reduction process no2 no n2o while inhibiting the oxidation processes of nh2oh and nitrate production no2 no3 barnard et al 2005 zhu et al 2013 soil temperature and wfps have both been found to be correlated with n2o and no fluxes li and liu 2010 wu et al 2018 we found that the cumulative n2o and no fluxes of fn600 were higher during the summer maize season for n2o than or not significantly different from those of n600 in other seasons table 2 at the tillering stage during the wheat season the high wfps 71 vs 71 in 7 days and mineral n content low n uptake caused by approx 6 soil temperature 47 vs 18 mg kg 1 in 7 days in n600 led to significantly greater n2o production 0 33 vs 0 11 kg n ha 1 via the nitrifier denitrification process compared with fn600 this may explain why there were no differences in n2o production between n600 and fn600 in the wheat season 1 01 vs 0 87 kg n ha 1 different from temperature and wfps soil no3 n contents were lower in the flood irrigation treatments than in the drip irrigation treatments we detected negative in drip irrigation and positive correlation in flood irrigation between n2o and no fluxes and no3 n contents and the positive correlation between n2o and no fluxes and nh4 n contents table 3 these results emphasized that in addition to nitrification oxidation nitrifier denitrification also substantially contributed to the generation and diffusion of n2o and no especially during the summer maize season these findings are consistent with those of other recent studies kool et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 this is because after the oxidation of nh4 to no2 more n was transformed to n2o and no instead of to no3 coinciding with the positive correlation between n2o and no fluxes and nh4 and the negative correlation between n2o and no fluxes and no3 table 3 during the process of oxidation of nh4 to no2 n2o and no are generated as by products of the reaction of nh4 to nh2oh noh while n2o is further oxidized to no however during nitrifier denitrification no2 is first reduced to no and then to n2o wrage et al 2001 huang et al 2014 tian et al 2016 a laboratory simulation found that the majority of nitrification occurred when the no n2o ratio was 1 anderson and levine 1986 meijide et al 2007 the no n2o was 1 after drip irrigation and then declined which was quite different from the situation after flood irrigation this implied that nitrification and nitrifier denitrification might be the main processes in drip irrigation and flood irrigation treatments respectively the higher no n2o ratio in the summer maize season than in the winter wheat season fig 6 reflected the lower reduction potential of no to n2o during the nitrifier denitrification process and wfps was significantly higher in summer than in winter the higher wfps in flood irrigation treatments than in drip irrigation treatments corresponded to the lower no n2o in flood irrigation treatments than in drip irrigation treatments this again highlighted that nitrifier denitrification played an important role in the transformation of n2o and no in these alkaline n fertilized soils 4 2 impacts of n fertilization and irrigation on n2o and no emissions compared with the fn600 treatment the n600 treatment significantly mitigated the cumulative n2o emissions in the maize season but did not affect n2o emissions during the wheat season these effects were achieved by lower water consumption in n600 57 of water saved the increased amount of irrigation fertilization events in n600 caused greater frequencies but lower peak levels of n2o and no fluxes compared with those in fn600 fig 3 during the winter wheat season in addition the cumulative n2o and no emissions of n600 were 17 higher also not statistically significant than those of fn600 however during the summer maize season n2o emissions were significantly lower by 20 and no emissions were significantly higher by 11 in n600 than in fn600 table 2 because temperature substantially controls the microbial process of n2o and no generation the higher temperature during the summer maize season than in the winter wheat season caused much higher n2o and no fluxes in the maize season than in the wheat season fig 2 consequently the higher temperature in fn600 than in n600 helped to generate more n2o and no particularly during the maize season tian et al 2016 wang et al 2016b wolff et al 2017 during the 7 days after fertilization irrigation when peak n2o and no fluxes occurred the wfps values of fn600 were 11 wheat season and 13 maize season higher than those of n600 while this might have explained the much higher n2o in fn600 during the maize season it also led to greater nitrifier denitrification in fn600 than in n600 which caused a greater reduction of no to n2o in fn600 than in n600 table 2 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 in addition to the water saving benefits of the n600 treatment n420 reduced the fertilizer n inputs by 30 and mitigated n2o emissions by 21 8 in the wheat season and by 31 5 in the maize season and no emissions by 29 8 in the wheat season and by 38 5 in the maize season in addition the crop yields of n420 were similar to those of n600 and fn600 these benefits were mostly a result of the lower no3 n 9 1 and nh4 n 18 9 in n420 than in n600 fig 2 because soil inorganic n was the direct substrate for n2o and no generation drip fertigation in the n600 n420 and n0 treatments provided an appropriate rate of water and or fertilizer n closer to crop roots compared with broadcast fertilization therefore drip fertigation is ideal for controlling the placement timing and rate of nutrients and water supplied to plants badr et al 2012 abalos et al 2014 koocheki et al 2014 at each time of drip fertigation the urea was directly applied to the crop rhizosphere with water this occurred at a high frequency but a low rate this practice greatly improved the fertilizer n and water use efficiency and land productivity and decreased the soil inorganic n pool fig 2 thus this method reduced the n leaching risk tian et al 2016 and n2o emissions badr et al 2012 abalos et al 2014 koocheki et al 2014 4 3 dissemination of drip fertigation technologies in intensively managed cropland northern china is one of the most important and intensively farmed regions in this semi arid area crop production is highly dependent on irrigation for water supply particularly during the winter wheat season 3 4 rounds of irrigation at 100 mm per application and at the sowing and fertilization stages during the summer maize season fang et al 2010 gao et al 2015 the water used for irrigation accounts for 80 of the total water use in the region deng et al 2006 this has resulted in the groundwater table declining at 1 5 m year 1 fang et al 2010 currell et al 2012 in this study the water use efficiency was 1 2 kg m 3 for fn600 1 0 and 1 5 kg m 3 for wheat and maize grain respectively table 2 which was similar to the corresponding average value of china of 1 1 kg m 3 deng et al 2006 fang et al 2010 but much lower than those of the united states 2 5 kg m 3 and the european union 2 3 kg m 3 howell 2001 xue et al 2015 in addition excessive water use in flood irrigation treatments might lead to vertical movement of no3 from the upper soil profile to deeper layers where it could be lost or accumulate currell et al 2012 sanchezmartin et al 2008 for drip fertigation the wue was as high as 1 77 kg m 3 n420 and 1 75 kg m 3 n600 corresponding to 65 7 and 45 5 reductions in irrigation water used during the wheat and maize season respectively compared with that of local farmers the pfp of n420 reached 37 kg kg 1 and 40 kg kg 1 corresponding to a 30 reduction in fertilizer n applied in the wheat and maize season respectively compared with n600 and fn600 the pfp of the optimal fertigation treatment was much higher than the national value of 25 37 kg kg 1 zhang et al 2017 currently fertigation technology is widely used in fruit production and greenhouse vegetable production but rarely in grain production even though this accounts for the largest proportion of farmland and the greatest consumption of water resources however the chinese government is currently advocating for the implementation of drip fertigation across the country because irrigation water is still free zhang et al 2017 farmers always overuse water to maintain high crop yields another obstacle to the expansion of drip fertigation technology is the high cost of infrastructure for fertilizer dissolution water transport and drip irrigation as well as the cost of maintaining the equipment cui et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 gao et al 2015 hence comprehensive regulation and policy reform in rural areas especially for water pricing are urgently required to promote the dissemination of drip fertigation technologies in china 5 conclusions drip fertigation and flood irrigation with synthetic n fertilizer in a winter wheat summer maize cropping system in northern china resulted in different n2o and no emissions drip fertigation at the same n level as fn600 significantly reduced n2o emissions by 19 9 during the maize season but did not significantly affect significant n2o emissions during the wheat season and increased the no emissions in the wheat and maize seasons by 20 9 and 11 0 respectively when compared with flood irrigation these differences were likely because of different n transformation processes i e higher nitrification in drip irrigation and higher nitrifier denitrification in flood irrigation treatments in summer these n transformation processes were significantly affected by variations in temperature moisture and soil inorganic n optimized fertigation reduced n and water input i e n420 is a promising farming practice for the region to maintain high crop yields this method can significantly mitigate n2o and no emissions while also greatly reducing the use of water and fertilizer because of higher water and nitrogen use efficiencies this method has great potential to promote sustainable agricultural development however its extension still requires the reform and implementation of water pricing and other relevant

11282,water deficit severely compromises the homeostatic balance of plants and suggests a redox imbalance in cells melatonin is described as a promoter of stress tolerance in plants that induces the expression of stress related genes reduces lipid peroxidation and increases the antioxidant system to analyze the influence of exogenous melatonin on the promotion of tolerance to water deficit we applied concentrations of 300 μm and 500 μm to coffea arabica l seedlings here we show that the intensity of the short term responses to melatonin may vary according to the concentration of melatonin we also report that lower concentrations of melatonin 300 μm promote an increase in the root system and the protection of the photosynthetic apparatus allowing greater gas exchange greater carboxylation efficiency and higher chlorophyll contents moreover melatonin improved the activity of the enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant systems and reduced lipid peroxidation in addition we demonstrated that higher concentrations 500 μm caused negative effects on stress tolerance thus demonstrating a toxic level overall these results demonstrated that melatonin mediates the signaling for water deficit responses by acting as an inductor of tolerance most likely enhanced by increased carboxylation efficiency and antioxidant systems this study provides evidence that exogenous melatonin protects coffee against water deficit keywords antioxidant water deficit gas exchange carbohydrate metabolism coffee 1 introduction coffee has great importance for the world and stands out as the second most traded commodity worldwide coffee belongs to the genus coffea and has two large species of world importance coffea arabica and coffea canefora known as arabica coffee and conilon respectively conab 2015 however the coffee plantations of brazil are comprised primarily of cultivars of coffea arabica this species offers products of good quality and great acceptance by the consumer market nogueira 2005 arabica coffee beans produce finer and more refined beverages as well as having an intense aroma and the most varied types of tastes body and acidity semmelroch and grosch 1996 genetic and breeding researchers have developed several coffee cultivars and lines from the arabica variety including the cultivar catuaí nogueira 2005 the catuaí coffee cultivar shows great adaptability as well as high productivity in most of the coffee regions in brazil and around the world this cultivar exhibits short height allowing a higher density of planting and facilitating crop and phytosanitary treatments in addition the catuaí cultivar offers important characteristics such as producing abundantly during the first years of harvest being less affected by deficiencies of calcium magnesium and zinc and being more resistant to coffee rust blank et al 1991 such characteristics arouse great interest in this coffee cultivar among coffee producers around the world for maintaining this productivity growers tend to expand its cultivation to increasing areas resulting in exposure to edaphoclimatic adversities water scarcity is one of the most severe adversities water scarcity is a limiting environmental factor and severely compromises the homeostatic balance of the plants in general responses to water deficit begin with the increased endogenous production of abscisic acid aba which induces the increased expression of several water stress response genes and activates a signaling cascade that leads to reduced stomatal conductance gs and consequently internal carbon dioxide concentration ci osakabe et al 2014 in addition there is a reduction in the carboxylation activity of the ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco enzyme due to the low levels of its substrate co2 xu et al 2013 to function with this reduction in the carboxylation activity of rubisco naph accumulates and nadp is unavailable to receive the electrons from the end of the photochemical stage resulting in electron accumulation porcar castell et al 2014 these electrons are then donated to molecular oxygen generating superoxide radicals which together with other reactive species can damage the photosynthetic apparatus as well as the peroxidation of lipid membranes and chlorophylls nishiyama et al 2011 due to this low photosynthetic assimilation there is a reduction in the synthesis of sucrose and deprivation of the supply of soluble sugars to maintain metabolism hammond and white 2008 additionally this disaccharide can be hydrolyzed to form hexoses and allocated in reserve organs for later uses xu et al 2015 this allocation of assimilates from the aerial part to the roots can increase root growth by increasing water uptake by roots to control these imbalances caused by low photosynthetic assimilation and other physiological processes that lead to the formation of ros plants have a cellular antioxidant defense system consisting of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase sod ascorbate peroxidase apx and catalase cat and nonenzymatic components such as ascorbate and glutathione which together act to neutralize the reactive oxygen species ros protecting the cells from possible oxidative damage sharma et al 2012 in addition to these antioxidant defense mechanisms the plant s tolerance to water deficit involves the accumulation of organic solutes such as proline that function to maintain its osmotic adjustment in this sense proline increases the resistance to dehydration helping to reduce the water potential since it allows the movement of water to the interior of the cells minimizing the damage caused by excess ions burritt 2012 proline forms a layer of hydration around proteins preventing them from being damaged by the stress conditions burritt 2012 in this manner the drought increases the accumulation of osmolytes for water retention or to avoid excessive loss of water melatonin n acetyl 5 methoxytryptamine is described as a stress tolerance promoter in plants arnao and hernández ruiz 2014 jiang et al 2016 shi et al 2015 since its synthesis is induced in plants exposed to biotic and abiotic stresses melatonin acts to limit oxidative stress by inducing the expression of stress related genes increasing the enzymatic antioxidant system and reducing lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 levels reiter et al 2015 melatonin positively regulates the mrna expression of several biotic and abiotic stress response genes such as the c repeat binding factors cbfs drought response element binding factors dreb1 s in arabidopsis thaliana shi et al 2015 increases the activity of antioxidant enzymes wang et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 and reduces the levels of malondialdehyde mda jiang et al 2016 and h2o2 wang et al 2013 in addition melatonin induces increased levels of ascorbate since this molecule is a secondary antioxidant that signals retrograde to the nucleus under low photosynthetic status moreover plants treated with melatonin showed higher growth rates than those not treated wang et al 2016 probably enhanced by the increased sugar metabolism and photosynthetic rates zhao et al 2015 although the benefits of melatonin in mitigating the damage caused by abiotic stresses are known there is no data in the literature regarding the induction of the tolerance to water deficit in coffee in light of the responses triggered by melatonin in plants exposed to low water status concentrations of 300 μm and 500 μm melatonin were applied to coffee seedlings to analyze the influence of exogenous melatonin on the promotion of the tolerance to water deficit therefore we show that the intensity of the short term responses to melatonin may vary according to the concentration of melatonin overall these results demonstrated that melatonin mediates the signaling for drought stress responses by acting as an inductor of tolerance most likely enhanced by increased carboxylation efficiency antioxidant system and root systems this study provides evidence of water deficit protection in coffee by exogenous melatonin 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design seedlings of coffea arabica l cv catuaí 144 were transferred to polypropylene pots containing 3 kg of standard substrate for coffee seedlings consisting of sifted subsoil sand and tanned corral manure and sieved in ratios of 2 1 1 plus fertilizer containing nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in the proportions 4 14 8 after transplantation the plants were acclimated for four weeks and then were subjected to the following treatments control ct in which the plants were irrigated and the substrate moisture was maintained close to the field capacity water deficit wd in which the plants were kept at 40 of the maximum moisture retention capacity melatonin at 300 μm water deficit m300 where melatonin was applied to the soil and the plants were maintained at 40 moisture retention capacity and melatonin at 500 μm water deficit m500 in which melatonin was applied to the soil and the plants were maintained at 40 of the maximum moisture retention capacity the determination of the ct condition in which the soil was maintained close to the maximum moisture retention capacity was performed using the direct method a soil sample was oven dried weighed and placed in a container with water and the surface of the container was covered by a plastic bag to avoid evaporation until it reached saturation by capillarity the maximum water retention capacity was determined by the difference between the dry and the saturated weight the melatonin stock solution was prepared by dissolving melatonin in ethanol 50 mg of melatonin in 1 ml of ethanol after the stock solution was prepared it was diluted to obtain the appropriate concentrations that were used for the application and the volume was brought to 100 ml with distilled water in each pot 100 ml of melatonin solution was applied directly to the soil in a single application before the treatments all the pots were weighed to maintain the humidity at 100 following this procedure melatonin was applied at concentrations of 300 and 500 μm and the weight of the pots was monitored daily to maintain them at 40 of field capacity in the water deficit treatment plants not treated with melatonin 100 ml of distilled water were applied so that they had the same soil moisture as those treated with melatonin the evaluation and data collection were performed in two periods the first evaluation was performed twenty days after the treatments when the first

increases leaf water potential and promotes growth in coffee plants under water deficit to understand the role of melatonin in water deficit tolerance in coffee seedlings we subjected 6 month old coffee seedlings to water restriction conditions with or without the application of melatonin to the soil the leaves of three plants were collected before the treatments were applied to verify that they did not differ in their water potential a leaf of each plant was collected two hours before dawn when the leaf water potential was maximal kramer and boyer 1995 and the samples did not differ in either water potential or dry matter groups of plants were subjected to water deficit 40 maximum soil moisture retention capacity water deficit with the application of 300 μm melatonin m300 and water deficit with the application of 500 μm melatonin m500 the control group ct was maintained in optimal water conditions that correspond to soil that contains 100 of its moisture retention capacity after 20 days of treatment it was verified that the plants that were under water restriction showed lower values of water potential fig 1 than those kept in a normal water condition ct independently of the treatment it was also observed that the plants of m300 treatment showed values of water potential higher than those verified in wd plants whereas the plants of m500 treatment exhibited water potential values similar to those observed in wd plants this suggests that the effect of melatonin on water potential depends on the dose applied after this period when the plants were rehydrated it was verified that the water potential of the plants subjected to water deficit had increased reaching the same values of the water potential of the ct plants after 21 days of treatment ct plants and m300 plants had higher values of dry shoot matter than wd plants or m500 plants table 1 treatment with melatonin also influenced root growth table 1 we observed that the plants subjected to the water deficit had higher values of root dry matter than ct plants m300 plants had higher values of root dry matter than any of the other treatments nevertheless in plants subjected to water deficit not treated or treated with melatonin the root shoot dry matter ratio table 1 was higher than that in ct plants thus the data suggest that under conditions of water restriction plants invest in root growth as a morphological strategy to increase the efficiency of water absorption we also observed that there was a reduction in leaf area in response to the water deficit however m300 plants showed higher values of total leaf area table 1 when compared to wd or m500 plants thus we suggest that the dose of 300 μm melatonin guarantees the homeostatic balance of the vegetative tissue during conditions of water deficit which contributes to its growth in this condition 3 2 melatonin increases chlorophyll content and improves gas exchange in coffee seedlings under water deficit the results showed that after 20 days of treatments ct plants and m300 plants had higher chlorophyll values fig 2 than wd plants and m500 plants after 24 h of rehydration we observed that the plants that were under water restriction showed a rapid increase in chlorophyll content regardless of the treatment and the highest values were observed in m300 plants followed by m500 plants these results demonstrate that melatonin is possibly related to the maintenance of the photosynthetic pigments or the expression of genes involved in the biosynthetic route since the plants that received melatonin exhibited higher values of chlorophyll after rehydration we evaluated gas exchanges fig 3 and found that after 20 days of treatment the plants subjected to water deficit treated or not treated with melatonin showed lower photosynthetic rates fig 3a stomatal conductance fig 3b transpiration fig 3c and carboxylation efficiency fig 3d than did ct plants nevertheless m300 plants showed higher a e gs and a ci than did other plants that were under water deficit after rehydration a behavior similar to the previous period was observed in which the plants subjected to the water deficit had lower gas exchanges than the ct plants however the rehydration improved the a e and gs of wd m300 and m500 plants in relation to the period of water deficit but these values did not recover to normal levels after rehydration all the plants subjected to water deficit also exhibited higher rates of carboxylation efficiency however only m300 plants recovered their carboxylation efficiency at normal levels similar to ct plants these data generally suggest that compared to other treatments that were subjected to drought the dose of 300 μm melatonin contributed to relatively lower levels of damage to the photosynthetic apparatus allowing for rubisco carboxylation even under unfavorable irrigation conditions as well as better poststress performance 3 3 the contents of sugars are increased by exogenous melatonin in coffee plants under water deficit sugar levels were compared between ct plants and non irrigated plants treated or not treated with melatonin for sucrose and total soluble sugars after 20 days of treatment the highest sucrose and tss contents fig 4 a c were observed in the leaves of the ct plants followed by the m500 after rehydration we observed an increase in the sucrose and tss contents in the leaves of m300 indicating that lower doses of melatonin promote greater accumulations of sucrose and tss in the leaves presumably in order to maintain their primary metabolism in adverse situations the results in the roots were the opposite of those observed in the leaves fig 4b d at 20 days of treatment wd plants and m300 plants showed higher sucrose and tss values than did ct and m500 plants after rehydration there was a decrease in the sucrose and tss values of wd plants and m300 plants it is possible that the roots of m300 plants used more carbohydrate for their growth during the water deficit however with the rehydration sucrose could have been used for the biosynthesis of other sugar polymers used in energy storage considering the reducing sugars the treatment with 500 μm melatonin promoted lower contents of reducing sugars in the leaves fig 4e of the plants at 20 days of water deficit alternatively after the rehydration the contents of the reducing sugars in the leaves of the ct plants remained constant while the other treatments resulted in a decrease in reducing sugar in relation to the period of water deficit in roots fig 4f at 20 days after the treatments the highest values of reducing sugars were observed in the wd and m300 plants after rehydration the contents of the reducing sugars decreased in all the plants that were previously under water restriction and increased in ct plants the water regime caused a significant reduction in the starch contents in the leaves fig 4g of the coffee seedlings and the water deficit reduced the starch amount for all the treatments the m300 treatment had the highest content of starch at 20 days of water deficit among the plants subjected to water deficit after rehydration a significant increase was observed in the starch values of the plants that were subjected to water deficit regardless of the treatment among the plants subjected to water deficit those not treated with melatonin were the only ones that reached the values of starch exhibited by the control plants by evaluating the starch content in the roots fig 4h we observed that after 20 days of the treatments the plants subjected to the water restriction showed starch values significantly lower than the plants that were under constant irrigation among these plants m300 and m500 had the highest starch content it was also verified that after rehydration all plants subjected to water restriction increased the values of starch in relation to the previous period reaching values similar to those observed in plants regularly irrigated therefore we suggest that during water deficit which caused an energy deficit the plants used their reserves to maintain basic cellular processes in the leaf and exported a large quantity of sugars to the root system an important strategy to guarantee the growth of this organ and for water maintenance of their tissues with rehydration there was an increase in sugar production by the source and homeostasis in carbohydrate metabolism thus reserve polymers such as starch were increased again for use under energy deficit conditions 3 4 melatonin increases antioxidant system activity and reduces lipid peroxidation in coffee seedlings under water deficit changes in the activity of antioxidant enzymes are indicative of the ability to eliminate ros in plants under stressful situations after 20 days of treatment a significant increase in sod activity was observed in the leaves fig 5 a of wd m300 and m500 plants among these plants m300 plants showed the lowest sod activity indicating that these plants had a relatively lower level of stress after rehydration we observed a reduction in sod activity in all plants regardless of treatment nevertheless wd plants maintained higher sod activity than those in the other treatments suggesting that these plants were still subject to oxidative stress even after rehydration in the roots fig 5b after 20 days of treatments wd and m500 plants showed the highest activities of sod alternatively in m300 plants sod activity was similar to that of control plants indicating a low oxidative stress in the roots of these plants the rehydration increased sod activity in wd and m300 plants and reduced them in m500 plants similar to sod apx activity was also modulated by water deficit and melatonin at 20 days after the treatments the apx activity in the leaves fig 5c of m300 plants was similar to that observed in ct plants alternatively m500 plants had even lower peroxidase activities than did wd plants after rehydration the apx activity increased in wd and m500 plants we observed that after 20 days of treatments apx activity was higher in the roots of plants treated with melatonin fig 5d among these plants m300 plants had the highest apx activity in addition after rehydration apx activity was increased in wd and m500 plants and reduced in m300 plants these data suggest that the responses to melatonin are dose dependent therefore smaller doses increased the activity of the antioxidant system and avoided the possible oxidative damages caused by the ros in addition we observed increased cat activity in the leaves fig 5e of all plants subjected to water deficit after 20 days of treatment the m500 plants showed the highest cat activity in the leaves demonstrating that the stress in these plants was more severe than in the others after rehydration we observed that the foliar activity of cat was reduced only in m500 plants in relation to the period of water deficit in the roots fig 5f we found that after 20 days of treatment cat activity was higher in plants subjected to water deficit regardless of whether they were treated with melatonin among the plants subjected to water deficit the m300 plants had the lowest catalase activity in their roots at 20 days of water deficit we also observed that after rehydration there was a reduction in the cat activity in the wd and m500 plants in relation to the period of water restriction regarding the ascorbate levels fig 6 melatonin increased the ascorbate content in leaves and roots in leaves fig 6a m300 plants had the highest ascorbate content under water deficit or after rehydration in the roots fig 6b of plants under water deficit the m300 plants exhibited the highest level of ascorbate after rehydration the ascorbate content was higher in the roots of m300 and m500 plants the transition from the water deficit to rehydration led to an increase in the ascorbate levels in the roots of wd and m500 plants and a decrease in m300 plants these data suggest that treatment with 300 μm of melatonin induces increases in the levels of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants controlling the redox state of the cell the proline content was increased in the leaves fig 6c and roots fig 6d of wd and m500 plants under water deficit in m300 plants proline levels were similar to those in ct plants after rehydration there was an increase in the proline levels in the leaves of the wd and m300 plants and maintenance in m500 plants in the roots we also observed an increase in the proline levels in the wd and m300 plants while there was a decrease in the m500 plants the contents of proline in these plants treated with 300 μm of melatonin were similar to those observed in the control plants indicating the occurrence of less stress in these plants in contrast higher doses of melatonin 500 μm induced significant increases in proline levels in both the leaves and roots signaling the high oxidative stress present in these plants we also observed that after rehydration plants that were subjected to water deficit increased the proline values in both the leaves and roots whether they had been treated with melatonin it was observed that in the leaves even after this increase of the proline contents in the plants subjected to the water deficit those treated with 300 μm of melatonin exhibited the lowest levels of this amino acid however in the roots we observed a reduction of proline content in the plants treated with 500 μm of melatonin and an increase in the plants subjected to water deficit untreated or treated with 300 μm of melatonin mda levels were significantly higher in the leaves fig 6e of the plants subjected to water deficit regardless of treatment with melatonin compared to those of control plants after 20 days of water deficit among the plants subjected to water deficit m300 plants showed the lowest levels of mda in contrast m500 plants exhibited mda levels similar to those observed in wd plants after rehydration we observed a reduction in foliar levels of mda in wd plants reaching values similar to those of m300 plants in the roots fig 6f we observed that wd and m500 plants showed similar values of mda with these values the highest among all the treatments after 20 days of water deficit the treatment with 300 μm of melatonin enabled the plants to exhibit mda contents similar to those observed in the control plants as shown by the low lipid peroxidation of these roots after rehydration the wd and m500 plants reduced the mda contents in their roots however these values did not reach the low levels observed in the ct or m300 plants 4 discussion water restriction critically limits plant growth reducing leaf water potential and may reduce or even suppress crop production in contrast the treatment with melatonin increases the tolerance to water deficit in plants weeda et al 2014 ye et al 2016 liu et al 2015 wei et al 2016 attenuating the effects of this stress and maintaining the turgor pressure in the leaves at satisfactory levels ye et al 2016 this study provided strong evidence that the application of 300 μm of melatonin to the soil promoted increases in drought tolerance in young coffee plants since the plants that received this treatment maintained shoot growth similar to that of the ct plants and had a significant increase in root growth we also observed that the reduction of the leaf water potential was attenuated after 20 days of irrigation suspension by the application of 300 μm of melatonin to the soil thus we suggest that this higher water potential is due to improvements in the root system promoted by melatonin since with the root system well developed and efficient in water capture the balance between the amount absorbed from the soil and lost to the atmosphere is higher this result shows that the application of melatonin reinforces the drought tolerance in coffee trees corroborating the results of ye et al 2016 who found that the foliar application of melatonin in zea mays promotes a reduction of the osmotic potential and the elevation of leaf water potential thus it maintains a greater turgor pressure necessary for the maintenance of stomatal conductance in addition the maintenance of leaf water potential by melatonin may have favored gas exchanges and therefore biochemical reactions since among plants exposed to water deficit those treated with 300 μm of melatonin showed higher stomatal conductance higher photosynthetic and transpiratory rates allowing a greater supply of assimilates for growing tissues with rehydration the application of 300 μm melatonin accelerated the recovery of photosynthesis promoting recovery of the carboxylation efficiency at levels observed in the ct plants this leads us to suggest that in addition to keeping the leaves more hydrated in the wd and m500 plants the application of 300 μm melatonin can alleviate the drought induced lesions in the photosynthetic apparatus using biochemical pathways previous studies have shown that tomato seedlings treated with melatonin maintained photosynthetic transpiratory and stomatal conductance rates higher than untreated plants during the dry season these responses show that the treatment with melatonin provides greater stomatal conductance and contributes to the maintenance of photosynthetic rates during water deficit liu et al 2015 the treatment with melatonin produced a protective effect on the chlorophylls since the contents of the chlorophyll retained in the leaves varied according to the doses of melatonin applied in this context during the period of water deficit m300 plants demonstrated chlorophyll contents similar to those of ct plants the protective effect of melatonin on chlorophyll was also observed in tomato liu et al 2015 and maize ye et al 2016 jiang et al 2016 demonstrating that melatonin slowed lesions in the photosynthetic apparatus in view of the improvement in the photosynthetic rates and leaf water potential observed in the plants treated with 300 μm melatonin we observed that the largest leaf area demonstrated by these plants is a result of the higher water potential and the higher assimilate supply produced by photosynthesis since these plants also had a higher content of reducing sugars in their leaves therefore we suggest that the greater photosynthesis allied to the greater leaf area contributed to the maintenance of the shoot growth and increment of the roots in the plants treated with 300 μm melatonin in relation to the other treatments under water restriction the effects of melatonin on the improvement of the plant tolerance to drought were also observed in maize plants that showed larger leaf areas and dry root and shoot masses under salinity after melatonin treatment jiang et al 2016 in addition weeda et al 2014 reported a substantial influence of melatonin on plant physiological processes by affecting the expression of several genes related to stress response genes and regulating plant growth and development it was also observed in plants treated with 300 μm melatonin that the levels of sucrose and soluble sugars were reduced in the leaves and increased in the roots this behavior can explain the increase in the root shoot ratio observed in these plants highlighting the ability of melatonin in a change in the flow of photoassimilates this phenomenon also helps to explain the reduction in the starch content in the leaves of plants that were under water deficit in relation to those that were well irrigated the reduction in sucrose and starch levels were also verified in coffee trees exposed to drought and low water potential silva et al 2011 this reduction is probably related to the need of the plants to allocate more sucrose to the roots in response to the drought and to the drops in the photosynthetic rates the effects of melatonin in carbohydrate metabolism were dose dependent which was also observed in arabidopsis thaliana exposed to drought salinity cold or pathogen stress notably the role of melatonin in the positive regulation of the expression of stress responsive genes and the accumulation of carbohydrates such as soluble sugars and sucrose was demonstrated shi et al 2015 in young corn plants there was a positive correlation between melatonin dose and sucrose synthesis suggesting that low doses of melatonin benefit growth and promote sugar metabolism photosynthesis and the loading of the sucrose in the phloem zhao et al 2015 it is also important to note that the low photosynthetic assimilation due to the reduction in the carboxylase activity of rubisco causes the accumulation of reducing equivalents therefore resulting in the unavailability of nadp to receive the electrons from the photosynthetic electron transport chain nishiyama et al 2011 these electrons are donated to molecular oxygen o2 reducing it to reactive oxygen species ros nishiyama et al 2011 which in excess can trigger lipid peroxidation chlorophyll degradation and the loss of cellular integrity the plants have a complex system of antioxidant defenses constituted by enzymatic and nonenzymatic components that protect them from the harmful action of these ros sharma et al 2012 in this sense improving antioxidant capacity has been considered the primary function of melatonin in promoting stress tolerance in plants reiter et al 2015 considering the beneficial effects of melatonin on plants under water restriction we observed that the sod activity was lower in the leaves of the plants treated with 300 μm of melatonin corroborating the higher water potential and higher carboxylation efficiency observed in the treated plants in contrast the activity of sod was increased in the roots after rehydration indicating a possible resumption of metabolic processes and therefore greater formation of superoxide in the oxidation reactions it was also observed that the dose of 300 μm of melatonin may have induced a defense against the harmful effects of h2o2 during water deficit as indicated by the higher activities of the cat and apx enzymes contributing to the lower lipid peroxidation observed in the leaves of these plants reinforcing once again the ability of melatonin to induce protection of the photosynthetic apparatus by biochemical pathways in contrast the activities of cat and apx in the roots were reduced to values similar to those demonstrated by the plants of the irrigated control treatment indicating a reduction of the oxidative stress in these plants the attenuating effect of melatonin on oxidative stress was also described in zea mays l under drought ye et al 2016 and saline stress jiang et al 2016 in tomatoes under drought liu et al 2015 in pisum sativum under oxidative stress szafrańska et al 2016 and in cucumis sativus zhang et al 2013 and malus domestica under drought wang et al 2013 and the antioxidant capacity in these plants was increased by the increased activities of the antioxidant system enzymes including sod cat and apx since melatonin had an influence on the enzymatic antioxidant system we also verified its action under the nonenzymatic antioxidant system in which ascorbate was used as an evaluation parameter ascorbate is a non enzymatic antioxidant that participates in the ascorbate glutathione cycle in the neutralization of ros thus contributing to the reduction of oxidative stress sharma et al 2012 in this study the treatment with 300 μm of melatonin promoted the greatest stimulus for the synthesis of ascorbate in the leaves and roots in either drought conditions or after rehydration collaborating to reduce oxidative damage malus domestica plants exposed to melatonin also exhibited increased ascorbate levels in leaves exposed to melatonin even during the first 12 h of treatment wang et al 2012 this observation indicates that melatonin in addition to increasing the activity of the antioxidant enzymes induces an increase in the levels of other nonenzymatic antioxidants in order to reduce the oxidative damages caused by the stresses in addition to the response of the antioxidant system the ability of plants to withstand drought involves the accumulation of solutes to reduce the osmotic potential and maintain cellular turgor under optimal conditions among these solutes proline accumulates in the cytosol under stress conditions increasing the ability of plants to resist dehydration thus minimizing the damages caused by excess ions burritt 2012 in coffee plants proline levels increase proportionally to the reduction of water potential silva et al 2011 in this study the treatment with 300 μm of melatonin induced lower proline accumulation in both the roots and leaves indicating a reduction in the effects of water deficit noted by the low water potential of these plants melatonin also contributed to lower proline accumulation in prunus avium and prunus cerasus sarroopoulou et al 2012 as it increases antioxidant defense and contributes to greater water potential in parallel we noticed that the treatment with 300 μm melatonin reduced the accumulation of mda in the leaves of the plants exposed to water deficit justifying the smallest biochemical damage to photosynthesis demonstrated by the higher carboxylation efficiency of the plants of this treatment furthermore the roots presented normal levels of lipid peroxidation since the mda content produced by the plants treated with 300 μm of melatonin was similar to that produced by the roots of well irrigated control plants these results enable us to explain the higher root growth of these plants as well as their lower water potential thus we suggest that the plants of this treatment did not suffer damage from exposure to water restriction unlike those plants that were not treated or treated with 500 μm melatonin because they demonstrated approximately 50 more lipid peroxidation changes in lipid peroxidation levels demonstrate the extent of the damage caused by oxidative stress in general melatonin treatment reduces mda contents in plants as observed in cucumis sativus l zhang et al 2013 and zea mays l ye et al 2016 recently it has been proposed that melatonin in arabidopsis thaliana induces the transcription of genes involved in stress responses resulting in carbohydrate accumulation shi et al 2015 it was also demonstrated that not all genes altered by the high concentrations of melatonin are altered by low concentrations indicating that melatonin regulates plant growth and development depending on the dose applied weeda et al 2014 in rice it has been shown that melatonin regulated genes may play important roles in plant development when exposed to stress wei et al 2016 in pisum sativum l melatonin application stabilized the photosynthetic pigments amplified the responses to oxidative damages and reduced the accumulation of superoxide in the foliar tissues szafrańska et al 2016 a recent model proposed by arnao and hernández ruiz 2014 provides evidence for this trend and suggests that melatonin acts as an antioxidant biostimulator and regulator of plant growth under biotic or abiotic stresses here our results demonstrate that melatonin contributes to the improvement of drought tolerance in plants the 300 μm dose of melatonin maintained the photosynthetic capacity under water deficit by increasing the carboxylation efficiency and chlorophyll content the application of melatonin in coffee plants under water deficit reinforced the activity of antioxidant enzymes and non enzymatic antioxidant compounds reinforcing their biostimulating function on the expression of the genes of the antioxidant system thus reducing the lesions caused by eros in addition the treatment with 300 μm melatonin contributed to a greater control between the loss and absorption of water demonstrating its participation in the regulation of the water condition of plants in drought conditions to our knowledge this study represents the first demonstration of the protective effect of melatonin on coffea arabica l plants under drought conditions thus our results suggest that melatonin may improve drought tolerance and may be considered a potential regulator of agricultural production under water deficit contributions all authors contributed in conducting the experiment performing the biochemical analysis and

11282,water deficit severely compromises the homeostatic balance of plants and suggests a redox imbalance in cells melatonin is described as a promoter of stress tolerance in plants that induces the expression of stress related genes reduces lipid peroxidation and increases the antioxidant system to analyze the influence of exogenous melatonin on the promotion of tolerance to water deficit we applied concentrations of 300 μm and 500 μm to coffea arabica l seedlings here we show that the intensity of the short term responses to melatonin may vary according to the concentration of melatonin we also report that lower concentrations of melatonin 300 μm promote an increase in the root system and the protection of the photosynthetic apparatus allowing greater gas exchange greater carboxylation efficiency and higher chlorophyll contents moreover melatonin improved the activity of the enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant systems and reduced lipid peroxidation in addition we demonstrated that higher concentrations 500 μm caused negative effects on stress tolerance thus demonstrating a toxic level overall these results demonstrated that melatonin mediates the signaling for water deficit responses by acting as an inductor of tolerance most likely enhanced by increased carboxylation efficiency and antioxidant systems this study provides evidence that exogenous melatonin protects coffee against water deficit keywords antioxidant water deficit gas exchange carbohydrate metabolism coffee 1 introduction coffee has great importance for the world and stands out as the second most traded commodity worldwide coffee belongs to the genus coffea and has two large species of world importance coffea arabica and coffea canefora known as arabica coffee and conilon respectively conab 2015 however the coffee plantations of brazil are comprised primarily of cultivars of coffea arabica this species offers products of good quality and great acceptance by the consumer market nogueira 2005 arabica coffee beans produce finer and more refined beverages as well as having an intense aroma and the most varied types of tastes body and acidity semmelroch and grosch 1996 genetic and breeding researchers have developed several coffee cultivars and lines from the arabica variety including the cultivar catuaí nogueira 2005 the catuaí coffee cultivar shows great adaptability as well as high productivity in most of the coffee regions in brazil and around the world this cultivar exhibits short height allowing a higher density of planting and facilitating crop and phytosanitary treatments in addition the catuaí cultivar offers important characteristics such as producing abundantly during the first years of harvest being less affected by deficiencies of calcium magnesium and zinc and being more resistant to coffee rust blank et al 1991 such characteristics arouse great interest in this coffee cultivar among coffee producers around the world for maintaining this productivity growers tend to expand its cultivation to increasing areas resulting in exposure to edaphoclimatic adversities water scarcity is one of the most severe adversities water scarcity is a limiting environmental factor and severely compromises the homeostatic balance of the plants in general responses to water deficit begin with the increased endogenous production of abscisic acid aba which induces the increased expression of several water stress response genes and activates a signaling cascade that leads to reduced stomatal conductance gs and consequently internal carbon dioxide concentration ci osakabe et al 2014 in addition there is a reduction in the carboxylation activity of the ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco enzyme due to the low levels of its substrate co2 xu et al 2013 to function with this reduction in the carboxylation activity of rubisco naph accumulates and nadp is unavailable to receive the electrons from the end of the photochemical stage resulting in electron accumulation porcar castell et al 2014 these electrons are then donated to molecular oxygen generating superoxide radicals which together with other reactive species can damage the photosynthetic apparatus as well as the peroxidation of lipid membranes and chlorophylls nishiyama et al 2011 due to this low photosynthetic assimilation there is a reduction in the synthesis of sucrose and deprivation of the supply of soluble sugars to maintain metabolism hammond and white 2008 additionally this disaccharide can be hydrolyzed to form hexoses and allocated in reserve organs for later uses xu et al 2015 this allocation of assimilates from the aerial part to the roots can increase root growth by increasing water uptake by roots to control these imbalances caused by low photosynthetic assimilation and other physiological processes that lead to the formation of ros plants have a cellular antioxidant defense system consisting of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase sod ascorbate peroxidase apx and catalase cat and nonenzymatic components such as ascorbate and glutathione which together act to neutralize the reactive oxygen species ros protecting the cells from possible oxidative damage sharma et al 2012 in addition to these antioxidant defense mechanisms the plant s tolerance to water deficit involves the accumulation of organic solutes such as proline that function to maintain its osmotic adjustment in this sense proline increases the resistance to dehydration helping to reduce the water potential since it allows the movement of water to the interior of the cells minimizing the damage caused by excess ions burritt 2012 proline forms a layer of hydration around proteins preventing them from being damaged by the stress conditions burritt 2012 in this manner the drought increases the accumulation of osmolytes for water retention or to avoid excessive loss of water melatonin n acetyl 5 methoxytryptamine is described as a stress tolerance promoter in plants arnao and hernández ruiz 2014 jiang et al 2016 shi et al 2015 since its synthesis is induced in plants exposed to biotic and abiotic stresses melatonin acts to limit oxidative stress by inducing the expression of stress related genes increasing the enzymatic antioxidant system and reducing lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 levels reiter et al 2015 melatonin positively regulates the mrna expression of several biotic and abiotic stress response genes such as the c repeat binding factors cbfs drought response element binding factors dreb1 s in arabidopsis thaliana shi et al 2015 increases the activity of antioxidant enzymes wang et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 and reduces the levels of malondialdehyde mda jiang et al 2016 and h2o2 wang et al 2013 in addition melatonin induces increased levels of ascorbate since this molecule is a secondary antioxidant that signals retrograde to the nucleus under low photosynthetic status moreover plants treated with melatonin showed higher growth rates than those not treated wang et al 2016 probably enhanced by the increased sugar metabolism and photosynthetic rates zhao et al 2015 although the benefits of melatonin in mitigating the damage caused by abiotic stresses are known there is no data in the literature regarding the induction of the tolerance to water deficit in coffee in light of the responses triggered by melatonin in plants exposed to low water status concentrations of 300 μm and 500 μm melatonin were applied to coffee seedlings to analyze the influence of exogenous melatonin on the promotion of the tolerance to water deficit therefore we show that the intensity of the short term responses to melatonin may vary according to the concentration of melatonin overall these results demonstrated that melatonin mediates the signaling for drought stress responses by acting as an inductor of tolerance most likely enhanced by increased carboxylation efficiency antioxidant system and root systems this study provides evidence of water deficit protection in coffee by exogenous melatonin 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design seedlings of coffea arabica l cv catuaí 144 were transferred to polypropylene pots containing 3 kg of standard substrate for coffee seedlings consisting of sifted subsoil sand and tanned corral manure and sieved in ratios of 2 1 1 plus fertilizer containing nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in the proportions 4 14 8 after transplantation the plants were acclimated for four weeks and then were subjected to the following treatments control ct in which the plants were irrigated and the substrate moisture was maintained close to the field capacity water deficit wd in which the plants were kept at 40 of the maximum moisture retention capacity melatonin at 300 μm water deficit m300 where melatonin was applied to the soil and the plants were maintained at 40 moisture retention capacity and melatonin at 500 μm water deficit m500 in which melatonin was applied to the soil and the plants were maintained at 40 of the maximum moisture retention capacity the determination of the ct condition in which the soil was maintained close to the maximum moisture retention capacity was performed using the direct method a soil sample was oven dried weighed and placed in a container with water and the surface of the container was covered by a plastic bag to avoid evaporation until it reached saturation by capillarity the maximum water retention capacity was determined by the difference between the dry and the saturated weight the melatonin stock solution was prepared by dissolving melatonin in ethanol 50 mg of melatonin in 1 ml of ethanol after the stock solution was prepared it was diluted to obtain the appropriate concentrations that were used for the application and the volume was brought to 100 ml with distilled water in each pot 100 ml of melatonin solution was applied directly to the soil in a single application before the treatments all the pots were weighed to maintain the humidity at 100 following this procedure melatonin was applied at concentrations of 300 and 500 μm and the weight of the pots was monitored daily to maintain them at 40 of field capacity in the water deficit treatment plants not treated with melatonin 100 ml of distilled water were applied so that they had the same soil moisture as those treated with melatonin the evaluation and data collection were performed in two periods the first evaluation was performed twenty days after the treatments when the first symptoms appeared and all the pots were irrigated until the soil reached the field capacity the second evaluation was performed 24 h after rehydration the experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design crd and carried out in a 4 2 factorial scheme with four treatments ct wd m300 and m500 two collection times 20 and 21 days of treatment and three replicates each experimental unit consisted of two pots containing one plant each with one plant used for destructive analysis and the other for nondestructive analysis totaling 48 plants the variables were analyzed for normality

increases leaf water potential and promotes growth in coffee plants under water deficit to understand the role of melatonin in water deficit tolerance in coffee seedlings we subjected 6 month old coffee seedlings to water restriction conditions with or without the application of melatonin to the soil the leaves of three plants were collected before the treatments were applied to verify that they did not differ in their water potential a leaf of each plant was collected two hours before dawn when the leaf water potential was maximal kramer and boyer 1995 and the samples did not differ in either water potential or dry matter groups of plants were subjected to water deficit 40 maximum soil moisture retention capacity water deficit with the application of 300 μm melatonin m300 and water deficit with the application of 500 μm melatonin m500 the control group ct was maintained in optimal water conditions that correspond to soil that contains 100 of its moisture retention capacity after 20 days of treatment it was verified that the plants that were under water restriction showed lower values of water potential fig 1 than those kept in a normal water condition ct independently of the treatment it was also observed that the plants of m300 treatment showed values of water potential higher than those verified in wd plants whereas the plants of m500 treatment exhibited water potential values similar to those observed in wd plants this suggests that the effect of melatonin on water potential depends on the dose applied after this period when the plants were rehydrated it was verified that the water potential of the plants subjected to water deficit had increased reaching the same values of the water potential of the ct plants after 21 days of treatment ct plants and m300 plants had higher values of dry shoot matter than wd plants or m500 plants table 1 treatment with melatonin also influenced root growth table 1 we observed that the plants subjected to the water deficit had higher values of root dry matter than ct plants m300 plants had higher values of root dry matter than any of the other treatments nevertheless in plants subjected to water deficit not treated or treated with melatonin the root shoot dry matter ratio table 1 was higher than that in ct plants thus the data suggest that under conditions of water restriction plants invest in root growth as a morphological strategy to increase the efficiency of water absorption we also observed that there was a reduction in leaf area in response to the water deficit however m300 plants showed higher values of total leaf area table 1 when compared to wd or m500 plants thus we suggest that the dose of 300 μm melatonin guarantees the homeostatic balance of the vegetative tissue during conditions of water deficit which contributes to its growth in this condition 3 2 melatonin increases chlorophyll content and improves gas exchange in coffee seedlings under water deficit the results showed that after 20 days of treatments ct plants and m300 plants had higher chlorophyll values fig 2 than wd plants and m500 plants after 24 h of rehydration we observed that the plants that were under water restriction showed a rapid increase in chlorophyll content regardless of the treatment and the highest values were observed in m300 plants followed by m500 plants these results demonstrate that melatonin is possibly related to the maintenance of the photosynthetic pigments or the expression of genes involved in the biosynthetic route since the plants that received melatonin exhibited higher values of chlorophyll after rehydration we evaluated gas exchanges fig 3 and found that after 20 days of treatment the plants subjected to water deficit treated or not treated with melatonin showed lower photosynthetic rates fig 3a stomatal conductance fig 3b transpiration fig 3c and carboxylation efficiency fig 3d than did ct plants nevertheless m300 plants showed higher a e gs and a ci than did other plants that were under water deficit after rehydration a behavior similar to the previous period was observed in which the plants subjected to the water deficit had lower gas exchanges than the ct plants however the rehydration improved the a e and gs of wd m300 and m500 plants in relation to the period of water deficit but these values did not recover to normal levels after rehydration all the plants subjected to water deficit also exhibited higher rates of carboxylation efficiency however only m300 plants recovered their carboxylation efficiency at normal levels similar to ct plants these data generally suggest that compared to other treatments that were subjected to drought the dose of 300 μm melatonin contributed to relatively lower levels of damage to the photosynthetic apparatus allowing for rubisco carboxylation even under unfavorable irrigation conditions as well as better poststress performance 3 3 the contents of sugars are increased by exogenous melatonin in coffee plants under water deficit sugar levels were compared between ct plants and non irrigated plants treated or not treated with melatonin for sucrose and total soluble sugars after 20 days of treatment the highest sucrose and tss contents fig 4 a c were observed in the leaves of the ct plants followed by the m500 after rehydration we observed an increase in the sucrose and tss contents in the leaves of m300 indicating that lower doses of melatonin promote greater accumulations of sucrose and tss in the leaves presumably in order to maintain their primary metabolism in adverse situations the results in the roots were the opposite of those observed in the leaves fig 4b d at 20 days of treatment wd plants and m300 plants showed higher sucrose and tss values than did ct and m500 plants after rehydration there was a decrease in the sucrose and tss values of wd plants and m300 plants it is possible that the roots of m300 plants used more carbohydrate for their growth during the water deficit however with the rehydration sucrose could have been used for the biosynthesis of other sugar polymers used in energy storage considering the reducing sugars the treatment with 500 μm melatonin promoted lower contents of reducing sugars in the leaves fig 4e of the plants at 20 days of water deficit alternatively after the rehydration the contents of the reducing sugars in the leaves of the ct plants remained constant while the other treatments resulted in a decrease in reducing sugar in relation to the period of water deficit in roots fig 4f at 20 days after the treatments the highest values of reducing sugars were observed in the wd and m300 plants after rehydration the contents of the reducing sugars decreased in all the plants that were previously under water restriction and increased in ct plants the water regime caused a significant reduction in the starch contents in the leaves fig 4g of the coffee seedlings and the water deficit reduced the starch amount for all the treatments the m300 treatment had the highest content of starch at 20 days of water deficit among the plants subjected to water deficit after rehydration a significant increase was observed in the starch values of the plants that were subjected to water deficit regardless of the treatment among the plants subjected to water deficit those not treated with melatonin were the only ones that reached the values of starch exhibited by the control plants by evaluating the starch content in the roots fig 4h we observed that after 20 days of the treatments the plants subjected to the water restriction showed starch values significantly lower than the plants that were under constant irrigation among these plants m300 and m500 had the highest starch content it was also verified that after rehydration all plants subjected to water restriction increased the values of starch in relation to the previous period reaching values similar to those observed in plants regularly irrigated therefore we suggest that during water deficit which caused an energy deficit the plants used their reserves to maintain basic cellular processes in the leaf and exported a large quantity of sugars to the root system an important strategy to guarantee the growth of this organ and for water maintenance of their tissues with rehydration there was an increase in sugar production by the source and homeostasis in carbohydrate metabolism thus reserve polymers such as starch were increased again for use under energy deficit conditions 3 4 melatonin increases antioxidant system activity and reduces lipid peroxidation in coffee seedlings under water deficit changes in the activity of antioxidant enzymes are indicative of the ability to eliminate ros in plants under stressful situations after 20 days of treatment a significant increase in sod activity was observed in the leaves fig 5 a of wd m300 and m500 plants among these plants m300 plants showed the lowest sod activity indicating that these plants had a relatively lower level of stress after rehydration we observed a reduction in sod activity in all plants regardless of treatment nevertheless wd plants maintained higher sod activity than those in the other treatments suggesting that these plants were still subject to oxidative stress even after rehydration in the roots fig 5b after 20 days of treatments wd and m500 plants showed the highest activities of sod alternatively in m300 plants sod activity was similar to that of control plants indicating a low oxidative stress in the roots of these plants the rehydration increased sod activity in wd and m300 plants and reduced them in m500 plants similar to sod apx activity was also modulated by water deficit and melatonin at 20 days after the treatments the apx activity in the leaves fig 5c of m300 plants was similar to that observed in ct plants alternatively m500 plants had even lower peroxidase activities than did wd plants after rehydration the apx activity increased in wd and m500 plants we observed that after 20 days of treatments apx activity was higher in the roots of plants treated with melatonin fig 5d among these plants m300 plants had the highest apx activity in addition after rehydration apx activity was increased in wd and m500 plants and reduced in m300 plants these data suggest that the responses to melatonin are dose dependent therefore smaller doses increased the activity of the antioxidant system and avoided the possible oxidative damages caused by the ros in addition we observed increased cat activity in the leaves fig 5e of all plants subjected to water deficit after 20 days of treatment the m500 plants showed the highest cat activity in the leaves demonstrating that the stress in these plants was more severe than in the others after rehydration we observed that the foliar activity of cat was reduced only in m500 plants in relation to the period of water deficit in the roots fig 5f we found that after 20 days of treatment cat activity was higher in plants subjected to water deficit regardless of whether they were treated with melatonin among the plants subjected to water deficit the m300 plants had the lowest catalase activity in their roots at 20 days of water deficit we also observed that after rehydration there was a reduction in the cat activity in the wd and m500 plants in relation to the period of water restriction regarding the ascorbate levels fig 6 melatonin increased the ascorbate content in leaves and roots in leaves fig 6a m300 plants had the highest ascorbate content under water deficit or after rehydration in the roots fig 6b of plants under water deficit the m300 plants exhibited the highest level of ascorbate after rehydration the ascorbate content was higher in the roots of m300 and m500 plants the transition from the water deficit to rehydration led to an increase in the ascorbate levels in the roots of wd and m500 plants and a decrease in m300 plants these data suggest that treatment with 300 μm of melatonin induces increases in the levels of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants controlling the redox state of the cell the proline content was increased in the leaves fig 6c and roots fig 6d of wd and m500 plants under water deficit in m300 plants proline levels were similar to those in ct plants after rehydration there was an increase in the proline levels in the leaves of the wd and m300 plants and maintenance in m500 plants in the roots we also observed an increase in the proline levels in the wd and m300 plants while there was a decrease in the m500 plants the contents of proline in these plants treated with 300 μm of melatonin were similar to those observed in the control plants indicating the occurrence of less stress in these plants in contrast higher doses of melatonin 500 μm induced significant increases in proline levels in both the leaves and roots signaling the high oxidative stress present in these plants we also observed that after rehydration plants that were subjected to water deficit increased the proline values in both the leaves and roots whether they had been treated with melatonin it was observed that in the leaves even after this increase of the proline contents in the plants subjected to the water deficit those treated with 300 μm of melatonin exhibited the lowest levels of this amino acid however in the roots we observed a reduction of proline content in the plants treated with 500 μm of melatonin and an increase in the plants subjected to water deficit untreated or treated with 300 μm of melatonin mda levels were significantly higher in the leaves fig 6e of the plants subjected to water deficit regardless of treatment with melatonin compared to those of control plants after 20 days of water deficit among the plants subjected to water deficit m300 plants showed the lowest levels of mda in contrast m500 plants exhibited mda levels similar to those observed in wd plants after rehydration we observed a reduction in foliar levels of mda in wd plants reaching values similar to those of m300 plants in the roots fig 6f we observed that wd and m500 plants showed similar values of mda with these values the highest among all the treatments after 20 days of water deficit the treatment with 300 μm of melatonin enabled the plants to exhibit mda contents similar to those observed in the control plants as shown by the low lipid peroxidation of these roots after rehydration the wd and m500 plants reduced the mda contents in their roots however these values did not reach the low levels observed in the ct or m300 plants 4 discussion water restriction critically limits plant growth reducing leaf water potential and may reduce or even suppress crop production in contrast the treatment with melatonin increases the tolerance to water deficit in plants weeda et al 2014 ye et al 2016 liu et al 2015 wei et al 2016 attenuating the effects of this stress and maintaining the turgor pressure in the leaves at satisfactory levels ye et al 2016 this study provided strong evidence that the application of 300 μm of melatonin to the soil promoted increases in drought tolerance in young coffee plants since the plants that received this treatment maintained shoot growth similar to that of the ct plants and had a significant increase in root growth we also observed that the reduction of the leaf water potential was attenuated after 20 days of irrigation suspension by the application of 300 μm of melatonin to the soil thus we suggest that this higher water potential is due to improvements in the root system promoted by melatonin since with the root system well developed and efficient in water capture the balance between the amount absorbed from the soil and lost to the atmosphere is higher this result shows that the application of melatonin reinforces the drought tolerance in coffee trees corroborating the results of ye et al 2016 who found that the foliar application of melatonin in zea mays promotes a reduction of the osmotic potential and the elevation of leaf water potential thus it maintains a greater turgor pressure necessary for the maintenance of stomatal conductance in addition the maintenance of leaf water potential by melatonin may have favored gas exchanges and therefore biochemical reactions since among plants exposed to water deficit those treated with 300 μm of melatonin showed higher stomatal conductance higher photosynthetic and transpiratory rates allowing a greater supply of assimilates for growing tissues with rehydration the application of 300 μm melatonin accelerated the recovery of photosynthesis promoting recovery of the carboxylation efficiency at levels observed in the ct plants this leads us to suggest that in addition to keeping the leaves more hydrated in the wd and m500 plants the application of 300 μm melatonin can alleviate the drought induced lesions in the photosynthetic apparatus using biochemical pathways previous studies have shown that tomato seedlings treated with melatonin maintained photosynthetic transpiratory and stomatal conductance rates higher than untreated plants during the dry season these responses show that the treatment with melatonin provides greater stomatal conductance and contributes to the maintenance of photosynthetic rates during water deficit liu et al 2015 the treatment with melatonin produced a protective effect on the chlorophylls since the contents of the chlorophyll retained in the leaves varied according to the doses of melatonin applied in this context during the period of water deficit m300 plants demonstrated chlorophyll contents similar to those of ct plants the protective effect of melatonin on chlorophyll was also observed in tomato liu et al 2015 and maize ye et al 2016 jiang et al 2016 demonstrating that melatonin slowed lesions in the photosynthetic apparatus in view of the improvement in the photosynthetic rates and leaf water potential observed in the plants treated with 300 μm melatonin we observed that the largest leaf area demonstrated by these plants is a result of the higher water potential and the higher assimilate supply produced by photosynthesis since these plants also had a higher content of reducing sugars in their leaves therefore we suggest that the greater photosynthesis allied to the greater leaf area contributed to the maintenance of the shoot growth and increment of the roots in the plants treated with 300 μm melatonin in relation to the other treatments under water restriction the effects of melatonin on the improvement of the plant tolerance to drought were also observed in maize plants that showed larger leaf areas and dry root and shoot masses under salinity after melatonin treatment jiang et al 2016 in addition weeda et al 2014 reported a substantial influence of melatonin on plant physiological processes by affecting the expression of several genes related to stress response genes and regulating plant growth and development it was also observed in plants treated with 300 μm melatonin that the levels of sucrose and soluble sugars were reduced in the leaves and increased in the roots this behavior can explain the increase in the root shoot ratio observed in these plants highlighting the ability of melatonin in a change in the flow of photoassimilates this phenomenon also helps to explain the reduction in the starch content in the leaves of plants that were under water deficit in relation to those that were well irrigated the reduction in sucrose and starch levels were also verified in coffee trees exposed to drought and low water potential silva et al 2011 this reduction is probably related to the need of the plants to allocate more sucrose to the roots in response to the drought and to the drops in the photosynthetic rates the effects of melatonin in carbohydrate metabolism were dose dependent which was also observed in arabidopsis thaliana exposed to drought salinity cold or pathogen stress notably the role of melatonin in the positive regulation of the expression of stress responsive genes and the accumulation of carbohydrates such as soluble sugars and sucrose was demonstrated shi et al 2015 in young corn plants there was a positive correlation between melatonin dose and sucrose synthesis suggesting that low doses of melatonin benefit growth and promote sugar metabolism photosynthesis and the loading of the sucrose in the phloem zhao et al 2015 it is also important to note that the low photosynthetic assimilation due to the reduction in the carboxylase activity of rubisco causes the accumulation of reducing equivalents therefore resulting in the unavailability of nadp to receive the electrons from the photosynthetic electron transport chain nishiyama et al 2011 these electrons are donated to molecular oxygen o2 reducing it to reactive oxygen species ros nishiyama et al 2011 which in excess can trigger lipid peroxidation chlorophyll degradation and the loss of cellular integrity the plants have a complex system of antioxidant defenses constituted by enzymatic and nonenzymatic components that protect them from the harmful action of these ros sharma et al 2012 in this sense improving antioxidant capacity has been considered the primary function of melatonin in promoting stress tolerance in plants reiter et al 2015 considering the beneficial effects of melatonin on plants under water restriction we observed that the sod activity was lower in the leaves of the plants treated with 300 μm of melatonin corroborating the higher water potential and higher carboxylation efficiency observed in the treated plants in contrast the activity of sod was increased in the roots after rehydration indicating a possible resumption of metabolic processes and therefore greater formation of superoxide in the oxidation reactions it was also observed that the dose of 300 μm of melatonin may have induced a defense against the harmful effects of h2o2 during water deficit as indicated by the higher activities of the cat and apx enzymes contributing to the lower lipid peroxidation observed in the leaves of these plants reinforcing once again the ability of melatonin to induce protection of the photosynthetic apparatus by biochemical pathways in contrast the activities of cat and apx in the roots were reduced to values similar to those demonstrated by the plants of the irrigated control treatment indicating a reduction of the oxidative stress in these plants the attenuating effect of melatonin on oxidative stress was also described in zea mays l under drought ye et al 2016 and saline stress jiang et al 2016 in tomatoes under drought liu et al 2015 in pisum sativum under oxidative stress szafrańska et al 2016 and in cucumis sativus zhang et al 2013 and malus domestica under drought wang et al 2013 and the antioxidant capacity in these plants was increased by the increased activities of the antioxidant system enzymes including sod cat and apx since melatonin had an influence on the enzymatic antioxidant system we also verified its action under the nonenzymatic antioxidant system in which ascorbate was used as an evaluation parameter ascorbate is a non enzymatic antioxidant that participates in the ascorbate glutathione cycle in the neutralization of ros thus contributing to the reduction of oxidative stress sharma et al 2012 in this study the treatment with 300 μm of melatonin promoted the greatest stimulus for the synthesis of ascorbate in the leaves and roots in either drought conditions or after rehydration collaborating to reduce oxidative damage malus domestica plants exposed to melatonin also exhibited increased ascorbate levels in leaves exposed to melatonin even during the first 12 h of treatment wang et al 2012 this observation indicates that melatonin in addition to increasing the activity of the antioxidant enzymes induces an increase in the levels of other nonenzymatic antioxidants in order to reduce the oxidative damages caused by the stresses in addition to the response of the antioxidant system the ability of plants to withstand drought involves the accumulation of solutes to reduce the osmotic potential and maintain cellular turgor under optimal conditions among these solutes proline accumulates in the cytosol under stress conditions increasing the ability of plants to resist dehydration thus minimizing the damages caused by excess ions burritt 2012 in coffee plants proline levels increase proportionally to the reduction of water potential silva et al 2011 in this study the treatment with 300 μm of melatonin induced lower proline accumulation in both the roots and leaves indicating a reduction in the effects of water deficit noted by the low water potential of these plants melatonin also contributed to lower proline accumulation in prunus avium and prunus cerasus sarroopoulou et al 2012 as it increases antioxidant defense and contributes to greater water potential in parallel we noticed that the treatment with 300 μm melatonin reduced the accumulation of mda in the leaves of the plants exposed to water deficit justifying the smallest biochemical damage to photosynthesis demonstrated by the higher carboxylation efficiency of the plants of this treatment furthermore the roots presented normal levels of lipid peroxidation since the mda content produced by the plants treated with 300 μm of melatonin was similar to that produced by the roots of well irrigated control plants these results enable us to explain the higher root growth of these plants as well as their lower water potential thus we suggest that the plants of this treatment did not suffer damage from exposure to water restriction unlike those plants that were not treated or treated with 500 μm melatonin because they demonstrated approximately 50 more lipid peroxidation changes in lipid peroxidation levels demonstrate the extent of the damage caused by oxidative stress in general melatonin treatment reduces mda contents in plants as observed in cucumis sativus l zhang et al 2013 and zea mays l ye et al 2016 recently it has been proposed that melatonin in arabidopsis thaliana induces the transcription of genes involved in stress responses resulting in carbohydrate accumulation shi et al 2015 it was also demonstrated that not all genes altered by the high concentrations of melatonin are altered by low concentrations indicating that melatonin regulates plant growth and development depending on the dose applied weeda et al 2014 in rice it has been shown that melatonin regulated genes may play important roles in plant development when exposed to stress wei et al 2016 in pisum sativum l melatonin application stabilized the photosynthetic pigments amplified the responses to oxidative damages and reduced the accumulation of superoxide in the foliar tissues szafrańska et al 2016 a recent model proposed by arnao and hernández ruiz 2014 provides evidence for this trend and suggests that melatonin acts as an antioxidant biostimulator and regulator of plant growth under biotic or abiotic stresses here our results demonstrate that melatonin contributes to the improvement of drought tolerance in plants the 300 μm dose of melatonin maintained the photosynthetic capacity under water deficit by increasing the carboxylation efficiency and chlorophyll content the application of melatonin in coffee plants under water deficit reinforced the activity of antioxidant enzymes and non enzymatic antioxidant compounds reinforcing their biostimulating function on the expression of the genes of the antioxidant system thus reducing the lesions caused by eros in addition the treatment with 300 μm melatonin contributed to a greater control between the loss and absorption of water demonstrating its participation in the regulation of the water condition of plants in drought conditions to our knowledge this study represents the first demonstration of the protective effect of melatonin on coffea arabica l plants under drought conditions thus our results suggest that melatonin may improve drought tolerance and may be considered a potential regulator of agricultural production under water deficit contributions all authors contributed in conducting the experiment performing the biochemical analysis and

11283,man made water reservoirs called ab bandan in mazandaran province northern iran are used to collect precipitation for irrigating rice fields in spite of their importance ab bandans face governance difficulties such as the lack of a specific law the lack of long term and strategic planning and low recognition of these reservoirs at the national level therefore water policy instruments are argued to be needed in order to overcome the barriers and improve water governance this paper aims to identify and assess relevant policy instruments for the improvement of the governance of ab bandans by conducting an exploratory sequential research design based on interviews with 30 regional experts 31 policy instruments are identified and grouped into three reinforcing dimensions of water governance effectiveness efficiency and trust and engagement afterwards these policy instruments are assessed by a larger sample of participants through snowball sampling n 169 confirmatory factor analysis reveals that in survey participants opinion 28 out of 31 policy instruments identified properly represent three reinforcing dimensions of water governance the results indicate that the enhancement of collective action among farmers is the policy instrument which contributes more to the improvement of governance furthermore the dimensions are positively related to one another therefore the policy instruments are interdependent and should be addressed in a holistic way keywords water policy good governance confirmatory factor analysis ab bandan mazandaran 1 introduction water is the main component required for most activities in human society all societies need water for basic survival and economic development chenoweth 2008 thus the water crisis is one of the key problems of global relevance in the 21 st century orr et al 2009 the water crisis is not due to water shortage because sufficient water exists for all people even in areas where there is a temporary shortage of water but a crisis of governance e g fragmented institutional structures and weak regulatory framework result in or exacerbate problems of water availability oecd 2011 scholars in the water sector highlighted the fact that enhancing water governance is the solution to the water crisis akhmouch 2012 araral and yu 2013 biswas and tortajada 2010 oecd 2015 rogers and hall 2003 saleth and dinar 2005 the government of iran blames the current water crisis on the changing climate frequent droughts and international sanctions in order to hide the inefficient water management system in the country madani 2014 many iranian experts claim that a failure of water governance is the more significant cause of water crisis foltz 2002 madani 2014 pointed out that the water crisis in iran is rooted in managerial political and institutional determinants rather than engineering and technical issues although the climate has varied over the centuries iran has always been located in an arid and semi arid region therefore it should not be assumed as is often the case that water is scarce in iran yazdanpanah et al 2013 the average annual precipitation of the country is approximately 417 billion cubic meters bcm of which 117 bcm of the precipitation is directly accessible of which 92 bcm flows as surface water resources and 25 bcm infiltrates into groundwater resources ardakanian 2005 in contrast to most provinces the mazandaran province located in northern iran which is the most important region for rice production in the country has a high annual average precipitation of 749 9 mm ministry of agriculture iran 2015 ministry of energy iran 2015 a considerable amount of the precipitation in mazandaran occurs during the non growing seasons autumn and winter azmoodeh et al 2009 in order to collect this precipitation to be used for irrigating rice fields during the growing seasons spring and summer there are man made reservoirs called ab bandan abbasian et al 2014 in spite of these reservoirs a significant amount of precipitation runs off into the sea through rivers without being stored azmoodeh et al 2009 sometimes even causing water logging or flooding ministry of agriculture iran 2016 this province has a potential of 4 9 billion m3 as surface water resources and of which around 2 2 billion m3 is being stored and the remaining water flows into the sea ejlali et al 2016 according to a number of regional experts ab bandans are not well governed due to the lack of a specific law the lack of long term and strategic planning of administrative bodies low recognition of ab bandans at the national level financial problems for rehabilitation of ab bandans lack of water user associations little relevance of academic research on ab bandans to practice and poor use of water technology mirzaei et al 2017 the organization for economic co operation and development oecd states that practical water policy instruments for local and national governments are needed to overcome barriers oecd 2011 policy instruments refer to the tools used by governments and public authorities to address related problems and achieve a public policy goal linder and peters 1989 in fact water policy instruments are tools strategies and mechanisms for policy makers to overcome governance obstacles in water policy for instance involving sub national governments in designing water policy beyond their roles as implementers is a policy instrument to foster effective water management oecd 2011 the main purpose of water policy instruments is to enhance water conservation and efficient use of water resources and a comprehensive evaluation of policy instruments is essential to achieve sustainable agricultural water management feike and henseler 2017 a lot can be said about different types of policy instruments in general their respective effectiveness and efficiency although they have to be adjusted to regional condition akhmouch 2012 akhmouch and correia 2016 araral and yu 2013 oecd 2015 rogers and hall 2003 since water governance is highly contextual water policy instruments have to be appropriate for different places oecd 2015 although there is literature related to water management in iran research which specifically addresses policy instruments for the improvement of the governance of ab bandans is not existent therefore this paper adds additional value to the scientific and empirical evidence by identifying relevant water policy instruments and assessing the suitability of these multiple instruments in an integrated way towards good governance of ab bandans in the mazandaran province of northern iran this paper aims 1 to identify policy instruments for the improvement of the governance of ab bandans 2 to cluster these instruments on three oecd reinforcing dimensions of water governance 3 to assess how and to what extent the instruments grouped in each dimension contribute to the improvement of the governance of ab bandans in this paper following the introduction section 2 details the theoretical background explaining the oecd dimensions and principles on water governance section 3 introduces the study area section 4 describes the sequential exploratory method for collecting and analyzing data section 5 presents findings and is followed by a discussion and conclusion of the research findings in sections 6 and 7 respectively 2 theoretical background water governance is a broader concept than water management moench et al 2003 it encompasses the political social economic and administrative systems involved in making decisions for management of water resources as well as water service delivery at different levels of society global water partnership 2003 rogers and hall 2003 16 noted that the governance for water is the ability to design public policies and institutional frameworks that are socially accepted and mobilize social resources in support of them oecd 2015a 5 defines water governance as the range of political institutional and administrative rules practices and processes formal and informal through which decisions are taken and implemented stakeholders can articulate their interests and have their concerns considered and decision makers are held accountable for water management as public authorities are in charge of water resources management in iran ardakanian 2005 it is crucial to understand their role with regard to the governance of ab bandans through the effective design and implementation of water policies this paper focuses on public authorities roles for water governance and their involvement in political institutional and administrative issues therefore it takes a close look at water policy instruments which can be applied by public authorities for solving challenges of the governance of ab bandans governance is considered as good governance when it is able to solve challenges for achieving results in a fair and comprehensive manner good governance in the water sector leads to sustainable water management for ensuring water security which is consistent with the goals legitimately established by a society akhmouch and correia 2016 oecd 2015a clarified water governance as good governance if a combination of bottom up and top down processes is applied to tackle water challenges and resolve conflictive issues related to water resources while fostering constructive state society relations good or effective governance systems provide processes and structures to facilitate actions for all actors involved in water management and do not create development obstacles rogers and hall 2003 good water governance cannot be achieved with the use of blueprints from outside of the given regions or countries and it has to be aligned with territorial specificities batchelor 2007 however oecd 2015a has formulated a menu of principles based on three mutually reinforcing and complementary dimensions of water governance the oecd principles consider different policy instruments which can be applied by governments at all levels to strengthen water governance to fit for current and future water challenges the principles were developed by the oecd water governance initiative a multi stakeholder platform of over 100 delegates from public private and non profit sectors to scale up governance responses to water challenges a preliminary step to developing the principles consisted in preparing an inventory of tools guidelines and principles on water governance to take stock of what already exists this document comprises 108 governance tools among which 55 are specific to the water sector these principles were grouped into three dimensions i e effectiveness efficiency trust and engagement and approved by the oecd regional development policy committee through a written procedure on 11 may 2015 each of the dimensions and related principles are explained as follows 1 the dimension of effectiveness refers to a clear definition of water related goals and targets at all government levels so that the goals are well implemented and the expected targets are obtained the dimension of effectiveness consists of the following four principles principle 1 clear allocation of roles and responsibilities across levels of government for policy making policy implementation operational management and regulation and enforcement at the same time fostering effective co ordination across levels of government principle 2 managing water at the appropriate scale s to reflect local conditions therefore ensuring an appropriate hydrological management and promoting strategies based on national policies and local conditions principle 3 encouraging policy coherence through effective cross sectoral co ordination mechanisms and recognition and mitigation of conflicts among authorities involved principle 4 promoting technical financial and institutional capacity through training water professionals and stakeholders and hiring public officials and professionals based on required competencies 1 the dimension of efficiency includes maximizing the benefits of water resource management with minimal costs for society the dimension of efficiency consists of the following four principles principle 5 producing updating and sharing water related data and information in a timely consistent and comparable manner to guide assess and improve water policy sharing information with stakeholders and encouraging their engagement in producing information is necessary in order to foster transparency trust and comparability principle 6 promoting governance arrangements that help water organizations across levels of government raise the necessary revenues to meet their mandates and allocate financial resources in an efficient transparent and timely manner principle 7 enforcing appropriate regulatory frameworks effectively so as to achieve water policy objectives and encourage long term planning principle 8 promoting innovative water governance practices across levels of government and stakeholders through pilot testing on water governance lessons from success and failures social learning and scientists involvement 1 the dimension of trust and engagement addresses building trust in public organizations and policy instruments and ensuring the involvement of all stakeholders through democracy and fairness for society the dimension of trust and engagement consists of the following four principles principle 9 promoting integrity and transparency practices across authorities involved to enable clear accountability and transparent decision making and implementation principle 10 promoting stakeholders engagement for designing and implementing water policies through identifying different stakeholders and their responsibilities and interactions paying attention to vulnerable groups e g women and youth and mitigating the power of over represented groups principle 11 ensuring equity across water stakeholders rural and urban areas and generations through non discriminatory participation empowering local officials and water stakeholders promoting public discussions to raise awareness and assessing the consequences of water policies on citizens stakeholders and different areas principle 12 promoting regular monitoring and evaluation of water policies through dedicated and independent institutions for monitoring and evaluation developing reliable mechanisms for reports assessing achievement of intended targets and sharing results with the public in a timely and transparent manner in order to have an effective and long term water management a combination of principles should be used for designing water policies oecd 2011 an overview of the three mutually reinforcing oecd dimensions of water governance is illustrated in fig 1 3 study area geography and ab bandans characteristics the mazandaran province is located in northern iran along the southern coast of the caspian sea 53 6 e 36 23 n with an area of 24 000 km2 1 46 of the total area of iran kheyroddin and hedayatifard 2017 fig 2 the climate of the area is divided into two types 1 moderate caspian weather with hot and humid summers mild and humid winters 2 cold mountainous weather with long freezing winters and short cool summers especially in the mountains khoshbakht and hammer 2006 it has a high production capacity of agriculture due to humid temperate climate and suitable soil khoshbakht and hammer 2006 mazandaran plays an important role in food security in iran because it ranks first with 41 73 of rice production as a staple food ministry of agriculture iran 2015 there are 880 ab bandans in mazandaran with an area of around 17 000 ha depths varying from 1 5 m to 4 m and sizes ranging from 3 ha to 1000 ha mazandaran regional water authority 2016 it is assumed that ab bandans are about 3000 years old rahimi farahani et al 2012 they are traditional water harvesting systems ghoddousi 1999 which are constructed by digging the land and compacting the soil to construct a wall around the excavated pond ejlali et al 2012 water per hectare of ab bandans can supply water requirements for 6 ha of rice fields in this area mazandaran regional water authority 2016 in addition to storing water for rice cultivation ab bandans can play a significant role in recharging underground water and wells collecting drainage water aquaculture habitat for birds and plants attracting tourism creating jobs and preventing the migration of rural people to the cities salabi 2010 4 material and methods an exploratory sequential design was followed as a mixed methods approach for the purpose of research mixed methods research involves both quantitative and qualitative research for a deeper understanding of a phenomenon johnson et al 2007 specifically we employed an instrument development variant of the exploratory sequential design in which researchers first gather the qualitative data in order to explore the research topic with a few participants and then the qualitative data is used to develop a quantitative instrument for a large sample creswell and plano clark 2007 fig 3 this design is suitable when researchers want to build and test an instrument to identify unknown variables to study a phenomenon in more depth and also to generalize results to a large group creswell and plano clark 2007 in the qualitative phase we used semi structured face to face interviews to collect qualitative data interviews were conducted with experts who are working in public administration and in private companies pertaining to water management at the regional level we initially applied purposive sampling and started with eight interviewees who were known to the researchers then we asked them for other possible interview partners finally 30 people were asked to answer the main question about different instruments and strategies required for improving the governance of ab bandans and overcoming related barriers interviewees from the public sector 19 interviewees included individuals from the agriculture organization the forest range and watershed management organization the regional water authority the department of environment and the fisheries organization interviewees from the private companies 11 interviewees were technical engineers who are involved in the design and implementation of rehabilitation projects for ab bandans investigating the views of people in the wide range of public and private entities involved in water management at the regional level increased the credibility of the research shenton 2004 we conducted the interviews in dialogue form using tailored questions based on the oecd principles all the interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim we reviewed the transcripts to extract policy instruments for the improvement of the governance of ab bandans and we identified 31 different policy instruments ultimately the instruments identified were clustered and grouped according to the oecd dimensions fig 1 the results from the qualitative phase were applied to build a questionnaire for the quantitative phase in a way that each of the three dimensions included 9 12 10 items i e policy instruments respectively with a numerical 10 point scale see table 1 the use of numerical scale helps to discover the presence of measurement continuum and to avoid the semantic interpretation a typical problem related to verbal scales schifini et al 2004 2 andrews 1984 showed that increasing the number of scale categories improve data quality due to making better validity and reducing residual errors in order to maximize the content validity of the questionnaire we selected 4 of the interviewees as a panel of judges and asked them to revise the relevance of items to the constructs being measured and the clarity and conciseness of the items the final decision whether to accept or reject the recommendations was the responsibility of the researchers as the scale developers devellis 2003 based on the result of cronbach s alpha using spss software 0 76 for effectiveness 0 79 for efficiency 0 86 for trust and engagement we decided to retain all the items in the questionnaire afterwards we distributed the questionnaires to a large sample of participants through snowball sampling and asked them to rate the importance of each policy instrument to improve the governance of ab bandans from 1 to 10 a score of 1 refers to no importance and a score of 10 to high importance of the instruments finally 169 questionnaires n 169 were collected and analyzed fig 4 a confirmatory factor analysis cfa was conducted using lisrel software to analyze the quantitative data the cfa helped to assess how and to what extent the policy instruments identified i e observed variables can logically and systematically represent three reinforcing dimensions of the governance of ab bandans i e latent variables constructs the cfa is a type of structural equation modeling sem to test the relationships between observed variables a variable that can be directly measured and latent variables a variable that is a theoretical concept and cannot be observed directly brown 2006 in the cfa researchers postulate relations between the observed variables and the underlying latent variables a priori and then test this hypothesized model statistically byrne 2010 in this paper we assumed the hypothesized model as positive relations between the policy instruments identified and their related dimensions 5 findings table 1 presents the policy instruments mentioned by the 30 interviewees in the qualitative phase as well as the classification of these instruments on three oecd reinforcing dimensions effectiveness efficiency trust and engagement of water governance afterwards the cfa was performed to evaluate the goodness of fit of the hypothesized model a number of requirements for conducting the cfa were checked first of all the linear interpolation method was used for replacing missing values runkler 2016 the result revealed that there were no systematic missing values furthermore data screening showed that the observed variable of a3 should be removed from the data due to a number of extreme values then the normality assumption was tested and the result indicated that the data were not normally distributed this fact led to the adoption of the unweighted least squares uls estimation method which does not depend on a normality distribution assumption schumacker and lomax 2016 to assess the fitness of the hypothesized model various indices were calculated table 2 it was found that the hypothesized model revealed a poor fit to the data in some indices x2 df 3 826 rmsea 0 130 therefore modification indices were applied by freeing error covariance between a1 and a2 b7 and b8 c6 and c7 and c7 and c8 respectively additionally b3 and b4 with a factor loading of less than 0 30 were excluded from the hypothesized model brown 2006 tabachnick and fidell 2013 after modifications as the goodness of fit indices indicate in table 2 an acceptable fit to the data was achieved as a result all 28 remaining observed variables within the modified model properly represent three latent variables table 2 provides an overview of criteria for goodness of fit indices of the modified model convergent validity was assessed in order to examine construct validity the convergent validity is the correlation between two or more measures of a specific construct westen and rosenthal 2003 hair et al 2010 and it is assessed based on the standardized factor loading λ average variance extracted ave and composite reliability cr the factor loadings values should be equal or greater than 0 3 brown 2006 tabachnick and fidell 2013 and the acceptable values of the ave and cr were considered to be 0 5 and 0 7 respectively hair et al 2010 the results confirmed that all factor loadings are greater than 0 3 and the values of cr range from 0 808 to 0 866 indicating the adequate internal consistency of the constructs the ave was below the adequate value nevertheless fornell and larcker 1981 noted that if ave is less than 0 50 the variance due to measurement error is larger than the variance captured by the construct however based on the composite reliability alone researchers may conclude that the convergent validity of the construct is adequate even though more than 50 of the variance is due to the measurement error therefore as shown in table 3 the modified model had good convergent validity the results of the correlation matrix phi i e intercorrelations among all latent variables indicated that the constructs of efed efid and ted were positively related to one another fig 5 this means that changes in one observed variable of a given construct are associated with proportional changes in the other constructs hair et al 2010 the results also showed that the t values of all paths between observed variables and their underlying constructs were statistically significant table 3 fig 5 therefore these observed variables play a significant role in representing the three constructs moreover observed variables with higher factor loadings are representative of the construct hair et al 2010 table 3 in other words factor loadings indicate the correlation of each observed variable and the construct and they give us an idea about how much the variable has contributed to the construct yong and pearce 2013 hence those observed variables i e policy instruments which are highly related to their constructs play more roles in representing the construct and are more contributed to their construct based on the larger factor loadings the following policy instruments are more contributed to the improvement of the governance of ab bandans policy instruments in the improvement of effectiveness dimension a7 λ 0 679 training farmers regarding conservation

bandans were identified and grouped into three oecd dimensions based on the cfa the modified model which consisted of 28 policy instruments properly represents three reinforcing dimensions the following subsections include a discussion of the policy instruments which are more contributed to the improvement of the governance of ab bandans 6 1 improvement of effectiveness dimension 6 1 1 training farmers regarding conservation and optimal use of water interviewees believed that it is not possible to improve knowledge and perception of farmers regarding optimal use of water without adequate training and raised awareness for instance farmers have to be aware that storing water above the maximum storage level and keeping a reservoir full can destroy the reservoirs due to the generation of high waves thus training and building the capacity of farmers as end users for the protection of ab bandans is necessary it is imperative to note that the training approach should be based on a participatory learning process and knowledge sharing among farmers this is a totally different approach from simply delivering knowledge and it aims to strengthen the problem solving skills of farmers by fostering participation self confidence dialogue joint decision making and self determination röling and van de fliert 1994 this training approach increases farmers knowledge and empowers them to change their perspectives and behavior in order to be active in altering the current condition to a desired one hjorth 2003 interviewees added that training is not limited to farmers but water professionals and public officials have to be aware of the economic environmental and social values of ab bandans the importance of local stakeholders participation optimal utilization and management of water and related engineering and technical issues since the capacity of an organization strongly depends on the capabilities of its personnel training approach for professionals is a crucial policy for capacity building across the full range of water organizations it could be performed through specially designed courses modification of university courses in service modules seminars and workshops global water partnership 2017 6 1 2 reconstruction and modernization of ab bandans based on the interviewees opinion the infrastructure of a bandans has to be improved using advanced technology for instance installing modern gates and digital meters can control the volume of water entering and leaving the reservoirs and prevent water wastage when this has been done ab bandans as traditional water harvesting systems which are consistent with indigenous knowledge and culture can be integrated with modern irrigation networks i e dams and their interaction with dams in irrigation system could be determined the interviewees added that farmers should know the purpose and benefits of adopting water technology as well as the usage so that they are willing to participate in the adoption and maintenance of a given technology in this way ab bandans will be considered as small dams within rural communities which not only improve the economic conditions but also strengthen social cohesion and motivation to remain in the village as evans and sadler 2008 mentioned technology oriented policies e g advanced irrigation systems are appropriate tools for a more water efficient management as this protects and uses less water which in turn increases crop productivity and ultimately achieves an economic advantage for farmers akhmouch 2012 stated that new technologies and innovative water processes are effective for approaching cost effective objectives and water security which require the transfer of know how at the regional and local level especially when service delivery is not managed by the private sector levidow et al 2014 also concluded that proper use of technology is more important than technological investment which depends on applied research demonstration activities outreach farmers training and skills development 6 1 3 promoting meritocracy in administrative procedures to carry out duties interviewees stated that employing professionals in the water related public administration should be based on capabilities and competencies regardless of political orientation water professionals could carry out their tasks properly and play an effective role in the success of water organizations if they possess the necessary knowledge and skill in their job furthermore interviewees mentioned that top managers should regard thoughtful and knowledgeable professionals as an opportunity for water organizations and provide an atmosphere which aims at the acquisition of creative ideas meritocracy is one of the most basic aspects of organizational culture which emphasizes the link between individual merit and career without being biased against gender race class or any other non merit factors castilla and benard 2010 oecd 2015a highlighted that the most vital resource of each organization is its employees therefore employing public officials and professionals in the water sector should be merit oriented transparent and independent of political cycles 6 1 4 training farmers for acceptance of new projects regarding multiple functions of ab bandans according to the interviewees farmers should be involved in the process of studying designing and implementing new projects regarding multiple functions of ab bandans and they should be trained with regard to the importance and benefits of these projects during the process otherwise not only the project objectives cannot be achieved but these projects could also lead to conflicts and confrontation among different groups of beneficiaries and distrust of the government it must be kept in mind that the goals of rural development projects are not merely reaching economic benefits but also creating social products e g upgraded local leadership a culture of enterprise and innovative action increased engagement capacity among people to overcome problems and effective use of opportunities therefore the provision of educational policies for adoption of development programs seems to be necessary lowe et al 1999 oecd noya and clarence 2009 also reported that all members of the community should be empowered to cooperate in rural development through the enhancement of knowledge skills and competencies 6 2 improvement of efficiency dimension 6 2 1 long term and comprehensive plans for water resource management at the national and regional levels interviewees believed that a comprehensive and long term national plan for the sustainable conservation of water resources in consistence with the ecological economic and social features should be addressed moreover regional water management with respect to the role of ab bandans and the sustainable use of their various potentials should also be included in this national planning ardakanian 2005 believed that long term policies and strategies are required for water resource management in iran and establishing a comprehensive national water management system based on all elements of water cycle should be considered in water management policies in addition this system needs to be strongly linked to a national spatial strategy plan based on the natural water basins of the country ardakanian 2005 because water management and spatial planning are directly related to each other woltjer and al 2007 in other words regional plans for development exploitation and conservation of water resources have to be designed under the umbrella of national and comprehensive watershed based plans ardakanian 2005 6 2 2 using social media to create social network for water conservation social media can be useful as a tool for turning water threats into a social and inclusive concern as well as creating a public space to discuss them statement of one interviewee this is due to the fact that the application of social media as one of the most innovative means of information and communication technology has been widely welcomed recently boon and sinclair 2009 it allows certain slogans contents and ideas to spread rapidly as the main social media feature is its viral nature nalewajek and mącik 2013 in this way public officials can convey their messages to people and unite them for a common purpose terracina hartman et al 2013 the study of roshandel arbatani et al 2016 on zayandeh rood river in iran showed that social media strongly influenced the environmental behavior of citizens and improved their knowledge attitudes emotions and behaviors regarding environmental protection moreover social media led citizens to consider environmental hazards which were of no concern to them before membership in the virtual environmental groups and to participate financially in environmental protection in addition it provides a facility in which citizens are able to criticize the government s environmental policies 6 2 3 conducting experimentation and pilot projects on various potentials of ab bandans a simultaneous use of various functions of ab bandans should be tested in a number of cases and its social economic and environmental consequences should be carefully investigated interviewees believed that in advance of a wider introduction visiting pilot projects by farmers is an effective way of building trust in the government and increasing participation and awareness among farmers on the integrated use of potentials as political tools the pilots provide a good opportunity for policies and strategies to be tested before extensive implementation but also generate knowledge that can be transferred to the community vreugdenhil and slinger 2008 vreugdenhil et al 2010 the pilot projects are widely used to introduce government policies and plans nair and howlett 2015 and managers in the water sector regularly apply pilots as instruments for testing innovations and implementing policies on a small scale vreugdenhil et al 2010 according to the interviewees after ensuring that the pilots can be implemented on a large scale it is possible to continue by providing local people with loans at low cost interest rates in order to create jobs based on the potentials of ab bandans in the form of groups and associations and consequently improving income and livelihood in the communities ab bandans can be used as an income source for rural households in different ways e g a place for spending leisure and recreation time attracting tourists through building floating restaurants organizing fishing and boating tournaments etc creating sustainable jobs based on the potentials of ab bandans not only enhances a sense of ownership and participation in exploitation and maintenance processes but also contributes to the rural development and so prevents the migration of rural people especially new generations to the cities 6 2 4 encouraging local water market by public authorities a number of interviewees pointed out that recently farmers who are users of ab bandans sell water to other farmers within the village through the informal market when ab bandans have more water than they require this type of water market includes an informal agreement between neighboring farmers about how to share supplied or extracted water for mutual benefit based on the local agreement one farmer who allows access to his water to another farmer receives economic benefits nikolakis et al 2013 however faruqui 2001 emphasized that governments must undertake studies for water markets and make necessary legal institutional and economic reforms through involving multi stakeholders moreover nikolakis et al 2013 added that market based approaches in natural resource governance only have social legitimacy if they are consistent with the values of local stakeholders in addition a slow evolution of farmers mentality is required go mez limo n and martı nez 2006 334 6 3 improvement of trust and engagement dimension 6 3 1 enhancing participation and teamwork among farmers through improving their attitude this instrument plays more roles in the governance of ab bandans not only in the trust and engagement dimension but also in all dimensions according to one interviewee participation of farmers has to be the result of their intellectual development and internal desire and motivation encouraging farmers participation requires the promotion of their attitude towards collective preferences rather than individual and short term benefits if farmers have a positive attitude towards collective action they can see that participation in water related processes is beneficial both for themselves and for their society otherwise it is impossible to force them to actively engage the development of their attitude and willingness is an effective component for enhancing participation among farmers according to dungumaro and madulu 2003 fostering the sense of cooperation and participation in local communities through their involvement in the assessment and solving of water problems can also be effective for resolving conflicts this in turn can build trust between local stakeholders and water organizations which would lead to a sense of ownership and responsibility among local communities dungumaro and madulu 2003 interviewees highlighted the fact that public officials should also have a positive attitude towards the participation of farmers in the management of ab bandans it is important to understand that design and management of development projects outside rural areas which are then introduced into rural communities for implementation cannot be successful thus the attitude of the government that they know everything while rural people are inexperienced and not knowledgeable should move towards bottom up development and putting people first oakley 1991 based on interviews conducted it was revealed that the government should undertake the role of a facilitator in the management of ab bandans rather than administrator and executor and should conduct participatory management for ab bandans interviewees emphasized that the management of ab bandans should be given to farmers in the form of water user associations wanga et al 2006 believed that farmers are the key decision makers and should decide on their roles as well as the activities and roles which they want their managers and leaders to perform indeed farmers are able to participate in a collective manner in all aspects of water management including physical financial decision making evaluation and monitoring aspects wanga et al 2006 6 3 2 developing trust in public officials through addressing farmers and their needs in water related decisions and planning collective attitudes and participatory behavior of farmers are essential for water management but trust in the government is also important for successful participatory governance because if farmers do not trust government officials the likelihood of their participation is reduced lubell 2004 according to one interviewee building trust in the government can lead to the participation of farmers in the adoption of new projects regarding the various potentials of ab bandans in fact farmers should feel that meeting their needs is the main concern of the government in the management of ab bandans so that they can trust the government and show participatory and peaceful behavior most water conflicts in the agricultural sector in iran are between government as an administrator of water management and farmers as users bijani and hayati 2011 therefore building public trust in the government through democratic legitimacy and fairness plays a vital role as a principle in water governance oecd 2015 6 3 3 mitigating conflicts among local stakeholders one interviewee cited that farmers have to reach social maturity and social acceptance of each other it appears that the achievement of an agreement among local stakeholders and the admittance of each other are crucial in order to solve barriers and create a participatory approach to the governance of ab bandans according to the interviewees water policy should be based on conflicts resolution among local stakeholders using mechanisms such as strengthening rural dispute resolution councils promoting a culture of dialogue and unbiased government intervention swatuk et al 2008 said that promoting effective communication and collaboration in spite of diverse interests identifying the causes of conflicts building trust and planning in a participatory manner should be considered in the management of conflicts this should include the employment of various methods e g negotiation mediation conciliation and consensus building swatuk et al 2008 bijani and hayati 2011 argued that change from governmentality to governance is the best way to reduce and eliminate water conflicts in iran which need cultural enhancement public participation government support without being authoritative and training of local stakeholders it should be considered that water conflicts cannot be solved simply through a series of fixed and written laws but people and their participation should be implemented for overcoming contradictions in this way in addition to conflicts management social capital in rural communities is improved and local traditions and social institutions are regenerated bijani and hayati 2011 6 3 4 ensuring the transparency of public officials performance in the water sector through mass media interviewees stated that there should be some conditions in the water sector where criticism and comments about the performance of responsible authorities does not lead to punishment or retaliation but is rather seen as an opportunity to correct mistakes they emphasized that freedom of speech with regard to criticism and assessment of the performance of public authorities and their policies in mass media plays a crucial role in the promotion of accountability and transparency dunu 2013 noted that institutions and governments should be accountable and transparent for their policies and performance because according to ashraf 2014 people must know what their governments are doing consequently policy failures maladministration corruption and scandals in public administration and their related entities can be highlighted through mass media in order to promote responsiveness and transparency among all citizens ashraf 2014 the fact is that all aspects of good governance including accountability transparency participation rule of law efficiency effectiveness etc are facilitated by using a strong pluralistic and independent media within the society dunu 2013 7 conclusion the result showed that 28 out of 31 policy instruments identified properly contribute to the improvement of the governance of ab bandans however the enhancement of participation and collective action among farmers due to the highest factor loading among all the instruments in three dimensions is more contributed to the improvement of water governance therefore it can be seen as the starting point for the desired transformation even if participation cannot be seen as the new orthodoxy it is clear that participation has become one of the central influences in mainstream development thinking parfitt 2004 537 consequently farmers willingness to participate in management processes and their collective action can be seen as a panacea for enhancing the governance of ab bandans to this end the top down paradigm of government should be changed into a bottom up paradigm and participatory governance and the government should undertake the role of a facilitator rather than governmentality in the governance of ab bandans moreover the significant issue is that each dimension in the improvement of the governance of ab bandans interacts with the other dimensions therefore the policy instruments are interdependent and shouldn t be addressed in isolation the improvement of the governance of ab bandans should be systematic and it is not possible to apply a single policy instrument without considering the impact of other policy instruments it is necessary to adopt the policy instruments in a holistic way to solve difficulties in the governance of ab bandans this study has some limitations including the sample size in the quantitative phase furthermore water governance is strongly dependent on context ab bandans are just restricted to northern iran so these policy instruments cannot be generalized in respect of other areas in iran nevertheless these instruments can be used as a basis for other case studies in the country with reference to rivers lakes underground waters although the results of this study are a good starting point for creating a positive change in the governance of ab bandans further research could be conducted to assess the ex ante or ex post effect of each policy instrument in the improvement of the governance of ab bandans it calls for further data and analysis in which the viewpoints of farmers can be covered acknowledgments this paper is part of a ph d study which was conducted by the first author at the university of hohenheim germany it is an output of a scholarship from the food security center at hohenheim university which is part of the daad german academic exchange service program exceed and is supported by daad and the german federal ministry for economic co operation and development bmz this publication has been also financially supported by the fiat panis ph d grant from the foundation fiat panis we would like to thank all participants who

11283,man made water reservoirs called ab bandan in mazandaran province northern iran are used to collect precipitation for irrigating rice fields in spite of their importance ab bandans face governance difficulties such as the lack of a specific law the lack of long term and strategic planning and low recognition of these reservoirs at the national level therefore water policy instruments are argued to be needed in order to overcome the barriers and improve water governance this paper aims to identify and assess relevant policy instruments for the improvement of the governance of ab bandans by conducting an exploratory sequential research design based on interviews with 30 regional experts 31 policy instruments are identified and grouped into three reinforcing dimensions of water governance effectiveness efficiency and trust and engagement afterwards these policy instruments are assessed by a larger sample of participants through snowball sampling n 169 confirmatory factor analysis reveals that in survey participants opinion 28 out of 31 policy instruments identified properly represent three reinforcing dimensions of water governance the results indicate that the enhancement of collective action among farmers is the policy instrument which contributes more to the improvement of governance furthermore the dimensions are positively related to one another therefore the policy instruments are interdependent and should be addressed in a holistic way keywords water policy good governance confirmatory factor analysis ab bandan mazandaran 1 introduction water is the main component required for most activities in human society all societies need water for basic survival and economic development chenoweth 2008 thus the water crisis is one of the key problems of global relevance in the 21 st century orr et al 2009 the water crisis is not due to water shortage because sufficient water exists for all people even in areas where there is a temporary shortage of water but a crisis of governance e g fragmented institutional structures and weak regulatory framework result in or exacerbate problems of water availability oecd 2011 scholars in the water sector highlighted the fact that enhancing water governance is the solution to the water crisis akhmouch 2012 araral and yu 2013 biswas and tortajada 2010 oecd 2015 rogers and hall 2003 saleth and dinar 2005 the government of iran blames the current water crisis on the changing climate frequent droughts and international sanctions in order to hide the inefficient water management system in the country madani 2014 many iranian experts claim that a failure of water governance is the more significant cause of water crisis foltz 2002 madani 2014 pointed out that the water crisis in iran is rooted in managerial political and institutional determinants rather than engineering and technical issues although the climate has varied over the centuries iran has always been located in an arid and semi arid region therefore it should not be assumed as is often the case that water is scarce in iran yazdanpanah et al 2013 the average annual precipitation of the country is approximately 417 billion cubic meters bcm of which 117 bcm of the precipitation is directly accessible of which 92 bcm flows as surface water resources and 25 bcm infiltrates into groundwater resources ardakanian 2005 in contrast to most provinces the mazandaran province located in northern iran which is the most important region for rice production in the country has a high annual average precipitation of 749 9 mm ministry of agriculture iran 2015 ministry of energy iran 2015 a considerable amount of the precipitation in mazandaran occurs during the non growing seasons autumn and winter azmoodeh et al 2009 in order to collect this precipitation to be used for irrigating rice fields during the growing seasons spring and summer there are man made reservoirs called ab bandan abbasian et al 2014 in spite of these reservoirs a significant amount of precipitation runs off into the sea through rivers without being stored azmoodeh et al 2009 sometimes even causing water logging or flooding ministry of agriculture iran 2016 this province has a potential of 4 9 billion m3 as surface water resources and of which around 2 2 billion m3 is being stored and the remaining water flows into the sea ejlali et al 2016 according to a number of regional experts ab bandans are not well governed due to the lack of a specific law the lack of long term and strategic planning of administrative bodies low recognition of ab bandans at the national level financial problems for rehabilitation of ab bandans lack of water user associations little relevance of academic research on ab bandans to practice and poor use of water technology mirzaei et al 2017 the organization for economic co operation and development oecd states that practical water policy instruments for local and national governments are needed to overcome barriers oecd 2011 policy instruments refer to the tools used by governments and public authorities to address related problems and achieve a public policy goal linder and peters 1989 in fact water policy instruments are tools strategies and mechanisms for policy makers to overcome governance obstacles in water policy for instance involving sub national governments in designing water policy beyond their roles as implementers is a policy instrument to foster effective water management oecd 2011 the main purpose of water policy instruments is to enhance water conservation and efficient use of water resources and a comprehensive evaluation of policy instruments is essential to achieve sustainable agricultural water management feike and henseler 2017 a lot can be said about different types of policy instruments in general their respective effectiveness and efficiency although they have to be adjusted to regional condition akhmouch 2012 akhmouch and correia 2016 araral and yu 2013 oecd 2015 rogers and hall 2003 since water governance is highly contextual water policy instruments have to be appropriate for different places oecd 2015 although there is literature related to water management in iran research which specifically addresses policy instruments for the improvement of the governance of ab bandans is not existent therefore this paper adds additional value to the scientific and empirical evidence by identifying relevant water policy instruments and assessing the suitability of these multiple instruments in an integrated way towards good governance of ab bandans in the mazandaran province of northern iran this paper aims 1 to identify policy instruments for the improvement of the governance of ab bandans 2 to cluster these instruments on three oecd reinforcing dimensions of water governance 3 to assess how and to what extent the instruments grouped in each dimension contribute to the improvement of the governance of ab bandans in this paper following the introduction section 2 details the theoretical background explaining the oecd dimensions and principles on water governance section 3 introduces the study area section 4 describes the sequential exploratory method for collecting and analyzing data section 5 presents findings and is followed by a discussion and conclusion of the research findings in sections 6 and 7 respectively 2 theoretical background water governance is a broader concept than water management moench et al 2003 it encompasses the political social economic and administrative systems involved in making decisions for management of water resources as well as water service delivery at different levels of society global water partnership 2003 rogers and hall 2003 16 noted that the governance for water is the ability to design public policies and institutional frameworks that are socially accepted and mobilize social resources in support of them oecd 2015a 5 defines water governance as the range of political institutional and administrative rules practices and processes formal and informal through which decisions are taken and implemented stakeholders can articulate their interests and have their concerns considered and decision makers are held accountable for water management as public authorities are in charge of water resources management in iran ardakanian 2005 it is crucial to understand their role with regard to the governance of ab bandans through the effective design and implementation of water policies this paper focuses on public authorities roles for water governance and their involvement in political institutional and administrative issues therefore it takes a close look at water policy instruments which can be applied by public authorities for solving challenges of the governance of ab bandans governance is considered as good governance when it is able to solve challenges for achieving results in a fair and comprehensive manner good governance in the water sector leads to sustainable water management for ensuring water security which is consistent with the goals legitimately established by a society akhmouch and correia 2016 oecd 2015a clarified water governance as good governance if a combination of bottom up and top down processes is applied to tackle water challenges and resolve conflictive issues related to water resources while fostering constructive state society relations good or effective governance systems provide processes and structures to facilitate actions for all actors involved in water management and do not create development obstacles rogers and hall 2003 good water governance cannot be achieved with the use of blueprints from outside of the given regions or countries and it has to be aligned with territorial specificities batchelor 2007 however oecd 2015a has formulated a menu of principles based on three mutually reinforcing and complementary dimensions of water governance the oecd principles consider different policy instruments which can be applied by governments at all levels to strengthen water governance to fit for current and future water challenges the principles were developed by the oecd water governance initiative a multi stakeholder platform of over 100 delegates from public private and non profit sectors to scale up governance responses to water challenges a preliminary step to developing the principles consisted in preparing an inventory of tools guidelines and principles on water governance to take stock of what already exists this document comprises 108 governance tools among which 55 are specific to the water sector these principles were grouped into three dimensions i e effectiveness efficiency trust and engagement and approved by the oecd regional development policy committee through a written procedure on 11 may 2015 each of the dimensions and related principles are explained as follows 1 the dimension of effectiveness refers to a clear definition of water related goals and targets at all government levels so that the goals are well implemented and the expected targets are obtained the dimension of effectiveness consists of the following four principles principle 1 clear allocation of roles and responsibilities across levels of government for policy making policy implementation operational management and regulation and enforcement at the same time fostering effective co ordination across levels of government principle 2 managing water at the appropriate scale s to reflect local conditions therefore ensuring an appropriate hydrological management and promoting strategies based on national policies and local conditions principle 3 encouraging policy coherence through effective cross sectoral co ordination mechanisms and recognition and mitigation of conflicts among authorities involved principle 4 promoting technical financial and institutional capacity through training water professionals and stakeholders and hiring public officials and professionals based on required competencies 1 the dimension of efficiency includes maximizing the benefits of water resource management with minimal costs for society the dimension of efficiency consists of the following four principles principle 5 producing updating and sharing water related data and information in a timely consistent and comparable manner to guide assess and improve water policy sharing information with stakeholders and encouraging their engagement in producing information is necessary in order to foster transparency trust and comparability principle 6 promoting governance arrangements that help water organizations across levels of government raise the necessary revenues to meet their mandates and allocate financial resources in an efficient transparent and timely manner principle 7 enforcing appropriate regulatory frameworks effectively so as to achieve water policy objectives and encourage long term planning principle 8 promoting innovative water governance practices across levels of government and stakeholders through pilot testing on water governance lessons from success and failures social learning and scientists involvement 1 the dimension of trust and engagement addresses building trust in public organizations and policy instruments and ensuring the involvement of all stakeholders through democracy and fairness for society the dimension of trust and engagement consists of the following four principles principle 9 promoting integrity and transparency practices across authorities involved to enable clear accountability and transparent decision making and implementation principle 10 promoting stakeholders engagement for designing and implementing water policies through identifying different stakeholders and their responsibilities and interactions paying attention to vulnerable groups e g women and youth and mitigating the power of over represented groups principle 11 ensuring equity across water stakeholders rural and urban areas and generations through non discriminatory participation empowering local officials and water stakeholders promoting public discussions to raise awareness and assessing the consequences of water policies on citizens stakeholders and different areas principle 12 promoting regular monitoring and evaluation of water policies through dedicated and independent institutions for monitoring and evaluation developing reliable mechanisms for reports assessing achievement of intended targets and sharing results with the public in a timely and transparent manner in order to have an effective and long term water management a combination of principles should be used for designing water policies oecd 2011 an overview of the three mutually reinforcing oecd dimensions of water governance is illustrated in fig 1 3 study area geography and ab bandans characteristics the mazandaran province is located in northern iran along the southern coast of the caspian sea 53 6 e 36 23 n with an area of 24 000 km2 1 46 of the total area of iran kheyroddin and hedayatifard 2017 fig 2 the climate of the area is divided into two types 1 moderate caspian weather with hot and humid summers mild and humid winters 2 cold mountainous weather with long freezing winters and short cool summers especially in the mountains khoshbakht and hammer 2006 it has a high production capacity of agriculture due to humid temperate climate and suitable soil khoshbakht and hammer 2006 mazandaran plays an important role in food security in iran because it ranks first with 41 73 of rice production as a staple food ministry of agriculture iran 2015 there are 880 ab bandans in mazandaran with an area of around 17 000 ha depths varying from 1 5 m to 4 m and sizes ranging from 3 ha to 1000 ha mazandaran regional water authority 2016 it is assumed that ab bandans are about 3000 years old rahimi farahani et al 2012 they are traditional water harvesting systems ghoddousi 1999 which are constructed by digging the land and compacting the soil to construct a wall around the excavated pond ejlali et al 2012 water per hectare of ab bandans can supply water requirements for 6 ha of rice fields in this area mazandaran regional water authority 2016 in addition to storing water for rice cultivation ab bandans can play a significant role in recharging underground water and wells collecting drainage water aquaculture habitat for birds and plants attracting tourism creating jobs and preventing the migration of rural people to the cities salabi 2010 4 material and methods an exploratory sequential design was followed as a mixed methods approach for the purpose of research mixed methods research involves both quantitative and qualitative research for a deeper understanding of a phenomenon johnson et al 2007 specifically we employed an instrument development variant of the exploratory sequential design in which researchers first gather the qualitative data in order to explore the research topic with a few participants and then the qualitative data is used to develop a quantitative instrument for a large sample creswell and plano clark 2007 fig 3 this design is suitable when researchers want to build and test an instrument to identify unknown variables to study a phenomenon in more depth and also to generalize results to a large group creswell and plano clark 2007 in the qualitative phase we used semi structured face to face interviews to collect qualitative data interviews were conducted with experts who are working in public administration and in private companies pertaining to water management at the regional level we initially applied purposive sampling and started with eight interviewees who were known to the researchers then we asked them for other possible interview partners finally 30 people were asked to answer the main question about different instruments and strategies required for improving the governance of ab bandans and overcoming related barriers interviewees from the public sector 19 interviewees included individuals from the agriculture organization the forest range and watershed management organization the regional water authority the department of environment and the fisheries organization interviewees from the private companies 11 interviewees were technical engineers who are involved in the design and implementation of rehabilitation projects for ab bandans investigating the views of people in the wide range of public and private entities involved in water management at the regional level increased the credibility of the research shenton 2004 we conducted the interviews in dialogue form using tailored questions based on the oecd principles all the interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim we reviewed the transcripts to extract policy instruments for the improvement of the governance of ab bandans and we identified 31 different policy instruments ultimately the instruments identified were clustered and grouped according to the oecd dimensions fig 1 the results from the qualitative phase were applied to build a questionnaire for the quantitative phase in a way that each of the three dimensions included 9 12 10 items i e policy instruments respectively with a numerical 10 point scale see table 1 the use of numerical scale helps to discover the presence of measurement continuum and to avoid the semantic interpretation a typical problem related to verbal scales schifini et al 2004 2 andrews 1984 showed that increasing the number of scale categories improve data quality due to making better validity and reducing residual errors in order to maximize the content validity of the questionnaire we selected 4 of the interviewees as a panel of judges and asked them to revise the relevance of items to the constructs being measured and the clarity and conciseness of the items the final decision whether to accept or reject the recommendations was the responsibility of the researchers as the scale developers devellis 2003 based on the result of cronbach s alpha using spss software 0 76 for effectiveness 0 79 for efficiency 0 86 for trust and engagement we decided to retain all the items in the questionnaire afterwards we distributed the questionnaires to a large sample of participants through snowball sampling and asked them to rate the importance of each policy instrument to improve the governance of ab bandans from 1 to 10 a score of 1 refers to no importance and a score of 10 to high importance of the instruments finally 169 questionnaires n 169 were collected and analyzed fig 4 a confirmatory factor analysis cfa was conducted using lisrel software to analyze the quantitative data the cfa helped to assess how and to what extent the policy instruments identified i e observed variables can logically and systematically represent three reinforcing dimensions of the governance of ab bandans i e latent variables constructs the cfa is a type of structural equation modeling sem to test the relationships between observed variables a variable that can be directly measured and latent variables a variable that is a theoretical concept and cannot be observed directly brown 2006 in the cfa researchers postulate relations between the observed variables and the underlying latent variables a priori and then test this hypothesized model statistically byrne 2010 in this paper we assumed the hypothesized model as positive relations between the policy instruments identified and their related dimensions 5 findings table 1 presents the policy instruments mentioned by the 30 interviewees in the qualitative phase as well as the classification of these instruments on three oecd reinforcing dimensions effectiveness efficiency trust and engagement of water governance afterwards the cfa was performed to evaluate the goodness of fit of the hypothesized model a number of requirements for conducting the cfa were checked first of all the linear interpolation method was used for replacing missing values runkler 2016 the result revealed that there were no systematic missing values furthermore data screening showed that the observed variable of a3 should be removed from the data due to a number of extreme values then the normality assumption was tested and the result indicated that the data were not normally distributed this fact led to the adoption of the unweighted least squares uls estimation method which does not depend on a normality distribution assumption schumacker and lomax 2016 to assess the fitness of the hypothesized model various indices were calculated table 2 it was found that the hypothesized model revealed a poor fit to the data in some indices x2 df 3 826 rmsea 0 130 therefore modification indices were applied by freeing error covariance between a1 and a2 b7 and b8 c6 and c7 and c7 and c8 respectively additionally b3 and b4 with a factor loading of less than 0 30 were excluded from the hypothesized model brown 2006 tabachnick and fidell 2013 after modifications as the goodness of fit indices indicate in table 2 an acceptable fit to the data was achieved as a result all 28 remaining observed variables within the modified model properly represent three latent variables table 2 provides an overview of criteria for goodness of fit indices of the modified model convergent validity was assessed in order to examine construct validity the convergent validity is the correlation between two or more measures of a specific construct westen and rosenthal 2003 hair et al 2010 and it is assessed based on the standardized factor loading λ average variance extracted ave and composite reliability cr the factor loadings values should be equal or greater than 0 3 brown 2006 tabachnick and fidell 2013 and the acceptable values of the ave and cr were considered to be 0 5 and 0 7 respectively hair et al 2010 the results confirmed that all factor loadings are greater than 0 3 and the values of cr range from 0 808 to 0 866 indicating the adequate internal consistency of the constructs the ave was below the adequate value nevertheless fornell and larcker 1981 noted that if ave is less than 0 50 the variance due to measurement error is larger than the variance captured by the construct however based on the composite reliability alone researchers may conclude that the convergent validity of the construct is adequate even though more than 50 of the variance is due to the measurement error therefore as shown in table 3 the modified model had good convergent validity the results of the correlation matrix phi i e intercorrelations among all latent variables indicated that the constructs of efed efid and ted were positively related to one another fig 5 this means that changes in one observed variable of a given construct are associated with proportional changes in the other constructs hair et al 2010 the results also showed that the t values of all paths between observed variables and their underlying constructs were statistically significant table 3 fig 5 therefore these observed variables play a significant role in representing the three constructs moreover observed variables with higher factor loadings are representative of the construct hair et al 2010 table 3 in other words factor loadings indicate the correlation of each observed variable and the construct and they give us an idea about how much the variable has contributed to the construct yong and pearce 2013 hence those observed variables i e policy instruments which are highly related to their constructs play more roles in representing the construct and are more contributed to their construct based on the larger factor loadings the following policy

bandans were identified and grouped into three oecd dimensions based on the cfa the modified model which consisted of 28 policy instruments properly represents three reinforcing dimensions the following subsections include a discussion of the policy instruments which are more contributed to the improvement of the governance of ab bandans 6 1 improvement of effectiveness dimension 6 1 1 training farmers regarding conservation and optimal use of water interviewees believed that it is not possible to improve knowledge and perception of farmers regarding optimal use of water without adequate training and raised awareness for instance farmers have to be aware that storing water above the maximum storage level and keeping a reservoir full can destroy the reservoirs due to the generation of high waves thus training and building the capacity of farmers as end users for the protection of ab bandans is necessary it is imperative to note that the training approach should be based on a participatory learning process and knowledge sharing among farmers this is a totally different approach from simply delivering knowledge and it aims to strengthen the problem solving skills of farmers by fostering participation self confidence dialogue joint decision making and self determination röling and van de fliert 1994 this training approach increases farmers knowledge and empowers them to change their perspectives and behavior in order to be active in altering the current condition to a desired one hjorth 2003 interviewees added that training is not limited to farmers but water professionals and public officials have to be aware of the economic environmental and social values of ab bandans the importance of local stakeholders participation optimal utilization and management of water and related engineering and technical issues since the capacity of an organization strongly depends on the capabilities of its personnel training approach for professionals is a crucial policy for capacity building across the full range of water organizations it could be performed through specially designed courses modification of university courses in service modules seminars and workshops global water partnership 2017 6 1 2 reconstruction and modernization of ab bandans based on the interviewees opinion the infrastructure of a bandans has to be improved using advanced technology for instance installing modern gates and digital meters can control the volume of water entering and leaving the reservoirs and prevent water wastage when this has been done ab bandans as traditional water harvesting systems which are consistent with indigenous knowledge and culture can be integrated with modern irrigation networks i e dams and their interaction with dams in irrigation system could be determined the interviewees added that farmers should know the purpose and benefits of adopting water technology as well as the usage so that they are willing to participate in the adoption and maintenance of a given technology in this way ab bandans will be considered as small dams within rural communities which not only improve the economic conditions but also strengthen social cohesion and motivation to remain in the village as evans and sadler 2008 mentioned technology oriented policies e g advanced irrigation systems are appropriate tools for a more water efficient management as this protects and uses less water which in turn increases crop productivity and ultimately achieves an economic advantage for farmers akhmouch 2012 stated that new technologies and innovative water processes are effective for approaching cost effective objectives and water security which require the transfer of know how at the regional and local level especially when service delivery is not managed by the private sector levidow et al 2014 also concluded that proper use of technology is more important than technological investment which depends on applied research demonstration activities outreach farmers training and skills development 6 1 3 promoting meritocracy in administrative procedures to carry out duties interviewees stated that employing professionals in the water related public administration should be based on capabilities and competencies regardless of political orientation water professionals could carry out their tasks properly and play an effective role in the success of water organizations if they possess the necessary knowledge and skill in their job furthermore interviewees mentioned that top managers should regard thoughtful and knowledgeable professionals as an opportunity for water organizations and provide an atmosphere which aims at the acquisition of creative ideas meritocracy is one of the most basic aspects of organizational culture which emphasizes the link between individual merit and career without being biased against gender race class or any other non merit factors castilla and benard 2010 oecd 2015a highlighted that the most vital resource of each organization is its employees therefore employing public officials and professionals in the water sector should be merit oriented transparent and independent of political cycles 6 1 4 training farmers for acceptance of new projects regarding multiple functions of ab bandans according to the interviewees farmers should be involved in the process of studying designing and implementing new projects regarding multiple functions of ab bandans and they should be trained with regard to the importance and benefits of these projects during the process otherwise not only the project objectives cannot be achieved but these projects could also lead to conflicts and confrontation among different groups of beneficiaries and distrust of the government it must be kept in mind that the goals of rural development projects are not merely reaching economic benefits but also creating social products e g upgraded local leadership a culture of enterprise and innovative action increased engagement capacity among people to overcome problems and effective use of opportunities therefore the provision of educational policies for adoption of development programs seems to be necessary lowe et al 1999 oecd noya and clarence 2009 also reported that all members of the community should be empowered to cooperate in rural development through the enhancement of knowledge skills and competencies 6 2 improvement of efficiency dimension 6 2 1 long term and comprehensive plans for water resource management at the national and regional levels interviewees believed that a comprehensive and long term national plan for the sustainable conservation of water resources in consistence with the ecological economic and social features should be addressed moreover regional water management with respect to the role of ab bandans and the sustainable use of their various potentials should also be included in this national planning ardakanian 2005 believed that long term policies and strategies are required for water resource management in iran and establishing a comprehensive national water management system based on all elements of water cycle should be considered in water management policies in addition this system needs to be strongly linked to a national spatial strategy plan based on the natural water basins of the country ardakanian 2005 because water management and spatial planning are directly related to each other woltjer and al 2007 in other words regional plans for development exploitation and conservation of water resources have to be designed under the umbrella of national and comprehensive watershed based plans ardakanian 2005 6 2 2 using social media to create social network for water conservation social media can be useful as a tool for turning water threats into a social and inclusive concern as well as creating a public space to discuss them statement of one interviewee this is due to the fact that the application of social media as one of the most innovative means of information and communication technology has been widely welcomed recently boon and sinclair 2009 it allows certain slogans contents and ideas to spread rapidly as the main social media feature is its viral nature nalewajek and mącik 2013 in this way public officials can convey their messages to people and unite them for a common purpose terracina hartman et al 2013 the study of roshandel arbatani et al 2016 on zayandeh rood river in iran showed that social media strongly influenced the environmental behavior of citizens and improved their knowledge attitudes emotions and behaviors regarding environmental protection moreover social media led citizens to consider environmental hazards which were of no concern to them before membership in the virtual environmental groups and to participate financially in environmental protection in addition it provides a facility in which citizens are able to criticize the government s environmental policies 6 2 3 conducting experimentation and pilot projects on various potentials of ab bandans a simultaneous use of various functions of ab bandans should be tested in a number of cases and its social economic and environmental consequences should be carefully investigated interviewees believed that in advance of a wider introduction visiting pilot projects by farmers is an effective way of building trust in the government and increasing participation and awareness among farmers on the integrated use of potentials as political tools the pilots provide a good opportunity for policies and strategies to be tested before extensive implementation but also generate knowledge that can be transferred to the community vreugdenhil and slinger 2008 vreugdenhil et al 2010 the pilot projects are widely used to introduce government policies and plans nair and howlett 2015 and managers in the water sector regularly apply pilots as instruments for testing innovations and implementing policies on a small scale vreugdenhil et al 2010 according to the interviewees after ensuring that the pilots can be implemented on a large scale it is possible to continue by providing local people with loans at low cost interest rates in order to create jobs based on the potentials of ab bandans in the form of groups and associations and consequently improving income and livelihood in the communities ab bandans can be used as an income source for rural households in different ways e g a place for spending leisure and recreation time attracting tourists through building floating restaurants organizing fishing and boating tournaments etc creating sustainable jobs based on the potentials of ab bandans not only enhances a sense of ownership and participation in exploitation and maintenance processes but also contributes to the rural development and so prevents the migration of rural people especially new generations to the cities 6 2 4 encouraging local water market by public authorities a number of interviewees pointed out that recently farmers who are users of ab bandans sell water to other farmers within the village through the informal market when ab bandans have more water than they require this type of water market includes an informal agreement between neighboring farmers about how to share supplied or extracted water for mutual benefit based on the local agreement one farmer who allows access to his water to another farmer receives economic benefits nikolakis et al 2013 however faruqui 2001 emphasized that governments must undertake studies for water markets and make necessary legal institutional and economic reforms through involving multi stakeholders moreover nikolakis et al 2013 added that market based approaches in natural resource governance only have social legitimacy if they are consistent with the values of local stakeholders in addition a slow evolution of farmers mentality is required go mez limo n and martı nez 2006 334 6 3 improvement of trust and engagement dimension 6 3 1 enhancing participation and teamwork among farmers through improving their attitude this instrument plays more roles in the governance of ab bandans not only in the trust and engagement dimension but also in all dimensions according to one interviewee participation of farmers has to be the result of their intellectual development and internal desire and motivation encouraging farmers participation requires the promotion of their attitude towards collective preferences rather than individual and short term benefits if farmers have a positive attitude towards collective action they can see that participation in water related processes is beneficial both for themselves and for their society otherwise it is impossible to force them to actively engage the development of their attitude and willingness is an effective component for enhancing participation among farmers according to dungumaro and madulu 2003 fostering the sense of cooperation and participation in local communities through their involvement in the assessment and solving of water problems can also be effective for resolving conflicts this in turn can build trust between local stakeholders and water organizations which would lead to a sense of ownership and responsibility among local communities dungumaro and madulu 2003 interviewees highlighted the fact that public officials should also have a positive attitude towards the participation of farmers in the management of ab bandans it is important to understand that design and management of development projects outside rural areas which are then introduced into rural communities for implementation cannot be successful thus the attitude of the government that they know everything while rural people are inexperienced and not knowledgeable should move towards bottom up development and putting people first oakley 1991 based on interviews conducted it was revealed that the government should undertake the role of a facilitator in the management of ab bandans rather than administrator and executor and should conduct participatory management for ab bandans interviewees emphasized that the management of ab bandans should be given to farmers in the form of water user associations wanga et al 2006 believed that farmers are the key decision makers and should decide on their roles as well as the activities and roles which they want their managers and leaders to perform indeed farmers are able to participate in a collective manner in all aspects of water management including physical financial decision making evaluation and monitoring aspects wanga et al 2006 6 3 2 developing trust in public officials through addressing farmers and their needs in water related decisions and planning collective attitudes and participatory behavior of farmers are essential for water management but trust in the government is also important for successful participatory governance because if farmers do not trust government officials the likelihood of their participation is reduced lubell 2004 according to one interviewee building trust in the government can lead to the participation of farmers in the adoption of new projects regarding the various potentials of ab bandans in fact farmers should feel that meeting their needs is the main concern of the government in the management of ab bandans so that they can trust the government and show participatory and peaceful behavior most water conflicts in the agricultural sector in iran are between government as an administrator of water management and farmers as users bijani and hayati 2011 therefore building public trust in the government through democratic legitimacy and fairness plays a vital role as a principle in water governance oecd 2015 6 3 3 mitigating conflicts among local stakeholders one interviewee cited that farmers have to reach social maturity and social acceptance of each other it appears that the achievement of an agreement among local stakeholders and the admittance of each other are crucial in order to solve barriers and create a participatory approach to the governance of ab bandans according to the interviewees water policy should be based on conflicts resolution among local stakeholders using mechanisms such as strengthening rural dispute resolution councils promoting a culture of dialogue and unbiased government intervention swatuk et al 2008 said that promoting effective communication and collaboration in spite of diverse interests identifying the causes of conflicts building trust and planning in a participatory manner should be considered in the management of conflicts this should include the employment of various methods e g negotiation mediation conciliation and consensus building swatuk et al 2008 bijani and hayati 2011 argued that change from governmentality to governance is the best way to reduce and eliminate water conflicts in iran which need cultural enhancement public participation government support without being authoritative and training of local stakeholders it should be considered that water conflicts cannot be solved simply through a series of fixed and written laws but people and their participation should be implemented for overcoming contradictions in this way in addition to conflicts management social capital in rural communities is improved and local traditions and social institutions are regenerated bijani and hayati 2011 6 3 4 ensuring the transparency of public officials performance in the water sector through mass media interviewees stated that there should be some conditions in the water sector where criticism and comments about the performance of responsible authorities does not lead to punishment or retaliation but is rather seen as an opportunity to correct mistakes they emphasized that freedom of speech with regard to criticism and assessment of the performance of public authorities and their policies in mass media plays a crucial role in the promotion of accountability and transparency dunu 2013 noted that institutions and governments should be accountable and transparent for their policies and performance because according to ashraf 2014 people must know what their governments are doing consequently policy failures maladministration corruption and scandals in public administration and their related entities can be highlighted through mass media in order to promote responsiveness and transparency among all citizens ashraf 2014 the fact is that all aspects of good governance including accountability transparency participation rule of law efficiency effectiveness etc are facilitated by using a strong pluralistic and independent media within the society dunu 2013 7 conclusion the result showed that 28 out of 31 policy instruments identified properly contribute to the improvement of the governance of ab bandans however the enhancement of participation and collective action among farmers due to the highest factor loading among all the instruments in three dimensions is more contributed to the improvement of water governance therefore it can be seen as the starting point for the desired transformation even if participation cannot be seen as the new orthodoxy it is clear that participation has become one of the central influences in mainstream development thinking parfitt 2004 537 consequently farmers willingness to participate in management processes and their collective action can be seen as a panacea for enhancing the governance of ab bandans to this end the top down paradigm of government should be changed into a bottom up paradigm and participatory governance and the government should undertake the role of a facilitator rather than governmentality in the governance of ab bandans moreover the significant issue is that each dimension in the improvement of the governance of ab bandans interacts with the other dimensions therefore the policy instruments are interdependent and shouldn t be addressed in isolation the improvement of the governance of ab bandans should be systematic and it is not possible to apply a single policy instrument without considering the impact of other policy instruments it is necessary to adopt the policy instruments in a holistic way to solve difficulties in the governance of ab bandans this study has some limitations including the sample size in the quantitative phase furthermore water governance is strongly dependent on context ab bandans are just restricted to northern iran so these policy instruments cannot be generalized in respect of other areas in iran nevertheless these instruments can be used as a basis for other case studies in the country with reference to rivers lakes underground waters although the results of this study are a good starting point for creating a positive change in the governance of ab bandans further research could be conducted to assess the ex ante or ex post effect of each policy instrument in the improvement of the governance of ab bandans it calls for further data and analysis in which the viewpoints of farmers can be covered acknowledgments this paper is part of a ph d study which was conducted by the first author at the university of hohenheim germany it is an output of a

11284,the north china plain ncp is the main wheat production area in china however irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer use in this area is relatively inefficient and must be optimized to attain higher yield and resource use efficiency for winter wheat in this study a four year field experiment was conducted during the 2012 2016 growing seasons under quota irrigation conditions an experiment with various micro sprinkling frequencies s2 irrigation at jointing and anthesis s3 irrigation at jointing booting and filling and s4 irrigation at jointing booting anthesis and filling was conducted in 2012 2014 in 2014 2016 different nitrogen application rates 150 195 and 240 kg n ha 1 denoted as s4n1 s4n2 and s4n3 respectively under the s4 condition were tested the local traditional flood irrigation pattern was designated as the control ck in 2012 2016 the grain yield leaf area index of the population lai flag leaf senescence during gain filling accumulation and distribution of dry matter and nitrogen and water and nitrogen use characteristics were investigated the results showed that no significant difference was observed in grain yield between the ck and s2 whereas s4 and s3 showed increased grain yields of 5 7 22 2 and 4 6 19 1 respectively compared with the ck the increase of yield in micro sprinkling treatments was mainly due to a significant increase in the 1000 grain weight with increasing irrigation frequency the lai at the filling stage improved significantly the flag leaf chlorophyll content decreased slowly and the total dry matter accumulation dry matter after anthesis and its contribution to grain yield increased significantly meanwhile the total water consumption of s4 n2 decreased significantly and the water use efficiency increased by 10 0 27 8 compared with the ck in addition micro sprinkling irrigation with frequent application of a small amount of water with optimized nitrogen application s4n2 yielded the highest nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency water consumption and nitrogen accumulation during grain filling were significantly increased in s4 which could explain the higher yield and resource use efficiency of s4 overall a suitable micro sprinkling irrigation frequency s4 and nitrogen application 195 kg n ha 1 can achieve higher grain yields and resource use efficiencies in the ncp keywords micro sprinkling irrigation water and nitrogen use winter wheat yield 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is the primary food producing region in china accounting for 60 of the national wheat production zhang et al 2015 however in this area the annual rainfall is uneven and mainly concentrates in the summer maize season while only 20 30 falls in the winter wheat growing season which meets only 25 40 of winter wheat requirements liu et al 2001 thus supplemental irrigation with groundwater is used to provide the water required for winter wheat production however overuse of groundwater for wheat production has resulted in a rapid decline in the groundwater table threatening sustainable agricultural development in this region zhang et al 2004 with the development of water saving agricultural techniques the main irrigation pattern in this area involves two irrigations one at jointing and one at anthesis during the wheat growing season the total amount of irrigation water applied is about 1500 m3 ha 1 li et al 2010 wang et al 2016 nevertheless problems related to groundwater overuse remain serious under this irrigation regime sun et al 2015 therefore the development of an optimized irrigation regime is urgently required to further improve the grain yield and water use efficiency wue of winter wheat in the ncp surface irrigation is used widely in the ncp liu et al 2013 which often involves a one time application that supplies too much irrigation water making it difficult to increase the wue to improve the efficiency of water use in agriculture various advanced water saving techniques have been used in agricultural production for example wang et al 2013a b suggested that under deficit irrigation conditions employing drip irrigation could significantly increase grain yield reduce irrigation water consumption and improve the wue of winter wheat in addition dar et al 2017 reported that suitable timing and depth of drip irrigation resulted in higher crop water productivity compared with flooding irrigation similarly many studies have found that sprinkler irrigation can increase the grain yield and wue of wheat bandyopadhyay et al 2010 liu et al 2013 micro sprinkling irrigation is a new technology that has been applied to field production in recent years irrigation with micro sprinkling hoses has the advantages of both drip and sprinkler irrigation man et al 2014a moreover compared with drip irrigation micro sprinkling irrigation can reduce the required inputs research has shown that micro sprinkling irrigation greatly improves the irrigation uniformity when the optimal sprinkling angle and hose length are chosen thus improving the winter wheat yield and wue man et al 2014a b nevertheless there is little research on grain yield formation and water consumption characteristics under different micro sprinkling irrigation frequencies nitrogen is one of the main plant nutrients that affect plant growth sadras and lawson 2013 to increase crop yield the nitrogen application rate continues to increase each year liu et al 2008 cui et al 2010 however too much nitrogen fertilizer does not increase crop production and nutrient use mon et al 2016 and the efficiency is relatively low due to nitrogen loss wang et al 2014 sinclair and rufty 2012 reported that a key parameter for increasing yield may be to increase nitrogen uptake later in the growth cycle and increasing the total nitrogen storage pool appears to be essential for gaining further yield increases micro sprinkling irrigation can realize the postponed application of nitrogen by integrating water and fertilizer application however there is insufficient research on the effects of integrating water and fertilizer application under micro sprinkling irrigation with different nitrogen fertilizer rates in winter wheat in this study we hypothesized that the optimized micro sprinkling irrigation scheduling with suitable nitrogen fertilizer rate in winter wheat can ensure water and nitrogen supply during grain filling in the upper soil layer reduce the risk of soil nitrate leaching into deeper soil layers and delay the senescence of leaves increase the dry matter production during grain filling and improve grain weight and finally improve the grain yield and the use efficiency of water and nitrogen by postponing the application of water and nitrogen fertilizer to test this hypothesis a four year experiment with different micro sprinkling frequencies and nitrogen rates was conducted and the leaf area index lai the chlorophyll content of flag leaf after anthesis the dry matter and nitrogen accumulation yield and yield components and the utilization of water and nitrogen were investigated under the integrated water and nitrogen micro sprinkling irrigation 2

treatments the micro sprinkling system included water and fertilizer integration technology the high yield wheat triticum aestivum l cultivar jimai22 was used in the experiments which is one of the most important and widely planted crops in hebei province wheat seeds were sown on 15 october with a row spacing of 15 cm the micro sprinkling hose design and details of the orifice arrangement have been described by man et al 2014b the micro sprinkling hoses were 30 m long with a flow rate of 6 0 m3 h 1 and the sprinkling angle of the micro sprinkling hose was 80 each experimental plot consisted of 24 rows of wheat spaced 15 cm apart the inter row spaces between wheat rows were named l1 to l23 the micro sprinkling hose was laid between l6 and l18 respectively i e the sprinkled range of each side of every micro sprinkling hose is one meter fig 2 well water was used as the water source before sowing 105 kg n ha 1 150 p2o5 kg ha 1 and 90 kg k2o ha 1 were applied as base fertilizer for each micro sprinkling irrigation application urea as top dressing was completely dissolved in a fertilization device fig 2 and applied together with irrigation water while in the flood irrigation treatment urea was spread over the fields before irrigation at the jointing stage 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 crop phenology crop phenology was recorded using the zadoks scale zadoks et al 1974 following the average phenology of the plot when 50 of shoots reached at main developmental stage the corresponding dates were recorded when the 1st node was detectable jointing z31 50 of spikes have extruded at least one anther beginning of anthesis z61 and the grain is difficult to divide by thumbnail maturity z91 2 3 2 leaf area index of the population and chlorophyll content of flag leaf at anthesis and the grain filling stage 20 days after anthesis the green leaf area was measured by a li 3100 area meter li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa and calculated green leaf area index lai for the chlorophyll content analysis 20 flag leaf samples were randomly collected at five day intervals starting from the first day of anthesis to maturity i e on 0 5 15 20 25 and 30 days after anthesis fresh samples were stored at 25 c until the biochemical assays were performed the flag leaf chlorophyll a b content was extracted with 95 alcohol and measured with a spectrophotometer 2 3 3 dry matter accumulation and grain yield the aboveground parts of all plants from two 50 cm sites avoiding border rows in each plot were sampled at jointing anthesis and maturity and were oven dried at 75 c until reaching a constant weight after which the biomass was measured dry matter translocation dmt from the vegetative portions to the grain between anthesis and maturity was calculated following the methods of hu et al 2007 and shi et al 2016 dmt was calculated as the difference between dry matter accumulation dma at anthesis and dma at maturity without grain weight dma during grain filling was calculated as the difference between grain weight at maturity and dmt the contribution of dry matter during grain filling to grain weight was calculated from the ratio of dma during grain filling to grain weight at maturity the harvest index hi is the ratio of grain yield to total aboveground dry matter accumulation at maturity xue et al 2014 to determine the grain yield spikes were counted in six 1 m central rows of each plot before harvest the grain number per spike was determined by counting the kernels in each spike from 60 randomly selected plants in each plot before harvesting at maturity wheat plants from a 3 m2 area in each plot were harvested and threshed for the grain yield determination the actual grain yield was reported on a 13 moisture basis the 1000 grain weight tgw was calculated by weighing 1000 seeds from each sample and averaged from three replicates 2 3 4 soil water consumption and water use efficiency the soil water content was measured at sowing jointing

difference between sowing and maturity r is runoff d is drainage below the 200 cm soil profile and cr is capillary rise into the root zone because the groundwater table at the experimental site is 7 9 m 4 m below the ground surface cr is negligible r and d can also be ignored in the ncp including at the experimental site wang et al 2013a b the water consumption percentage for a given stage cp is the ratio of the water consumption amount of that stage ca to the total et the wue for grain yield was calculated as follows xue et al 2014 wue gy et where gy kg ha 1 is grain yield and et mm is the total seasonal crop et during the period of wheat growth 2 3 5 nitrogen absorption and utilization the total nitrogen content in plants was determined using the kjeldahl method dordas and sioulas 2009 nitrogen accumulation and use were calculated as follows according to ruisi et al 2016 total n accumulation nt dm nc grain n accumulation ng gy nc nfue gy nf ncr na nm ng 100 nhi ng nt where dm is the dry matter accumulation of plants at the different growth stages nc is the nitrogen concentration of plants or grain nfue is nitrogen fertilizer production efficiency nf is the applied amount of

accumulation were analyzed according to the analysis of variance using glm in spss ver 17 0 spss inc chicago il usa differences were judged by the least significant differences test using a 0 05 level of significance 3 results 3 1 grain yield and yield components in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 growth seasons the grain yield was significantly influenced by year type y irrigation schedules i and the interaction between year and irrigation schedules y i table 2 as shown in table 3 there were no significant differences in spike number and kernel number per spike among ck s2 s3 and s4 treatments in the 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 growing seasons however the grain yield and tgw increased significantly as the micro sprinkling frequency increased from two times s2 to four times s4 whereas the difference in yield between s3 and s4 was non significant as was the difference between ck and s2 compared with the ck the tgw and grain yield of s4 increased by 7 6 9 4 and 5 7 22 2 in the two years respectively and the higher increase occurred in 2013 2014 growing season which may be due to the higher rainfall in grain filling stage of may in 2013 2014 than in 2012 2013 fig 1 although the total rainfall was lower in 2013 2014 137 1 mm than in 2012 2013 161 3 mm in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 growing seasons the grain yield was significantly influenced by year type y nitrogen rate n table 2 the grain yield of s4n2 was significantly higher than that of the ck in both years and the grain yields of s4n1 and s4n3 were similar to the ck in 2014 2015 while they were significantly higher than the ck in 2015 2016 table 3 the tgw first increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen level however all tgws in the micro sprinkling irrigation treatments were higher than that in the ck therefore the increase in the grain yield of the micro sprinkling treatments was mainly due to the increase in the tgw in addition the grain yield in 2014 2015 was significantly higher than in 2015 2016 for all the treatments which may be due to the higher rainfall in april and total growing season of 2014 2015 than in 2015 2016 fig 1 thus obtaining the higher spike number in 2014 2015 growing season in this study with increasing micro sprinkling irrigation frequency the hi improved significantly in 2012 2014 in 2014 2016 under the micro sprinkling irrigation with different nitrogen application levels s4n2 yielded the highest hi 3 2 lai at different growth stages and flag leaf chlorophyll content during grain filling the lai at key crop growth stages is very important to yield in 2013 2014 there was no significant difference in the lai at anthesis between ck and s2 but they were significantly higher than those of s3 and s4 at the filling stage s3 and s4 had significantly higher lais than ck and s2 where s4 had the highest value fig 3 in 2014 2015 there was no significant difference in the lai between ck and s4n3 at anthesis but they were significantly higher than those of s4n1 and s4n2 at the filling stage the lais of s4n2 and s4n3 were significantly higher than those of ck and s4n1 however there was no significant difference between s4n2 and s4n3 in short increasing the micro sprinkling frequency with appropriate nitrogen application can support higher lais at the filling stage flag leaf senescence after anthesis was investigated every five days in 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 the chlorophyll content of the flag leaf after anthesis first increased and then decreased in all treatments in both years in 2013 2014 s2 showed similar changes as the ck whereas s3 and s4 showed significantly postponed declines in the flag leaf chlorophyll content days after anthesis 15th daa 15 which was more obvious in s4 fig 4 in 2014 2015 the micro sprinkling irrigation treatments all showed significantly postponed flag leaf senescence days after anthesis 15th daa 15 where s4n2 and s4n3 showed more significant effects than s4n1 however there was no significant difference between s4n2 and s4n3 before daa 15 and the flag leaves chlorophyll content of s4n3 was significantly higher than that of s4n2 after daa 20 the higher leaf chlorophyll content of s4n3 during the later grain filling maybe result in the leaves remaining green and delaying crop maturity than others treatments which is the reason for higher nitrogen application decreased grain weight and yield table 3 overall micro sprinkling irrigation with more frequent applications of smaller amounts of water and proper nitrogen fertilization can postpone flag leaf senescence and maintain photosynthesis in leaves 3 3 dry matter accumulation the dry matter accumulation in different stages of wheat varied among the treatments fig 5 in 2013 2014 there was no significant difference in dry matter accumulation at maturity dmm between ck and s2 but s4 had a significantly higher dry matter accumulation than s2 s3 and ck micro sprinkling more frequently s3 and s4 increased the dry matter accumulation during the grain filling and decreased the dry matter accumulation at seeding jointing and jointing anthesis compared with the ck in 2014 2015 s4n2 and s4n3 significantly increased the dmm compared with the ck while s4n1 had a lower dmm than the ck all micro sprinkling treatments showed increased dry matter accumulation during the grain filling where s4n2 was significantly higher than s4n1 and s4n3 overall the results for the two years showed that increasing the micro sprinkling frequency with proper nitrogen application increased the dmm and the dry matter accumulation during the grain filling the contribution of dry matter accumulation after anthesis to grain yield improved significantly with increasing micro sprinkling irrigation frequency however there was no significant difference between s3 and s4 fig 6 when micro sprinkling irrigation with water was conducted four times the different nitrogen application treatments also improved the contribution of dry matter accumulation after anthesis to grain yield compared with the ck s4n2 and s4n3 improved the contribution rate of dry accumulation after anthesis to grain yield by 31 3 and 17 8 respectively 3 4 soil nitrogen use 3 4 1 population nitrogen accumulation and nitrogen use efficiency nitrogen accumulation and the allocation proportion ap at different stages showed similar changes in the 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 growing seasons table 4 the total nitrogen accumulation was higher in the micro sprinkling treatments than in the ck and the highest one occurred in s4n2 based on the nitrogen accumulation amount na there was no significant difference from seeding to jointing between the ck and micro sprinkling treatments however the nitrogen ap of the ck was significantly higher than that of the micro sprinkling treatments in both years from jointing to anthesis the na and ap of s4n1 were lower than that of the ck while s4n2 and s4n3 had higher values than the ck in 2014 2015 the ap of all micro sprinkling treatments was lower than the ck in 2015 2016 however the na and ap after anthesis in all micro sprinkling treatments were higher than the ck in both years the grain nitrogen accumulation amount followed the order s4n2 s4n3 s4n1 ck in both years compared with the ck the nhi did not improve under the micro sprinkling treatments but rather decreased in s4n3 all nitrogen application levels under micro sprinkling irrigation showed improved contribution rates of nitrogen accumulation during grain filling in plants to the grain nitrogen accumulation at maturity and there was no significant difference in the nitrogen accumulation at maturity between s4n1 and s4n2 in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 compared with the ck s4n1 s4n2 and s4n3 showed increased nitrogen accumulations at maturity that were 53 9 127 9 62 5 123 0 and 27 9 101 5 higher than ck in both years respectively the nitrogen fertilizer production efficiency nfue of s4n2 was significantly higher than that of the ck in both years while s4n1 and s4n3 had similar nfue values to the ck in 2014 2015 and significantly higher nfue values than the ck in 2015 2016 table 4 the highest nfue was recorded for s4n2 in both years and the higher nitrogen application level s4n3 resulted in a lower nfue 3 4 2 temporal and spatial variation of soil no3 n content soil no3 n content snc in the 200 cm soil depth of all treatments decreased first and then increased with increasing soil layer fig 7 it gradually decreased from anthesis to maturity due to the large amount of soil nitrogen was absorbed by the plants at the anthesis stage in the 2014 2015 growing season due to more precipitation at booting anthesis in 0 20 cm soil layer no significant difference was observed between ck and s4n3 and it was significantly decreased in s4n2 and s4n1 the snc in s4n1 was the lowest in 20 40 cm soil layer besides s4n1 s4n2 and s4n3 was higher than ck from 40 to 160 cm soil layer due to n leaching the snc of ck was significantly higher than micro sprinkling irrigation treatments in 2015 2016 in 0 40 cm soil layer the snc of micro sprinkling irrigation was significantly higher than that of ck which was mainly due to the n application in the micro irrigation treatments at the booting stage and it was increased with the increase of nitrogen application amount in the upper soil profile below 60 cm soil layer the snc of ck was significantly higher than that of micro sprinkling and s4n3 was higher than s4n2 and s4n1 at filling and maturity the snc of ck in the upper soil layers continued to decrease while micro sprinkling irrigation maintained a relatively high content and micro sprinkling promoted the absorption of nitrogen in the deep soil layer because the snc in the deep soil layer was significantly lower in the micro irrigation treatments than in ck at maturity particularly in s4n1 in conclusion compared with ck the micro sprinkling irrigation treatments ensured the nitrogen supply in the upper soil profile 0 40 cm during the grain filling and the soil water content was lower than ck in 60 80 cm soil profile and it may reduce the movement of no3 n to the deeper soil layer increase absorption and utilization of stored nitrogen in the deeper soil and reduce the risk of no3 n leaching into deep soil 3 5 soil water use 3 5 1 seasonal evapotranspiration and water use efficiency in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 growing seasons the total evapotranspiration et was significantly influenced by year type y irrigation schedules i and the interaction between year and irrigation schedules y i table 2 in 2012 2013 s2 and s3 had similar et levels as the ck while s4 had lower et than the ck fig 8 in 2013 2014 s2 had a similar et as the ck while s3 and s4 had lower et levels than the ck in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 growing seasons the season et was significantly influenced by year type y nitrogen application rate n but the interaction between y and n was no significant difference y n table 2 as shown in fig 8 all of the micro sprinkling irrigation treatments had lower et levels than the ck which first increased and then decreased as nitrogen rate increased the decrease in et was mainly due to the decrease in soil water consumption because the total irrigation amount and precipitation were the same for the different treatments in each year regarding water consumption in each stage there was no significant difference in the water consumption amount ca daily water consumption cd and water consumption percentage cp among the treatments from sowing to jointing in 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 table 5 increasing the micro sprinkling frequency decreased the ca cd and cp from jointing to anthesis but increased the ca cd and cp from anthesis to maturity in 2013 2014 and the highest ca cd and cp values post anthesis were observed for s4 followed by s3 s2 and ck in 2014 2015 all of the micro sprinkling treatments had lower ca cd and cp values from jointing to anthesis and had higher ca cd and cp values from anthesis to maturity compared with the ck and the highest water consumption from jointing to anthesis was obtained in s4n3 followed by s4n2 and s4n1 the highest water consumption from anthesis to maturity was obtained in s4n1 and s4n2 followed by s4n3 the water use efficiency wue was significantly influenced by irrigation schedules nitrogen rate and the interaction between year and irrigation schedules table 2 compared with the ck micro sprinkling more frequently s4 significantly increased the wue in all four years fig 8 in 2012 2013 there was no significant difference in the wue between the ck and s2 meanwhile in 2013 2014 s2 had a higher wue than the ck but there was no significant difference between s3 and s4 although s4 had a higher wue in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 all micro sprinkling treatments had higher wue than the ck and with increasing nitrogen application the wue first increased and then decreased the highest wue was obtained at s4n2 in brief the results of the four year experiment showed that due to a significant increase in grain yield and decrease in et s4 or s4n2 increased the wue by 19 3 compared with the ck 3 5 2 temporal and spatial variation of soil water content in this study the difference in soil water content swc was significant at the same growth stage among the different treatments and they all decreased first and then increased with an increase in soil depth fig 9 in 2013 2014 growing season there was no significant difference in the swc in 0 200 cm between ck and s2 at anthesis filling and maturity stages however at anthesis the swc of s4 in the 0 40 cm soil depth was significantly higher than that of other treatments and s3 was the lowest which may have been due to irrigation with 30 mm of water in s4 at the booting stage while there was no irrigation in ck and s2 especially in s3 which only irrigation with 45 mm of water at jointing stage in 60 120 cm soil depth the swc of ck and s2 were significantly higher than that of s4 and s3 and s3 was the lowest whereas there was little difference below the 140 cm soil layer at the filling stage the swc of ck and s2 in the 0 100 cm soil layer were higher than that of s3 and s4 and s4 was the lowest no significant difference was observed below the 120 140 cm soil layer among treatments while the swc of s3 and s4 was lower than that of ck and s2 the higher swc of ck and s2 in the upper soil profile may have been due to more irrigation at anthesis and the smaller water supply of s3 and s4 at booing and anthesis stages may promote the absorption and use of deeper soil moisture at maturity the swc of s3 and s4 in the upper soil profile was higher than that of s2 and ck but slightly lower than ck and s2 in the deeper soil profile in 2014 2015 growing season the regularity of swc with s4 was basically coincident to the previous year however water consumption was reduced by increasing or decreasing nitrogen application overall compared with ck and s2 the s4 treatments ensured upper swc at the critical growth stages and promoted utilization of water in the deep soil profile during grain filling 4 discussion micro sprinkling is an advanced irrigation method applied to field crop that is considered to be more efficient than traditional flood irrigation liu et al 2011 man et al 2014a 2014b 2017 in this study the results of a four year experiment showed that under the quota irrigation conditions micro sprinkling with a suitable amount of nitrogen at the jointing booting anthesis and filling stages i e treatment s4 increased the grain yield wue and nfue there were some differences in the grain yield wue and nfue of s4 n2 among the years but overall this treatment showed the best results of all treatments in the four years compared with the ck all s4 n2 treatments exceeded 8900 kg ha 1 and the yield increased by 5 7 22 2 the wue increased by 10 0 27 8 and the nfue increased by 10 4 16 8 4 1 the dry matter production during grain filling and crop yield the grain yield of wheat is separated into three components spike number grain number per spike and grain weight increases in wheat yield have been achieved by increasing the grain number bustos et al 2013 while grain weight has not changed substantially austin et al 1980 waddington et al 1986 further increases in yield are possible by increasing the grain weight bustos et al 2013 liang et al 2017 the grain filling stage is the critical period for grain weight and yield formation and increase post anthesis dry matter production is an important means to increase wheat grain yield shi et al 2016 in our four year study micro sprinkling treatment with smaller amounts of water more frequently i e treatment s4 had little influence on spike number and kernels per spike but significantly increased the grain weight table 3 which was the main cause of the higher grain yield in s4 plaut et al 2004 reported that grain filling in wheat is affected by the current photosynthates produced in leaves and stems and the mobilization of stored carbohydrates within these organs micro sprinkling with smaller amounts of water more frequently delayed flag leaf senescence fig 4 and yielded a higher lai at the grain filling stage fig 3 which promoted the production of dry matter accumulation during grain filling period fig 5 increased the grain weight and increased the contribution of dry matter post anthesis to grain yield fig 6 this is in agreement with previous studies that have found that increases in crop yield due to optimized irrigation results from higher biomass accumulation during the grain filling stage gao et al 2017 4 2 irrigation scheduling and water use efficiency wue the timing and amount of irrigation are two critical factors for improving the wue under limited water supply conditions wang 2017 wang et al 2004 reported that a suitable water supply after anthesis could increase the grain yield improve grain quality and increase the wue moreover crop et was estimated from irrigation precipitation and soil water depletion and was affected by irrigation regimes dar et al 2017 micro sprinkling irrigation enables more frequent applications of smaller amounts of water and it has been reported that micro sprinkling irrigation improves the uniformity of irrigation and increases the wue man et al 2014b in this four year study the s4 n2 treatment had a higher grain yield and lower et than the ck i e traditional flood irrigation table 3 which resulted in a higher wue in s4 n2 fig 8 what s more under the s4 condition swc in the upper soil profile was higher than in ck during the grain filling period whereas it was slightly lower than ck in the deeper soil layer which showed that s4 ensured the upper swc at grain filling period and promoted the utilization of water in the deep soil layer fig 9 this was also beneficial to increase wue in addition under the optional micro sprinkling irrigation condition s4n2 the dry matter accumulation was significantly lower during jointing anthesis and significantly enhanced during anthesis maturity table 5 the water and nitrogen fertilizer supply after anthesis ensured the dry matter production during grain filling stage figs 5 and 9 which was another reason that s4 n2 resulted in a higher grain yield and wue 4 3 nitrogen fertilizer application and nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency nfue nitrogen fertilizer is important for increasing crop yields however researches have showed that over fertilization can reduce crop yield and fertilizer use efficiency song et al 2009 hao et al 2014 traditional fertilizer application often involves one application of too much fertilizer resulting in the volatilization leaching and decomposition of nitrogen leading to a lower nfue pollution of groundwater and negative effects on the environment gheysari et al 2009 li et al 2018 micro sprinkling irrigation can realize the use of smaller amounts of water and fertilizer with more frequent applications and nitrogen fertilizer can be applied at critical growth periods the present study showed that integrating water and nitrogen application with micro sprinkling could postpone nitrogen application s4n2 which ensured which ensured the soil n distribution in the upper soil profile and increased nitrogen absorption during grain filling fig 7 thus increasing the chlorophyll content and delaying flag leaf senescence figs 3 and 4 and its beneficial to guarantee photosynthetic production after anthesis and increases the grain yield and nitrogen fertilizer utilization efficiency table 3 and 4 similarly guo et al 2006 found that nitrogen application at a later growing stage in spring wheat guaranteed the leaf function and increased the grain weight however the higher leaf chlorophyll content of s4n3 during the later grain filling maybe result in the leaves remaining green and delaying crop maturity than others treatments fig 4 which is the reason for higher nitrogen application decreased grain weight and yield in addition due to the postponement of water and nitrogen application the lower nitrogen rate treatment s4n1 resulted in a comparable or higher grain yield and nfue than the ck while the same nitrogen rate treatment s4n2 as the ck had a significantly higher grain yield and nfue further increasing the nitrogen rate s4n3 decreased grain yield and nfue tables 3 and 4 in brief the highest yield and nfue as well as nitrogen accumulation amount and percentage during the grain filling period and its contribution to grain nitrogen were achieved by applying smaller amounts of water more frequently with micro sprinkling and an appropriate amount of nitrogen 195 kg ha 1 overall the results of the four year experiment indicated that micro sprinkling with smaller amounts of water more frequently and appropriate nitrogen application can realize high grain yield and high resource use efficiency however further studies are required to clarify the mechanism of the high yield and high resource use efficiency for the integration of water and fertilizer with micro sprinkling and the root distribution as well as changes in the micro environment of the winter wheat canopy 5 conclusions optimal micro sprinkling irrigation scheduling s4n2 significantly increased the grain yield wue and nfue of winter wheat by 5 7 22 2 10 0 27 8 and 10 4 16 8 respectively compared with traditional irrigation the higher yield in the s4 n2 treatment was due to the increase in the absorption of water and nitrogen after anthesis which delayed leaf senescence increased dry matter accumulation during grain filling and increased the tgw overall under the proper application of nitrogen micro sprinkling with smaller amounts of water more frequently and fertilizer integration is promising as a highly efficient water and fertilizer management method in the ncp acknowledgements we are

11284,the north china plain ncp is the main wheat production area in china however irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer use in this area is relatively inefficient and must be optimized to attain higher yield and resource use efficiency for winter wheat in this study a four year field experiment was conducted during the 2012 2016 growing seasons under quota irrigation conditions an experiment with various micro sprinkling frequencies s2 irrigation at jointing and anthesis s3 irrigation at jointing booting and filling and s4 irrigation at jointing booting anthesis and filling was conducted in 2012 2014 in 2014 2016 different nitrogen application rates 150 195 and 240 kg n ha 1 denoted as s4n1 s4n2 and s4n3 respectively under the s4 condition were tested the local traditional flood irrigation pattern was designated as the control ck in 2012 2016 the grain yield leaf area index of the population lai flag leaf senescence during gain filling accumulation and distribution of dry matter and nitrogen and water and nitrogen use characteristics were investigated the results showed that no significant difference was observed in grain yield between the ck and s2 whereas s4 and s3 showed increased grain yields of 5 7 22 2 and 4 6 19 1 respectively compared with the ck the increase of yield in micro sprinkling treatments was mainly due to a significant increase in the 1000 grain weight with increasing irrigation frequency the lai at the filling stage improved significantly the flag leaf chlorophyll content decreased slowly and the total dry matter accumulation dry matter after anthesis and its contribution to grain yield increased significantly meanwhile the total water consumption of s4 n2 decreased significantly and the water use efficiency increased by 10 0 27 8 compared with the ck in addition micro sprinkling irrigation with frequent application of a small amount of water with optimized nitrogen application s4n2 yielded the highest nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency water consumption and nitrogen accumulation during grain filling were significantly increased in s4 which could explain the higher yield and resource use efficiency of s4 overall a suitable micro sprinkling irrigation frequency s4 and nitrogen application 195 kg n ha 1 can achieve higher grain yields and resource use efficiencies in the ncp keywords micro sprinkling irrigation water and nitrogen use winter wheat yield 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is the primary food producing region in china accounting for 60 of the national wheat production zhang et al 2015 however in this area the annual rainfall is uneven and mainly concentrates in the summer maize season while only 20 30 falls in the winter wheat growing season which meets only 25 40 of winter wheat requirements liu et al 2001 thus supplemental irrigation with groundwater is used to provide the water required for winter wheat production however overuse of groundwater for wheat production has resulted in a rapid decline in the groundwater table threatening sustainable agricultural development in this region zhang et al 2004 with the development of water saving agricultural techniques the main irrigation pattern in this area involves two irrigations one at jointing and one at anthesis during the wheat growing season the total amount of irrigation water applied is about 1500 m3 ha 1 li et al 2010 wang et al 2016 nevertheless problems related to groundwater overuse remain serious under this irrigation regime sun et al 2015 therefore the development of an optimized irrigation regime is urgently required to further improve the grain yield and water use efficiency wue of winter wheat in the ncp surface irrigation is used widely in the ncp liu et al 2013 which often involves a one time application that supplies too much irrigation water making it difficult to increase the wue to improve the efficiency of water use in agriculture various advanced water saving techniques have been used in agricultural production for example wang et al 2013a b suggested that under deficit irrigation conditions employing drip irrigation could significantly increase grain yield reduce irrigation water consumption and improve the wue of winter wheat in addition dar et al 2017 reported that suitable timing and depth of drip irrigation resulted in higher crop water productivity compared with flooding irrigation similarly many studies have found that sprinkler irrigation can increase the grain yield and wue of wheat bandyopadhyay et al 2010 liu et al 2013 micro sprinkling irrigation is a new technology that has been applied to field production in recent years irrigation with micro sprinkling hoses has the advantages of both drip and sprinkler irrigation man et al 2014a moreover compared with drip irrigation micro sprinkling irrigation can reduce the required inputs research has shown that micro sprinkling irrigation greatly improves the irrigation uniformity when the optimal sprinkling angle and hose length are chosen thus improving the winter wheat yield and wue man et al 2014a b nevertheless there is little research on grain yield formation and water consumption characteristics under different micro sprinkling irrigation frequencies nitrogen is one of the main plant nutrients that affect plant growth sadras and lawson 2013 to increase crop yield the nitrogen application rate continues to increase each year liu et al 2008 cui et al 2010 however too much nitrogen fertilizer does not increase crop production and nutrient use mon et al 2016 and the efficiency is relatively low due to nitrogen loss wang et al 2014 sinclair and rufty 2012 reported that a key parameter for increasing yield may be to increase nitrogen uptake later in the growth cycle and increasing the total nitrogen storage pool appears to be essential for gaining further yield increases micro sprinkling irrigation can realize the postponed application of nitrogen by integrating water and fertilizer application however there is insufficient research on the effects of integrating water and fertilizer application under micro sprinkling irrigation with different nitrogen fertilizer rates in winter wheat in this study we hypothesized that the optimized micro sprinkling irrigation scheduling with suitable nitrogen fertilizer rate in winter wheat can ensure water and nitrogen supply during grain filling in the upper soil layer reduce the risk of soil nitrate leaching into deeper soil layers and delay the senescence of leaves increase the dry matter production during grain filling and improve grain weight and finally improve the grain yield and the use efficiency of water and nitrogen by postponing the application of water and nitrogen fertilizer to test this hypothesis a four year experiment with different micro sprinkling frequencies and nitrogen rates was conducted and the leaf area index lai the chlorophyll content of flag leaf after anthesis the dry matter and nitrogen accumulation yield and yield components and the utilization of water and nitrogen were investigated under the integrated water and nitrogen micro sprinkling irrigation 2

and n3 equivalent to total nitrogen amounts of 150 195 and 225 kg n ha 1 respectively were applied with 105 kg n ha 1 as the base fertilizer and the rest as top dressing three replicates for each treatment and a plot size of 4 m 30 m the traditional flood irrigation was used as the control ck irrigation 60 mm at jointing and anthesis stage respectively table 1 presents the details of the treatments the micro sprinkling system included water and fertilizer integration technology the high yield wheat triticum aestivum l cultivar jimai22 was used in the experiments which is one of the most important and widely planted crops in hebei province wheat seeds were sown on 15 october with a row spacing of 15 cm the micro sprinkling hose design and details of the orifice arrangement have been described by man et al 2014b the micro sprinkling hoses were 30 m long with a flow rate of 6 0 m3 h 1 and the sprinkling angle of the micro sprinkling hose was 80 each experimental plot consisted of 24 rows of wheat spaced 15 cm apart the inter row spaces between wheat rows were named l1 to l23 the micro sprinkling hose was laid between l6 and l18 respectively i e the sprinkled range of each side of every micro sprinkling hose is one meter fig 2 well water was used as the water source before sowing 105 kg n ha 1 150 p2o5 kg ha 1 and 90 kg k2o ha 1 were applied as base fertilizer for each micro sprinkling irrigation application urea as top dressing was completely dissolved in a fertilization device fig 2 and applied together with irrigation water while in the flood irrigation treatment urea was spread over the fields before irrigation at the jointing stage 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 crop phenology crop phenology was recorded using the zadoks scale zadoks et al 1974 following the average phenology of the plot when 50 of shoots reached at main developmental stage the corresponding dates were recorded when the 1st node was detectable jointing z31 50 of spikes have extruded at least one anther beginning of anthesis z61 and the grain is difficult to divide by thumbnail maturity z91 2 3 2 leaf area index of the population and chlorophyll content of flag leaf at anthesis and the grain filling stage 20 days after anthesis the green leaf area was measured by a li 3100 area meter li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa and calculated green leaf area index lai for the chlorophyll content analysis 20 flag leaf samples were randomly collected at five day intervals starting from the first day of anthesis to maturity i e on 0 5 15 20 25 and 30 days after anthesis fresh samples were stored at 25 c until the biochemical assays were performed the flag leaf chlorophyll a b content was extracted with 95 alcohol and measured with a spectrophotometer 2 3 3 dry matter accumulation and grain yield the aboveground parts of all plants from two 50 cm sites avoiding border rows in each plot were sampled at jointing anthesis and maturity and were oven dried at 75 c until reaching a constant weight after which the biomass was measured dry matter translocation dmt from the vegetative portions to the grain between anthesis and maturity was calculated following the methods of hu et al 2007 and shi et al 2016 dmt was calculated as the difference between dry matter accumulation dma at anthesis and dma at maturity without grain weight dma during grain filling was calculated as the difference between grain weight at maturity and dmt the contribution of dry matter during grain filling to grain weight was calculated from the ratio of dma during grain filling to grain weight at maturity the harvest index hi is the ratio of grain yield to total aboveground dry matter accumulation at maturity xue et al 2014 to determine the grain yield spikes were counted in six 1 m central rows of each plot before harvest the grain number per spike was determined by counting the kernels in each spike from 60 randomly selected plants in each plot before harvesting at maturity wheat plants from a 3 m2 area in each plot were harvested and threshed for the grain yield determination the actual grain yield was reported on a 13 moisture basis the 1000 grain weight tgw was calculated by weighing 1000 seeds from each sample and averaged from three replicates 2 3 4 soil water consumption and water use efficiency the soil water content was measured at sowing jointing

the ratio of the water consumption amount of that stage ca to the total et the wue for grain yield was calculated as follows xue et al 2014 wue gy et where gy kg ha 1 is grain yield and et mm is the total seasonal crop et during the period of wheat growth 2 3 5 nitrogen absorption and utilization the total nitrogen content in plants was determined using the kjeldahl method dordas and sioulas 2009 nitrogen accumulation and use were calculated as follows according to ruisi et al 2016 total n accumulation nt dm nc grain n accumulation ng gy nc nfue gy nf ncr na nm ng 100 nhi ng nt where dm is the

accumulation were analyzed according to the analysis of variance using glm in spss ver 17 0 spss inc chicago il usa differences were judged by the least significant differences test using a 0 05 level of significance 3 results 3 1 grain yield and yield components in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 growth seasons the grain yield was significantly influenced by year type y irrigation schedules i and the interaction between year and irrigation schedules y i table 2 as shown in table 3 there were no significant differences in spike number and kernel number per spike among ck s2 s3 and s4 treatments in the 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 growing seasons however the grain yield and tgw increased significantly as the micro sprinkling frequency increased from two times s2 to four times s4 whereas the difference in yield between s3 and s4 was non significant as was the difference between ck and s2 compared with the ck the tgw and grain yield of s4 increased by 7 6 9 4 and 5 7 22 2 in the two years respectively and the higher increase occurred in 2013 2014 growing season which may be due to the higher rainfall in grain filling stage of may in 2013 2014 than in 2012 2013 fig 1 although the total rainfall was lower in 2013 2014 137 1 mm than in 2012 2013 161 3 mm in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 growing seasons the grain yield was significantly influenced by year type y nitrogen rate n table 2 the grain yield of s4n2 was significantly higher than that of the ck in both years and the grain yields of s4n1 and s4n3 were similar to the ck in 2014 2015 while they were significantly higher than the ck in 2015 2016 table 3 the tgw first increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen level however all tgws in the micro sprinkling irrigation treatments were higher than that in the ck therefore the increase in the grain yield of the micro sprinkling treatments was mainly due to the increase in the tgw in addition the grain yield in 2014 2015 was significantly higher than in 2015 2016 for all the treatments which may be due to the higher rainfall in april and total growing season of 2014 2015 than in 2015 2016 fig 1 thus obtaining the higher spike number in 2014 2015 growing season in this study with increasing micro sprinkling irrigation frequency the hi improved significantly in 2012 2014 in 2014 2016 under the micro sprinkling irrigation with different nitrogen application levels s4n2 yielded the highest hi 3 2 lai at different growth stages and flag leaf chlorophyll content during grain filling the lai at key crop growth stages is very important to yield in 2013 2014 there was no significant difference in the lai at anthesis between ck and s2 but they were significantly higher than those of s3 and s4 at the filling stage s3 and s4 had significantly higher lais than ck and s2 where s4 had the highest value fig 3 in 2014 2015 there was no significant difference in the lai between ck and s4n3 at anthesis but they were significantly higher than those of s4n1 and s4n2 at the filling stage the lais of s4n2 and s4n3 were significantly higher than those of ck and s4n1 however there was no significant difference between s4n2 and s4n3 in short increasing the micro sprinkling frequency with appropriate nitrogen application can support higher lais at the filling stage flag leaf senescence after anthesis was investigated every five days in 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 the chlorophyll content of the flag leaf after anthesis first increased and then decreased in all treatments in both years in 2013 2014 s2 showed similar changes as the ck whereas s3 and s4 showed significantly postponed declines in the flag leaf chlorophyll content days after anthesis 15th daa 15 which was more obvious in s4 fig 4 in 2014 2015 the micro sprinkling irrigation treatments all showed significantly postponed flag leaf senescence days after anthesis 15th daa 15 where s4n2 and s4n3 showed more significant effects than s4n1 however there was no significant difference between s4n2 and s4n3 before daa 15 and the flag leaves chlorophyll content of s4n3 was significantly higher than that of s4n2 after daa 20 the higher leaf chlorophyll content of s4n3 during the later grain filling maybe result in the leaves remaining green and delaying crop maturity than others treatments which is the reason for higher nitrogen application decreased grain weight and yield table 3 overall micro sprinkling irrigation with more frequent applications of smaller amounts of water and proper nitrogen fertilization can postpone flag leaf senescence and maintain photosynthesis in leaves 3 3 dry matter accumulation the dry matter accumulation in different stages of wheat varied among the treatments fig 5 in 2013 2014 there was no significant difference in dry matter accumulation at maturity dmm between ck and s2 but s4 had a significantly higher dry matter accumulation than s2 s3 and ck micro sprinkling more frequently s3 and s4 increased the dry matter accumulation during the grain filling and decreased the dry matter accumulation at seeding jointing and jointing anthesis compared with the ck in 2014 2015 s4n2 and s4n3 significantly increased the dmm compared with the ck while s4n1 had a lower dmm than the ck all micro sprinkling treatments showed increased dry matter accumulation during the grain filling where s4n2 was significantly higher than s4n1 and s4n3 overall the results for the two years showed that increasing the micro sprinkling frequency with proper nitrogen application increased the dmm and the dry matter accumulation during the grain filling the contribution of dry matter accumulation after anthesis to grain yield improved significantly with increasing micro sprinkling irrigation frequency however there was no significant difference between s3 and s4 fig 6 when micro sprinkling irrigation with water was conducted four times the different nitrogen application treatments also improved the contribution of dry matter accumulation after anthesis to grain yield compared with the ck s4n2 and s4n3 improved the contribution rate of dry accumulation after anthesis to grain yield by 31 3 and 17 8 respectively 3 4 soil nitrogen use 3 4 1 population nitrogen accumulation and nitrogen use efficiency nitrogen accumulation and the allocation proportion ap at different stages showed similar changes in the 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 growing seasons table 4 the total nitrogen accumulation was higher in the micro sprinkling treatments than in the ck and the highest one occurred in s4n2 based on the nitrogen accumulation amount na there was no significant difference from seeding to jointing between the ck and micro sprinkling treatments however the nitrogen ap of the ck was significantly higher than that of the micro sprinkling treatments in both years from jointing to anthesis the na and ap of s4n1 were lower than that of the ck while s4n2 and s4n3 had higher values than the ck in 2014 2015 the ap of all micro sprinkling treatments was lower than the ck in 2015 2016 however the na and ap after anthesis in all micro sprinkling treatments were higher than the ck in both years the grain nitrogen accumulation amount followed the order s4n2 s4n3 s4n1 ck in both years compared with the ck the nhi did not improve under the micro sprinkling treatments but rather decreased in s4n3 all nitrogen application levels under micro sprinkling irrigation showed improved contribution rates of nitrogen accumulation during grain filling in plants to the grain nitrogen accumulation at maturity and there was no significant difference in the nitrogen accumulation at maturity between s4n1 and s4n2 in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 compared with the ck s4n1 s4n2 and s4n3 showed increased nitrogen accumulations at maturity that were 53 9 127 9 62 5 123 0 and 27 9 101 5 higher than ck in both years respectively the nitrogen fertilizer production efficiency nfue of s4n2 was significantly higher than that of the ck in both years while s4n1 and s4n3 had similar nfue values to the ck in 2014 2015 and significantly higher nfue values than the ck in 2015 2016 table 4 the highest nfue was recorded for s4n2 in both years and the higher nitrogen application level s4n3 resulted in a lower nfue 3 4 2 temporal and spatial variation of soil no3 n content soil no3 n content snc in the 200 cm soil depth of all treatments decreased first and then increased with increasing soil layer fig 7 it gradually decreased from anthesis to maturity due to the large amount of soil nitrogen was absorbed by the plants at the anthesis stage in the 2014 2015 growing season due to more precipitation at booting anthesis in 0 20 cm soil layer no significant difference was observed between ck and s4n3 and it was significantly decreased in s4n2 and s4n1 the snc in s4n1 was the lowest in 20 40 cm soil layer besides s4n1 s4n2 and s4n3 was higher than ck from 40 to 160 cm soil layer due to n leaching the snc of ck was significantly higher than micro sprinkling irrigation treatments in 2015 2016 in 0 40 cm soil layer the snc of micro sprinkling irrigation was significantly higher than that of ck which was mainly due to the n application in the micro irrigation treatments at the booting stage and it was increased with the increase of nitrogen application amount in the upper soil profile below 60 cm soil layer the snc of ck was significantly higher than that of micro sprinkling and s4n3 was higher than s4n2 and s4n1 at filling and maturity the snc of ck in the upper soil layers continued to decrease while micro sprinkling irrigation maintained a relatively high content and micro sprinkling promoted the absorption of nitrogen in the deep soil layer because the snc in the deep soil layer was significantly lower in the micro irrigation treatments than in ck at maturity particularly in s4n1 in conclusion compared with ck the micro sprinkling irrigation treatments ensured the nitrogen supply in the upper soil profile 0 40 cm during the grain filling and the soil water content was lower than ck in 60 80 cm soil profile and it may reduce the movement of no3 n to the deeper soil layer increase absorption and utilization of stored nitrogen in the deeper soil and reduce the risk of no3 n leaching into deep soil 3 5 soil water use 3 5 1 seasonal evapotranspiration and water use efficiency in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 growing seasons the total evapotranspiration et was significantly influenced by year type y irrigation schedules i and the interaction between year and irrigation schedules y i table 2 in 2012 2013 s2 and s3 had similar et levels as the ck while s4 had lower et than the ck fig 8 in 2013 2014 s2 had a similar et as the ck while s3 and s4 had lower et levels than the ck in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 growing seasons the season et was significantly influenced by year type y nitrogen application rate n but the interaction between y and n was no significant difference y n table 2 as shown in fig 8 all of the micro sprinkling irrigation treatments had lower et levels than the ck which first increased and then decreased as nitrogen rate increased the decrease in et was mainly due to the decrease in soil water consumption because the total irrigation amount and precipitation were the same for the different treatments in each year regarding water consumption in each stage there was no significant difference in the water consumption amount ca daily water consumption cd and water consumption percentage cp among the treatments from sowing to jointing in 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 table 5 increasing the micro sprinkling frequency decreased the ca cd and cp from jointing to anthesis but increased the ca cd and cp from anthesis to maturity in 2013 2014 and the highest ca cd and cp values post anthesis were observed for s4 followed by s3 s2 and ck in 2014 2015 all of the micro sprinkling treatments had lower ca cd and cp values from jointing to anthesis and had higher ca cd and cp values from anthesis to maturity compared with the ck and the highest water consumption from jointing to anthesis was obtained in s4n3 followed by s4n2 and s4n1 the highest water consumption from anthesis to maturity was obtained in s4n1 and s4n2 followed by s4n3 the water use efficiency wue was significantly influenced by irrigation schedules nitrogen rate and the interaction between year and irrigation schedules table 2 compared with the ck micro sprinkling more frequently s4 significantly increased the wue in all four years fig 8 in 2012 2013 there was no significant difference in the wue between the ck and s2 meanwhile in 2013 2014 s2 had a higher wue than the ck but there was no significant difference between s3 and s4 although s4 had a higher wue in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 all micro sprinkling treatments had higher wue than the ck and with increasing nitrogen application the wue first increased and then decreased the highest wue was obtained at s4n2 in brief the results of the four year experiment showed that due to a significant increase in grain yield and decrease in et s4 or s4n2 increased the wue by 19 3 compared with the ck 3 5 2 temporal and spatial variation of soil water content in this study the difference in soil water content swc was significant at the same growth stage among the different treatments and they all decreased first and then increased with an increase in soil depth fig 9 in 2013 2014 growing season there was no significant difference in the swc in 0 200 cm between ck and s2 at anthesis filling and maturity stages however at anthesis the swc of s4 in the 0 40 cm soil depth was significantly higher than that of other treatments and s3 was the lowest which may have been due to irrigation with 30 mm of water in s4 at the booting stage while there was no irrigation in ck and s2 especially in s3 which only irrigation with 45 mm of water at jointing stage in 60 120 cm soil depth the swc of ck and s2 were significantly higher than that of s4 and s3 and s3 was the lowest whereas there was little difference below the 140 cm soil layer at the filling stage the swc of ck and s2 in the 0 100 cm soil layer were higher than that of s3 and s4 and s4 was the lowest no significant difference was observed below the 120 140 cm soil layer among treatments while the swc of s3 and s4 was lower than that of ck and s2 the higher swc of ck and s2 in the upper soil profile may have been due to more irrigation at anthesis and the smaller water supply of s3 and s4 at booing and anthesis stages may promote the absorption and use of deeper soil moisture at maturity the swc of s3 and s4 in the upper soil profile was higher than that of s2 and ck but slightly lower than ck and s2 in the deeper soil profile in 2014 2015 growing season the regularity of swc with s4 was basically coincident to the previous year however water consumption was reduced by increasing or decreasing nitrogen application overall compared with ck and s2 the s4 treatments ensured upper swc at the critical growth stages and promoted utilization of water in the deep soil profile during grain filling 4 discussion micro sprinkling is an advanced irrigation method applied to field crop that is considered to be more efficient than traditional flood irrigation liu et al 2011 man et al 2014a 2014b 2017 in this study the results of a four year experiment showed that under the quota irrigation conditions micro sprinkling with a suitable amount of nitrogen at the jointing booting anthesis and filling stages i e treatment s4 increased the grain yield wue and nfue there were some differences in the grain yield wue and nfue of s4 n2 among the years but overall this treatment showed the best results of all treatments in the four years compared with the ck all s4 n2 treatments exceeded 8900 kg ha 1 and the yield increased by 5 7 22 2 the wue increased by 10 0 27 8 and the nfue increased by 10 4 16 8 4 1 the dry matter production during grain filling and crop yield the grain yield of wheat is separated into three components spike number grain number per spike and grain weight increases in wheat yield have been achieved by increasing the grain number bustos et al 2013 while grain weight has not changed substantially austin et al 1980 waddington et al 1986 further increases in yield are possible by increasing the grain weight bustos et al 2013 liang et al 2017 the grain filling stage is the critical period for grain weight and yield formation and increase post anthesis dry matter production is an important means to increase wheat grain yield shi et al 2016 in our four year study micro sprinkling treatment with smaller amounts of water more frequently i e treatment s4 had little influence on spike number and kernels per spike but significantly increased the grain weight table 3 which was the main cause of the higher grain yield in s4 plaut et al 2004 reported that grain filling in wheat is affected by the current photosynthates produced in leaves and stems and the mobilization of stored carbohydrates within these organs micro sprinkling with smaller amounts of water more frequently delayed flag leaf senescence fig 4 and yielded a higher lai at the grain filling stage fig 3 which promoted the production of dry matter accumulation during grain filling period fig 5 increased the grain weight and increased the contribution of dry matter post anthesis to grain yield fig 6 this is in agreement with previous studies that have found that increases in crop yield due to optimized irrigation results from higher biomass accumulation during the grain filling stage gao et al 2017 4 2 irrigation scheduling and water use efficiency wue the timing and amount of irrigation are two critical factors for improving the wue under limited water supply conditions wang 2017 wang et al 2004 reported that a suitable water supply after anthesis could increase the grain yield improve grain quality and increase the wue moreover crop et was estimated from irrigation precipitation and soil water depletion and was affected by irrigation regimes dar et al 2017 micro sprinkling irrigation enables more frequent applications of smaller amounts of water and it has been reported that micro sprinkling irrigation improves the uniformity of irrigation and increases the wue man et al 2014b in this four year study the s4 n2 treatment had a higher grain yield and lower et than the ck i e traditional flood irrigation table 3 which resulted in a higher wue in s4 n2 fig 8 what s more under the s4 condition swc in the upper soil profile was higher than in ck during the grain filling period whereas it was slightly lower than ck in the deeper soil layer which showed that s4 ensured the upper swc at grain filling period and promoted the utilization of water in the deep soil layer fig 9 this was also beneficial to increase wue in addition under the optional micro sprinkling irrigation condition s4n2 the dry matter accumulation was significantly lower during jointing anthesis and significantly enhanced during anthesis maturity table 5 the water and nitrogen fertilizer supply after anthesis ensured the dry matter production during grain filling stage figs 5 and 9 which was another reason that s4 n2 resulted in a higher grain yield and wue 4 3 nitrogen fertilizer application and nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency nfue nitrogen fertilizer is important for increasing crop yields however researches have showed that over fertilization can reduce crop yield and fertilizer use efficiency song et al 2009 hao et al 2014 traditional fertilizer application often involves one application of too much fertilizer resulting in the volatilization leaching and decomposition of nitrogen leading to a lower nfue pollution of groundwater and negative effects on the environment gheysari et al 2009 li et al 2018 micro sprinkling irrigation can realize the use of smaller amounts of water and fertilizer with more frequent applications and nitrogen fertilizer can be applied at critical growth periods the present study showed that integrating water and nitrogen application with micro sprinkling could postpone nitrogen application s4n2 which ensured which ensured the soil n distribution in the upper soil profile and increased nitrogen absorption during grain filling fig 7 thus increasing the chlorophyll content and delaying flag leaf senescence figs 3 and 4 and its beneficial to guarantee photosynthetic production after anthesis and increases the grain yield and nitrogen fertilizer utilization efficiency table 3 and 4 similarly guo et al 2006 found that nitrogen application at a later growing stage in spring wheat guaranteed the leaf function and increased the grain weight however the higher leaf chlorophyll content of s4n3 during the later grain filling maybe result in the leaves remaining green and delaying crop maturity than others treatments fig 4 which is the reason for higher nitrogen application decreased grain weight and yield in addition due to the postponement of water and nitrogen application the lower nitrogen rate treatment s4n1 resulted in a comparable or higher grain yield and nfue than the ck while the same nitrogen rate treatment s4n2 as the ck had a significantly higher grain yield and nfue further increasing the nitrogen rate s4n3 decreased grain yield and nfue tables 3 and 4 in brief the highest yield and nfue as well as nitrogen accumulation amount and percentage during the grain filling period and its contribution to grain nitrogen were achieved by applying smaller amounts of water more frequently with micro sprinkling and an appropriate amount of nitrogen 195 kg ha 1 overall the results of the four year experiment indicated that micro sprinkling with smaller amounts of water more frequently and appropriate nitrogen application can realize high grain yield and high resource use efficiency however further studies are required to clarify the mechanism of the high yield and high resource use efficiency for the integration of water and fertilizer with micro sprinkling and the root distribution as well as changes in the micro environment of the winter wheat canopy 5 conclusions optimal micro sprinkling irrigation scheduling s4n2 significantly increased the grain yield wue and nfue of winter wheat by 5 7 22 2 10 0 27 8 and 10 4 16 8 respectively compared with traditional irrigation the higher yield in the s4 n2 treatment was due to the increase in the absorption of water and nitrogen after anthesis which delayed leaf senescence increased dry matter accumulation during grain filling and increased the tgw overall under the proper application of nitrogen micro sprinkling with smaller amounts of water more frequently and fertilizer integration is promising as a highly efficient water and fertilizer management method in the ncp acknowledgements we are
