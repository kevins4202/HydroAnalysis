15730,recovery of phosphorus from wastewater through struvite crystallization is one of the most attractive methods however the cost of chemical consumption makes this technology is unattractive to some extent in this work highly active serpentine was prepared by one step mechanical activation and then used to recover phosphate as struvite from the black water containing 132 8 mg l phosphorus and 3144 mg l ammonia nitrogen the results indicated that the prepared active serpentine can release magnesium ions and hydroxide ions simultaneously into an aqueous solution and is an ideal raw material for struvite crystallization the factors for phosphorus recovery in this process mainly include mechanical activation intensity serpentine dosage and contact time for the actual black water a high recovery rate of phosphorus 98 is achieved by using active serpentine as the magnesium and alkali source for struvite precipitation the recovery product was identified as struvite with a median particle size of 32 96 μm it was confirmed that the mechanical activation damaged the crystal structure of the raw serpentine improving the activity of mg2 and oh the undissolved si containing particles act as crystal seeds accelerating the struvite crystallization process furthermore a pilot scale test was conducted with a rural public toilet in xiong an new district hebei province the results showed that an acceptable phosphorus recovery 98 could be achieved using active serpentine additionally it was demonstrated that the serpentine process to recover phosphate as struvite reduced the cost by 54 4 in compared with an ordinary chemical process the active serpentine is a promising dual source of magnesium and alkali for the phosphorus recovery by the struvite method it has a potential prospect for the large scale application in phosphorus recovery and struvite fertilizer production graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphorus recovery active serpentine struvite economics mechanical activation black water 1 introduction in rural areas and developing countries the household wastewater contributes considerably to the pollutants load in the local domestic sewage the centralized treatment is not the optimal solution in rural areas due to the cost of large scale sewage collection as such source diversion of household wastewater with advantages of energy saving and nutrient recycling has attracted the attention of many researchers kujawa roeleveld et al 2006 yu et al 2020 in the source diversion process black water toilet wastewater and grey water i e laundry hand washing shower are collected separately bringing new possibilities for decentralized wastewater treatment gao et al 2020 gao et al 2019 black water containing urine and feces contributes 80 phosphorus p and 90 nitrogen n in domestic wastewater solanki and boyer 2019 todt et al 2015 direct discharge of domestic wastewater in the environment will bring excess nitrogen and phosphorus to regional water bodies and cause a great threat to the ecological environment du et al 2020 thus the removal of phosphorus and nitrogen from domestic wastewater is necessary for compliant discharge it can be inferred that removing nitrogen and phosphorus from black water in advance will greatly reduce the pollution of domestic wastewater additionally phosphorus is a non renewable nutrient and its recycling and reuse have attracted extensive attention from scientific researchers carrillo et al 2020 cordell et al 2009 mayer et al 2016 it was reported that the recovery of phosphorus from waste streams could not only reduce phosphorus pollution but also reduce dependency on imported mineral phosphate in countries with limited access to affordable fertilizers cid et al 2018 the concentration of phosphorus in black water is dozens of times higher than that in domestic wastewater it is more rational to recover phosphorus from black water than from domestic wastewater therefore the recovery of phosphorus from black water should be valued zhou et al 2021 at present the black water was generally ignored in the recycling of water and discharged directly into centralized treatment systems or even rivers and lakes etc prado et al 2020 therefore the development of easy to operate and economical technology to recover phosphorus from black water is significant to the environment and water resources recovery in rural and developing regions phosphate recovery can be achieved by a variety of methods such as struvite crystallization shaddel et al 2020 adsorption saifuddin et al 2019 ion exchange kilpimaa et al 2015 electrochemical processes lei et al 2021 li et al 2021 etc the struvite crystallization has the advantage that phosphate po4 p and ammonium nh4 n are removed simultaneously and the recovered struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o can potentially be used directly as a slow release fertilizer thus the struvite crystallization is considered as a promising way for recovering po4 p from waste streams xia et al 2016 although the struvite process has been investigated by many researchers the challenges of the process to full scale application still exist especially in terms of cost and process operation the usage of pure chemical agents puts pressure on the economic feasibility of the struvite method shaddel et al 2020 previous documents have demonstrated that the crystallization of struvite requires sufficient mg2 po4 3 nh4 and base ph 8 11 in solution li et al 2019 however the absence of magnesium ions and bases in wastewater is a common phenomenon le corre et al 2009 for example de graaff et al 2011 investigated the recovery of p from anaerobically digested black water via struvite crystallization in their work naoh and mgcl2 were used as base and magnesium sources respectively however the chemical reagents lead to a high cost and a decline in the economic attractiveness of the struvite process merino jimenez et al 2017 therefore the exploitation of affordable magnesium and base is crucial to the struvite process until now some alternative magnesium sources such as magnesite al mallahi et al 2020 gunay et al 2008 magnesium electrolytic plate kekedy nagy et al 2020 seawater lahav et al 2013 shaddel et al 2020 bittern solution ye et al 2011 wood ash sakthivel et al 2012 and magnesium oxide quintana et al 2004 have been developed to reduce the raw material cost for struvite crystallization however a material that can simultaneously provide magnesium and base for struvite crystallization has not been reported recently mineral materials are increasingly attractive for water treatment due to the advantages of low cost and convenient kausar et al 2018 yang et al 2018 serpentine mg3si2o5 oh 4 is a common clay mineral with an abundance of oh functional groups 27 86 wt and mg ions 29 50 wt therefore serpentine is a potential source of magnesium and base for the struvite process our previous studies have demonstrated that mechanical activation can increase the activity of serpentine and enhance the dissolution of hydroxide and magnesium ions huang et al 2017 however the feasibility of using mechanically activated serpentine as a source of magnesium and base for struvite crystallization has not been confirmed herein the recovery of phosphate from wastewater by mechanically activated serpentine was proposed the motivation of this work is to determine whether struvite can be obtained from wastewater by using active serpentine and develop an economical and feasible technology for recovering phosphorus by struvite crystallization in this work the black water from a public toilet was pretreated by solid liquid separation to remove suspended solids and then was used for phosphorus recovery the nature serpentine was activated by a high energy planetary mill and added into the black water to recover phosphate the effect of mechanical activation on the serpentine was investigated to confirm the feasibility of active serpentine to release mg2 and oh by itself in solution then the performance of phosphate recovery was studied the recovered product was analyzed in detail the reaction mechanism was proposed based on laboratory results a movable pilot scale unit was designed and manufactured to treat the black water which confirmed the prospects of full scale application of the technology additionally the economic benefit analysis was carried out based on the optimal pilot test conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the massive serpentine ore was obtained from a mine in jiangsu province china the serpentine ore was crushed by a jaw crusher and sieved with a 0 45 mm steel screen fig s1 lizardite mg3si2o5 oh 4 pdf 01 086 0403

hydroxide naoh and sulfuric acid h2so4 were purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd shanghai china the synthetic wastewater to be processed was made up of ultrapure water and chemical agents the ultrapure water used in this work was taken from milli q direct 8 16 18 2 mω cm the black water was collected from a public toilet in a rural village in xiong an new district hebei province china a spiral sludge dewatering machine was applied to roughly separate the feces in the black water and the filtrate obtained was as the starting solution to be processed the black water sample was stored at 4 c in a low temperature refrigerator the concentration of po4 p and nh4 n in the black water was measured to be 132 8 mg l and 3144 mg l respectively the ph of the black water was 7 3 2 2 batch experiments activating operation a high energy ball mill p 7 fritsch germany was employed to prepare active serpentine three grams of the serpentine powder were put into a zirconia jar with a capacity of 45 ml and 7 zirconia balls with a diameter of 15 mm were placed in the jar the running time of the ball mill was controlled at 15 30 60 90 and 120 min to prepare samples with different activation intensities the grinding speed was fixed at 500 rpm the prepared samples were stored in sealed bags for later use water leaching 80 mg of the active serpentine was added into a beaker containing 100 ml ultrapure water and stirred for 60 min at 300 rpm after leaching the equilibrium ph was measured by a ph meter a 5 ml water sample was taken from the beaker and filtered through a millipore filter with a pore size of 0 22 μm to measure the concentration of magnesium ions po4 p recovery 100 mg of the raw serpentine powder was added into 100 ml black water and stirred by a magnetic rotor at 300 rpm for 30 min then 5 ml aqueous solution was taken out and filtered by 0 22 μm millipore filter after standing for 30 min the precipitate was obtained by solid liquid separation with vacuum filtration the obtained precipitate was dried in an oven at 40 for 12 h the active serpentine with different activation intensities was used then the dosage of active serpentine was selected as 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 g l to treat the black water additionally the contact time was changed to 5 15 30 60 and 90 min while fixing other factors each of the above experiment was repeated three times pilot scale test a movable device was designed and manufactured as shown in fig s3 the volume of the mixed reaction tank of the device is 600 l which is the same as the volume of settlement overflow tank the total power of the equipment is 1 11 kw the pilot scale activated serpentine was produced by a planetary mill equipped with 4 grinding jars 4 25 l which can produce 30 kg of active serpentine at a time the power of the ball mill was 11kw the activation time was controlled at 90 min the schematic diagram of the device is shown in fig 1 the black water is pumped into the reaction tank and then mixed with the active serpentine after the reaction the solution enters the sedimentation overflow tank the precipitate is recovered at the bottom and the supernatant overflows into drain pipe the reaction time was fixed at 60 min and the dosage of the active serpentine was adjusted to be 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 kg t common chemical process the agent of mgso4 6h2o was added into

of naoh and mgso4 6h2o was recorded 2 3 characterization the concentration of mg2 was determined by an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer optima 8300 usa the concentration of p and n was determined by a uv spectrophotometer hach dr 2800 according to colorimetry gb 11893 89 and gb 7479 87 the phase of the sample was identified by an x ray diffractometer xrd xpert pro mpd with a cu kα x

granularity of samples the infrared spectrum characteristics of samples were measured by using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer thermo scientific nicolet is5 the recovery rate of po4 p was calculated by eq 1 1 r c 0 c 1 c 0 100 in the formula r is the recovery rate c 0 represents the initial concentration of po4 p in solution and c 1 represents the residual concentration of po4 p after the reaction at given time 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of mechanical activation on the serpentine the feasibility of simultaneous supply of mg2 and base by the active serpentine was investigated by water leaching tests firstly as shown in fig 2 a the concentration of mg2 is only 4 35 mg l without activation with the extension of the activation the concentration of mg2 increases from 8 91 mg l at 15min to 19 38 mg l at 120 min fig 2b shows that the ph increased from 8 5 at 0 min to 11 2 at 120 min it is demonstrated that the mechanical activation can enhance the dissolution of serpentine which can provide mg2 and base spontaneously in aqueous solution the effect of the activation process on the crystal structure of serpentine is shown in fig 2c the phases of serpentine pdf 01 086 0403 mg3si2o3 oh 4 and brucite pdf 01 076 0667 mg oh 2 are determined in the raw material the raw material has sharp x ray diffraction peaks indicating that the mineral is well crystallized however when mechanical activation was applied to the serpentine ore the x ray diffraction peak intensity of the sample begins to decrease the higher the activation intensity the weaker the diffraction peak intensity and the longer the half height width of the diffraction peak it can be inferred that the unit cell of the mineral particles is destroyed by the action of mechanical activation also it indicates that the ionic bonds in the serpentine structural unit are broken by the milling process the rupture of ionic bonds is conducive to the dissolution of mg2 and oh from solid particles into aqueous solution which was coincided with the results of fig 2a additionally the change of chemical bond on the surface of solid particles was studied by the infrared spectrometer as shown in fig 2d for the raw martial the sharp peak at 3690 cm 1 was attributed to oh mg oh stretching vibration which is a unique and distinguishing characteristic of the serpentine group with the increase of activation time the absorption peak of 3690 cm 1 becomes weaker and weaker indicating that more and more oh mg oh groups are broken the peaks at 3445 and 1635 cm 1 are related to the stretching and bending modes of h2o the peaks of 1081 and 957 cm 1 are corresponded to si o si apical stretching vibration and si o si basal stretching vibration respectively the peaks of 610 and 442 cm 1 are both due to mg oh bending vibration lu et al 2019 after 120 min of mechanical activation the absorption peaks of 1081 and 610 cm 1 almost disappear indicating that the o si o and mg oh groups on the serpentine particle surface are reduced by the process additionally the peak position of the basal stretching vibration of si o si moves from 957 to 992 cm 1 indicating that the bond energy of si o si is weakened by the activation the morphological characteristic of the serpentine ore with different activation time is shown in fig 3 the raw serpentine particles have irregular contours and the diameters are in the range of 10 30 μm fig 3a b with 30 min of activation the particle diameter is significantly reduced fig 3c when the activation time exceeds 30 min the particle diameter no longer changes significantly fig 3d f fig s4 shows the median diameter of the serpentine powder at different activation time the median diameter d50 represents the particle size at which the particle mass is divided into two equal halves the d50 of the raw serpentine powder is 35 32 μm after being milled for15 min the d50 decreases to 11 81 μm with a prolongation of activation time from 30 to 120 min the d50 becomes stable at around 10 μm it was found that the activation operation can reduce particle size quickly however crushing agglomeration and reorganization may coexist during the milling process thus the particle size did not always decrease with the extension of the activation time instead the crystal structure of the particles has changed irreversibly as shown fig 2c in short the mechanical activation can significantly change the crystal structure and chemical bonds of the serpentine increasing the water solubility of serpentine thus the active serpentine has the potential to be used as a source of magnesium and base 3 2 performance of po4 p removal from the black water by active serpentine the effect of operational factors on the recovery of po4 p was investigated the influence of activation intensity is shown in fig 4 a without activation 0 min the recovery rate of po4 p is only 19 31 as the extension of activation time the recovery rate of po4 p increases to 64 17 and 93 56 at 30 min and 120 min respectively considering energy cost we recommended an activation time of 90 min in this work the effect of dosage is shown in fig 4b it can be seen that the recovery rate of po4 p increases with the dosage of active serpentine the recovery rate is 98 08 when the dosage is 1 5 g l as the dosage is increased to be 2 0 g l the recovery rate is 98 60 the contact time is critical to the performance of po4 p recovery thus the effect of contact time was investigated by fixing activation time and dosage from fig 4c it can be seen that the recovery rate of po4 p increases from 72 05 at 5 min to 98 08 at 30 min and then remains constant within 30 90 min it indicates that 30 60 min of contact time is suitable the concentration of residual mg2 in filtrate and the corresponding ph were investigated as shown in fig 4d f the overall trend of mg2 concentration and the ph are positively correlated with variables with sufficient activation time dosage and contact time the serpentine powder can supply magnesium ions and base for recovering phosphorus from black water in order to investigate the kinetic of po4 p recovery by the active serpentine process the relation between recovery and contact time was studied by adjusting the serpentine dosage as shown in fig 5 a the recovery rate of po4 p increases with the contact time extension from 5 to 60 min after that the recovery rate of po4 p begins to decrease slightly it can be inferred that with the extension of the reaction time the precipitates may undergo secondary dissolution thereby reducing the recovery rate of po4 p as such a reaction time fewer than 60 min was proposed here it can be seen from fig 5b that the recovery capability increases firstly and then decreases with the increase of po4 p concentration the maximum recovery capacity is about 159 37 mg p g however as the concentration of po4 p increases to 10 mm the recovery capacity decreases to 118 5 mg p g the decrease in recovery capability was most likely due to the decrease in ph as shown in fig 5b the equilibrium ph of the reaction system decreases with the increase of po4 p concentration it may be due to the buffering effect of phosphate and ammonium in the solution a suitable ph 9 10 was required for struvite crystallization and the decrease in ph was not beneficial to the recovery of po4 p this may explain why the recovery capacity of po4 p is decreased at a higher po4 p concentration 3 3 precipitate analysis to investigate the process of the po4 p removal the main components of the precipitates obtained from the treatment of the black water were analyzed by an x ray diffractometer fig 6 a shows the xrd patterns of the precipitates obtained by adding the active serpentine in the case of raw serpentine ore 0 min the main phases of the precipitate were determined as serpentine and brucite in addition a small number of struvite crystals appears in the precipitate as the increase of the activation intensity the intensity of the diffraction peak of struvite increased significantly it shows that the active serpentine could combine phosphate and ammonium in the solution to effectively transform into struvite the composition of the precipitate changed with the reaction time as shown in fig 6b it can be seen that after 15 min of reaction the struvite appears in the precipitate additionally the remaining serpentine was found in the white precipitate with the extension of the reaction time the intensity of struvite diffraction peaks increased fig 6c showed the ftir spectrum of the precipitate obtained at different reaction time the sharp peak at 3694 cm 1 was attributed to o h stretching vibration the peaks at 3448 and 1637 cm 1 were related to the stretching and bending modes of h2o the shark peak at 1000 cm 1 was due to the si o si basal stretching vibration while the peak of 463 cm 1 was due to mg oh bending vibration lu et al 2019 for the samples of 15 30 45 and 60 min a broad asymmetric band of 3800 cm 1 to 2200 cm 1 was observed which could be ascribed to oh and nh stretching vibration wei et al 2019 the peak of 1434 cm 1 was due to the antisymmetric bending ν4 of nh4 while those of 570 and 456 cm 1 were brought by the asymmetric bending ν4 and bending vibration ν2 of po4 3 respectively the peak at 760 cm 1 was attributed to the hydrogen bonding between h2o h2o liao et al 2020 shu et al 2019 overall the above analysis showed that the precipitate recovered in the process includes nh4 po4 3 h2o and mg similar to commercial struvite as such it is very likely that the po4 p was recovered as struvite by the treatment process the morphology and surface element characteristics of the precipitate recovered by the treatment process were investigated and the result is shown in fig 7 the morphology of the precipitate from the treatment by using raw serpentine powder is shown in fig 7a the precipitate is mainly composed of large irregularly shaped serpentine particles and there are a few small regular columnar particles which should be the produced struvite the precipitate from using the serpentine activated for 30 min is shown in fig 7b the volume of regular hexagonal columnar struvite particles occupies most of the volume of all particles and some other irregular particles were probably attributable to the remaining active serpentine as shown in fig 7c e most of the particles were in a regular column shape similar to the struvite particle shape reported by other documents shaddel et al 2020 the main elements on the surface of the precipitate from the treatment using the active serpentine were o mg p and n fig 7f which was consistent with the elemental composition of struvite the granularity characteristic of the recovered product was shown in fig s5 the particle size distribution range of the product was 0 2 100 μm and the median particle size d50 was 32 96 μm 200 mg of the precipitate obtained at the contact time of 60 min was dissolved in 2 mol l hcl solution the content of struvite in the precipitate was calculated to be 70 8 wt by measuring the concentrations of nh4 po4 3 and mg2 in the solution 3 4 proposed reaction mechanism the schematic diagram of the reaction mechanism is shown in fig 8 the raw serpentine ore was activated by the high energy ball mill in the milling process the serpentine particles were broken by the forces of compression impact and shear from zirconium balls causing the size to decrease also the crystal form of serpentine was destroyed which prompting mg2 and oh to be quickly released from serpentine into the aqueous solution eq 2 the dissolution rate of mg2 from the serpentine under various operating conditions is shown in fig s6 the dissolution rate of mg2 increased with the activation time and contact time as a result the ph and the concentration of mg2 in the solution both increased by adding active serpentine additionally the undissolved si containing particles acts as a seed crystal for struvite crystallization under the action of chemical crystallization potential energy po4 3 nh4 and mg2 combine to form struvite by eq 3 simultaneously the base provided by the active serpentine converts ammonium into volatile nh3 eq 4 resulting in a high removal rate of ammonia nitrogen as shown in fig s7 with the depletion of mg2 and oh in the solution by eqs 3 and 4 the active serpentine continuously dissolved in the solution stably providing magnesium ions and base the ultimate reaction of nh4 and oh brought about the decrease in ph and the ammonium concentration in solution leading to the dissolution of struvite eq 5 2 mg3si2o5 oh 4 3mg2 4oh sio3 2 sio2 3 mg2 nh4 hnpo4 3 n 6h2o mgnh4po4 6h2o nh 4 nh4 oh nh3 aq h2o 5 mgnh4po4 mg2 nh4 po4 3 3 5 pilot scale tests and economic evaluation a practical application was carried out in a rural public toilet in hebei province china the septic tank of a public toilet is about 30 m3 in the area the movable device can serve ten public toilets every month the raw black water was separated by a spiral sludge dewatering machine to roughly separate the feces and the neutral black water containing 148 3 mg l po4 p and 3206 mg l nh4 n was obtained which was then treated by the active serpentine process as shown in fig 9 at the dosage of active serpentine of 2 0 kg t the recovery rate of po4 p is reached to be 98 5 as shown in table 1 the concentration of po4 p in the black water is decreased to be 2 1 mg l from 148 3 after the treatment the main component of the recovered precipitate is struvite and the content is determined to be about 70 wt furthermore the techno economic evaluation of the active serpentine process was carried out in comparison with a common chemical process mgso4 6h2o and naoh a shown in table s2 the total cost is determined to be 3 77 cny t and 8 26 cny t for the active serpentine process and the chemical process respectively additionally about 1 kg of mgnh4po4 6h2o can be recovered per ton of the black water by the active serpentine process and the economical value generated is about 7 5 cny it can be seen that the use of active serpentine to recover phosphate from back water can achieve a balance of costs and benefits and even profitability is expected 4 conclusions in summary an economical natural mineral strategy to recover phosphate from black water as struvite has been proposed the mechanical activation can change the crystal structure of natural serpentine particles and promote the dissolution of mg2 and oh from the mineral structure into water the active serpentine was used to treat black water containing 132 8 mg l po4 p and 3144 mg l nh4 n the recovery rate of po4 p from the black water can reach 98 08 for 30 min contact time by adding 1 5g l active serpentine the recovery product was determined as struvite the maximum recovery capacity was about 159 37 mg p g the practical application to the rural public toilet can recover 98 of the phosphorus in public toilets reducing the phosphorus content in domestic sewage in the area compared with the traditional chemical process 54 4 of costs can be saved

common clay mineral with an abundance of oh functional groups 27 86 wt and mg ions 29 50 wt therefore serpentine is a potential source of magnesium and base for the struvite process our previous studies have demonstrated that mechanical activation can increase the activity of serpentine and enhance the dissolution of hydroxide and magnesium ions huang et al 2017 however the feasibility of using mechanically activated serpentine as a source of magnesium and base for struvite crystallization has not been confirmed herein the recovery of phosphate from wastewater by mechanically activated serpentine was proposed the motivation of this work is to determine whether struvite can be obtained from wastewater by using active serpentine and develop an economical and feasible technology for recovering phosphorus by struvite crystallization in this work the black water from a public toilet was pretreated by solid liquid separation to remove suspended solids and then was used for phosphorus recovery the nature serpentine was activated by a high energy planetary mill and added into the black water to recover phosphate the effect of mechanical activation on the serpentine was investigated to confirm the feasibility of active serpentine to release mg2 and oh by itself in solution then the performance of phosphate recovery was studied the recovered product was analyzed in detail the reaction mechanism was proposed based on laboratory results a movable pilot scale unit was designed and manufactured to treat the black water which confirmed the prospects of full scale application of the technology additionally the economic benefit analysis was carried out based on the optimal pilot test conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the massive serpentine ore was obtained from a mine in jiangsu province china the serpentine ore was crushed by a jaw crusher and sieved with a 0 45 mm steel screen fig s1 lizardite mg3si2o5 oh 4 pdf 01 086 0403 and brucite mg oh 2 pdf 01 076 0667 were the main mineral components of the serpentine powder fig s2a the granularity characteristic was displayed in fig s2b showing that the median diameter d50 of

hydroxide naoh and sulfuric acid h2so4 were purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd shanghai china the synthetic wastewater to be processed was made up of ultrapure water and chemical agents the ultrapure water used in this work was taken from milli q direct 8 16 18 2 mω cm the black water was collected from a public toilet in a rural village in xiong an new district hebei province china a spiral sludge dewatering machine was applied to roughly separate the feces in the black water and the filtrate obtained was as the starting solution to be processed the black water sample was stored at 4 c in a low temperature refrigerator the concentration of po4 p and nh4 n in the black water was measured to be 132 8 mg l and 3144 mg l respectively the ph of the black water was 7 3 2 2 batch experiments activating operation a high energy ball mill p 7 fritsch germany was employed to prepare active serpentine three grams of the serpentine powder were put into a zirconia jar with a capacity of 45 ml and 7 zirconia balls with a diameter of 15 mm were placed in the jar the running time of the ball mill was controlled at 15 30 60 90 and 120 min to prepare samples with different activation intensities the grinding speed was fixed at 500 rpm the prepared samples were stored in sealed bags for later use water leaching 80 mg of the active serpentine was added into a beaker containing 100 ml ultrapure water and stirred for 60 min at 300 rpm after leaching the equilibrium ph was measured by a ph meter a 5 ml water sample was taken from the beaker and filtered through a millipore filter with a pore size of 0 22 μm to measure the concentration of magnesium ions po4 p recovery 100 mg of the raw serpentine powder was added into 100 ml black water and stirred by a magnetic rotor at 300 rpm for 30 min then 5 ml aqueous solution was taken out and filtered by 0 22 μm millipore filter after standing for 30 min the precipitate was obtained by solid liquid separation with vacuum filtration the obtained precipitate was dried in an oven at 40 for 12 h the active serpentine with different activation intensities was used then the dosage of active serpentine was selected as 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 g l to treat the black water additionally the contact time was changed to 5 15 30 60 and 90 min while fixing other factors each of the above experiment was repeated three times pilot scale test a movable device was designed and manufactured as shown in fig s3 the volume of the mixed reaction tank of the device is 600 l which is the same as the volume of settlement overflow tank the total power of the equipment is 1 11 kw the pilot scale activated serpentine was produced by a planetary mill equipped with 4 grinding jars 4 25 l which can produce 30 kg of active serpentine at a time the power of the ball mill was 11kw the activation time was controlled at 90 min the schematic diagram of the device is shown in fig 1 the black water is pumped into the reaction tank and then mixed with the active serpentine after the reaction the solution enters the sedimentation overflow tank the precipitate is recovered at the bottom and the supernatant overflows into drain pipe the reaction time was fixed at 60 min and the dosage of the active serpentine was adjusted to be 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 kg t common chemical process the agent of mgso4 6h2o was added into the black water and the molar ratio of mg p was fixed at 2 1 the equilibrium ph of the reaction system was stabilize at 9 3 9 5 by adding naoh and the reaction time was set at 60 min the consumption of naoh and mgso4 6h2o was recorded 2 3 characterization the concentration of mg2 was determined by an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer optima 8300 usa the concentration of p and n was determined by a uv spectrophotometer hach dr 2800 according to colorimetry gb 11893 89 and gb 7479 87 the phase of the sample was identified by an x ray diffractometer xrd xpert pro mpd with a cu kα x

resolution scanning electron microscope s 3000n hitachi japan the ph was determined by a ph meter phs 25 m leici china a laser particle size analyzer malvern 2000 uk was used to analyze the granularity of samples the infrared spectrum characteristics of samples were measured by using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer thermo scientific nicolet is5 the recovery rate of po4 p was calculated by eq 1 1 r c 0 c 1 c 0 100 in the formula r is the recovery rate c 0 represents the initial concentration of po4 p in solution and c 1 represents the residual concentration of po4 p after the reaction at given time 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of mechanical activation on the serpentine the feasibility of simultaneous supply of mg2 and base by the active serpentine was investigated by water leaching tests firstly as shown in fig 2 a the concentration of mg2 is only 4 35 mg l without activation with the extension of the activation the concentration of mg2 increases from 8 91 mg l at 15min to 19 38 mg l at 120 min fig 2b shows that the ph increased from 8 5 at 0 min to 11 2 at 120 min it is demonstrated that the mechanical activation can enhance the dissolution of serpentine which can provide mg2 and base spontaneously in aqueous solution the effect of the activation process on the crystal structure of serpentine is shown in fig 2c the phases of serpentine pdf 01 086 0403 mg3si2o3 oh 4 and brucite pdf 01 076 0667 mg oh 2 are determined in the raw material the raw material has sharp x ray diffraction peaks indicating that the mineral is well crystallized however when mechanical activation was applied to the serpentine ore the x ray diffraction peak intensity of the sample begins to decrease the higher the activation intensity the weaker the diffraction peak intensity and the longer the half height width of the diffraction peak it can be inferred that the unit cell of the mineral particles is destroyed by the action of mechanical activation also it indicates that the ionic bonds in the serpentine structural unit are broken by the milling process the rupture of ionic bonds is conducive to the dissolution of mg2 and oh from solid particles into aqueous solution which was coincided with the results of fig 2a additionally the change of chemical bond on the surface of solid particles was studied by the infrared spectrometer as shown in fig 2d for the raw martial the sharp peak at 3690 cm 1 was attributed to oh mg oh stretching vibration which is a unique and distinguishing characteristic of the serpentine group with the increase of activation time the absorption peak of 3690 cm 1 becomes weaker and weaker indicating that more and more oh mg oh groups are broken the peaks at 3445 and 1635 cm 1 are related to the stretching and bending modes of h2o the peaks of 1081 and 957 cm 1 are corresponded to si o si apical stretching vibration and si o si basal stretching vibration respectively the peaks of 610 and 442 cm 1 are both due to mg oh bending vibration lu et al 2019 after 120 min of mechanical activation the absorption peaks of 1081 and 610 cm 1 almost disappear indicating that the o si o and mg oh groups on the serpentine particle surface are reduced by the process additionally the peak position of the basal stretching vibration of si o si moves from 957 to 992 cm 1 indicating that the bond energy of si o si is weakened by the activation the morphological characteristic of the serpentine ore with different activation time is shown in fig 3 the raw serpentine particles have irregular contours and the diameters are in the range of 10 30 μm fig 3a b with 30 min of activation the particle diameter is significantly reduced fig 3c when the activation time exceeds 30 min the particle diameter no longer changes significantly fig 3d f fig s4 shows the median diameter of the serpentine powder at different activation time the median diameter d50 represents the particle size at which the particle mass is divided into two equal halves the d50 of the raw serpentine powder is 35 32 μm after being milled for15 min the d50 decreases to 11 81 μm with a prolongation of activation time from 30 to 120 min the d50 becomes stable at around 10 μm it was found that the activation operation can reduce particle size quickly however crushing agglomeration and reorganization may coexist during the milling process thus the particle size did not always decrease with the extension of the activation time instead the crystal structure of the particles has changed irreversibly as shown fig 2c in short the mechanical activation can significantly change the crystal structure and chemical bonds of the serpentine increasing the water solubility of serpentine thus the active serpentine has the potential to be used as a source of magnesium and base 3 2 performance of po4 p removal from the black water by active serpentine the effect of operational factors on the recovery of po4 p was investigated the influence of activation intensity is shown in fig 4 a without activation 0 min the recovery rate of po4 p is only 19 31 as the extension of activation time the recovery rate of po4 p increases to 64 17 and 93 56 at 30 min and 120 min respectively considering energy cost we recommended an activation time of 90 min in this work the effect of dosage is shown in fig 4b it can be seen that the recovery rate of po4 p increases with the dosage of active serpentine the recovery rate is 98 08 when the dosage is 1 5 g l as the dosage is increased to be 2 0 g l the recovery rate is 98 60 the contact time is critical to the performance of po4 p recovery thus the effect of contact time was investigated by fixing activation time and dosage from fig 4c it can be seen that the recovery rate of po4 p increases from 72 05 at 5 min to 98 08 at 30 min and then remains constant within 30 90 min it indicates that 30 60 min of contact time is suitable the concentration of residual mg2 in filtrate and the corresponding ph were investigated as shown in fig 4d f the overall trend of mg2 concentration and the ph are positively correlated with variables with sufficient activation time dosage and contact time the serpentine powder can supply magnesium ions and base for recovering phosphorus from black water in order to investigate the kinetic of po4 p recovery by the active serpentine process the relation between recovery and contact time was studied by adjusting the serpentine dosage as shown in fig 5 a the recovery rate of po4 p increases with the contact time extension from 5 to 60 min after that the recovery rate of po4 p begins to decrease slightly it can be inferred that with the extension of the reaction time the precipitates may undergo secondary dissolution thereby reducing the recovery rate of po4 p as such a reaction time fewer than 60 min was proposed here it can be seen from fig 5b that the recovery capability increases firstly and then decreases with the increase of po4 p concentration the maximum recovery capacity is about 159 37 mg p g however as the concentration of po4 p increases to 10 mm the recovery capacity decreases to 118 5 mg p g the decrease in recovery capability was most likely due to the decrease in ph as shown in fig 5b the equilibrium ph of the reaction system decreases with the increase of po4 p concentration it may be due to the buffering effect of phosphate and ammonium in the solution a suitable ph 9 10 was required for struvite crystallization and the decrease in ph was not beneficial to the recovery of po4 p this may explain why the recovery capacity of po4 p is decreased at a higher po4 p concentration 3 3 precipitate analysis to investigate the process of the po4 p removal the main components of the precipitates obtained from the treatment of the black water were analyzed by an x ray diffractometer fig 6 a shows the xrd patterns of the precipitates obtained by adding the active serpentine in the case of raw serpentine ore 0 min the main phases of the precipitate were determined as serpentine and brucite in addition a small number of struvite crystals appears in the precipitate as the increase of the activation intensity the intensity of the diffraction peak of struvite increased significantly it shows that the active serpentine could combine phosphate and ammonium in the solution to effectively transform into struvite the composition of the precipitate changed with the reaction time as shown in fig 6b it can be seen that after 15 min of reaction the struvite appears in the precipitate additionally the remaining serpentine was found in the white precipitate with the extension of the reaction time the intensity of struvite diffraction peaks increased fig 6c showed the ftir spectrum of the precipitate obtained at different reaction time the sharp peak at 3694 cm 1 was attributed to o h stretching vibration the peaks at 3448 and 1637 cm 1 were related to the stretching and bending modes of h2o the shark peak at 1000 cm 1 was due to the si o si basal stretching vibration while the peak of 463 cm 1 was due to mg oh bending vibration lu et al 2019 for the samples of 15 30 45 and 60 min a broad asymmetric band of 3800 cm 1 to 2200 cm 1 was observed which could be ascribed to oh and nh stretching vibration wei et al 2019 the peak of 1434 cm 1 was due to the antisymmetric bending ν4 of nh4 while those of 570 and 456 cm 1 were brought by the asymmetric bending ν4 and bending vibration ν2 of po4 3 respectively the peak at 760 cm 1 was attributed to the hydrogen bonding between h2o h2o liao et al 2020 shu et al 2019 overall the above analysis showed that the precipitate recovered in the process includes nh4 po4 3 h2o and mg similar to commercial struvite as such it is very likely that the po4 p was recovered as struvite by the treatment process the morphology and surface element characteristics of the precipitate recovered by the treatment process were investigated and the result is shown in fig 7 the morphology of the precipitate from the treatment by using raw serpentine powder is shown in fig 7a the precipitate is mainly composed of large irregularly shaped serpentine particles and there are a few small regular columnar particles which should be the produced struvite the precipitate from using the serpentine activated for 30 min is shown in fig 7b the volume of regular hexagonal columnar struvite particles occupies most of the volume of all particles and some other irregular particles were probably attributable to the remaining active serpentine as shown in fig 7c e most of the particles were in a regular column shape similar to the struvite particle shape reported by other documents shaddel et al 2020 the main elements on the surface of the precipitate from the treatment using the active serpentine were o mg p and n fig 7f which was consistent with the elemental composition of struvite the granularity characteristic of the recovered product was shown in fig s5 the particle size distribution range of the product was 0 2 100 μm and the median particle size d50 was 32 96 μm 200 mg of the precipitate obtained at the contact time of 60 min was dissolved in 2 mol l hcl solution the content of struvite in the precipitate was calculated to be 70 8 wt by measuring the concentrations of nh4 po4 3 and mg2 in the solution 3 4 proposed reaction mechanism the schematic diagram of the reaction mechanism is shown in fig 8 the raw serpentine ore was activated by the high energy ball mill in the milling process the serpentine particles were broken by the forces of compression impact and shear from zirconium balls causing the size to decrease also the crystal form of serpentine was destroyed which prompting mg2 and oh to be quickly released from serpentine into the aqueous solution eq 2 the dissolution rate of mg2 from the serpentine under various operating conditions is shown in fig s6 the dissolution rate of mg2 increased with the activation time and contact time as a result the ph and the concentration of mg2 in the solution both increased by adding active serpentine additionally the undissolved si containing particles acts as a seed crystal for struvite crystallization under the action of chemical crystallization potential energy po4 3 nh4 and mg2 combine to form struvite by eq 3 simultaneously the base provided by the active serpentine converts ammonium into volatile nh3 eq 4 resulting in a high removal rate of ammonia nitrogen as shown in fig s7 with the depletion of mg2 and oh in the solution by eqs 3 and 4 the active serpentine continuously dissolved in the solution stably providing magnesium ions and base the ultimate reaction of nh4 and oh brought about the decrease in ph and the ammonium concentration in solution leading to the dissolution of struvite eq 5 2 mg3si2o5 oh 4 3mg2 4oh sio3 2 sio2 3 mg2 nh4 hnpo4 3 n 6h2o mgnh4po4 6h2o nh 4 nh4 oh nh3 aq h2o 5 mgnh4po4 mg2 nh4 po4 3 3 5 pilot scale tests and economic evaluation a practical application was carried out in a rural public toilet in hebei province china the septic tank of a public toilet is about 30 m3 in the area the movable device can serve ten public toilets every month the raw black water was separated by a spiral sludge dewatering machine to roughly separate the feces and the neutral black water containing 148 3 mg l po4 p and 3206 mg l nh4 n was obtained which was then treated by the active serpentine process as shown in fig 9 at the dosage of active serpentine of 2 0 kg t the recovery rate of po4 p is reached to be 98 5 as shown in table 1 the concentration of po4 p in the black water is decreased to be 2 1 mg l from 148 3 after the treatment the main component of the recovered precipitate is struvite and the content is determined to be about 70 wt furthermore the techno economic evaluation of the active serpentine process was carried out in comparison with a common chemical process mgso4 6h2o and naoh a shown in table s2 the total cost is determined to be 3 77 cny t and 8 26 cny t for the active serpentine process and the chemical process respectively additionally about 1 kg of mgnh4po4 6h2o can be recovered per ton of the black water by the active serpentine process and the economical value generated is about 7 5 cny it can be seen that the use of active serpentine to recover phosphate from back water can achieve a balance of costs and benefits and even profitability is expected 4 conclusions in summary an economical natural mineral strategy to recover phosphate from black water as struvite has been proposed the mechanical activation can change the crystal structure of natural serpentine particles and promote the dissolution of mg2 and oh from the mineral structure into water the active serpentine was used to treat black water containing 132 8 mg l po4 p and 3144 mg l nh4 n the recovery rate of po4 p from the black water can reach 98 08 for 30 min contact time by adding 1 5g l active serpentine the recovery product was determined as struvite the maximum recovery capacity was about 159 37 mg p g the practical application to the rural public toilet can recover 98 of the phosphorus in public toilets reducing the phosphorus content in domestic sewage in the area compared with the traditional chemical process 54 4 of costs can be saved

15731,a detailed experimental study is presented on fouling behavior of the anti clogging perforated plate atomizer designed for high salinity applications and compared with a conventional plain jet airblast atomizer low pressure regions around fast moving air in the outer layer of spray as in conventional atomizers plain jet and prefilming due to venturi suction were identified as the root cause of atomizer clogging as they facilitate salt accumulation on the atomizer surface from spray accordingly severe atomizer fouling and fluctuations in spray cone angle were observed in the conventional airblast atomizer over 2 h at 100 c air and 50 c saline 44 to 76 at 35 000 ppm and 44 to 91 at 100 000 ppm in this regard the perforated plate atomizer provides a novel liquid film airblast atomization by maintaining a liquid annulus film around the air outlet as the outer layer of spray doing so we achieved nearly complete suppression of fouling and spray cone angle fluctuations 28 1 at 35 000 ppm and 30 1 at 100 000 ppm later novel liquid film atomization was adopted in the conventional airblast atomizer while the conventional airblast atomization needed atomizer cleaning maintenance after 35 min for 175 c air and 65 c saline at 100 000 ppm the liquid film atomization showed no sign of fouling over 14 h hence current work establishes a benchmark liquid film airblast atomization mechanism in the anti clogging perforated plate atomizer for complete suppression of fouling in airblast atomization this extends the application of airblast atomizers from high evaporation jet engines to zld hdh desalination systems spraying powder metallurgy pharmaceuticals and hospitals and spray drying and cooling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

small to large scale and high salinity water desalination abdelmoez mahmoud and farrag 2014 o hern et al 2021 zero liquid discharge zld water desalination which stands for no liquid lost in system waste i e such technologies produce dry salt as waste rather than high concentration brine discharge has gained interest of researchers when zld is incorporated with renewable energy or low grade heat powered hdh the desalination system addresses two primary objectives sustainable freshwater supply with less carbon emissions from fossil fuel based energy and zero waste brine disposal to the environment leaving no harmful effects accordingly a novel solar powered desalination technology combining zld and hdh for hypersaline water with 100 000 200 000 ppm total dissolved solids tds is developed at oregon state university abbasi et al 2020 it involves atomization of saline water by thermally actuated air jets using solar thermal energy to produce saline water spray spray further evaporates to produce humid air and salt particles in a particle laden stream salt particles are separated from humid air in a cyclone separator vapor is condensed from salt free humid air to produce freshwater the technology is designed to be modular portable and powered by low grade heat to treat hypersaline water freshwater production rates and efficiencies of hdh desalination systems could be increased by increasing the saline water evaporation rate or humidification xu et al 2020 accordingly various humidifiers have been developed li et al 2014 nada et al 2021 based on the process of humidification humidifiers can mainly be classified as bubble humidifiers khan et al 2021 pad humidifiers nada et al 2021 spray humidifiers kang et al 2014 and vaporizers gaffney and dalton 2021 as summarized in table 1 among them the spray humidifier is found to be optimal for zld hdh as others face either severe fouling of the system or process limitations for 100 water recovery in spray humidifiers atomizers are used to disintegrate liquid in droplets and then gas stream is passed through the spray based on the process of disintegration atomizers can be divided into three main categories rotary atomizers pressure atomizers and airblast atomizers vasilyev et al 2019 rotary atomizers and pressure atomizers are not suitable for a zld hdh desalination as they either become bulky to accommodate larger mass flow rates or require high liquid pressure and a small orifice prone to clogging at elevated temperatures and salinities to produce a fine spray on the contrary airblast atomizers are not bulky and generate a fine spray with comparatively lower operating pressure and a larger orifice they also facilitate thorough mixing of liquid with atomizing air providing high evaporation rates lorenzetto and lefebvre 1977a accordingly airblast atomizers are extensively studied in the literature and widely used in various systems seeking for high evaporation rates such as gas turbine engines lefebvre 1980 industrial furnaces and boilers aircraft engines déjean berthoumieu and gajan 2016c internal combustion engines guo et al 2016 and liquid propellant rocket engines in spite of their technical advantages and advancement airblast atomizers have rarely been used in hdh desalination systems one such study was found where dayem 2011 presented an extension of the airblast atomizer application to a hdh desalination system an airblast atomizer was used to facilitate humidification and produce 36 liter day of freshwater using solar energy and auxiliary heaters and 12 liter day using only solar energy at a cost of 0 2 li special emphasis was put on use of airblast atomizers in hdh desalination systems to enhance yield however in experiments the atomizer was operated at a temperature lower than 70 c to avoid clogging which limited the maximum freshwater production rate however no details regarding the atomizer fouling were discussed the literature related to the use of airblast atomizers in hdh desalination systems and their fouling suppression is scarce accordingly coupling airblast atomizers with hdh desalination systems needs further research especially in optimizing airblast atomizers to further their capabilities in saline atomization and evaporation at elevated temperatures and salinities while suppressing atomizer fouling in this regard a novel anti clogging perforated plate airblast atomizer was developed for a zld hdh desalination systems abbasi et al 2020 spray characteristics droplet size and spray cone angle of the perforated plate atomizer were studied for different geometric and operating conditions sharma et al 2021 the atomizer was operated at 2 g s air at 100 175 c and 2 g s saline with 100 000 ppm nacl only at 30 45 c for 2 13 h no fouling was observed at the atomizer however nacl was the only salt present in saline and no comparative analysis on the fouling behavior was included with a conventional airblast atomizer though nacl constitutes the maximum percentage by weight of all dissolved salts in saline from natural resources the presence of other salts e g magnesium chloride sodium sulfate and calcium chloride creates a complex aqueous environment with a higher tendency for scale formation or atomizer fouling helalizadeh et al 2000 the purpose of current research work is to methodologically examine fouling behavior of the anti clogging perforated plate airblast atomizer with all salts present in natural saline and compare with fouling in conventional airblast atomizer while significant fouling was found in the conventional airblast atomizer a remarkable suppression of atomizer fouling was demonstrated by the perforated plate atomizer this is attributed to novel liquid film airblast atomization mechanism facilitated by the perforated plate atomizer fouling mechanism in conventional airblast atomizers plain jet and prefilming is described paper concludes with complete suppression of fouling for 14 h of test in comparison to 35 min of maintenance time of the conventional airblast atomization the liquid film atomization shows a steady performance over 14 h suggesting that no maintenance required even after that accordingly presented work establishes a benchmark airblast atomization mechanism for high salinity up to 100 000 ppm tds and temperature up to 175 c air and 65 c saline applications complimented with enhanced atomization significant evaporation suppressed fouling reduced maintenance cost open surface design and easy manufacturing these features make our perforated plate atomizer a suitable and affordable candidate for applications in zld hdh desalination systems spraying coating powder metallurgy pharmaceuticals and hospitals and spray drying and cooling 2 experimental setup and methodology 2 1 atomizers fig 1 shows photographs of both the perforated plate airblast atomizer and the conventional airblast atomizer the perforated plate atomizer fig 1a is 3d printed using polyamide 12 25 mineral filled nylon pa12 mf as it is corrosive resistant and has a high heat deflection temperature of 179 c the atomizer consists of four liquid feeding channels through which liquid flows radially inward into the liquid manifold of 4 mm diameter and 1 mm height an air outlet 2 mm diameter is at the center of liquid manifold providing a vertical air jet the liquid manifold forms a liquid annulus around the air outlet or air jet liquid annulus facilitates atomization at the liquid air interface with the maximum practical relative velocity in vertical direction this also acts as a blanket around the air outlet suppressing contact between the spray and the atomizer surface for more details regarding the operation of the atomizer readers are referred to our previous publication about the development and characterization of the perforated plate atomizer sharma et al 2021 a plain jet external mix ss316 conventional airblast atomizer ispray sue45a ss was selected for fouling tests in the current study similar to the atomizer used by elhashimi et al 2021 for saline atomization as shown in fig 1b saline flows through the inner orifice of 2 mm diameter outlet 1 blue arrow and is surrounded by a concentric annulus of air outlet 2 green arrow two auxiliary air jets meet the flow at an inward inclination outlet 3 two brown arrows to facilitate secondary atomization as the conventional atomizer has more air outlets and thus larger flow area 8 8 mm2 than the perforated plate atomizer 3 1 mm2 air mass flow rate was normalized with air flow area resulting in air mass flux and was kept constant for both the atomizers during fouling tests 2 2 experimental setup an experimental facility was developed to perform tests on the

photograph of the experimental setup on the conventional airblast atomizer tests were performed by connecting air and saline lines from the same experimental setup to their respective ports in the atomizer 1 1 experimental methodology and data reduction temperatures pressures and volumetric flow rate of air were measured in the air line and used to calculate air density and mass flow rate using engineering equation solver ees liquid flow rate was set to the desired value in the peristaltic pump variacs were used to control power input to in line heaters for maintaining desired air t a and liquid saline t s temperatures the perforated plate and the conventional airblast atomizers have different designs especially the air flow area while the perforated plate atomizer has only one air outlet at the center 3 1 mm2 the conventional airblast atomizer has an air annulus around the water jet 2 and two auxiliary air outlets 3 providing 8 8 mm2 area fig 1 therefore air mass flow rate was normalized with air flow area air mass flux and kept constant for both the atomizers during fouling tests both atomizers were operated for a constant water mass flow rate of 2 0 g s at 50 c and air mass flux varying from 2 3 g cm2s to 98 7 g cm2s at 100 c in order to find comparable operating conditions for fouling tests fig 3 shows the spray pictures 3a air pressure drops 3b and air mass flux 3c for different air mass flow rates both atomizers attained a steady spray atomization for similar air mass fluxes 30 g cm2s which suggests that mature spray was attained for similar air velocities or air mass flux in both the atomizer pressure drop in the perforated plate atomizer was found higher than the conventional airblast atomizer due to smaller air flow area as the airblast atomization involves two components air and saline and two phases gaseous and liquid one more comparable operating parameter should be kept constant to fully describe operating regimes for fouling tests the saline mass flow rate determines the amount of salt being fed to the atomizer and should affect the fouling accordingly for the first fouling test saline mass flow rate m s 2 g s was kept constant along with the constant air mass flux m a 30 5 1 9 g cm2s as listed in table 2 later air mass flux m a 30 5 1 9 g cm2s and air to liquid ratio alr 2 were kept constant for the second fouling test for similar atomization conditions spray cone of 28 1 was observed in case of the perforated plate atomizer and 44 4 1 2 and 43 5 1 0 for 2 g s and 5 g s of water respectively in case of the conventional airblast atomizer for fouling tests artificial saline with 35 000 ppm and 100 000 ppm tds was prepared by mixing sea salt astm d1141 98 composition is summarized in table 3 with deionized water during experiments scale formation occurred on the conventional airblast atomizer which chipped off with time and formed again this altered air and liquid flow in the atomizer thereby altering its spray cone angle while accurately quantifying the fouling rate was not possible with the chipping off of salt deposits the spray cone angle was selected as the parameter to monitor atomizer performance over time similarly the performance of the perforated plate atomizer performance was monitored using the spray cone angle spray cone angle was measured as the angle between edges of the spray cone in line with the literature zhao et al 2018 the detailed description on the image set up and calibration can be found in our previous publication sharma et al 2021 θ s represents the arithmetic mean of spray cone angles measured for particular test photographs of both atomizers were taken at intervals of 30 mi to identify any visible fouling or salt deposition atomizer insets are incorporated in section 3 further in order to account the effect of airblast atomization mechanism on the maintenance time and avoid the effects of different materials of make for the atomizers the conventional airblast atomizer was operated with closed auxiliary air outlets outlet 3 in fig 1 mimicking both atomization configurations viz i the conventional airblast atomization air annulus outlet 2 around saline jet outlet 1 and ii the liquid film airblast atomization saline annulus outlet 2 around air jet outlet 1 atomizer fouling was compared in the conventional atomizer operated in stated two modes and the perforated plate atomizer at similar operating conditions same air mass flux saline mass flow rate and alr 35 5 g cm2s of air at 175 c was used to atomize 2 g s saline at 65 c with 100 000 ppm tds maintaining alr 2 properties of saline for different temperatures and salinities are mentioned in table 4 spray cone angle and air mass flux as air passes through a single outlet were monitored to evaluate the atomizer performance over time while in the conventional atomization the air orifice was fouled impending the air flow and started producing water jets after 1 5 h a complete suppression of fouling was demonstrated over 14 h of operation in liquid film atomization saline annulus around air jet 1 2 uncertainly analysis uncertainty in sensor reading contributes to total error in measured parameters uncertainties were collected from datasheets for each measurement device and combined with uncertainty due to repeatability from three repeatability tests using uncertainty propagation analysis coleman and steele 1995 to estimate overall error in parameters of interest as summarized in table 5 2 result and discussion first this section describes the effect of fouling on the atomizer performance over time in terms of the spray cone angle for the perforated plate atomizer ppa and the conventional airblast atomizer caa later atomizer fouling in case of novel liquid film atomization and the conventional airblast atomization is presented at elevated operating temperatures and salinity along with the perforated plate atomizer fouling 2 1 perforated plate versus conventional airblast atomizer test conditions m a 30 5 g cm2s and m s 2 g s the perforated plate atomizer demonstrated near complete suppression of atomizer fouling via maintaining a saline annulus around the air jet and no significant change was observed in the spray cone angle over 2 h blue in figs 4 and 5 the saline annulus film acts as a blanket on the atomizer surface and prevents direct contact with spray this prevents any accumulation of salts on the atomizer surface around the air outlet more details on the atomization mechanism are presented in our previous publication sharma et al 2021 and thus the atomizer fouling however minimal fouling was seen a few millimeters upstream inside the air outlet it might be due to secretion of saline inside the air outlet under the influence of capillary flow liu et al 2011 knowingly pa12 mf has a rough surface r a 16 μ m the saline annulus film dissolves the fouling up to a few millimeters upstream inside the air outlet due to concentration gradient hong et al 2002 and thus inhibits self cleaning in the perforated plate atomizer the spray cone angle slightly increased for 100 000 ppm on increasing salinity 28 1ᵒ for 0 ppm 27 5ᵒ for 35 000 ppm and 30 4ᵒ for 100 000 ppm and so did minimal fouling inside the air outlet increase in spray cone angle after 35 000 ppm was due to increase in saline viscosity for higher salinity davanlou et al 2015 increasing salinity increases the fouling rate but deteriorates the rate of self cleaning leading to larger fouling size however fouling inside the air outlet did not affect the atomizer performance spray cone angle over time and could be further reduced by surface smoothening to prevent capillary flow of saline in case of the conventional airblast atomizer the spray cone angle remained steady over time for 0 ppm but it increased for 35 000 ppm and 100 000 ppm dissolved salts precipitate as the vigorous mixing of air and saline causes significant evaporation of water it leads to atomizer fouling and gradual salt buildup with time as evident from the atomizer pictures shown in fig 5 at intervals of 30 minu salt buildups mainly occurred around the air outlets outlet 2 and 3 not the saline outlet at the center outlet 1 first these results suggest that fouling due to the atomization process is the dominant mechanism compared to the fouling due to saline flow through the center second fast moving air jets exert venturi suction in the vicinity of air outlets generating low pressure regions this results in localized evaporation and salt accumulation around the air outlets giving rise to the nucleation of salt buildup as shown in fig 5 the fact that the salt particles are not blown away and rather stick to the surface proves that they are drawn to the atomizer surface via venturi suction therefore in case of the perforated plate atomizer where a saline annulus maintained around the air outlet not only prevents the direct contact of the atomizer surface and spray but must suppresses the venturi suction induced low pressure regions for near complete suppression of the fouling further in the conventional airblast atomizer larger salt buildups were observed in case of 100 000 ppm due to higher salt concentration giving rise to more salt accumulation around the air outlets accordingly larger fluctuations were observed in the spray cone angle for 100 000 ppm 44 to 67 in comparison to 35 000 ppm 44 to 57 as shown in fig 4 test conditions m a 30 5 g cm2s and alr 2 fig 6 shows variation of the spray cone angle and corresponding atomizer orifice pictures are shown in fig 7 over the duration of 2 h as expected higher saline mass flow rate from 2 0 g s to 5 0 g s in order to maintain same alr resulted in increased atomizer fouling increasing the spray cone angle fluctuation to 44 to 76 for 35 000 ppm and 44 to 91 for 100 000 ppm accordingly operating both atomizers at similar atomization condition severe the fouling in the conventional airblast atomizer in comparison to the perforated plate atomizer demonstrating near complete suppression of fouling the results presented above show severe fouling in the conventional airblast atomizer due to the accumulation of salt in the low pressure regions around the air outlets presence of fast moving air as the outer layer of spray promotes atomizer fouling accordingly a detailed literature review was performed on the airblast atomizers and it was found that air as the outer layer of spray is the conventional way of airblast atomization in both plain jet atomizers lorenzetto and lefebvre 1977 urbán et al 2020 jin et al 2021 and prefilming atomizers sattelmayer and wittig 1986 roudini and wozniak 2018 chaussonnet et al 2020 which is prone to severe fouling on the other hand the perforated plate atomizer needed less air for atomization and remarkably suppressed fouling with the help of a novel liquid film airblast atomization mechanism the perforated plate atomizer ensures the maximum practical vertical relative velocity between air and liquid streams and suppresses low pressure region around the air outlet by maintaining saline annulus film around the air orifice or air jet minimal fouling inside the air outlet did not affect the spray cone angle over 2 h as summarized in table 6 and could be reduced by surface smoothening further open surface design and easy manufacturing additive as well as subtractive allows us to incorporate multiple air orifices in single perforated plate atomizer to accommodate larger saline mass flow rates and achieve larger spray distribution area different material of make for both atomizers can also contribute to the fouling behavior discrepancy to an extent in order to eliminate the effect of material properties on atomizer fouling in current study teng et al 2017 auxiliary air outlets 3 in fig 1 were closed and the conventional airblast atomizer was operated with both conventional plain jet airblast atomization mechanism air annulus around saline jet and liquid film airblast atomization saline annulus around saline jet and is presented next 2 2 liquid film versus conventional plain jet airblast atomization test conditions m a 35 5 g cm2s m s 2 g s and alr 2 the conventional airblast atomizer was operated with closed auxiliary air passes outlet 3 in fig 1 and two air saline orientations air annulus outlet 2 around saline jet outlet 1 as in the conventional airblast atomization and saline annulus outlet 2 around air jet outlet 1 as in the novel liquid film airblast atomization presented in current study air was maintained at 175 c and saline at 65 c with 100 000 ppm tds fig 8 shows the air mass flux for the conventional atomizer operated in two modes conventional and the liquid film atomization and the perforated plate atomizer over time air in the conventional atomization initially dropped for 35 min followed by large fluctuations zoomed in inset in fig 8 and atomizer maintenance was needed the spray cone angle initially increased for 0 5 h and dropped over time due to salt accumulation around the air outlet of atomizer as shown in fig 9 after 0 5 h air started chipping off salt buildups which resulted in large fluctuations in the spray cone angle and air mass flow rate the test had to stop after 1 5 h of operation as the atomizer started generating liquid jets rather than a spray fig 9 as evident fluctuations in air mass flux were maximum in the conventional airblast atomization followed by the perforated plate airblast atomizer and the liquid film airblast atomization while the perforated plate atomizer was able to completely suppress fouling around air outlet and maintain a steady spray cone angle fig 9 minimal fouling inside the air outlet caused fluctuations in air mass flux fig 8 please note that due to secretion of saline inside the air outlet under the influence of capillary flow on rough pa12 mf surface r a 1 6 μ m minimal fouling was seen a few millimeters upstream inside the air outlet as discussed previously overall suppression of fouling resulted in suppression of fluctuations in spray cone angle in comparison to the conventional airblast atomization however the liquid film airblast atomization with saline annulus as expected continuously maintained a steady air mass flux over 14 h of operation with a steady spray cone angle the atomizer pictures in fig 9 shows a complete suppression of atomizer fouling over 14 h while the liquid film atomization suppressed fouling around the air outlet as in the perforated plate atomizer minimal fouling was also completely eliminated due to smoother ss316 surface r a 0 8 μ m suppressing the saline capillary secretion inside the air outlet and higher thermal conductivity of ss316 facilitating heat transfer from air to saline annulus promoting self cleaning of atomizer additionally fouling was reduced on the atomizer body in comparison with the conventional atomization which suggests that suppression of low pressure regions by the liquid film atomization is not only limited to the vicinity of air outlet but also on a larger scale whole atomizer body results also demonstrate that the novel liquid film airblast atomization can be adopted in the conventional atomizers for complete suppression of fouling corrosion was observed on the atomizer body after operating it for 14 h therefore the liquid film atomizer should be made of polymers to avoid corrosion of atomizer body as in current study with smoother surface to avoid fouling due to capillary flow higher thermal conductivity of polymers is an aid to self cleaning via increased heat transfer hence presented work establishes an anti clogging perforated plate atomizer and a benchmark liquid film airblast atomization mechanism for remarkable suppression of fouling in airblast atomizers table 7 summarizes the characteristics of the novel liquid film airblast and the conventional airblast atomization mechanism plain jet and prefilming excellent atomization leading to significant evaporation suppressed fouling reduced maintenance cost open surface design and easy manufacturing cheap make the liquid film airblast atomization as the most suitable and affordable choice among the airblast atomizers for contaminated liquid airblast atomization applications seeking for high evaporation rate such as zld hdh desalination systems powder metallurgy pharmaceuticals and hospitals and spray drying and cooling the perforated plate atomizer in the current design state can operate only in one orientation vertical and spraying up however the design can be modified for other orientations by capping the liquid feeding channels this will ensure liquid supply to the manifold where liquid annulus will be stabilized by air venturi suction dominating gravity effects 3 conclusions current work experimentally investigates the anti clogging potential of the perforated plate airblast atomizer in comparison with the conventional airblast atomizer for high operating temperature and salinity applications root cause of airblast atomizer fouling was described and a benchmark liquid film airblast atomization is established for complete suppression of fouling which can also be implemented in the existing airblast atomizers in sharp contrast to the conventional airblast atomizers plain jet and prefilming wherein air is in the outer layer of the spray in liquid film airblast atomization saline is the outer layer which impedes salt accumulation at the atomizer surface this resulted in complete suppression of fouling steady spray cone angle and air mass flux leading to uniform operation for over 14 h while the conventional airblast atomizer needed to be cleaned after 35 min main outcomes of the present study are outlined below the conventional airblast atomizer faced severe fouling around the air outlet and fluctuations in the spray cone angle for m a 30 5 g cm2s and m s 2 g s 44 to 57 for 35 000 ppm and 44 to 67 for 100 000 ppm and for m a 30 5 g cm2s and alr 2 44 to 76 for 35 000 ppm and 44 to 91 for 100 000 ppm over 2 h at 100 c air and 50 c saline increasing saline mass flow rate severed the conventional airblast atomizer fouling the perforated plate atomizer with liquid film airblast atomization resulted in nearly complete suppression of fouling around the air outlet and a steady spray cone angle 28 1 for 35 000 ppm and 30 1 for 100 000 ppm for both tests same air mass flux and saline mass flow rate and same air mass flux and alr over 2 hours at 100 c air and 50 c saline minimal fouling seen a few millimeters upstream inside the air outlet of the perforated plate atomizer did not affect its performance over time and can be reduced by surface smoothening saline annulus film around the air outlet or air jet also facilitates self cleaning of the atomizer orifice this manuscript establishes a benchmark liquid film airblast atomization mechanism and the perforated plate atomizer for suppressing fouling in airblast atomization they are complimented with excellent atomization significant evaporation uniform spray multiple air outlets in single atomizer suppressed fouling reduced maintenance cost open surface design and easy manufacturing cheap these features make the perforated plate atomizer as the most suitable and affordable choice among the airblast atomizers for zld hdh desalination systems spraying powder metallurgy pharmaceuticals and hospitals and spray drying and cooling future studies can focus on studying the effect of orientation on the perforated plate atomizer operation further the liquid film airblast atomization can be implemented in the existing spray system having conventional airblast

15731,a detailed experimental study is presented on fouling behavior of the anti clogging perforated plate atomizer designed for high salinity applications and compared with a conventional plain jet airblast atomizer low pressure regions around fast moving air in the outer layer of spray as in conventional atomizers plain jet and prefilming due to venturi suction were identified as the root cause of atomizer clogging as they facilitate salt accumulation on the atomizer surface from spray accordingly severe atomizer fouling and fluctuations in spray cone angle were observed in the conventional airblast atomizer over 2 h at 100 c air and 50 c saline 44 to 76 at 35 000 ppm and 44 to 91 at 100 000 ppm in this regard the perforated plate atomizer provides a novel liquid film airblast atomization by maintaining a liquid annulus film around the air outlet as the outer layer of spray doing so we achieved nearly complete suppression of fouling and spray cone angle fluctuations 28 1 at 35 000 ppm and 30 1 at 100 000 ppm later novel liquid film atomization was adopted in the conventional airblast atomizer while the conventional airblast atomization needed atomizer cleaning maintenance after 35 min for 175 c air and 65 c saline at 100 000 ppm the liquid film atomization showed no sign of fouling over 14 h hence current work establishes a benchmark liquid film airblast atomization mechanism in the anti clogging perforated plate atomizer for complete suppression of fouling in airblast atomization this extends the application of airblast atomizers from high

small to large scale and high salinity water desalination abdelmoez mahmoud and farrag 2014 o hern et al 2021 zero liquid discharge zld water desalination which stands for no liquid lost in system waste i e such technologies produce dry salt as waste rather than high concentration brine discharge has gained interest of researchers when zld is incorporated with renewable energy or low grade heat powered hdh the desalination system addresses two primary objectives sustainable freshwater supply with less carbon emissions from fossil fuel based energy and zero waste brine disposal to the environment leaving no harmful effects accordingly a novel solar powered desalination technology combining zld and hdh for hypersaline water with 100 000 200 000 ppm total dissolved solids tds is developed at oregon state university abbasi et al 2020 it involves atomization of saline water by thermally actuated air jets using solar thermal energy to produce saline water spray spray further evaporates to produce humid air and salt particles in a particle laden stream salt particles are separated from humid air in a cyclone separator vapor is condensed from salt free humid air to produce freshwater the technology is designed to be modular portable and powered by low grade heat to treat hypersaline water freshwater production rates and efficiencies of hdh desalination systems could be increased by increasing the saline water evaporation rate or humidification xu et al 2020 accordingly various humidifiers have been developed li et al 2014 nada et al 2021 based on the process of humidification humidifiers can mainly be classified as bubble humidifiers khan et al 2021 pad humidifiers nada et al 2021 spray humidifiers kang et al 2014 and vaporizers gaffney and dalton 2021 as summarized in table 1 among them the spray humidifier is found to be optimal for zld hdh as others face either severe fouling of the system or process limitations for 100 water recovery in spray humidifiers atomizers are used to disintegrate liquid in droplets and then gas stream is passed through the spray based on the process of disintegration atomizers can be divided into three main categories rotary atomizers pressure atomizers and airblast atomizers vasilyev et al 2019 rotary atomizers and pressure atomizers are not suitable for a zld hdh desalination as they either become bulky to accommodate larger mass flow rates or require high liquid pressure and a small orifice prone to clogging at elevated temperatures and salinities to produce a fine spray on the contrary airblast atomizers are not bulky and generate a fine spray with comparatively lower operating pressure and a larger orifice they also facilitate thorough mixing of liquid with atomizing air providing high evaporation rates lorenzetto and lefebvre 1977a accordingly airblast atomizers are extensively studied in the literature and widely used in various systems seeking for high evaporation rates such as gas turbine engines lefebvre 1980 industrial furnaces and boilers aircraft engines déjean berthoumieu and gajan 2016c internal combustion engines guo et al 2016 and liquid propellant rocket engines in spite of their technical advantages and advancement airblast atomizers have rarely been used in hdh desalination systems one such study was found where dayem 2011 presented an extension of the airblast atomizer application to a hdh desalination system an airblast atomizer was used to facilitate humidification and produce 36 liter day of freshwater using solar energy and auxiliary heaters and 12 liter day using only solar energy at a cost of 0 2 li special emphasis was put on use of airblast atomizers in hdh desalination systems to enhance yield however in experiments the atomizer was operated at a temperature lower than 70 c to avoid clogging which limited the maximum freshwater production rate however no details regarding the atomizer fouling were discussed the literature related to the use of airblast atomizers in hdh desalination systems and their fouling suppression is scarce accordingly coupling airblast atomizers with hdh desalination systems needs further research especially in optimizing airblast atomizers to further their capabilities in saline atomization and evaporation at elevated temperatures and salinities while suppressing atomizer fouling in this regard a novel anti clogging perforated plate airblast atomizer was developed for a zld hdh desalination systems abbasi et al 2020 spray characteristics droplet size and spray cone angle of the perforated plate atomizer were studied for different geometric and operating conditions sharma et al 2021 the atomizer was operated at 2 g s air at 100 175 c and 2 g s saline with 100 000 ppm nacl only at 30 45 c for 2 13 h no fouling was observed at the atomizer however nacl was the only salt present in saline and no comparative analysis on the fouling behavior was included with a conventional airblast atomizer though nacl constitutes the maximum percentage by weight of all dissolved salts in saline from natural resources the presence of other salts e g magnesium chloride sodium sulfate and calcium chloride creates a complex aqueous environment with a higher tendency for scale formation or atomizer fouling helalizadeh et al 2000 the purpose of current research work is to methodologically examine fouling behavior of the anti clogging perforated plate airblast atomizer with all salts present in natural saline and compare with fouling in conventional airblast atomizer while significant fouling was found in the conventional airblast atomizer a remarkable suppression of atomizer fouling was demonstrated by the perforated plate atomizer this is attributed to novel liquid film airblast atomization mechanism facilitated by the perforated plate atomizer fouling mechanism in conventional airblast atomizers plain jet and prefilming is described paper concludes with complete suppression of fouling for 14 h of test in comparison to 35 min of maintenance time of the conventional airblast atomization the liquid film atomization shows a steady performance over 14 h suggesting that no maintenance required even after that accordingly presented work establishes a benchmark airblast atomization mechanism for high salinity up to 100 000 ppm tds and temperature up to 175 c air and 65 c saline applications complimented with enhanced atomization significant evaporation suppressed fouling reduced maintenance cost open surface design and easy manufacturing these features make our perforated plate atomizer a suitable and affordable candidate for applications in zld hdh desalination systems spraying coating powder metallurgy pharmaceuticals and hospitals and spray drying and cooling 2 experimental setup and methodology 2 1 atomizers fig 1 shows photographs of both the perforated plate airblast atomizer and the conventional airblast atomizer the perforated plate atomizer fig 1a is 3d printed using polyamide 12 25 mineral filled nylon pa12 mf as it is corrosive resistant and has a high heat deflection temperature of 179 c the atomizer consists of four liquid feeding channels through which liquid flows radially inward into the liquid manifold of 4 mm diameter and 1 mm height an air outlet 2 mm diameter is at the center of liquid manifold providing a vertical air jet the liquid manifold forms a liquid annulus around the air outlet or air jet liquid annulus facilitates atomization at the liquid air interface with the maximum practical relative velocity in vertical direction this also acts as a blanket around the air outlet suppressing contact between the spray and the atomizer surface for more details regarding the operation of the atomizer readers are referred to our previous publication about the development and characterization of the perforated plate atomizer sharma et al 2021 a plain jet external mix ss316 conventional airblast atomizer ispray sue45a ss was selected for fouling tests in the current study similar to the atomizer used by elhashimi et al 2021 for saline atomization as shown in fig 1b saline flows through the inner orifice of 2 mm diameter outlet 1 blue arrow and is surrounded by a concentric annulus of air outlet 2 green arrow two auxiliary air jets meet the flow at an inward inclination outlet 3 two brown arrows to facilitate secondary atomization as the conventional atomizer has more air outlets and thus larger flow area 8 8 mm2 than the perforated plate atomizer 3 1 mm2 air mass flow rate was normalized with air flow area resulting in air mass flux and was kept constant for both the atomizers during fouling tests 2 2 experimental setup an experimental facility was developed to perform tests on the perforated plate and the conventional airblast atomizers fig 2 shows cad and real picture of the experimental setup in the following description component numbers see caption of fig 2 are shown in

acquisition system 10 agilent 34972a with a computer 11 is connected to all sensors red dotted line in fig 4a to acquire pressures temperatures and volumetric flow rates of air and saline fig 2b is a photograph of the experimental setup on the conventional airblast atomizer tests were performed by connecting air and saline lines from the same experimental setup to their respective ports in the atomizer 1 1 experimental methodology and data reduction temperatures pressures and volumetric flow rate of air were measured in the air line and used to calculate air density and mass flow rate using engineering equation solver ees liquid flow rate was set to the desired value in the peristaltic pump variacs were used to control power input to in line heaters for maintaining desired air t a and liquid saline t s temperatures the perforated plate and the conventional airblast atomizers have different designs especially the air flow area while the perforated plate atomizer has only one air outlet at the center 3 1 mm2 the conventional airblast atomizer has an air annulus around the water jet 2 and two auxiliary air outlets 3 providing 8 8 mm2 area fig 1 therefore air mass flow rate was normalized with air flow area air mass flux and kept constant for both the atomizers during fouling tests both atomizers were operated for a constant water mass flow rate of 2 0 g s at 50 c and air mass flux varying from 2 3 g cm2s to 98 7 g cm2s at 100 c in order to find comparable operating conditions for fouling tests fig 3 shows the spray pictures 3a air pressure drops 3b and air mass flux 3c for different air mass flow rates both atomizers attained a steady spray atomization for similar air mass fluxes 30 g cm2s which suggests that mature spray was attained for similar air velocities or air mass flux in both the atomizer pressure drop in the perforated plate atomizer was found higher than the conventional airblast atomizer due to smaller air flow area as the airblast atomization involves two components air and saline and two phases gaseous and liquid one more comparable operating parameter should be kept constant to fully describe operating regimes for fouling tests the saline mass flow rate determines the amount of salt being fed to the atomizer and should affect the fouling accordingly for the first fouling test saline mass flow rate m s 2 g s was kept constant along with the constant air mass flux m a 30 5 1 9 g cm2s as listed in table 2 later air mass flux m a 30 5 1 9 g cm2s and air to liquid ratio alr 2 were kept constant for the second fouling test for similar atomization conditions spray cone of 28 1 was observed in case of the perforated plate atomizer and 44 4 1 2 and 43 5 1 0 for 2 g s and 5 g s of water respectively in case of the conventional airblast atomizer for fouling tests artificial saline with 35 000 ppm and 100 000 ppm tds was prepared by mixing sea salt astm d1141 98 composition is summarized in table 3 with deionized water during experiments scale formation occurred on the conventional airblast atomizer which chipped off with time and formed again this altered air and liquid flow in the atomizer thereby altering its spray cone angle while accurately quantifying the fouling rate was not possible with the chipping off of salt deposits the spray cone angle was selected as the parameter to monitor atomizer performance over time similarly the performance of the perforated plate atomizer performance was monitored using the spray cone angle spray cone angle was measured as the angle between edges of the spray cone in line with the literature zhao et al 2018 the detailed description on the image set up and calibration can be found in our previous publication sharma et al 2021 θ s represents the arithmetic mean of spray cone angles measured for particular test photographs of both atomizers were taken at intervals of 30 mi to identify any visible fouling or salt deposition atomizer insets are incorporated in section 3 further in order to account the effect of airblast atomization mechanism on the maintenance time and avoid the effects of different materials of make for the atomizers the conventional airblast atomizer was operated with closed auxiliary air outlets outlet 3 in fig 1 mimicking both atomization configurations viz i the conventional airblast atomization air annulus outlet 2 around saline jet outlet 1 and ii the liquid film airblast atomization saline annulus outlet 2 around air jet outlet 1 atomizer fouling was compared in the conventional atomizer operated in stated two modes and the perforated plate atomizer at similar operating conditions same air mass flux saline mass flow rate and alr 35 5 g cm2s of air at 175 c was used to atomize 2 g s saline at 65 c with 100 000 ppm tds maintaining alr 2 properties of saline for different temperatures and salinities are mentioned in table 4 spray cone angle and air mass flux as air passes through a single outlet were monitored to evaluate the atomizer performance over time while in the conventional atomization the air orifice was fouled impending the air flow and started producing water jets after 1 5 h a complete suppression of fouling was demonstrated over 14 h of operation in liquid film atomization saline annulus around air jet 1 2 uncertainly analysis uncertainty in sensor reading contributes to total error in measured parameters uncertainties were collected from datasheets for each measurement device and combined with uncertainty due to repeatability from three repeatability tests using uncertainty propagation analysis coleman and steele 1995 to estimate overall error in parameters of interest as summarized in table 5 2 result and discussion first this section describes the effect of fouling on the atomizer performance over time in terms of the spray cone angle for the perforated plate atomizer ppa and the conventional airblast atomizer caa later atomizer fouling in case of novel liquid film atomization and the conventional airblast atomization is presented at elevated operating temperatures and salinity along with the perforated plate atomizer fouling 2 1 perforated plate versus conventional airblast atomizer test conditions m a 30 5 g cm2s and m s 2 g s the perforated plate atomizer demonstrated near complete suppression of atomizer fouling via maintaining a saline annulus around the air jet and no significant change was observed in the spray cone angle over 2 h blue in figs 4 and 5 the saline annulus film acts as a blanket on the atomizer surface and prevents direct contact with spray this prevents any accumulation of salts on the atomizer surface around the air outlet more details on the atomization mechanism are presented in our previous publication sharma et al 2021 and thus the atomizer fouling however minimal fouling was seen a few millimeters upstream inside the air outlet it might be due to secretion of saline inside the air outlet under the influence of capillary flow liu et al 2011 knowingly pa12 mf has a rough surface r a 16 μ m the saline annulus film dissolves the fouling up to a few millimeters upstream inside the air outlet due to concentration gradient hong et al 2002 and thus inhibits self cleaning in the perforated plate atomizer the spray cone angle slightly increased for 100 000 ppm on increasing salinity 28 1ᵒ for 0 ppm 27 5ᵒ for 35 000 ppm and 30 4ᵒ for 100 000 ppm and so did minimal fouling inside the air outlet increase in spray cone angle after 35 000 ppm was due to increase in saline viscosity for higher salinity davanlou et al 2015 increasing salinity increases the fouling rate but deteriorates the rate of self cleaning leading to larger fouling size however fouling inside the air outlet did not affect the atomizer performance spray cone angle over time and could be further reduced by surface smoothening to prevent capillary flow of saline in case of the conventional airblast atomizer the spray cone angle remained steady over time for 0 ppm but it increased for 35 000 ppm and 100 000 ppm dissolved salts precipitate as the vigorous mixing of air and saline causes significant evaporation of water it leads to atomizer fouling and gradual salt buildup with time as evident from the atomizer pictures shown in fig 5 at intervals of 30 minu salt buildups mainly occurred around the air outlets outlet 2 and 3 not the saline outlet at the center outlet 1 first these results suggest that fouling due to the atomization process is the dominant mechanism compared to the fouling due to saline flow through the center second fast moving air jets exert venturi suction in the vicinity of air outlets generating low pressure regions this results in localized evaporation and salt accumulation around the air outlets giving rise to the nucleation of salt buildup as shown in fig 5 the fact that the salt particles are not blown away and rather stick to the surface proves that they are drawn to the atomizer surface via venturi suction therefore in case of the perforated plate atomizer where a saline annulus maintained around the air outlet not only prevents the direct contact of the atomizer surface and spray but must suppresses the venturi suction induced low pressure regions for near complete suppression of the fouling further in the conventional airblast atomizer larger salt buildups were observed in case of 100 000 ppm due to higher salt concentration giving rise to more salt accumulation around the air outlets accordingly larger fluctuations were observed in the spray cone angle for 100 000 ppm 44 to 67 in comparison to 35 000 ppm 44 to 57 as shown in fig 4 test conditions m a 30 5 g cm2s and alr 2 fig 6 shows variation of the spray cone angle and corresponding atomizer orifice pictures are shown in fig 7 over the duration of 2 h as expected higher saline mass flow rate from 2 0 g s to 5 0 g s in order to maintain same alr resulted in increased atomizer fouling increasing the spray cone angle fluctuation to 44 to 76 for 35 000 ppm and 44 to 91 for 100 000 ppm accordingly operating both atomizers at similar atomization condition severe the fouling in the conventional airblast atomizer in comparison to the perforated plate atomizer demonstrating near complete suppression of fouling the results presented above show severe fouling in the conventional airblast atomizer due to the accumulation of salt in the low pressure regions around the air outlets presence of fast moving air as the outer layer of spray promotes atomizer fouling accordingly a detailed literature review was performed on the airblast atomizers and it was found that air as the outer layer of spray is the conventional way of airblast atomization in both plain jet atomizers lorenzetto and lefebvre 1977 urbán et al 2020 jin et al 2021 and prefilming atomizers sattelmayer and wittig 1986 roudini and wozniak 2018 chaussonnet et al 2020 which is prone to severe fouling on the other hand the perforated plate atomizer needed less air for atomization and remarkably suppressed fouling with the help of a novel liquid film airblast atomization mechanism the perforated plate atomizer ensures the maximum practical vertical relative velocity between air and liquid streams and suppresses low pressure region around the air outlet by maintaining saline annulus film around the air orifice or air jet minimal fouling inside the air outlet did not affect the spray cone angle over 2 h as summarized in table 6 and could be reduced by surface smoothening further open surface design and easy manufacturing additive as well as subtractive allows us to incorporate multiple air orifices in single perforated plate atomizer to accommodate larger saline mass flow rates and achieve larger spray distribution area different material of make for both atomizers can also contribute to the fouling behavior discrepancy to an extent in order to eliminate the effect of material properties on atomizer fouling in current study teng et al 2017 auxiliary air outlets 3 in fig 1 were closed and the conventional airblast atomizer was operated with both conventional plain jet airblast atomization mechanism air annulus around saline jet and liquid film airblast atomization saline annulus around saline jet and is presented next 2 2 liquid film versus conventional plain jet airblast atomization test conditions m a 35 5 g cm2s m s 2 g s and alr 2 the conventional airblast atomizer was operated with closed auxiliary air passes outlet 3 in fig 1 and two air saline orientations air annulus outlet 2 around saline jet outlet 1 as in the conventional airblast atomization and saline annulus outlet 2 around air jet outlet 1 as in the novel liquid film airblast atomization presented in current study air was maintained at 175 c and saline at 65 c with 100 000 ppm tds fig 8 shows the air mass flux for the conventional atomizer operated in two modes conventional and the liquid film atomization and the perforated plate atomizer over time air in the conventional atomization initially dropped for 35 min followed by large fluctuations zoomed in inset in fig 8 and atomizer maintenance was needed the spray cone angle initially increased for 0 5 h and dropped over time due to salt accumulation around the air outlet of atomizer as shown in fig 9 after 0 5 h air started chipping off salt buildups which resulted in large fluctuations in the spray cone angle and air mass flow rate the test had to stop after 1 5 h of operation as the atomizer started generating liquid jets rather than a spray fig 9 as evident fluctuations in air mass flux were maximum in the conventional airblast atomization followed by the perforated plate airblast atomizer and the liquid film airblast atomization while the perforated plate atomizer was able to completely suppress fouling around air outlet and maintain a steady spray cone angle fig 9 minimal fouling inside the air outlet caused fluctuations in air mass flux fig 8 please note that due to secretion of saline inside the air outlet under the influence of capillary flow on rough pa12 mf surface r a 1 6 μ m minimal fouling was seen a few millimeters upstream inside the air outlet as discussed previously overall suppression of fouling resulted in suppression of fluctuations in spray cone angle in comparison to the conventional airblast atomization however the liquid film airblast atomization with saline annulus as expected continuously maintained a steady air mass flux over 14 h of operation with a steady spray cone angle the atomizer pictures in fig 9 shows a complete suppression of atomizer fouling over 14 h while the liquid film atomization suppressed fouling around the air outlet as in the perforated plate atomizer minimal fouling was also completely eliminated due to smoother ss316 surface r a 0 8 μ m suppressing the saline capillary secretion inside the air outlet and higher thermal conductivity of ss316 facilitating heat transfer from air to saline annulus promoting self cleaning of atomizer additionally fouling was reduced on the atomizer body in comparison with the conventional atomization which suggests that suppression of low pressure regions by the liquid film atomization is not only limited to the vicinity of air outlet but also on a larger scale whole atomizer body results also demonstrate that the novel liquid film airblast atomization can be adopted in the conventional atomizers for complete suppression of fouling corrosion was observed on the atomizer body after operating it for 14 h therefore the liquid film atomizer should be made of polymers to avoid corrosion of atomizer body as in current study with smoother surface to avoid fouling due to capillary flow higher thermal conductivity of polymers is an aid to self cleaning via increased heat transfer hence presented work establishes an anti clogging perforated plate atomizer and a benchmark liquid film airblast atomization mechanism for remarkable suppression of fouling in airblast atomizers table 7 summarizes the characteristics of the novel liquid film airblast and the conventional airblast atomization mechanism plain jet and prefilming excellent atomization leading to significant evaporation suppressed fouling reduced maintenance cost open surface design and easy manufacturing cheap make the liquid film airblast atomization as the most suitable and affordable choice among the airblast atomizers for contaminated liquid airblast atomization applications seeking for high evaporation rate such as zld hdh desalination systems powder metallurgy pharmaceuticals and hospitals and spray drying and cooling the perforated plate atomizer in the current design state can operate only in one orientation vertical and spraying up however the design can be modified for other orientations by capping the liquid feeding channels this will ensure liquid supply to the manifold where liquid annulus will be stabilized by air venturi suction dominating gravity effects 3 conclusions current work experimentally investigates the anti clogging potential of the perforated plate airblast atomizer in comparison with the conventional airblast atomizer for high operating temperature and salinity applications root cause of airblast atomizer fouling was described and a benchmark liquid film airblast atomization is established for complete suppression of fouling which can also be implemented in the existing airblast atomizers in sharp contrast to the conventional airblast atomizers plain jet and prefilming wherein air is in the outer layer of the spray in liquid film airblast atomization saline is the outer layer which impedes salt accumulation at the atomizer surface this resulted in complete suppression of fouling steady spray cone angle and air mass flux leading to uniform operation for over 14 h while the conventional airblast atomizer needed to be cleaned after 35 min main outcomes of the present study are outlined below the conventional airblast atomizer faced severe fouling around the air outlet and fluctuations in the spray cone angle for m a 30 5 g cm2s and m s 2 g s 44 to 57 for 35 000 ppm and 44 to 67 for 100 000 ppm and for m a 30 5 g cm2s and alr 2 44 to 76 for 35 000 ppm and 44 to 91 for 100 000 ppm over 2 h at 100 c air and 50 c saline increasing saline mass flow rate severed the conventional airblast atomizer fouling the perforated plate atomizer with liquid film airblast atomization resulted in nearly complete suppression of fouling around the air outlet and a steady spray cone angle 28 1 for 35 000 ppm and 30 1 for 100 000 ppm for both tests same air mass flux and saline mass flow rate and same air mass flux and alr over 2 hours at 100 c air and 50 c saline minimal fouling seen a few millimeters upstream inside the air outlet of the perforated plate atomizer did not affect its performance over time and can be reduced by surface smoothening saline annulus film around the air outlet or air jet also facilitates self cleaning of the atomizer orifice this manuscript establishes a benchmark liquid film airblast atomization mechanism and the perforated plate atomizer for suppressing fouling in airblast atomization they are complimented with excellent atomization significant evaporation uniform spray multiple air outlets in single atomizer suppressed fouling reduced maintenance cost open surface design and easy manufacturing cheap these features make the perforated plate atomizer as the most suitable and affordable choice among the airblast atomizers for zld hdh desalination systems spraying powder metallurgy pharmaceuticals and hospitals and spray drying and cooling future studies can focus on studying the effect of orientation on the perforated plate atomizer operation further the liquid film airblast atomization can be implemented in the existing spray system having conventional airblast

15732,the assessment and control of the real losses from water distribution systems require the accurate estimation of the flow rate from an individual leak as a function of the internal pressure the lack of analytical models able to accurately describe the relationship between the area of the leak and the pressure head is the key problem this paper utilized the linear elastic fracture mechanics lefm theory for thin shells to derive models for both longitudinal and circumferential cracks the models were validated by both finite element fe simulations and laboratory experiments under varying crack and pipe parameters both fluid structure interaction fsi and traditional fe simulations were performed and the results were compared to quantify the effect of leakage hydraulics on leak area in the laboratory experiments an image analysis technology was utilized to measure the leak area and flow rate simultaneously so that the effect of the discharge coefficient could be excluded in addition the leak area was systematically measured under the effect of different parameters the results revealed that the values predicted by the derived models were in good agreement with the experimental and fe simulation values for both types of cracks the lefm theory and the phenomena observed in this study can improve our understanding of the leak behavior and enable the development of effective pressure management strategies for water distribution systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords leak area pressure relationship water distribution systems linear elastic fracture mechanics pressure management crack opening area discharge coefficient 1 introduction leakage in water distribution systems wdss is a severe problem causing not only economic losses but also potential public health risks fox et al 2016a van et al 2017 the relationship between the leakage flow rate of a certain leak and the internal pressure of that pipe plays an important role in leakage management for instance this relationship has been used as the basis of leakage assessment methods leak awareness techniques zhou et al 2019 and pressure management puust et al 2010 conventionally the problem of this relationship can be treated as the steady efflux from an orifice at the bottom of a tank with a constant head in this case the orifice equation which was derived based on the torricelli s law was conventionally used to estimate leakage discharge in wdss 1 q c d a 2 g h where q is the leakage flow rate c d is the discharge coefficient a is the leak area and h is the total head in the tank however since the 1990s numerous field tests and experiments have concluded that the exponent of h is often higher than that predicted by the torricelli equation farley and trow 2005 walski et al 2006 spanning from 0 5 to 2 79 with an average value of 1 15 since the torricelli equation was not able to fit data obtained from the field a power equation was introduced thornton 2003 and recommended by the water losses task force of the international water association 2 q c h n where c denotes the leakage coefficient and n denotes the leakage exponent in eq 2 and in the following h is the difference in the pressure head between the inside and outside of the pipe the abnormality of leakage exponents requires further theoretical clarification this relationship can be affected by the leak hydraulics pipe material behavior soil hydraulics and user demands zyl and clayton 2007 among them the effect of soil on leakage flow pressure remains controversial walski et al 2006 and van zyl et al 2013 believed that the effect of soil on the leakage flow rate can be neglected since the head loss of water in the soil is much less than that at the pipe orifice however fox et al 2017 and latifi et al 2018 observed in their experiments that the leakage discharge was clearly inhibited thus the effect of soil was not taken into consideration in this study the pipe material behavior has been considered to have the strongest effect van zyl and cassa 2014 since the leak area expands with increasing pipe pressure may 1994 proposed a model assuming that the leak area increases linearly with increasing pressure 3 a a 0 d a a 0 m h where a 0 is the initial leak area under zero pressure conditions d a is the change of the leak area due to the internal pressure and m is the head area slope by substituting eq 3 into eq 1 an equation known as the fixed and variable area discharges favad equation can be derived 4 q c d a 0 m h 2 g h the validity of this model was confirmed by cassa et al 2010 who performed a numerical study on pipes with linear elastic behavior subsequently in the 2010s several researchers started to investigate the leak area pressure relationship as a function of the pipe properties and the crack geometry most of these studies focused on the linear elastic behavior of the pipe material de marchis et al 2016 de marchis and milici 2019 franchini and lanza 2014 sadr al sadati and jalili ghazizadeh 2019 van zyl and cassa 2014 van zyl and malde 2017 ferrante 2012 reported elastoplastic behavior on a thin walled steel pipe which indicated that the linear elastic model could fail when the elastic limits of the pipe were exceeded generally the effect of plastic deformation can be included into the initial area a0 which is independent of pressure so it is not considered in this study in other studies cassa et al 2010 van et al 2017 the leak area of circular holes was estimated as nearly independent of pressure and the leak flow rate pressure data were very close to the theoretical values obtained by eq 1 longitudinal cracks have been reported to be the most sensitive with pressure the leak area pressure relationship for circumferential cracks remains controversial de marchis and milici 2019 observed that the head area slope of circumferential cracks was constant under varying pressure cassa et al 2010 concluded that the head area slope of circumferential cracks was relatively small and even negative furthermore studies on pipes made of polymers such as polyethylene pe have reported viscoelastic deformation as well as leakage flow rate with time dependent behavior ferrante 2012 ferrante et al 2011 massari et al 2012 then the viscoelastic behavior was modeled through linear viscoelastic equations as functions of time modeling of viscoelasticity is very complex work nevertheless due to the interference of leakage discharge it has been very difficult to use conventional methods such as crack meters laser scanning or moiré interferometry to measure the leak area experimentally therefore most of these studies were limited to using the effective area a e derived from eq 1 5 a e q 2 g h c d a a e is a valuable variable when evaluating leakage at a district level for it is simple to since the combination of multiply leaks may lead to a totally different leak discharge pressure relationship in global scale compared with a single leak ferrante et al 2014 however for experimental studies the a e contains the effect of c d and thus it can not represent the true area moreover the controversy concerning the relationship between c d and h remains in their experiments fox et al 2017 assumed that the change of c d was negligible while sadr al sadati and jalili ghazizadeh 2019 found that c d was related to the reynolds number re even under full turbulence thus more direct evidence is required to assess the dependence of leak area on pressure in addition to the studies that have used a e several studies have employed finite element fe simulations to estimate the leak area pressure relationship for example cassa and van zyl 2013 simulated the effects of fluid pressure and longitudinal pipe stress by applying internal pressure and external stresses at the pipe ends based on the fe simulation results an empirical model denoted as cassa model in this study was derived able to quantify the pressure dependent leak however this model is dimensionally inconsistent which means that it can be inaccurate when the values of the variables are beyond the range investigated in their study fox et al 2017 derived a linear elastic model denoted as fox model in this study for longitudinal cracks based on fe simulations contrary to the fe simulation by cassa and van zyl 2013 the fluid pressure on the crack face and the residual stress were taken into consideration this model combined with viscoelastic behavior was validated by leak area measurement data obtained directly through an image analysis technique in their previous study fox et al 2016b in general this model is simple and dimensionally homogeneous nevertheless there is still no theoretical basis for the model and the values of the model parameters depend highly on the selected numerical simulation parameters de paola et al 2019 proved through fe simulations that the bending moment induced by the gravity of the water and the pipe could significantly affect the head discharge relationship the fe method enabled those studies to investigate the displacement of cracks under different loads however the flow field variation due to the leakage and the resulting effect on the leak area were not taken into consideration it should be noted that the effects of the bending moment de paola et al 2019 and the residual stress fox et al 2017 can be directly integrated in a leak area model through the inclusion of the initial area thus their effect was not considered in this study in summary while several previous studies have focused on the leakage pressure relationship several problems remain unsolved 1 the leak area was determined by indirect methods the effect of the discharge coefficient should not be excluded 2 due to absence of fe simulations on leak hydraulics the effects of leak flow pressure on crack surface were ignored which may have resulted in additional errors 3 only few studies have focused on circumferential cracks dimensionally consistent analytical models and direct experimental measurements for circumferential cracks are required 4 the derivation of previous analytical models lacks theoretical support in order to develop a dimensionally consistent leak area pressure model both longitudinal and circumferential cracks with sufficient physical meaning this paper employs the linear elastic fracture mechanics lefm theory for thin shells with through wall cracks only linear elastic behavior was considered in this study and a few procedures were taken to minimize the viscoelastic behavior during experiments the accuracy of applying this model for water supply pipes was validated both numerically and experimentally both fluid structure interaction fsi and fe simulations of the pressure dependent leak area were conducted the results of these two fe methods were compared to quantify the effect of crack face loading meanwhile a series of experiments were conducted where leak area pressure a h and leak flow rate head q h data were simultaneously obtained since the leak area can be directly measured in this study the pressure head area slope m was chosen as the indicator instead of leak flow rate for comparing the analytical model with the numerical and experimental results this was because the leak flow rate can be greatly affected by c d which was generally considered as function of reynolds number and geometry of the orifice ski and tomasz 1993 lichtarowicz et al 2006 hobbs and humphreys 1990 finally the discharge coefficient c d in the experiments was calculated eq 1 and its effect on the q h relationship was discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 analytical models based on crack mechanics to obtain a dimensionally consistent leak area pressure model for both longitudinal and circumferential cracks with sufficient physical meaning this paper employs the lefm theory for thin shells with through wall cracks lefm has been often used to estimate the crack opening area coa for nuclear pressurized pipes under the effect of internal pressure ghosh et al 2009 for a pipe subjected to internal pressure the geometric parameters used in this research are defined in fig 1 the mean radius and thickness of the pipe are denoted as r m and t respectively and a is the half crack length for circumferential cracks the corresponding angle of the arc formed on the pipe is 2 θ in addition p denotes the internal pressure and m denotes the global bending moment the tensile stress σ t and the membrane stress σ h in the pipe wall can be respectively obtained by the following relationships ghosh et al 2009 6 σ t r m p 2 t 7 σ h r m p t eq 6 and eq 7 are based on two assumptions firstly t is small compared with r m so that the stress can be considered uniformly distributed over the thickness of the wall secondly the pressure head is far larger than the pipe diameter to ensure that the effect of element head of the water in pipe can be neglected compared with the pressure head the minimum r m t value was 4 85 in this study and the error induced by the wall thickness was acceptable as will be discussed in section 4 the minimum test pressure head was ensured 10 times larger than the pipe diameter and the operating pressure of the water supply pipes in r is generally much greater than the diameter of the pipes therefore the second hypothesis can be guaranteed in this study according to fig 1 the directions of σ t and σ h are longitudinal and circumferential respectively it should be noted that when a uniform pressure is applied to the inner pipe wall it is equivalent to applying corresponding σ t and σ h thus in the numerical simulation there is no need to apply additional longitudinal loads at the pipe ends which was the case in the study by cassa et al 2010 for a body subjected to uniform tensile stress σ the elastic area change can be calculated from the stress intensity factor sif k i a using the following equation takahashi 2002a 8 d a 2 σ e 0 a k i a 2 d a where e is the young s modulus tada et al 1985 used the sif solutions k p reported by sanders 1982 for both longitudinal and circumferential cracks on thin

geometries dimensionless parameters utilized to calculate the sif ensured that the results of the lefm models can be extended to any pipe this is also the advantage of the lefm model compared with the previous empirical models by substituting k t into eq 4 the area change of the cracks can be determined 11 d a 2 σ e 0 a k p 2 d a 2 π r m t σ e g λ where g λ is the integral of f λ along the crack

improved by two parameter models and almost all of these researches focused on circumferential cracks forman et al 1985 klecker et al 1986 lacire et al 1999 takahashi 2002b in this study the klecker model was selected due to its wide range of applications the terms related to the bending moment m were removed since its effect is beyond the scope of this study in the klecker model the area

simulations need to be performed in order to quantify the impact of leak hydraulics and crack face loading on the leak area the fsi simulation method was used to determine the pipe deformation under the effect of the fluid field since the fluid field variations induced by pipe deformation are very small compared to the global flow field characteristics in the pipes their effect on the flow patterns and pressure can be neglected therefore to ensure calculation efficiency only one way fsi simulations were performed in this study i e only the leak area changes induced by the flow field pressure were investigated thus the leakage flow rate calculated in the fsi simulations was not used in the subsequent comparative studies model development and analyses on both the fluid and structural components were conducted in ansys workbench ansys 2019 fig 2 illustrates the 3d geometrical models of the flow domain and the solid structure the ratio between the length of the pipe l and the pipe external diameter d was 10 and proved large enough so that the boundary conditions would not affect the leak behavior both ends of the pipe were fully constrained which resembles the installation conditions of test pipes in laboratory experiments the fluid field was a combination of the flow field inside the pipe and that through the crack the upstream end of the fluid domain was set as velocity inlet and the downstream one as pressure outlet fig 2 the velocity at the inlet was equal to the velocity of the main pipe in the experiments while the pressure of the outlet was the working pressure values listed in table 1 at the crack outlet pressure outlet boundary condition was set with 0 5 mh2o pressure head which was the same as that in the laboratory experiments since the viscoelastic behavior was not considered in this study steady state simulations were performed the turbulence was modeled using a standard k ϵ equation 2 2 2 previous fe simulation method in addition to the fsi simulations the fe method used in a previous study cassa et al 2010 was employed where the water pressure was simulated by applying loads to the structure the main difference between the previous fe simulation method and fsi is that the loading applied in fsi is derived from the flow field simulation results while that applied in conventional fe simulation methods is determined artificially by comparing the results of two simulation methods the effects of leak hydraulics and crack face loading on the leak area can be quantified both the boundary conditions and the calculation methods of the structure behavior in the fe simulation were the same as those in the fsi simulations 2 2 3 sensitivity analysis of numerical simulations in order to verify the accuracy of the analytical model proposed in section 2 1 it is necessary to quantify the impact of a series of parameters on the structural behavior of cracks to this end a sensitivity analysis was conducted where the benchmark values were kept the same while the value of each parameter in table 1 was changed in turn the benchmark values of the parameters are displayed in bold in table 1 since the width of the crack and poisson s ratio has been proved had neglectable effect on leak area cassa and van zyl 2013 fox et al 2017 the effect of 4 parameters was investigated in sensitivity analysis the elastic modulus of the pipe material thickness of pipe external diameter of pipe and the length and of the crack in this study a 40 mm long longitudinal crack on a high density polyethylene hdpe pipe with an external diameter of 90 mm and wall thickness of 5 3 mm l 0 was selected as the benchmark for longitudinal cracks and a circumferential crack c 0 with the same parameters was selected as the benchmark for circumferential cracks in each case both fsi and fe simulations were conducted in each simulation pressure loadings equivalent to the pressure heads of 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 mh2o were implemented the leak area under each pressure was calculated based on the displacement of the crack edge in the structural model consequently the head area slope m was obtained by linear regression of the calculated area 2 3 experimental setup all experiments were conducted in the pipe leakage test laboratory in harbin institute of technology china a schematic of the experimental apparatus used in this study is illustrated in fig 3 a water was supplied from a tank with a capacity of 4 5 m³ through a dn100mm abs acrylonitrile butadine styrene pipe by a variable speed pump the pump could supply water at a speed of 7 l s and a head of 70 m an air vessel was installed downstream of the pipe to stabilize the upstream pressure moreover two air valves were installed both upstream and downstream of the test section to remove the air from the pipe an electromagnetic meter diyuan yyd 100 china with 0 5 accuracy was used to measure and record the flow rate the leakage flow rate was determined by calculating the difference between the upstream and downstream flowmeter readings the leak flow discharge from the test tank was collected in a bucket with a capacity of 17 l the leakage flow rate data were calibrated by simultaneously measuring the leaked water weight and the time through a weight sensor hengyuan hy 021 china with 20 kg full scale fs and 0 05 fs accuracy two manometers kaihang ky2010 with 0 6 mpa fs and 0 2 fs accuracy were utilized to measure the pressure upstream and downstream of the test section the pressure of the test section was obtained as the average of the two manometer readings a replaceable test pipe section with an artificial crack was installed in a tank with 0 5 m³ capacity as depicted in fig 3b one side of this tank was transparent in order to facilitate the leak area measurements on the other side of the tank a 0 6 m high overflow weir was installed the test pipe section was installed horizontally facing the transparent side of the tank the length of the test sections was 0 5 m the average height of the leak on the test section with respect to the bottom of the test tank was 0 1 m so that the external water pressure head could be stabilized at 0 5 m images of the laboratory and the test tank are presented in figs s1 and s2 respectively similar to the procedure reported by van zyl and malde 2017 the pressure of the test section was increased and decreased in a stepwise manner each test step lasted about 30 s and was proved to be long enough for the flow and pressure data to be stabilized the data collected by the weight sensor flow meter and manometers were recorded simultaneously by a computer at a frequency of 1 hz the objective of the experiment was to simultaneously acquire data concerning the leak area pressure head a h and leak flow rate pressure q h image analysis methods similar to those used in fox et al 2016b were adopted to measure the area under the effect of leakage flow images of the cracks were recorded using a camera with a resolution of 48 mp the external surface around the crack was painted with waterproof red paint to provide a clear distinction line between the red pipe surface and the black leak area under the effect of leak discharge white in the image subsequently an image processing procedure was followed to separate the leak area from the pipe edges based on the rgb value of the pixels the initial length and average width of the crack on each test section were measured using a vernier caliper with an accuracy of 0 1 mm before each experiment a ruler with known length and width was photographed with the camera in order to calibrate the ratio between pixel size and actual size under each pressure level three images were recorded and the leak area value was the average of the three measurements due to the complex procedures involved in the image analysis methods adopted in this study the leak area was recorded every 5 mh2o to minimize the effect of viscoelastic behaviors of pipes after each test step the pump would turn off for 1 min to provide enough time for pipe material recovery once the total time of an experiment run exceeded 2700s the experiment would be terminated and restarted after at least 4 h in this way in one experiment run the total pressurized time would not exceed 900 s in addition an additional experiment was carried out on test section l 0 to examine the viscoelastic effect within 900 s in this experiment the pressure was maintained at 50 mh2o for 900 s the leak area was recorded at 0 s 300 s 600 s and 900 s as shown in fig s6 no significant change was observed furthermore the wetted perimeter of the crack outlet section χ was measured through the image analysis method by combining the measured leak area and flow rate the reynolds number of the crack outlet section under different pressures can be determined the derivation of the equation used to calculate re is available in the supplementary material the benchmark values used in the sensitivity analysis of the experiments were the same as those of the simulations the properties of the manufactured test sections and the corresponding experimental results are listed in table 2 compared with previous experimental studies a polypropylene random copolymer ppr pipe was included due to its wide application in building water supply systems and small water distribution networks in addition the area measured through image analysis was the projected area perpendicular to the pipe length which could lead to a certain error when compared with the actual leak area the error induced by projection can be neglected for longitudinal cracks since it mainly occurs in the circumferential direction and the circumferential width of longitudinal cracks is negligible compared to the pipe diameter for circumferential cracks a series of measures were taken to minimize the measurement error 1 the length of most cracks was relatively short compared to the pipe diameter ensuring that the bending caused by the outer radian of the pipe would not affect the area significantly 2 the photographed leak area was divided into several parts along the length direction and the area of each part was multiplied by a bending coefficient based on the geometric parameters to correct the error induced by the radian 3 results 3 1 fe simulation results taking the longitudinal crack l 0 as an example the flow field simulation results when the internal pressure was 40 mh2o are displayed in fig 4 as it can be observed in fig 4a the flow velocity in most of the main pipe remained unaffected while the water flow velocity at the crack opening was significantly higher the average velocity at the center of the crack outlet section was 25 63 m s which was very close to the value predicted by the torricelli equation of 27 82 m s the water pressure variations in the pipe and the crack surface due to the velocity changes are displayed in fig 4b the pressure within the pipe was not affected by the leak flow the pressure at the outlet section of the crack was 0 47 mh2o which was very close to the pressure of the surrounding media 0 5 mh2o the flow velocity upstream of the crack was slightly higher than that downstream of the crack the water pressure on the crack surface was very low and even a negative pressure zone was observed different from the estimates reported in previous studies the average pressure on the crack surface was 1 16 lower than the pipe internal pressure this indicates that the crack surface pressure may inhibit the expansion of the crack taking the l 0 case as an example the crack edge displacement vs crack length curves obtained by both the fsi and previous fe simulation methods by cassa et al 2010 at pressures of 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 mh2o are presented in fig 5 it can be observed that the displacement of the middle part of the crack was the largest while that of the two sides was the smallest which was consistent with the prediction by the lefm based models the shape of deformed circumferential cracks is similar to that of longitudinal cracks which is consistent with the findings of previous fe simulation based studies cassa and van zyl 2013 the area obtained by the fsi simulations was averagely 1 2 smaller than that obtained by the fe simulations the leak area variation was calculated by the edge displacement integral the head area slope was obtained by linear regression of the areas calculated under different pressures 3 2 experimental results the data of the leak area and the leakage flow rate under different pressures are summarized in figs 7 and 8 leak exponents were obtained by fitting the leakage flow rate pressure data into eq 2 the geometric parameters of cracks and pipes the measured leak exponents and the head area slopes m of all test sections are summarized in table 2 the leak exponent of most test pipe sections was larger than 0 5 while that of a few circumferential and longitudinal cracks on steel pipe and the 10 3 mm thick ppr pipe was lower than 0 5 under the same conditions the leak exponent of longitudinal cracks was generally larger than that of circumferential cracks which was consistent with the observations of previous studies cassa et al 2010 to illustrate the effect of changing different parameters on the leak area examples of images of the leak areas of different test sections under the pressures of 0 and 40 mh2o are depicted in fig 6 it can be observed that the expansion of cracks at the center was larger than that on both sides which is consistent with the fe simulation results it is worth noting that while their diameter was the same the wall thickness of pipes made of different materials was different consequently it cannot be completely guaranteed that all the other variables are the same when the effect of elastic modulus on leak area is investigated the relationship between the discharge coefficient c d and the reynolds number re of each test section can be calculated as shown in figs 11 in the laminar and traditional flow region of most test pipes c d was positively related to re while in the turbulent region c d decreased with increasing re this means that c d might be negatively correlated with pressure under the actual working conditions of the wdss this is consistent with the models by idelchik 1987 3 3 sensitivity analysis results in the sensitivity analysis study the crack length pipe diameter pipe wall thickness and elastic modulus were changed in turn keeping all the other factors the same as benchmark values the main experimental and fe simulation results as well as the predicted values by the fox klecker tada paris and cassa models are displayed in figs 9 and 10 demonstrating how each single geometric parameter affects the head area slope m the crack length and pipe diameter were found to be positively correlated with m while the wall thickness and young s modulus were negatively correlated with m the crack length appeared to have the greatest effect on m the values of m calculated by the fe simulations were generally higher than the experimental ones for both types of cracks the values of m predicted by the fsi simulations were averagely 1 2 higher than those predicted by the fe simulations in addition the m values predicted by the tada paris tada et al 1985 and klecker models klecker et al 1986 introduced in this study were compared with those predicted by the fox and cassa models introduced by fox et al 2017 and cassa and van zyl 2013 respectively for longitudinal cracks the tada paris l fox and cassa models successfully predicted the general trend of the effect of each parameter on m the m value predicted by the tada paris l model was closer to the experimental and simulation values while the fox model had a relatively high accuracy it overestimated the effect of pipe diameter for circumferential cracks the m values predicted by the klecker and tada paris c models were similar while those predicted by the cassa model had a relatively large deviation from the values of both models the numerical and experimental results of this study revealed that the m of circumferential cracks was much larger than that predicted by the cassa model furthermore no negative m values were observed in this study in general it is difficult to keep the wall thickness constant when the diameter varies or different materials are used in the experiments consequently a few unavoidable deviations can be observed between the experimentally measured and predicted values of m nevertheless this does not affect the evaluation of model accuracy since the predicted values of the model were relatively close to the experimental ones after modifying the pipe wall thickness according to the actual size of the test pipe used in the experiments 4 discussion the numerical simulation of the flow in the pipe fluid domain is helpful to expand the knowledge of the effect of leakage hydraulics on cracks on the one hand the fsi results regarding the computational fluid dynamics revealed that the effect of the leakage flow at the crack on the flow regime and pressure of the main pipe was very small and can be neglected this indicates that the difference between the fsi and fe simulation results can be mainly attributed to the crack face loading nevertheless due to the lack of means to directly measure the crack face loading experimentally under the existing technical conditions the computational fluid dynamics results can provide reliable reference values regarding crack face loading the fsi simulation results demonstrated that the average crack face loading value was negative which means that the leakage discharge could restrain the expansion of the leak area this phenomenon can be explained by analyzing the pressure and velocity fields obtained by simulation of the fluid domain according to fig 4 the pressure of the outlet section of the crack was very close to the pressure of the surrounding media this means that the potential energy of the water pressure is all converted into kinetic energy the streamlines in fig 4a indicate that due to the abrupt change of the flow section a small eddy current appeared near the crack inlet thus the average velocity at the cross section near the entrance was higher than that at the outlet resulting in a negative pressure near the entrance however compared with the internal pressure the overall magnitude of the negative pressure was relatively small since the results of crack face loading by fsi simulation can t be experimentally measured through current technology the effect of crack surface cannot be used to calibrate the coefficient of the lefm based model an important result of this study was that the values predicted by the lefm based model agreed well with the experimental and fe simulation results for both types of cracks in addition the lefm theory helped to understand the relationship between leak area and pressure for fully submerged water pipes according to the lefm theory the stress perpendicular to the crack length has a decisive effect on the leak area that is the circumferential stress σ h determines the area of longitudinal cracks while the longitudinal tensile stress σ t determines the area of circumferential cracks this is also consistent with the phenomenon observed by cassa et al 2010 in their study while the application of additional tensile stress at both ends of the pipe had negligible effect on the leak area of longitudinal crack the effect on the leak area of circumferential crack was significant this explains why the m of longitudinal cracks is larger than that of circumferential cracks first according to eqs 6 and 7 the circumferential stress of pressurized pipes is twice the longitudinal stress therefore as analyzed above the dominating stress of longitudinal cracks is larger than that of circumferential cracks second the stress intensity factor of longitudinal cracks derived by tada et al 1985 is generally larger than that of circumferential cracks the lefm based model emphasized the effects of dominant parameters crack length pipe diameter wall thickness pressure head and elastic modulus and ignored the effect of the initial crack width this is consistent with previous studies fox et al 2017 cassa and van zyl 2013 these dominant parameters were used in dimensionless form in the present model λ θ π r m t g h e the geometric parameters λ θ π r m t reflect the relative size of the crack with respect to the pipe while g h e reflects the relative pressure moreover the sensitivity analysis results highlighted the necessity of introducing the fracture mechanics theory i e without theoretical support the accuracy of the model derived from fe simulations would be extremely dependent on the range of the selected parameters for instance although the fox model is dimensionally consistent an obvious deviation between the predicted and experimental values occurred when l 30 mm t 5 4 and d 150 by contrast the tada paris and kelcker models maintained a relatively high accuracy over a wider range of parameter values in addition although the tada paris model was derived for thin wall pipes r m t 10 the results in this study showed the relative error between fe simulation results experimental results and was acceptable for example the minimum r m t value was 4 85 in test l4 1 and c4 1 the relative errors between the predicted and experimental values were still less than 10 for circumferential cracks the deviation between numerical and experimental results with regard to the values of m in this study and previous studies can be attributed to the effects of the boundary conditions and the discharge coefficients the boundary conditions in the fe simulations in this study were consistent with those in the study by fox et al 2017 thus the difference between the fe simulation results and the fox model was relatively small on the other hand the boundary conditions in cassa and van zyl 2013 assumed that no deformation occurs at the end of the pipe opposite to the crack which may affect the displacement of the crack edges as for the experiments two interesting phenomena about the relationship between c d and re can be observed as shown in fig 11 firstly the measured c d of different test sections showed relatively large difference under the same re ranging from 0 5 to 0 8 this can be explained by the variation of the geometry parameters of the test sections the c d in orifice equation which represents the combined influence of flow contraction and head loss in orifice can be greatly affected by geometry parameters and the roundness of the orifice edge ali and foss 2015 ski and tomasz 1993 lichtarowicz et al 2006 for example research by lichtarowicz et al 2006 showed that changing the ratio between length and diameter of the orifice can led c d to varied from 0 6 to 0 82 under the same re secondly for most of the test sections c d decreased with re in fully turbulence regime this was consistent with the conclusions by idelchik 1987 readerharris et al 1995 furthermore this explains the phenomenon observed in the experiments that the m value of the longitudinal cracks and a few circumferential cracks on steel pipe was larger than 0 but its leak exponent was less than 0 5 according to eq 5 for cracks with small m the effect of the increase of the leak area on the leakage flow is weaker than that of the decrease of the c d thus the leakage exponent was less than 0 5 this also indicates that the leak exponent calculated solely based on q h data cannot effectively represent the leak area variation with pressure it is worth mentioning that although the relative contributions of c d and a on leakage discharge pressure relationship was successfully separated through laboratory experiments in this study the role of the effective area is still irreplaceable in practical applications due to the complexity of field tests the proposed model offers potential benefits for the evaluation and management of leakage in wdss to develop more accurate leakage models further work is needed to explore the interaction between pipe and surrounding medium as well as the effects on the leakage hydraulics 5 conclusions in order to develop analytical models able to describe the leak area pressure relationship for both longitudinal and circumferential cracks the theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics lefm for thin shells was employed and the derived models were validated both numerically and experimentally the results demonstrated that the values predicted by the model were in good agreement with the experimental and fe simulation results for both types of cracks in addition the numerical simulation and experimental results revealed that the pressure of the leakage flow at the crack surface was negative however when compared with the magnitude of the pipe internal pressure its effect can be neglected for most test pipes the discharge coefficient c d decreased with increasing reynolds number in the fully turbulent regime which indicated that c d is negatively correlated with the pressure under the actual working conditions of the wdss the pressure head area slopes of all circumferential cracks investigated in this study were positive the fact that the leak exponent was less than 0 5 was attributed to that the effect of the decrease of c d on the leak flow rate was stronger than that of the area expansion the linear elastic model derived in this study can be used as a reference to evaluate the leakage flow pressure relationship of pipe network systems thus contributing to the development of pressure

15732,the assessment and control of the real losses from water distribution systems require the accurate estimation of the flow rate from an individual leak as a function of the internal pressure the lack of analytical models able to accurately describe the relationship between the area of the leak and the pressure head is the key problem this paper utilized the linear elastic fracture mechanics lefm theory for thin shells to derive models for both longitudinal and circumferential cracks the models were validated by both finite element fe simulations and laboratory experiments under varying crack and pipe parameters both fluid structure interaction fsi and traditional fe simulations were performed and the results were compared to quantify the effect of leakage hydraulics on leak area in the laboratory experiments an image analysis technology was utilized to measure the leak area and flow rate simultaneously so that the effect of the discharge coefficient could be excluded in addition the leak area was systematically measured under the effect of different parameters the results revealed that the values predicted by the derived models were in good agreement with the experimental and fe simulation values for both types of cracks the lefm theory and the phenomena observed in this study can improve our understanding of the leak behavior and enable the development of effective pressure management strategies for water distribution systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords leak area pressure relationship water distribution systems linear elastic fracture mechanics pressure management crack opening area discharge coefficient 1 introduction leakage in water distribution systems wdss is a severe problem causing not only economic losses but also potential public health risks fox et al 2016a van et al 2017 the relationship between the leakage flow rate of a certain leak and the internal pressure of that pipe plays an important role in leakage management for instance this relationship has been used as the basis of leakage assessment methods leak awareness techniques zhou et al 2019 and pressure management puust et al 2010 conventionally the problem of this relationship can be treated as the steady efflux from an orifice at the bottom of a tank with a constant head in this case the orifice equation which was derived based on the torricelli s law was conventionally used to estimate leakage discharge in wdss 1 q c d a 2 g h where q is the leakage flow rate c d is the discharge coefficient a is the leak area and h is the total head in the tank however since the 1990s numerous field tests and experiments have concluded that the exponent of h is often higher than that predicted by the torricelli equation farley and trow 2005 walski et al 2006 spanning from 0 5 to 2 79 with an average value of 1 15 since the torricelli equation was not able to fit data obtained from the field a power equation was introduced thornton 2003 and recommended by the water losses task force of the international water association 2 q c h n where c denotes the leakage coefficient and n denotes the leakage exponent in eq 2 and in the following h is the difference in the pressure head between the inside and outside of the pipe the abnormality of leakage exponents requires further theoretical clarification this relationship can be affected by the leak hydraulics pipe material behavior soil hydraulics and user demands zyl and clayton 2007 among them the effect of soil on leakage flow pressure remains controversial walski et al 2006 and van zyl et al 2013 believed that the effect of soil on the leakage flow rate can be neglected since the head loss of water in the soil is much less than that at the pipe orifice however fox et al 2017 and latifi et al 2018 observed in their experiments that the leakage discharge was clearly inhibited thus the effect of soil was not taken into consideration in this study the pipe material behavior has been considered to have the strongest effect van zyl and cassa 2014 since the leak area expands with increasing pipe pressure may 1994 proposed a model assuming that the leak area increases linearly with increasing pressure 3 a a 0 d a a 0 m h where a 0 is the initial leak area under zero pressure conditions d a is the change of the leak area due to the internal pressure and m is the head area slope by substituting eq 3 into eq 1 an equation known as the fixed and variable area discharges favad equation can be derived 4 q c d a 0 m h 2 g h the validity of this model was confirmed by cassa et al 2010 who performed a numerical study on pipes with linear elastic behavior subsequently in the 2010s several researchers started to investigate the leak area pressure relationship as a function of the pipe properties and the crack geometry most of these studies focused on the linear elastic behavior of the pipe material de marchis et al 2016 de marchis and milici 2019 franchini and lanza 2014 sadr al sadati and jalili ghazizadeh 2019 van zyl and cassa 2014 van zyl and malde 2017 ferrante 2012 reported elastoplastic behavior on a thin walled steel pipe which indicated that the linear elastic model could fail when the elastic limits of the pipe were exceeded generally the effect of plastic deformation can be included into the initial area a0 which is independent of pressure so it is not considered in this study in other studies cassa et al 2010 van et al 2017 the leak area of circular holes was estimated as nearly independent of pressure and the leak flow rate pressure data were very close to the theoretical values obtained by eq 1 longitudinal cracks have been reported to be the most sensitive with pressure the leak area pressure relationship for circumferential cracks remains controversial de marchis and milici 2019 observed that the head area slope of circumferential cracks was constant under varying pressure cassa et al 2010 concluded that the head area slope of circumferential cracks was relatively small and even negative furthermore studies on pipes made of polymers such as polyethylene pe have reported viscoelastic deformation as well as leakage flow rate with time dependent behavior ferrante 2012 ferrante et al 2011 massari et al 2012 then the viscoelastic behavior was modeled through linear viscoelastic equations as functions of time modeling of viscoelasticity is very complex work nevertheless due to the interference of leakage discharge it has been very difficult to use conventional methods such as crack meters laser scanning or moiré interferometry to measure the leak area experimentally therefore most of these studies were limited to using the effective area a e derived from eq 1 5 a e q 2 g h c d a a e is a valuable variable when evaluating leakage at a district level for it is simple to since the combination of multiply leaks may lead to a totally different leak discharge pressure relationship in global scale compared with a single leak ferrante et al 2014 however for experimental studies the a e contains the effect of c d and thus it can not represent the true area moreover the controversy concerning the relationship between c d and h remains in their experiments fox et al 2017 assumed that the change of c d was negligible while sadr al sadati and jalili ghazizadeh 2019 found that c d was related to the reynolds number re even under full turbulence thus more direct evidence is required to assess the dependence of leak area on pressure in addition to the studies that have used a e several studies have employed finite element fe simulations to estimate the leak area pressure relationship for example cassa and van zyl 2013 simulated the effects of fluid pressure and longitudinal pipe stress by applying internal pressure and external stresses at the pipe ends based on the fe simulation results an empirical model denoted as cassa model in this study was derived able to quantify the pressure dependent leak however this model is dimensionally inconsistent which means that it can be inaccurate when the values of the variables are beyond the range investigated in their study fox et al 2017 derived a linear elastic model denoted as fox model in this study for longitudinal cracks based on fe simulations contrary to the fe simulation by cassa and van zyl 2013 the fluid pressure on the crack face and the residual stress were taken into consideration this model combined with viscoelastic behavior was validated by leak area measurement data obtained directly through an image analysis technique in their previous study fox et al 2016b in general this model is simple and dimensionally homogeneous nevertheless there is still no theoretical basis for the model and the values of the model parameters depend highly on the selected numerical simulation parameters de paola et al 2019 proved through fe simulations that the bending moment induced by the gravity of the water and the pipe could significantly affect the head discharge relationship the fe method enabled those studies to investigate the displacement of cracks under different loads however the flow field variation due to the leakage and the resulting effect on the leak area were not taken into consideration it should be noted that the effects of the bending moment de paola et al 2019 and the residual stress fox et al 2017 can be directly integrated in a leak area model through the inclusion of the initial area thus their effect was not considered in this study in summary while several previous studies have focused on the leakage pressure relationship several problems remain unsolved 1 the leak area was determined by indirect methods the effect of the discharge coefficient should not be excluded 2 due to absence of fe simulations on leak hydraulics the effects of leak flow pressure on crack surface were ignored which may have resulted in additional errors 3 only few studies have focused on circumferential cracks dimensionally consistent analytical models and direct experimental measurements for circumferential cracks are required 4 the derivation of previous analytical models lacks theoretical support in order to develop a dimensionally consistent leak area pressure model both longitudinal and circumferential cracks with sufficient physical meaning this paper employs the linear elastic fracture mechanics lefm theory for thin shells with through wall cracks only linear elastic behavior was considered in this study and a few procedures were taken to minimize the viscoelastic behavior during experiments the accuracy of applying this model for water supply pipes was validated both numerically and experimentally both fluid structure interaction fsi and fe simulations of the pressure dependent leak area were conducted the results of these two fe methods were compared to quantify the effect of crack face loading meanwhile a series of experiments were conducted where leak area pressure a h and leak flow rate head q h data were simultaneously obtained since the leak area can be directly measured in this study the pressure head area slope m was chosen as the indicator instead of leak flow rate for comparing the analytical model with the numerical and experimental results this was because the leak flow rate can be greatly affected by c d which was generally considered as function of reynolds number and geometry of the orifice ski and tomasz 1993 lichtarowicz et al 2006 hobbs and humphreys 1990 finally the discharge coefficient c d in the experiments was calculated eq 1 and its effect on the q h relationship was discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 analytical models based on crack mechanics to obtain a dimensionally consistent leak area pressure model for both longitudinal and circumferential cracks with sufficient physical meaning this paper employs the lefm theory for thin shells with through wall cracks lefm has been often used to estimate the crack opening area coa for nuclear pressurized pipes under the effect of internal pressure ghosh et al 2009 for a pipe subjected to internal pressure the geometric parameters used in this research are defined in fig 1 the mean radius and thickness of the pipe are denoted as r m and t respectively and a is the half crack length for circumferential cracks the corresponding angle of the arc formed on the pipe is 2 θ in addition p denotes the internal pressure and m denotes the global bending moment the tensile stress σ t and the membrane stress σ h in the pipe wall can be respectively obtained by the following relationships ghosh et al 2009 6 σ t r m p 2 t 7 σ h r m p t eq 6 and eq 7 are based on two assumptions firstly t is small compared with r m so that the stress can be considered uniformly distributed over the thickness of the wall secondly the pressure head is far larger than the pipe diameter to ensure that the effect of element head of the water in pipe can be neglected compared with the pressure head the minimum r m t value was 4 85 in this study and the error induced by the wall thickness was acceptable as will be discussed in section 4 the minimum test pressure head was ensured 10 times larger than the pipe diameter and the operating pressure of the water supply pipes in r is generally much greater than the diameter of the pipes therefore the second hypothesis can be guaranteed in this study according to fig 1 the directions of σ t and σ h are longitudinal and circumferential respectively it should be noted that when a uniform pressure is applied to the inner pipe wall it is equivalent to applying corresponding σ t and σ h thus in the numerical simulation there is no need to apply additional longitudinal loads at the pipe ends which was the case in the study by cassa et al 2010 for a body subjected to uniform tensile stress σ the elastic area change can be calculated from the stress intensity factor sif k i a using the following equation takahashi 2002a 8 d a 2 σ e 0 a k i a 2 d a where e is the young s modulus tada et al 1985 used the sif solutions k p reported by sanders 1982 for both longitudinal and circumferential cracks on thin shells the solutions are functions of a single geometric parameter i e λ 9 k p σ π a f λ 10 λ a r m t where f λ is the bulging factor for thin shells in polynomial form related to the crack and shell geometries dimensionless parameters utilized to calculate the sif ensured that the results of the lefm models can be extended to any pipe this is also the advantage of the lefm model compared with the previous empirical models by substituting k t into eq 4 the area change of the cracks can be determined 11 d a 2 σ e 0 a k p 2 d a 2 π r m t σ e g λ where g λ is the integral of f λ along the crack

improved by two parameter models and almost all of these researches focused on circumferential cracks forman et al 1985 klecker et al 1986 lacire et al 1999 takahashi 2002b in this study the klecker model was selected due to its wide range of applications the terms related to the bending moment m were removed since its effect is beyond the scope of this study in the klecker model the area pressure relationship for circumferential cracks can be obtained as follows 16 d a c 2 π a 2 α k g h e where α k is a polynomial function of θ π r m t which are geometric factors of the crack and the

simulations need to be performed in order to quantify the impact of leak hydraulics and crack face loading on the leak area the fsi simulation method was used to determine the pipe deformation under the effect of the fluid field since the fluid field variations induced by pipe deformation are very small compared to the global flow field characteristics in the pipes their effect on the flow patterns and pressure can be neglected therefore to ensure calculation efficiency only one way fsi simulations were performed in this study i e only the leak area changes induced by the flow field pressure were investigated thus the leakage flow rate calculated in the fsi simulations was not used in the subsequent comparative studies model development and analyses on both the fluid and structural components were conducted in ansys workbench ansys 2019 fig 2 illustrates the 3d geometrical models of the flow domain and the solid structure the ratio between the length of the pipe l and the pipe external diameter d was 10 and proved large enough so that the boundary conditions would not affect the leak behavior both ends of the pipe were fully constrained which resembles the installation conditions of test pipes in laboratory experiments the fluid field was a combination of the flow field inside the pipe and that through the crack the upstream end of the fluid domain was set as velocity inlet and the downstream one as pressure outlet fig 2 the velocity at the inlet was equal to the velocity of the main pipe in the experiments while the pressure of the outlet was the working pressure values listed in table 1 at the crack outlet pressure outlet boundary condition was set with 0 5 mh2o pressure head which was the same as that in the laboratory experiments since the viscoelastic behavior was not considered in this study steady state simulations were performed the turbulence was modeled using a standard k ϵ equation 2 2 2 previous fe simulation method in addition to the fsi simulations the fe method used in a previous study cassa et al 2010 was employed where the water pressure was simulated by applying loads to the structure the main difference between the previous fe simulation method and fsi is that the loading applied in fsi is derived from the flow field simulation results while that applied in conventional fe simulation methods is determined artificially by comparing the results of two simulation methods the effects of leak hydraulics and crack face loading on the leak area can be quantified both the boundary conditions and the calculation methods of the structure behavior in the fe simulation were the same as those in the fsi simulations 2 2 3 sensitivity analysis of numerical simulations in order to verify the accuracy of the analytical model proposed in section 2 1 it is necessary to quantify the impact of a series of parameters on the structural behavior of cracks to this end a sensitivity analysis was conducted where the benchmark values were kept the same while the value of each parameter in table 1 was changed in turn the benchmark values of the parameters are displayed in bold in table 1 since the width of the crack and poisson s ratio has been proved had neglectable effect on leak area cassa and van zyl 2013 fox et al 2017 the effect of 4 parameters was investigated in sensitivity analysis the elastic modulus of the pipe material thickness of pipe external diameter of pipe and the length and of the crack in this study a 40 mm long longitudinal crack on a high density polyethylene hdpe pipe with an external diameter of 90 mm and wall thickness of 5 3 mm l 0 was selected as the benchmark for longitudinal cracks and a circumferential crack c 0 with the same parameters was selected as the benchmark for circumferential cracks in each case both fsi and fe simulations were conducted in each simulation pressure loadings equivalent to the pressure heads of 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 mh2o were implemented the leak area under each pressure was calculated based on the displacement of the crack edge in the structural model consequently the head area slope m was obtained by linear regression of the calculated area 2 3 experimental setup all experiments were conducted in the pipe leakage test laboratory in harbin institute of technology china a schematic of the experimental apparatus used in this study is illustrated in fig 3 a water was supplied from a tank with a capacity of 4 5 m³ through a dn100mm abs acrylonitrile butadine styrene pipe by a variable speed pump the pump could supply water at a speed of 7 l s and a head of 70 m an air vessel was installed downstream of the pipe to stabilize the upstream pressure moreover two air valves were installed both upstream and downstream of the test section to remove the air from the pipe an electromagnetic meter diyuan yyd 100 china with 0 5 accuracy was used to measure and record the flow rate the leakage flow rate was determined by calculating the difference between the upstream and downstream flowmeter readings the leak flow discharge from the test tank was collected in a bucket with a capacity of 17 l the leakage flow rate data were calibrated by simultaneously measuring the leaked water weight and the time through a weight sensor hengyuan hy 021 china with 20 kg full scale fs and 0 05 fs accuracy two manometers kaihang ky2010 with 0 6 mpa fs and 0 2 fs accuracy were utilized to measure the pressure upstream and downstream of the test section the pressure of the test section was obtained as the average of the two manometer readings a replaceable test pipe section with an artificial crack was installed in a tank with 0 5 m³ capacity as depicted in fig 3b one side of this tank was transparent in order to facilitate the leak area measurements on the other side of the tank a 0 6 m high overflow weir was installed the test pipe section was installed horizontally facing the transparent side of the tank the length of the test sections was 0 5 m the average height of the leak on the test section with respect to the bottom of the test tank was 0 1 m so that the external water pressure head could be stabilized at 0 5 m images of the laboratory and the test tank are presented in figs s1 and s2 respectively similar to the procedure reported by van zyl and malde 2017 the pressure of the test section was increased and decreased in a stepwise manner each test step lasted about 30 s and was proved to be long enough for the flow and pressure data to be stabilized the data collected by the weight sensor flow meter and manometers were recorded simultaneously by a computer at a frequency of 1 hz the objective of the experiment was to simultaneously acquire data concerning the leak area pressure head a h and leak flow rate pressure q h image analysis methods similar to those used in fox et al 2016b were adopted to measure the area under the effect of leakage flow images of the cracks were recorded using a camera with a resolution of 48 mp the external surface around the crack was painted with waterproof red paint to provide a clear distinction line between the red pipe surface and the black leak area under the effect of leak discharge white in the image subsequently an image processing procedure was followed to separate the leak area from the pipe edges based on the rgb value of the pixels the initial length and average width of the crack on each test section were measured using a vernier caliper with an accuracy of 0 1 mm before each experiment a ruler with known length and width was photographed with the camera in order to calibrate the ratio between pixel size and actual size under each pressure level three images were recorded and the leak area value was the average of the three measurements due to the complex procedures involved in the image analysis methods adopted in this study the leak area was recorded every 5 mh2o to minimize the effect of viscoelastic behaviors of pipes after each test step the pump would turn off for 1 min to provide enough time for pipe material recovery once the total time of an experiment run exceeded 2700s the experiment would be terminated and restarted after at least 4 h in this way in one experiment run the total pressurized time would not exceed 900 s in addition an additional experiment was carried out on test section l 0 to examine the viscoelastic effect within 900 s in this experiment the pressure was maintained at 50 mh2o for 900 s the leak area was recorded at 0 s 300 s 600 s and 900 s as shown in fig s6 no significant change was observed furthermore the wetted perimeter of the crack outlet section χ was measured through the image analysis method by combining the measured leak area and flow rate the reynolds number of the crack outlet section under different pressures can be determined the derivation of the equation used to calculate re is available in the supplementary material the benchmark values used in the sensitivity analysis of the experiments were the same as those of the simulations the properties of the manufactured test sections and the corresponding experimental results are listed in table 2 compared with previous experimental studies a polypropylene random copolymer ppr pipe was included due to its wide application in building water supply systems and small water distribution networks in addition the area measured through image analysis was the projected area perpendicular to the pipe length which could lead to a certain error when compared with the actual leak area the error induced by projection can be neglected for longitudinal cracks since it mainly occurs in the circumferential direction and the circumferential width of longitudinal cracks is negligible compared to the pipe diameter for circumferential cracks a series of measures were taken to minimize the measurement error 1 the length of most cracks was relatively short compared to the pipe diameter ensuring that the bending caused by the outer radian of the pipe would not affect the area significantly 2 the photographed leak area was divided into several parts along the length direction and the area of each part was multiplied by a bending coefficient based on the geometric parameters to correct the error induced by the radian 3 results 3 1 fe simulation results taking the longitudinal crack l 0 as an example the flow field simulation results when the internal pressure was 40 mh2o are displayed in fig 4 as it can be observed in fig 4a the flow velocity in most of the main pipe remained unaffected while the water flow velocity at the crack opening was significantly higher the average velocity at the center of the crack outlet section was 25 63 m s which was very close to the value predicted by the torricelli equation of 27 82 m s the water pressure variations in the pipe and the crack surface due to the velocity changes are displayed in fig 4b the pressure within the pipe was not affected by the leak flow the pressure at the outlet section of the crack was 0 47 mh2o which was very close to the pressure of the surrounding media 0 5 mh2o the flow velocity upstream of the crack was slightly higher than that downstream of the crack the water pressure on the crack surface was very low and even a negative pressure zone was observed different from the estimates reported in previous studies the average pressure on the crack surface was 1 16 lower than the pipe internal pressure this indicates that the crack surface pressure may inhibit the expansion of the crack taking the l 0 case as an example the crack edge displacement vs crack length curves obtained by both the fsi and previous fe simulation methods by cassa et al 2010 at pressures of 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 mh2o are presented in fig 5 it can be observed that the displacement of the middle part of the crack was the largest while that of the two sides was the smallest which was consistent with the prediction by the lefm based models the shape of deformed circumferential cracks is similar to that of longitudinal cracks which is consistent with the findings of previous fe simulation based studies cassa and van zyl 2013 the area obtained by the fsi simulations was averagely 1 2 smaller than that obtained by the fe simulations the leak area variation was calculated by the edge displacement integral the head area slope was obtained by linear regression of the areas calculated under different pressures 3 2 experimental results the data of the leak area and the leakage flow rate under different pressures are summarized in figs 7 and 8 leak exponents were obtained by fitting the leakage flow rate pressure data into eq 2 the geometric parameters of cracks and pipes the measured leak exponents and the head area slopes m of all test sections are summarized in table 2 the leak exponent of most test pipe sections was larger than 0 5 while that of a few circumferential and longitudinal cracks on steel pipe and the 10 3 mm thick ppr pipe was lower than 0 5 under the same conditions the leak exponent of longitudinal cracks was generally larger than that of circumferential cracks which was consistent with the observations of previous studies cassa et al 2010 to illustrate the effect of changing different parameters on the leak area examples of images of the leak areas of different test sections under the pressures of 0 and 40 mh2o are depicted in fig 6 it can be observed that the expansion of cracks at the center was larger than that on both sides which is consistent with the fe simulation results it is worth noting that while their diameter was the same the wall thickness of pipes made of different materials was different consequently it cannot be completely guaranteed that all the other variables are the same when the effect of elastic modulus on leak area is investigated the relationship between the discharge coefficient c d and the reynolds number re of each test section can be calculated as shown in figs 11 in the laminar and traditional flow region of most test pipes c d was positively related to re while in the turbulent region c d decreased with increasing re this means that c d might be negatively correlated with pressure under the actual working conditions of the wdss this is consistent with the models by idelchik 1987 3 3 sensitivity analysis results in the sensitivity analysis study the crack length pipe diameter pipe wall thickness and elastic modulus were changed in turn keeping all the other factors the same as benchmark values the main experimental and fe simulation results as well as the predicted values by the fox klecker tada paris and cassa models are displayed in figs 9 and 10 demonstrating how each single geometric parameter affects the head area slope m the crack length and pipe diameter were found to be positively correlated with m while the wall thickness and young s modulus were negatively correlated with m the crack length appeared to have the greatest effect on m the values of m calculated by the fe simulations were generally higher than the experimental ones for both types of cracks the values of m predicted by the fsi simulations were averagely 1 2 higher than those predicted by the fe simulations in addition the m values predicted by the tada paris tada et al 1985 and klecker models klecker et al 1986 introduced in this study were compared with those predicted by the fox and cassa models introduced by fox et al 2017 and cassa and van zyl 2013 respectively for longitudinal cracks the tada paris l fox and cassa models successfully predicted the general trend of the effect of each parameter on m the m value predicted by the tada paris l model was closer to the experimental and simulation values while the fox model had a relatively high accuracy it overestimated the effect of pipe diameter for circumferential cracks the m values predicted by the klecker and tada paris c models were similar while those predicted by the cassa model had a relatively large deviation from the values of both models the numerical and experimental results of this study revealed that the m of circumferential cracks was much larger than that predicted by the cassa model furthermore no negative m values were observed in this study in general it is difficult to keep the wall thickness constant when the diameter varies or different materials are used in the experiments consequently a few unavoidable deviations can be observed between the experimentally measured and predicted values of m nevertheless this does not affect the evaluation of model accuracy since the predicted values of the model were relatively close to the experimental ones after modifying the pipe wall thickness according to the actual size of the test pipe used in the experiments 4 discussion the numerical simulation of the flow in the pipe fluid domain is helpful to expand the knowledge of the effect of leakage hydraulics on cracks on the one hand the fsi results regarding the computational fluid dynamics revealed that the effect of the leakage flow at the crack on the flow regime and pressure of the main pipe was very small and can be neglected this indicates that the difference between the fsi and fe simulation results can be mainly attributed to the crack face loading nevertheless due to the lack of means to directly measure the crack face loading experimentally under the existing technical conditions the computational fluid dynamics results can provide reliable reference values regarding crack face loading the fsi simulation results demonstrated that the average crack face loading value was negative which means that the leakage discharge could restrain the expansion of the leak area this phenomenon can be explained by analyzing the pressure and velocity fields obtained by simulation of the fluid domain according to fig 4 the pressure of the outlet section of the crack was very close to the pressure of the surrounding media this means that the potential energy of the water pressure is all converted into kinetic energy the streamlines in fig 4a indicate that due to the abrupt change of the flow section a small eddy current appeared near the crack inlet thus the average velocity at the cross section near the entrance was higher than that at the outlet resulting in a negative pressure near the entrance however compared with the internal pressure the overall magnitude of the negative pressure was relatively small since the results of crack face loading by fsi simulation can t be experimentally measured through current technology the effect of crack surface cannot be used to calibrate the coefficient of the lefm based model an important result of this study was that the values predicted by the lefm based model agreed well with the experimental and fe simulation results for both types of cracks in addition the lefm theory helped to understand the relationship between leak area and pressure for fully submerged water pipes according to the lefm theory the stress perpendicular to the crack length has a decisive effect on the leak area that is the circumferential stress σ h determines the area of longitudinal cracks while the longitudinal tensile stress σ t determines the area of circumferential cracks this is also consistent with the phenomenon observed by cassa et al 2010 in their study while the application of additional tensile stress at both ends of the pipe had negligible effect on the leak area of longitudinal crack the effect on the leak area of circumferential crack was significant this explains why the m of longitudinal cracks is larger than that of circumferential cracks first according to eqs 6 and 7 the circumferential stress of pressurized pipes is twice the longitudinal stress therefore as analyzed above the dominating stress of longitudinal cracks is larger than that of circumferential cracks second the stress intensity factor of longitudinal cracks derived by tada et al 1985 is generally larger than that of circumferential cracks the lefm based model emphasized the effects of dominant parameters crack length pipe diameter wall thickness pressure head and elastic modulus and ignored the effect of the initial crack width this is consistent with previous studies fox et al 2017 cassa and van zyl 2013 these dominant parameters were used in dimensionless form in the present model λ θ π r m t g h e the geometric parameters λ θ π r m t reflect the relative size of the crack with respect to the pipe while g h e reflects the relative pressure moreover the sensitivity analysis results highlighted the necessity of introducing the fracture mechanics theory i e without theoretical support the accuracy of the model derived from fe simulations would be extremely dependent on the range of the selected parameters for instance although the fox model is dimensionally consistent an obvious deviation between the predicted and experimental values occurred when l 30 mm t 5 4 and d 150 by contrast the tada paris and kelcker models maintained a relatively high accuracy over a wider range of parameter values in addition although the tada paris model was derived for thin wall pipes r m t 10 the results in this study showed the relative error between fe simulation results experimental results and was acceptable for example the minimum r m t value was 4 85 in test l4 1 and c4 1 the relative errors between the predicted and experimental values were still less than 10 for circumferential cracks the deviation between numerical and experimental results with regard to the values of m in this study and previous studies can be attributed to the effects of the boundary conditions and the discharge coefficients the boundary conditions in the fe simulations in this study were consistent with those in the study by fox et al 2017 thus the difference between the fe simulation results and the fox model was relatively small on the other hand the boundary conditions in cassa and van zyl 2013 assumed that no deformation occurs at the end of the pipe opposite to the crack which may affect the displacement of the crack edges as for the experiments two interesting phenomena about the relationship between c d and re can be observed as shown in fig 11 firstly the measured c d of different test sections showed relatively large difference under the same re ranging from 0 5 to 0 8 this can be explained by the variation of the geometry parameters of the test sections the c d in orifice equation which represents the combined influence of flow contraction and head loss in orifice can be greatly affected by geometry parameters and the roundness of the orifice edge ali and foss 2015 ski and tomasz 1993 lichtarowicz et al 2006 for example research by lichtarowicz et al 2006 showed that changing the ratio between length and diameter of the orifice can led c d to varied from 0 6 to 0 82 under the same re secondly for most of the test sections c d decreased with re in fully turbulence regime this was consistent with the conclusions by idelchik 1987 readerharris et al 1995 furthermore this explains the phenomenon observed in the experiments that the m value of the longitudinal cracks and a few circumferential cracks on steel pipe was larger than 0 but its leak exponent was less than 0 5 according to eq 5 for cracks with small m the effect of the increase of the leak area on the leakage flow is weaker than that of the decrease of the c d thus the leakage exponent was less than 0 5 this also indicates that the leak exponent calculated solely based on q h data cannot effectively represent the leak area variation with pressure it is worth mentioning that although the relative contributions of c d and a on leakage discharge pressure relationship was successfully separated through laboratory experiments in this study the role of the effective area is still irreplaceable in practical applications due to the complexity of field tests the proposed model offers potential benefits for the evaluation and management of leakage in wdss to develop more accurate leakage models further work is needed to explore the interaction between pipe and surrounding medium as well as the effects on the leakage hydraulics 5 conclusions in order to develop analytical models able to describe the leak area pressure relationship for both longitudinal and circumferential cracks the theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics lefm for thin shells was employed and the derived models were validated both numerically and experimentally the results demonstrated that the values predicted by the model were in good agreement with the experimental and fe simulation results for both types of cracks in addition the numerical simulation and experimental results revealed that the pressure of the leakage flow at the crack surface was negative however when compared with the magnitude of the pipe internal pressure its effect can be neglected for most test pipes the discharge coefficient c d decreased with increasing reynolds number in the fully turbulent regime which indicated that c d is negatively correlated with the pressure under the actual working conditions of the wdss the pressure head area slopes of all circumferential cracks investigated in this study were positive the fact that the leak exponent was less than 0 5 was attributed to that the effect of the decrease of c d on the leak flow rate was stronger than that of the area expansion the linear elastic model derived in this study can be used as a reference to evaluate the leakage flow pressure relationship of pipe network systems thus contributing to the development of pressure

accurate identification of radicals in advanced oxidation processes aops is important to study the mechanisms on radical production and subsequent oxidation reduction reaction the commonly applied

inactivation miklos et al 2018 sun et al 2016 generally aops involve production of radicals with high oxidization ability for degradation transformation of pollutants ike et al 2019 ma et al 2021 particularly ultraviolet uv based aops such as uv h2o2 uv peroxodisulfate pds s2o8 2 uv peroxomonosulfate pms hso5 uv peracetic acid paa ch3c o ooh uv io4 uv hclo uv nh2cl etc are most widely applied technologies due to efficient and rapid production of radicals ao et al 2021 lee et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the energy input of uv can directly break the specific bonds such as peroxy bond in h2o2

undergo single molecule decay to form nucleophilic ch3 ao et al 2021 kim et al 2020 in uv io4 system iodine related radicals including iodate radical io3 and periodate radical io4 can be produced accompanied by oh zhang et al 2021 io3 and io4 are also active oxygen center radicals containing halogen which are electrophilic and can selectively react with organic substrates tian et al 2017 in aops systems clarification of the production evolution mechanism reaction activity and selectivity of radicals are important to clearly understand the subsequent reactions with target pollutants yang et al 2020 therefore identification of radicals is a prerequisite procedure electron paramagnetic resonance epr is a cutting edge technology to directly determine radicals by means of spectrum characteristics recognition gerson and huber 2003 trapping agent such as 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo is used to convert short lived radical into stable metastable radical addition product and then the radical adduct is identified based on the hyperfine splitting from n and h nuclei on characteristic spectrum due to the difference of polarity and electronegativity of radical groups brustolon and giamello 2009 davies 2016 however there are still inconsistency in the recognition of epr spectrum in previous studies which causes a misleading to accurately identify the signals of radicals 1 incorrect information recognizing on basic parameters of epr spectrum such as unit and plotting 2 incorrect applied determination conditions such as selected solvent solution ph and trapping agent 3 incorrect identification of radicals spectra due to interference by impurities signals 4 insufficient description of radicals spectra with only peak shape number or intensity ratio therefore establishment of accurate measurement and identification method for radicals by using epr is very important the objective of this work was to provide a comprehensive study to identify radicals in typical uv based aops through in situ epr method and meanwhile clearly illustrate the possible erroneous zone in epr test for specific aop system dmpo was used as a trapping agent to capture radicals in conventional and emerging uv based aops including uv h2o2 uv pds and pms uv paa and uv io4 epr experiments and easyspin simulation in matlab software were used to describe the characteristics of radicals spectra moreover the mechanisms of radicals formation and evolution in the uv aops were also proposed this study can provide an overall

specific time 0 15 min was recorded epr signals in organic solvents including methanol ethanol dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and tert butanol tba were also obtained besides di water 2 2 in situ epr tests the epr spectra were recorded at 20 c equipped with circulating water system to maintain the temperature and the epr spectrometer was operated at an x band frequency of 9 84 ghz spectrometer parameters were as follows sweep width of 100 g center field of 3505 g sweep time of 30 or 60 s modulation amplitude of 1 g modulation frequency of 100 khz receiver gain of 30 db microwave attention of 25 db convention time of 12 64 ms and time constant of 5 12 ms matlab software version r2021a and the easyspin package version 5 2 33 were used to analyze and simulate the obtained epr data specifically the original data were imported by the easyspin program in the matlab and then the simulation parameters were set the g value of radical was set as 2 0055 2 0065 the magnetic core of radical was set as 1 h and 14 n according to dmpo capture agent ooh and hso4 need to be increased by 1h the hyperfine coupling constant an and ah were obtained directly from the test spectrum 3 results and discussion 3 1 radical signals recognition in epr spectrum as a radical trapping agent dmpo can capture short lived radicals and convert them to stable dmpo radical addition products spulber and schlick 2010 the radical labeled as r prefers to attack the c n bond of dmpo molecule structure shown in fig s3 and add on α c and then the free electron will transfer to n o group to form dmpo adduct radical dmpo r villamena et al 2005 the spectral signal of dmpo r detected by epr is isotropic and has an average g factor around 2 0055 2 0065 where g is the spectroscopic splitting factor and can be used to determine the central magnetic field in combination with microwave frequency makino et al 1991 quintanilha 1985 the free electron of dmpo adduct is affected by the magnetic interaction of the surrounding magnetic nuclei nβ and hβ atoms in dmpo mainly the fermi contact interaction contributed by the s orbital electrons nβ and hβ of dmpo adduct can split into 3 and 2 spectral lines based on hyperfine splitting law respectively fig s4 the differences in electronegativity and structure of radical group r are finally exhibited as parameters of hyperfine coupling constant anβ and ahβ spectral width sw and line width lw 3 2 hydroxyl radical and hydroperoxyl radical in uv h2o2 system uv h2o2 is a classic aop system for water treatment in which oh and ooh are primary radicals after activation yuan et al 2009 the quantum yield of h2o2 decomposition at 254 nm is 1 0 table s1 zhang et al 2019a in uv aops the quantum yield φ is an important parameter to evaluate the photos unitization efficiency text s2 oh is mainly generated from the homolytic cleavage of the peroxy bond eq 1 with a bond dissociation energy of 213 kj mol in addition ooh would also be generated along with side reaction k 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 eq 2 mierzwa et al 2018 wang et al 2022 1 h 2 o 2 uv 2 oh 2 h 2 o 2 oh ooh h 2 o 3 ooh o 2 h 4 c h 3 oh oh uv c h 2 oh h 2 o epr tests indicated that dmpo didn t react with h2o2 in dark fig 2 a while under uv light irradiation a quartet signal with the intensity of 1 2 2 1 was clearly observed and the signal intensity increased with time the generated signal was assigned to oh with an ah 14 9 gauss g and the total spectral width of 45 g 0 2 g fig 2b liu et al 2016 the signal of dmpo oh can be preserved for another 5 min after the lamp was turned off fig 2a however ooh cannot be detected for this system in water matrix because the reaction rate constant between dmpo and oh k 3 4 109 m 1 s 1 was much higher than ooh k 30 m 1 s 1 in water buettner 1990 fontmorin et al 2016 besides the dmpo adduct dmpo ooh can easily decompose into dmpo oh k 4 9 106 m 1 s 1 buettner 1990 however the dmpo ooh spectrum cannot be masked by that of dmpo oh as the total spectral width of dmpo ooh spectrum was narrower 40 g presenting as a twelve fold peak after simulation in fig 2b an 14 g ah 11 g and ahγ 1 5 g in addition the experimental dmpo ooh spectrum showed different spectral signals fig s5 due to the different test conditions solvents and parameters ah and ahγ the total spectral width of 40 g and ahγ 1 5 g are the characteristic signals for ooh therefore it cannot accurately estimate if ooh produced in water solution due to detection limit and organic solvents like methanol and dmso was further applied to identify ooh typically the spectrum of ooh was detected in methanol solution an 14 g ah 10 g ahγ 1 5 g in the simulation and lw 0 3 fig 2c however ooh pka 4 8 ooh o2 h could transform into o2 by deprotonation eq 3 he et al 2020 the different from dmpo ooh and dmpo o2 are discussed in text s3 the most prominent characteristic of dmpo ooh is the existence of a third magnetic nucleus hγ which is different from dmpo o2 fig s6 according to the hyperfine splitting law the magnetic effect of hγ will be further superimposed on the original spectrum which is characterized by small peaks near each peak fig s7 in methanol solvent matrix for ooh detection another important challenge is how to distinguish the different signals of ooh and hydroxylated methyl radical ch2oh under uv light irradiation the α h of methanol can be abstracted by oh to form ch2oh eq 4 levy et al 2012 the total spectral width of dmpo ch2oh was simulated as 52 g an 15 6 g and ah 20 8 g fig 2d larger than that of dmpo ooh 40 g characteristic of dmpo ch2oh spectrum is also discussed in detail in text s3 and figs s8 and s9 therefore to prevent the interference of ch2oh excessive water in methanol solution needs to be avoided another interfering radical is ch3 when dmso was applied as solvent as oh would attack the methyl group of dmso for ch3 formation fig s10 only ch3 was detected but no signal of ooh at 1 min further confirmed that ooh came from the secondary reaction eq 2 in uv h2o2 system fig s11 the characteristic parameters of ch3 and ooh in dmso were obtained by simulation analysis fig s12 dmpo ooh an 13 g ah 9 g ahγ 1 7 g and dmpo ch3 an 15 g ah 21 g in conclusion for uv h2o2 system oh can be directly captured and well identified in water but detection of ooh should be conducted in organic solvents such as methanol and dmso in methanol solution ooh can be detected directly but it is easy to be incorrectly identified as deprotonated o2 the most important feature of ooh is the small peak assigned to hγ oh will be totally quenched in pure methanol solvent while it will transform into ch2oh with a spectral width 50 g in mixed water methanol matrix oh in dmso solution will directly transform into ch3 which has a similar signal characteristic parameters to ch2oh 3 3 sulfate radical in uv pds and uv pms systems sodium pds na2s2o8 and potassium pds k2s2o8 have the similar symmetrical structure as h2o2 with bond o o dissociation energy of 92 kj mol so4 is the primary radical after uv activation of pds eq 5 wang and wang 2018 in addition so4 can further react with oh k 7 107 m 1 s 1 to generate oh eqs 6 and 7 yang et al 2014 while reaction with h2o is negligible due to much low rate constant k 2 103 s 1 gao et al 2020 therefore ph has a great effect on the radical transformation and so4 is more likely to exist under acidic condition 5 s 2 o 8 2 uv 2 s o 4 6 s o 4 o h so 4 2 oh 7 s o 4 h 2 o so 4 2 oh h 8 dmpo s o 4 o h so 4 2 dmpo oh 9 s o 4 h hs o 4 10 dmpo s o 4 h dmpo hs o 4 11 hso 5 uv s o 4 oh epr test clearly indicated the generation of so4 in uv pds system first while the signal of so4 then gradually converted to oh signal along time fig 3 a after light turn off for 5 min almost all so4 signal converted to dmpo oh indicating dmpo oh had higher stability than dmpo so4 fagan et al 2022 therefore in the uv pms or uv pds system incorrect conclusion on production of oh may be drawn because i the dmpo oh signal may attribute to conversion from so4 to oh eqs 6 and 7 ii dmpo so4 can also transform into dmpo oh through hydrolysis nucleophilic substitution and intramolecular cleavage reaction eq 8 and fig s13 gao et al 2020 zamora and villamena 2012 however these two transformations form so4 to ho or from dmpo so4 to dmpo ho is hard to distinguish in the reaction both for uv pms and uv pds systems after the light was turned off the increase of dmpo ho signal can only be attributed to the conversion of dmpo so4 due to the much longer half lifetime of dmpo so4 1 min than so4 30 40 μs through simulation the combined spectrum of oh an ah 14 9 g and so4 an 13 8 g ah 10 1 g ahγ 1 4 g ahγ 0 8 g was also obtained fig 3b so4 is the key radical to be identified in uv pds or uv pms system for epr analysis but its existing form has not well illustrated previously as the protonated species hso4 may play a more important role similar to ooh strictly speaking the spectrum of captured signal fig 3b should be attributed to dmpo hso4 due to the evident spectral signal of hγ fig s14 however it is not represented the existence of hso4 in aqueous solution owing to its relatively low pka value of 2 0 hso4 so4 h wang et al 2016 hγ has been widely reported in the analysis of so4 gao et al 2020 wei et al 2017 the dmpo hso4 signal can come from 1 protonation of so4 eq 9 and then captured by dmpo or 2 protonation of dmpo adduct dmpo so4 eq 10 the protonation process is more likely to occur in dmpo adduct eq 10 because spectral signals of dmpo hso4 with two hγ were still detected in strong alkaline condition of ph 10 fig s15 due to the reaction between dmpo so4 and h the split signal of hγ in the dmpo hso4 spectrum was the most obvious distinguishing feature fig s16 actually the protonation of dmpo so4 to form dmpo hso4 eq 10 can easily occur so the captured so4 generally appears in the form of dmpo hso4 in epr spectrum figs s15 s17 the dmpo hso4 adduct is more stable due to intramolecular hydrogen bond compared with dmpo so4 zamora and villamena 2012 although only one hγ atom existed in the molecular structure of dmpo hso4 fig s18 signals assigned to two hγ appeared in epr spectrum fig s17 which was caused by the angle between dmpo and hso4 as discussed in text s4 moreover in water solution although so4 can be identified it is difficult to accurately analyze the signal characteristics of so4 due to the overlapped signal of dmpo oh fig 3a and b therefore another solvent is needed for further analysis to avoid the interference of oh previous study reported that addition of 5 v v dmso in water could convert oh into ch3 thus realizing simultaneous identification of so4 and oh gao et al 2020 in addition dmso can block the conversion of so4 to oh due to the absence of oh eq 6 zhou et al 2020 so dmso can be used as an inhibitor in uv pms or uv pds system walger et al 2021 therefore accurate detection of so4 without the interference of oh can be achieved in dmso matrix although dmso may also react with so4 resulting in quench effect the higher reaction rate of so4 addition on dmpo and remarkable dmpo so4 signal lead to accurate identification of this radical gao et al 2020 westwood et al 2019 yuan et al 2015 fig 3c displays the spectrum of radicals produced in uv pds system using dmso solvent and only so4 was identified an 13 g ah 9 1 g ahγ 1 4 g and ahγ 0 8 g while no oh and ch3 signals were observed therefore the results directly prove only so4 can be produced after radical homolytic cleavage from pds as shown in eq 6 in addition the key parameters of dmpo so4 in epr spectrum are the values of ah and hγ where ah of so4 is up to 9 g fig 3c unlike uv pds radical homolytic cleavage of peroxy bond in pms can directly generate so4 and oh simultaneously eq 11 pms molecule has an asymmetric structure with a higher peroxy bond dissociation energy of 377 kj mol lee et al 2020 resulting in a quantum yield of 0 52 at light wavelength of 254 nm for pms compared with 1 4 for pds table s1 wang and wang 2018 lower quantum yield for uv pms system suggested relatively weaker signals of so4 and oh compared that in uv pds spectrum under same experimental analytical conditions fig 3d for the uv pms system in water solution the formation of so4 cannot be identified directly and clearly so pms with high concentration and organic solvent dmso are then introduced results are discussed in text s5 and figs s19 s21 in uv pds or uv pms systems strictly speaking the captured spectral signal of so4 should be assigned to dmpo hso4 moreover the signal of dmpo so4 will be transform into that of dmpo oh in water matrix so accurate identification of so4 can be achieved in organic solvent e g dmso matrix to inhibit the reaction of so4 with oh h2o in dmso solvent complete dmpo so4 signal can be clearly observed especially for the most prominent two hγ furthermore in this system with the coexistence of so4 and oh one common misunderstanding also needs be clarified is that the ratio of the signal intensities cannot be applied to represent the concentration ratio of the two radicals resulting from the transformation of oh from so4 and convention of dmpo so4 to dmpo oh signal 3 4 acetyloxyl and acetylperoxyl radicals in uv paa system the peroxy bond dissociation energy of paa 159 kj mol is weaker than that of h2o2 213 kj mol and the quantum yield of uv activation at wavelength of 254 nm is 0 88 table s1 wu et al 2020 various radicals mainly oh ch3c o o ch3c o oo and ch3 can be produced in paa based aop systems but there are few direct evidences on generation of alkoxy radicals in uv paa system until now generally a typical uv paa system includes several radical chain reactions eqs 12 14 ao et al 2021 cai et al 2017 wu et al 2020 and therefore ch3c o o ch3c o oo ch3 and oh are the key radicals to be accurately identified in this system similar to other peroxides the homolytic reaction of paa under uv irradiation can also produce ch3c o o and oh first cai et al 2017 eq 12 however previous studies widely claimed that ch3c o oo could be the dominant radical in this system for example huang s group elucidated radicals production mechanism in uv paa system through experimental data and reaction kinetics modeling and they claimed ch3c o oo was the most abundant radical and played the most important role in organic compounds degradation wu et al 2020 the reasons why ch3c o oo is the dominant radical are 1 both produced ch3c o o and oh will undergo a further reaction with paa to generate ch3c o oo eqs 13 and 14 wu et al 2020 2 ch3c o o will rapidly decompose to ch3 with a high reaction rate constant of 2 3 105 s 1 eq 15 ao et al 2021 du et al 2022 therefore to deeply understanding the mechanisms on radicals production and reaction with organic pollutants in the uv paa aop system identification of ch3c o o and ch3c o oo is the most important proposition 12 c h 3 c o ooh uv c h 3 c o o oh 13 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o ooh c h 3 c o oo c h 3 c o oh 14 oh c h 3 c o ooh c h 3 c o oo h 2 o 15 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o 2 16 c h 3 o 2 ooc h 3 for epr analysis in water matrix fig 4 a paa did not react with dmpo and no relevant spectrum was detected in dark after uv irradiation several peaks indexed to oh and ch3 an 15 9 g ah 22 8 g in the simulation appeared fig 4b ch3 came from the self decomposition of ch3c o o as shown in eq 15 and identification of ch3 indicated the generation of ch3c o o the signals of oh and ch3 gradually increased as irradiation time prolonged which still could be detected after uv light was turned off for 5 min fig 4a suggesting the stability of dmpo oh and dmpo ch3 unfortunately in uv paa system we did not directly detect the signal of ch3c o oo in water solution it is different from the results obtained in homogenous co ii paa system in which we successfully identify ch3c o oo through epr fig s22 du et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to establish radicals analytical method in other organic solvents to further identify ch3c o oo in methanol solution fig s23 although the signal of dmpo ch3c o oo was observed it was not obvious due to the interference of strong dmpo ch3 signal in dmso solution fig s24 only ch3 but no ch3c o oo was detected previous studies have reported high viscosity of solvent can lead to more obvious spectrum of macromolecular radical akdogan et al 2010 thus ethanol and tba with higher viscosity were selected as solvents to further detect ch3c o oo and the results exactly indicated the formation of ch3c o oo fig 4c different from dmpo oh and dmpo ch3 in water the spectrum of ch3c o oo belongs to dmpo ooch3 model fig s25 presenting a total spectral width of 37 g and hyperfine splitting constant of anβ 13 5 g ahβ 8 5 g and ahγ 1 5 g buettner 1987 therefore another possible radical produced in this system was methylperoxyl radical ooch3 converted from the rapid reaction between generated ch3 and dissolved oxygen o2 k 4 7 109 m 1 s 1 eq 16 as reported before zhang and huang 2020 ooch3 also has a high steady state concentration 2 7 10 2 10 9 m in the uv paa process according to the kinetics modeling zhang and huang 2020 in terms of epr spectrum for dmpo adducts the difference between dmpo ch3c o oo and dmpo ooch3 is not obvious because they both belong to dmpo oor model and dmpo capture cannot distinguish the r group in the dmpo oor model in epr spectra we further demonstrate the production of ch3c o oo without the interference of ooch3 as the ooch3 is formed in the presence of oxygen eq 16 an oxygen free condition was constructed by introducing nitrogen into the ethanol test system to block the generation of ooch3 the result indicates that the intensity of dmpo adduct signal didn t significantly change after introducing nitrogen fig s26 which determined the negligible contribution of ooch3 to the signal although ethanol and tba were used as solvents for radical detection ethanol radical and tba radical almost could not be detected in uv paa system both of them are typical carbon center radicals which have specific signals with spectral width 45 g simulated in fig s27 therefore application of ethanol and tba as solvents are available for ch3c o oo identification ahβ 8g and the existence of hγ are the most typical characteristics of ch3c o oo compared with ch3c o o further analysis confirmed that the spectrum parameters of ch3c o oo captured in ethanol and tert butanol were consistent besides self decomposition ch3c o o can also eliminate through a self dimerization to form peroxide product fig s28 thus also leading to hard determination of ch3c o o due to extremely low concentration therefore the current method is still unable to directly detect ch3c o o the simulated spectrum of ch3c o o belongs to dmpo och3 model fig 4d which has a total spectral width 34 5 g ah 7 5 g and an 13 5 g for the identification of unstable radicals such as ch3c o o through epr the capture process of epr signal needs to fully consider the applicability of capturing agent radical concentration and solvent condition 5 tert butoxycarbonyl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide bmpo could be applied as a possible capturing agent for the future analysis as a more stable bmpo ch3c o o adduct with longer half lifetime is formed keszler et al 2003 in the future we will further explore the detection methods for these unstable radicals including application of characteristic capturing agents or operation under specific test conditions e g low temperature and inert gas atmosphere in total for uv paa system abundant radicals can be captured using different solvents where oh and ch3 can be directly detected in water however ch3c o oo cannot be clearly identified in water methanol and dmso due to the interference of ch3 and consumption by self dimerization ethanol and tert butyl alcohol of higher viscosity can be used as solvents to accurately detect ch3c o oo in addition for the epr signals of primary radicals in paa system fig 4d the total spectral width of oxygen centered radicals e g ch3c o oo and ch3c o o is 45 g while that of carbon centered radical ch3 is 45 g in addition atom with higher electronegativity has stronger ability to attract electron li and xue 2006 the electronegativity carbon 2 55 is lower than that of oxygen 3 44 resulting in the weaker electron attraction and greater ah of dmpo adduct the in situ epr method established in this work provides direct evidence on formation of acetylperoxyl radicals in paa aop system which can be applied as a method guidance for the identification of alkoxy and alkylperoxyl radicals in other aop systems 3 5 periodate radical and hydrated electron in uv io4 system generally the primary radicals in uv io4 system are reported as io3 and io4 which play key roles in degradation of organic pollutants djaballah et al 2021 however until now there has been no direct evidence on formation of these two radicals in this system so method on epr analysis is eagerly needed in water solution fig 5 a io4 oxidation potential of 1 6 v could directly oxidize dmpo to form dmpox fig s29 choi et al 2018 in addition fig 5b shows the simulation results and the obvious triplet peak was attributed to dmpoo an 15 5 g after photo induced oxidation of dmpo under strong oxidation condition e g in the presence of io4 li et al 2015 the formation of dmpoo and dmpox is a characteristic for the presence of strong oxidative agent in the system discussed in text s6 but it cannot be applied as a criterion for evaluation of io3 and io4 interestingly a carbon centric radical was also formed in uv io4 system according to an 16 2 g and ah 23 6 g 2 min in fig 5a zeng et al 2020 it is clear that no other carbon source was introduced in this system except for dmpo implying dmpo was oxidized to a carbon centric radical i e dmpo degradation radical dmpod due to the existence of hβ in dmpod fig s30 the c n bond in dmpo molecule was most likely to cleavage based on the total spectral width of 56 g dmpod belonged to a saturated alkane radical fig s31 which may be attributed to the strong oxidation ability of io3 and io4 further analysis of the 2 min s spectrum revealed that oh was also identified fig s31 converted from the protonation of o oh o h pka 11 9 zhang et al 2021 o will quickly convert to its protonated form oh under acidic neutral and weakly alkaline conditions eq 19 the epr signal spectrum of dmpo o is same as that of dmpo oh where the effect of hγ on hyperfine splitting of an and ah is negligible in the dmpo ohγ to the best of our knowledge no previous studies have clearly illustrated the existence of radicals especially io3 and io4 in uv io4 system after 5 min s irradiation the signal of dmpoo continued to increase while the signal of dmpo oh and dmpod became relatively weak io3 io4 oh and hydrated electron e aq are detected in uv io4 system where io3 and io4 are inferred as the main active species for the transformation from dmpo to dmpoo to further investigate the roles of io3 and io4 in formation of dmpoo signal in uv io3 system was detected as in this system only io3 oh and hydrated electron e aq can be produced but no io4 boukhedoua et al 2021 as shown in fig s32 dmpo io3 signal was detected in dmso solution in the uv io3 system however no signal assigned to dmpoo was obtained in water fig s33 therefore io3 cannot induce oxidation of dmpo to dmpoo which directly confirmed the contribution of io4 to dmpo oxidation in the uv io4 system moreover previous researches also reported that io3 mainly exhibited reduction ability haddad et al 2019 sun et al 2017 while its contribution to oxidation of target substances was limited liu et al 2022 the continuous increase of dmpoo signal was attributed to the activation of dmpo io4 adduct under uv light showing a strong oxygenation ability fig s34 after light off only extremely weak signal of dmpox was observed in water matrix no signals assigned to primary reactive species like io3 and io4 were detected so organic solvent of methanol was further introduced interestingly a weak signal attributed to io4 was captured in dark fig s35 as the hyperfine splitting constants were anβ 14 0 g and ahβ 8 0 g formation of io4 further confirmed the strong oxidation ability and electron transfer of io4 however the signal disappeared after uv light irradiation attributed to quenching by other generated radical or further transformation dmso solvent was further applied to evaluate if another i related radical such as io3 was produced fig 5c indicates that io4 did not react with dmso as no signal was observed in dark a totally different spectrum was obtained with light on besides weak signal of dmpo io4 strong signal assigned to io3 was obtained with a total spectral width of 41 g ah of 12 9 g and an of 14 2 g to our knowledge it is the first time to detect the iodate related radicals in uv io4 system by epr hydrated electron is another important reactive species that widely reported liu et al 2021 yu et al 2018 which can be captured by tempo which is a stable radical showing a triple peak with intensity of 1 1 1 in water an 17 3 g fig s36 after capturing hydrated electron tempo will transform into a singlet organic matter without paramagnetism fig 5d presents that the signal of tempo did not decrease with addition of io4 in dark suggesting io4 did not react with tempo in addition uv irradiation alone also had no effect on the tempo signal and the intensity did not change within 10 mins irradiation fig s37 however after the light was turned on the signal decreased rapidly and tempo 100 μμ was completely transformed after 5 min fig 5d which directly confirmed the existence of hydrated electron in the reaction system the capture of hydrated electron by tempo in this system was further verified by an ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography mass mass system uplc ms ms for product detection methods shown in text s7 results presented in fig s38 and table s2 tempo was detected m z 157 14607 rt 9 04 min esi and its concentration decreased along reaction time figs s38a c and s39 the reduction product temp m z 142 15891 rt 5 68 min esi after hydrated electron attack was successfully detected figs s38d e and s39 which was formed via a deoxygenation and subsequent hydrogenation at the n site fig 5d in addition the conversion rate from tempo to temp obtained by uplc ms ms was consistent with the elimination rate of tempo signal got by through epr method table s3 confirming that the disappearance of tempo signal in epr spectrum was attributed to addition of hydrated electron rather than iodine related radicals attack actually all the reactive species io3 io4 oh and hydrated electron were generated in the uv io4 system meanwhile however different detection conditions e g solvents and capturing agents should be applied to identify specific species the selective production of reactive species also can be realized through the control of water chemistry factors such as ph which is the key parameter affecting the formation of species particularly the identification of activation pathway for generation of io4 and hydrated electron is of great significance in this aop process for pollutants degradation based on the aforementioned results the radical formation and evolution in uv io4 system can be inferred to procced through two pathways fig s40 the first pathway has been reported by previous studies merouani and hamdaoui 2021 zhang et al 2021 cleavage of i o bond for the production of io3 and o eq 17 and then o can be easily protonated to generate oh gao et al 2020 eq 19 moreover radicals transformation to generate io4 from io3 and oh may also occur eqs 20 and 21 the second pathway is confirmed based on epr analysis of this study uv light can directly activate io4 to form io4 and hydrated electron e aq eq 18 this work for first time provided the direct evidences on formation of io3 io4 and hydrated electron in uv io4 system by epr analysis in addition a new io4 activation pathway under uv irradiation was confirmed based on successful detection of io4 and hydrated electron for the first time 17 io 4 uv io 3 o 18 io 4 uv i o 4 e aq 19 o h oh 20 oh io 4 i o 4 o h 21 i o 3 io 4 i o 4 io 3 3 6 summary of radical signals in epr spectrum as described above dmpo can effectively identify the typical radicals in uv based aops system and further capture unconventional radicals by application of organic solvents e g methanol dmso and ethanol according to the hyperfine coupling constant of an and ah the types of radicals can be clearly differentiated fig 6 a in the aops for water treatment the generated radicals generally possess a structure of o or c centered ao et al 2021 deng and zhao 2015 to determine the speciation of dmpo capture radicals in epr spectrum dmpo oh can be selected as a criterion due to its specificity as a quartet peak caused by the overlapping of an ah and a total spectral width of 45 g is the typical characteristic fig 6c e lauricella and tuccio 2020 thus radicals with the total spectral width 45 g are classified as c centered radicals while that 45 g are classified as o centered radicals in addition radical with weaker electronegativity has higher ah value table 1 summarizes the key physicochemical properties of radicals and parameters of dmpo captured radicals in the four uv based aops systems the total spectral width is two time of the sum value of an and ah and the total spectral width and ah of typical radicals are ranked as ch3 23 g oh 15 g io3 12 9 g o2 11 g ooh 9 11 g io4 9 10 g so4 9 10 g ch3c o oo 8 5 g ch3c o o 7 5 g fig 6d for ooh and hso4 hγ is the characteristic parameter to describe them compared with o2 and so4 respectively however for identification of dmpo captured oxygen center radical through epr only the first element boned to oxygen in radicals such as hydroxyl oh alkoxy oc alkyl peroxide oo etc can be distinguished fig 6b for accurate identification of all kinds of radicals a comprehensive strategy is needed with consideration of trapping agent epr instrument operation condition solvent condition and even radicals formation mechanism 4 conclusion this study presented an overall summary on identification of radicals by epr in typical uv based homogenous aop systems and carefully discussed the challenges in this area the obtained findings can provide a reference for identification of radicals in such uv aops and even in other aops with similar radicals production the primary and important findings are 1 in uv h2o2 system ooh and o2 are also produced and the roles cannot be ignored accurate identification of these two radicals can be achieved in alcohol solvents while the interference of alcohol radicals e g ch2oh and ch3 needs to be avoided 2 in uv pms and uv pds systems so4 can be accurately identified in specific organic solvent dmso without the interference of oh and transformation of so4 to oh is a big challenge for radical identification in this system 3 in uv paa system ch3c o oo can be effectively detected in alcohol solvents ethanol or tba while the signal of ch3 detected in water can be applied as an alternative characteristic signal of ch3c o o due to its self decomposition 4 in uv io4 system two activation pathways were proposed based on radical indemnification i e formation of 1 io3 and oh and 2 io4 and hydrated electron the iodine related radicals can be efficiently identified in dmso while the hydrated electron can be accurately and quantitively detected using tempo as trapping agent in the future for accurate identification of radicals by epr specific analytical conditions should be considered according to the characteristics of the aop system including type of radical trapping agent solvent matrix reaction time analytical operation temperature in

accurate identification of radicals in advanced oxidation processes aops is important to study the mechanisms on radical production and subsequent oxidation reduction reaction the commonly applied radical quenching experiments cannot provide direct evidences on generation and evolution of radicals in aops while electron paramagnetic resonance epr is a cutting edge technology to identify radicals based on spectral characteristics however the complexity of epr spectrum brings uncertainty and inconsistency to radical identification and mechanism clarification this work presented a comprehensive study on identification of radicals by in situ epr analysis in four typical uv based homogenous aops including uv h2o2 uv peroxodisulfate and peroxymonosulfate uv peracetic acid and uv io4 systems radical formation mechanism was also clarified based on epr results a reliable epr method using organic solvents was proposed to identify alkoxy and alkyl radicals ch3c o oo ch3c o o and ch3 in uv paa system two activation pathways for radical production were proposed in uv io4 system in which the produced io3 io4 oh and hydrated electron were precisely detected it is interesting that addition of specific organic solvents can effectively identify oxygen center and carbon center radicals a key parameter in epr spectrum for 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo spin adduct ah is ranked as ch3 23 g oh 15 g io3 12 9 g o2 11 g ooh 9 11 g io4 9 10 g so4 9 10 g ch3c o oo 8 5 g ch3c o o 7 5 g this study will give a systematic method on identification of radicals in aops and shed light on the insightful understanding of radical production mechanism graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords radical advanced oxidation processes ultraviolet homogeneous electron paramagnetic resonance 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aops have drawn intensive attention in water treatment area for organic pollutants degradation and pathogenic microorganisms inactivation miklos et al 2018 sun et al 2016 generally aops involve production of radicals with high oxidization ability for degradation transformation of pollutants ike et al 2019 ma et al 2021 particularly ultraviolet uv based aops such as uv h2o2 uv peroxodisulfate pds s2o8 2 uv peroxomonosulfate pms hso5 uv peracetic acid paa ch3c o ooh uv io4 uv hclo uv nh2cl etc are most widely applied technologies due to efficient and rapid production of radicals ao et al 2021 lee et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the energy input of uv can directly break the specific bonds such as peroxy bond in h2o2 paa pds and pms and the reaction rate constant between radicals and pollutants is extremely high 109 m 1 s 1 which is almost controlled by diffusion zhang et al 2019b uv h2o2 system is a classical uv based aop in which hydroxyl radical oh superoxide radical o2 and hydroperoxyl radical ooh with strong oxidation capacity are produced sobańska et al 2017 oh e 0 1 9 2 7 v vs nhe the most common reactive oxidation species ros is a strong electrophilic radical and can attack organics through radical addition elimination electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction xu et al 2017 o2 e 0 0 94 v vs she has less reactivity due to its anionic form which tends to attack organics through single electron transfer krumova and cosa 2016 however the protonation radical hoo e 0 1 06 v vs she has higher reaction activity and can undergo hydrogen abstraction and radical addition reactions iuga et al 2012 marino et al 2014 uv pds and uv pms systems are typical sulfate radical so4 based aops and so4 e 0 2 6 3 1 v vs nhe has become a popular alternative of oh in recent years due to its stronger oxidation ability and higher selectivity in broad ph ranges chen et al 2021 uv paa system has drawn increasing interests in water treatment area because of the high efficiency various radicals production and low toxic by products production da silva et al 2020 shah et al 2015 besides oh electrophilic radicals including acetoxy radical ch3c o o and acetylperoxyl radical ch3c o oo also can be generated in this system ao et al 2021 ch3c o oo is considered to be the most concentrated active species in paa system 10 10 m wu et al 2020 which has a longer life and tends to attack aromatic rings with high electron density wu et al 2020 ch3c o o is relatively unstable and would further undergo single molecule decay to form nucleophilic ch3 ao et al 2021 kim et al 2020 in uv io4 system iodine related radicals including iodate radical io3 and periodate radical io4 can be produced accompanied by oh zhang et al 2021 io3 and io4 are also active oxygen center radicals containing halogen which are electrophilic and can selectively react with organic substrates tian et al 2017 in aops systems clarification of the production evolution mechanism reaction activity and selectivity of radicals are important to clearly understand the subsequent reactions with target pollutants yang et al 2020 therefore identification of radicals is a prerequisite procedure electron paramagnetic resonance epr is a cutting edge technology to directly determine radicals by means of spectrum characteristics recognition gerson and huber 2003 trapping agent such as 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo is used to convert short lived radical into stable metastable radical addition product and then the radical adduct is identified based on the hyperfine splitting from n and h nuclei on characteristic spectrum due to the difference of polarity and electronegativity of radical groups brustolon and giamello 2009 davies 2016 however there are still inconsistency in the recognition of epr spectrum in previous studies which causes a misleading to accurately identify the signals of radicals 1 incorrect information recognizing on basic parameters of epr spectrum such as unit and plotting 2 incorrect applied determination conditions such as selected solvent solution ph and trapping agent 3 incorrect identification of radicals spectra due to interference by impurities signals 4 insufficient description of radicals spectra with only peak shape number or intensity ratio therefore establishment of accurate measurement and identification method for radicals by using epr is very important the objective of this work was to provide a comprehensive study to identify radicals in typical uv based aops through in situ epr method and meanwhile clearly illustrate the possible erroneous zone in epr test for specific aop system dmpo was used as a trapping agent to capture radicals in conventional and emerging uv based aops including uv h2o2 uv pds and pms uv paa and uv io4 epr experiments and easyspin simulation in matlab software were used to describe the characteristics of radicals spectra moreover the mechanisms of radicals formation and evolution in the uv aops were also proposed this study can provide an overall and deep insights into identification of radicals in uv based and even universal aop systems through epr 2 materials and methods 2 1 radicals production in various uv based aops chemicals used in this study are presented in text s1 of supplementary data sd in this study an in situ and integrated reaction and detection instrument was established on an emxplus 6 1 epr spectrometer bruker germany fig 1 and the schematic diagram of this in situ epr experimental set up was also presented in fig s1 the radicals were generated in a quartz standard sampling tube under uv light irradiation a 254 nm low pressure mercury lamp cel lph120 254 beijing zhongjiao jinyuan technology co ltd china was applied as the uv source and parallelly placed 8 cm away on the side of sampling tube reaction center fig 1a c and light intensity was 5 mw cm2 in the reaction center all the oxidants h2o2 pds pms paa and io4 can be effectively activated under uv 254 light obtained by the uv vis absorption spectra fig s2 four uv based aops are investigated including uv h2o2 uv pds and uv pms uv paa and uv io4 systems in a typical uv aop reaction 50 μl of 100 mm oxidant solution h2o2 pds pms paa or io4 was mixed with 445 μl solvent deionized water or organic solvent then 5 μl of dmpo as capturing agent was added into the solution reach a final concentration of 97 mm after shaking for 60 s 30 μl of solution was sampled into the quartz standard sampling tube ringcaps hirschmann germany and the bottom of sampling tube was sealed with wax sealing plate sealing hirschmann germany the quartz standard sampling tube was then placed in epr specific sample tube fig 1f for further in situ radical production and detection after scanning background signal the uv light was turned on the signal of dmpo radical at specific time 0 15 min was recorded epr signals in organic solvents including methanol ethanol dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and tert butanol tba were also obtained besides di water 2 2 in situ epr tests the epr spectra were recorded at 20 c equipped with circulating water system to maintain the temperature and the epr spectrometer was operated at an x band frequency of 9 84 ghz spectrometer parameters were as follows sweep width of 100 g center field of 3505 g sweep time of 30 or 60 s modulation amplitude of 1 g modulation frequency of 100 khz receiver gain of 30 db microwave attention of 25 db convention time of 12 64 ms and time constant of 5 12 ms matlab software version r2021a and the easyspin package version 5 2 33 were used to analyze and simulate the obtained epr data specifically the original data were imported by the easyspin program in the matlab and then the simulation parameters were set the g value of radical was set as 2 0055 2 0065 the magnetic core of radical was set as 1 h and 14 n according to dmpo capture agent ooh and hso4 need to be increased by 1h the hyperfine coupling constant an and ah were obtained directly from the test spectrum 3 results and discussion 3 1 radical signals recognition in epr spectrum as a radical trapping agent dmpo can capture short lived radicals and convert them to stable dmpo radical addition products spulber and schlick 2010 the radical labeled as r prefers to attack the c n bond of dmpo molecule structure shown in fig s3 and add on α c and then the free electron will transfer to n o group to form dmpo adduct radical dmpo r villamena et al 2005 the spectral signal of dmpo r detected by epr is isotropic and has an average g factor around 2 0055 2 0065 where g is the spectroscopic splitting factor and can be used to determine the central magnetic field in combination with microwave frequency makino et al 1991 quintanilha 1985 the free electron of dmpo adduct is affected by the magnetic interaction of the surrounding magnetic nuclei nβ and hβ atoms in dmpo mainly the fermi contact interaction contributed by the s orbital electrons nβ and hβ of dmpo adduct can split into 3 and 2 spectral lines based on hyperfine splitting law respectively fig s4 the differences in electronegativity and structure of radical group r are finally exhibited as parameters of hyperfine coupling constant anβ and ahβ spectral width sw and line width lw 3 2 hydroxyl radical and hydroperoxyl radical in uv h2o2 system uv h2o2 is a classic aop system for water treatment in which oh and ooh are primary radicals after activation yuan et al 2009 the quantum yield of h2o2 decomposition at 254 nm is 1 0 table s1 zhang et al 2019a in uv aops the quantum yield φ is an important parameter to evaluate the photos unitization efficiency text s2 oh is mainly generated from the homolytic cleavage of the peroxy bond eq 1 with a bond dissociation energy of 213 kj mol in addition ooh would also be generated along with side reaction k 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 eq 2 mierzwa et al 2018 wang et al 2022 1 h 2 o 2 uv 2 oh 2 h 2 o 2 oh ooh h 2 o 3 ooh o 2 h 4 c h 3 oh oh uv c h 2 oh h 2 o epr tests indicated that dmpo didn t react with h2o2 in dark fig 2 a while under uv light irradiation a quartet signal with the intensity of 1 2 2 1 was clearly observed and the signal intensity increased with time the generated signal was assigned to oh with an ah 14 9 gauss g and the total spectral width of 45 g 0 2 g fig 2b liu et al 2016 the signal of dmpo oh can be preserved for another 5 min after the lamp was turned off fig 2a however ooh cannot be detected for this system in water matrix because the reaction rate constant between dmpo and oh k 3 4 109 m 1 s 1 was much higher than ooh k 30 m 1 s 1 in water buettner 1990 fontmorin et al 2016 besides the dmpo adduct dmpo ooh can easily decompose into dmpo oh k 4 9 106 m 1 s 1 buettner 1990 however the dmpo ooh spectrum cannot be masked by that of dmpo oh as the total spectral width of dmpo ooh spectrum was narrower 40 g presenting as a twelve fold peak after simulation in fig 2b an 14 g ah 11 g and ahγ 1 5 g in addition the experimental dmpo ooh spectrum showed different spectral signals fig s5 due to the different test conditions solvents and parameters ah and ahγ the total spectral width of 40 g and ahγ 1 5 g are the characteristic signals for ooh therefore it cannot accurately estimate if ooh produced in water solution due to detection limit and organic solvents like methanol and dmso was further applied to identify ooh typically the spectrum of ooh was detected in methanol solution an 14 g ah 10 g ahγ 1 5 g in the simulation and lw 0 3 fig 2c however ooh pka 4 8 ooh o2 h could transform into o2 by deprotonation eq 3 he et al 2020 the different from dmpo ooh and dmpo o2 are discussed in text s3 the most prominent characteristic of dmpo ooh is the existence of a third magnetic nucleus hγ which is different from dmpo o2 fig s6 according to the hyperfine splitting law the magnetic effect of hγ will be further superimposed on the original spectrum which is characterized by small peaks near each peak fig s7 in methanol solvent matrix for ooh detection another important challenge is how to distinguish the different signals of ooh and hydroxylated methyl radical ch2oh under uv light irradiation the α h of methanol can be abstracted by oh to form ch2oh eq 4 levy et al 2012 the total spectral width of dmpo ch2oh was simulated as 52 g an 15 6 g and ah 20 8 g fig 2d larger than that of dmpo ooh 40 g characteristic of dmpo ch2oh spectrum is also discussed in detail in text s3 and figs s8 and s9 therefore to prevent the interference of ch2oh excessive water in methanol solution needs to be avoided another interfering radical is ch3 when dmso was applied as solvent as oh would attack the methyl group of dmso for ch3 formation fig s10 only ch3 was detected but no signal of ooh at 1 min further confirmed that ooh came from the secondary reaction eq 2 in uv h2o2 system fig s11 the characteristic parameters of ch3 and ooh in dmso were obtained by simulation analysis fig s12 dmpo ooh an 13 g ah 9 g ahγ 1 7 g and dmpo ch3 an 15 g ah 21 g in conclusion for uv h2o2 system oh can be directly captured and well identified in water but detection of ooh should be conducted in organic solvents such as methanol and dmso in methanol solution ooh can be detected directly but it is easy to be incorrectly identified as deprotonated o2 the most important feature of ooh is the small peak assigned to hγ oh will be totally quenched in pure methanol solvent while it will transform into ch2oh with a spectral width 50 g in mixed water methanol matrix oh in dmso solution will directly transform into ch3 which has a similar signal characteristic parameters to ch2oh 3 3 sulfate radical in uv pds and uv pms systems sodium pds na2s2o8 and potassium pds k2s2o8 have the similar symmetrical structure as h2o2 with bond o o dissociation energy of 92 kj mol so4 is the primary radical after uv activation of pds eq 5 wang and wang 2018 in addition so4 can further react with oh k 7 107 m 1 s 1 to generate oh eqs 6 and 7 yang et al 2014 while reaction with h2o is negligible due to much low rate constant k 2 103 s 1 gao et al 2020 therefore ph has a great effect on the radical transformation and so4 is more likely to exist under acidic condition 5 s 2 o 8 2 uv 2 s o 4 6 s o 4 o h so 4 2 oh 7 s o 4 h 2 o so 4 2 oh h 8 dmpo s o 4 o h so 4 2 dmpo oh 9 s o 4 h hs o 4 10 dmpo s o 4 h dmpo hs o 4 11 hso 5 uv s o 4 oh epr test clearly indicated the generation of so4 in uv pds system first while the signal of so4 then gradually converted to oh signal along time fig 3 a after light turn off for 5 min almost all so4 signal converted to dmpo oh indicating dmpo oh had higher stability than dmpo so4 fagan et al 2022 therefore in the uv pms or uv pds system incorrect conclusion on production of oh may be drawn because i the dmpo oh signal may attribute to conversion from so4 to oh eqs 6 and 7 ii dmpo so4 can also transform into dmpo oh through hydrolysis nucleophilic substitution and intramolecular cleavage reaction eq 8 and fig s13 gao et al 2020 zamora and villamena 2012 however these two transformations form so4 to ho or from dmpo so4 to dmpo ho is hard to distinguish in the reaction both for uv pms and uv pds systems after the light was turned off the increase of dmpo ho signal can only be attributed to the conversion of dmpo so4 due to the much longer half lifetime of dmpo so4 1 min than so4 30 40 μs through simulation the combined spectrum of oh an ah 14 9 g and so4 an 13 8 g ah 10 1 g ahγ 1 4 g ahγ 0 8 g was also obtained fig 3b so4 is the key radical to be identified in uv pds or uv pms system for epr analysis but its existing form has not well illustrated previously as the protonated species hso4 may play a more important role similar to ooh strictly speaking the spectrum of captured signal fig 3b should be attributed to dmpo hso4 due to the evident spectral signal of hγ fig s14 however it is not represented the existence of hso4 in aqueous solution owing to its relatively low pka value of 2 0 hso4 so4 h wang et al 2016 hγ has been widely reported in the analysis of so4 gao et al 2020 wei et al 2017 the dmpo hso4 signal can come from 1 protonation of so4 eq 9 and then captured by dmpo or 2 protonation of dmpo adduct dmpo so4 eq 10 the protonation process is more likely to occur in dmpo adduct eq 10 because spectral signals of dmpo hso4 with two hγ were still detected in strong alkaline condition of ph 10 fig s15 due to the reaction between dmpo so4 and h the split signal of hγ in the dmpo hso4 spectrum was the most obvious distinguishing feature fig s16 actually the protonation of dmpo so4 to form dmpo hso4 eq 10 can easily occur so the captured so4 generally appears in the form of dmpo hso4 in epr spectrum figs s15 s17 the dmpo hso4 adduct is more stable due to intramolecular hydrogen bond compared with dmpo so4 zamora and villamena 2012 although only one hγ atom existed in the molecular structure of dmpo hso4 fig s18 signals assigned to two hγ appeared in epr spectrum fig s17 which was caused by the angle between dmpo and hso4 as discussed in text s4 moreover in water solution although so4 can be identified it is difficult to accurately analyze the signal characteristics of so4 due to the overlapped signal of dmpo oh fig 3a and b therefore another solvent is needed for further analysis to avoid the interference of oh previous study reported that addition of 5 v v dmso in water could convert oh into ch3 thus realizing simultaneous identification of so4 and oh gao et al 2020 in addition dmso can block the conversion of so4 to oh due to the absence of oh eq 6 zhou et al 2020 so dmso can be used as an inhibitor in uv pms or uv pds system walger et al 2021 therefore accurate detection of so4 without the interference of oh can be achieved in dmso matrix although dmso may also react with so4 resulting in quench effect the higher reaction rate of so4 addition on dmpo and remarkable dmpo so4 signal lead to accurate identification of this radical gao et al 2020 westwood et al 2019 yuan et al 2015 fig 3c displays the spectrum of radicals produced in uv pds system using dmso solvent and only so4 was identified an 13 g ah 9 1 g ahγ 1 4 g and ahγ 0 8 g while no oh and ch3 signals were observed therefore the results directly prove only so4 can be produced after radical homolytic cleavage from pds as shown in eq 6 in addition the key parameters of dmpo so4 in epr spectrum are the values of ah and hγ where ah of so4 is up to 9 g fig 3c unlike uv pds radical homolytic cleavage of peroxy bond in pms can directly generate so4 and oh simultaneously eq 11 pms molecule has an asymmetric structure with a higher peroxy bond dissociation energy of 377 kj mol lee et al 2020 resulting in a quantum yield of 0 52 at light wavelength of 254 nm for pms compared with 1 4 for pds table s1 wang and wang 2018 lower quantum yield for uv pms system suggested relatively weaker signals of so4 and oh compared that in uv pds spectrum under same experimental analytical conditions fig 3d for the uv pms system in water solution the formation of so4 cannot be identified directly and clearly so pms with high concentration and organic solvent dmso are then introduced results are discussed in text s5 and figs s19 s21 in uv pds or uv pms systems strictly speaking the captured spectral signal of so4 should be assigned to dmpo hso4 moreover the signal of dmpo so4 will be transform into that of dmpo oh in water matrix so accurate identification of so4 can be achieved in organic solvent e g dmso matrix to inhibit the reaction of so4 with oh h2o in dmso solvent complete dmpo so4 signal can be clearly observed especially for the most prominent two hγ furthermore in this system with the coexistence of so4 and oh one common misunderstanding also needs be clarified is that the ratio of the signal intensities cannot be applied to represent the concentration ratio of the two radicals resulting from the transformation of oh from so4 and convention of dmpo so4 to dmpo oh signal 3 4 acetyloxyl and acetylperoxyl radicals in uv paa system the peroxy bond dissociation energy of paa 159 kj mol is weaker than that of h2o2 213 kj mol and the quantum yield of uv activation at wavelength of 254 nm is 0 88 table s1 wu et al 2020 various radicals mainly oh ch3c o o ch3c o oo and ch3 can be produced in paa based aop systems but there are few direct evidences on generation of alkoxy radicals in uv paa system until now generally a typical uv paa system includes several radical chain reactions eqs 12 14 ao et al 2021 cai et al 2017 wu et al 2020 and therefore ch3c o o ch3c o oo ch3 and oh are the key radicals to be accurately identified in this system similar to other peroxides the homolytic reaction of paa under uv irradiation can also produce ch3c o o and oh first cai et al 2017 eq 12 however previous studies widely claimed that ch3c o oo could be the dominant radical in this system for example huang s group elucidated radicals production mechanism in uv paa system through experimental data and reaction kinetics modeling and they claimed ch3c o oo was the most abundant radical and played the most important role in organic compounds degradation wu et al 2020 the reasons why ch3c o oo is the dominant radical are 1 both produced ch3c o o and oh will undergo a further reaction with paa to generate ch3c o oo eqs 13 and 14 wu et al 2020 2 ch3c o o will rapidly decompose to ch3 with a high reaction rate constant of 2 3 105 s 1 eq 15 ao et al 2021 du et al 2022 therefore to deeply understanding the mechanisms on radicals production and reaction with organic pollutants in the uv paa aop system identification of ch3c o o and ch3c o oo is the most important proposition 12 c h 3 c o ooh uv c h 3 c o o oh 13 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o ooh c h 3 c o oo c h 3 c o oh 14 oh c h 3 c o ooh c h 3 c o oo h 2 o 15 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o 2 16 c h 3 o 2 ooc h 3 for epr analysis in water matrix fig 4 a paa did not react with dmpo and no relevant spectrum was detected in dark after uv irradiation several peaks indexed to oh and ch3 an 15 9 g ah 22 8 g in the simulation appeared fig 4b ch3 came from the self decomposition of ch3c o o as shown in eq 15 and identification of ch3 indicated the generation of ch3c o o the signals of oh and ch3 gradually increased as irradiation time prolonged which still could be detected after uv light was turned off for 5 min fig 4a suggesting the stability of dmpo oh and dmpo ch3 unfortunately in uv paa system we did not directly detect the signal of ch3c o oo in water solution it is different from the results obtained in homogenous co ii paa system in which we successfully identify ch3c o oo through epr fig s22 du et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to establish radicals analytical method in other organic solvents to further identify ch3c o oo in methanol solution fig s23 although the signal of dmpo ch3c o oo was observed it was not obvious due to the interference of strong dmpo ch3 signal in dmso solution fig s24 only ch3 but no ch3c o oo was detected previous studies have reported high viscosity of solvent can lead to more obvious spectrum of macromolecular radical akdogan et al 2010 thus ethanol and tba with higher viscosity were selected as solvents to further detect ch3c o oo and the results exactly indicated the formation of ch3c o oo fig 4c different from dmpo oh and dmpo ch3 in water the spectrum of ch3c o oo belongs to dmpo ooch3 model fig s25 presenting a total spectral width of 37 g and hyperfine splitting constant of anβ 13 5 g ahβ 8 5 g and ahγ 1 5 g buettner 1987 therefore another possible radical produced in this system was methylperoxyl radical ooch3 converted from the rapid reaction between generated ch3 and dissolved oxygen o2 k 4 7 109 m 1 s 1 eq 16 as reported before zhang and huang 2020 ooch3 also has a high steady state concentration 2 7 10 2 10 9 m in the uv paa process according to the kinetics modeling zhang and huang 2020 in terms of epr spectrum for dmpo adducts the difference between dmpo ch3c o oo and dmpo ooch3 is not obvious because they both belong to dmpo oor model and dmpo capture cannot distinguish the r group in the dmpo oor model in epr spectra we further demonstrate the production of ch3c o oo without the interference of ooch3 as the ooch3 is formed in the presence of oxygen eq 16 an oxygen free condition was constructed by introducing nitrogen into the ethanol test system to block the generation of ooch3 the result indicates that the intensity of dmpo adduct signal didn t significantly change after introducing nitrogen fig s26 which determined the negligible contribution of ooch3 to the signal although ethanol and tba were used as solvents for radical detection ethanol radical and tba radical almost could not be detected in uv paa system both of them are typical carbon center radicals which have specific signals with spectral width 45 g simulated in fig s27 therefore application of ethanol and tba as solvents are available for ch3c o oo identification ahβ 8g and the existence of hγ are the most typical characteristics of ch3c o oo compared with ch3c o o further analysis confirmed that the spectrum parameters of ch3c o oo captured in ethanol and tert butanol were consistent besides self decomposition ch3c o o can also eliminate through a self dimerization to form peroxide product fig s28 thus also leading to hard determination of ch3c o o due to extremely low concentration therefore the current method is still unable to directly detect ch3c o o the simulated spectrum of ch3c o o belongs to dmpo och3 model fig 4d which has a total spectral width 34 5 g ah 7 5 g and an 13 5 g for the identification of unstable radicals such as ch3c o o through epr the capture process of epr signal needs to fully consider the applicability of capturing agent radical concentration and solvent condition 5 tert butoxycarbonyl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide bmpo could be applied as a possible capturing agent for the future analysis as a more stable bmpo ch3c o o adduct with longer half lifetime is formed keszler et al 2003 in the future we will further explore the detection methods for these unstable radicals including application of characteristic capturing agents or operation under specific test conditions e g low temperature and inert gas atmosphere in total for uv paa system abundant radicals can be captured using different solvents where oh and ch3 can be directly detected in water however ch3c o oo cannot be clearly identified in water methanol and dmso due to the interference of ch3 and consumption by self dimerization ethanol and tert butyl alcohol of higher viscosity can be used as solvents to accurately detect ch3c o oo in addition for the epr signals of primary radicals in paa system fig 4d the total spectral width of oxygen centered radicals e g ch3c o oo and ch3c o o is 45 g while that of carbon centered radical ch3 is 45 g in addition atom with higher electronegativity has stronger ability to attract electron li and xue 2006 the electronegativity carbon 2 55 is lower than that of oxygen 3 44 resulting in the weaker electron attraction and greater ah of dmpo adduct the in situ epr method established in this work provides direct evidence on formation of acetylperoxyl radicals in paa aop system which can be applied as a method guidance for the identification of alkoxy and alkylperoxyl radicals in other aop systems 3 5 periodate radical and hydrated electron in uv io4 system generally the primary radicals in uv io4 system are reported as io3 and io4 which play key roles in degradation of organic pollutants djaballah et al 2021 however until now there has been no direct evidence on formation of these two radicals in this system so method on epr analysis is eagerly needed in water solution fig 5 a io4 oxidation potential of 1 6 v could directly oxidize dmpo to form dmpox fig s29 choi et al 2018 in addition fig 5b shows the simulation results and the obvious triplet peak was attributed to dmpoo an 15 5 g after photo induced oxidation of dmpo under strong oxidation condition e g in the presence of io4 li et al 2015 the formation of dmpoo and dmpox is a characteristic for the presence of strong oxidative agent in the system discussed in text s6 but it cannot be applied as a criterion for evaluation of io3 and io4 interestingly a carbon centric radical was also formed in uv io4 system according to an 16 2 g and ah 23 6 g 2 min in fig 5a zeng et al 2020 it is clear that no other carbon source was introduced in this system except for dmpo implying dmpo was oxidized to a carbon centric radical i e dmpo degradation radical dmpod due to the existence of hβ in dmpod fig s30 the c n bond in dmpo molecule was most likely to cleavage based on the total spectral width of 56 g dmpod belonged to a saturated alkane radical fig s31 which may be attributed to the strong oxidation ability of io3 and io4 further analysis of the 2 min s spectrum revealed that oh was also identified fig s31 converted from the protonation of o oh o h pka 11 9 zhang et al 2021 o will quickly convert to its protonated form oh under acidic neutral and weakly alkaline conditions eq 19 the epr signal spectrum of dmpo o is same as that of dmpo oh where the effect of hγ on hyperfine splitting of an and ah is negligible in the dmpo ohγ to the best of our knowledge no previous studies have clearly illustrated the existence of radicals especially io3 and io4 in uv io4 system after 5 min s irradiation the signal of dmpoo continued to increase while the signal of dmpo oh and dmpod became relatively weak io3 io4 oh and hydrated electron e aq are detected in uv io4 system where io3 and io4 are inferred as the main active species for the transformation from dmpo to dmpoo to further investigate the roles of io3 and io4 in formation of dmpoo signal in uv io3 system was detected as in this system only io3 oh and hydrated electron e aq can be produced but no io4 boukhedoua et al 2021 as shown in fig s32 dmpo io3 signal was detected in dmso solution in the uv io3 system however no signal assigned to dmpoo was obtained in water fig s33 therefore io3 cannot induce oxidation of dmpo to dmpoo which directly confirmed the contribution of io4 to dmpo oxidation in the uv io4 system moreover previous researches also reported that io3 mainly exhibited reduction ability haddad et al 2019 sun et al 2017 while its contribution to oxidation of target substances was limited liu et al 2022 the continuous increase of dmpoo signal was attributed to the activation of dmpo io4 adduct under uv light showing a strong oxygenation ability fig s34 after light off only extremely weak signal of dmpox was observed in water matrix no signals assigned to primary reactive species like io3 and io4 were detected so organic solvent of methanol was further introduced interestingly a weak signal attributed to io4 was captured in dark fig s35 as the hyperfine splitting constants were anβ 14 0 g and ahβ 8 0 g formation of io4 further confirmed the strong oxidation ability and electron transfer of io4 however the signal disappeared after uv light irradiation attributed to quenching by other generated radical or further transformation dmso solvent was further applied to evaluate if another i related radical such as io3 was produced fig 5c indicates that io4 did not react with dmso as no signal was observed in dark a totally different spectrum was obtained with light on besides weak signal of dmpo io4 strong signal assigned to io3 was obtained with a total spectral width of 41 g ah of 12 9 g and an of 14 2 g to our knowledge it is the first time to detect the iodate related radicals in uv io4 system by epr hydrated electron is another important reactive species that widely reported liu et al 2021 yu et al 2018 which can be captured by tempo which is a stable radical showing a triple peak with intensity of 1 1 1 in water an 17 3 g fig s36 after capturing hydrated electron tempo will transform into a singlet organic matter without paramagnetism fig 5d presents that the signal of tempo did not decrease with addition of io4 in dark suggesting io4 did not react with tempo in addition uv irradiation alone also had no effect on the tempo signal and the intensity did not change within 10 mins irradiation fig s37 however after the light was turned on the signal decreased rapidly and tempo 100 μμ was completely transformed after 5 min fig 5d which directly confirmed the existence of hydrated electron in the reaction system the capture of hydrated electron by tempo in this system was further verified by an ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography mass mass system uplc ms ms for product detection methods shown in text s7 results presented in fig s38 and table s2 tempo was detected m z 157 14607 rt 9 04 min esi and its concentration decreased along reaction time figs s38a c and s39 the reduction product temp m z 142 15891 rt 5 68 min esi after hydrated electron attack was successfully detected figs s38d e and s39 which was formed via a deoxygenation and subsequent hydrogenation at the n site fig 5d in addition the conversion rate from tempo to temp obtained by uplc ms ms was consistent with the elimination rate of tempo signal got by through epr method table s3 confirming that the disappearance of tempo signal in epr spectrum was attributed to addition of hydrated electron rather than iodine related radicals attack actually all the reactive species io3 io4 oh and hydrated electron were generated in the uv io4 system meanwhile however different detection conditions e g solvents and capturing agents should be applied to identify specific species the selective production of reactive species also can be realized through the control of water chemistry factors such as ph which is the key parameter affecting the formation of species particularly the identification of activation pathway for generation of io4 and hydrated electron is of great significance in this aop process for pollutants degradation based on the aforementioned results the radical formation and evolution in uv io4 system can be inferred to procced through two pathways fig s40 the first pathway has been reported by previous studies merouani and hamdaoui 2021 zhang et al 2021 cleavage of i o bond for the production of io3 and o eq 17 and then o can be easily protonated to generate oh gao et al 2020 eq 19 moreover radicals transformation to generate io4 from io3 and oh may also occur eqs 20 and 21 the second pathway is confirmed based on epr analysis of this study uv light can directly activate io4 to form io4 and hydrated electron e aq eq 18 this work for first time provided the direct evidences on formation of io3 io4 and hydrated electron in uv io4 system by epr analysis in addition a new io4 activation pathway under uv irradiation was confirmed based on successful detection of io4 and hydrated electron for the first time 17 io 4 uv io 3 o 18 io 4 uv i o 4 e aq 19 o h oh 20 oh io 4 i o 4 o h 21 i o 3 io 4 i o 4 io 3 3 6 summary of radical signals in epr spectrum as described above dmpo can effectively identify the typical radicals in uv based aops system and further capture unconventional radicals by application of organic solvents e g methanol dmso and ethanol according to the hyperfine coupling constant of an and ah the types of radicals can be clearly differentiated fig 6 a in the aops for water treatment the generated radicals generally possess a structure of o or c centered ao et al 2021 deng and zhao 2015 to determine the speciation of dmpo capture radicals in epr spectrum dmpo oh can be selected as a criterion due to its specificity as a quartet peak caused by the overlapping of an ah and a total spectral width of 45 g is the typical characteristic fig 6c e lauricella and tuccio 2020 thus radicals with the total spectral width 45 g are classified as c centered radicals while that 45 g are classified as o centered radicals in addition radical with weaker electronegativity has higher ah value table 1 summarizes the key physicochemical properties of radicals and parameters of dmpo captured radicals in the four uv based aops systems the total spectral width is two time of the sum value of an and ah and the total spectral width and ah of typical radicals are ranked as ch3 23 g oh 15 g io3 12 9 g o2 11 g ooh 9 11 g io4 9 10 g so4 9 10 g ch3c o oo 8 5 g ch3c o o 7 5 g fig 6d for ooh and hso4 hγ is the characteristic parameter to describe them compared with o2 and so4 respectively however for identification of dmpo captured oxygen center radical through epr only the first element boned to oxygen in radicals such as hydroxyl oh alkoxy oc alkyl peroxide oo etc can be distinguished fig 6b for accurate identification of all kinds of radicals a comprehensive strategy is needed with consideration of trapping agent epr instrument operation condition solvent condition and even radicals formation mechanism 4 conclusion this study presented an overall summary on identification of radicals by epr in typical uv based homogenous aop systems and carefully discussed the challenges in this area the obtained findings can provide a reference for identification of radicals in such uv aops and even in other aops with similar radicals production the primary and important findings are 1 in uv h2o2 system ooh and o2 are also produced and the roles cannot be ignored accurate identification of these two radicals can be achieved in alcohol solvents while the interference of alcohol radicals e g ch2oh and ch3 needs to be avoided 2 in uv pms and uv pds systems so4 can be accurately identified in specific organic solvent dmso without the interference of oh and transformation of so4 to oh is a big challenge for radical identification in this system 3 in uv paa system ch3c o oo can be effectively detected in alcohol solvents ethanol or tba while the signal of ch3 detected in water can be applied as an alternative characteristic signal of ch3c o o due to its self decomposition 4 in uv io4 system two activation pathways were proposed based on radical indemnification i e formation of 1 io3 and oh and 2 io4 and hydrated electron the iodine related radicals can be efficiently identified in dmso while the hydrated electron can be accurately and quantitively detected using tempo as trapping agent in the future for accurate identification of radicals by epr specific analytical conditions should be considered according to the characteristics of the aop system including type of radical trapping agent solvent matrix reaction time analytical operation temperature in

15734,a lengthy start up period has been one of the key obstacles limiting the application of the anammox process in this investigation a nitrification denitrification sludge was used to start up the anammox egsb process the transformation process from nitrification denitrification sludge to anammox granule sludge was explored through the aspects of nitrogen removal performance granule properties microbial community structure and evolution route a successful start up of the anammox process was achieved after 94 days of reactor operation the highest nitrogen removal rate nrr obtained was 7 25 0 16 gn l d at a nitrogen loading rate nlr of 8 0 gn l d and the corresponding nitrogen removal efficiency was a high 90 61 1 99 the results of the microbial analysis revealed significant changes in anammox bacteria nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in the sludge notably the anammox bacteria abundance increased from 2 5 to 29 0 during the operation and candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia were the dominant genera distinct different successions on candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were also observed over the long term period in addition the settling performance anammox activity and biomass retention capacity of the granules were significantly enhanced during this process and the corresponding granule evolution route was also proposed the results in this study indicate the feasibility of using available seed sludge source for the fast transformation of anammox granules it is beneficial to the large scale application of anammox process and the utilization of excess sludge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox process start up microbial community evolution granule sludge egsb process data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction for decades the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process has been widely studied and adopted in the high efficiency nitrogen removal of municipal wastewater lotti et al 2015b reino et al 2018 wu et al 2021 various achievements have also been made for the treatment of centrates such as landfill leachate li et al 2018 and digestion liquid song et al 2022 as well as of industrial wastewater with a high ammonia concentration and low c n lackner et al 2014 the rapid developments in the anammox process can be attributed to the high level of research interest in the process due to its high nitrogen removal efficiency and energy saving compared with the conventional process specifically it represents a 100 saving of organic carbon and a 60 saving of aeration ma et al 2016 and nitrogen removal efficiency has been reported at 44 9 0 3 kgn m3 d in the lab scale zhang et al 2018 and 10 71 kgn m3 d in the full scale van der star et al 2007 however there are some challenges in the practical application that need to be addressed among them the lengthy start up period due to the low growth rate of anammox bacteria is a problem which urgently requires a solution adams et al 2022 guo et al 2022 in response to this problem different studies have focused on the reactor configuration the inoculated sludge and the additives to accelerate the start up of the anammox process in one study it was pointed out that the advantage of the membrane bioreactor mbr is that the anammox bacteria enrichment benefits from its high sludge retention property thus reducing the start up period tao et al 2012 however in full scale applications the operating cost of the mbr reactor is relatively high and the sequencing batch reactor sbr and up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor tend to be preferred as installations lackner et al 2014 while it has been shown in some studies that adding a small amount of anammox sludge to the seed sludge could speed up the start up miao et al 2020 wang et al 2020 this is not feasible when the anammox sludge source is not available besides that various additives such as hydrazine zekker et al 2021 ferrous iron bi et al 2014 and reduced graphene oxide yin et al 2016 have been used to accelerate the anammox start up but the cost of materials needs to be considered in practical applications and poor control of the dosage has been shown to have negative effects zhang et al 2018 currently large amounts of anammox seed sludge are not available in most countries kocamemi et al 2018 therefore it is of great significance to study the transformation from other types of sludge to anammox dominated sludge since there are many sludges that are more readily available than anammox sludge moreover the granulation of sludge has been reported to be a useful strategy to improve the settling performance and biomass retention capacity of the sludge manonmani and joseph 2018 tang et al 2017 which is conducive to retaining the anammox bacteria in the reactor and shortening the start up period in this study a nitrification denitrification sludge which was an excess sludge from the fluidized bed reactor conducting a high loading nitrogen removal process was used as the seed sludge to achieve the fast start up of anammox process the focus of this study is on the feasibility of the seed sludge source that can be obtained in large quantities for the fast formation of anammox granules which is beneficial to the large scale application of the anammox process and also a strategy for the utilization of excess sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and inoculum sludge the start up process was performed in an expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor with a working volume of 5 5 l fig s1 the influent was pumped by a fp100 1515 peristaltic pump as one corporation japan from the bottom of the reactor during the whole operation the hrt was adjusted in the range of 4 26 4 h the operating temperature was controlled at 35 0 5 c by a ntt 20s water bath heater tokyo rikakikai co ltd japan the inoculum sludge came from the fluidized bed reactor in the toshima western

52 4 741 1 mg l respectively and the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were 100 1334 mg l and 25 60 mg l respectively during the long term operation the water samples were taken every two days and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c after being filtered by a 0 45 µm membrane filter an agilent 7000 capillary electrophoresis ce system agilent technologies wilmington usa was used to analyzed the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations an agilent 720 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes system agilent technologies wilmington usa was used to detect the phosphorus and calcium before the icp oes analysis the water samples were pretreated by nitric acid and filtered by the 0 45 µm membrane filter again to remove the interferences caused by organic matters according to the apha standard methods yamaguchi et al 2016 after the pretreatment an icp oes analysis was conducted at wavelengths of 213 618 and 317 933 nm for phosphorus and calcium respectively 2 3 characterization of sludge granules the suspended solids ss and volatile suspended solids vss concentrations of the sludge were determined in every phases according to the apha methods apha awwa wef 2017 due to small size of the initial sludge the granule size was detected by a mastersizer 3000 particle size analyzer malvern panalytical ltd uk after the long term operation the granule size distribution was analyzed by a series of sieves with 0 25 0 5 1 0 2 0 2 8 mm apertures the settling velocity of the sludge was detected after sieving and by measuring the settling time 10 per size

different heights top middle and bottom part of the egsb reactor were also tested the test was performed using sealed vials with a reaction volume of 100 ml the reaction solution had the same composition as the influent of the egsb reactor except that the concentrations of tn and tp were fixed at 250 mg l and 25 mg l respectively the solution was aerated with nitrogen gas prior to the sludge addition to ensure an anaerobic reaction environment all the tests were conducted at 35 c and at least two replicates were used to ensure the accuracy of the results the anammox activity of the

germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term performance of the egsb reactor 3 1 1 nitrogen removal performance during the operation the egsb reactor was inoculated with 3 l of fluidized bed type nitrification denitrification sludge and started at an nlr of 1 0 gn l d table 1 and fig 1 illustrates the whole operating conditions and nitrogen removal performance in phase i the reactor showed very poor and fluctuating tn removal during the first 60 days the removal efficiency of nitrogen especially nh4 n was low and basically no no3 n left over in the effluent indicating that the denitrification was dominated at this time after 60 days when the nlr was decreased to 0 112 gn l d the tn removal efficiency gradually increased from 27 48 to 60 20 fig 1 c this indicates that the proportion of anammox bacteria in the seed sludge was extremely low thus a lower nlr was conducive to the start up in this situation in phase ii the nlr was increased from 0 18 to 2 5 gn l d within 80 days resulting in an nrr from 0 15 to 2 18 gn l d fig 1 b however when the nlr was raised to be higher than 1 0 gn l d an excessive ph of more than 9 0 occurred because the ph remained not controlled fig 1 a and the free ammonia fa increased rapidly to inhibit the anammox process fig 1 f as a result the inhibition caused a deterioration of the reactor performance in phase iii meanwhile some floating agglomerated sludge appeared in the upper part of the reactor fig s2 which was caused by the lack of inorganic components in the process of granule growth the agglomeration of sludge is also known to impede the settling performance of the granules and result in a lower transfer efficiency between the biomass and substrate adams et al 2022 xue et al 2020 therefore a ph control by dilute sulfuric acid and an addition of calcium and phosphorus were added after day 214 to avoid these adverse effects after that the nitrogen removal became stable and a high tn removal efficiency of around 90 was obtained fig 1 c in phase iv the nlr increased rapidly from 3 0 to 8 0 gn l d within 100 days fig 1 b the highest nrr reached 7 25 0 16 gn l d at an nlr of 8 0 gn l d with a tn removal efficiency of 90 61 1 99 fig 1 c the rapid increase in the nrr was inseparable from the formation and growth of anammox granules the granulation process is an important means to enhance the anammox biomass retention in virtue of the aggregation tendency of anammox microorganisms wang et al 2020 and an efficient biomass retainment is a key prerequisite for improving the nitrogen removal performance it has been reported that the inorganic precipitation promoted the anammox biomass enrichment not only as a carrier for the biomass attachment to promote the granulation but also as a promoter to improve the settling performance of the sludge fernández et al 2008 xue et al 2021 in this study it was achieved by introducing calcium and phosphorus precipitation to generate hydroxyapatite hap the removal performance of phosphorus is illustrated in fig s3 and table s1 in phase iii the phosphorus and calcium concentrations were 25 0 mg l and 53 9 mg l respectively and the corresponding ca p ratio was consistent with the reaction formula eq 3 of hap in phase iv the phosphorus concentration increased with the nlr ranging from 25 0 to 60 0 mg l as a result the tp removal efficiency increased from 41 55 11 42 to 71 03 3 38 the effect of calcium and phosphorus addition on the characteristics of sludge granules will be further discussed in the next section 3 ca2 po4 3 oh ca10 po4 6 oh 2 3 1 2 stoichiometric ratio variation fig 2 illustrates the rs and rp variation during the operation which represents the ratio of consumed no2 n to consumed no2 n and the ratio of produced no3 n to consumed nh4 n respectively according to the anammox reaction formula eq 4 proposed by strous m strous et al 1998 the empirical rs and rp values were 1 32 and 0 26 respectively in this study in phase i the ratios of rs and rp obtained were 1 90 0 91 and 0 16 0 24 respectively which were discrete and largely deviated from the values in the anammox reaction however from phase ii the concentrative degrees of these ratios became increasingly higher until they were in the vicinity of the empirical value and then finally stabilized at 1 26 0 06 and 0 21 0 04 respectively similar phenomena have also been reported in other studies qin et al 2017 wang et al 2021 t wang et al 2020 in which a stable ratio close to the empirical value was also considered to be a sign of the successful start up of anammox overall the successful start up of anammox process was achieved after 94 days of operation and the egsb reactor system was capable of a high nlr of 8 0 gn l d after 300 days 4 1 0 nh4 1 32 no2 0 066 hco3 0 13 h 1 02 n2 0 26 no3 0 066 ch2o0 5n0 15 2 03 h2o 3 1 3 comparison with similar studies on anammox process start up table 2 summarizes the research on the start up of anammox process without mixed with anammox sludge various kinds of seed sludge have been used in the anammox start up process including activated sludge anaerobic digestion sludge denitrifying sludge and their combinations also many studies have employed the strategy of adding accelerators to speed up the anammox process such as reduced graphene oxide rgo yin et al 2016 fes zou et al 2020 and fe3 addition wang et al 2021 notably sludge entrapment by poly vinyl alcohol gel beads demonstrated excellent performance in immobilizing and enriching anammox biomass bae et al 2015 cho et al 2018 while the addition of accelerators has been shown to promote the start up of anammox it would be a cost burden in practical applications note that the temperature for the start up process was generally between 32 and 35 c which is because this is the optimum temperature range for the growth of anammox bacteria sobotka et al 2021 the type of reactor used was mainly uasb type reactor which is due to the excellent stability of uasb reactor towards the substrate shock jin et al 2008 among these similar studies table 2 the difference of this study is that the enhanced start up of the anammox process was achieved by the rapid formation of anammox granules moreover this study focused on the transformation characteristics of microorganisms and the evolution route of sludge granules which will be further discussed in the subsequent sections in terms of nitrogen removal performance and start up speed this study also achieved a relatively high nrr and start up efficiency in the same type of research 3 2 physical characteristic of the sludge in the egsb reactor 3 2 1 morphological characteristic of the sludge granules in this study the egsb reactor has been operated for 366 days fig 3 a illustrates the appearance of the sludge during the operation which was dark brown in phase i after operating for 300 days in phase iv it was obvious that the sludge began to turn red and the granules increased in size anammox bacteria are typically red in color it has been shown that this color is derived from cytochrome c and the chroma has been confirmed to be significantly correlated with the quantity of anammox bacteria and specific anammox activity kang et al 2020 kartal and keltjens 2016 therefore the degree of redness of the sludge can be used to roughly estimate the abundance of anammox bacteria and a higher red chroma indicates enhanced anammox activity in the sludge as shown in fig 3 b the pattern of the sludge granules varied according to the reactor heights and different sizes in phase iv the degree of redness of the sludge deepened from top to bottom in reactor height and from small granules to large granules moreover a cross section of a small red granule was uniformly red while a larger red granule was red on the outside but dark inside these phenomena explain that the enrichment of anammox bacteria spread from the bottom to the top in the reactor and was initially enriched in the surface layer of the granules this is related to the reactor type and operating conditions the up flow type egsb reactor was conducive for the sludge at the bottom to receive more nutrients and the dilution effect of the recirculation on the high concentration substrate prevented the inhibition on anammox bacteria thereby facilitating growth and enrichment lin et al 2019 3 2 2 variation of the sludge concentration fig 4 shows the variation on the total amounts and concentrations of ss vss and inorganics during the operation in phase i the total amount and concentration of the sludge both decreased significantly at the beginning indicating that a large number of heterotrophic and aerobic bacteria died due to the anaerobic and organic deficient environment in phase ii with a low nlr both the amount and concentration of the sludge remained relatively stable however after starting the addition of phosphorus and calcium in phase iii both the total ss and its concentration increased rapidly the hap precipitation increased the proportion of inorganic matter in the sludge granule and although the vss ss ratio decreased it did not affect the biomass concentration of the granule fig 4 b it can be seen that in the late phase iv the total biomass had increased obviously due to the high nrr 3 2 3 granule size distribution and settling velocity in the original sludge the main granule size distribution was from 0 3 to 1 0 mm fig 5 a however after running for 355 days fig 5 b the granule size was dominated by sizes of 1 0 to 2 0 mm the growth in granule size reflected the effective enrichment of biomass on the one hand and played a positive role in the sludge settling on the other hand when the sludge in the reactor is approximated as a sphere the effect of granule size and other factors on the settling performance of sludge can be concluded by the corrected stokes formula eq 5 xu et al 2021a 5 v 4 g ρ s ρ d 3 ρ μ where v is the settling velocity of the granule in fluid cm s g is the gravitational constant cm s2 ρs is the granule density g cm3 ρ is the density of the fluid g cm3 d is the diameter of the granule cm and μ is the empirical drag coefficient it can be seen that both the growth in granule size d and the increase in granule density ρs contribute to the improvement of settling performance which is also consistent with the results obtained in this study fig 5 c among them the settling velocity of sludge was proportional to the granule size and it was higher in the regions where the hap precipitation reaction had preferentially occurred lower part of the reactor more importantly compared with day 1 the average settling velocity of the sludge improved greatly from 31 89 m h to 111 90 m h after day 355 with the inorganics increased from 49 39 g l to 135 26 g l on average compared with other similar studies liang et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 the sludge granules in this study also showed excellent settleability indicating a high biomass retention capacity of the reactor 3 3 variation and distribution of the microbial community in the egsb reactor the microbial community structures of the sludge during the long term operation and from different heights of the reactor as well as with different granule sizes are illustrated in fig 6 at the phylum level fig 6 a there were four main bacterial phyla in the sludge planctomycetes proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes among them proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes which are classified as heterotrophic bacteria have been reported to exist in the anammox systems and live on the extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp produced by biomass decay and metabolism akaboci et al 2018 chen et al 2021 during the long term operation planctomycetes the phylum which the anammox bacteria belong to had a significant increase in the abundance from 21 6 to 44 1 which has also been observed in other reports on the anammox start up niederdorfer et al 2021 wang et al 2021 however nitrospirae the phylum to which nitrifying bacteria belong tang et al 2018 significantly decreased in abundance during the operation this is because the anaerobic condition of the reactor made it difficult for nitrifying bacteria to survive at the genus level fig 6 b it can be seen that candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were the obtained anammox bacteria in the sludge oshiki et al 2016 zhang and okabe 2020 during the long term operation candidatus brocadia was the only anammox bacteria in the beginning after the reactor running for more than 300 days candidatus kuenenia came from behind and surpassed candidatus brocadia in abundance it has been reported that candidatus kuenenia is an affinity k strategist and is dominant at a low substrate concentration while candidatus brocadia conducts a growth rate r strategy and is dominant at a high substrate concentration ali and okabe 2015 van der star et al 2008 in this study the growth of candidatus kuenenia was encouraged due to the low influent concentration early in the reactor operation in addition although the influent tn was increased to more than 1000 mg l after 300 days the high recirculation ratio 11 55 ensured that the actual influent tn concentration was not higher than 250 mg l which provided favorable conditions for the survival of candidatus kuenenia after the long term operation the abundance of anammox bacteria increased greatly from 2 5 to 29 0 indicating the continuous enrichment of anammox bacteria and the successful start up of anammox process in addition due to the anaerobic environment the abundance of nitritation bacteria nitrosomonas and candidatus nitrosymbiomonas and nitrification bacteria nitrospira showed a downward trend with the duration arora et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 this also explains the decrease in biomass at the beginning of the operation fig 4 apparently also partly due to the massive death of aerobic bacteria on the contrary denitratisoma rhodoplanes and afipia which are affiliated to denitrifying bacteria increased with the duration from 2 5 to 13 2 the denitrifying bacteria was able to live on the nitrate in the reactor fahrbach et al 2006 wang et al 2019 and the increasing abundance may have resulted from the increasing nlr of the reactor which allowed more nitrate to be produced from the anammox reaction moreover the eps secreted by denitrifying bacteria was declared to have enhanced the anammox bacteria activity guo et al 2016 illustrating the friendly coexistence between denitrifying bacteria and anammox bacteria there was no obvious difference in the community structure of the sludge from different heights and different granule sizes at the phylum level fig 6 a however at the genus level fig 6 b the abundance of anammox bacteria at the bottom of the reactor 30 7 was higher than that at the top 27 4 the main reason is that the bottom sludge contained a higher percentage of candidatus brocadia 15 2 compared with the top sludge 11 5 which further confirmed that candidatus brocadia is more adaptable to the environment with high substrate concentration bottom of the egsb reactor than candidatus kuenenia for granules of different sizes 1 0 1 0 2 0 and 2 0 mm the abundance of anammox bacteria was basically the same however it is reported that under a low strength wastewater 58 mgn l the anammox bacteria abundance increased when the granule size was below 0 9 mm while it slightly declined with the further increase of granule size zhu et al 2018 the tn concentration in this study was much higher and finally reached 1334 mg l at an nlr of 8 0 gn l d this indicates that the abundance distribution with sizes may be different between high and low strength wastewater which deserves further exploration moreover the proportion of candidatus brocadia in the small granules 1 0 mm was much higher 15 2 compared to 10 6 and 9 7 in the medium granules 1 0 2 0 mm and large granules 2 0 mm respectively this may be attributed to the larger surface area of the small granules enabling them to receive a higher substrate loading which was more conducive to the growth of candidatus brocadia conducting an r strategy 3 4 variation in the anammox activity 3 4 1 anammox activity saa under different nlr the saa of the sludge was tested under the nlrs of 0 5 1 14 1 7 3 0 5 0 and 8 0 gn l d to reveal the improving trajectory of the anammox activity fig 7 when the nlr was lower than 3 0 g l d there was a strongly positive correlation between the anammox activity and the nlr r2 0 9992 with the saa value increased rapidly from 0 00079 to 0 304 gn gvss d a similar correlation was also found between the anammox bacteria abundance and the nlr fig 6 b suggesting that the increased anammox bacteria abundance during this period resulted in the enhanced anammox activity in other single stage and two stage anammox processes an increase in the anammox activity with the abundance of anammox bacteria was also found li et al 2021 miao et al 2020 wang et al 2021 according to lin lin et al 2019 with the increase in the nlr the activity of hydrazine oxidase hzo which uniquely presents in the anammox bacteria was significantly enhanced and the content of the co enzyme heme c also increased when the nlr was higher than 3 0 g l d the saa value stabilized at about 0 3 gn gvss d this may be due to the almost negligible change in the abundance of anammox bacteria after the nlr was 3 0 g l d day 275 allowing the anammox activity to remain at a stable level moreover there is another discovery when combining with the results of the biomass variation fig 4 and the anammox bacteria abundance fig 6 b in the reactor it can be concluded that before the nlr was 3 0 gn l d the capable operating strength of the reactor mainly depended on the anammox bacteria abundance per unit while after the nlr was 3 0 gn l d the capable operating strength mainly relied on the proliferation of the anammox biomass 3 4 2 anammox activity of sludge with different sizes and heights sludge granules from different heights of the reactor top middle and bottom were sieved into three groups 1 0 mm 1 0 2 0 mm and 2 0 mm respectively to conduct the activity tests and the results showed strongly differences in the saa value fig 8 the sludge with granules of larger sizes obviously obtained a higher anammox activity which is consistent with another report chen et al 2016 a study has shown that in the range of 0 2 4 0 mm a larger granule size is associated with a more dense distribution of anammox bacteria on the surface layer xu et al 2021a this may well be the reason for the stronger anammox activity however it has also been pointed out that larger granules tend to be associated with lower mass transfer efficiencies between the substrate and the anammox bacteria in the subsurface layer shi et al 2017 another study by xu xu et al 2021b showed that in the size range between 0 59 and 3 44 mm the anammox activity first increased and then decreased with the granule of 2 17 mm having the highest anammox activity in this study since the granule size of the sludge was mainly distributed between 1 0 and 2 0 mm fig 5 a it is likely that the high anammox activity of the granules in this size range was the reason for the efficient operation of egsb reactor besides that the saa values of the top and middle part were higher than that of bottom part this result is contrary to the conclusion made by ma ma et al 2017 that the sludge showed the highest value at the bottom part and the lowest at the top part of reactor a study by zhang zhang et al 2016b pointed out that the anammox activity decreased under a high substrate condition and also resulted in a longer lag phase since the biomass required more time to adapt to the high strength environment the influent tn reported by ma ma et al 2017 was in the range of 300 700 mg l which was much lower than the tn concentration 1334 mg l in phase iv of this study as a result the substrate shock received by the bottom sludge was much higher in this study resulting in a lower saa value of the sludge 3 5 granule evolution route in the egsb reactor based on the above mentioned results it is concluded that the apparent redness fig 3 the abundance of anammox bacteria fig 6 and the anammox activity fig 7 of the sludge were all demonstrated an outstanding improvement during the long term operation microscopic and fish observations of the mature sludge granules were performed in phase iv and the images of a typical sludge granule are shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the surface layer of the sludge was redder in color while the inner layer was characterized by darker sludge fig 9 a cryosections of the sludge were subjected to fish analysis to obtain the distribution of different bacteria fig 9 b g a probe named amx820 red specific for ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis and ca brocadia anammoxidans and a mixture of eub338 i iv and eub338 ii iii probes green to detect all bacteria were used in the analysis the outer layer of the sludge was rich in anammox bacteria fig 9 b d and the red brightness of the surface layer was higher which also indicates a stronger anammox activity ma et al 2020 in contrast the abundance of anammox bacteria in the inner part was lower and the abundance of non anammox bacteria was relatively higher fig 9 e g which is consistent with the previous observations subsequently an evolution route of the sludge granule in the start up process was proposed as shown in fig 10 the seed sludge was dominated by small granule clusters which gradually transformed into clusters dominated by anammox bacteria appearing as sludge granules of 1 0 mm in the later stage meanwhile these small clusters also aggregated into larger granule clusters through the bridging effect of eps he et al 2018 ma et al 2021 among them the medium sized granules 1 0 2 0 mm had a red outer layer during the early stage of evolution while the inner layer was still a dark color due to the limitation of mass transfer later in the evolution the inner part of the medium sized granules also gradually turned red however the inner part of the large sized granules 2 0 mm remained dark after the long term operation this may be due to the continuous accumulation of anammox bacteria in the surface layer of granules resulting in the continuous thickening of the surface layer thus making it increasingly difficult for the inner bacteria to utilize the substrate 4 conclusion in this study the transformation from a nitrification denitrification sludge to an anammox granule sludge was investigated for an enhanced anammox start up the main conclusions are as follows after 94 days of operation the anammox egsb process was successfully started up the nlr was increased to 8 0 gn l d after operating for more than 300 days and an excellent nrr and nre was obtained at 7 25 0 16 gn l d and 90 61 1 99 respectively during the start up process the appearance granule size and settling velocity of the sludge changed significantly the results show that the introduction of hap reaction in the anammox process can effectively improve the granule properties which is beneficial to the biomass retainment and stable operation of the reactor the evolution of anammox bacteria nitrifying bacteria denitrifying bacteria was elaborated in this study candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were the obtained anammox bacteria genera the abundance of which increased from 2 5 to 29 during the operation different successions occurred on candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were also observed the granule evolution route in the egsb reactor was revealed to be as that the enrichment of anammox biomass flourished from the bottom of reactor and the surface of the granules

15734,a lengthy start up period has been one of the key obstacles limiting the application of the anammox process in this investigation a nitrification denitrification sludge was used to start up the anammox egsb process the transformation process from nitrification denitrification sludge to anammox granule sludge was explored through the aspects of nitrogen removal performance granule properties microbial community structure and evolution route a successful start up of the anammox process was achieved after 94 days of reactor operation the highest nitrogen removal rate nrr obtained was 7 25 0 16 gn l d at a nitrogen loading rate nlr of 8 0 gn l d and the corresponding nitrogen removal efficiency was a high 90 61 1 99 the results of the microbial analysis revealed significant changes in anammox bacteria nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in the sludge notably the anammox bacteria abundance increased from 2 5 to 29 0 during the operation and candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia were the dominant genera distinct different successions on candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were also observed over the long term period in addition the settling performance anammox activity and biomass retention capacity of the granules were significantly enhanced during this process and the corresponding granule evolution route was also proposed the results in this study indicate the feasibility of using available seed sludge source for the fast transformation of anammox granules it is beneficial to the large scale application of anammox process and the utilization of excess sludge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox process start up microbial community evolution granule sludge egsb process data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction for decades the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process has been widely studied and adopted in the high efficiency nitrogen removal of municipal wastewater lotti et al 2015b reino et al 2018 wu et al 2021 various achievements have also been made for the treatment of centrates such as landfill leachate li et al 2018 and digestion liquid song et al 2022 as well as of industrial wastewater with a high ammonia concentration and low c n lackner et al 2014 the rapid developments in the anammox process can be attributed to the high level of research interest in the process due to its high nitrogen removal efficiency and energy saving compared with the conventional process specifically it represents a 100 saving of organic carbon and a 60 saving of aeration ma et al 2016 and nitrogen removal efficiency has been reported at 44 9 0 3 kgn m3 d in the lab scale zhang et al 2018 and 10 71 kgn m3 d in the full scale van der star et al 2007 however there are some challenges in the practical application that need to be addressed among them the lengthy start up period due to the low growth rate of anammox bacteria is a problem which urgently requires a solution adams et al 2022 guo et al 2022 in response to this problem different studies have focused on the reactor configuration the inoculated sludge and the additives to accelerate the start up of the anammox process in one study it was pointed out that the advantage of the membrane bioreactor mbr is that the anammox bacteria enrichment benefits from its high sludge retention property thus reducing the start up period tao et al 2012 however in full scale applications the operating cost of the mbr reactor is relatively high and the sequencing batch reactor sbr and up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor tend to be preferred as installations lackner et al 2014 while it has been shown in some studies that adding a small amount of anammox sludge to the seed sludge could speed up the start up miao et al 2020 wang et al 2020 this is not feasible when the anammox sludge source is not available besides that various additives such as hydrazine zekker et al 2021 ferrous iron bi et al 2014 and reduced graphene oxide yin et al 2016 have been used to accelerate the anammox start up but the cost of materials needs to be considered in practical applications and poor control of the dosage has been shown to have negative effects zhang et al 2018 currently large amounts of anammox seed sludge are not available in most countries kocamemi et al 2018 therefore it is of great significance to study the transformation from other types of sludge to anammox dominated sludge since there are many sludges that are more readily available than anammox sludge moreover the granulation of sludge has been reported to be a useful strategy to improve the settling performance and biomass retention capacity of the sludge manonmani and joseph 2018 tang et al 2017 which is conducive to retaining the anammox bacteria in the reactor and shortening the start up period in this study a nitrification denitrification sludge which was an excess sludge from the fluidized bed reactor conducting a high loading nitrogen removal process was used as the seed sludge to achieve the fast start up of anammox process the focus of this study is on the feasibility of the seed sludge source that can be obtained in large quantities for the fast formation of anammox granules which is beneficial to the large scale application of the anammox process and also a strategy for the utilization of excess sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and inoculum sludge the start up process was performed in an expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor with a working

to the apha standard methods yamaguchi et al 2016 after the pretreatment an icp oes analysis was conducted at wavelengths of 213 618 and 317 933 nm for phosphorus and calcium respectively 2 3 characterization of sludge granules the suspended solids ss and volatile suspended solids vss concentrations of the sludge were determined in every phases according to the apha methods apha awwa wef 2017 due to small size of the initial sludge the granule size was detected by a mastersizer 3000 particle size analyzer malvern panalytical ltd uk after the long term operation the granule size distribution was analyzed by a series of sieves with 0 25 0 5 1 0 2 0 2 8 mm apertures the settling velocity of the sludge was detected after sieving and by measuring the settling time 10 per size

different heights top middle and bottom part of the egsb reactor were also tested the test was performed using sealed vials with a reaction volume of 100 ml the reaction solution had the same composition as the influent of the egsb reactor except that the concentrations of tn and tp were fixed at 250 mg l and 25 mg l respectively the solution was aerated with nitrogen gas prior to the

germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term performance of the egsb reactor 3 1 1 nitrogen removal performance during the operation the egsb reactor was inoculated with 3 l of fluidized bed type nitrification denitrification sludge and started at an nlr of 1 0 gn l d table 1 and fig 1 illustrates the whole operating conditions and nitrogen removal performance in phase i the reactor showed very poor and fluctuating tn removal during the first 60 days the removal efficiency of nitrogen especially nh4 n was low and basically no no3 n left over in the effluent indicating that the denitrification was dominated at this time after 60 days when the nlr was decreased to 0 112 gn l d the tn removal efficiency gradually increased from 27 48 to 60 20 fig 1 c this indicates that the proportion of anammox bacteria in the seed sludge was extremely low thus a lower nlr was conducive to the start up in this situation in phase ii the nlr was increased from 0 18 to 2 5 gn l d within 80 days resulting in an nrr from 0 15 to 2 18 gn l d fig 1 b however when the nlr was raised to be higher than 1 0 gn l d an excessive ph of more than 9 0 occurred because the ph remained not controlled fig 1 a and the free ammonia fa increased rapidly to inhibit the anammox process fig 1 f as a result the inhibition caused a deterioration of the reactor performance in phase iii meanwhile some floating agglomerated sludge appeared in the upper part of the reactor fig s2 which was caused by the lack of inorganic components in the process of granule growth the agglomeration of sludge is also known to impede the settling performance of the granules and result in a lower transfer efficiency between the biomass and substrate adams et al 2022 xue et al 2020 therefore a ph control by dilute sulfuric acid and an addition of calcium and phosphorus were added after day 214 to avoid these adverse effects after that the nitrogen removal became stable and a high tn removal efficiency of around 90 was obtained fig 1 c in phase iv the nlr increased rapidly from 3 0 to 8 0 gn l d within 100 days fig 1 b the highest nrr reached 7 25 0 16 gn l d at an nlr of 8 0 gn l d with a tn removal efficiency of 90 61 1 99 fig 1 c the rapid increase in the nrr was inseparable from the formation and growth of anammox granules the granulation process is an important means to enhance the anammox biomass retention in virtue of the aggregation tendency of anammox microorganisms wang et al 2020 and an efficient biomass retainment is a key prerequisite for improving the nitrogen removal performance it has been reported that the inorganic precipitation promoted the anammox biomass enrichment not only as a carrier for the biomass attachment to promote the granulation but also as a promoter to improve the settling performance of the sludge fernández et al 2008 xue et al 2021 in this study it was achieved by introducing calcium and phosphorus precipitation to generate hydroxyapatite hap the removal performance of phosphorus is illustrated in fig s3 and table s1 in phase iii the phosphorus and calcium concentrations were 25 0 mg l and 53 9 mg l respectively and the corresponding ca p ratio was consistent with the reaction formula eq 3 of hap in phase iv the phosphorus concentration increased with the nlr ranging from 25 0 to 60 0 mg l as a result the tp removal efficiency increased from 41 55 11 42 to 71 03 3 38 the effect of calcium and phosphorus addition on the characteristics of sludge granules will be further discussed in the next section 3 ca2 po4 3 oh ca10 po4 6 oh 2 3 1 2 stoichiometric ratio variation fig 2 illustrates the rs and rp variation during the operation which represents the ratio of consumed no2 n to consumed no2 n and the ratio of produced no3 n to consumed nh4 n respectively according to the anammox reaction formula eq 4 proposed by strous m strous et al 1998 the empirical rs and rp values were 1 32 and 0 26 respectively in this study in phase i the ratios of rs and rp obtained were 1 90 0 91 and 0 16 0 24 respectively which were discrete and largely deviated from the values in the anammox reaction however from phase ii the concentrative degrees of these ratios became increasingly higher until they were in the vicinity of the empirical value and then finally stabilized at 1 26 0 06 and 0 21 0 04 respectively similar phenomena have also been reported in other studies qin et al 2017 wang et al 2021 t wang et al 2020 in which a stable ratio close to the empirical value was also considered to be a sign of the successful start up of anammox overall the successful start up of anammox process was achieved after 94 days of operation and the egsb reactor system was capable of a high nlr of 8 0 gn l d after 300 days 4 1 0 nh4 1 32 no2 0 066 hco3 0 13 h 1 02 n2 0 26 no3 0 066 ch2o0 5n0 15 2 03 h2o 3 1 3 comparison with similar studies on anammox process start up table 2 summarizes the research on the start up of anammox process without mixed with anammox sludge various kinds of seed sludge have been used in the anammox start up process including activated sludge anaerobic digestion sludge denitrifying sludge and their combinations also many studies have employed the strategy of adding accelerators to speed up the anammox process such as reduced graphene oxide rgo yin et al 2016 fes zou et al 2020 and fe3 addition wang et al 2021 notably sludge entrapment by poly vinyl alcohol gel beads demonstrated excellent performance in immobilizing and enriching anammox biomass bae et al 2015 cho et al 2018 while the addition of accelerators has been shown to promote the start up of anammox it would be a cost burden in practical applications note that the temperature for the start up process was generally between 32 and 35 c which is because this is the optimum temperature range for the growth of anammox bacteria sobotka et al 2021 the type of reactor used was mainly uasb type reactor which is due to the excellent stability of uasb reactor towards the substrate shock jin et al 2008 among these similar studies table 2 the difference of this study is that the enhanced start up of the anammox process was achieved by the rapid formation of anammox granules moreover this study focused on the transformation characteristics of microorganisms and the evolution route of sludge granules which will be further discussed in the subsequent sections in terms of nitrogen removal performance and start up speed this study also achieved a relatively high nrr and start up efficiency in the same type of research 3 2 physical characteristic of the sludge in the egsb reactor 3 2 1 morphological characteristic of the sludge granules in this study the egsb reactor has been operated for 366 days fig 3 a illustrates the appearance of the sludge during the operation which was dark brown in phase i after operating for 300 days in phase iv it was obvious that the sludge began to turn red and the granules increased in size anammox bacteria are typically red in color it has been shown that this color is derived from cytochrome c and the chroma has been confirmed to be significantly correlated with the quantity of anammox bacteria and specific anammox activity kang et al 2020 kartal and keltjens 2016 therefore the degree of redness of the sludge can be used to roughly estimate the abundance of anammox bacteria and a higher red chroma indicates enhanced anammox activity in the sludge as shown in fig 3 b the pattern of the sludge granules varied according to the reactor heights and different sizes in phase iv the degree of redness of the sludge deepened from top to bottom in reactor height and from small granules to large granules moreover a cross section of a small red granule was uniformly red while a larger red granule was red on the outside but dark inside these phenomena explain that the enrichment of anammox bacteria spread from the bottom to the top in the reactor and was initially enriched in the surface layer of the granules this is related to the reactor type and operating conditions the up flow type egsb reactor was conducive for the sludge at the bottom to receive more nutrients and the dilution effect of the recirculation on the high concentration substrate prevented the inhibition on anammox bacteria thereby facilitating growth and enrichment lin et al 2019 3 2 2 variation of the sludge concentration fig 4 shows the variation on the total amounts and concentrations of ss vss and inorganics during the operation in phase i the total amount and concentration of the sludge both decreased significantly at the beginning indicating that a large number of heterotrophic and aerobic bacteria died due to the anaerobic and organic deficient environment in phase ii with a low nlr both the amount and concentration of the sludge remained relatively stable however after starting the addition of phosphorus and calcium in phase iii both the total ss and its concentration increased rapidly the hap precipitation increased the proportion of inorganic matter in the sludge granule and although the vss ss ratio decreased it did not affect the biomass concentration of the granule fig 4 b it can be seen that in the late phase iv the total biomass had increased obviously due to the high nrr 3 2 3 granule size distribution and settling velocity in the original sludge the main granule size distribution was from 0 3 to 1 0 mm fig 5 a however after running for 355 days fig 5 b the granule size was dominated by sizes of 1 0 to 2 0 mm the growth in granule size reflected the effective enrichment of biomass on the one hand and played a positive role in the sludge settling on the other hand when the sludge in the reactor is approximated as a sphere the effect of granule size and other factors on the settling performance of sludge can be concluded by the corrected stokes formula eq 5 xu et al 2021a 5 v 4 g ρ s ρ d 3 ρ μ where v is the settling velocity of the granule in fluid cm s g is the gravitational constant cm s2 ρs is the granule density g cm3 ρ is the density of the fluid g cm3 d is the diameter of the granule cm and μ is the empirical drag coefficient it can be seen that both the growth in granule size d and the increase in granule density ρs contribute to the improvement of settling performance which is also consistent with the results obtained in this study fig 5 c among them the settling velocity of sludge was proportional to the granule size and it was higher in the regions where the hap precipitation reaction had preferentially occurred lower part of the reactor more importantly compared with day 1 the average settling velocity of the sludge improved greatly from 31 89 m h to 111 90 m h after day 355 with the inorganics increased from 49 39 g l to 135 26 g l on average compared with other similar studies liang et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 the sludge granules in this study also showed excellent settleability indicating a high biomass retention capacity of the reactor 3 3 variation and distribution of the microbial community in the egsb reactor the microbial community structures of the sludge during the long term operation and from different heights of the reactor as well as with different granule sizes are illustrated in fig 6 at the phylum level fig 6 a there were four main bacterial phyla in the sludge planctomycetes proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes among them proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes which are classified as heterotrophic bacteria have been reported to exist in the anammox systems and live on the extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp produced by biomass decay and metabolism akaboci et al 2018 chen et al 2021 during the long term operation planctomycetes the phylum which the anammox bacteria belong to had a significant increase in the abundance from 21 6 to 44 1 which has also been observed in other reports on the anammox start up niederdorfer et al 2021 wang et al 2021 however nitrospirae the phylum to which nitrifying bacteria belong tang et al 2018 significantly decreased in abundance during the operation this is because the anaerobic condition of the reactor made it difficult for nitrifying bacteria to survive at the genus level fig 6 b it can be seen that candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were the obtained anammox bacteria in the sludge oshiki et al 2016 zhang and okabe 2020 during the long term operation candidatus brocadia was the only anammox bacteria in the beginning after the reactor running for more than 300 days candidatus kuenenia came from behind and surpassed candidatus brocadia in abundance it has been reported that candidatus kuenenia is an affinity k strategist and is dominant at a low substrate concentration while candidatus brocadia conducts a growth rate r strategy and is dominant at a high substrate concentration ali and okabe 2015 van der star et al 2008 in this study the growth of candidatus kuenenia was encouraged due to the low influent concentration early in the reactor operation in addition although the influent tn was increased to more than 1000 mg l after 300 days the high recirculation ratio 11 55 ensured that the actual influent tn concentration was not higher than 250 mg l which provided favorable conditions for the survival of candidatus kuenenia after the long term operation the abundance of anammox bacteria increased greatly from 2 5 to 29 0 indicating the continuous enrichment of anammox bacteria and the successful start up of anammox process in addition due to the anaerobic environment the abundance of nitritation bacteria nitrosomonas and candidatus nitrosymbiomonas and nitrification bacteria nitrospira showed a downward trend with the duration arora et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 this also explains the decrease in biomass at the beginning of the operation fig 4 apparently also partly due to the massive death of aerobic bacteria on the contrary denitratisoma rhodoplanes and afipia which are affiliated to denitrifying bacteria increased with the duration from 2 5 to 13 2 the denitrifying bacteria was able to live on the nitrate in the reactor fahrbach et al 2006 wang et al 2019 and the increasing abundance may have resulted from the increasing nlr of the reactor which allowed more nitrate to be produced from the anammox reaction moreover the eps secreted by denitrifying bacteria was declared to have enhanced the anammox bacteria activity guo et al 2016 illustrating the friendly coexistence between denitrifying bacteria and anammox bacteria there was no obvious difference in the community structure of the sludge from different heights and different granule sizes at the phylum level fig 6 a however at the genus level fig 6 b the abundance of anammox bacteria at the bottom of the reactor 30 7 was higher than that at the top 27 4 the main reason is that the bottom sludge contained a higher percentage of candidatus brocadia 15 2 compared with the top sludge 11 5 which further confirmed that candidatus brocadia is more adaptable to the environment with high substrate concentration bottom of the egsb reactor than candidatus kuenenia for granules of different sizes 1 0 1 0 2 0 and 2 0 mm the abundance of anammox bacteria was basically the same however it is reported that under a low strength wastewater 58 mgn l the anammox bacteria abundance increased when the granule size was below 0 9 mm while it slightly declined with the further increase of granule size zhu et al 2018 the tn concentration in this study was much higher and finally reached 1334 mg l at an nlr of 8 0 gn l d this indicates that the abundance distribution with sizes may be different between high and low strength wastewater which deserves further exploration moreover the proportion of candidatus brocadia in the small granules 1 0 mm was much higher 15 2 compared to 10 6 and 9 7 in the medium granules 1 0 2 0 mm and large granules 2 0 mm respectively this may be attributed to the larger surface area of the small granules enabling them to receive a higher substrate loading which was more conducive to the growth of candidatus brocadia conducting an r strategy 3 4 variation in the anammox activity 3 4 1 anammox activity saa under different nlr the saa of the sludge was tested under the nlrs of 0 5 1 14 1 7 3 0 5 0 and 8 0 gn l d to reveal the improving trajectory of the anammox activity fig 7 when the nlr was lower than 3 0 g l d there was a strongly positive correlation between the anammox activity and the nlr r2 0 9992 with the saa value increased rapidly from 0 00079 to 0 304 gn gvss d a similar correlation was also found between the anammox bacteria abundance and the nlr fig 6 b suggesting that the increased anammox bacteria abundance during this period resulted in the enhanced anammox activity in other single stage and two stage anammox processes an increase in the anammox activity with the abundance of anammox bacteria was also found li et al 2021 miao et al 2020 wang et al 2021 according to lin lin et al 2019 with the increase in the nlr the activity of hydrazine oxidase hzo which uniquely presents in the anammox bacteria was significantly enhanced and the content of the co enzyme heme c also increased when the nlr was higher than 3 0 g l d the saa value stabilized at about 0 3 gn gvss d this may be due to the almost negligible change in the abundance of anammox bacteria after the nlr was 3 0 g l d day 275 allowing the anammox activity to remain at a stable level moreover there is another discovery when combining with the results of the biomass variation fig 4 and the anammox bacteria abundance fig 6 b in the reactor it can be concluded that before the nlr was 3 0 gn l d the capable operating strength of the reactor mainly depended on the anammox bacteria abundance per unit while after the nlr was 3 0 gn l d the capable operating strength mainly relied on the proliferation of the anammox biomass 3 4 2 anammox activity of sludge with different sizes and heights sludge granules from different heights of the reactor top middle and bottom were sieved into three groups 1 0 mm 1 0 2 0 mm and 2 0 mm respectively to conduct the activity tests and the results showed strongly differences in the saa value fig 8 the sludge with granules of larger sizes obviously obtained a higher anammox activity which is consistent with another report chen et al 2016 a study has shown that in the range of 0 2 4 0 mm a larger granule size is associated with a more dense distribution of anammox bacteria on the surface layer xu et al 2021a this may well be the reason for the stronger anammox activity however it has also been pointed out that larger granules tend to be associated with lower mass transfer efficiencies between the substrate and the anammox bacteria in the subsurface layer shi et al 2017 another study by xu xu et al 2021b showed that in the size range between 0 59 and 3 44 mm the anammox activity first increased and then decreased with the granule of 2 17 mm having the highest anammox activity in this study since the granule size of the sludge was mainly distributed between 1 0 and 2 0 mm fig 5 a it is likely that the high anammox activity of the granules in this size range was the reason for the efficient operation of egsb reactor besides that the saa values of the top and middle part were higher than that of bottom part this result is contrary to the conclusion made by ma ma et al 2017 that the sludge showed the highest value at the bottom part and the lowest at the top part of reactor a study by zhang zhang et al 2016b pointed out that the anammox activity decreased under a high substrate condition and also resulted in a longer lag phase since the biomass required more time to adapt to the high strength environment the influent tn reported by ma ma et al 2017 was in the range of 300 700 mg l which was much lower than the tn concentration 1334 mg l in phase iv of this study as a result the substrate shock received by the bottom sludge was much higher in this study resulting in a lower saa value of the sludge 3 5 granule evolution route in the egsb reactor based on the above mentioned results it is concluded that the apparent redness fig 3 the abundance of anammox bacteria fig 6 and the anammox activity fig 7 of the sludge were all demonstrated an outstanding improvement during the long term operation microscopic and fish observations of the mature sludge granules were performed in phase iv and the images of a typical sludge granule are shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the surface layer of the sludge was redder in color while the inner layer was characterized by darker sludge fig 9 a cryosections of the sludge were subjected to fish analysis to obtain the distribution of different bacteria fig 9 b g a probe named amx820 red specific for ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis and ca brocadia anammoxidans and a mixture of eub338 i iv and eub338 ii iii probes green to detect all bacteria were used in the analysis the outer layer of the sludge was rich in anammox bacteria fig 9 b d and the red brightness of the surface layer was higher which also indicates a stronger anammox activity ma et al 2020 in contrast the abundance of anammox bacteria in the inner part was lower and the abundance of non anammox bacteria was relatively higher fig 9 e g which is consistent with the previous observations subsequently an evolution route of the sludge granule in the start up process was proposed as shown in fig 10 the seed sludge was dominated by small granule clusters which gradually transformed into clusters dominated by anammox bacteria appearing as sludge granules of 1 0 mm in the later stage meanwhile these small clusters also aggregated into larger granule clusters through the bridging effect of eps he et al 2018 ma et al 2021 among them the medium sized granules 1 0 2 0 mm had a red outer layer during the early stage of evolution while the inner layer was still a dark color due to the limitation of mass transfer later in the evolution the inner part of the medium sized granules also gradually turned red however the inner part of the large sized granules 2 0 mm remained dark after the long term operation this may be due to the continuous accumulation of anammox bacteria in the surface layer of granules resulting in the continuous thickening of the surface layer thus making it increasingly difficult for the inner bacteria to utilize the substrate 4 conclusion in this study the transformation from a nitrification denitrification sludge to an anammox granule sludge was investigated for an enhanced anammox start up the main conclusions are as follows after 94 days of operation the anammox egsb process was successfully started up the nlr was increased to 8 0 gn l d after operating for more than 300 days and an excellent nrr and nre was obtained at 7 25 0 16 gn l d and 90 61 1 99 respectively during the start up process the appearance granule size and settling velocity of the sludge changed significantly the results show that the introduction of hap reaction in the anammox process can effectively improve the granule properties which is beneficial to the biomass retainment and stable operation of the reactor the evolution of anammox bacteria nitrifying bacteria denitrifying bacteria was elaborated in this study candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were the obtained anammox bacteria genera the abundance of which increased from 2 5 to 29 during the operation different successions occurred on candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were also observed the granule evolution route in the egsb reactor was revealed to be as that the enrichment of anammox biomass flourished from the bottom of reactor and the surface of the granules
