human health are used intensively in industrial processes and products in recent years 1 due to the lack of awareness during production use and disposal these have reached dangerous levels for the

accumulate in living tissues and cause hazardous effects to human health 2 3 among all these heavy metals pb and cu are prevalent metal pollutants in the natural environment and the most toxic pollutants in natural water environments due to industrial manufacturing including petroleum refining metal smelting electroplating battery production mining printing and so on therefore the removal of these metals from aqueous environments is one of the most important issues 4 recently scientists and environmentalists have attempted to find more effective feasible cheap and environmental techniques for removal of heavy metal contaminants from aqueous solutions many methods are used to remove these impurities the most common methods used for waste removal include adsorption biosorption coagulation filtration reverse osmosis and ion exchange processes 5 10 among these treatments adsorption has advantages such as high selectivity efficiency flexibility in design and non hazardous technology therefore this process is an important technique for the removal of heavy metals 11 14 for pb ii and cu ii ion removal from aqueous environments many studies were carried out with various adsorbents 15 17 in recent years adsorbent clays received much attention for adsorption of inorganic and organic contaminants from wastewater use of these materials is interesting due to their abundant availability low cost non toxicity and potential for ion exchange 18 20 besides all these advantages aluminol and silanol are groups on clay minerals which allow the surface to be functionalized with different chemicals to elevate the affinity for pollutants such as heavy metals 21 22 bentonite is a montmorillonite crystal clay formed by overlapping of crystal units 2 1 consisting of a gibbsite layer surrounded by two layers of silica on the top and bottom the negative charge excess due to isomorphic displacement is compensated by the exchangeable cations between the layers clays of this type have high capacity to remove cationic impurities 23 traditionally it is difficult to observe the simultaneous effect of parameters that affect a response which requires extra experiments with the traditional methods one parameter is changed while others are kept at a constant level response surface methodology rsm is a method in which statistical and mathematical techniques are used to compare theoretical and experimental data by optimizing dependent variable values with various independent variables 6 24 25 rsm a multivariate optimization technique enables the efficient determination of optimum operating conditions and evaluates the effect of the interaction in a multivariate system by using statistical methods compared to altering one factor variable at a time 26 27 accordingly rsm can easily overcome situations requiring a large number of tests consuming extra time and chemicals and of course involving extra costs 28 29 in this current study we examined the removal efficiency of pb ii and cu ii ions from aqueous environments using bentonite enriched with sh groups bsh through the rsm approach for the first time for this purpose low cost and naturally abundant bentonite was chemically modified with sh functional groups to increase adsorption affinity to these metal ions compared to non modified bentonite minerals there is no information available in the literature regarding the removal of both metals using bsh the great advantage of this study is that bsh showed fast adsorption performance compared to non modified clays such as bentonite zeolite and kaolin the combined effects of initial ph initial concentration co adsorbent dose m and contact time t on pb ii and cu ii removal from aqueous environments with bsh were investigated using central composite design ccd under rsm with design expert 7 0 the fit of the model and the importance of the variables were evaluated by analysis of variance anova in addition the

and tga analyses in our previous studies 31 32 2 2 heavy metal adsorption experiments the batch technique was used to investigate the adsorption of pb ii and cu ii on bsh all experiments were performed in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks including 100 ml of metal solutions on a temperature controlled magnetic stirrer water bath samples taken after adsorption were filtered with whatman filter paper

optimization of experimental studies were performed using ccd under rsm firstly for pb ii and cu ii adsorption some pretests were performed and the range and central points of all independent factors were determined the ranges of parameters were initial ph 2 6 a co 10 100 mg l b m 1 250 mg c and t 10 180 min d the number of experiments required for a total of four parameters was determined to be

both metal ions β0 βi βii and βij are the constant linear quadratic and interaction coefficients respectively xi i 1 4 are the independent parameters affecting the response 3 results and discussion 3 1 ccd based experimental studies the effects of independent parameters such as initial ph co pb 2 and cu 2 m and t on the adsorption performance were investigated and optimized in a single system 3 28 the optimization of these parameters was performed by using rsm based ccd the reason for the application of ccd was to more easily evaluate the interaction among parameters affecting the response and determine the optimum values of the parameters for each metal ion 30 batch experiments were run and values of percentage removal for each run are given in table 2 the quadratic model equations describing the relationship between the response and the parameters affecting it as a result of the experiments proposed by ccd are given below 4 p b i i a d s o r p t i o n 1 32091 25 99319 p h 0

necessary to apply the analysis of variance anova to determine whether the quadratic model is significant or not 34 the determined coefficient values achieved for pb ii and cu ii removal responses indicate that approximately 90 of the variability in the responses were explained by the models table 3 also as shown in table 3 the models obtained for both responses were statistically significant due to the low p value 0 0003 and 0 0001 for pb ii and cu ii removal respectively the coefficients of determination r2 for the models were 0 88 and 0 90 for pb ii and cu ii adsorption percentage respectively these values indicate a good fit between the values predicted by the model and actual experimentally observed values fig 1 namely these results showed that the model equations are substantially credible and reliable it can be seen that they are in good agreement in fig 1a and b which is significant for verification of the model 3 2 effect of independent parameters on pb ii and cu ii removal three dimensional 3d graphs showing the simultaneous effects of the independent parameters obtained from ccd experiments are given in fig 2 in fig 2a and c the increased co of metal ions appeared to increase the adsorption efficiency to a certain extent 32 when co of pb ii and cu ii were approximately 35 and 40 mg l respectively adsorption was found to reach equilibrium at higher levels it can be said that because surface centers are saturated with metal ions adsorption is not changed and adsorption performance decreased the increased concentration of metal ions increases adsorption due to the increasing driving forces of metal ions towards the active sites on the adsorbent 35 as a result of experimental studies the removal of both metal ions reached equilibrium in the range of 30 40 mg l with increasing co values the existing active sites on the adsorbent become inadequate to adsorb the metal ions and the pb ii and cu ii ions remain un adsorbed in the solution the initial ph of heavy metal solutions is one of the most important parameters affecting the adsorption efficiency in aqueous solutions as seen in fig 2a pb ii adsorption efficiency increased rapidly when the initial ph increased from 2 to 5 and it was observed that the maximal adsorption capacity was reached at about ph 5 similarly cu ii adsorption efficiency increased with increasing ph values and maximum removal was achieved at approximately ph 4 5 fig 2c when the initial ph value is higher than 5 5 a reduction in the removal of both metal ions are clearly seen the relationship between metal adsorption and initial ph can be correlated with functional groups on the surface of the adsorbent as well as the metal chemistry of the solution when the initial ph of the solutions is increased the negative charges on the adsorbent surface are enriched due to the deprotonation of the active groups therefore more electrostatic attraction forces occur between the positively charged cu ii and pb ii ions and the negatively charged surface of the bsh this increases the adsorption as can be seen in fig 2a and c the adsorption performances reached equilibrium at about initial ph 5 and 4 5 for pb ii and cu ii respectively at low ph values owing to the excessive amount of h3o ions in pb ii and cu ii solutions the adsorption efficiency of the metals will be low due to the competition for sites on the surface of bsh 36 37 the rise in the removal of ions due to the increase in the amount of adsorbent can be explained by the increase in the number of active sites fig 2b and d indicate the effect of bsh dosage on the adsorption performances of both metals increasing the adsorbent dose in the solution will increase the distribution coefficient and amount of active sites for metal adsorption so metal ion removal will increase 1 as a result of experiments it was observed that the optimum adsorbent doses for pb ii and cu ii removal were approximately 140 mg and 150 mg respectively adsorption equilibrium developed at about 150 min for removal of both metal ions fig 2b d when the adsorption performances obtained against mixing periods are taken into consideration the metal ion uptake is higher in the first minutes initially the adsorption rate is higher than the desorption rate however with the increasing mixing time the rate of adsorption and desorption are equalized thus the adsorption balance was established 38 in addition it is seen in the mathematical model and 3 d graphs that the adsorption is maximum in the 140 150 min range for both metal ions 3 3 optimization process for adsorption of heavy metal ions numerical optimization is based on selection of the desired target for each factor to obtain maximum response process costs are very important for optimization for optimization of each parameter hundreds of trials were required using traditional methods however with rsm optimization only thirty experiments were sufficient for each metal studied in the optimization procedure the ultimate goal is to obtain a process where the cost is low and the result is maximum 1 3 the utilization of rsm in combination with experimental design was performed to obtain the effect of independent parameters and define the optimal conditions 26 27 in this study the numeric optimization program in ccd was used to detect the optimum values the level of each parameter was selected as in range at these levels the solutions with maximum response were investigated a solution resulting in maximum response was found optimum values of the parameters studied for cu ii and pb ii adsorption and the maximum adsorption efficiency are given in table 4 these data are the optimization results in the desired conditions and were verified by experiments performed under these optimum conditions comparing the adsorption efficiency of bsh with previous adsorbents used in the related literature for this purpose is important in terms of revealing the importance of our adsorbent table 5 table 5 shows that bsh used in this study is a suitable and usable adsorbent for the adsorption of pb ii and cu ii from aqueous media in addition great advantages include the easy transport process the abundance of bentonite in nature and the lack of danger to the environment due to waste left after the adsorption process 3 4 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics give information about the adsorption mechanism which is important for process efficiency kinetic studies define the rate of adsorption this speed controls the change in metal adsorption over time at the solid liquid interface pseudo first order 42 pseudo second order 43 weber morris intraparticle diffusion 44 and liquid film diffusion 45 models were used to evaluate the kinetic parameters of the adsorption process the linearized forms of these models are as follows respectively 6 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 7 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 8 q t k i d t 0 5 c 9 ln 1 q t q e r i t where qt is the adsorbed amount at time t qe is the adsorbed amount at equilibrium mg g 1 kid is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 0 5 k1 and k2 are the rate constant for pseudo first and second order min 1 g mg 1 min 1 respectively c is the thickness of the boundary layer and ri min 1 is liquid film diffusion constant the data obtained from the kinetic studies for both metal ions are given in fig 3 and table 6 according to this data the adsorption kinetics for both metals were observed to correspond to the pseudo second order kinetic model according to the higher r2 values at the same time when the values in table 6 are examined the qe value calculated from the pseudo second order kinetic model is in good agreement with the experimentally available qexp value in addition it can be concluded from the information obtained for the weber morris intraparticle and liquid film diffusion models that the adsorption process is controlled by both film and intraparticle diffusion because the intra particle diffusion model graph does not pass through the origin 6 46 48 finally we can say that the adsorption mechanism of pb ii and cu ii occurs gradually in layers and is a combination of both diffusion models pb ii and cu ii ions are soft ions due to possessing the characteristic features of soft acids such as relatively large ionic size low electronegativity and high polarizability they therefore have strong interactions with soft lewis base sulfur atoms in the mercapto group sh the proposed mechanism for pb ii and cu ii adsorption by bsh is illustrated in fig 4 both heavy metals might form stable hydrogen bond interactions with the mercapto group of bsh and these interactions cause efficient removal of pb ii and cu ii 3 5 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms define metal adsorption as a function of metal concentration at constant temperature and equilibrium also they explain the relationship between the amount of adsorbed and the equilibrium concentration or equilibrium pressure equilibrium data observed in our study were applied to the langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm equations the langmuir isotherm is based on considering monolayer adsorption on a homogeneous surface 39 the linear form of this model is given in eq 10 10 1 q e 1 q max k l c e 1 q max where ce mg l and qe mg g are metal ion concentration and adsorbed metal ion amount at equilibrium respectively kl is langmuir equilibrium constant l mg and qmax is the monolayer maximum adsorption capacity mg g the freundlich isotherm describes adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces and does not accept a single layer capacity due to the increase in the amount of adsorbed substance in the solution 49 the linearized form of model is as follows 11 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e kf l g and n are freundlich constants are associated with adsorption capacity and heterogeneity factor respectively the d r isotherm model was developed to clarify the effect of the porous structure of the adsorbent and the linear form of the model is given in eq 12 12 ln q e ln q m β ε 2 where qm is the monolayer adsorption capacity mg g β is a coefficient related to the energy of adsorption mol2 j2 and ε symbolizes the polanyi potential and can be calculated with eq 13 13 ε rtln 1 1 c e the β constant assists in calculating the adsorption energy e it provides information about the physical or chemical character of the adsorption the e value can be calculated with the following equation 14 e 1 2β based on the e values given in table 7 it can be said that the adsorption processes for both metals are physical 50 when fig 5 and table 7 are examined the freundlich equations for both pb ii and cu ii adsorption are more compatible than others because of the high r2 value 3 6 adsorption in binary metal systems in order to observe the competitive effects of pb ii and cu ii ions the removal of these ions by bsh was examined in the binary metal system the change in pb ii adsorption efficiency in the presence of cu ii ions was investigated by changing the cu ii ion concentration in the range from 0 to 40 mg l under constant optimum conditions obtained from ccd in a single system for pb ii and vice versa for cu ii the removal yields of cu ii and pb ii in the single metal system were 88 19 and 95 05 respectively in the case of binary adsorption studies with increasing amounts of competitive ions while pb ii removal decreased slightly cu ii removal decreased rapidly this shows that pb ii ions were preferably adsorbed on the surface of the bsh compared to cu ii ions considering fig 6 the adsorption performances in the binary metal systems were less than in single metal systems because of competition among the metal ions to reach the active sites on the adsorbent also as shown in fig 6 the results from the binary metal system were similar to those obtained from a single metal system pb ii cu ii it can be concluded that these results are related to the differences in metal characteristics and the resultant affinity for adsorption sites 51 52 in addition we can say that our adsorbent has important potential for effective removal of both metals especially in waste water containing pb ii and cu ii 4 conclusion the adsorption efficiency for heavy metal ions pb ii and cu ii on bsh from an aqueous solution was investigated using the batch adsorption method ccd was utilized to optimize the parameters affecting the adsorption efficiency in a single system as a result of numerical optimization the optimum conditions for initial ph co m and t in pb ii adsorption were 5 1 32 98 mg l 142 13 mg and 146 min and the optimum conditions in cu ii adsorption were 4 52 37 9 mg l 152 3 mg and 146 12 min respectively removal yield for pb ii and cu ii in these optimum conditions were determined as 95 08 and 88 19 respectively the obtained data were applied to the kinetic equations and found to comply with the pseudo second order model for both metals in addition it was found that both surface film and intraparticle diffusion contribute to the speed limiting step considering the information obtained from the weber morris intra particular diffusion model the isotherm studies showed that pb ii and cu ii adsorption equilibrium data were better suited to the freundlich isotherm model in a single metal system bsh exhibited much higher removal yields for pb ii compared to cu ii a similar situation was observed in the binary system it can be said that the affinity for pb ii to bsh is higher than that of cu ii finally bsh has important potential for effective removal of both metals especially in waste water containing both pb ii and cu ii acknowledgements i would like to thank ümit ecer and şakir yılmaz for their help with laboratory studies

levels it can be said that because surface centers are saturated with metal ions adsorption is not changed and adsorption performance decreased the increased concentration of metal ions increases adsorption due to the increasing driving forces of metal ions towards the active sites on the adsorbent 35 as a result of experimental studies the removal of both metal ions reached equilibrium in the range of 30 40 mg l with increasing co values the existing active sites on the adsorbent become inadequate to adsorb the metal ions and the pb ii and cu ii ions remain un adsorbed in the solution the initial ph of heavy metal solutions is one of the most important parameters affecting the adsorption efficiency in aqueous solutions as seen in fig 2a pb ii adsorption efficiency increased rapidly when the initial ph increased from 2 to 5 and it was observed that the maximal adsorption capacity was reached at about ph 5 similarly cu ii adsorption efficiency increased with increasing ph values and maximum removal was achieved at approximately ph 4 5 fig 2c when the initial ph value is higher than 5 5 a reduction in the removal of both metal ions are clearly seen the relationship between metal adsorption and initial ph can be correlated with functional groups on the surface of the adsorbent as well as the metal chemistry of the solution when the initial ph of the solutions is increased the negative charges on the adsorbent surface are enriched due to the deprotonation of the active groups therefore more electrostatic attraction forces occur between the positively charged cu ii and pb ii ions and the negatively charged surface of the bsh this increases the adsorption as can be seen in fig 2a and c the adsorption performances reached equilibrium at about initial ph 5 and 4 5 for pb ii and cu ii respectively at low ph values owing to the excessive amount of h3o ions in pb ii and cu ii solutions the adsorption efficiency of the metals will be low due to the competition for sites on the surface of bsh 36 37 the rise in the removal of ions due to the increase in the amount of adsorbent can be explained by the increase in the number of active sites fig 2b and d indicate the effect of bsh dosage on the adsorption performances of both metals increasing the adsorbent dose in the solution will increase the distribution coefficient and amount of active sites for metal adsorption so metal ion removal will increase 1 as a result of experiments it was observed that the optimum adsorbent doses for pb ii and cu ii removal were approximately 140 mg and 150 mg respectively adsorption equilibrium developed at about 150 min for removal of both metal ions fig 2b d when the adsorption performances obtained against mixing periods are taken into consideration the metal ion uptake is higher in the first minutes initially the adsorption rate is higher than the desorption rate however with the increasing mixing time the rate of adsorption and desorption are equalized thus the adsorption balance was established 38 in addition it is seen in the mathematical model and 3 d graphs that the adsorption is maximum in the 140 150 min range for both metal ions 3 3 optimization process for adsorption of heavy metal ions numerical optimization is based on selection of the desired target for each factor to obtain maximum response process costs are very important for optimization for optimization of each parameter hundreds of trials were required using traditional methods however with rsm optimization only thirty experiments were sufficient for each metal studied in the optimization procedure the ultimate goal is to obtain a process where the cost is low and the result is maximum 1 3 the utilization of rsm in combination with experimental design was performed to obtain the effect of independent parameters and define the optimal conditions 26 27 in this study the numeric optimization program in ccd was used to detect the optimum values the level of each parameter was selected as in range at these levels the solutions with maximum response were investigated a solution resulting in maximum response was found optimum values of the parameters studied for cu ii and pb ii adsorption and the maximum adsorption efficiency are given in table 4 these data are the optimization results in the desired conditions and were verified by experiments performed under these optimum conditions comparing the adsorption efficiency of bsh with previous adsorbents used in the related literature for this purpose is important in terms of revealing the importance of our adsorbent table 5 table 5 shows that bsh used in this study is a suitable and usable adsorbent for the adsorption of pb ii and cu ii from aqueous media in addition great advantages include the easy transport process the abundance of bentonite in nature and the lack of danger to the environment due to waste left after the adsorption process 3 4 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics give information about the adsorption mechanism which is important for process efficiency kinetic studies define the rate of adsorption this speed controls the change in metal adsorption over time at the solid liquid interface pseudo first order 42 pseudo second order 43 weber morris intraparticle diffusion 44 and liquid film diffusion 45 models were used to evaluate the kinetic parameters of the adsorption process the linearized forms of these models are as follows respectively 6 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 7 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 8 q t k i d t 0 5 c 9 ln 1 q t q e r i t where qt is the adsorbed amount at time t qe is the adsorbed amount at equilibrium mg g 1 kid is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 0 5 k1 and k2 are the rate constant for pseudo first and second order min 1 g mg 1 min 1 respectively c is the thickness of the boundary layer and ri min 1 is liquid film diffusion constant the data obtained from the kinetic studies for both metal ions are given in fig 3 and table 6 according to this data the adsorption kinetics for both metals were observed to correspond to the pseudo second order kinetic model according to the higher r2 values at the same time when the values in table 6 are examined the qe value calculated from the pseudo second order kinetic model is in good agreement with the experimentally available qexp value in addition it can be concluded from the information obtained for the weber morris intraparticle and liquid film diffusion models that the adsorption process is controlled by both film and intraparticle diffusion because the intra particle diffusion model graph does not pass through the origin 6 46 48 finally we can say that the adsorption mechanism of pb ii and cu ii occurs gradually in layers and is a combination of both diffusion models pb ii and cu ii ions are soft ions due to possessing the characteristic features of soft acids such as relatively large ionic size low electronegativity and high polarizability they therefore have strong interactions with soft lewis base sulfur atoms in the mercapto group sh the proposed mechanism for pb ii and cu ii adsorption by bsh is illustrated in fig 4 both heavy metals might form stable hydrogen bond interactions with the mercapto group of bsh and these interactions cause efficient removal of pb ii and cu ii 3 5 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms define metal adsorption as a function of metal concentration at constant temperature and equilibrium also they explain the relationship between the amount of adsorbed and the equilibrium concentration or equilibrium pressure equilibrium data observed in our study were applied to the langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm equations the langmuir isotherm is based on considering monolayer adsorption on a homogeneous surface 39 the linear form of this model is given in eq 10 10 1 q e 1 q max k l c e 1 q max where ce mg l and qe mg g are metal ion concentration and adsorbed metal ion amount at equilibrium respectively kl is langmuir equilibrium constant l mg and qmax is the monolayer maximum adsorption capacity mg g the freundlich isotherm describes adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces and does not accept a single layer capacity due to the increase in the amount of adsorbed substance in the solution 49 the linearized form of model is as follows 11 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e kf l g and n are freundlich constants are associated with adsorption capacity and heterogeneity factor respectively the d r isotherm model was developed to clarify the effect of the porous structure of the adsorbent and the linear form of the model is given in eq 12 12 ln q e ln q m β ε 2 where qm is the monolayer adsorption capacity mg g β is a coefficient related to the energy of adsorption mol2 j2 and ε symbolizes the polanyi potential and can be calculated with eq 13 13 ε rtln 1 1 c e the β constant assists in calculating the adsorption energy e it provides information about the physical or chemical character of the adsorption the e value can be calculated with the following equation 14 e 1 2β based on the e values given in table 7 it can be said that the adsorption processes for both metals are physical 50 when fig 5 and table 7 are examined the freundlich equations for both pb ii and cu ii adsorption are more compatible than others because of the high r2 value 3 6 adsorption in binary metal systems in order to observe the competitive effects of pb ii and cu ii ions the removal of these ions by bsh was examined in the binary metal system the change in pb ii adsorption efficiency in the presence of cu ii ions was investigated by changing the cu ii ion concentration in the range from 0 to 40 mg l under constant optimum conditions obtained from ccd in a single system for pb ii and vice versa for cu ii the removal yields of cu ii and pb ii in the single metal system were 88 19 and 95 05 respectively in the case of binary adsorption studies with increasing amounts of competitive ions while pb ii removal decreased slightly cu ii removal decreased rapidly this shows that pb ii ions were preferably adsorbed on the surface of the bsh compared to cu ii ions considering fig 6 the adsorption performances in the binary metal systems were less than in single metal systems because of competition among the metal ions to reach the active sites on the adsorbent also as shown in fig 6 the results from the binary metal system were similar to those obtained from a single metal system pb ii cu ii it can be concluded that these results are related to the differences in metal characteristics and the resultant affinity for adsorption sites 51 52 in addition we can say that our adsorbent has important potential for effective removal of both metals especially in waste water containing pb ii and cu ii 4 conclusion the adsorption efficiency for heavy metal ions pb ii and cu ii on bsh from an aqueous solution was investigated using the batch adsorption method ccd was utilized to optimize the parameters affecting the adsorption efficiency in a single system as a result of numerical optimization the optimum conditions for initial ph co m and t in pb ii adsorption were 5 1 32 98 mg l 142 13 mg and 146 min and the optimum conditions in cu ii adsorption were 4 52 37 9 mg l 152 3 mg and 146 12 min respectively removal yield for pb ii and cu ii in these optimum conditions were determined as 95 08 and 88 19 respectively the obtained data were applied to the kinetic equations and found to comply with the pseudo second order model for both metals in addition it was found that both surface film and intraparticle diffusion contribute to the speed limiting step considering the information obtained from the weber morris intra particular diffusion model the isotherm studies showed that pb ii and cu ii adsorption equilibrium data were better suited to the freundlich isotherm model in a single metal system bsh exhibited much higher removal yields for pb ii compared to cu ii a similar situation was observed in the binary system it can be said that the affinity for pb ii to bsh is higher than that of cu ii finally bsh has important potential for effective removal of both metals especially in waste water containing both pb ii and cu ii acknowledgements i would like to thank ümit ecer and şakir yılmaz for their help with laboratory studies 
14351,chloroacetanilide class of herbicides such as acetochlor alachlor and butachlor widely used for the control of unwanted grasses and weeds in various crop cultivations are classified as b2 l2 and c classes of carcinogens by various environmental agencies extensive and uncontrolled usage of these herbicides create imbalance in the environment and so fate of these compounds become a subject of concern in this review an attempt has been made to summarize the toxicological aspects and critically analyse the available remediation technologies of these herbicides the review proposes that biological methods in the presence of additional carbon sources have a better probability for the complete mineralization of these herbicides application of the bacterial strain paracoccus sp has emerged as the most advantageous and sustainable remediation technology due to its wide spectrum of substrate specificity the bacterial strain is able to degrade 100 mg l of various chloroacetanilide herbicides within a span of 5 days among the physicochemical treatment technologies application of ozone for the treatment of the herbicides was found to be highly efficient however production of ozone resistant by products reduces its efficiency for subsequent use the review also hints on the potential research gap and the need of precision required for the studies in the areas of integrated treatment technologies fate of degradation residues and intermediate metabolites etc for better understanding of their fate and to achieve complete removal from the environment keywords bioremediation chloroacetanilide herbicide microbial degradation pollution 1 introduction the ever so increasing population has resulted in increase in demand of agro products thus exerting immense pressure on the agricultural sector hence to increase the annual crop yield various effective strategies have been employed however loss due to various biological entities collectively known as pests has become a major hindrance to achieve the required target 1 application of a set of synthetic chemicals altogether known as pesticides for the sole purpose of crop protection has become one of the indispensable elements of modern agriculture extensive usage of the pesticides has created a concern in general as their residues are widely found in various ecological niches 2 based on the target organisms chemical composition environmental persistence and mode of action pesticides have been classified into various subgroups pesticides were identified as fungicides prevents the growth of fungi herbicides inhibits the growth of weeds and unwanted grasses rodenticides lethal to rodents insecticides used to kill insects etc based on the targeted pests 3 among the pesticides herbicides account for the highest percentage of being produced globally since they have become an integral part of modern agricultural practices 4 similarly based on the chemical composition of the active ingredients pesticides have been classified as carbamates chloroacetanilides organochlorines organosulfur organophosphates pyrethroids etc invented since 1960s chloroacetanilide class of herbicides constitutes one of the major class of herbicides to be used worldwide in the agricultural sector for the control of broadleaf weeds and annual grasses epa 2011 these are primarily the n alkoxyalkyl n chloroacetyl substituted derivatives of aniline available studies reported that a sharp increase in the usage of the chloroacetanilide herbicides has been observed in the recent past where around 90 million kg of the herbicide belonging to this class had been used in us alone for the year 2012 5 chloroacetanilide herbicides are commonly used for the crops like corn cotton maize rice soybean sugar cane beetroot sunflower etc 6 7 these herbicides are relatively high water soluble and are persistent in nature 8 hence their residues and their metabolites are often detected in the soil as well as in surface and groundwater 9 11 the most commonly used chloroacetanilide herbicides are acetochlor alachlor butachlor metolachlor s metolachlor pretilachlor propachlor and propisochlor 12 these herbicides are listed as b2 l2 and c classes of carcinogens by the usepa and reported to have moderate to high chronic toxicity 13 14 ecotoxicological studies suggested that these herbicides are the causal agents for dna damage and tumour induction in rats fishes and human cells revealed during in vitro studies 15 18 therefore much attention has been paid to the fate and removal of these herbicides from the environment fig 1 a complete understanding of the properties and environmental fate of these herbicides will assist the researchers to fathom the grievousness of the situation and explore all the feasible ways to control it the review aims to present an overall view on the toxicity environmental fate and available remediation strategies so that the reader could access the existing research gap in the studies till date and carry on further research for the efficient elimination of chloroacetanilide herbicides from the environment a detailed account of the various studies focusing on the remediation of these herbicides will give the opportunity for the application of specific treatment technology as per the suitability of the operating conditions 2 physical and chemical properties acetochlor one of the most widely produced chloroacetanilide class of herbicide used globally for the control of small seeded broad leafed weeds like morning glory yellow nutsedge pigweed cocklebur and marigold and annual grasses such as sweet buffalo grass goosegrass feather top chloris and crabgrass 19 20 even though developed in the year 1971 by monsanto co and zeneca the herbicide was granted conditional registration by usepa in the year 1994 to be used as a substitute of another chloroacetanilide class of herbicide alachlor 21 22 it is predominantly used in regions of latin america africa and europe and is one of the most commonly used herbicide in china and united states 23 25 it is used as pre emergent or pre planting herbicide in a wide range of crops such as cabbage sweet and silage corn peas and onions potatoes pop seed sunflowers plums citrus apricots apples pears sorghum soybean and beans coffee sugarbeet sugarcane etc 26 28 alachlor another selective systemic widely consumed chloroacetanilide class of herbicide used for the control of annual grasses such as barnyard grass crab grass goosegrass herringbone grass sweet buffalo grass and broadleaf weeds like chickweed pigweed purslane nutsedge sow thistle etc 29 the herbicide was developed by monsanto co in the year 1964 30 alachlor is primarily used as pre emergent or early post emergent herbicide all over the world 31 33 alachlor is broadly used in cultivations of brassicas corn cotton grain sorghum maize peanuts soybean radish oilseed rape and sugarcane 34 37 butachlor a synthetic chloroacetanilide class of herbicide developed by monsanto co in the year 1970 is widely used pre emergent or early post emergent herbicide for the control of annual grasses such as barnyard grass torpedo grass crab grass rye grass witch grass broad leaved weeds such as red deadnettle and freshwater submerged macrophytes such as hydrilla verticillata najas minor nechamendra alternifolia ottelia alismoides etc 29 30 38 butachlor was initially introduced in the year 1973 in japan for weed control in rice irrigation it is predominantly used in africa asia and south america 39 40 it is one of the top three herbicides used in china and asia alone consumes approximately 4 5 107 kg per year 41 42 butachlor is the first rice herbicide introduced in india and nearly 6750 metric tons of butachlor is used annually 43 44 butachlor is broadly used in cultivations of rice barley wheat tea beans corns soybeans peanuts etc 45 46 the physical and chemical properties of acetochlor alachlor and butachlor have been listed in table 1 3 environmental fate of the herbicides following its introduction in the united states acetochlor has become the third most commonly detected herbicide in the environment after atrazine and glyphosate 47 acetochlor and its intermediates are easily adsorbed by the soil and their movement is mediated via several pathways such as leaching soil erosion surface runoff etc 48 49 based on the soil texture percentage of organic matter in the soil and the crop variety the amount of the acetochlor to be applied is decided however due to rainfall around 1 of the total acetochlor applied is runs off the surface of the soil and contaminates the local waterbodies 21 26 47 as a result of its high stability persistent nature and these transport mechanisms acetochlor is highly prevalent in the water bodies as well as in the soil persistence of acetochlor in the environment varies from weeks to months depending upon the type of soil and the climatic condition of the place 50 51 studies suggested that the half life of acetochlor varies from 8 to 110 days in subsurface soil while it is around 18 days for surface soils 52 53 dissipation of acetochlor during the first week of the application is quite quick however the rate of dissipation slows down from the following week onwards 54 in the aquatic ecosystem acetochlor is primarily degraded by photolytic method rather than the microbial degradation 24 55 however it is quite opposite in case of the soil where the major pathway is the microbial one 56 it is a common trend that during the degradation of the chloroacetanilide compounds the chlorine atom is removed and a sulfonic acid functional group is being added to the parent compound thus giving it an enhanced water solubility 57 the most commonly detected intermediate products in case of acetochlor includes acetochlor ethane sulfonic acids esa and acetochlor oxanilic acid oa 47 hence due to its widespread usage and high leaching capacity acetochlor and its transformation products possess a huge threat both in soil as well as in water ecosystem 58 accordingly alachlor is one of the severely restricted chemicals in the present scenario since 1985 alachlor has been banned in canada due to its potential health implications whereas the european community implemented recent regulatory actions to ban its usage in the europe in the recent past 59 60 hence its occurrence in the environment is particularly worrisome dissipation of the herbicide and its metabolites from the ecosystem takes place by the virtue of various processes such as chemical degradation leaching photo degradation microbial degradation and volatilization etc 61 62 the european commission ec has enlisted alachlor as a priority substance ps as per its dictum directive 2000 60 ec 63 the amount of the alachlor to be applied is decided as per the variety of the crop organic content and type of the soil the herbicide and its intermediates are highly water soluble and their sorption on to the soil is highly limited 64 hence offsite transportation via leaching and surface runoffs of these compounds is an issue of great concern 65 the downward movement of alachlor to contaminate the groundwater is primarily controlled by the retention properties of the soil and various transformation processes 66 soil temperature moisture and climatic conditions are the important factors that affects the persistence of the herbicide and its intermediate compounds in the soil 67 with respect to environment alachlor is highly persistent and possesses the possibility of bio magnification on moving up in the food chain 68 with a half life ranging from 2 to 50 days in the surface soil alachlor tends to degrade rapidly in the soil 69 thus the degradation products of alachlor such as alachlor esa were detected more frequently 20 times than the parent compound itself 70 extensive usage for the agricultural practices for quite a prolonged time and high persistence made alachlor a potential risk for both aquatic as well as terrestrial ecosystem and human exposure not only to the farmers and professional applicators but also to the general populations 71 the herbicide residues enter the aquatic ecosystem through various means such as direct surface runoffs effluent of the manufacturing and formulation unit plants leaching improper management of the equipment and various manufacturing and formulation practices accidental spillages etc 72 the half life of butachlor varies from 2 67 to 5 33 days in soil and 1 65 2 48 days in water 73 butachlor is released into the environment through various sources such as wastewater from its manufacturing or formulation units excessive usage in the waterbodies for controlling the macrophytes runoff from the agricultural fields due to rainfall accidental spillage during production transportation or application 74 previously several studies have reported that the factors such as soil types moisture and organic matter content of the soil influences the persistence of butachlor in the environment 75 76 since butachlor has such high soil adsorption coefficient koc 700 it s mobility in the soil is almost negligible and it bio concentrates in the aquatic ecosystems rather easily 77 hence it poses a potential threat to both aquatic as well as terrestrial eco system and human health by entering the food chains 78 extensive usage of butachlor resulted in deleterious effects on the environment higher concentration of butachlor residues as well as its metabolites has been detected in various agricultural soils as well as ground and surface waters 11 several studies have been undertaken to determine the pernicious effect of butachlor in the environment 4 toxicity evaluating the potential toxicity towards the non target organisms previous studies reveal that acetochlor has a negative impact on both the aquatic as well as terrestrial ecosystems the herbicide has been known to exhibit toxic effects towards a wide range of organisms ranging from earthworms to human beings 79 85 it exerts an inhibitory effect on the soil microbial community which indirectly affects the growth and reproduction of the earthworms 86 87 it is both mutagenic as well as genotoxic in nature 88 89 it has been reported that acetochlor induces the sister chromatid exchange in human lymphocytes and mutates the germ cells in male rats 15 90 in vitro studies reveal that the compound alters the thyroid hormone dependent gene expression and hence has been listed as a suspected endocrine disruptor by the usepa and european union 27 82 91 previous studies have reported significant incidences of the carcinogenic nature of the acetochlor which causes bone liver lungs nasal cavity stomach and thyroid tumors in the rats tadpoles and minnows 16 92 94 in case of animal and human cell culture studies acetochlor was suspected for the induction of glutathione dependent cytotoxicity in the cells 95 since it is likely to be carcinogenic to the humans 96 acetochlor has been identified as a probable human carcinogen and labelled as b 2 carcinogen by us environmental protection agency in the year 1994 22 97 being anthropogenic alachlor interferes with the various biochemical processes among the non target organisms 98 100 alachlor induces an antagonistic impact on the production of dna rna glycogen metabolic enzymes and total proteins in freshwater fishes such as channa punctatus bloch clarias batrachus etc while it increases metabolic enzymes due to the toxic stress 101 102 not only limited to the freshwater fishes alachlor also affects significantly to the marine aquatic life such as turbot fish psetta maxima resulting in delay in the hatching processes embryogenic malfunctions skeletal deformations and pericardial oedema 103 even though no conclusive information regarding the genotoxicity and mutagenicity of the alachlor is available it is confirmatory that acute exposure of alachlor causes minor skin and eye irritation however long term exposure may lead to organ failure eye lesions and liver toxicity 104 105 despite its low acute toxicity alachlor has been enlisted as b2 group carcinogen by usepa and relegated it to be highly toxic to the humans 106 108 since butachlor is extensively used for controlling freshwater macrophytes the freshwater aquatic ecosystem is affected the most in vitro studies suggested that butachlor is mutagenic to freshwater fishes such as salmonella typhimurium 109 channa punctata 43 and tilapia zillii 110 studies pertaining to the genotoxic and cytotoxicity nature of butachlor towards the catfish clarias batrachus suggests that the concentration of butachlor is directly proportional to the degree of dna damage in the organism 18 111 112 remarkable amount of protein loss was also observed in liver and muscles at lethal as well as sublethal concentrations 113 exposure to sublethal concentration of butachlor affects negatively to freshwater shrimps paratya compressa improvisa and daphnia magna 114 and disrupts the reproductive process thyroid hormones and sex steroids in zebrafish danio rerio 115 in terrestrial ecosystem butachlor is reported to exhibit toxicity towards earthworms and has a negative impact on soil microflora by affecting the microbial community structures and enzymatic activities adversely 45 116 in vitro studies suggests that butachlor exerts genotoxic effects on amphibians and induces stomach tumours in rats apoptosis in mammalian cells and oxidative dna damage in human cells 46 117 120 butachlor is reported to be clastogenic cytotoxic and carcinogenic in nature 109 121 123 5 available remediation technology 5 1 acetochlor owing to its toxicity the persistent nature perspicuous threat to human health and the ecosystem it is highly necessary to formulate various effective approaches to remediate acetochlor from the environment various studies pertaining to the abiotic as well as biotic degradation of herbicide acetochlor has been reported in the past table 2 anodic fenton treatment aft has earlier been reported for the remediation of various pesticides including chloroacetanilide herbicides in the aqueous solution 124 it is an electrochemical treatment method which employs the fenton reaction which generates the hydroxyl radicals and strong oxidants for the degradation of the organic contaminants via hydrogen abstraction method in their study friedman et al treated acetochlor along with the other chloroacetanilide herbicides such as butachlor alachlor metolachlor and propachlor by the aft and found that the active ingredients reactivity towards the hydroxyl radical is in the order of acetochlor metolachlor butachlor alachlor propachlor however the major drawback of the treatment method is that even though the parent compounds were removed from the aqueous medium and the biodegradability of the herbicide contaminated aqueous solutions increased complete mineralization could not be achieved by the method nevertheless this study has embarked on the path of hybridizing the biotic and the abiotic treatment methods to achieve complete removal of the contaminants from the environment chemical oxidation of the herbicide acetochlor in the aqueous medium has been studied by zhang et al where they have used methods both single oxidants such as fenton s reagent hydrogen peroxide and potassium peroxymonopersulfate as well as by advanced oxidation processes aops by the combinations of these oxidants 125 based on the extent of decomposition the combined processes technology was found to be a better option as compared to the single oxidant method 126 moreover it was observed that at lower ph value decomposition of potassium peroxymonopersulfate into hydroxyl radicals is negligible and hence only the direct potassium peroxymonopersulfate attacks on the organic compound 127 but increasing the ph increase in the amount of hydroxyl radicals was observed which are far more efficient oxidants than the potassium peroxymonopersulfate this clearly establishes the effect of ph on the studied treatment technology since this method is far more dependent on the ph of the medium application of this technique for the treatment of industrial wastewater is highly cost ineffective and labour oriented ozonisation and photo oxidation using uv radiations are among the few other options for the treatment of the herbicide acetochlor in aqueous solution 128 129 at low ph values the acetochlor directly reacts with the ozone and complete removal of this chloroacetanilide herbicide can be achieved however due to the formation of ozone resistant intermediates reduction in the total organic carbon content is significantly lower oxidization of molecular structure of acetochlor increases the biodegradability of the aqueous medium and also reduces the toxicity of the solution ozonisation is far more effective at high ph conditions achieved by the addition of co oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide or fenton reagent similarly photo oxidation of acetochlor resulted in the production of fifteen intermediates 129 however in vitro assays demonstrated that the photoproducts generated from the photolysis of the acetochlor are potentially toxic in nature and engenders a significant estrogenic activity however microbial transformation is considered as the most important route for the removal of any contaminant from the environment 130 131 it is preferred over the other conventional treatment methods due to its ability to degrade the contaminant completely and it has no other added disadvantages such as toxic end products or cost ineffectiveness 132 133 a few studies have been reported on the bioremediation of acetochlor either by the isolated microbial strains or by the mixed consortium xu et al reported a bacterial strain pseudomonas oleovorans lca2 that has the capability to degrade 98 03 of acetochlor 7 6 mg l within 7 days and has a tolerance up to 200 mg l of acetochlor 134 it was also reported that on increasing the concentration of the acetochlor the rate of degradation decreases thus increasing the degradation cycle gc ms analysis of the culture medium assisted in the identification of biodegradation products and elucidation of the plausible degradation pathway which involved various chemical reactions such as c dealkylation dechlorination dehydrogenation hydroxylation and n dealkylation degradation of acetochlor resulted in cmepa 2 chloro n methoxymethyl n 2 ethyl 6 methyl phenyl acetamide n ethoxymethyl n 2 ethyl 6 methyl benzoylamide 2 aldehyde n ethoxymethyl n 2 ethyl 6 methylphenyl acetamide n ethoxymethyl n 2 ethyl 6 methylphenyl acetamide and 2 hydroxy n ethoxymethyl n 2 ethyl 6 methylphenyl acetamide as the main intermediate products several other bacterial strains such as paracoccus 120 135 achromobacter 97 catellibacterium caeni 136 has also been reported for the efficient degradation of acetochlor where the bacterial strains were isolated either from the activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant or the pesticide contaminated soils el nahhal et al investigated the acetochlor bioremediation efficiency of the cyanobacterial mats isolated from the wadi gaza of the mediterranean sea beach 96 the cyanobacterial mats were subjected to various concentration of acetochlor and it was observed that acetochlor was degraded in both soil as well as water system efficiently durães sette et al reported a streptomyces community that has the ability to degrade acetochlor 62 the biodegradation efficiency of the bacterial community increases with repeated exposure of increasing concentration of acetochlor 137 138 xu et al isolated four acetochlor degrading microbial consortium from acetochlor contaminated soil 139 complete acetochlor degradation was achieved at lower substrate concentration while increasing the concentration of acetochlor subsequently changes the rate and efficiency of acetochlor degradation of each microbial consortium even though the dominant bacterial strains in each microbial consortium were been isolated for the purpose of identification no single isolate has been able to degrade acetochlor efficiently other than acetochlor the mixed bacterial consortia were also able to degrade other chloroacetanilide class of herbicides such as alachlor propachlor and metolachlor interdependence among the bacterial strains within the consortium for the complete degradation of acetochlor has been established by li et al 140 the microbial consortium isolated from the activated sludge consists of two bacterial strains identified as sphingobium quisquiliarum dc 2 and sphingobium baderi de 13 the strain dc 2 was able to transform acetochlor to cmepa 2 chloro n 2 methyl 6 ethylphenyl acetamide which further transforms into 2 methyl 6 ethylaniline mea the amide bond cleavage of the cmepa was governed by the enzyme amidase which was encoded by the gene cmeh however the strain dc 2 was incapable to degrade the intermediate product mea the strain de 13 which is unable to metabolize acetochlor has the capability to degrade mea into intermediate 2 methyl 6 ethylaminophenol meaoh which was further converted into 2 methyl 6 ethylbenzoquinoneimine mebqi similar reports on cooperative metabolism of acetochlor have been proposed by hou et al 22 where they isolated the microbial consortium t3 comprising of rhodococcus sp t3 1 delftia sp t3 6 and sphingobium sp mea3 1 the consortium was isolated from the soil sample collected from acetochlor contaminated site and is capable of degrading 100 mg l of acetochlor and butachlor completely within 6 days while the microbial strain t3 1 coverts acetochlor to cmepa which was further converted into mea by the strain t3 6 mea was further mineralized by the spingomonad strain mea3 1 which was identified based on the intermediate metabolites several studies confirmed that 2 chloro n 2 ethyl 6 methyl benzene acetamide and 2 methyl 6 ethylaniline mea are the major intermediate metabolites of acetochlor biodegradation 141 142 further it has been recorded that n deethoxymethylation is the most important step in the acetochlor mineralization which is regulated by a multicomponent enzyme n deethoxymethylase that catalyses the conversion of acetochlor to cmepa 143 the enzyme was encoded by the gene cluster ethabcd 5 2 alachlor various studies pertaining to both abiotic and biotic degradation of herbicide alachlor has been reported in the past table 3 disinfection of drinking water by application of ozone to oxidize various contaminants such as alachlor is one of the widespread technique used globally however complete removal of alachlor at water plants could not be achieved by the conventional ozonation technique 144 145 increasing the dosage however have resulted in the significant enhancement of the degradation of alachlor 146 qiang et al investigated the application of advanced oxidation process aop comprising ozonation h2o2 pretreatment for the degradation of alachlor in aqueous medium 147 the degradation byproducts formed during the aop were 2 chloro 20 acetyl 60 ethyl n methoxymethyl acetanilide 8 ethyl quinoline 2 chloro 20 60 diacetyl n methoxymethyl acetanilide n 2 6 diethylphenyl methyleneamine 1 chloroacetyl 2 hydro 3 ketone 7 acetyl indole 8 ethyl 3 4 dihydro quinoline and hydroxylated isomer of alachlor the study reported that degradation of alachlor occurred via several processes such as cleavage cyclization and n dealkylation of the aromatic ring and oxidation of the arylethyl group of the compound the toxicity of the aop treated aqueous solution was examined by the daphnia magna bioassay and it was found to have reduced slightly keeping in view their higher efficiency ease of use and eco friendliness fenton systems have also been studied extensively for the remediation of contaminants from the environment 148 149 in the classic fenton system h2o2 decomposition catalyzed by fe ii generates the hydroxyl radicals which have the capability to oxidize the most of the hydrocarbons non selectively 150 151 however during the fenton reactions the ferric ions accumulates quickly since the rate of reaction between the ferric ions with hydrogen peroxide is relatively slower than that of the ferrous ions thus the accumulated ferric ions precipitates and slows down the reactions by blocking it 152 153 however application of the environmental friendly protocatechuic acid pca can improve the alachlor degradation efficiency of the fenton system significantly almost by 10 000 times 154 the spectacular enhancement in the degradation efficiency may be attributed to the protocatechuic ligand that forms stable complexes with the ferric ions and prevents them from precipitation and thus enhancing the hydroxyl radical generation indirectly similarly gamma irradiation has been proved to be another promising alternative for the removal of refractory compounds such as cefaclor 155 methyl tert butyl ether mtbe 156 fluorine 157 and nitrobenzene 158 from the water gamma irradiation coupled with hydrogen peroxide enhances the degradation of alachlor and removal of total organic carbon in an aqueous solution 159 however increase in the concentration of h2o2 reduces the degradation efficiency since it acts as the hydroxyl radical scavenger and moreover complete degradation of the alachlor along with its by products cannot be achieved by this process laboratory scale application of nanoscale zero valent iron particles for the reduction of alachlor from the aqueous medium stipulated it to be another viable option for remediation of high concentration of pesticide waste 160 161 the study suggested for the application of the technology for on site remediation as well as for the treatment of contaminations generated due to accidental spillage during application or storage of the herbicide in presence of the nanoparticle alachlor degradation was found to be complete rapid and the reaction product was found to be dechlorinated alachlor however the main drawback of application of such technologies is that these technologies depend on the fact that most of the pesticides contains moieties which when coupled with the zerovalent nanoparticles get reduced and the intermediate metabolites obtained are found to be more toxic and environmentally hazardous than the parent compound the conventional as well as the advanced physicochemical processes do have certain limitations such as secondary effluent generation intermediate production high operational cost low removal efficiency which makes them inefficient for their application in in situ remediation of alachlor 145 162 alachlor degradation in the environment is majorly a microbial process 163 application of microbial strain for the remediation of alachlor from the environment had been studied since long 164 in previous studies several microorganisms have been reported for their alachlor degrading potentiality tiedje and hagedorn reported the biodegradation of alachlor and the intermediate degradation pathway by the soil fungal strain chaltomium globosum 165 the intermediate metabolites described in the study were 2 6 diethyl n methoxymethyl aniline 2 chloro 2 6 diethylacetanilide l chloroacetyl 2 3 dihydro 7 ethylindole and 2 6 diethylaniline they have also reported that the microbe is capable of degrading the intermediates 2 chloro 2 6 diethylacetanilide and 2 6 diethylaniline further into non toxic end products ferrey et al have reported three white rot fungi ceriporiopsis subvermispora phlebia tremellosa and phanerochaete chrysosporium having the capability of mineralizing alachlor 166 however the strains c subvermispora and p tremellosa demonstrated better degradation efficiency than p chrysosporium the actinomycetes displays a wide array of metabolic diversity and hence are actively involved in the degradation of several xenobiotic compounds in the environment 167 the soil actinomycetes streptomyces ps1 5 was reported to have the potential to degraded alachlor in both aqueous as well as soil medium 168 however it uses either chitin or glucose as the primary carbon source and ammonium sulfate or casamino acids as the source of nitrogen similar results have been reported by sette et al where the streptomyces strains isolated through selective enrichment technique were able to tolerate up to 720 mg l of alachlor and are able to degrade up to 72 mg l of alachlor completely in the mineral salt medium 169 previously several bacterial strains such as bacillus cruciviae bacillus brevis pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida have been reported to tolerate and degrade alachlor 170 nevertheless the degradation efficiency of the subjected bacterial strains were significantly low however recent studies revealed that the bacterial strain paracoccus sp strain fly 8 isolated from the contaminated soil has the ability to utilize alachlor efficiently as the sole source of carbon and energy 120 the study focuses on the influence of molecular structure of the contaminant on the rate of biodegradation by the microbial strain it is inferred that the biodegradation efficiency reduces significantly if the alkoxymethyl side chain is substituted with alkoxyethyl side chain similarly the length of the alkoxymethyl of the amide group significantly varies the degradation efficiency of the microbial strain although several microorganisms have been reported no single or mixed culture is able to degrade alachlor efficiently and completely most of the studies pertaining to the biodegradation of alachlor reports that alachlor can only be mineralized through co metabolism 56 171 the earliest study to be reported on the biodegradation of alachlor via cometabolism was on the fungal strain rhizoctonia solani which was reported to co metabolize alachlor in presence of another primary carbon source glucose 172 additional carbon sources such as glucose or sucrose increases the alachlor mineralizing ability of the microbial strains 34 this infers that the microbes utilizes alachlor side chain as the secondary carbon source without attacking the aromatic ring 173 similar results have been reported for the microscopic fungus paecilomyces marquandii which has the ability to co metabolize alachlor by n acetyl oxidation in presence of another primary carbon source 174 the proteomics and metabolomics data revealed that even though the growth and glucose consumption rates decreases in presence of alachlor the rate of glycolysis and tca cycle increases and novel supplementary materials and reactive oxygen species scavengers were formed proteomic analysis implicates that the overexpression of the enzyme cyanide hydratase in presence of alachlor may be due to the fact that it is the key enzyme involved in alachlor biodegradation process initially it was reported that biodegradation of alachlor in active soil is almost 50 times faster than in the sterilized soil however the alachlor degradation enhances in soil samples which has a history of application of alachlor 175 when the soil is augmented with additional carbon sources such as soybean stubble or ground corn concentration of residual alachlor in the soil sample decreases significantly thus suggesting the stimulation of activity of the indigenous soil microflora resulting in the enhancement of the co metabolic transformation of the alachlor a microbial consortium capable of degrading alachlor along with another pesticide atrazine was isolated from the soil sample of a 100 year old mix old site 176 five bacterial strains comprising the microbial consortium were pseudomonas putida pseudomonas marginalis alcaligenes xylosoxydans subsp xylosoxydans alcaligenes xylosoxydans subsp denitrificans and providencia rustigianii the study reveals that the degradation of alachlor by the microbial consortium starts only after the biotransformation of the atrazine begins thus confirming the fact that biodegradation of alachlor was dependent on the presence of the co contaminant atrazine dehgani et al have studied the effect of additional carbon and nitrogen source on biodegradation of alachlor by the bacterial consortium and evaluating the feasibility of the bio stimulation process in the soil culture 105 highest alachlor removal rate was observed in the presence of glucose and sodium citrate as the additional carbon source and ammonium nitrate as the additional nitrogen sources as compared to the other compounds munoz et al have reported biodegradation of alachlor by the yeast candida xestobii isolated from the luvisol a soil type contaminated with chloroacetanilide herbicides 177 more than 80 of the initial alachlor concentration was degraded by the strain c xestobii within 2 days in presence of yeast extract as the additional carbon sources microbial transformation of alachlor in anaerobic conditions is yet to be explored completely aquifer and sediment samples incubated under anaerobic conditions yielded lower removal rates as compared to its aerobic counterparts 51 similarly modest removal efficiency ranging between 30 60 of the initial alachlor concentration of 100 mg l was observed on incubation of contaminated agricultural soil in anaerobic conditions 178 however better anaerobic losses were being observed in anaerobic sewage sludge digester but only on the addition of sterilized sludge digestor materials thus suggesting the co metabolic activity of the substrates 5 3 butachlor owing to the high stability and persistent nature of the butachlor and the potential threats it possess to the ecosystem 78 179 concern regarding its environmental fate and the efficient remediation have become a subject of great concern in the recent past several studies have reported that involves removal of butachlor from the environment by both biotic as well as abiotic processes table 4 degradation of butachlor in the environment follows the first order kinetics 180 application of laboratory synthesized nanoscale zerovalent iron particles is a potential alternative for the removal of butachlor from the aqueous medium 181 the laboratory synthesized zerovalent iron particles gets oxidized and forms iron oxide which acts as a reductant and dechlorinated butachlor in the aqueous medium the study reports more than 90 degradation of 20 mg l of butachlor and removal of the various intermediate toxic metabolites of butachlor that are usually found in the environment another nanomaterial that has been used for the removal of butachlor form the environment was titanium dioxide nanoparticles 182 the study reported mineralization of butachlor by the immobilized titanium dioxide nanoparticle following a first order degradation kinetics microbial degradation has been proved to be a promising alternative for the redressal of chloroacetanilide class of herbicides from the environment 120 however to the very best of our knowledge a very limited study on biodegradation of butachlor has been reported previously soil fungi fusarium solani and fusarium oxysporum are among the first microbial strains to be reported for their ability to degrade butachlor effectively 183 a plausible degradation pathway involving debutoxymethylation dechlorination dehydrogenation c dealkylation o dealkylation n dealkylation hydroxylation and cyclization producing around 30 32 types of metabolites has been proposed in the study similarly another soil fungus aspergillus niger that has the ability to utilize butachlor as well as other herbicides such as molinate and thiobencarb has been reported by torra reventos et al 184 the study described the utilization of the herbicides by the fungal strain in presence of sucrose as the primary carbon source under optimized growth conditions the strain has degraded 20 mg l of butachlor completely within 7 days under optimum growth conditions bacterial strain stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila js 1 isolated from the herbicide contaminated wheat rhizosphere has previously been reported for its ability to utilize butachlor as the sole carbon source the bacterial strain eliminated butachlor completely within 20 days at a rate constant of 0 17 d 1 from the soil 185 another bacterial strain paracoccus sp has been recurrently reported for its efficacious butachlor degrading ability ni et al identified the strain paracoccus sp y3b 1 from the activated sludge of a wastewater plant to degrade the chloroacetanilide herbicides acetochlor and pretilachlor along with butachlor with a degradation rate of 86 7 69 1 and 65 5 within 3 days 186 similar results have been reiterated in case of paracoccus sp strain fly 8 isolated from rice field soil 120 the study also elucidated the butachlor degradation pathway where butachlor was initially converted into alachlor by partial c dealkylation and then converted to 2 chloro n 2 6 dimethylphenyl acetamide by n dealkylation finally it was transformed into 2 6 diethylaniline which was further converted into aniline and catechol catechol was later oxidized through ortho cleavage pathway similar trends have also been reported in the bacterial strain rhodococcus sp b1 which could degrade 100 mg l butachlor within 5 days 187 the bacterial strain also followed similar butachlor metabolism pathway as described previously and the enzyme responsible for the n dealkylation of the side chain of the butachlor was identified as hydrolase enzyme designated as chlh butachlor been hydrolyzed by the enzyme results in the production of 2 chloro n 2 6 dimethylphenyl acetamide and butoxymethanol which could be utilized as the carbon source for the growth owing to the diverseness among butachlor degrading strains the butachlor degradation pathway in different microbial strains are diverse a different butachlor metabolic pathway based on the intermediate metabolite identification has been proposed in the novel strain catellibacterium caeni dca 1 t 136 as per the gc ms analysis five metabolites viz n hydroxymethyl 2 chloro n 2 6 diethylphenyl acetamide 2 chloro n 2 6 diethyl phenyl acetamide 2 6 diethyl phenyl ethoxymethyl carbamic acid n 2 6 diethyl phenyl n hydroxymethyl acetamide and n 2 6 diethyl phenyl n hydroxymethyl formamide were found to be produced during butachlor degradation by the strain dca 1 t moreover bioaugmentation of the bacterial strain in three different soils resulted in 57 2 90 4 removal of 50 mg kg butachlor in 5 days kim et al have reported the syntrophic degradation of butachlor by the bacterial strains mycobacterium sp j7a and sphingobium sp j7b isolated from rice cultivated soil 188 while the pair was capable of rapid degradation of 100 mg l of butachlor within 24 h they were unable to degrade butachlor completely when subjected individually the study demonstrated that the strain j7a transformed butachlor into 2 chloro n 2 6 diethylphenyl acetamide while the strain j7b subsequently mineralizes it completely through 2 6 diethylaniline in another study six bacterial and fungi strains isolated from butachlor contaminated agricultural soil were being reported which could utilize butachlor as the sole carbon and energy source 189 results suggested that among the isolated strains trichoderma viride and pseudomonas alcaligenes were found to degrade 50 mg kg of butachlor up to 98 and 75 after 15 and 21 days respectively 6 conclusion application of synthetic herbicides has improved the agricultural yield and productivity in the past decade their intensive utilization has an adverse effect on the environment hence it is highly necessary to work out variety of strategies for the treatment of the contaminated sites the present review has attempted to accumulate the work done till date on the various remediation technologies for the chloroacetanilide herbicides which will present insight to carry forward the work in the future without having any irretrievable effect on the environment but the primary drawback of these studies regarding the remediation of chloroacetanilide herbicides is that most of them are still at the laboratory scale and large scale applications using efficient treatment technology are yet to be explored to design an effective remediation technology additional research needs to be carried out in this field at present out of all the known abiotic and biotic remediation techniques each having its specific set of advantages and disadvantages application of microbial agents for the removal of herbicides from the contaminated ecosystems has emerged as a powerful alternative technology from an environmental and economic point of view however limited studies has been carried out in the direction of a more innovative integrated process approach where both biological as well as the physicochemical treatment technologies were combined to achieve a better removal efficiency similarly from the above discussion it was quite evident that focus of most of the studies have only been limited to the reduction in the concentration of the parent compounds the metabolites and transformation products tps formed during the degradation processes are yet to be explored significant attention should be paid in this direction as intermediates can have more deplorable effects than the parent compounds and little is known about the fate of the intermediate end products to date hence effort should be made in the coming years to achieve complete mineralization of the chloroacetanilide herbicides to avoid the problem arising from the same declarations of interest none funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
14351,chloroacetanilide class of herbicides such as acetochlor alachlor and butachlor widely used for the control of unwanted grasses and weeds in various crop cultivations are classified as b2 l2 and c classes of carcinogens by various environmental agencies extensive and uncontrolled usage of these herbicides create imbalance in the environment and so fate of these compounds become a subject of concern in this review an attempt has been made to summarize the toxicological aspects and critically analyse the available remediation technologies of these herbicides the review proposes that biological methods in the presence of additional carbon sources have a better probability for the complete mineralization of these herbicides application of the bacterial strain paracoccus sp has emerged as the most advantageous and sustainable remediation technology due to its wide spectrum of substrate specificity the bacterial strain is able to degrade 100 mg l of various chloroacetanilide herbicides within a span of 5 days among the physicochemical treatment technologies application of ozone for the treatment of the herbicides was found to be highly efficient however production of ozone resistant by products reduces its efficiency for subsequent use the review also hints on the potential research gap and the need of precision required for the studies in the areas of integrated treatment technologies fate of degradation residues and intermediate metabolites etc for better understanding of their fate and to achieve complete removal from the environment keywords bioremediation chloroacetanilide herbicide microbial degradation pollution 1 introduction the ever so increasing population has resulted in increase in demand of agro products thus exerting immense pressure on the agricultural sector hence to increase the annual crop yield various effective strategies have been employed however loss due to various biological entities collectively known as pests has become a major hindrance to achieve the required target 1 application of a set of synthetic chemicals altogether known as pesticides for the sole purpose of crop protection has become one of the indispensable elements of modern agriculture extensive usage of the pesticides has created a concern in general as their residues are widely found in various ecological niches 2 based on the target organisms chemical composition environmental persistence and mode of action pesticides have been classified into various subgroups pesticides were identified as fungicides prevents the growth of fungi herbicides inhibits the growth of weeds and unwanted grasses rodenticides lethal to rodents insecticides used to kill insects etc based on the targeted pests 3 among the pesticides herbicides account for the highest percentage of being produced globally since they have become an integral part of modern agricultural practices 4 similarly based on the chemical composition of the active ingredients pesticides have been classified as carbamates chloroacetanilides organochlorines organosulfur organophosphates pyrethroids etc invented since 1960s chloroacetanilide class of herbicides constitutes one of the major class of herbicides to be used worldwide in the agricultural sector for the control of broadleaf weeds and annual grasses epa 2011 these are primarily the n alkoxyalkyl n chloroacetyl substituted derivatives of aniline available studies reported that a sharp increase in the usage of the chloroacetanilide herbicides has been observed in the recent past where around 90 million kg of the herbicide belonging to this class had been used in us alone for the year 2012 5 chloroacetanilide herbicides are commonly used for the crops like corn cotton maize rice soybean sugar cane beetroot sunflower etc 6 7 these herbicides are relatively high water soluble and are persistent in nature 8 hence their residues and their metabolites are often detected in the soil as well as in surface and groundwater 9 11 the most commonly used chloroacetanilide herbicides are acetochlor alachlor butachlor metolachlor s metolachlor pretilachlor propachlor and propisochlor 12 these herbicides are listed as b2 l2 and c classes of carcinogens by the usepa and reported to have moderate to high chronic toxicity 13 14 ecotoxicological studies suggested that these herbicides are the causal agents for dna damage and tumour induction in rats fishes and human cells revealed during in vitro studies 15 18 therefore much attention has been paid to the fate and removal of these herbicides from the environment fig 1 a complete understanding of the properties and environmental fate of these herbicides will assist the researchers to fathom the grievousness of the situation and explore all the feasible ways to control it the review aims to present an overall view on the toxicity environmental fate and available remediation strategies so that the reader could access the existing research gap in the studies till date and carry on further research for the efficient elimination of chloroacetanilide herbicides from the environment a detailed account of the various studies focusing on the remediation of these herbicides will give the opportunity for the application of specific treatment technology as per the suitability of the operating conditions 2 physical and chemical properties acetochlor one of the most widely produced chloroacetanilide class of herbicide used globally for the control of small seeded broad leafed weeds like morning glory yellow nutsedge pigweed cocklebur and marigold and annual grasses such as sweet buffalo grass goosegrass feather top chloris and crabgrass 19 20 even though developed in the year 1971 by monsanto co and zeneca the herbicide was granted conditional registration by usepa in the year 1994 to be used as a substitute of another chloroacetanilide class of herbicide alachlor 21 22 it is predominantly used in regions of latin america africa and europe and is one of the most commonly used herbicide in china and united states 23 25 it is used as pre emergent or pre planting herbicide in a wide range of crops such as cabbage sweet and silage corn peas and onions potatoes pop seed sunflowers plums citrus apricots apples pears sorghum soybean and beans coffee sugarbeet sugarcane etc 26 28 alachlor another selective systemic widely consumed chloroacetanilide class of herbicide used for the control of annual grasses such as barnyard grass crab grass goosegrass herringbone grass sweet buffalo grass and broadleaf weeds like chickweed pigweed purslane nutsedge sow thistle etc 29 the herbicide was developed by monsanto co in the year 1964 30 alachlor is primarily used as pre emergent or early post emergent herbicide all over the world 31 33 alachlor is broadly used in cultivations of brassicas corn cotton grain sorghum maize peanuts soybean radish oilseed rape and sugarcane 34 37 butachlor a synthetic chloroacetanilide class of herbicide developed by monsanto co in the year 1970 is widely used pre emergent or early post emergent herbicide for the control of annual grasses such as barnyard grass torpedo grass crab grass rye grass witch grass broad leaved weeds such as red deadnettle and freshwater submerged macrophytes such as hydrilla verticillata najas minor nechamendra alternifolia ottelia alismoides etc 29 30 38 butachlor was initially introduced in the year 1973 in japan for weed control in rice irrigation it is predominantly used in africa asia and south america 39 40 it is one of the top three herbicides used in china and asia alone consumes approximately 4 5 107 kg per year 41 42 butachlor is the first rice herbicide introduced in india and nearly 6750 metric tons of butachlor is used annually 43 44 butachlor is broadly used in cultivations of rice barley wheat tea beans corns soybeans peanuts etc 45 46 the physical and chemical properties of acetochlor alachlor and butachlor have been listed in table 1 3 environmental fate of the herbicides following its introduction in the united states acetochlor has become the third most commonly detected herbicide in the environment after atrazine and glyphosate 47 acetochlor and its intermediates are easily adsorbed by the soil and their movement is mediated via several pathways such as leaching soil erosion surface runoff etc 48 49 based on the soil texture percentage of organic matter in the soil and the crop variety the amount of the acetochlor to be applied is decided however due to rainfall around 1 of the total acetochlor applied is runs off the surface of the soil and contaminates the local waterbodies 21 26 47 as a result of its high stability persistent nature and these transport mechanisms acetochlor is highly prevalent in the water bodies as well as in the soil persistence of acetochlor in the environment varies from weeks to months depending upon the type of soil and the climatic condition of the place 50 51 studies suggested that the half life of acetochlor varies from 8 to 110 days in subsurface soil while it is around 18 days for surface soils 52 53 dissipation of acetochlor during the first week of the application is quite quick however the rate of dissipation slows down from the following week onwards 54 in the aquatic ecosystem acetochlor is primarily degraded by photolytic method rather than the microbial degradation 24 55 however it is quite opposite in case of the soil where the major pathway is the microbial one 56 it is a common trend that during the degradation of the chloroacetanilide compounds the chlorine atom is removed and a sulfonic acid functional group is being added to the parent compound thus giving it an enhanced water solubility 57 the most commonly detected intermediate products in case of acetochlor includes acetochlor ethane sulfonic acids esa and acetochlor oxanilic acid oa 47 hence due to its widespread usage and high leaching capacity acetochlor and its transformation products possess a huge threat both in soil as well as in water ecosystem 58 accordingly alachlor is one of the severely restricted chemicals in the present scenario since 1985 alachlor has been banned in canada due to its potential health implications whereas the european community implemented recent regulatory actions to ban its usage in the europe in the recent past 59 60 hence its occurrence in the environment is particularly worrisome dissipation of the herbicide and its metabolites from the ecosystem takes place by the virtue of various processes such as chemical degradation leaching photo degradation microbial degradation and volatilization etc 61 62 the european commission ec has enlisted alachlor as a priority substance ps as per its dictum directive 2000 60 ec 63 the amount of the alachlor to be applied is decided as per the variety of the crop organic content and type of the soil the herbicide and its intermediates are highly water soluble and their sorption on to the soil is highly limited 64 hence offsite transportation via leaching and surface runoffs of these compounds is an issue of great concern 65 the downward movement of alachlor to contaminate the groundwater is primarily controlled by the retention properties of the soil and various transformation processes 66 soil temperature moisture and climatic conditions are the important factors that affects the persistence of the herbicide and its intermediate compounds in the soil 67 with respect to environment alachlor is highly persistent and possesses the possibility of bio magnification on moving up in the food chain 68 with a half life ranging from 2 to 50 days in the surface soil alachlor tends to degrade rapidly in the soil 69 thus the degradation products of alachlor such as alachlor esa were detected more frequently 20 times than the parent compound itself 70 extensive usage for the agricultural practices for quite a prolonged time and high persistence made alachlor a potential risk for both aquatic as well as terrestrial ecosystem and human exposure not only to the farmers and professional applicators but also to the general populations 71 the herbicide residues enter the aquatic ecosystem through various means such as direct surface runoffs effluent of the manufacturing and formulation unit plants leaching improper management of the equipment and various manufacturing and formulation practices accidental spillages etc 72 the half life of butachlor varies from 2 67 to 5 33 days in soil and 1 65 2 48 days in water 73 butachlor is released into the environment through various sources such as wastewater from its manufacturing or formulation units excessive usage in the waterbodies for controlling the macrophytes runoff from the agricultural fields due to rainfall accidental spillage during production transportation or application 74 previously several studies have reported that the factors such as soil types moisture and organic matter content of the soil influences the persistence of butachlor in the environment 75 76 since butachlor has such high soil adsorption coefficient koc 700 it s mobility in the soil is almost negligible and it bio concentrates in the aquatic ecosystems rather easily 77 hence it poses a potential threat to both aquatic as well as terrestrial eco system and human health by entering the food chains 78 extensive usage of butachlor resulted in deleterious effects on the environment higher concentration of butachlor residues as well as its metabolites has been detected in various agricultural soils as well as ground and surface waters 11 several studies have been undertaken to determine the pernicious effect of butachlor in the environment 4 toxicity evaluating the potential toxicity towards the non target organisms previous studies reveal that acetochlor has a negative impact on both the aquatic as well as terrestrial ecosystems the herbicide has been known to exhibit toxic effects towards a wide range of organisms ranging from earthworms to human beings 79 85 it exerts an inhibitory effect on the soil microbial community which indirectly affects the growth and reproduction of the earthworms 86 87 it is both mutagenic as well as genotoxic in nature 88 89 it has been reported that acetochlor induces the sister chromatid exchange in human lymphocytes and mutates the germ cells in male rats 15 90 in vitro studies reveal that the compound alters the thyroid hormone dependent gene expression and hence has been listed as a suspected endocrine disruptor by the usepa and european union 27 82 91 previous studies have reported significant incidences of the carcinogenic nature of the acetochlor which causes bone liver lungs nasal cavity stomach and thyroid tumors in the rats tadpoles and minnows 16 92 94 in case of animal and human cell culture studies acetochlor was suspected for the induction of glutathione dependent cytotoxicity in the cells 95 since it is likely to be carcinogenic to the humans 96 acetochlor has been identified as a probable human carcinogen and labelled as b 2 carcinogen by us environmental protection agency in the year 1994 22 97 being anthropogenic alachlor interferes with the various biochemical processes among the non target organisms 98 100 alachlor induces an antagonistic impact on the production of dna rna glycogen metabolic enzymes and total proteins in freshwater fishes such as channa punctatus bloch clarias batrachus etc while it increases metabolic enzymes due to the toxic stress 101 102 not only limited to the freshwater fishes alachlor also affects significantly to the marine aquatic life such as turbot fish psetta maxima resulting in delay in the hatching processes embryogenic malfunctions skeletal deformations and pericardial oedema 103 even though no conclusive information regarding the genotoxicity and mutagenicity of the alachlor is available it is confirmatory that acute exposure of alachlor causes minor skin and eye irritation however long term exposure may lead to organ failure eye lesions and liver toxicity 104 105 despite its low acute toxicity alachlor has been enlisted as b2 group carcinogen by usepa and relegated it to be highly toxic to the humans 106 108 since butachlor is extensively used for controlling freshwater macrophytes the freshwater aquatic ecosystem is affected the most in vitro studies suggested that butachlor is mutagenic to freshwater fishes such as salmonella typhimurium 109 channa punctata 43 and tilapia zillii 110 studies pertaining to the genotoxic and cytotoxicity nature of butachlor towards the catfish clarias batrachus suggests that the concentration of butachlor is directly proportional to the degree of dna damage in the organism 18 111 112 remarkable amount of protein loss was also observed in liver and muscles at lethal as well as sublethal concentrations 113 exposure to sublethal concentration of butachlor affects negatively to freshwater shrimps paratya compressa improvisa and daphnia magna 114 and disrupts the reproductive process thyroid hormones and sex steroids in zebrafish danio rerio 115 in terrestrial ecosystem butachlor is reported to exhibit toxicity towards earthworms and has a negative impact on soil microflora by affecting the microbial community structures and enzymatic activities adversely 45 116 in vitro studies suggests that butachlor exerts genotoxic effects on amphibians and induces stomach tumours in rats apoptosis in mammalian cells and oxidative dna damage in human cells 46 117 120 butachlor is reported to be clastogenic cytotoxic and carcinogenic in nature 109 121 123 5 available remediation technology 5 1 acetochlor owing to its toxicity the persistent nature perspicuous threat to human health and the ecosystem it is highly necessary to formulate various effective approaches to remediate acetochlor from the environment various studies pertaining to the abiotic as well as biotic degradation of herbicide acetochlor has been reported in the past table 2 anodic fenton treatment aft has earlier been reported for the remediation of various pesticides including chloroacetanilide herbicides in the aqueous solution 124 it is an electrochemical treatment method which employs the fenton reaction which generates the hydroxyl radicals and strong oxidants for the degradation of the organic contaminants via hydrogen abstraction method in their study friedman et al treated acetochlor along with the other chloroacetanilide herbicides such as butachlor alachlor metolachlor and propachlor by the aft and found that the active ingredients reactivity towards the hydroxyl radical is in the order of acetochlor metolachlor butachlor alachlor propachlor however the major drawback of the treatment method is that even though the parent compounds were removed from the aqueous medium and the biodegradability of the herbicide contaminated aqueous solutions increased complete mineralization could not be achieved by the method nevertheless this study has embarked on the path of hybridizing the biotic and the abiotic treatment methods to achieve complete removal of the contaminants from the environment chemical oxidation of the herbicide acetochlor in the aqueous medium has been studied by zhang et al where they have used methods both single oxidants such as fenton s reagent hydrogen peroxide and potassium peroxymonopersulfate as well as by advanced oxidation processes aops by the combinations of these oxidants 125 based on the extent of decomposition the combined processes technology was found to be a better option as compared to the single oxidant method 126 moreover it was observed that at lower ph value decomposition of potassium peroxymonopersulfate into hydroxyl radicals is negligible and hence only the direct potassium peroxymonopersulfate attacks on the organic compound 127 but increasing the ph increase in the amount of hydroxyl radicals was observed which are far more efficient oxidants than the potassium peroxymonopersulfate this clearly establishes the effect of ph on the studied treatment technology since this method is far more dependent on the ph of the medium application of this technique for the treatment of industrial wastewater is highly cost ineffective and labour oriented ozonisation and photo oxidation using uv radiations are among the few other options for the treatment of the herbicide acetochlor in aqueous solution 128 129 at low ph values the acetochlor directly reacts with the ozone and complete removal of this chloroacetanilide herbicide can be achieved however due to the formation of ozone resistant intermediates reduction in the total organic carbon content is significantly lower oxidization of molecular structure of acetochlor increases the biodegradability of the aqueous medium and also reduces the toxicity of the solution ozonisation is far more effective at high ph conditions achieved by the addition of co oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide or fenton reagent similarly photo oxidation of acetochlor resulted in the production of fifteen intermediates 129 however in vitro assays demonstrated that the photoproducts generated from the photolysis of the acetochlor are potentially toxic in nature and engenders a significant estrogenic activity however microbial transformation is considered as the most important route for the removal of any contaminant from the environment 130 131 it is preferred over the other conventional treatment methods due to its ability to degrade the contaminant completely and it has no other added disadvantages such as toxic end products or cost ineffectiveness 132 133 a few studies have been reported on the bioremediation of acetochlor either by the isolated microbial strains or by the mixed consortium xu et al reported a bacterial strain pseudomonas oleovorans lca2 that has the capability to degrade 98 03 of acetochlor 7 6 mg l within 7 days and has a tolerance up to 200 mg l of acetochlor 134 it was also reported that on increasing the concentration of the acetochlor the rate of degradation decreases thus increasing the degradation cycle gc ms analysis of the culture medium assisted in the identification of biodegradation products and elucidation of the plausible degradation pathway which involved various chemical reactions such as c dealkylation dechlorination dehydrogenation hydroxylation and n dealkylation degradation of acetochlor resulted in cmepa 2 chloro n methoxymethyl n 2 ethyl 6 methyl phenyl acetamide n ethoxymethyl n 2 ethyl 6 methyl benzoylamide 2 aldehyde n ethoxymethyl n 2 ethyl 6 methylphenyl acetamide n ethoxymethyl n 2 ethyl 6 methylphenyl acetamide and 2 hydroxy n ethoxymethyl n 2 ethyl 6 methylphenyl acetamide as the main intermediate products several other bacterial strains such as paracoccus 120 135 achromobacter 97 catellibacterium caeni 136 has also been reported for the efficient degradation of acetochlor where the bacterial strains were isolated either from the activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant or the pesticide contaminated soils el nahhal et al investigated the acetochlor bioremediation efficiency of the cyanobacterial mats isolated from the wadi gaza of the mediterranean sea beach 96 the cyanobacterial mats were subjected to various concentration of acetochlor and it was observed that acetochlor was degraded in both soil as well as water system efficiently durães sette et al reported a streptomyces community that has the ability to degrade acetochlor 62 the biodegradation efficiency of the bacterial community increases with repeated exposure of increasing concentration of acetochlor 137 138 xu et al isolated four acetochlor degrading microbial consortium from acetochlor contaminated soil 139 complete acetochlor degradation was achieved at lower substrate concentration while increasing the concentration of acetochlor subsequently changes the rate and efficiency of acetochlor degradation of each microbial consortium even though the dominant bacterial strains in each microbial consortium were been isolated for the purpose of identification no single isolate has been able to degrade acetochlor efficiently other than acetochlor the mixed bacterial consortia were also able to degrade other chloroacetanilide class of herbicides such as alachlor propachlor and metolachlor interdependence among the bacterial strains within the consortium for the complete degradation of acetochlor has been established by li et al 140 the microbial consortium isolated from the activated sludge consists of two bacterial strains identified as sphingobium quisquiliarum dc 2 and sphingobium baderi de 13 the strain dc 2 was able to transform acetochlor to cmepa 2 chloro n 2 methyl 6 ethylphenyl acetamide which further transforms into 2 methyl 6 ethylaniline mea the amide bond cleavage of the cmepa was governed by the enzyme amidase which was encoded by the gene cmeh however the strain dc 2 was incapable to degrade the intermediate product mea the strain de 13 which is unable to metabolize acetochlor has the capability to degrade mea into intermediate 2 methyl 6 ethylaminophenol meaoh which was further converted into 2 methyl 6 ethylbenzoquinoneimine mebqi similar reports on cooperative metabolism of acetochlor have been proposed by hou et al 22 where they isolated the microbial consortium t3 comprising of rhodococcus sp t3 1 delftia sp t3 6 and sphingobium sp mea3 1 the consortium was isolated from the soil sample collected from acetochlor contaminated site and is capable of degrading 100 mg l of acetochlor and butachlor completely within 6 days while the microbial strain t3 1 coverts acetochlor to cmepa which was further converted into mea by the strain t3 6 mea was further mineralized by the spingomonad strain mea3 1 which was identified based on the intermediate metabolites several studies confirmed that 2 chloro n 2 ethyl 6 methyl benzene acetamide and 2 methyl 6 ethylaniline mea are the major intermediate metabolites of acetochlor biodegradation 141 142 further it has been recorded that n deethoxymethylation is the most important step in the acetochlor mineralization which is regulated by a multicomponent enzyme n deethoxymethylase that catalyses the conversion of acetochlor to cmepa 143 the enzyme was encoded by the gene cluster ethabcd 5 2 alachlor various studies pertaining to both abiotic and biotic degradation of herbicide alachlor has been reported in the past table 3 disinfection of drinking water by application of ozone to oxidize various contaminants such as alachlor is one of the widespread technique used globally however complete removal of alachlor at water plants could not be achieved by the conventional ozonation technique 144 145 increasing the dosage however have resulted in the significant enhancement of the degradation of alachlor 146 qiang et al investigated the application of advanced oxidation process aop comprising ozonation h2o2 pretreatment for the degradation of alachlor in aqueous medium 147 the degradation byproducts formed during the aop were 2 chloro 20 acetyl 60 ethyl n methoxymethyl acetanilide 8 ethyl quinoline 2 chloro 20 60 diacetyl n methoxymethyl acetanilide n 2 6 diethylphenyl methyleneamine 1 chloroacetyl 2 hydro 3 ketone 7 acetyl indole 8 ethyl 3 4 dihydro quinoline and hydroxylated isomer of alachlor the study reported that degradation of alachlor occurred via several processes such as cleavage cyclization and n dealkylation of the aromatic ring and oxidation of the arylethyl group of the compound the toxicity of the aop treated aqueous solution was examined by the daphnia magna bioassay and it was found to have reduced slightly keeping in view their higher efficiency ease of use and eco friendliness fenton systems have also been studied extensively for the remediation of contaminants from the environment 148 149 in the classic fenton system h2o2 decomposition catalyzed by fe ii generates the hydroxyl radicals which have the capability to oxidize the most of the hydrocarbons non selectively 150 151 however during the fenton reactions the ferric ions accumulates quickly since the rate of reaction between the ferric ions with hydrogen peroxide is relatively slower than that of the ferrous ions thus the accumulated ferric ions precipitates and slows down the reactions by blocking it 152 153 however application of the environmental friendly protocatechuic acid pca can improve the alachlor degradation efficiency of the fenton system significantly almost by 10 000 times 154 the spectacular enhancement in the degradation efficiency may be attributed to the protocatechuic ligand that forms stable complexes with the ferric ions and prevents them from precipitation and thus enhancing the hydroxyl radical generation indirectly similarly gamma irradiation has been proved to be another promising alternative for the removal of refractory compounds such as cefaclor 155 methyl tert butyl ether mtbe 156 fluorine 157 and nitrobenzene 158 from the water gamma irradiation coupled with hydrogen peroxide enhances the degradation of alachlor and removal of total organic carbon in an aqueous solution 159 however increase in the concentration of h2o2 reduces the degradation efficiency since it acts as the hydroxyl radical scavenger and moreover complete degradation of the alachlor along with its by products cannot be achieved by this process laboratory scale application of nanoscale zero valent iron particles for the reduction of alachlor from the aqueous medium stipulated it to be another viable option for remediation of high concentration of pesticide waste 160 161 the study suggested for the application of the technology for on site remediation as well as for the treatment of contaminations generated due to accidental spillage during application or storage of the herbicide in presence of the nanoparticle alachlor degradation was found to be complete rapid and the reaction product was found to be dechlorinated alachlor however the main drawback of application of such technologies is that these technologies depend on the fact that most of the pesticides contains moieties which when coupled with the zerovalent nanoparticles get reduced and the intermediate metabolites obtained are found to be more toxic and environmentally hazardous than the parent compound the conventional as well as the advanced physicochemical processes do have certain limitations such as secondary effluent generation intermediate production high operational cost low removal efficiency which makes them inefficient for their application in in situ remediation of alachlor 145 162 alachlor degradation in the environment is majorly a microbial process 163 application of microbial strain for the remediation of alachlor from the environment had been studied since long 164 in previous studies several microorganisms have been reported for their alachlor degrading potentiality tiedje and hagedorn reported the biodegradation of alachlor and the intermediate degradation pathway by the soil fungal strain chaltomium globosum 165 the intermediate metabolites described in the study were 2 6 diethyl n methoxymethyl aniline 2 chloro 2 6 diethylacetanilide l chloroacetyl 2 3 dihydro 7 ethylindole and 2 6 diethylaniline they have also reported that the microbe is capable of degrading the intermediates 2 chloro 2 6 diethylacetanilide and 2 6 diethylaniline further into non toxic end products ferrey et al have reported three white rot fungi ceriporiopsis subvermispora phlebia tremellosa and phanerochaete chrysosporium having the capability of mineralizing alachlor 166 however the strains c subvermispora and p tremellosa demonstrated better degradation efficiency than p chrysosporium the actinomycetes displays a wide array of metabolic diversity and hence are actively involved in the degradation of several xenobiotic compounds in the environment 167 the soil actinomycetes streptomyces ps1 5 was reported to have the potential to degraded alachlor in both aqueous as well as soil medium 168 however it uses either chitin or glucose as the primary carbon source and ammonium sulfate or casamino acids as the source of nitrogen similar results have been reported by sette et al where the streptomyces strains isolated through selective enrichment technique were able to tolerate up to 720 mg l of alachlor and are able to degrade up to 72 mg l of alachlor completely in the mineral salt medium 169 previously several bacterial strains such as bacillus cruciviae bacillus brevis pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida have been reported to tolerate and degrade alachlor 170 nevertheless the degradation efficiency of the subjected bacterial strains were significantly low however recent studies revealed that the bacterial strain paracoccus sp strain fly 8 isolated from the contaminated soil has the ability to utilize alachlor efficiently as the sole source of carbon and energy 120 the study focuses on the influence of molecular structure of the contaminant on the rate of biodegradation by the microbial strain it is inferred that the biodegradation efficiency reduces significantly if the alkoxymethyl side chain is substituted with alkoxyethyl side chain similarly the length of the alkoxymethyl of the amide group significantly varies the degradation efficiency of the microbial strain although several microorganisms have been reported no single or mixed culture is able to degrade alachlor efficiently and completely most of the studies pertaining to the biodegradation of alachlor reports that alachlor can only be mineralized through co metabolism 56 171 the earliest study to be reported on the biodegradation of alachlor via cometabolism was on the fungal strain rhizoctonia solani which was reported to co metabolize alachlor in presence of another primary carbon source glucose 172 additional carbon sources such as glucose or sucrose increases the alachlor mineralizing ability of the microbial strains 34 this infers that the microbes utilizes alachlor side chain as the secondary carbon source without attacking the aromatic ring 173 similar results have been reported for the microscopic fungus paecilomyces marquandii which has the ability to co metabolize alachlor by n acetyl oxidation in presence of another primary carbon source 174 the proteomics and metabolomics data revealed that even though the growth and glucose consumption rates decreases in presence of alachlor the rate of glycolysis and tca cycle increases and novel supplementary materials and reactive oxygen species scavengers were formed proteomic analysis implicates that the overexpression of the enzyme cyanide hydratase in presence of alachlor may be due to the fact that it is the key enzyme involved in alachlor biodegradation process initially it was reported that biodegradation of alachlor in active soil is almost 50 times faster than in the sterilized soil however the alachlor degradation enhances in soil samples which has a history of application of alachlor 175 when the soil is augmented with additional carbon sources such as soybean stubble or ground corn concentration of residual alachlor in the soil sample decreases significantly thus suggesting the stimulation of activity of the indigenous soil microflora resulting in the enhancement of the co metabolic transformation of the alachlor a microbial consortium capable of degrading alachlor along with another pesticide atrazine was isolated from the soil sample of a 100 year old mix old site 176 five bacterial strains comprising the microbial consortium were pseudomonas putida pseudomonas marginalis alcaligenes xylosoxydans subsp xylosoxydans alcaligenes xylosoxydans subsp denitrificans and providencia rustigianii the study reveals that the degradation of alachlor by the microbial consortium starts only after the biotransformation of the atrazine begins thus confirming the fact that biodegradation of alachlor was dependent on the presence of the co contaminant atrazine dehgani et al have studied the effect of additional carbon and nitrogen source on biodegradation of alachlor by the bacterial consortium and evaluating the feasibility of the bio stimulation process in the soil culture 105 highest alachlor removal rate was observed in the presence of glucose and sodium citrate as the additional carbon source and ammonium nitrate as the additional nitrogen sources as compared to the other compounds munoz et al have reported biodegradation of alachlor by the yeast candida xestobii isolated from the luvisol a soil type contaminated with chloroacetanilide herbicides 177 more than 80 of the initial alachlor concentration was degraded by the strain c xestobii within 2 days in presence of yeast extract as the additional carbon sources microbial transformation of alachlor in anaerobic conditions is yet to be explored completely aquifer and sediment samples incubated under anaerobic conditions yielded lower removal rates as compared to its aerobic counterparts 51 similarly modest removal efficiency ranging between 30 60 of the initial alachlor concentration of 100 mg l was observed on incubation of contaminated agricultural soil in anaerobic conditions 178 however better anaerobic losses were being observed in anaerobic sewage sludge digester but only on the addition of sterilized sludge digestor materials thus suggesting the co metabolic activity of the substrates 5 3 butachlor owing to the high stability and persistent nature of the butachlor and the potential threats it possess to the ecosystem 78 179 concern regarding its environmental fate and the efficient remediation have become a subject of great concern in the recent past several studies have reported that involves removal of butachlor from the environment by both biotic as well as abiotic processes table 4 degradation of butachlor in the environment follows the first order kinetics 180 application of laboratory synthesized nanoscale zerovalent iron particles is a potential alternative for the removal of butachlor from the aqueous medium 181 the laboratory synthesized zerovalent iron particles gets oxidized and forms iron oxide which acts as a reductant and dechlorinated butachlor in the aqueous medium the study reports more than 90 degradation of 20 mg l of butachlor and removal of the various intermediate toxic metabolites of butachlor that are usually found in the environment another nanomaterial that has been used for the removal of butachlor form the environment was titanium dioxide nanoparticles 182 the study reported mineralization of butachlor by the immobilized titanium dioxide nanoparticle following a first order degradation kinetics microbial degradation has been proved to be a promising alternative for the redressal of chloroacetanilide class of herbicides from the environment 120 however to the very best of our knowledge a very limited study on biodegradation of butachlor has been reported previously soil fungi fusarium solani and fusarium oxysporum are among the first microbial strains to be reported for their ability to degrade butachlor effectively 183 a plausible degradation pathway involving debutoxymethylation dechlorination dehydrogenation c dealkylation o dealkylation n dealkylation hydroxylation and cyclization producing around 30 32 types of metabolites has been proposed in the study similarly another soil fungus aspergillus niger that has the ability to utilize butachlor as well as other herbicides such as molinate and thiobencarb has been reported by torra reventos et al 184 the study described the utilization of the herbicides by the fungal strain in presence of sucrose as the primary carbon source under optimized growth conditions the strain has degraded 20 mg l of butachlor completely within 7 days under optimum growth conditions bacterial strain stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila js 1 isolated from the herbicide contaminated wheat rhizosphere has previously been reported for its ability to utilize butachlor as the sole carbon source the bacterial strain eliminated butachlor completely within 20 days at a rate constant of 0 17 d 1 from the soil 185 another bacterial strain paracoccus sp has been recurrently reported for its efficacious butachlor degrading ability ni et al identified the strain paracoccus sp y3b 1 from the activated sludge of a wastewater plant to degrade the chloroacetanilide herbicides acetochlor and pretilachlor along with butachlor with a degradation rate of 86 7 69 1 and 65 5 within 3 days 186 similar results have been reiterated in case of paracoccus sp strain fly 8 isolated from rice field soil 120 the study also elucidated the butachlor degradation pathway where butachlor was initially converted into alachlor by partial c dealkylation and then converted to 2 chloro n 2 6 dimethylphenyl acetamide by n dealkylation finally it was transformed into 2 6 diethylaniline which was further converted into aniline and catechol catechol was later oxidized through ortho cleavage pathway similar trends have also been reported in the bacterial strain rhodococcus sp b1 which could degrade 100 mg l butachlor within 5 days 187 the bacterial strain also followed similar butachlor metabolism pathway as described previously and the enzyme responsible for the n dealkylation of the side chain of the butachlor was identified as hydrolase enzyme designated as chlh butachlor been hydrolyzed by the enzyme results in the production of 2 chloro n 2 6 dimethylphenyl acetamide and butoxymethanol which could be utilized as the carbon source for the growth owing to the diverseness among butachlor degrading strains the butachlor degradation pathway in different microbial strains are diverse a different butachlor metabolic pathway based on the intermediate metabolite identification has been proposed in the novel strain catellibacterium caeni dca 1 t 136 as per the gc ms analysis five metabolites viz n hydroxymethyl 2 chloro n 2 6 diethylphenyl acetamide 2 chloro n 2 6 diethyl phenyl acetamide 2 6 diethyl phenyl ethoxymethyl carbamic acid n 2 6 diethyl phenyl n hydroxymethyl acetamide and n 2 6 diethyl phenyl n hydroxymethyl formamide were found to be produced during butachlor degradation by the strain dca 1 t moreover bioaugmentation of the bacterial strain in three different soils resulted in 57 2 90 4 removal of 50 mg kg butachlor in 5 days kim et al have reported the syntrophic degradation of butachlor by the bacterial strains mycobacterium sp j7a and sphingobium sp j7b isolated from rice cultivated soil 188 while the pair was capable of rapid degradation of 100 mg l of butachlor within 24 h they were unable to degrade butachlor completely when subjected individually the study demonstrated that the strain j7a transformed butachlor into 2 chloro n 2 6 diethylphenyl acetamide while the strain j7b subsequently mineralizes it completely through 2 6 diethylaniline in another study six bacterial and fungi strains isolated from butachlor contaminated agricultural soil were being reported which could utilize butachlor as the sole carbon and energy source 189 results suggested that among the isolated strains trichoderma viride and pseudomonas alcaligenes were found to degrade 50 mg kg of butachlor up to 98 and 75 after 15 and 21 days respectively 6 conclusion application of synthetic herbicides has improved the agricultural yield and productivity in the past decade their intensive utilization has an adverse effect on the environment hence it is highly necessary to work out variety of strategies for the treatment of the contaminated sites the present review has attempted to accumulate the work done till date on the various remediation technologies for the chloroacetanilide herbicides which will present insight to carry forward the work in the future without having any irretrievable effect on the environment but the primary drawback of these studies regarding the remediation of chloroacetanilide herbicides is that most of them are still at the laboratory scale and large scale applications using efficient treatment technology are yet to be explored to design an effective remediation technology additional research needs to be carried out in this field at present out of all the known abiotic and biotic remediation techniques each having its specific set of advantages and disadvantages application of microbial agents for the removal of herbicides from the contaminated ecosystems has emerged as a powerful alternative technology from an environmental and economic point of view however limited studies has been carried out in the direction of a more innovative integrated process approach where both biological as well as the physicochemical treatment technologies were combined to achieve a better removal efficiency similarly from the above discussion it was quite evident that focus of most of the studies have only been limited to the reduction in the concentration of the parent compounds the metabolites and transformation products tps formed during the degradation processes are yet to be explored significant attention should be paid in this direction as intermediates can have more deplorable effects than the parent compounds and little is known about the fate of the intermediate end products to date hence effort should be made in the coming years to achieve complete mineralization of the chloroacetanilide herbicides to avoid the problem arising from the same declarations of interest none funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
14352,the application of the forward osmosis membrane bioreactor fo mbr requires further investigation in the area of process optimization in current study different operational parameters for improving the overall efficiency of fo mbr were studied and optimized in batch and semi continuous experiments the effect of osmotic backwashing cross flow velocity of the feed solution activated sludge and particle size were studied on the fo mbr flux all batch experiments were of 8 h duration comprising 7 h filtration and 1 h osmotic backwash it was found that osmotic backwashing was ineffective for complete flux recovery in a hollow fibre fo mbr due to severity of the fouling caused by the activated sludge feed in active layer facing draw solution mode a slightly better recovery was observed however with a single 60 min backwash as compared to 2 backwash cycles of 30 min each or 3 backwash cycles of 20 min each a cross flow velocity of 0 105 m s proved optimum higher velocities caused a breakdown of flocs and reduced the mean particle size the latter resulting in lower water flux similarly lower cross flow velocities were not able to provide effective membrane scouring resulting in lower water flux the particle size decreased with operational time in the fo mbr it was also established that above the optimum cross flow velocity flux is inversely proportional to the difference between the initial and final particle size of sludge keywords process optimization osmotic backwashing cross flow velocity particle size distribution 1 introduction forward osmosis fo was initially used for desalination 1 2 and is now considered to be promising for use in wastewater treatment in its manifestation as the forward osmosis membrane bioreactor fo mbr 3 5 the fo process when coupled with a membrane bioreactor offers several advantages compared to other membrane technologies these include higher contaminant rejection lower operational hydraulic pressure ease of fouling removal compared to pressure driven systems and less frequent backwashing required 6 8 optimization of the different unit operations and processes is very critical when operating an fo mbr at laboratory scale this helps to completely understand the process and make the necessary design changes before extrapolating the outcomes to commercial scale applications some studies have already reported on the optimization of unit operations and processes for fo systems 9 11 while a few others have specifically reported on fo mbr optimization 4 12 13 these studies focused on i ideal membrane configuration and orientation in the fo mbr ii salinity buildup in the feed tank of the fo mbr iii microbial toxicity effects on the resident sludge in the fo mbr and iv organic phosphate and ammoniacal nitrogen removal in the fo mbr role of aeration intensity and modification of membrane surface on the fo mbr membrane fouling is also reported in some studies 14 15 however there remain some key areas which demand critical investigation to establish fo mbr as a viable option for wastewater treatment one important parameter to be optimized is osmotic backwashing in pressure driven membrane processes a normal hydraulic backwashing is applied but in the fo mbr osmotic backwashing may be used to restore flux during osmotic backwashing the draw solution ds is replaced with a liquid having a lower osmotic pressure compared to the feed solution e g distilled water thus the flow starts from the draw solution side to the feed solution side this reverse flow causes scouring and or removal of foulants on the active layer surface it has been reported that osmotic backwashing can restore 90 of the initial flux 16 17 however these studies are specific to certain types of membrane and further research in this area is required another critical parameter in optimizing the flux of fo processes is cross flow velocity cfv it has been reported by various researchers that an increase in cross flow velocity of either the draw or feed solutions results in an increase of the flux due to both a potential scouring effect and a reduction in the concentration polarization cp 18 19 however there are very few studies which have been able to establish a link between the cross flow velocity of the sludge feed solution and the flux in the fo mbr 20 and in particular linking cross flow velocity with extracellular polymeric substances eps eps are natural polymers of high molecular weight which are secreted by microorganisms into their environment 21 epss establish the functional and structural integrity of biofilms these compounds are important in biofilm formation and the attachment of cells to surfaces 22 eps plays a vital role in the biofouling of membrane bioreactors mbrs but its role in fo mbr membrane fouling is not yet clearly defined 23 24 the particle size distribution psd of the activated sludge particles is an important parameter that needs to be controlled for a stable reactor operation several design and operational parameters such as mixing shear force organic loading rate aeration and solid retention time srt may affect the particle size distribution of the activated sludge inside a reactor 25 the impact of sludge particle size on fo mbr operation may be critical and in particular its contribution towards concentration polarization understanding of the dynamics of fo membrane fouling is critical for the effective operation of the fo mbr some studies have been reported on these issues but there is a need for further exploration 26 based on all the above observations some critical areas for progress in fo mbr operation are investigated in this study which have not been given full attention until now these include four in particular i the effectiveness of osmotic backwashing for hollow fiber membranes ii cross flow velocity optimization for the activated sludge feed solution in the fo mbr particularly in relation to eps iii the effect of particle size distribution on flux in the fo mbr and iv the dynamics of fo hollow fiber membrane fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 fo membranes used two types of membranes were used in this study the first one was a flat sheet membrane made with a cellulose tri acetate cta active layer and an embedded polyester mesh for support sourced from hydration technology incubation hti usa the use of these flat sheet membranes in fo applications has already been reported 27 28 the effective area of flat sheet membrane was 47 25 cm2 10 30 cm 4 58 cm the second membrane used was a hollow fibre membrane molded into an operation module with two inlets and two outlets which was prepared in house at the singapore membrane technology centre smtc the membrane is constructed with an ultra thin polyamide based ro like skin layer 300 600 nm on the inner surface of a porous hollow fiber substrate the detailed characterization of the membrane has already been reported 29 the effective outer skin area of the hollow fibers was 174 cm2 the water permeability coefficient a and the solute permeability coefficient b are two very important parameters to assess the quality of a membrane values of a and b for the hti flat sheet fo membranes are 0 81 l m2h bar 2 2 10 12 m s pa and 0 62 l m2h 1 7 10 7 m s respectively for smtc hollow fiber fo membrane the a and b are 2 22 l m2h bar 5 94 10 12 m s pa and 0 2 l m2h 0 54 10 7 m s respectively all the chemicals used in this study were of laboratory grade and purchased from sigma aldrich the chemicals were used as obtained without any purification or alteration in their structures unless otherwise mentioned all solutions were prepared in de ionized di water 2 2 experimental setup and procedures fig 1 a b shows schematic diagrams of the batch and semi continuous experimental setups for fo mbr the semi continuous setup was identical in configuration to the batch setup except for the additional peristaltic pump which was controlled with a timer to inject concentrated draw solution into the draw tank at specific time intervals this latter was done to maintain a fairly constant osmotic pressure in the draw solution for the fo mbr experiments a synthetic wastewater feed solution control tank was used in combination with a solenoid valve a relay unit and a water level sensor as the level of feed solution dropped due to its transfer to the draw solution the same volume of fresh feed solution was automatically added to the feed solution tank to bring it back to the starting volume the composition of synthetic wastewater is specified in table 1 the sludge used in the study was sourced from membrane bioreactor mbr plant at national university of sciences and technology nust pakistan synthetic wastewater was used directly as a feed solution the composition of synthetic wastewater is specified in table 1 the quantities of the different chemicals were employed to make a synthetic cod of 500 mg l and a cod n p ratio of 100 10 2 to maintain an adequate level of nutrients in the wastewater for microbial growth 2 3 analytical methods the osmotic pressure of the draw solutions was measured using an osmometer micro osmometer 13 13dr roebling germany the instrument measures the osmolality based on the freezing point depression of the solution distilled water which has zero osmotic pressure was used for calibration the osmolality of the solution was converted to osmotic pressure using the morse equation eq 1 1 π i m r t i n v r t where π osmotic pressure atm or bar i van t hoff factor m molarity of solution moles liter r universal gas constant l atm mol k or l bar mol k t temperature kelvin sludge particle size distribution was analyzed through a particle size analyzer which is based on the laser scattering principle la 920 horiba japan the results were reported in percentage of particle size volume total organic carbon toc was analyzed by the high temperature combustion method using a toc tn analyzer analytic jena multi n c 3100 germany the eps were also measured in the sludge samples soluble eps was separated from the total eps through sludge centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was analyzed bound eps was separated by the cation exchange resin method 30 the carbohydrate and protein portions of both types of eps were measured through the phenol sulfuric acid method 31 and the lowry method 32 2 4 osmotic backwashing experiments osmotic backwashing was performed on the hollow fiber fo mbr batch setup by replacing the 2 m nacl draw solution with di water however the feed solution remained the same i e mixed activated sludge with a mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of 6000 mg l before changing the draw solution to di water the module and piping were flushed with di water for 2 min to avoid contamination from the nacl solution present in the piping or module the normal operation of the fo system was referred to as filtration and the reverse operation as backwash all experiments were of 8 h duration comprising 7 h of filtration and 1 h of backwash experiments were conducted in batch mode and after each experiment the membrane was chemically cleaned 2 5 cross flow velocity experiments for the flat sheet fo mbr three different cross flow velocities i e 0 035 0 105 and 0 245 m s were studied in semi continuous experiments the draw solution concentration was 2 m nacl and the draw tank volume was 1 l for all experiments the concentration of the added concentrated draw solution was 5 m nacl and the membrane orientation was al ds for all experiments the feed solution was activated sludge with an mlss concentration of 6000 mg l and a volume of 2 5 l all experiments were carried out for 48 h fresh sludge sourced from mbr was used for each experiment to nullify the effects of draw solution dilution on the net flux experiments were conducted in the semi continuous mode by constantly adding the concentrated draw solution the starting mlss concentration was maintained at 6000 mg l because this value is within the recommended concentration range for mbr and also because it was used successfully in previous reported studies for fo mbr 3 the final flux was calculated from weight measurements which were then adjusted by excluding the weight of concentrated draw solution added it was observed that the hollow fiber module was not stable above 0 14 m s cross flow velocity due to turbulence hence it was not considered for this study 2 6 fo membrane fouling dynamics studies experiments were conducted in batch mode with 2 m nacl as a draw solution of 0 5 l initial volume and synthetic wastewater as feed solution of 0 5 l initial volume conductivity toc and the volume of water extracted were measured hourly hollow fiber membrane was used for the study 3 results and discussion 3 1 osmotic backwashing optimization table 2 summarizes the results of osmotic backwashing experiments in this study it was expected that during osmotic backwash the di water would start flowing back into the mixed sludge and it would displace the fouling layer caused by the accumulation of sludge particles from the membrane surface due to practical limitations of the hollow fiber membrane used the active layer facing draw solution al ds configuration was used with the al on the inside of the lumen which is more prone to icp associated with the mixed sludge liquor on the outside of the lumen support layer as compared to the active layer facing feed solution al fs configuration however this is also a more practical approach because of the very fine internal diameter of hollow fibers it is not advisable to circulate the sludge inside the fibres in an al fs configuration due to potential choking hence the sludge needs to be circulated on the external side of the hollow fibers the 2 m nacl draw solution used in this study has an osmotic pressure of 96 bars and the feed solution a mixed sludge liquor has an osmotic pressure around 1 2 bars as calculated with the morse equation eq 1 looking at the sum of filtrate volumes extracted in table 2 it may be inferred that the osmotic backwashing for smaller repetitive cycles of 30 and 20 min was ineffective compared to the one single backwash of 60 min this was mainly due to negative i e in the forward direction water flux caused by the gradient inside the fo membrane already established by 2 m nacl during filtration this gradient was so strong that even rinsing the system with di water before backwashing could not remove its effect completely also the mixed sludge did not have a high enough osmotic pressure to adequately establish its own osmotic gradient in the membrane so it may be inferred that osmotic backwashing with sludge is not practical for a hollow fiber fo mbr in al ds configuration nevertheless osmotic backwashing with a long single cycle is relatively more effective when compared to backwashing with shorter repeated cycles it is worth noting that the osmotic backwash approach adopted in this study is more realistic and practical in fo mbr as compared to previous studies that used di water in replacement of the draw solution and some weak brine solution in replacement of the feed solution 3 some other studies also used only model foulants and not a real mixed sludge 16 it is logical to assume that a mixed activated sludge is a more complex foulant compared to idealized model foulants hence the results of this study are more reliable for the practical operation of an fo mbr 3 2 cross flow velocity optimization it is generally observed that an increase in cross flow velocity causes a better membrane scouring and hence the flux is increased a linear relationship exists between flux and cross flow velocity up to a certain limit however after eliminating the ecp completely an increase in cross flow is not effective in increasing the net flux conductivity was maintained constant in the otherwise gradually diluted draw solution by the addition of concentrated draw solution during the different fo mbr runs as per procedures described in section 2 5 this ensured a near constant osmotic pressure in the draw solution table 3 summarizes the eps values before the start of and at the end of each 48 h experiment since the experiments were conducted in al ds configuration it was expected that there would be a strong fouling due to the release of eps it was assumed that by increasing the cross flow velocity of the feed sludge an increase in shear stress on the microbial flocs will occur which can reduce their size this might encourage a higher eps release which ultimately may decrease the flux through severe cp looking now at tables 3 and 4 it may be observed that the eps always increased during each experiment and the mean particle size always decreased so increase in cross flow velocity is inversely proportional to particle size inside the fo mbr and it is likely a straight line relationship thus our first assumption that higher cross flow velocity can generate higher shear force to break the particles to smaller size was correct it may also be inferred that the reduction in mean particle size is related to initial particle size with higher initial sizes the reduction was correspondingly higher and the difference was greater table 3 depicts that the relationship between cross flow velocity and eps is not linear so our assumption that decrease in particle size may cause a corresponding higher release of eps is not correct similarly table 4 shows that the relationship between reduction in mean particle size and flux volume extracted was not proportional however it may be safely claimed that an increase in velocity reduces the mean particle size which in turn will affect the flux negatively potentially due to the deposition of cell debris as cake layer over the membrane surface hence a cfv of velocity of 0 105 m s is recommended in our study below this the shear is inadequate for scouring of the surface and above it the particles start to break down significantly causing the flux reduction 3 3 dynamics of hollow fibre fo membrane fouling direct filtration of synthetic wastewater table 1 composition through an fo membrane was investigated in order to understand the dynamics of membrane fouling direct sludge was not used as it involves many living organisms and this complexity makes analysis much more difficult and ambiguous in table 5 the actual values are the in situ experimentally measured values and the calculated values are the original values before the experiment began but adjusted with respect to the water volume added in the draw solution or the water volume subtracted from the feed solution this then allows a meaningful comparison with the actual values in the first hour almost 34 mg l of toc was transferred to the draw solution the constant values of toc for both feed and draw solutions from the 2nd to the 6th hour shows that a maximum amount of toc was transferred in the first hour and thereafter the toc did not pass through the fo membrane it may be claimed that the membrane initially allowed the organics to pass through it and then due to the combined effects of cp and pore clogging the rest of the organics were trapped by the membrane almost 88 mg l toc escaped from the feed solution results of 6th hour actual and calculated feed toc to the draw solution during the whole experiment there was however only an increase of 34 mg l in the toc of the draw solution and the remaining 54 mg l toc might have been trapped by the fo membrane and given rise to the concentration polarization a passage of 3 mg l of toc to the draw solution during fo mbr operation was also observed in another study 3 these observations lead to two important conclusions i if we use an fo mbr process instead of fo filtration alone the amount of toc that leaks to the draw solution can be substantially reduced as a result of the biodegradation by the sludge and ii passage of toc towards the draw solution in the first hour is inevitable at this stage of the fo process and both membrane manufacturers and process developers should give serious attention to this issue the conductivity results in table 5 revealed that almost 1 11 ms cm conductivity was added to the feed solution during the experiment possibly due to the reverse solute transport again the maximum reverse transport occurred in the first hour it shows that the conductivity increase in fo mbr may be controlled easily and it may not affect the processes on the feed side the critical nature of the first hour in fo mbr fouling and the steady state achievement is also reported by other researchers 18 supporting these findings on the fouling behavior of the fo mbr feed tank membrane during the first hour 4 conclusions this study has investigated three significant areas in the optimization of fo mbr operation which have not been properly addressed before now firstly osmotic backwashing was found not to be very effective in obtaining flux recovery for the hollow fiber fo mbr nevertheless it is concluded that a backwashing cycle of higher time is more productive in restoring flux as compared to smaller frequent backwash cycles secondly an optimum cross flow velocity in this case of 0 105 m s existed such that lower velocities were ineffective whilst higher velocities caused a breakdown of flocs which in turn caused a reduction in mean particle size and an acceleration of ultimate flux decline it was difficult to establish a causal relationship between eps and cross flow velocity however it was revealed that eps always increased during the course of all experiments thirdly a major transport of organic contaminants and draw solute occurred across the fo membrane within the first hour of operation of the fo mbr the water quality of the permeate should be monitored accordingly

14352,the application of the forward osmosis membrane bioreactor fo mbr requires further investigation in the area of process optimization in current study different operational parameters for improving the overall efficiency of fo mbr were studied and optimized in batch and semi continuous experiments the effect of osmotic backwashing cross flow velocity of the feed solution activated sludge and particle size were studied on the fo mbr flux all batch experiments were of 8 h duration comprising 7 h filtration and 1 h osmotic backwash it was found that osmotic backwashing was ineffective for complete flux recovery in a hollow fibre fo mbr due to severity of the fouling caused by the activated sludge feed in active layer facing draw solution mode a slightly better recovery was observed however with a single 60 min backwash as compared to 2 backwash cycles of 30 min each or 3 backwash cycles of 20 min each a cross flow velocity of 0 105 m s proved optimum higher velocities caused a breakdown of flocs and reduced the mean particle size the latter resulting in lower water flux similarly lower cross flow velocities were not able to provide effective membrane scouring resulting in lower water flux the particle size decreased with operational time in the fo mbr it was also established that above the optimum cross flow velocity flux is inversely proportional to the difference between the initial and final particle size of sludge keywords process optimization osmotic backwashing cross flow velocity particle size distribution 1 introduction forward osmosis fo was initially used for desalination 1 2 and is now considered to be promising for use in wastewater treatment in its manifestation as the forward osmosis membrane bioreactor fo mbr 3 5 the fo process when coupled with a membrane bioreactor offers several advantages compared to other membrane technologies these include higher contaminant rejection lower operational hydraulic pressure ease of fouling removal compared to pressure driven systems and less frequent backwashing required 6 8 optimization of the different unit operations and processes is very critical when operating an fo mbr at laboratory scale this helps to completely understand the process and make the necessary design changes before extrapolating the outcomes to commercial scale applications some studies have already reported on the optimization of unit operations and processes for fo systems 9 11 while a few others have specifically reported on fo mbr optimization 4 12 13 these studies focused on i ideal membrane configuration and orientation in the fo mbr ii salinity buildup in the feed tank of the fo mbr iii microbial toxicity effects on the resident sludge in the fo mbr and iv organic phosphate and ammoniacal nitrogen removal in the fo mbr role of aeration intensity and modification of membrane surface on the fo mbr membrane fouling is also reported in some studies 14 15 however there remain some key areas which demand critical investigation to establish fo mbr as a viable option for wastewater treatment one important parameter to be optimized is osmotic backwashing in pressure driven membrane processes a normal hydraulic backwashing is applied but in the fo mbr osmotic backwashing may be used to restore flux during osmotic backwashing the draw solution ds is replaced with a liquid having a lower osmotic pressure compared to the feed solution e g distilled water thus the flow starts from the draw solution side to the feed solution side this reverse flow causes scouring and or removal of foulants on the active layer surface it has been reported that osmotic backwashing can restore 90 of the initial flux 16 17 however these studies are specific to certain types of membrane and further research in this area is required another critical parameter in optimizing the flux of fo processes is cross flow velocity cfv it has been reported by various researchers that an increase in cross flow velocity of either the draw or feed solutions results in an increase of the flux due to both a potential scouring effect and a reduction in the concentration polarization cp 18 19 however there are very few studies which have been able to establish a link between the cross flow velocity of the sludge feed solution and the flux in the fo mbr 20 and in particular linking cross flow velocity with extracellular polymeric substances eps eps are natural polymers of high molecular weight which are secreted by microorganisms into their environment 21 epss establish the functional and structural integrity of biofilms these compounds are important in biofilm formation and the attachment of cells to surfaces 22 eps plays a vital role in the biofouling of membrane bioreactors mbrs but its role in fo mbr membrane fouling is not yet clearly defined 23 24 the particle size distribution psd of the activated sludge particles is an important parameter that needs to be controlled for a stable reactor operation several design and operational parameters such as mixing shear force organic loading rate aeration and solid retention time srt may affect the particle size distribution of the activated sludge inside a reactor 25 the impact of sludge particle size on fo mbr operation may be critical and in particular its contribution towards concentration polarization understanding of the dynamics of fo membrane fouling is critical for the effective operation of the fo mbr some studies have been reported on these issues but there is a need for further exploration 26 based on all the above observations some critical areas for progress in fo mbr operation are investigated in this study which have not been given full attention until now these include four in particular i the effectiveness of osmotic backwashing for hollow fiber membranes ii cross flow velocity optimization for the activated sludge feed solution in the fo mbr particularly in relation to eps iii the effect of particle size distribution on flux in the fo mbr and iv the dynamics of fo hollow fiber membrane fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 fo membranes used two types of membranes were used in this study the first one was a flat sheet membrane made with a cellulose tri acetate cta active layer and an embedded polyester mesh for support sourced from hydration technology incubation hti usa the use of these flat sheet membranes in fo applications has already been reported 27 28 the effective area of flat sheet membrane was 47 25 cm2 10 30 cm 4 58 cm the second membrane used was a hollow fibre membrane molded into an operation module with two inlets and two outlets which was prepared in house at the singapore membrane technology centre smtc the membrane is constructed with an ultra thin polyamide based ro like skin layer 300 600 nm on the inner surface of a porous hollow fiber substrate the detailed characterization of the membrane has already been reported 29 the effective outer skin area of the hollow fibers was 174 cm2 the water permeability coefficient a and the solute permeability coefficient b are two very important parameters to assess the quality of a membrane values of a and b for the hti flat sheet fo membranes are 0 81 l m2h bar 2 2 10 12 m s pa and 0 62 l m2h 1 7 10 7 m s respectively for smtc hollow fiber fo membrane the a and b are 2 22 l m2h bar 5 94 10 12 m s pa and 0 2 l m2h 0 54 10 7 m s respectively all the chemicals used in this study were of laboratory grade and purchased from sigma aldrich the chemicals were used as obtained without any purification or alteration in their structures unless otherwise mentioned all solutions were prepared in de ionized di water 2 2 experimental setup and procedures fig 1 a b shows schematic diagrams of the batch and semi continuous experimental setups for fo mbr the semi continuous setup was identical in configuration to the batch setup except for the additional peristaltic pump which was controlled with a timer to inject concentrated draw solution into the draw tank at specific time intervals this latter was done to maintain a fairly constant osmotic pressure in the draw solution for the fo mbr experiments a synthetic wastewater feed solution control tank was used in combination with a solenoid valve a relay unit and a water level sensor as the level of feed solution dropped due to its transfer to the draw solution the same volume of fresh feed solution was automatically added to the feed solution tank to bring it back to the starting volume the composition of synthetic wastewater is specified in table 1 the sludge used in the study was sourced from membrane bioreactor mbr plant at national university of sciences and technology nust pakistan synthetic wastewater was used directly as a feed solution the composition of synthetic wastewater is specified in table 1 the quantities of the different chemicals were employed to make a synthetic cod of 500 mg l and a cod n p ratio of 100 10 2 to maintain an adequate level of nutrients in the wastewater for microbial growth 2 3 analytical methods the osmotic pressure of the draw solutions was measured using an osmometer micro osmometer 13 13dr roebling germany the instrument measures the osmolality based on the freezing point depression of the solution distilled water which has zero osmotic pressure was used for calibration the osmolality of the solution was converted to osmotic pressure using the morse equation eq 1 1 π i m r t i n v r t where π osmotic pressure atm or bar i van t hoff factor m molarity of solution moles liter r universal gas constant l atm mol k or l bar mol k t temperature kelvin sludge particle size distribution was analyzed through a particle size analyzer which is based on the laser scattering principle la 920 horiba japan the results were reported in percentage of particle size volume total organic carbon toc was analyzed by the high temperature combustion method using a toc tn analyzer analytic jena multi n c 3100 germany the eps were also measured in the sludge samples soluble eps was separated from the total eps through sludge centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was analyzed bound eps was separated by the cation exchange resin method 30 the carbohydrate and protein portions of both types of eps were measured through the phenol sulfuric acid method 31 and the lowry method 32 2 4 osmotic backwashing experiments osmotic backwashing was performed on the hollow fiber fo mbr batch setup by replacing the 2 m nacl draw solution with di water however the feed solution remained the same i e mixed activated sludge with a mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of 6000 mg l before changing the draw solution to di water the module and piping were flushed with di water for 2 min to avoid contamination from the nacl solution present in the piping or module the normal operation of the fo system was referred to as filtration and the reverse operation as backwash all experiments were of 8 h duration comprising 7 h of filtration and 1 h of backwash experiments were conducted in batch mode and after each experiment the membrane was chemically cleaned 2 5 cross flow velocity experiments for the flat sheet fo mbr three different cross flow velocities i e 0 035 0 105 and 0 245 m s were studied in semi continuous experiments the draw solution concentration was 2 m nacl and the draw tank volume was 1 l for all experiments the concentration of the added concentrated draw solution was 5 m nacl and the membrane orientation was al ds for all experiments the feed solution was activated sludge with an mlss concentration of 6000 mg l and a volume of 2 5 l all experiments were carried out for 48 h fresh sludge sourced from mbr was used for each experiment to nullify the effects of draw solution dilution on the net flux experiments were conducted in the semi continuous mode by constantly adding the concentrated draw solution the starting mlss concentration was maintained at 6000 mg l because this value is within the recommended concentration range for mbr and also because it was used successfully in previous reported studies for fo mbr 3 the final flux was calculated from weight measurements which were then adjusted by excluding the weight of concentrated draw solution added it was observed that the hollow fiber module was not stable above 0 14 m s cross flow velocity due to turbulence hence it was not considered for this study 2 6 fo membrane fouling dynamics studies experiments were conducted in batch mode with 2 m nacl as a draw solution of 0 5 l initial volume and synthetic wastewater as feed solution of 0 5 l initial volume conductivity toc and the volume of water extracted were measured hourly hollow fiber membrane was used for the study 3 results and discussion 3 1 osmotic backwashing optimization table 2 summarizes the results of osmotic backwashing experiments in this study it was expected that during osmotic backwash the di water would start flowing back into the mixed sludge and it would displace the fouling layer caused by the accumulation of sludge particles from the membrane surface due to practical limitations of the hollow fiber membrane used the active layer facing draw solution al ds configuration was used with the al on the inside of the lumen which is more prone to icp associated with the mixed sludge liquor on the outside of the lumen support layer as compared to the active layer facing feed solution al fs configuration however this is also a more practical approach because of the very fine internal diameter of hollow fibers it is not advisable to circulate the sludge inside the fibres in an al fs configuration due to potential choking hence the sludge needs to be circulated on the external side of the hollow fibers the 2 m nacl draw solution used in this study has an osmotic pressure of 96 bars and the feed solution a mixed sludge liquor has an osmotic pressure around 1 2 bars as calculated with the morse equation eq 1 looking at the sum of filtrate volumes extracted in table 2 it may be inferred that the osmotic backwashing for smaller repetitive cycles of 30 and 20 min was ineffective compared to the one single backwash of 60 min this was mainly due to negative i e in the forward direction water flux caused by the gradient inside the fo membrane already established by 2 m nacl during filtration this gradient was so strong that even rinsing the system with di water before backwashing could not

14353,refinery wastewater contains light fractions of aliphatic and aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons such as phenol which demands removal to acceptable levels before being discharged into water bodies literature based screening of various metal oxide catalysts for phenol degradation indicated oxides of titanium and zinc to be the most effective catalysts tio2 activated carbon ac and zno ac catalysts were synthesized via hydrothermal methods and tested for phenol degradation physicochemical characterization of the synthesized catalyst revealed evenly distributed nano sized titanium dioxide and well crystalized zno structure on the carbon surface while the composite synthesis process reduced the overall bet surface area of both zno ac and tio2 ac it retained the major surface functional groups of ac with addition to metal oxides in the porous complex synthesized zno ac and tio2 ac showed improved phenol degradation efficiency than pure activated carbon under uv light illumination effect of various process parameters such as illumination duration catalyst dosage and initial concentration of phenol were assessed to identify optimal conditions for maximum degradation further kinetic data were generated and the results were validated using reaction models to evaluate the degradation mechanism at lower concentrations the kinetic parameters matched well with the first order reaction model while at higher concentrations it followed second order kinetics owing to the shift in the mechanism of adsorption the relatively enhanced phenol degradation efficiency by zno ac over tio2 ac composite could be attributed to the synergetic effect of adsorption and photocatalytic degradation keywords phenol degradation photocatalytic oxidation tio2 ac zno ac uv light 1 introduction refineries produce huge volumes of wastewater that is approximately 0 4 1 6 times of the processed oil during crude oil processing 1 2 refinery wastewater contains light fractions of aliphatic and aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons such as phenol which poses severe hse issues if not treated properly 3 us environmental protection agency usepa regulations for discharging waste water into oceans suggest concentrations to be below 1 ppm of phenol 4 while the uae government standards are more restrictive in the range of 0 1 ppm of phenol 5 typical concentrations of phenolic compounds in untreated refinery wastewater were found to be in the range of 11 to 14 ppm 2 it is therefore essential to develop an efficient economical and environmentally friendly treatment process that will remove phenol from wastewater to desired levels phenol is known to be a recalcitrant compound due to its toxicity and non biodegradable properties and thus has received serious attention for safer processing and handling phenol treatment technologies in wastewater can be categorized into two parts separation techniques and destructive techniques 6 separation technique is a non destructive technique that allows for recovery of phenol via steam distillation extraction adsorption membrane pervaporation and membrane based solvent extraction destructive techniques on the other hand includes electrochemical oxidation photocatalytic oxidation chemical oxidation and biochemical abatement among various techniques adsorption has received widespread attention because of its non destructive nature and effectiveness and there has been numerous on going research in finding effective adsorbents to treat phenolic wastewater 7 activated carbon is one of the most popular adsorbents for the treatment of organic compounds in wastewater including phenol the major constituent of activated carbon is carbon and other hetero atoms such as hydrogen nitrogen oxygen and sulfur accounting for more than 95 by weight 7 the key features of activated carbon are high porosity large surface area unique adsorptive and reusable properties through regeneration which makes activated carbon an attractive adsorbent 8 10 there are two types of activated carbon depending on the shape of material granular activated carbon gac and powdered activated carbon pac activated carbon needs to undergo regeneration to restore adsorption efficiency however the process remains expensive and causes loss of adsorbents 11 several options were attempted to improve the functionality and life time of activated carbon system including chemical modification impregnation with nanoparticles alternate carbon precursors and modified activation methods among them impregnation on activated carbon has been a promising technique for complete destruction of phenol to other relatively safer molecules many recent studies have focused on identifying effective catalyst to maximize the removal efficiency metals metal oxide impregnated porous matrix are common in catalyst development owing to effectiveness the porous structure of the activated carbon can be widely varied depending upon the host molecule that needs to be embedded there has been minimal attention on metal oxide embedded porous systems despite the large surface area offered by the porous matrix catalyst screening was performed with the following criteria in consideration of its applicability to refinery wastewater first the catalyst should show good performance in effluent discharging conditions the regulation limit of discharged petroleum wastewater is in the range of temperature 22 41 c and a ph of 6 2 10 6 12 some catalysts however require higher temperature or lower ph to maximize the reaction in such cases it is likely to result in incomplete reaction when they are used in tertiary wastewater treatment processes secondly the catalyst should have been widely researched and tested for similar applications the catalyst is usually immersed in large volume of wastewater and is easily deactivated by impurities in the process the availability of information such as surface mechanism can allow us to predict the side reaction and corrosion so as to identify the optimal operating condition not clear lastly the catalyst should be cost effective and environment friendly with the stated advantages an effective metal oxide was selected to be embedded on activated carbon for the removal of phenol through thorough literature screening of similar adsorbents metal oxide catalysts including titanium oxide tio2 aluminum oxide al2o3 copper oxide cuo zinc oxide zno and iron oxide fe2o3 were chosen based on the criteria suggested above and were reviewed intensely tio2 and zno seemed to be the most promising catalysts suitable for phenol adsorption titanium oxide tio2 nanoparticles has shown significant phenol degradation in the range of 50 99 as a single metal refer table 3 while zno was found to be in the range of 52 98 depending on the experiment conditions the potential of copper oxide cuo as a phenol degradation catalyst has been mostly focused at high temperature conditions than room temperatures refer table 3 copper leaching was reported to be another issue that had to be taken into consideration fe has been recently studied as fenton reaction ferrous ion fe2 h2o2 or fenton like reaction ferric ion fe3 h2o2 rather than iron oxide form on the other hand there was insufficient information to elaborate the intrinsic efficiency of al2o3 in phenol degradation accordingly the present work would attempt to embed metal oxides in the porous carbon matrix for its application towards degradation of phenolic compounds photocatalytic oxidation using tio2 and zno seems to contribute to the improvement of the reaction rate absorption of photon with higher energy than band gap of photocatalyst initiates the photocatalysis photocatalytic oxidation efficiency of phenol degradation can fluctuate depending on the light source the form and size of crystallinity and catalyst dosage tio2 has received extensive attention because of its high activity desirable physical and chemical properties low cost availability and environmentally friendly feature there are mainly three forms of tio2 including brookite rutile and anatase the ratio between anatase phase and rutile phase however plays a significant role in the degradation according to the comparison study of titanium dioxide varying ratio of anatase and rutile 13 light source is also an important factor where the rate of initiation for photo catalysis especially electron hole formation is strongly dependent on light intensity 14 light intensity distribution within the photocatalytic reactor may play a significant role during the process zno is also a promising photocatalyst with advantage of wide absorption spectrum no risk for human health environment friendly feature similar band gap with tio2 and lower cost than tio2 the fast recombination of photogenerated charges and the formation of zn oh 2 in the water are possible to limit the reaction 15 impregnation in porous carbon matrix eliminates problem of catalyst loss through the formation of emulsion with waste water rendering the catalyst suitable for packed bed operation synergetic effect of activated carbon and photocatalyst for phenol degradation has received less attention from the scientific community the present work aims to identify effective metal oxide doped activated carbon catalysts for phenol degradation and to provide a systematic framework for assessing the effectiveness of activated carbon supported photocatalyst in phenol degradation under tertiary wastewater treatment condition the work would facilitate identification of the most efficient catalyst and the optimal process conditions that would provide the maximum phenol degradation moreover the synergistic effect of activated carbon and photocatalyst would be simultaneously evaluated 2 experimental 2 1 catalyst synthesis to synthesize tio2 ac composite titanium isopropoxide c12h28o4ti 97 sigma aldrich was used as a titanium precursor in ethanol polyethylene glycol peg was added to enhance the colloidal stability and to lead well distributed titanium dioxide on carbon surface thus preventing aggregation and sedimentation 16 the solution was sonicated for 30 min to attain complete dissolution commercial activated carbon nuchar sa 20 was dispersed in ethanol as a second solution activated carbon solution was added to the precursor solution and again sonicated for two hours to ensure impregnation of catalyst inside the carbon matrix the mixture was maintained at 70 c for several hours finally the solution was washed with deionized water several times filtered and dried overnight in the oven at 80 c for zno ac composite synthesis zinc acetate dehydrate zn ch3coo 2 2h2o was chosen as a precursor and hexamethylenetetramine hmta c6h12n4 sigma aldrich as a surfactant to control nucleation and to modify the morphology of zno rod structure zinc acetate and hmta solutions are mixed and the ph of the solution was adjusted to 8 by adding naoh solution and diluted to 100 ml with deionized water activated carbon sa20 was added to the solution following which the solution was kept in ultrasonic bath for 30 min the mixture was placed on a hot plate with intense agitation at 70 c and maintained overnight the synthesized zno ac composite was filtered rinsed with deionized water and dried in the oven at 80 c overnight 2 2 catalyst characterization

detector with kbr window and kbr beam splitter was employed to identify interaction direction of chemical bonds on the catalyst surface pressed pellet technique was applied to get higher resolution and infrared acquisitions between 4000 cm 1 and 400 cm 1 were collected with the software opus to identify phases present in the catalyst and to estimate particle sizes x ray diffraction xrd spectra was obtained using a panalytical x pert pro powder diffractometer the samples were mounted on a zero background holder and scanned using cu kα radiation λ 0 15405 nm with the conditions of an applied voltage of 40 kv intensity of 40 ma angular range 2θ 10 80 and 0 02 steps s with a dwell time δt 1 5 s crystallite sizes were calculated using scherrer equation d kλ wcos θ 17 the surface area and pore size were measured by bet surface analysis with micromeritics 3 flex analyzer under nitrogen purging condition samples were pretreated under degassing at 150 c for 3 h to remove any adsorbed species 2 3 phenol degradation study degradation of phenol was carried out using the synthesized tio2 ac and zno ac composite under uv irradiation as a batch experiment each phenol solution with specific concentration was diluted from stock solution the chosen catalyst was suspended in 300 ml of phenol solution in a triangular flask in which an 8 1 w uv lamp was inserted as an uv source the lamp was kept in a quartz tube and immersed completely into the solution the mixture was stirred vigorously at 400 rpm to exclude mass transfer limitations from liquid to solid phase during the reaction the temperature of the solution was kept 32 c 3 by heat irradiation from uv lamp and the experiments were continued for 240 min 3 ml samples were withdrawn by the syringe at regular time intervals time and filtered using a 0 45 μm millipore filters degradation study with activated carbon sa 20 nuchar commercial tio2 p25 and zno catalyst were also conducted under uv irradiation to serve as a reference for photocatalytic degradation 0 2 μm nylon millipore filters were specially used to deal with nano sized particles of commercial tio2 and zno catalysts with selected catalyst that showed better degradation efficiency kinetic studies were carried out varying the catalyst dosage from 0 1 g l to 1 g l and initial concentration of phenol from 10 ppm to 100 ppm the degradation efficiency of phenol was determined through the following equation 1 d e g r a d a t i o n p e r c e n t a g e 100 c 0 c t c 0 where c0 is the initial concentration of phenol and ct is the concentration of phenol after time t min schematic diagram for photocatalytic reactor setup is shown in fig 1 collected samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc with acquity uplc h class system from waters company 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization bet analysis was performed on the synthesized catalysts in order to understand pore network and also to estimate pore size and surface area n2 adsorption desorption isotherms on the two selected catalysts are presented in fig 2 adsorption isotherms indicate a sharp increase in adsorption at lower relative pressures 0 1 beyond which it continues to increase gradually with again a sharp increase at near saturation relative pressure formation of clear hysteresis loop is observed during the desorption isotherm the sharp increase at low partial pressure are attributed to the presence of micropores while the progressive increase at higher relative pressures could be attributed to the presence of mesopores 18 the sharp increase in adsorption near the saturation relative pressure could be attributed to the condensation of nitrogen in the porous matrix all the adsorption isotherms could be categorized as a type iv standard adsorption isotherm 19 which characterizes materials possessing mixed proportions of micro and mesopores the formation of hysteresis loop as well confirms pores of these nature and the pores possibly being a network of mixed pores with the majority of it typically being a bottle neck type pores zno ac composite seems to exhibit a relatively sharper increasing isotherm than the tio2 ac complex indicating the possibility of a higher proportion of mesopores and a lower effective surface area for the zno ac complex the analyzed pore characterization data in table 1 also shows that zno ac composite has higher total pore volume than tio2 ac however with a smaller micropore volume bet surface area was estimated to be 1555 m2 g for ac nuchar sa 20 while it has reduced to 970 m2 g for tio2 ac and to 889 m2 g for zno ac in addition to the surface area the total pore volume of the synthesized composites are lower than the virgin carbon matrix as well this reduction in surface area and pore volume is due to the process of metal impregnation that possibly contributed to partial blockage of the pores a lower surface area for the zno ac complex could also be envisaged based on sharper increase in the adsorption isotherm beyond a relative pressure of 0 1 sem analysis was employed to shed light on surface morphology mass distribution and crystallinity of the synthesized tio2 ac and zno ac composites and the micrographs are shown in fig 3 a d respectively in fig 3a and b evenly dispersed titanium dioxide on the surface of activated carbon could be observed and the size of the impregnated titanium dioxide was much smaller than the size of an activated carbon particle precipitation of precursor by peg during the synthesis may have prevented the aggregation of the carbon particles the formation of the titanium dioxide on pores may have reduced the surface area of the overall catalyst 20 fig 3c and d displays sem image of activated carbon supported zinc oxide crystalline catalyst with the shape of rods zinc oxide particles are seen being crystalized as hexagonal shape of the rods on the carbon surface fig 3c shows unblocked channels regardless of grown zinc oxide crystalline including nano rods on the surface zinc oxides crystalline on the surface are sometimes formed at the entrance of the channel that could have contributed to the surface area decrease overall photocatalysts are dispersed evenly on the surface and thus a synergetic effect of catalyst and carbon matrix could be expected by the catalyst composites energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx was equipped together with sem analyzer to identify the element composition of synthesized catalysts near the surface metal element composition by weight on the surface is a critical factor to predict the biofunctionality of the composite edx spectra of tio2 ac composite is shown in fig 4 a and that of zno ac is shown in fig 4b further mapping images of each elements shown in fig 5 confirms even distribution of elements cross the composite material which is in agreement with sem images and can be interpreted as metal oxides that were evenly synthesized on the carbon surface 20 structural properties and mineralogical information were provided through the recognition of crystal phase from xrd analysis and presented in fig 6 broad and noticeable peak has been observed for activated carbon sa20 nuchar around 20 26 2θ and small peak around 44 2θ this pattern is similar with that of xrd peaks obtained for nuchar activated carbon powder reported elsewhere 21 for synthetic tio2 ac the overall trend is similar with the sa20 and intensity of peaks became lower due to the synthesis the peak of powder type titanium dioxide generally shows maximum peak around 25 3 2θ 101 plane which is overlapped with the broad peak range of carbon the major peak around 25 2θ shifted slightly to the right on tio2 ac graph than ac graph which is common when metal oxide is incorporated ftir analysis provides the information of functional groups and bonding between dopant and support on the surface with non destructive nature ftir spectra of the synthetic tio2 ac and zno ac composite are shown in fig 6a and b wide and broad peaks from 400 cm 1 to 800 cm 1 typically corresponded to the bulk titanium dioxide skeletal including tio and tioti bond 22 the peak around 565 cm 1 is assigned to ti o ti and peak around 755 cm 1 to tioc functional group 23 small peak at 883 cm 1 corresponds to ti o and ti o ti of tio2 b 24 the peaks around 1060 cm 1 and 1157 cm 1 are assigned to co bonding referring that bond around 1050 cm 1 is related to primary alcohol co stretch and around 1150 cm 1 is tertiary alcohol 25 co bond is recognized around 1594 cm 1 as 1500 to 1750 cm 1 is assigned to co axial deformation wide decreasing peak around 2260 cm 1 is assigned to medial alkyne cc 2260 2100 cm 1 the ftir spectrum of zno ac composite is given in fig 6b shows a similar trend as tio2 ac composite sharp and intense peak around 480 cm 1 could be related to zno bond co bonding at 1055 cm 1and cc double bond at 1411 cm 1 co bond and oh bond are seen at 1568 cm 1 and near 3387 cm 1 functional groups are deeply related to the functionality on the surface of composite 26 and abundant functional groups are detected on both synthetic composites 3 2 phenol degradation study 3 2 1 preliminary results fig 7 shows a sample hplc raw data plot comparing phenol measurement intensity with different metal oxide catalysts as it can be seen a characteristic peak corresponding to phenol is detected after 3 8 min for both the metal catalysts at the start of the adsorption process the intensity corresponding to phenol concentration is high however after 240 min of adsorption time it can be noticed that zno ac catalyst shows lesser phenol concentration than tio2 ac catalyst due to phenol degradation from the relative intensities phenol concentration and degradation efficiency was calculated using eq 1 the effect of uv illumination was assessed beforehand to check the efficiency of light source on phenol degradation degradation experiment was conducted for 240 min varying the initial concentration of phenol and the results are illustrated in fig 8 a obviously the elevated initial concentration of phenol resulted in the decrease in degradation efficiency within 240 min phenol removal by uv was 100 89 57 and 37 for 10 ppm 20 ppm 50 ppm and 100 ppm solution respectively the fastest kinetics almost full degradation was seen for 10 ppm solution whereas the removal efficiency for 100 ppm was only 37 the phenol degradation study with activated carbon was conducted to compare adsorption capacity of porous matrix with synthetic tio2 ac and zno ac composites the experiment was performed in the dark condition with 50 ppm initial concentration 1 g l adsorbent dosage stirring at 400 rpm and room temperature and the results are presented in fig 8b experimental parameters were selected similar to the conditions in wastewater treatment adsorption process was almost completed in the first 10 min for most of adsorbents including synthetic catalysts and the most effective adsorbent was activated carbon nuchar sa20 this was an expected result considering the noticeably high surface area of applied ac only 54 and 60 removal were recorded for tio2 ac and zno ac and less than 5 adsorption was observed for photocatalysts without carbon matrix this was also expected owing to low surface area of the metal oxides and the high adsorption capacity of synthesized catalysts comes from the functionality of carbon matrix 3 2 2 comparison of synthesized catalysts on phenol degradation photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of tio2 ac and zno ac composites for phenol degradation were evaluated under uv light fig 9 a the experiment conditions were chosen with the reference from a typical commercial waste water treatment site 50 ppm of initial phenol concentration 1 g l catalyst dosage 400 rpm stirrer speed and slightly elevated room temperature 32 3 c to account for the exothermic effect of uv irradiation based on the comparison presented in fig 8a the degradation efficiencies of zno ac and tio2 ac were higher than the pure activated carbon matrix under light illumination recorded removal efficiency for zno ac was 85 and for tio2 ac was 75 while activated carbon showed only 73 degradation for 240 min it can be observed that the degradation efficiency of synthesized composites continues to increase with time by photocatalytic degradation while ac remains constant limited by the availability of the adsorption sites the increase in the degradation efficiency with the photocatalyst is due to the continuous conversion of phenol into co2 and water it should be noted that on the other hand the faster adsorption kinetics of ac contribute to high removal efficiency at low duration the benefit of metal oxide ac composite is the unification of the higher adsorption rate and capacity of the ac with the catalytic effectiveness rendering overall better performance it can be assumed that photocatalytic activity of well crystalized zno on composite surface contributes to the high efficiency further extension of duration time will favor degradation driving complete conversion of phenol with the metal oxide ac complex significantly faster than the adsorbent with the uv system in order to understand the effectiveness of tio2 and zno catalysts independently for phenol degradation commercial tio2 and zno were tested under exposure to uv light maintaining similar conditions see fig 9 b in comparison with synthesized composites commercial zno catalyst showed highest phenol degradation of 90 while commercial tio2 results in 88 degradation efficiency at a duration of 240 min the trends of degradation clearly indicate that the degradation was higher at lower times for the composite material as compared to the virgin commercial catalyst the faster reduction in the phenol concentration with the composite material can be attributed to the faster adsorption kinetics of the ac and hence contributed to a much faster decrease in the concentration of phenol as compared to virgin catalyst however with increase in exposure time the ability of the virgin catalyst to degrade the phenol takes over as the degradation capacity of the composite material is limited by the additional diffusional resistance which would be absent for the virgin material the efficiency difference between commercial zno and zno ac composite is approximately 5 it is understandable in that white powder type commercial zinc oxide and titanium dioxide used were almost fully emulsified in the solution and the entire amount could be exposed enough to the uv light light absorption study in photocatalytic reactor by alfano et al 27 clearly stated that batch photocatalytic system with suspended powder type catalyst should consider light scattering in evaluating the absorbed light which is important factor for photolysis absorbed light by existing black carbon may hinder the effective photocatalytic degradation whereas less hindrance is expected for the system with commercial catalyst the reduced efficiency with the composite material could be attributed to the presence of black carbon while the improved performance with the virgin catalyst could be due to the improved reflection effect of white color itself application of commercial catalysts is seldom viable although the virgin commercial catalyst could offer better degradation efficiency separation of emulsified metal oxide would significantly add to the waste treatment cost leaving the metal oxide without separation would results in subsequent environmental damages hence the metal oxide ac composite has an added advantage of the possibility to separate the catalyst easily subject it to regeneration and reuse for subsequent operations 3 2 3 effect of catalyst dosage based on the phenol degradation results presented in the previous section zno ac showed better performance than tio2 ac the dosage of zno ac catalyst under uv light was varied in the range of 0 1 g l to 1 g l in order to assess the effect of catalyst and the results are presented in fig 10 a the initial concentration of phenol was maintained at 50 ppm while other conditions were maintained constant the removal efficiency enhanced with increase in the catalyst dosage for all duration of the treatment the degradation efficiency was found to be 85 81 5 79 7 and 76 44 for 0 1 g l 0 2 g l 0 5 g l and 1 g l dosage respectively at 240 min the improved degradation efficiency with increase in dosage is likely to be associated with increased adsorption capacity by carbon matrix and higher number of active sites for photocatalytic activity 24 the effect of increase of the catalyst dosage is more significant at short duration as compared to long duration at long term exposure the lower amount of catalyst is sufficient to take care of available phenol at low concentration hence no significant benefit of higher dosage of the catalyst could be realized 3 2 4 effect of initial concentration of phenol the effect of initial concentration over a range from 10 to 100 ppm is illustrated in fig 10 b a decrease in the degradation efficiency with increase in the initial concentration of phenol for the zno ac catalyst could be noticed as expected the degradation is complete with low concentration of phenol while the conversion is lower for high initial concentrations with the increase of initial concentration the degradation load increases and hence an overall reduction in the conversion efficiency although the kinetics of degradation was expected to be faster with increase in the initial concentration the higher overall load contributed to an overall lower degradation the rate of degradation was extremely fast at short durations while it tended to get slower significantly at long durations fast reaction at short duration could be attributed to the concentration driving force for reaction as well as the mass transfer both factors possibly contributed to high rates of degradation 3 3 reaction kinetics kinetics study is essential to evaluate the performance of a given catalyst and to understand the reaction mechanism simple first order and second order kinetic model was applied for various initial phenol concentration system basic equations of first order model expressed in differential and integrated form are shown in eq s 2 and 3 28 the differential and integrated from of equations for second order model are expressed in eqs 4 and 5 2 d c d t k 1 c 3 c t c 0 e k 1 t 4 d c d t k 2 c 2 5 1 c t 1 c 0 k 2 t where c0 is the initial concentration of phenol mg l ct is phenol centration at time t mg l k1 is apparent kinetic rate constant min 1 for first order model and k2 is apparent kinetic rate constant of second order reaction kinetics l mol min kinetic parameters of each model k1 and k2 were estimated by linear regression and the corresponding r2 regression coefficient are provided fig 11 a depicts the first order kinetic model of phenol degradation the derived kinetic constant k1 are 0 0228 0 0072 0 0055 and 0 0046 for 10 ppm 20 ppm 50 ppm and 100 ppm respectively with a corresponding r2 of 0 9262 0 9631 0 9973 and 0 9872 apart from the degradation kinetics of 10 ppm solution first order model was suitable for the photocatalytic degradation on zno ac composite a second order kinetic model plot for phenol removal using zno ac is displayed in fig 11b and the derived kinetic constant k2 are 0 3518 0 0017 0 0003 and 0 0001 for 10 ppm 20 ppm 50 ppm and 100 ppm solution respectively with an r2 of 0 6386 0 8333 0 9637 and 0 9949 the degradation kinetics for 50 ppm and 100 ppm agrees well with second order model whereas second order model is not suitable to interpret 10 ppm and 20 ppm kinetics the parameters of two kinetic models for phenol degradation by zno ac composite are tabulated in table 2 overall the reaction kinetics values showed a better fit with first order reaction model the value of r2 indicate that phenol degradation using zno ac composite at initial concentration lower than 100 ppm fits better to the first order kinetic model 50 mg l whereas degradation rate at initial concentration 100 ppm showed good agreement with second order model r2 value 0 9949 the observed shift to second order kinetics at high concentrations could originate from the degradation mechanism transformation or combination of several mechanisms in the reaction phenol removal efficiency during the first 10 min seemed to be dominated by adsorption in the carbon matrix while the removal at high initial concentration takes place in a step wise manner with respect to time the trend of reaction kinetics varied depending on the initial concentration of phenolic solution this kinetic model transformation is similarly observed on dye degradation by carbon supported photocatalytic composite reported in a recent publication 24 with regards to decreasing tendency of rate constant with increase of initial concentration limited accessibility of phenol on active sites might be the possible explanation elevated adsorbate concentration on the active sites of composite leads to competitive adsorption between organic molecules or even with generated hydroxyl radicals on active sites excess concentration on the surface could also hinder the absorbance of photons by catalyst leading the stated tendency similar trend and explanation for the mechanism were reported in several articles earlier 24 29 3 4 comparison of present work with previous studies table 3 compares the adsorption data from the present work with the literature utilizing composite catalyst phenol degradation study by fatimah et al 30 tried to impregnate zno nanoparticles wurtzite on the activated carbon photocatalytic degradation effect was tested with 5 g l catalyst dosage at 10 ppm of initial phenol concentration solution and 80 of degradation was achieved in an hour such high catalyst dosage is hard to be accepted from economic sense however a conversion efficiency of 88 could be achieved within one hour duration as demonstrated in the present work with a catalyst dosage of 1 g l this could be attributed to the enhanced functionality by crystallizing rod like zinc oxide on the carbon surface on the other hand there were diverse trials to degrade phenol by titanium supported by carbon matrix recent attempt by abussaud et al 8 with tio2 activated carbon catalyst have reported 89 degradation in 120 min with 2 ppm phenol solution at ph 7 at 298 k the functionality of the catalyst entirely arises from adsorption as there was no light source the reported degradation efficiency could be purely due to adsorption and not due to degradation due to lack of uv radiation since the initial concentration was 2 ppm high removal with activated carbon was feasible another attempt by matos et al 31 reported mixing effect of tio2 p25 and activated carbon with catalyst ratio tio2 ac 5 1 under the condition of 125 w high pressure mercury lamp 3 g l dosage and 94 ppm of the initial concentration for 180 min high dosage of powder type tio2 contributed to complete degradation this system however seems to have limitations that emulsified tio2 should be recovered and tio2 ratio in the mixture should remain high to adapt in adsorption unit the present work showed 74 degradation at an initial concentration of 100 ppm in 180 min and reduced the catalyst dosage to one third of 1 g l and illuminate lower voltage light source of 8 1 w which is over 10 times less than 125 w while preventing the emulsification of photocatalyst powder in the solution and making the catalyst recovery easier 3 5 phenol degradation mechanism on zno ac composite the mechanism of phenolic degradation with the zno ac composite consisted of two stages with the first stage being dominated by adsorption while the second stage being reaction dominated at first there are mainly four steps involved in adsorption process including external mass transfer so called bulk transfer film resistance internal diffusion and adsorption at active site 32 considering the experiments were conducted with good stirring mass transfer could possibly be limited only by the diffusion resistance followed by the adsorption on active sites on the other hand photocatalytic degradation of phenol involves three major steps including adsorption of organic molecule light absorption and charge transfer to generate active radicals to degrade the molecule 33 to get good photocatalytic degradation strengthened adsorption minimal hindrance for light absorption and smooth charge transfer are essential zno ac shows good degradation rate on phenol possibly due to synergetic effect of carbon matrix and zno photocatalyst the existence of activated carbon enhances the adsorption capacity and allows the smooth supply of phenol to the active sites in situ regeneration of activated carbon could be also possible as adsorbed phenol is degraded by photocatalytic reaction instead of remaining on the surface however further research is required to get an elaborated idea of overall degradation mechanism 4 conclusions photocatalytic degradation efficiency of phenol by tio2 ac and zno ac catalysts were investigated to assess the suitability to wastewater treatment system tio2 ac and zno ac composites were successfully synthesized via hydrothermal method using activated carbon and metal oxide precursors various techniques including sem edx xrd ftir and bet analysis used to characterize the synthesized tio2 ac and zno ac revealed that titanium dioxide and zinc oxide were evenly distributed on the carbon surface and clear crystalline zinc oxide with shape of rod was observed for zno ac further ftir analysis confirmed the presence of functional groups on the composite surface zno ac composite and tio2 ac composite proved enhanced degradation efficiency than activated carbon matrix alone in phenol degradation study under uv irradiation for 240 min as compared to tio2 ac zno ac composite exhibited higher degradation efficiency under identical conditions the effects of duration catalyst dosage and initial concentration of phenol were tested to identify optimal operating condition of zno ac accordingly the highest efficiency was recorded at the maximum of duration of experiment in the present study 240 min for all catalysts and an increase in the catalyst dosage was found to increase the degradation efficiency kinetic studies with the selected zno ac catalyst was interpreted using first order and second order reaction models phenol degradation at lower initial concentrations 100 ppm showed a better fit with the first order kinetic model whereas the degradation at higher initial concentrations followed second order model based on overall results synergetic effect of adsorption and photocatalytic degradation on zno ac composite improved the phenol removal efficiency the applied experiment condition of room temperature neutral ph condition and low level of initial concentration reflected the real wastewater treatment condition so that the results can be extended to the industrial application comparison of present work with literature revealed that the synthesized zno ac exhibited significantly improved functionality synthesized zno ac didn t compromise the degradation efficiency while eliminated the emulsified nature of nano sized commercial photo catalyst by embedding on the carbon surface acknowledgement the authors would like to extend their sincere appreciation to center for membrane and advanced water technology cmat khalifa university for providing

14353,refinery wastewater contains light fractions of aliphatic and aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons such as phenol which demands removal to acceptable levels before being discharged into water bodies literature based screening of various metal oxide catalysts for phenol degradation indicated oxides of titanium and zinc to be the most effective catalysts tio2 activated carbon ac and zno ac catalysts were synthesized via hydrothermal methods and tested for phenol degradation physicochemical characterization of the synthesized catalyst revealed evenly distributed nano sized titanium dioxide and well crystalized zno structure on the carbon surface while the composite synthesis process reduced the overall bet surface area of both zno ac and tio2 ac it retained the major surface functional groups of ac with addition to metal oxides in the porous complex synthesized zno ac and tio2 ac showed improved phenol degradation efficiency than pure activated carbon under uv light illumination effect of various process parameters such as illumination duration catalyst dosage and initial concentration of phenol were assessed to identify optimal conditions for maximum degradation further kinetic data were generated and the results were validated using reaction models to evaluate the degradation mechanism at lower concentrations the kinetic parameters matched well with the first order reaction model while at higher concentrations it followed second order kinetics owing to the shift in the mechanism of adsorption the relatively enhanced phenol degradation efficiency by zno ac over tio2 ac composite could be attributed to the synergetic effect of adsorption and photocatalytic degradation keywords phenol degradation photocatalytic oxidation tio2 ac zno ac uv light 1 introduction refineries produce huge volumes of wastewater that is approximately 0 4 1 6 times of the processed oil during crude oil processing 1 2 refinery wastewater contains light fractions of aliphatic and aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons such as phenol which poses severe hse issues if not treated properly 3 us environmental protection agency usepa regulations for discharging waste water into oceans suggest concentrations to be below 1 ppm of phenol 4 while the uae government standards are more restrictive in the range of 0 1 ppm of phenol 5 typical concentrations of phenolic compounds in untreated refinery wastewater were found to be in the range of 11 to 14 ppm 2 it is therefore essential to develop an efficient economical and environmentally friendly treatment process that will remove phenol from wastewater to desired levels phenol is known to be a recalcitrant compound due to its toxicity and non biodegradable properties and thus has received serious attention for safer processing and handling phenol treatment technologies in wastewater can be categorized into two parts separation techniques and destructive techniques 6 separation technique is a non destructive technique that allows for recovery of phenol via steam distillation extraction adsorption membrane pervaporation and membrane based solvent extraction destructive techniques on the other hand includes electrochemical oxidation photocatalytic oxidation chemical oxidation and biochemical abatement among various techniques adsorption has received widespread attention because of its non destructive nature and effectiveness and there has been numerous on going research in finding effective adsorbents to treat phenolic wastewater 7 activated carbon is one of the most popular adsorbents for the treatment of organic compounds in wastewater including phenol the major constituent of activated carbon is carbon and other hetero atoms such as hydrogen nitrogen oxygen and sulfur accounting for more than 95 by weight 7 the key features of activated carbon are high porosity large surface area unique adsorptive and reusable properties through regeneration which makes activated carbon an attractive adsorbent 8 10 there are two types of activated carbon depending on the shape of material granular activated carbon gac and powdered activated carbon pac activated carbon needs to undergo regeneration to restore adsorption efficiency however the process remains expensive and causes loss of adsorbents 11 several options were attempted to improve the functionality and life time of activated carbon system including chemical modification impregnation with nanoparticles alternate carbon precursors and modified activation methods among them impregnation on activated carbon has been a promising technique for complete destruction of phenol to other relatively safer molecules many recent studies have focused on identifying effective catalyst to maximize the removal efficiency metals metal oxide impregnated porous matrix are common in catalyst development owing to effectiveness the porous structure of the activated carbon can be widely varied depending upon the host molecule that needs to be embedded there has been minimal attention on metal oxide embedded porous systems despite the large surface area offered by the porous matrix catalyst screening was performed with the following criteria in consideration of its applicability to refinery wastewater first the catalyst should show good performance in effluent discharging conditions the regulation limit of discharged petroleum wastewater is in the range of temperature 22 41 c and a ph of 6 2 10 6 12 some catalysts however require higher temperature or lower ph to maximize the reaction in such cases it is likely to result in incomplete reaction when they are used in tertiary wastewater treatment processes secondly the catalyst should have been widely researched and tested for similar applications the catalyst is usually immersed in large volume of wastewater and is easily deactivated by impurities in the process the availability of information such as surface mechanism can allow us to predict the side reaction and corrosion so as to identify the optimal operating condition not clear lastly the catalyst should be cost effective and environment friendly with the stated advantages an effective metal oxide was selected to be embedded on activated carbon for the removal of phenol through thorough literature screening of similar adsorbents metal oxide catalysts including titanium oxide tio2 aluminum oxide al2o3 copper oxide cuo zinc oxide zno and iron oxide fe2o3 were chosen based on the criteria suggested above and were reviewed intensely tio2 and zno seemed to be the most promising catalysts suitable for phenol adsorption titanium oxide tio2 nanoparticles has shown significant phenol degradation in the range of 50 99 as a single metal refer table 3 while zno was found to be in the range of 52 98 depending on the experiment conditions the potential of copper oxide cuo as a phenol degradation catalyst has been mostly focused at high temperature conditions than room temperatures refer table 3 copper leaching was reported to be another issue that had to be taken into consideration fe has been recently studied as fenton reaction ferrous ion fe2 h2o2 or fenton like reaction ferric ion fe3 h2o2 rather than iron oxide form on the other hand there was insufficient information to elaborate the intrinsic efficiency of al2o3 in phenol degradation accordingly the present work would attempt to embed metal oxides in the porous carbon matrix for its application towards degradation of phenolic compounds photocatalytic oxidation using tio2 and zno seems to contribute to the improvement of the reaction rate absorption of photon with higher energy than band gap of photocatalyst initiates the photocatalysis photocatalytic oxidation efficiency of phenol degradation can fluctuate depending on the light source the form and size of crystallinity and catalyst dosage tio2 has received extensive attention because of its high activity desirable physical and chemical properties low cost availability and environmentally friendly feature there are mainly three forms of tio2 including brookite rutile and anatase the ratio between anatase phase and rutile phase however plays a significant role in the degradation according to the comparison study of titanium dioxide varying ratio of anatase and rutile 13 light source is also an important factor where the rate of initiation for photo catalysis especially electron hole formation is strongly dependent on light intensity 14 light intensity distribution within the photocatalytic reactor may play a significant role during the process zno is also a promising photocatalyst with advantage of wide absorption spectrum no risk for human health environment friendly feature similar band gap with tio2 and lower cost than tio2 the fast recombination of photogenerated charges and the formation of zn oh 2 in the water are possible to limit the reaction 15 impregnation in porous carbon matrix eliminates problem of catalyst loss through the formation of emulsion with waste water rendering the catalyst suitable for packed bed operation synergetic effect of activated carbon and photocatalyst for phenol degradation has received less attention from the scientific community the present work aims to identify effective metal oxide doped activated carbon catalysts for phenol degradation and to provide a systematic framework for assessing the effectiveness of activated carbon supported photocatalyst in phenol degradation under tertiary wastewater treatment condition the work would facilitate identification of the most efficient catalyst and the optimal process conditions that would provide the maximum phenol degradation moreover the synergistic effect of activated carbon and photocatalyst would be simultaneously evaluated 2 experimental 2 1 catalyst synthesis to synthesize tio2 ac composite titanium isopropoxide c12h28o4ti 97 sigma aldrich was used as a titanium precursor in ethanol polyethylene glycol peg was added to enhance the colloidal stability and to lead well distributed titanium dioxide on carbon surface thus preventing aggregation and sedimentation 16 the solution was sonicated for 30 min to attain complete dissolution commercial activated carbon nuchar sa 20 was dispersed in ethanol as a second solution activated carbon solution was added to the precursor solution and again sonicated for two hours to ensure impregnation of catalyst inside the carbon matrix the mixture was maintained at 70 c for several hours finally the solution was washed with deionized water several times filtered and dried overnight in the oven at 80 c for zno ac composite synthesis zinc acetate dehydrate zn ch3coo 2 2h2o was chosen as a precursor and hexamethylenetetramine hmta c6h12n4 sigma aldrich as a surfactant to control nucleation and to modify the morphology of zno rod structure zinc acetate and hmta solutions are mixed and the ph of the solution was adjusted to 8 by adding naoh solution and diluted to 100 ml with deionized water activated carbon sa20 was added to the solution following which the solution was kept in ultrasonic bath for 30 min the mixture was placed on a hot plate with intense agitation at 70 c and maintained overnight the synthesized zno ac composite was filtered rinsed with deionized water and dried in the oven at 80 c overnight 2 2 catalyst characterization

pore size were measured by bet surface analysis with micromeritics 3 flex analyzer under nitrogen purging condition samples were pretreated under degassing at 150 c for 3 h to remove any adsorbed species 2 3 phenol degradation study degradation of phenol was carried out using the synthesized tio2 ac and zno ac composite under uv irradiation as a batch experiment each phenol solution with specific concentration was diluted from stock solution the chosen catalyst was suspended in 300 ml of phenol solution in a triangular flask in which an 8 1 w uv lamp was inserted as an uv source the lamp was kept in a quartz tube and immersed completely into the solution the mixture was stirred vigorously at 400 rpm to exclude mass transfer limitations from liquid to solid phase during the reaction the temperature of the solution was kept 32 c 3 by heat irradiation from uv lamp and the experiments were continued for 240 min 3 ml samples were withdrawn by the syringe at regular time intervals time and filtered using a 0 45 μm millipore filters degradation study with activated carbon sa 20 nuchar commercial tio2 p25 and zno catalyst were also conducted under uv irradiation to serve as a reference for photocatalytic degradation 0 2 μm nylon millipore filters were specially used to deal with nano sized particles of commercial tio2 and zno catalysts with selected catalyst that showed better degradation efficiency kinetic studies were carried out varying the catalyst dosage from 0 1 g l to 1 g l and initial concentration of phenol from 10 ppm to 100 ppm the degradation efficiency of phenol was determined through the following equation 1 d e g r a d a t i o n p e r c e n t a g e 100 c 0 c t c 0 where c0 is the initial concentration of phenol and ct is the concentration of phenol after time t min schematic diagram for photocatalytic reactor setup is shown in fig 1 collected samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc with acquity uplc h class system from waters company 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization bet analysis was performed on the synthesized catalysts in order to understand pore network and also to estimate pore size and surface area n2 adsorption desorption isotherms on the two selected catalysts are presented in fig 2 adsorption isotherms indicate a sharp increase in adsorption at lower relative pressures 0 1 beyond which it continues to increase gradually with again a sharp increase at near saturation relative pressure formation of clear hysteresis loop is observed during the desorption isotherm the sharp increase at low partial pressure are attributed to the presence of micropores while the progressive increase at higher relative pressures could be attributed to the presence of mesopores 18 the sharp increase in adsorption near the saturation relative pressure could be attributed to the condensation of nitrogen in the porous matrix all the adsorption isotherms could be categorized as a type iv standard adsorption isotherm 19 which characterizes materials possessing mixed proportions of micro and mesopores the formation of hysteresis loop as well confirms pores of these nature and the pores possibly being a network of mixed pores with the majority of it typically being a bottle neck type pores zno ac composite seems to exhibit a relatively sharper increasing isotherm than the tio2 ac complex indicating the possibility of a higher proportion of mesopores and a lower effective surface area for the zno ac complex the analyzed pore characterization data in table 1 also shows that zno ac composite has higher total pore volume than tio2 ac however with a smaller micropore volume bet surface area was estimated to be 1555 m2 g for ac nuchar sa 20 while it has reduced to 970 m2 g for tio2 ac and to 889 m2 g for zno ac in addition to the surface area the total pore volume of the synthesized composites are lower than the virgin carbon matrix as well this reduction in surface area and pore volume is due to the process of metal impregnation that possibly contributed to partial blockage of the pores a lower surface area for the zno ac complex could also be envisaged based on sharper increase in the adsorption isotherm beyond a relative pressure of 0 1 sem analysis was employed to shed light on surface morphology mass distribution and crystallinity of the synthesized tio2 ac and zno ac composites and the micrographs are shown in fig 3 a d respectively in fig 3a and b evenly dispersed titanium dioxide on the surface of activated carbon could be observed and the size of the impregnated titanium dioxide was much smaller than the size of an activated carbon particle precipitation of precursor by peg during the synthesis may have prevented the aggregation of the carbon particles the formation of the titanium dioxide on pores may have reduced the surface area of the overall catalyst 20 fig 3c and d displays sem image of activated carbon supported zinc oxide crystalline catalyst with the shape of rods zinc oxide particles are seen being crystalized as hexagonal shape of the rods on the carbon surface fig 3c shows unblocked channels regardless of grown zinc oxide crystalline including nano rods on the surface zinc oxides crystalline on the surface are sometimes formed at the entrance of the channel that could have contributed to the surface area decrease overall photocatalysts are dispersed evenly on the surface and thus a synergetic effect of catalyst and carbon matrix could be expected by the catalyst composites energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx was equipped together with sem analyzer to identify the element composition of synthesized catalysts near the surface metal element composition by weight on the surface is a critical factor to predict the biofunctionality of the composite edx spectra of tio2 ac composite is shown in fig 4 a and that of zno ac is shown in fig 4b further mapping images of each elements shown in fig 5 confirms even distribution of elements cross the composite material which is in agreement with sem images and can be interpreted as metal oxides that were evenly synthesized on the carbon surface 20 structural properties and mineralogical information were provided through the recognition of crystal phase from xrd analysis and presented in fig 6 broad and noticeable peak has been observed for activated carbon sa20 nuchar around 20 26 2θ and small peak around 44 2θ this pattern is similar with that of xrd peaks obtained for nuchar activated carbon powder reported elsewhere 21 for synthetic tio2 ac the overall trend is similar with the sa20 and intensity of peaks became lower due to the synthesis the peak of powder type titanium dioxide generally shows maximum peak around 25 3 2θ 101 plane which is overlapped with the broad peak range of carbon the major peak around 25 2θ shifted slightly to the right on tio2 ac graph than ac graph which is common when metal oxide is incorporated ftir analysis provides the information of functional groups and bonding between dopant and support on the surface with non destructive nature ftir spectra of the synthetic tio2 ac and zno ac composite are shown in fig 6a and b wide and broad peaks from 400 cm 1 to 800 cm 1 typically corresponded to the bulk titanium dioxide skeletal including tio and tioti bond 22 the peak around 565 cm 1 is assigned to ti o ti and peak around 755 cm 1 to tioc functional group 23 small peak at 883 cm 1 corresponds to ti o and ti o ti of tio2 b 24 the peaks around 1060 cm 1 and 1157 cm 1 are assigned to co bonding referring that bond around 1050 cm 1 is related to primary alcohol co stretch and around 1150 cm 1 is tertiary alcohol 25 co bond is recognized around 1594 cm 1 as 1500 to 1750 cm 1 is assigned to co axial deformation wide decreasing peak around 2260 cm 1 is assigned to medial alkyne cc 2260 2100 cm 1 the ftir spectrum of zno ac composite is given in fig 6b shows a similar trend as tio2 ac composite sharp and intense peak around 480 cm 1 could be related to zno bond co bonding at 1055 cm 1and cc double bond at 1411 cm 1 co bond and oh bond are seen at 1568 cm 1 and near 3387 cm 1 functional groups are deeply related to the functionality on the surface of composite 26 and abundant functional groups are detected on both synthetic composites 3 2 phenol degradation study 3 2 1 preliminary results fig 7 shows a sample hplc raw data plot comparing phenol measurement intensity with different metal oxide catalysts as it can be seen a characteristic peak corresponding to phenol is detected after 3 8 min for both the metal catalysts at the start of the adsorption process the intensity corresponding to phenol concentration is high however after 240 min of adsorption time it can be noticed that zno ac catalyst shows lesser phenol concentration than tio2 ac catalyst due to phenol degradation from the relative intensities phenol concentration and degradation efficiency was calculated using eq 1 the effect of uv illumination was assessed beforehand to check the efficiency of light source on phenol degradation degradation experiment was conducted for 240 min varying the initial concentration of phenol and the results are illustrated in fig 8 a obviously the elevated initial concentration of phenol resulted in the decrease in degradation efficiency within 240 min phenol removal by uv was 100 89 57 and 37 for 10 ppm 20 ppm 50 ppm and 100 ppm solution respectively the fastest kinetics almost full degradation was seen for 10 ppm solution whereas the removal efficiency for 100 ppm was only 37 the phenol degradation study with activated carbon was conducted to compare adsorption capacity of porous matrix with synthetic tio2 ac and zno ac composites the experiment was performed in the dark condition with 50 ppm initial concentration 1 g l adsorbent dosage stirring at 400 rpm and room temperature and the results are presented in fig 8b experimental parameters were selected similar to the conditions in wastewater treatment adsorption process was almost completed in the first 10 min for most of adsorbents including synthetic catalysts and the most effective adsorbent was activated carbon nuchar sa20 this was an expected result considering the noticeably high surface area of applied ac only 54 and 60 removal were recorded for tio2 ac and zno ac and less than 5 adsorption was observed for photocatalysts without carbon matrix this was also expected owing to low surface area of the metal oxides and the high adsorption capacity of synthesized catalysts comes from the functionality of carbon matrix 3 2 2 comparison of synthesized catalysts on phenol degradation photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of tio2 ac and zno ac composites for phenol degradation were evaluated under uv light fig 9 a the experiment conditions were chosen with the reference from a typical commercial waste water treatment site 50 ppm of initial phenol concentration 1 g l catalyst dosage 400 rpm stirrer speed and slightly elevated room temperature 32 3 c to account for the exothermic effect of uv irradiation based on the comparison presented in fig 8a the degradation efficiencies of zno ac and tio2 ac were higher than the pure activated carbon matrix under light illumination recorded removal efficiency for zno ac was 85 and for tio2 ac was 75 while activated carbon showed only 73 degradation for 240 min it can be observed that the degradation efficiency of synthesized composites continues to increase with time by photocatalytic degradation while ac remains constant limited by the availability of the adsorption sites the increase in the degradation efficiency with the photocatalyst is due to the continuous conversion of phenol into co2 and water it should be noted that on the other hand the faster adsorption kinetics of ac contribute to high removal efficiency at low duration the benefit of metal oxide ac composite is the unification of the higher adsorption rate and capacity of the ac with the catalytic effectiveness rendering overall better performance it can be assumed that photocatalytic activity of well crystalized zno on composite surface contributes to the high efficiency further extension of duration time will favor degradation driving complete conversion of phenol with the metal oxide ac complex significantly faster than the adsorbent with the uv system in order to understand the effectiveness of tio2 and zno catalysts independently for phenol degradation commercial tio2 and zno were tested under exposure to uv light maintaining similar conditions see fig 9 b in comparison with synthesized composites commercial zno catalyst showed highest phenol degradation of 90 while commercial tio2 results in 88 degradation efficiency at a duration of 240 min the trends of degradation clearly indicate that the degradation was higher at lower times for the composite material as compared to the virgin commercial catalyst the faster reduction in the phenol concentration with the composite material can be attributed to the faster adsorption kinetics of the ac and hence contributed to a much faster decrease in the concentration of phenol as compared to virgin catalyst however with increase in exposure time the ability of the virgin catalyst to degrade the phenol takes over as the degradation capacity of the composite material is limited by the additional diffusional resistance which would be absent for the virgin material the efficiency difference between commercial zno and zno ac composite is approximately 5 it is understandable in that white powder type commercial zinc oxide and titanium dioxide used were almost fully emulsified in the solution and the entire amount could be exposed enough to the uv light light absorption study in photocatalytic reactor by alfano et al 27 clearly stated that batch photocatalytic system with suspended powder type catalyst should consider light scattering in evaluating the absorbed light which is important factor for photolysis absorbed light by existing black carbon may hinder the effective photocatalytic degradation whereas less hindrance is expected for the system with commercial catalyst the reduced efficiency with the composite material could be attributed to the presence of black carbon while the improved performance with the virgin catalyst could be due to the improved reflection effect of white color itself application of commercial catalysts is seldom viable although the virgin commercial catalyst could offer better degradation efficiency separation of emulsified metal oxide would significantly add to the waste treatment cost leaving the metal oxide without separation would results in subsequent environmental damages hence the metal oxide ac composite has an added advantage of the possibility to separate the catalyst easily subject it to regeneration and reuse for subsequent operations 3 2 3 effect of catalyst dosage based on the phenol degradation results presented in the previous section zno ac showed better performance than tio2 ac the dosage of zno ac catalyst under uv light was varied in the range of 0 1 g l to 1 g l in order to assess the effect of catalyst and the results are presented in fig 10 a the initial concentration of phenol was maintained at 50 ppm while other conditions were maintained constant the removal efficiency enhanced with increase in the catalyst dosage for all duration of the treatment the degradation efficiency was found to be 85 81 5 79 7 and 76 44 for 0 1 g l 0 2 g l 0 5 g l and 1 g l dosage respectively at 240 min the improved degradation efficiency with increase in dosage is likely to be associated with increased adsorption capacity by carbon matrix and higher number of active sites for photocatalytic activity 24 the effect of increase of the catalyst dosage is more significant at short duration as compared to long duration at long term exposure the lower amount of catalyst is sufficient to take care of available phenol at low concentration hence no significant benefit of higher dosage of the catalyst could be realized 3 2 4 effect of initial concentration of phenol the effect of initial concentration over a range from 10 to 100 ppm is illustrated in fig 10 b a decrease in the degradation efficiency with increase in the initial concentration of phenol for the zno ac catalyst could be noticed as expected the degradation is complete with low concentration of phenol while the conversion is lower for high initial concentrations with the increase of initial concentration the degradation load increases and hence an overall reduction in the conversion efficiency although the kinetics of degradation was expected to be faster with increase in the initial concentration the higher overall load contributed to an overall lower degradation the rate of degradation was extremely fast at short durations while it tended to get slower significantly at long durations fast reaction at short duration could be attributed to the concentration driving force for reaction as well as the mass transfer both factors possibly contributed to high rates of degradation 3 3 reaction kinetics kinetics study is essential to evaluate the performance of a given catalyst and to understand the reaction mechanism simple first order and second order kinetic model was applied for various initial phenol concentration system basic equations of first order model expressed in differential and integrated form are shown in eq s 2 and 3 28 the differential and integrated from of equations for second order model are expressed in eqs 4 and 5 2 d c d t k 1 c 3 c t c 0 e k 1 t 4 d c d t k 2 c 2 5 1 c t 1 c 0 k 2 t where c0 is the initial concentration of phenol mg l ct is phenol centration at time t mg l k1 is apparent kinetic rate constant min 1 for first order model and k2 is apparent kinetic rate constant of second order reaction kinetics l mol min kinetic parameters of each model k1 and k2 were estimated by linear regression and the corresponding r2 regression coefficient are provided fig 11 a depicts the first order kinetic model of phenol degradation the derived kinetic constant k1 are 0 0228 0 0072 0 0055 and 0 0046 for 10 ppm 20 ppm 50 ppm and 100 ppm respectively with a corresponding r2 of 0 9262 0 9631 0 9973 and 0 9872 apart from the degradation kinetics of 10 ppm solution first order model was suitable for the photocatalytic degradation on zno ac composite a second order kinetic model plot for phenol removal using zno ac is displayed in fig 11b and the derived kinetic constant k2 are 0 3518 0 0017 0 0003 and 0 0001 for 10 ppm 20 ppm 50 ppm and 100 ppm solution respectively with an r2 of 0 6386 0 8333 0 9637 and 0 9949 the degradation kinetics for 50 ppm and 100 ppm agrees well with second order model whereas second order model is not suitable to interpret 10 ppm and 20 ppm kinetics the parameters of two kinetic models for phenol degradation by zno ac composite are tabulated in table 2 overall the reaction kinetics values showed a better fit with first order reaction model the value of r2 indicate that phenol degradation using zno ac composite at initial concentration lower than 100 ppm fits better to the first order kinetic model 50 mg l whereas degradation rate at initial concentration 100 ppm showed good agreement with second order model r2 value 0 9949 the observed shift to second order kinetics at high concentrations could originate from the degradation mechanism transformation or combination of several mechanisms in the reaction phenol removal efficiency during the first 10 min seemed to be dominated by adsorption in the carbon matrix while the removal at high initial concentration takes place in a step wise manner with respect to time the trend of reaction kinetics varied depending on the initial concentration of phenolic solution this kinetic model transformation is similarly observed on dye degradation by carbon supported photocatalytic composite reported in a recent publication 24 with regards to decreasing tendency of rate constant with increase of initial concentration limited accessibility of phenol on active sites might be the possible explanation elevated adsorbate concentration on the active sites of composite leads to competitive adsorption between organic molecules or even with generated hydroxyl radicals on active sites excess concentration on the surface could also hinder the absorbance of photons by catalyst leading the stated tendency similar trend and explanation for the mechanism were reported in several articles earlier 24 29 3 4 comparison of present work with previous studies table 3 compares the adsorption data from the present work with the literature utilizing composite catalyst phenol degradation study by fatimah et al 30 tried to impregnate zno nanoparticles wurtzite on the activated carbon photocatalytic degradation effect was tested with 5 g l catalyst dosage at 10 ppm of initial phenol concentration solution and 80 of degradation was achieved in an hour such high catalyst dosage is hard to be accepted from economic sense however a conversion efficiency of 88 could be achieved within one hour duration as demonstrated in the present work with a catalyst dosage of 1 g l this could be attributed to the enhanced functionality by crystallizing rod like zinc oxide on the carbon surface on the other hand there were diverse trials to degrade phenol by titanium supported by carbon matrix recent attempt by abussaud et al 8 with tio2 activated carbon catalyst have reported 89 degradation in 120 min with 2 ppm phenol solution at ph 7 at 298 k the functionality of the catalyst entirely arises from adsorption as there was no light source the reported degradation efficiency could be purely due to adsorption and not due to degradation due to lack of uv radiation since the initial concentration was 2 ppm high removal with activated carbon was feasible another attempt by matos et al 31 reported mixing effect of tio2 p25 and activated carbon with catalyst ratio tio2 ac 5 1 under the condition of 125 w high pressure mercury lamp 3 g l dosage and 94 ppm of the initial concentration for 180 min high dosage of powder type tio2 contributed to complete degradation this system however seems to have limitations that emulsified tio2 should be recovered and tio2 ratio in the mixture should remain high to adapt in adsorption unit the present work showed 74 degradation at an initial concentration of 100 ppm in 180 min and reduced the catalyst dosage to one third of 1 g l and illuminate lower voltage light source of 8 1 w which is over 10 times less than 125 w while preventing the emulsification of photocatalyst powder in the solution and making the catalyst recovery easier 3 5 phenol degradation mechanism on zno ac composite the mechanism of phenolic degradation with the zno ac composite consisted of two stages with the first stage being dominated by adsorption while the second stage being reaction dominated at first there are mainly four steps involved in adsorption process including external mass transfer so called bulk transfer film resistance internal diffusion and adsorption at active site 32 considering the experiments were conducted with good stirring mass transfer could possibly be limited only by the diffusion resistance followed by the adsorption on active sites on the other hand photocatalytic degradation of phenol involves three major steps including adsorption of organic molecule light absorption and charge transfer to generate active radicals to degrade the molecule 33 to get good photocatalytic degradation strengthened adsorption minimal hindrance for light absorption and smooth charge transfer are essential zno ac shows good degradation rate on phenol possibly due to synergetic effect of carbon matrix and zno photocatalyst the existence of activated carbon enhances the adsorption capacity and allows the smooth supply of phenol to the active sites in situ regeneration of activated carbon could be also possible as adsorbed phenol is degraded by photocatalytic reaction instead of remaining on the surface however further research is required to get an elaborated idea of overall degradation mechanism 4 conclusions photocatalytic degradation efficiency of phenol by tio2 ac and zno ac catalysts were investigated to assess the suitability to wastewater treatment system tio2 ac and zno ac composites were successfully synthesized via hydrothermal method using activated carbon and metal oxide precursors various techniques including sem edx xrd ftir and bet analysis used to characterize the synthesized tio2 ac and zno ac revealed that titanium dioxide and zinc oxide were evenly distributed on the carbon surface and clear crystalline zinc oxide with shape of rod was observed for zno ac further ftir analysis confirmed the presence of functional groups on the composite surface zno ac composite and tio2 ac composite proved enhanced degradation efficiency than activated carbon matrix alone in phenol degradation study under uv irradiation for 240 min as compared to tio2 ac zno ac composite exhibited higher degradation efficiency under identical conditions the effects of duration catalyst dosage and initial concentration of phenol were tested to identify optimal operating condition of zno ac accordingly the highest efficiency was recorded at the maximum of duration of experiment in the present study 240 min for all catalysts and an increase in the catalyst dosage was found to increase the degradation efficiency kinetic studies with the selected zno ac catalyst was interpreted using first order and second order reaction models phenol degradation at lower initial concentrations 100 ppm showed a better fit with the first order kinetic model whereas the degradation at higher initial concentrations followed second order model based on overall results synergetic effect of adsorption and photocatalytic degradation on zno ac composite improved the phenol removal efficiency the applied experiment condition of room temperature neutral ph condition and low level of initial concentration reflected the real wastewater treatment condition so that the results can be extended to the industrial application comparison of present work with literature revealed that the synthesized zno ac exhibited significantly improved functionality synthesized zno ac didn t compromise the degradation efficiency while eliminated the emulsified nature of nano sized commercial photo catalyst by embedding on the carbon surface acknowledgement the authors would like to extend their sincere appreciation to center for membrane and advanced water technology cmat khalifa university for providing

14354,the present work evaluated the influence of the filling substrate material the presence of plants and position of plant species on the saturation and hydrodynamic behavior in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands hssf cws for this six hssf cws were used which differed with regards to the type of substrate gneiss gravel or crushed pet bottles presence of plant species and their position consortium between tifton 85 grass and elephant grass for the treatment of wastewater from a milk cooling tank wwmt it was observed that there was a higher solids concentration and a greater extent of runoff in hssf cws cultivated and filled with gravel after one year and eight months of operation which was due the contribution of solids resulting from substrate wear and the presence of the root entanglement crushed pet bottles may be a viable alternative substrate in hssf cws because they are inert present low wear and contribute fewer to pore clogging solids it was observed that the sequence of plant species also influenced the runoff length having greater extent of surface flow in units with elephant grass followed by tifton 85 grass despite the higher solids concentration and greater surface flow the beds filled with gravel and cultivated with the plants showed better hydrodynamic conditions than the other treatments which indicates the importance of analyzing the characteristics of the solids and the effect of pore space expansion by the roots keywords dairy wastewater substrate wear crushed pet bottles clogging solids 1 introduction in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands hssf cws there occur simultaneous and controlled chemical physical and biological processes involving plant growth substrate and microorganisms for the treatment of wastewater and polluted waters 1 this type of system is especially suitable for implantation where there is little capital available for investment compared to that required for conventional systems and mechanized treatment of effluents due to its low costs of implantation maintenance and operation as well as the potential for using the plant matter produced for animal feed or other purposes 1 3 however the same processes that treat wastewater can contribute to the main operational problem of these systems which is clogging of the substrate porous medium and depending on constructive and operational aspects hssf cws are more or less subject to this phenomenon among the factors identified as possible causes of clogging kadlec and wallace 2 knowles et al 4 paoli and von sperling 5 miranda et al 6 miranda et al 7 and matos et al 8 indicated the deposition of organic and inorganic solids on the surface formation of chemical precipitates growth of biofilm and development of plant roots and rhizomes in the porous material bed as the factors that most contribute to the process of obstruction of porous spaces in hssf cws matos et al 9 added that the conditions of ph redox potential and chemical constitution can contribute to wear crumbling of the substrate further reducing the drainable porosity in these systems to reduce the construction costs of hssf cws the use of alternative substrates has been proposed favoring the utilization of materials found at the site or those disposable this is the case of pet bottles which are currently considered an environmental problem with regards to final disposal dallas and ho 10 studied the efficiency of hssf cws filled with pet bottles cut into two or three parts depending on bottle size and gneiss gravel and found that the first substrate provided better results of nutrient pollutant removal from the wastewater under treatment in addition to reducing costs of hssf cw construction by 50 when compared to gravel sklarz et al 11 using plastic beads porosity of 0 8 m³ m 3 similar to that of mashed pet bottles obtained an average biochemical oxygen demand bod5 removal efficiency of 95 for the treatment of domestic sewage in addition the plastic material is less reactive and less amenable to wear which may imply longer lifetimes of the hssf cws compared to the commonly used media carriers as gneiss gravel the contribution of plants in the hssf cw clogging process is a controversial subject that has been studied and discussed by several authors according to knowles et al 4 pedescoll et al 12 and miranda et al 7 plants contribute to the saturation of hssf cws which is due to the growth of rhizomes and roots and dead organic matter produced by plant senescence which can lead to a reduction in hydraulic conductivity appearance of short circuits and surface runoff in the system on the other hand authors such as cooper et al 13 and matos et al 14 argued that roots favor the flow of wastewater in the bed counteracting the effects of clogging the influence of the plants was previously evaluated with regards to the removal of pollutants 15 16 the microbial community 17 and the accumulation of solids 18 however little is known on the effect of a species consortium in the cw matos et al 19 did not find a significant difference in the cod degradation kinetics when comparing cws cultivated in monoculture with those presented mixed cultivation with the presence of three species on the other hand button et al 20 found promising results with the use of cws in series two to two in which two species were cultivated in consortium one in each cw according to the authors selection of the species and their combination may influence the microbial community and efficiency of the treatment systems thus there may also be an effect on the flow conditions and the accumulation of solids in cws the present study therefore sought to evaluate the influence of substrate wear and the presence and cultivation position of two plant species on the clogging process and the hydrodynamic behavior in hssf cws used for treatment of wastewater from a common tank utilized for dairy milk cooling 2 material and methods the experiment consisted of six hssf cws prototypes fig 1 constructed of masonry with dimensions of 0 6 m high x 1 0 m wide x 2 5 m long positioned on the ground with the bottom level and sides impermeabilized with a 0 5 mm thick sheet of pvc mounted in parallel and delimited by masonry walls the units evaluated had been in operation since april 2015 for the treatment of wastewater from a common milk cooling tank wwmt the hssf cws were filled with gneiss gravel d60 9 1 mm coefficient of uniformity cu d60 d10 3 1 and initial porosity n 0 398 m³ m 3 and crushed pet bottles 250 and 500 ml n 0 642 m3 m 3 in the hssf cws filled with crushed pet bottles a plastic screen 13 mm mesh was placed on top of the substrate and a 0 10 m gravel layer was placed above this screen in order to prevent the pet bottles from floating in the system the plant species cultivated in the hssf cws were elephant grass cv napier pennisetum purpureum schum and tifton 85 cynodon spp each of which occupied half the surface of these systems the cultivation order varied according to the established treatment the wwmt generated in the tank sanitization was conducted to a reservoir with volume of 1000 l from which it was distributed to individual feed containers 200 l volume of each hssf cw fig 1 a the influent distribution occurred at the central point at the inlet to each hssf cw through a ½ inch plastic tap and at which the influent flow was controlled each bed was fed a flow rate of 0 18 m3 d 1 and a mean organic loading rate of 33 7 g m 2 d 1 of bod5 the wwmt depth in all hssf cws was maintained at 0 35 m providing a nominal or theoretical hydraulic retention time hrtn of 3 0 and 1 9 d respectively in the hssf cws filled with crushed pet bottles and gneiss gravel fig 1 b shows the frontal and longitudinal sections of the hssf cws where it is possible to observe that in all cws the substrate is filled to a depth of 0 45 m in the hssf cws filled with crushed pet bottles a 0 10 m layer of gneiss gravel was placed on the 0 35 m layer of crushed pet bottles it should be noted that because the water level was maintained at 0 10 m below the surface in both hssf cws the wet height in both systems was 0 35 m in the experiment the treatments were as follows hssf cws filled with the crushed pet bottles substrate without plant cultivation cw p cultivated in its first half with tifton 85 grass and in its second half with elephant grass cw pte and cultivated in its first half with elephant grass and in its second half with tifton 85 grass cw pet hssf cws filled with gneiss gravel substrate without plant cultivation cw b cultivated in its first half with tifton 85 grass and in its second half with elephant grass cw bte and cultivated in its first half with elephant grass and second half with tifton 85 grass cw bet the treatments evaluated are summarized in table 1 the experiment was in operation for one year and eight months and monitoring of the advance in wwmt surface runoff flow on the substrate surface was performed for eight months and began after one year of operating the systems to assess the degree of clogging along the hssf cws this was performed once a month using a measuring tape to determine the advance in surface water length as performed by miranda et al 7 the quantification and characterization of solids present in the porous medium of the hssf cws were performed at the end of experimental monitoring after one year and eight months of operation because the sample collection method was invasive and caused a change to the system conditions sampling of the porous medium was performed according to miranda et al 7 as follows in each experimental unit a previous drainage of all wastewater present in hssf cw beds b collection of two substrate samples together with solids retained in their interstices for each hssf cws 20 cm from the inlet and outlet for this a metal cylinder measuring 30 cm in diameter and 60 cm in height was inserted into the bed and all material contained therein was removed manually c storage of collected material in plastic bags properly identified and taken for analysis at the laboratory of soils and solid wastes of the department of agricultural engineering ufv d washing of the substrate using a maximum volume of 2 0 l of distilled water to remove most of the adhered organic material a plastic sieve with 1 3 mm opening was used to facilitate the substrate washing process e placing the suspensions generated from washing of each substrate sample in 2 l plastic containers and oven dried at 65 c f after dry the samples were ground using a mortar and passed through a 0 212 mm mesh sieve after these procedures the following analyses were performed on the dry matter total solids content ts obtained by the gravimetric method total volatile solids tvs and total fixed solids tfs obtained after material calcination in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 2 h these analyzes allow to evaluate the presence of accumulated solids in the pores of the hssf cw and which main constituent fixed or volatile solids allowing to discuss the mechanisms that contribute to the clogging plant influence and wear of the support material to infer about the possible interference of the roots in the clogging process these plant structures were carefully separated from the accumulated solids measuring the extension with the use of a measure tap to monitor the clogging process and hydrodynamic conditions of the hssf cws a test was performed using a flow tracer before the bed solids extraction this test was conducted after one year and eight months of operation in all hssf cws cultivated and uncultivated the tracer selected for the test was lithium chloride because of its ease of analysis the fact that it does not degrade and good recovery in execution of the assay 21 to calculate the lithium chloride mass to be added in the hssf cws the background concentration in the influent considered zero the detection limit of the equipment curve and the peak concentration of the desired tracer were considered using eq 1 1 m c vw where m is the tracer mass to be added mg c is the peak concentration mg l 1 and vw is the working volume of the reactor l the maximum detection limit of the calibration curve was 0 2 mg l 1 and peak concentrations were estimated based on the working volume since the hssf cws filled with gravel and crushed pet bottles had different working volumes for this reason 212 g and 342 g masses of lithium chloride were applied to the hssf cws filled with gravel and crushed pet bottles respectively to produce a peak concentration of 100 mg l 1 in order to recover as much tracer as possible monitoring should be done for a minimum of 3 4 times the hrtn 21 and for this reason the test was performed over the course of 14 days application of the solution prepared with the previously calculated tracer mass was performed in pulses totaling 10 min of application once the pulse was applied samples of the effluent were collected and stored in small plastic bottles for subsequent reading of the li concentration in the samples using a flame photometer celm 180 the sampling frequency which ceased when the lithium concentration could no longer be detected in the effluent varied as follows from day 1 to day 4 sampling every 2 h from day 5 to day 11 sampling every 4 h and from the 11th to the 14th day every 12 h to reduce the interference of rainfall on the measurement a roof covered with a tarp was installed over the system for calculation of the variables characterizing the hydrodynamic conditions in the hfss cws the hrtn the mean hydraulic retention time htrm 22 volumetric efficiency ve 2 hydraulic efficiency λ 23 dispersion number d and number of tanks in series n 24 and short circuit index sci and morril index mi 22 were used in eqs 2 9 respectively which are presented in table 2 the mean flow rate was used in the calculations in order to diminish the effects that water loss evaporation and transpiration can cause on the hrtn values 3 results and discussion 3 1 visual identification of surface runoff in the hssf cws fig 2 shows the monitoring of the distance traveled by wwmt surface runoff in the hssf cws by measuring its extension it was observed that after one year and eight months starting operation of the hssf cws only the cw p filled with crushed pet bottles and uncultivated did not show surface runoff during the experimental period from april 2015 to december 2016 it was also verified that surface flow occurred mainly in the first centimeters from inlet of the systems in which the input of organic material is greater and there is less exposure of the wwmt from the center to outlet of the cws according to pedescoll et al 18 the upper part of the porous medium especially in the inlet zone of the hssf cws clogs faster since it forms the first filter for solids of the applied wastewater likewise matos et al 9 verified that clogging of the hssf cws is gradual with more critical conditions near the entrance because this region receives the higher organic load fig 2 shows the absence of runoff in the cw p however in the other beds the liquid occupied about 16 26 26 44 and 15 of the total length of the cw pte cw pet cw bte cw bet and cw b respectively it was verified that the hssf cws filled with crushed pet bottles presented during the entire monitoring period less runoff than those filled with gravel based on this it was inferred that greater surface runoff in the gravel filled hssf cws is due to wear of the substrate material with reduction of the particle diameter in the substrate and increased solids accumulation in the beds reduction of drainable porosity as well as the formation of a dense root layer similarly miranda et al 6 also observed greater extension of surface runoff in cultivated hssf cws used for the treatment of swine wastewater in gravel filled beds measured runoff lengths were equivalent to 13 18 and 65 respectively in the systems without cultivation cultivated with tifton grass and cultivated with alternanthera the uncultivated systems cw p and cw b presented less surface runoff when compared to cultivated systems it can thus be inferred that the plants are a probable source of organic matter deposits to the porous medium although only superficial resulting from plant senescence with fall of leaves and death of other plant components 6 pedescoll et al 12 also verified that the roots and rhizomes of the plants can contribute to clogging of the porous medium in the first centimeters of the superficial layer of the bed paoli and von sperling et al 5 observed that surface runoff in cultivated hssf cws was approximately 25 of the bed length whereas in the uncultured hssf cw it was only 8 5 of the length from its start in addition the authors found evidence of the formation of preferential paths in the cultivated hssf cws and attributed this fact to the different dynamics in accumulation of solids between the two systems due to the presence of roots debris or the root system itself the systems cultivated with elephant grass followed by tifton 85 grass cw pet and cw bet were those that showed the greatest runoff and it can be inferred that the type and cultivation sequence of the plant species can influence the clogging process of hssf cws however it should be noted that the presence of wastewater on the surface especially in cultivated hssf cws is not indicative of the reduction in wwmt treatment efficiency corroborating with this study vymazal 25 also observed no significant effect of clogging and consequent surface runoff in hssf cws in operation for more than 20 years on the quality of wastewater under treatment likewise matos et al 9 compiled works in which it was not possible to verify efficiency losses in cws in advanced stages of fouling in one of these studies surface runoff reached 90 of bed extension with no evidence of loss of efficiency 26 3 2 root development in the hssf cws in the hssf cws with porous medium composed of gneiss gravel and crushed pet bottles there was the formation of a root carpet that covered part of the subsurface of the systems which extended to a depth of 25 cm this was observed in both those cultivated with elephant grass in which there is the formation of clumps on the surface and with tifton 85 grass in which there is prostrate growth of the plants some authors identified the presence of this layer in hssf cws with thickness varying from 10 to 30 cm 4 7 root entanglement in the porous medium provided better conditions for sedimentation filtration of suspended solids and the development of microorganisms improving the treatment efficiency in cultivated hssf cws cw pet and cw bet 27 however the formation of a solid and compact layer composed of adhered organic material was observed mainly on the surface of the roots 0 15 cm complicating disintegration miranda et al 7 studying hssf cws cultivated with tifton 85 grass and alternanthera also verified the presence of a compact layer in which there was a vertical distribution gradient of the solids with greater accumulation in the layer near the surface similarly nguyen 28 used a cultivated hssf cw to verify that the majority of organic matter accumulated in the 10 cm surface layer originated from the death of roots and rhizomes exudation of organic compounds from the roots and the large amount of biomass and microbial activity in the bed the authors estimated that approximately 27 of pore blockage in this layer was due to the presence of plant roots and rhizomes 73 was caused by organic deposits from applied wastewater and debris from the aerial part of the plants and only 4 of pore blockage was due to inorganic deposits to evaluate root development in the porous medium the depths of their reach were measured in the hssf cws table 1 it was noted that in systems filled with gravel the tifton 85 and elephant grass presented greater growth than those filled with crushed pet bottles due mainly to the physical impediment of the screen which as previously reported was placed at 10 cm from the top of the pet filled systems also observed was the dense root growth of both grass species forming dense rhizospheres notably in the top 10 cm from the surface of the substrates 3 3 solids present in samples removed from the hssf cws the amount of solids retained per unit volume of substrate in kg m 3 quantified in samples collected in the 0 15 cm and 15 45 cm layers of the cultured systems 20 cm from the inlet l1 and 20 cm of the outlet of the systems l2 are presented in table 2 in the uncultured systems only composite samples were collected considering that there were no major differences along the entire profile much has been discussed regarding the actual interference of the substrate in clogging of hssf cws especially with regard to its potential wear from the data presented in table 2 a great difference can be verified regarding the amount of solids present in systems filled with gravel in relation to those filled with crushed pet bottles it was observed that the cw b presented in positions l1 and l2 respectively 2 21 and 2 86 times more solids per bed volume than the cw p concerning the planted systems greater differences were verified in the deepest layer 15 45 cm of the substrate obtaining solids retention 6 04 and 9 75 times greater in bte than in pte and 5 55 and 8 50 times in bet than in pet respectively for l1 and l2 positions thus it can be stated that the wear of gneiss gravel caused a greater difference in the amount of solids removed from the systems table 3 shows the mean fs ts and vs ts ratios in the solid material of all hssf cws taking into consideration the different substrates gravel and crushed pet bottles and the two positions 1 and 2 collected at 20 cm from the inlet and 20 cm from the outlet of the hssf cws characterization of the porous medium clogging material indicated that it was primarily composed of fixed solids differing significantly both in relation to the different substrates gravel or crushed pet bottles and in relation to the collection positions l1 and l2 a greater presence of fs ts was observed in the hssf cws filled with gravel which may be associated with its wear similarly pedescoll et al 29 found that the inorganic solids associated with clogging had a mineral composition analogous to that of the filter material which may be due to the formation of acids bound to the biochemical pathways of organic matter removal promoting dissolution and disintegration of the granular medium 30 caselles osorio et al 31 also verified that more than 80 of the clogging solids are inorganic matos et al 8 analyzed the clogging material accumulated in hssf cws filled with blast furnace slag and observed that 80 of the solids were inorganic of which 82 resulted from wear of the support medium in addition to the data presented in table 2 in which the highest proportion of solids was verified in hssf cws filled with gravel it was observed that the use of the substrate of crushed pet bottles decreases the proportion of inorganic solids in the medium since they are made with materials that will not suffer wear such as gneiss gravel and it may prolong the start of the clogging process in hssf cws also according to the data presented in table 3 it was observed that the accumulation of inorganic solids increased as moving away from the system inlet based on the higher fs ts values in position l2 near the hssf cws outlet in relation to l1 hssf cws inlet the same was observed by miranda et al 7 and matos et al 8 consequently the amount of organic material retained in the substrate decreased as moving away from the system inlet where the vs ts ratio at l1 was 2 6 times higher than at l2 paoli and von sperling 32 when evaluating hssf cws filled with blast furnace slag performed the characterization and distribution of solids present along the filter medium of the systems obtaining volatile solids values of 30 and 36 at the inlet of these systems and 7 and 14 at 18 5 m from the input respectively in samples of material accumulated in the pores in both uncultivated hssf cws and those with plants this condition is also found in other studies with hssf cw because there is a trend to have higher applied organic load at the inlet zone having decrease of the concentration of organic matter along the length of the beds of this same treatment system 33 miranda et al 6 studied the behavior of hssf cws filled with gneiss gravel and cultivated with alternanthera and tifton 85 grass for the treatment of swine wastewater in operation for a period of 2 years and 6 months at the end of this period the hssf cws were clogged and presented 26 cm 35 cm and 130 cm of runoff respectively in uncultivated systems and in those cultivated with tifton 85 grass and alternanthera the same authors found vs ts ratios of 6 16 and 19 respectively in the uncultivated system and those cultivated with tifton 85 grass and alternanthera while the same systems presented fs ts ratios of 94 84 and 81 respectively therefore it is inferred that in relation to non inert substrates about 80 of the solids are fixed this ratio is reduced with the use of inert materials with a clear contribution of material wear on system clogging 3 4 evaluation of clogging using the tracer test the response curves concentration versus time obtained in the tests using the tracer licl in all hssf cws are shown in fig 3 it can be observed that the maximum tracer concentration obtained in the hssf cws filled with crushed pet bottles unexpectedly was greater than 100 mg l 1 it is believed that this occurred due to the porosity value considered the same that was found by saraiva et al 27 in calculating the lithium mass to be applied eq 1 however new tests were carried out and it was observed that the porosity value of the medium composed of crushed pet bottles varied mainly due to the different sizes of the crushed bottles in addition there may have been some accommodation of the material with the weight of gravel placed on the top layer differing from the value quantified by saraiva et al 27 in the laboratory based on these conditions the void volume of the bed would be smaller than estimated causing the passage of a tracer cloud with a concentration greater than that established 100 mg l 1 in the same figure it is possible to notice that all curves present a tail according to levenspiel 24 and borges et al 34 the tail effect occurs due to the mobility of the tracer in the porous medium diffusing in dead zones and absorbing in the substrate of the systems resulting from surface retention or hydraulic short circuits guo et al 35 evaluated the hydrodynamics of three hssf cws and attributed the tail effect to the existence of dead zones and mixing resulting in slow recovery of the tracer which was also observed by magalhães filho et al 36 and matos et al 14 thus these oscillations in the tracer concentration curve occurred due to the occasional salt retention and release in hssf cws for barca et al 37 there are two flow paths into a filter such as into hssf cw a main that represents the main peak and secondary flow path that leads to long tails in the first path the liquid would flow through the central part of the filter passing rapidly while in the secondary path the liquid would pass through dead zones or slow exchange having high hydraulic retention time which would explain the curves found in the tracer passage values of the hydrodynamic parameters obtained by means of the tracer test performed in the hssf cws are presented in table 4 the tracer mass recovered in the hydrodynamic assay in all systems was greater than 85 which maintains the integrity of the assay as was established by headley and kadlec 21 this high percentage of lithium recovery was expected since it is not absorbed by the plants the hrtn calculated varied with respect to the hssf cws filled with gravel and those with crushed pet bottles in the hssf cws filled with gravel both cultivated and uncultivated the hrtm was greater than the hrtn contrary to the expectation since was observed the surface flow at the inlet to the beds which would indicates a possible obstruction of the pore space it is understood that this was not observed due to the interference of two joint processes trapping of the tracer in dead zones and effluent flow variations caused by evaporation evapotranspiration in the systems this can also be credited to the fact that porosity measured in the laboratory is potentially different from that found in the field due to material settling influence of root growth and substrate swelling in the hssf cws according to suliman et al 38 the use of reactive substrates intensifies the formation of precipitates and contributes to rapid pore media obstruction also forming a retention nucleus of other solids enhancing the clogging process gneiss gravel is more reative than crushed pet bottles retaining and further delaying the passage of the tracer which influences the evaluation of hrt on the other hand in the hssf cws with porous media composed of crushed pet bottles the hrtm was lower than the hrtn therefore indicating greater clogging of these systems it was again speculated that there is a relationship with the considered porosity which as discussed previously which may have been overestimated besides that these results do not corroborate with what was observed visually in the monitoring of clogging in hssf cws due to the absence of runoff in the cw p fig 2 as well as the large difference in the amount of solids withdrawn from the systems table 2 which would lead to greater clogging in systems with the gravel substrate one hypothesis to explain the contrasting results is based on the characteristics of the solids which is more important than the quantity with regards to the obstruction of porous systems 29 31 37 despite the greater amount of clogging solids present in the beds filled with gravel they consist of a larger proportion of inorganic solids which occupy less volume than the organic solids according to matos et al 8 the latter have a specific mass nine times smaller than the fs additionally because the gravel has a larger surface area for biofilm formation a good portion of the solids may be adhered while in beds composed of crushed pet bottles they would be predominantly interstitial in theory the hssf cws filled with gravel should present worse conditions in the initial section of the bed in comparison with hssf cws filled with crushed pet bottles because the amount of solids present would compensate the higher proportion of fs in these beds which is sufficient to cause greater obstruction of the porous space in regions farther from the inlet of the hssf cws where the solids content in the two beds is reduced the organic solids present in greater proportion in the bed with crushed pet bottles which are theoretically mostly interstitial what would cause poorer hydrodynamic conditions to these units matos et al 14 observed better hydrodynamic conditions in a cultivated hssf cw compared to a similar uncultivated system even under conditions of increased surface water at the inlet of the system the authors argued that the roots can more effectively influence the increase in porosity in areas farther from the inlet where the accumulation of solids is lower near the wastewater inlet to the cw these plant structures appear to have a more prominent role in increasing the retention of solids reducing the drainable porosity this hypothesis could explain why the hssf cws with elephant grass the plant with the highest root growth table 1 in the first half of the bed where there is greater supply of organic matter and greater vs ts ratio table 3 presented a greater extension of surface flow fig 1 however at the same time they are not the units with the worst hydrodynamic conditions in hydrodynamic studies in real and simulated systems persson et al 23 found values of λ ranging from 0 11 to 0 90 according to the authors systems with λ above 0 75 present good hydraulic conditions and λ values lower than 0 50 represent low hydraulic efficiency it was observed that all the hssf cws evaluated in this study presented low hydraulic efficiency where the smallest values were found in hssf cws filled with crushed pet bottles however it was not possible to observe differences between cultivated and uncultivated hssf cws matos et al 14 evaluating the hydrodynamic conditions of hssf cws in operation for 7 years cultivated and uncultivated also observed low hydraulic efficiency in the systems borges et al 34 determined the hydraulic efficiency of three hssf cws of the same size 24 0 m x 1 0 m x 0 35 m finding values between 0 87 and 1 10 these high values were attributed among other factors to the geometry of the units which presented a length width ratio of 24 1 in terms of volumetric efficiency a value of 1 0 indicates the use of the entire volume available for flow and values greater than or less than 1 0 indicate inefficiency in use of the porous volume 22 in this study values less than one were obtained for the hssf cws filled with crushed pet bottles where the values of ve in the cultivated hssf cws were 0 8 and 0 7 respectively in the cw pte and cw pet with lower volumetric efficiencies than in the uncultivated system cw p in the cw p a value of 0 9 was obtained indicating greater clogging in the cultivated hssf cws similarly paoli and von sperling 32 studied hssf cws after 2 years of operation and by means of a radioactive tracer 82br found that the cultivated cw was more clogged presenting a ve value of 0 89 compared to 0 97 in the uncultivated unit however in the hssf cws with porous medium composed of gravel the volumetric efficiency values exceeded one an unexpected result in the present work and there is no trend between planted and non planted units according to metcalf and eddy 22 mi values near 1 indicate piston flow and values close to 22 indicate a complete mixing regime in this study systems filled with crushed pet bottles presented mi values ranging from 49 to 84 indicating complete mixing magalhães filho et al 36 working with hssf cws and high flow rates 1 14 l min 1 also found a high mi value 81 71 contrarily in hssf cws filled with gravel the mi ranged from 5 to 9 indicating piston flow alcocer et al 39 demonstrated that finer porous media induce a hydraulic behaviour closer to an ideal plug flow system corroborating the hydraulic behavior in these hssf cws sci values equal to zero indicate completely mixed flow while values smaller than 1 0 indicate the presence of short circuits based on these conditions it was possible to observe that all hssf cws evaluated in this study presented sci values close to zero characterized as high dispersion beds d 0 25 and low n value 22 matos et al 14 also observed a high dispersion in hssf cws but lower than those recorded in this study with d of 0 16 and 0 32 in the cultivated system and 0 14 in the uncultivated system matos et al 40 obtained d values in hssf cw unplanted prototypes with different aspect ratio lenght width l w from 0 09 and 0 13 within the moderate dispersion range 0 025 d 0 20 as established by kadlec and wallace 2 the d values obtained are according to those reported in other authors 0 08 33 0 19 for unplanted systems and between 0 14 to 0 31 for planted systems 41 in unplanted hssf cws pedescoll et al 18 obtained a d of 0 35 in prototypes of l w 1 6 1 cultivating phragmites australis małoszewski et al 42 obtained a d of 0 14 in the autumn and 0 06 in the summer in hssf cw prototypes of l w 0 31 1 while pedescoll et al 18 obtained 0 14 in hssf cw prototypes of l w 1 6 1 seeger et al 43 0 11 in hssf cws of l w 4 5 1 garcia 44 obtained 0 18 and 0 18 in hssf cw pairs of l w 1 1 0 12 to 0 07 in l w pairs of 1 5 1 and 0 08 and 0 05 in l w pairs of 2 1 it was noted that in the first few hours of the experiment a significant quantity of lithium was rapidly conducted out of the unit resulting in the maximum tracer peak the remainder exited slowly over the course of the evaluation period it was verified that these multiple factors are in agreement with the high intensity dispersion model and with strong tendency to flow with a high degree of mixture with the hydrodynamic study it was possible to analyze that the cultivated hssf cws despite presenting greater surface runoff did not show a higher degree of clogging in the medium and this may have occurred due to the expansion of roots and rhizomes resulting in a greater void volume 4 conclusions it can be concluded that surface runoff was higher in systems containing the gravel substrate and when cultivated with plants in the systems where elephant grass was cultivated in the first half and tifton grass in the second half the highest surface runoff was observed which allows for inferring that the type and sequence of plant species may interfere on the clogging process of hssf cws the quantities of solids accumulated in the substrate of the hssf cws filled with gravel are 4 times higher than those accumulated in those filled with crushed pet bottles due to wear of the gravel the clogging solids are mostly inorganic and result from wear crumbling of the substrate however organic solids are those that most influence the occurrence of the surface runoff process in hssf cws from the hydrodynamic test it was possible to observe that all hssf cws regardless of the substrate type and form of their cultivation presented dead zones and great dispersion despite the higher solids concentration and greater surface flow the beds filled with gravel and cultivated with the plants showed better hydrodynamic conditions than the other treatments which indicates the importance of analyzing the characteristics of the solids and the effect of pore space expansion by the roots crushed pet bottles may be a viable alternative substrate in hssf cws because they are inert present low wear and contribute fewer pore clogging solids acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the brazilian agencies cnpq and epamig for their support of the research 
14354,the present work evaluated the influence of the filling substrate material the presence of plants and position of plant species on the saturation and hydrodynamic behavior in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands hssf cws for this six hssf cws were used which differed with regards to the type of substrate gneiss gravel or crushed pet bottles presence of plant species and their position consortium between tifton 85 grass and elephant grass for the treatment of wastewater from a milk cooling tank wwmt it was observed that there was a higher solids concentration and a greater extent of runoff in hssf cws cultivated and filled with gravel after one year and eight months of operation which was due the contribution of solids resulting from substrate wear and the presence of the root entanglement crushed pet bottles may be a viable alternative substrate in hssf cws because they are inert present low wear and contribute fewer to pore clogging solids it was observed that the sequence of plant species also influenced the runoff length having greater extent of surface flow in units with elephant grass followed by tifton 85 grass despite the higher solids concentration and greater surface flow the beds filled with gravel and cultivated with the plants showed better hydrodynamic conditions than the other treatments which indicates the importance of analyzing the characteristics of the solids and the effect of pore space expansion by the roots keywords dairy wastewater substrate wear crushed pet bottles clogging solids 1 introduction in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands hssf cws there occur simultaneous and controlled chemical physical and biological processes involving plant growth substrate and microorganisms for the treatment of wastewater and polluted waters 1 this type of system is especially suitable for implantation where there is little capital available for investment compared to that required for conventional systems and mechanized treatment of effluents due to its low costs of implantation maintenance and operation as well as the potential for using the plant matter produced for animal feed or other purposes 1 3 however the same processes that treat wastewater can contribute to the main operational problem of these systems which is clogging of the substrate porous medium and depending on constructive and operational aspects hssf cws are more or less subject to this phenomenon among the factors identified as possible causes of clogging kadlec and wallace 2 knowles et al 4 paoli and von sperling 5 miranda et al 6 miranda et al 7 and matos et al 8 indicated the deposition of organic and inorganic solids on the surface formation of chemical precipitates growth of biofilm and development of plant roots and rhizomes in the porous material bed as the factors that most contribute to the process of obstruction of porous spaces in hssf cws matos et al 9 added that the conditions of ph redox potential and chemical constitution can contribute to wear crumbling of the substrate further reducing the drainable porosity in these systems to reduce the construction costs of hssf cws the use of alternative substrates has been proposed favoring the utilization of materials found at the site or those disposable this is the case of pet bottles which are currently considered an environmental problem with regards to final disposal dallas and ho 10 studied the efficiency of hssf cws filled with pet bottles cut into two or three parts depending on bottle size and gneiss gravel and found that the first substrate provided better results of nutrient pollutant removal from the wastewater under treatment in addition to reducing costs of hssf cw construction by 50 when compared to gravel sklarz et al 11 using plastic beads porosity of 0 8 m³ m 3 similar to that of mashed pet bottles obtained an average biochemical oxygen demand bod5 removal efficiency of 95 for the treatment of domestic sewage in addition the plastic material is less reactive and less amenable to wear which may imply longer lifetimes of the hssf cws compared to the commonly used media carriers as gneiss gravel the contribution of plants in the hssf cw clogging process is a controversial subject that has been studied and discussed by several authors according to knowles et al 4 pedescoll et al 12 and miranda et al 7 plants contribute to the saturation of hssf cws which is due to the growth of rhizomes and roots and dead organic matter produced by plant senescence which can lead to a reduction in hydraulic conductivity appearance of short circuits and surface runoff in the system on the other hand authors such as cooper et al 13 and matos et al 14 argued that roots favor the flow of wastewater in the bed counteracting the effects of clogging the influence of the plants was previously evaluated with regards to the removal of pollutants 15 16 the microbial community 17 and the accumulation of solids 18 however little is known on the effect of a species consortium in the cw matos et al 19 did not find a significant difference in the cod degradation kinetics when comparing cws cultivated in monoculture with those presented mixed cultivation with the presence of three species on the other hand button et al 20 found promising results with the use of cws in series two to two in which two species were cultivated in consortium one in each cw according to the authors selection of the species and their combination may influence the microbial community and efficiency of the treatment systems thus there may also be an effect on the flow conditions and the accumulation of solids in cws the present study therefore sought to evaluate the influence of substrate wear and the presence and cultivation position of two plant species on the clogging process and the hydrodynamic behavior in hssf cws used for treatment of wastewater from a common tank utilized for dairy milk cooling 2 material and methods the experiment consisted of six hssf cws prototypes fig 1 constructed of masonry with dimensions of 0 6 m high x 1 0 m wide x 2 5 m long positioned on the ground with the bottom level and sides impermeabilized with a 0 5 mm thick sheet of pvc mounted in parallel and delimited by masonry walls the units evaluated had been in operation since april 2015 for the treatment of wastewater from a common milk cooling tank wwmt the hssf cws were filled with gneiss gravel d60 9 1 mm coefficient of uniformity cu d60 d10 3 1 and initial porosity n 0 398 m³ m 3 and crushed pet bottles 250 and 500 ml n 0 642 m3 m 3 in the hssf cws filled with crushed pet bottles a plastic screen 13 mm mesh was placed on top of the substrate and a 0 10 m gravel layer was placed above this screen in order to prevent the pet bottles from floating in the system the plant species cultivated in the hssf cws were elephant grass cv napier pennisetum purpureum schum and tifton 85 cynodon spp each of which occupied half the surface of these systems the cultivation order varied according to the established treatment the wwmt generated in the tank sanitization was conducted to a reservoir with volume of 1000 l from which it was distributed to individual feed containers 200 l volume of each hssf cw fig 1 a the influent distribution occurred at the central point at the inlet to each hssf cw through a ½ inch plastic tap and at which the influent flow was controlled each bed was fed a flow rate of 0 18 m3 d 1 and a mean organic loading rate of 33 7 g m 2 d 1 of bod5 the wwmt depth in all hssf cws was maintained at 0 35 m providing a nominal or theoretical hydraulic retention time hrtn of 3 0 and 1 9 d respectively in the hssf cws filled with crushed pet bottles and gneiss gravel fig 1 b shows the frontal and longitudinal sections of the hssf cws where it is possible to observe that in all cws the substrate is filled to a depth of 0 45 m in the hssf cws filled with crushed pet bottles a 0 10 m layer of gneiss gravel was placed on the 0 35 m layer of crushed pet bottles it should be noted that because the water level was maintained at 0 10 m below the surface in both hssf cws the wet height in both systems was 0 35 m in the experiment the treatments were as follows hssf cws filled with the crushed pet bottles substrate without plant cultivation cw p cultivated in its first half with tifton 85 grass and in its second half with elephant grass cw pte and cultivated in its first half with elephant grass and in its second half with tifton 85 grass cw pet hssf cws filled with gneiss gravel substrate without plant cultivation cw b cultivated in its first half with tifton 85 grass and in its second half with elephant grass cw bte and cultivated in its first half with elephant grass and second half with tifton 85 grass cw bet the treatments evaluated are summarized in table 1 the experiment was in operation for one year and eight months and monitoring of the advance in wwmt surface runoff flow on the substrate surface was performed for eight months and began after one year of operating the systems to assess the degree of clogging along the hssf cws this was performed once a month using a measuring tape to determine the advance in surface water length as performed by miranda et al 7 the quantification and characterization of solids present in the porous medium of the hssf cws were performed at the end of experimental monitoring after one year and eight months of operation because the sample collection method was invasive and caused a change to the system conditions sampling of the porous medium was performed according to miranda et al 7 as follows in each experimental unit a previous drainage of all wastewater present in hssf cw beds b collection of two substrate samples together with solids retained in their interstices for each hssf cws 20 cm from the inlet and outlet for this a metal cylinder measuring 30 cm in diameter and 60 cm in height was inserted into the bed and all material contained therein was removed manually c storage of collected material in plastic bags properly identified and taken for analysis at the laboratory of soils and solid wastes of the department of agricultural engineering ufv d washing of the substrate using a maximum volume of 2 0 l of distilled water to remove most of the adhered organic material a plastic sieve with 1 3 mm opening was used to facilitate the substrate washing process e placing the suspensions generated from washing of each substrate sample in 2 l plastic containers and oven dried at 65 c f after dry the samples were ground using a mortar and passed through a 0 212 mm mesh sieve after these procedures the following analyses were performed on the dry matter total solids content ts obtained by the gravimetric method total volatile solids tvs and total fixed solids tfs obtained after material calcination in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 2 h these analyzes allow to evaluate the presence of accumulated solids in the pores of the hssf cw and which main constituent fixed or volatile solids allowing to discuss the mechanisms that contribute to the clogging plant influence and wear of the support material to infer about the possible interference of the roots in the clogging process these plant structures were carefully separated from the accumulated solids measuring the extension with the use of a measure tap to monitor the clogging process and hydrodynamic conditions of the hssf cws a test was performed using a flow tracer before the bed solids extraction this test was conducted after one year and eight months of operation in all hssf cws cultivated and uncultivated the tracer selected for the test was lithium chloride because of its ease of analysis the fact that it does not degrade and good recovery in execution of the assay 21 to calculate the lithium chloride mass to be added in the hssf cws the background concentration in the influent considered zero the detection limit of the equipment curve and the peak concentration of the desired tracer were considered using eq 1 1 m c vw where m is the tracer mass to be added mg c is the peak concentration mg l 1 and vw is the working volume of the reactor l the maximum detection limit of the calibration curve was 0 2 mg l 1 and peak concentrations were estimated based on the working volume since the hssf cws filled with gravel and crushed pet bottles had different working volumes for this reason 212 g and 342 g masses of lithium chloride were applied to the hssf cws filled with gravel and crushed pet bottles respectively to produce a peak concentration of 100 mg l 1 in order to recover as much tracer as possible monitoring should be done for a minimum of 3 4 times the hrtn 21 and for this reason the test was performed over the course of 14 days application of the solution prepared with the previously calculated tracer mass was performed in pulses totaling 10 min of application once the pulse was applied samples of the effluent were collected and stored in small plastic bottles for subsequent reading of the li concentration in the samples using a flame photometer celm 180 the sampling frequency which ceased when the lithium concentration could no longer be detected in the effluent varied as follows from day 1 to day 4 sampling every 2 h from day 5 to day 11 sampling every 4 h and from the 11th to the 14th day every 12 h to reduce the interference of rainfall on the measurement a roof covered with a tarp was installed over the system for calculation of the variables characterizing the hydrodynamic conditions in the hfss cws the hrtn the mean hydraulic retention time htrm 22 volumetric efficiency ve 2 hydraulic efficiency λ 23 dispersion number d and number of tanks in series n 24 and short circuit index sci and morril index mi 22 were used in eqs 2 9 respectively which are presented in table 2 the mean flow rate was used in the calculations in order to diminish the effects that water loss evaporation and transpiration can cause on the hrtn values 3 results and discussion 3 1 visual identification of surface runoff in the hssf cws fig 2 shows the monitoring of the distance traveled by wwmt surface runoff in the hssf cws by measuring its extension it was observed that after one year and eight months starting operation of the hssf cws only the cw p filled with crushed pet bottles and uncultivated did not show surface runoff during the experimental period from april 2015 to december 2016 it was also verified that surface flow occurred mainly in the first centimeters from inlet of the systems in which the input of organic material is greater and there is less exposure of the wwmt from the center to outlet of the cws according to pedescoll et al 18 the upper part of the porous medium especially in the inlet zone of the hssf cws clogs faster since it forms the first filter for solids of the applied wastewater likewise matos et al 9 verified that clogging of the hssf cws is gradual with more critical conditions near the entrance because this region receives the higher organic load fig 2 shows the absence of runoff in the cw p however in the other beds the liquid occupied about 16 26 26 44 and 15 of the total length of the cw pte cw pet cw bte cw bet and cw b respectively it was verified that the hssf cws filled with crushed pet bottles presented during the entire monitoring period less runoff than those filled with gravel based on this it was inferred that greater surface runoff in the gravel filled hssf cws is due to wear of the substrate material with reduction of the particle diameter in the substrate and increased solids accumulation in the beds reduction of drainable porosity as well as the formation of a dense root layer similarly miranda et al 6 also observed greater extension of surface runoff in cultivated hssf cws used for the treatment of swine wastewater in gravel filled beds measured runoff lengths were equivalent to 13 18 and 65 respectively in the systems without cultivation cultivated with tifton grass and cultivated with alternanthera the uncultivated systems cw p and cw b presented less surface runoff when compared to cultivated systems it can thus be inferred that the plants are a probable source of organic matter deposits to the porous medium although only superficial resulting from plant senescence with fall of leaves and death of other plant components 6 pedescoll et al 12 also verified that the roots and rhizomes of the plants can contribute to clogging of the porous medium in the first centimeters of the superficial layer of the bed paoli and von sperling et al 5 observed that surface runoff in cultivated hssf cws was approximately 25 of the bed length whereas in the uncultured hssf cw it was only 8 5 of the length from its start in addition the authors found evidence of the formation of preferential paths in the cultivated hssf cws and attributed this fact to the different dynamics in accumulation of solids between the two systems due to the presence of roots debris or the root system itself the systems cultivated with elephant grass followed by tifton 85 grass cw pet and cw bet were those that showed the greatest runoff and it can be inferred that the type and cultivation sequence of the plant species can influence the clogging process of hssf cws however it should be noted that the presence of wastewater on the surface especially in cultivated hssf cws is not indicative of the reduction in wwmt treatment efficiency corroborating with this study vymazal 25 also observed no significant effect of clogging and consequent surface runoff in hssf cws in operation for more than 20 years on the quality of wastewater under treatment likewise matos et al 9 compiled works in which it was not possible to verify efficiency losses in cws in advanced stages of fouling in one of these studies surface runoff reached 90 of bed extension with no evidence of loss of efficiency 26 3 2 root development in the hssf cws in the hssf cws with porous medium composed of gneiss gravel and crushed pet bottles there was the formation of a root carpet that covered part of the subsurface of the systems which extended to a depth of 25 cm this was observed in both those cultivated with elephant grass in which there is the formation of clumps on the surface and with tifton 85 grass in which there is prostrate growth of the plants some authors identified the presence of this layer in hssf cws with thickness varying from 10 to 30 cm 4 7 root entanglement in the porous medium provided better conditions for sedimentation filtration of suspended solids and the development of microorganisms improving the treatment efficiency in cultivated hssf cws cw pet and cw bet 27 however the formation of a solid and compact layer composed of adhered organic material was observed mainly on the surface of the roots 0 15 cm complicating disintegration miranda et al 7 studying hssf cws cultivated with tifton 85 grass and alternanthera also verified the presence of a compact layer in which there was a vertical distribution gradient of the solids with greater accumulation in the layer near the surface similarly nguyen 28 used a cultivated hssf cw to verify that the majority of organic matter accumulated in the 10 cm surface layer originated from the death of roots and rhizomes exudation of organic compounds from the roots and the large amount of biomass and microbial activity in the bed the authors estimated that approximately 27 of pore blockage in this layer was due to the presence of plant roots and rhizomes 73 was caused by organic deposits from applied wastewater and debris from the aerial part of the plants and only 4 of pore blockage was due to inorganic deposits to evaluate root development in the porous medium the depths of their reach were measured in the hssf cws table 1 it was noted that in systems filled with gravel the tifton 85 and elephant grass presented greater growth than those filled with crushed pet bottles due mainly to the physical impediment of the screen which as previously reported was placed at 10 cm from the top of the pet filled systems also observed was the dense root growth of both grass species forming dense rhizospheres notably in the top 10 cm from the surface of the substrates 3 3 solids present in samples removed from the hssf cws the amount of solids retained per unit volume of substrate in kg m 3 quantified in samples collected in the 0 15 cm and 15 45 cm layers of the cultured systems 20 cm from the inlet l1 and 20 cm of the outlet of the systems l2 are presented in table 2 in the uncultured systems only composite samples were collected considering that there were no major differences along the entire profile much has been discussed regarding the actual interference of the substrate in clogging of hssf cws especially with regard to its potential wear from the data presented in table 2 a great difference can be verified regarding the amount of solids present in systems filled with gravel in relation to those filled with crushed pet bottles it was observed that the cw b presented in positions l1 and l2 respectively 2 21 and 2 86 times more solids per bed volume than the cw p concerning the planted systems greater differences were verified in the deepest layer 15 45 cm of the substrate obtaining solids retention 6 04 and 9 75 times greater in bte than in pte and 5 55 and 8 50 times in bet than in pet respectively for l1 and l2 positions thus it can be stated that the wear of gneiss gravel caused a greater difference in the amount of solids removed from the systems table 3 shows the mean fs ts and vs ts ratios in the solid material of all hssf cws taking into consideration the different substrates gravel and crushed pet bottles and the two positions 1 and 2 collected at 20 cm from the inlet and 20 cm from the outlet of the hssf cws characterization of the porous medium clogging material indicated that it was primarily composed of fixed solids differing significantly both in relation to the different substrates gravel or crushed pet bottles and in relation to the collection positions l1 and l2 a greater presence of fs ts was observed in the hssf cws filled with gravel which may be associated with its wear similarly pedescoll et al 29 found that the inorganic solids associated with clogging had a mineral composition analogous to that of the filter material which may be due to the formation of acids bound to the biochemical pathways of organic matter removal promoting dissolution and disintegration of the granular medium 30 caselles osorio et al 31 also verified that more than 80 of the clogging solids are inorganic matos et al 8 analyzed the clogging material accumulated in hssf cws filled with blast furnace slag and observed that 80 of the solids were inorganic of which 82 resulted from wear of the support medium in addition to the data presented in table 2 in which the highest proportion of solids was verified in hssf cws filled with gravel it was observed that the use of the substrate of crushed pet bottles decreases the proportion of inorganic solids in the medium since they are made with materials that will not suffer wear such as gneiss gravel and it may prolong the start of the clogging process in hssf cws also according to the data presented in table 3 it was observed that the accumulation of inorganic solids increased as moving away from the system inlet based on the higher fs ts values in position l2 near the hssf cws outlet in relation to l1 hssf cws inlet the same was observed by miranda et al 7 and matos et al 8 consequently the amount of organic material retained in the substrate decreased as moving away from the system inlet where the vs ts ratio at l1 was 2 6 times higher than at l2 paoli and von sperling 32 when evaluating hssf cws filled with blast furnace slag performed the characterization and distribution of solids present along the filter medium of the systems obtaining volatile solids values of 30 and 36 at the inlet of these systems and 7 and 14 at 18 5 m from the input respectively in samples of material accumulated in the pores in both uncultivated hssf cws and those with plants this condition is also found in other studies with hssf cw because there is a trend to have higher applied organic load at the inlet zone having decrease of the concentration of organic matter along the length of the beds of this same treatment system 33 miranda et al 6 studied the behavior of hssf cws filled with gneiss gravel and cultivated with alternanthera and tifton 85 grass for the treatment of swine wastewater in operation for a period of 2 years and 6 months at the end of this period the hssf cws were clogged and presented 26 cm 35 cm and 130 cm of runoff respectively in uncultivated systems and in those cultivated with tifton 85 grass and alternanthera the same authors found vs ts ratios of 6 16 and 19 respectively in the uncultivated system and those cultivated with tifton 85 grass and alternanthera while the same systems presented fs ts ratios of 94 84 and 81 respectively therefore it is inferred that in relation to non inert substrates about 80 of the solids are fixed this ratio is reduced with the use of inert materials with a clear contribution of material wear on system clogging 3 4 evaluation of clogging using the tracer test the response curves concentration versus time obtained in the tests using the tracer licl in all hssf cws are shown in fig 3 it can be observed that the maximum tracer concentration obtained in the hssf cws filled with crushed pet bottles unexpectedly was greater than 100 mg l 1 it is believed that this occurred due to the porosity value considered the same that was found by saraiva et al 27 in calculating the lithium mass to be applied eq 1 however new tests were carried out and it was observed that the porosity value of the medium composed of crushed pet bottles varied mainly due to the different sizes of the crushed bottles in addition there may have been some accommodation of the material with the weight of gravel placed on the top layer differing from the value quantified by saraiva et al 27 in the laboratory based on these conditions the void volume of the bed would be smaller than estimated causing the passage of a tracer cloud with a concentration greater than that established 100 mg l 1 in the same figure it is possible to notice that all curves present a tail according to levenspiel 24 and borges et al 34 the tail effect occurs due to the mobility of the tracer in the porous medium diffusing in dead zones and absorbing in the substrate of the systems resulting from surface retention or hydraulic short circuits guo et al 35 evaluated the hydrodynamics of three hssf cws and attributed the tail effect to the existence of dead zones and mixing resulting in slow recovery of the tracer which was also observed by magalhães filho et al 36 and matos et al 14 thus these oscillations in the tracer concentration curve occurred due to the occasional salt retention and release in hssf cws for barca et al 37 there are two flow paths into a filter such as into hssf cw a main that represents the main peak and secondary flow path that leads to long tails in the first path the liquid would flow through the central part of the filter passing rapidly while in the secondary path the liquid would pass through dead zones or slow exchange having high hydraulic retention time which would explain the curves found in the tracer passage values of the hydrodynamic parameters obtained by means of the tracer test performed in the hssf cws are presented in table 4 the tracer mass recovered in the hydrodynamic assay in all systems was greater than 85 which maintains the integrity of the assay as was established by headley and kadlec 21 this high percentage of lithium recovery was expected since it is not absorbed by the plants the hrtn calculated varied with respect to the hssf cws filled with gravel and those with crushed pet bottles in the hssf cws filled with gravel both cultivated and uncultivated the hrtm was greater than the hrtn contrary to the expectation since was observed the surface flow at the inlet to the beds which would indicates a possible obstruction of the pore space it is understood that this was not observed due to the interference of two joint processes trapping of the tracer in dead zones and effluent flow variations caused by evaporation evapotranspiration in the systems this can also be credited to the fact that porosity measured in the laboratory is potentially different from that found in the field due to material settling influence of root growth and substrate swelling in the hssf cws according to suliman et al 38 the use of reactive substrates intensifies the formation of precipitates and contributes to rapid pore media obstruction also forming a retention nucleus of other solids enhancing the clogging process gneiss gravel is more reative than crushed pet bottles retaining and further delaying the passage of the tracer which influences the evaluation of hrt on the other hand in the hssf cws with porous media composed of crushed pet bottles the hrtm was lower than the hrtn therefore indicating greater clogging of these systems it was again speculated that there is a relationship with the considered porosity which as discussed previously which may have been overestimated besides that these results do not corroborate with what was observed visually in the monitoring of clogging in hssf cws due to the absence of runoff in the cw p fig 2 as well as the large difference in the amount of solids withdrawn from the systems table 2 which would lead to greater clogging in systems with the gravel substrate one hypothesis to explain the contrasting results is based on the characteristics of the solids which is more important than the quantity with regards to the obstruction of porous systems 29 31 37 despite the greater amount of clogging solids present in the beds filled with gravel they consist of a larger proportion of inorganic solids which occupy less volume than the organic solids according to matos et al 8 the latter have a specific mass nine times smaller than the fs additionally because the gravel has a larger surface area for biofilm formation a good portion of the solids may be adhered while in beds composed of crushed pet bottles they would be predominantly interstitial in theory the hssf cws filled with gravel should present worse conditions in the initial section of the bed in comparison with hssf cws filled with crushed pet bottles because the amount of solids present would compensate the higher proportion of fs in these beds which is sufficient to cause greater obstruction of the porous space in regions farther from the inlet of the hssf cws where the solids content in the two beds is reduced the organic solids present in greater proportion in the bed with crushed pet bottles which are theoretically mostly interstitial what would cause poorer hydrodynamic conditions to these units matos et al 14 observed better hydrodynamic conditions in a cultivated hssf cw compared to a similar uncultivated system even under conditions of increased surface water at the inlet of the system the authors argued that the roots can more effectively influence the increase in porosity in areas farther from the inlet where the accumulation of solids is lower near the wastewater inlet to the cw these plant structures appear to have a more prominent role in increasing the retention of solids reducing the drainable porosity this hypothesis could explain why the hssf cws with elephant grass the plant with the highest root growth table 1 in the first half of the bed where there is greater supply of organic matter and greater vs ts ratio table 3 presented a greater extension of surface flow fig 1 however at the same time they are not the units with the worst hydrodynamic conditions in hydrodynamic studies in real and simulated systems persson et al 23 found values of λ ranging from 0 11 to 0 90 according to the authors systems with λ above 0 75 present good hydraulic conditions and λ values lower than 0 50 represent low hydraulic efficiency it was observed that all the hssf cws evaluated in this study presented low hydraulic efficiency where the smallest values were found in hssf cws filled with crushed pet bottles however it was not possible to observe differences between cultivated and uncultivated hssf cws matos et al 14 evaluating the hydrodynamic conditions of hssf cws in operation for 7 years cultivated and uncultivated also observed low hydraulic efficiency in the systems borges et al 34 determined the hydraulic efficiency of three hssf cws of the same size 24 0 m x 1 0 m x 0 35 m finding values between 0 87 and 1 10 these high values were attributed among other factors to the geometry of the units which presented a length width ratio of 24 1 in terms of volumetric efficiency a value of 1 0 indicates the use of the entire volume available for flow and values greater than or less than 1 0 indicate inefficiency in use of the porous volume 22 in this study values less than one were obtained for the hssf cws filled with crushed pet bottles where the values of ve in the cultivated hssf cws were 0 8 and 0 7 respectively in the cw pte and cw pet with lower volumetric efficiencies than in the uncultivated system cw p in the cw p a value of 0 9 was obtained indicating greater clogging in the cultivated hssf cws similarly paoli and von sperling 32 studied hssf cws after 2 years of operation and by means of a radioactive tracer 82br found that the cultivated cw was more clogged presenting a ve value of 0 89 compared to 0 97 in the uncultivated unit however in the hssf cws with porous medium composed of gravel the volumetric efficiency values exceeded one an unexpected result in the present work and there is no trend between planted and non planted units according to metcalf and eddy 22 mi values near 1 indicate piston flow and values close to 22 indicate a complete mixing regime in this study systems filled with crushed pet bottles presented mi values ranging from 49 to 84 indicating complete mixing magalhães filho et al 36 working with hssf cws and high flow rates 1 14 l min 1 also found a high mi value 81 71 contrarily in hssf cws filled with gravel the mi ranged from 5 to 9 indicating piston flow alcocer et al 39 demonstrated that finer porous media induce a hydraulic behaviour closer to an ideal plug flow system corroborating the hydraulic behavior in these hssf cws sci values equal to zero indicate completely mixed flow while values smaller than 1 0 indicate the presence of short circuits based on these conditions it was possible to observe that all hssf cws evaluated in this study presented sci values close to zero characterized as high dispersion beds d 0 25 and low n value 22 matos et al 14 also observed a high dispersion in hssf cws but lower than those recorded in this study with d of 0 16 and 0 32 in the cultivated system and 0 14 in the uncultivated system matos et al 40 obtained d values in hssf cw unplanted prototypes with different aspect ratio lenght width l w from 0 09 and 0 13 within the moderate dispersion range 0 025 d 0 20 as established by kadlec and wallace 2 the d values obtained are according to those reported in other authors 0 08 33 0 19 for unplanted systems and between 0 14 to 0 31 for planted systems 41 in unplanted hssf cws pedescoll et al 18 obtained a d of 0 35 in prototypes of l w 1 6 1 cultivating phragmites australis małoszewski et al 42 obtained a d of 0 14 in the autumn and 0 06 in the summer in hssf cw prototypes of l w 0 31 1 while pedescoll et al 18 obtained 0 14 in hssf cw prototypes of l w 1 6 1 seeger et al 43 0 11 in hssf cws of l w 4 5 1 garcia 44 obtained 0 18 and 0 18 in hssf cw pairs of l w 1 1 0 12 to 0 07 in l w pairs of 1 5 1 and 0 08 and 0 05 in l w pairs of 2 1 it was noted that in the first few hours of the experiment a significant quantity of lithium was rapidly conducted out of the unit resulting in the maximum tracer peak the remainder exited slowly over the course of the evaluation period it was verified that these multiple factors are in agreement with the high intensity dispersion model and with strong tendency to flow with a high degree of mixture with the hydrodynamic study it was possible to analyze that the cultivated hssf cws despite presenting greater surface runoff did not show a higher degree of clogging in the medium and this may have occurred due to the expansion of roots and rhizomes resulting in a greater void volume 4 conclusions it can be concluded that surface runoff was higher in systems containing the gravel substrate and when cultivated with plants in the systems where elephant grass was cultivated in the first half and tifton grass in the second half the highest surface runoff was observed which allows for inferring that the type and sequence of plant species may interfere on the clogging process of hssf cws the quantities of solids accumulated in the substrate of the hssf cws filled with gravel are 4 times higher than those accumulated in those filled with crushed pet bottles due to wear of the gravel the clogging solids are mostly inorganic and result from wear crumbling of the substrate however organic solids are those that most influence the occurrence of the surface runoff process in hssf cws from the hydrodynamic test it was possible to observe that all hssf cws regardless of the substrate type and form of their cultivation presented dead zones and great dispersion despite the higher solids concentration and greater surface flow the beds filled with gravel and cultivated with the plants showed better hydrodynamic conditions than the other treatments which indicates the importance of analyzing the characteristics of the solids and the effect of pore space expansion by the roots crushed pet bottles may be a viable alternative substrate in hssf cws because they are inert present low wear and contribute fewer pore clogging solids acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the brazilian agencies cnpq and epamig for their support of the research
