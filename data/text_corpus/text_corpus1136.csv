5680,intense storm surge can lead to severe coastal floods flood inundation simulation is useful to identify areas that are most vulnerable to severe storm surges and to address potential flooding hazards in this paper both 2d and 3d hydrodynamic models are built separately to quantify the flood danger to a coastal city a digital city model is generated by integrating building information modeling bim and geographic information systems gis technology based on digital aerial photogrammetry for the 3d hydrodynamic model the results reveal that 2d hydrodynamic assumptions and approximations weaken if the vertical fluctuations are enormous especially in urban environments in comparison a 3d model coupled with high resolution topographic data can provide a more realistic and accurate result for the complex flow field furthermore a comparison between using the digital city model and a standard digital elevation model dem in a 3d model has been conducted the flood inundation is simulated step wise using the standard dem while the wave front propagates in a more realistic manner based on high resolution topography data thus a 3d hydrodynamic model coupled with the digital city model is recommended for urban flood simulation which is promising to improve the ability of flood prediction and prevention keywords urban flood inundation 3d hydrodynamic model digital aerial photogrammetry oblique images 1 introduction an increasing frequency and intensity of floods resulting from climate change and human activities as well as a high settlement density and associated concentration of valuable objects in flood prone areas are the main causes of increasing economic losses due to extreme events jha et al 2012 according to the emergency events database em dat of the world health organization floods account for 41 of all natural disasters 49 of all affected populations 7 of all deaths and 22 of all economic losses from natural disasters douben 2006 cavallo et al 2013 among all the flood disasters in coastal cities storm surges which are generated by extreme atmospheric disturbances can lead to severe coastal floods particularly when they coincide with high astronomical tides and result in overtopping and breaching of sea defences as a result research on coastal flood disaster prediction and management has attracted great attention worldwide and has become one of the hot issues in the field of disaster risk management botzen et al 2013 experience from implementing the international strategy for disaster reduction in the past 20 years shows that among the three tasks of handling a natural disaster disaster prevention is the most critical problem carson et al 2016 hallegatte et al 2013 wahl et al 2015 urban inundation simulation is a useful tool to identify areas that are most vulnerable to severe storm surges and to address potential flooding hazards where they are projected to occur therefore while adopting traditional engineering measures to reduce the danger of urban flooding enhancing the prediction ability of urban floods by integrating hydrodynamic models is necessary these measures would indeed improve the scientific level of flood prevention and reduce the loss from urban flood disasters there have been numerical modeling studies of flood inundation mostly in 2d brown et al 2007 fewtrell et al 2008 gallegos et al 2009 schubert and sanders 2012 gallien et al 2014 which can yield valuable insights into many applications such as dam break flooding gallegos et al 2009 liang and borthwick 2009 urban coastal flooding ramirez et al 2016 gallien et al 2011 and watershed flooding de béjar 2011 the shallow water equations swes which are derived from the navier stokes equations are adopted to calculate the arrival time and submergence depth of a flood event at a specific location though the nonlinear swes have been proven to support the accurate and stable prediction of flooding and drainage dynamics in many circumstances wahl et al 2015 gallien et al 2014 ramirez et al 2016 the dimensional limitation and the confinement of some empirical equations in 2d hydrodynamic models have recently been challenged ramirez et al 2016 showed that highly simplified modeling performs acceptably in steep terrain however it is precisely those flat feature rich topographies that demand complex modeling mignot et al 2006 carried out an urban flood inundation simulation based on swes and found that a 2d model could accurately depict the flood extent even though the urban area was bounded by steep topography however the prediction of flood depth was reported to have a relatively large root mean square error 50 despite efforts to calibrate the model parameters nazari et al 2018 indicated that a 2d approach is unable to achieve realistic and reliable output data and the dimensional limitation affects the vorticity shape and its dissipation the urban flood inundation process has properties of rapid flow regime change small water depth over a high topographical gradient wet dry transitions and intensive collisions with structures these aspects represent numerical challenges for 2d swes based standard numerical modeling tools which might not include proper numerical treatments of these properties chen and xue 2018 showed that 3d models lead to slightly better predictions for the pressure and the bed shear stress in fact if the fluctuations in the third dimension are small relative to those in the remaining two dimensions and small relative to the time scales of interest the 2d assumptions the static pressure assumption ignoring the vertical acceleration and the free surface curvature may indeed be valid and the 2d depth averaged approach may be justified and well suited for shallow near homogeneous systems however as the flow departs from this limit the basis for the 2d assumptions weakens and the computed 2d flow will depart from the physically accurate 3d analogue wang et al 2014 suggested that even if appropriate parameterizations of relevant 3d effects are incorporated into the 2d large amplitude meanders model the 2d numerical simulation fails to capture some 3d patterns and most of the observed flow and morphodynamics patterns are well captured by a 3d model furthermore the shear stress known as friction is a key factor influencing a fluid body during its motion along an uneven terrain surface uncertainty occurs since empirical equations are derived to represent the terrain surface roughness obviously the manning equation and the chézy formula are understood as gross procedures since the friction coefficient is assumed to be constant regardless of both the water depth and flow velocity this fact has been questioned recently bellos et al 2018 the shear stress is known to be proportional to the square of the mean flow velocity this means that for determining the effect of friction on the flow the velocity profile should be known therefore the full velocity vector in three dimensions is required moreover the 3d character of the turbulent dispersion is neglected if only two dimensions are considered in the simulated problem this results in an unrealistic flow motion li et al 2008 moreover a 3d model is able to consider the interaction between floodwater and the ground as well as obstruction from buildings buildings might not only block the flow and change the flood pathways but also produce frictional resistance to the floodwater and the vertical turbulent dispersion is enormous when encountering obstructions although buildings have a great impact on the flow field in urban areas their treatments using different methods in 2d models are associated with uncertainties schubert and sanders 2012 gerl et al 2014 2d building representation without relevant building elevation data did not fully correspond to the buildings actually affected by the flood analysis may be partly hindered by the characteristics and inaccuracies of the building datasets used and the modeled flood in comparison 3d models are able to describe the main characteristics of the complex dynamics and the vortex structure in the flood inundation process although at the price of high computational demand and considerable efforts for the mesh design and the model calibration even though physics based hydrodynamic models can be perfect good topography data are required to set proper boundary conditions and initial conditions for the model and the movement of floodwater is highly dependent on the topography urban flood inundation is particularly challenging to model because of a multitude of complex geometries and metre scale features including preferential flow paths between buildings drainage networks and all types of obstructions national research council 2009 relatively small man made structures require appropriate spatial resolution in model grids and must be accurately computed small scale geometric features such as a channel or bar can have important large scale effects on flows to achieve a horizontal topographical resolution fine enough to represent flood inundation influencing structures in urban type environments the interval of spot elevation data should be in the range of 0 1 0 4 m for dem generation mark et al 2004 while traditional modeling methods are time consuming and inefficient few studies involving real 3d flood simulations have been performed focusing on the modeling of an urban man made environment many efforts have been made by various scientific disciplines e g photogrammetry remote sensing geo informatics computer vision and computer graphics to obtain accurate and timely updated 3d building models identifying lidar data to classify different land cover and then simulating 2d hydrodynamic processes based on elevation data extracted from lidar is a general method to assess flood danger however néelz et al 2006 found significant limitations of lidar for resolving built up areas while webster et al 2004 and gallien et al 2014 suggested that lidar inadequately resolves abrupt elevation changes such as wharves or sea defences gallien et al 2018 given the necessity to cover large areas passive or active airborne data still represent the most common source of information for capturing the 3d geometry of urban scenarios theoretically optical images with their high spatial resolution allow for the extraction of 3d points at a remarkable geometric resolution accuracy and reliability furthermore the quickly growing sector of oblique airborne cameras is demonstrating its potential for detailed reconstruction of building facades and footprint extraction chen et al 2009 toschi et al 2017 goetz 2013 proposed a method for the creation of a highly detailed city model with an interior structure the limitations and restrictions of this approach lie in the process of data acquisition the integrated application of building information modeling bim and geographic information systems gis enables us to acquire the interior information of structures digital city models allow measurement of building height and distances and digitization of man made structures murtiyoso et al 2014 the emergence of bim and gis technology enables a transformative step towards the integration of spatial information at different levels and makes building representation more convenient rational and standardized irizarry et al 2013 in this paper oblique images captured with an unmanned aerial vehicle uav are processed to generate a digital city model with detailed surface features based on the accurate topography data and detailed building representation both 2d and 3d hydrodynamic models simulating overland flow caused by storm surges are established to quantify the influence of terrain with different resolutions on the hydrodynamic models a comparison with data from different sources is performed the objectives of this study are the following 1 to explore a novel framework for modeling urban flood inundation in 3d by integrating bim gis and digital aerial photogrammetry technology 2 to assess the modeling ability of the proposed 3d urban flooding model framework especially in addressing problems such as small water depth over high topographical gradients as well as wet dry transitions and to measure the difference between the 2d and 3d simulation results 3 to determine how the 3d hydrodynamic model based on high resolution terrain data improves the model accuracy and can be used to identify flood dangers in flood prone urban areas 2 study area the study area is located in huancui district of weihai city along the bohai sea coast with a developed economy and a dense population influenced by the geographical location weather conditions and seabed topography the region is often attacked by storm surges when storm surges occur especially when coinciding with high astronomical tides the sea water level increases abruptly a large volume of water can rush into the city thus causing waterlogging because of the gentle terrain and small drainage outlet freshwater is unable to drain to the bays via gravity due to the high tail water level from the storm surge the high water level can remain for a long time which further aggravates the disaster statistical data show that this area suffers damage from storm surges to varying degrees every year over the past 500 years the number of recorded storm surges along the coast of shandong province reached 96 among them 33 storm surges are categorized as severe disasters the strongest storm surge since 1969 occurred starting on march 4th and extending through 5th 2007 gui 2000 the sea level increased by 3 5 m and a large area was flooded even though the region is protected by a network of sea defences comprising reinforced concrete walls and supporting structures along the waterfront buildings as shown in fig 1 to protect human life and property there it is critical to perform urban flooding simulation to enhance the prediction ability of flood routing and formulate feasible protection plans which could provide a reference for flood control and danger reduction 3 method oversimplified or entirely neglected physical processes and mathematical approximations used in the governing equations cause currently inevitable model errors to assess the impact of dimensional limitation and simplified topographic data on simulations both the 2d and 3d hydrodynamic models coupled with the high resolution terrain data and the standard 30 m dem are separately set up to conduct flood inundation simulations 3 1 terrain generation a multi camera system equipped on an uav that captures oblique images in different directions serves as a dataset acquisition tool the block covered an area of 1 5 km 1 5 km and was executed on july 6 2018 with favourable weather conditions a dji s1000 uav equipped with 5 sonyilce 5100 camera lenses was arranged for this flight plan and employed along and across overlaps of 80 and 60 respectively to compensate for aircraft instability with the assistance of the contextcapture software package automatic image interpretation that produces a detailed 3d geometry is conducted after orienting the images and calibrating the cameras the output 3d mesh constitutes a high resolution geometric approximation of the study area ground truth data surveyed with a real time kinematic rtk system with a mean 3d accuracy of 0 05 m were provided in the form of 10 independent check points the accuracy of this city geometry is evaluated by comparing these check points with object points in the digital city model the comparison results show that the maximum error the minimum error and the median error of the plane position of the model is 0 463 m 0 078 m and 0 238 m respectively the accuracy of the model meets the specification s requirements bureau of surveying and mapping geographic information of people s republic of china 2012 the above digital city model contains detailed surface features but lacks a description of the interiors of the buildings while few studies have conducted a 3d urban flood routing process simulation there are even fewer interior flow field descriptions the integrated application of bim and gis technology enables a transformative step towards integration of spatial information at different levels and may provide a vivid description of the interior and exterior of buildings thus the 3d flood simulation can model the detailed interior flow in buildings to generate the 2d terrain 10 000 points are converted from the digital city geometry to characterize uneven terrain and other surface features and at most 3080 points can be extracted from the standard 30 m dem as is shown in fig 2 additional attention should be devoted to addressing buildings using the standard dem 3 2 construction of the 2d and 3d hydrodynamic models the 2d hydrodynamic model is based on the depth averaged shallow water equations swes with a closure relationship for the turbulence and the nikuradse friction law to parameterize roughness effects the 3d hydrodynamic model is based on the 3d reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with the non hydrostatic pressure approximation detailed information about the governing equations can be found in many publications temam and chorin 1977 constantin and escher 1998 according to statistical data storm surge that occurs once every 100 years in the study area may increase the sea level by 3 5 m which was selected as the inflow condition gui 2000 wang et al 2018 while the top boundary was specified as a free surface and the rest of the model boundaries were defined as no flow boundaries the 3d computational domain was separately meshed with different grid resolutions of 1 m 2 m and 5 m to perform the sensitivity analysis then the domain with a global size of 1 m was sub divided into a gradient nested structured mesh with a minimum size of 0 5 m and the total element number was 65 8 million regarding the 2d model roughly 3 million unstructured triangular meshes were acquired an iterative process was conducted to ensure that grid spacing and types do not exert an effect on the simulation outcomes 4 validation coastal ocean observation data are relatively scarce and often do not capture complex coastal dynamics making calibration of the model infeasible normally the flood extent is used to validate the accuracy of flooding models herein an urban flood experiment with exact flow depth data testa et al 2007 and the observed tide rise process on april 16th 2019 in the study area are utilized to validate the accuracy of the model first a flooding model which has sufficient experimental data regarding the water depth at 10 probe points fig 3 was constructed with the same modeling method to validate the applicability and accuracy of the 3d model the physical experiment scale was 1 100 and the 10 probe points were set up to observe the variation of the water depth testa et al 2007 a comparison between the physical experiment and the simulation result regarding the flow depth at all the 10 probe points is performed the results show that the average error of the flow depth is within 15 at all of the points fig 4 therefore the 3d hydrodynamic model established in this paper is applicable to urban flood inundation simulations furthermore the tide rise process on april 16th 2019 was surveyed to validate the accuracy of the model difficulties in measuring the spatiotemporal variations of physical quantities hamper field scale surveys only the maximum flow extent during the tide rise process has been acquired along the coast and the sea water level acquired from weihai tidal station is selected as the boundary condition to force the hydrodynamic model as is shown in fig 5 the simulated maximum flood extent coincides with the field surveyed result red line which indicates that the modeling method is effective 4 1 sensitivity to mesh resolution modeling uncertainties can originate from a wide range of physical processes and at a wide range of spatiotemporal scales in the absence of field observations probabilistic assessments of uncertainty can be difficult however sensitivity analysis and more rudimentary forms of uncertainty analysis may help to identify the key sources and magnitude of uncertainty in the model predictions the complexity of urban environments often requires a grid that will result in a scientifically credible yet computationally feasible model the grid should provide a compromise between depicting the physical realities of the urban environment and computational feasibility therefore different mesh resolutions 1 m 2 m and 5 m are adopted to perform the sensitivity analysis of the flood extents as shown in fig 5 most inundation areas coincide with each other under different grid resolutions which are categorized as matches and marked in yellow the inundation extent of the 5 m grid resolution covers a larger area at places with sharp terrain such as the northeast corner while at places with gentle terrain it seems that the finer mesh yields a greater inundated area a likely explanation for this result is that the coarser grid cannot accurately represent the sharp terrain with small obstacles where water flow may be blocked so in these areas the coarser grids provide inundation results while finer grids do not another possible reason is that in these areas the individual coarse grid covers a larger area even though the grid is not fully filled up and it would still represent that the grid is inundated by water if the volume of water in a grid exceeds a previously set threshold begnudelli et al 2008 5 results the dhi mike 21 and flow 3d software packages are adopted to conduct the 2d and 3d coastal flood inundation simulations respectively a comparison of the 2d and 3d results is conducted the influence of topographic data acquired with different methods i e a digital city model and a simple dem on the 3d simulation results is investigated the total element number of the 3d computational domain is 65 8 million with the use of an intel core e5 1603 quad core processor 2 80 ghz 32 gb of main memory and a parallel software license code computation times of approximately 80 h are required for the 3d simulation regarding the 2d model roughly 3 million unstructured triangular meshes are adopted and the maximum computational time is 4 h 5 1 comparison between 2d and 3d simulation results three relatively large inundation areas marked by the red trapezium in fig 6 were predicted in the area with similar trumpet shaped topography both in the 2d and 3d models when the flood comes it is more conducive to obtaining a large volume of water since the geometry is wide at first as the flood travels forward the mouth towards the interior of the trumpet shaped topography gradually narrows the flood has no choice but to go deeper attacking the sea defences and a quantity of water rushes into the city interior which makes the flood danger worse figs 7 and 8 demonstrate that 2d and 3d results cover a similar flood inundation extent except the areas with complex structures and narrow streets it can be observed that the 2d model failed to predict the flood routing path into the inland area and the submerged area is distributed in a band shaped area along the coast in contrast the 3d model can accurately distinguish the elevation gradient and thus the flood can flow further into the city along streets the final inundation area of 2d and 3d model is 0 37 km2 and 0 41 km2 the discrepancy arises from the complex behaviour of the flow near the areas with rapid changes in bed elevation and narrow streets reproducing very small scale eddies is not generally considered necessary when modeling large bays and estuaries for the purpose of providing flow field information however correctly obtaining the vertical turbulence and reproducing the residual circulation are extremely important for predicting the flow path teeter et al 2001 when the flood inundates the urban area the interaction between complex geometries on the ground surface makes it develop 3d features such as vertical acceleration and a non hydrostatic pressure distribution in this case 3d modeling techniques are required to describe the main characteristics of the complex dynamics of the flip through impact process and capture the vertical vortex since this phenomenon is locally markedly 3d and presents strong curvature of the free surface with a non hydrostatic distribution of pressure along the vertical direction a vertically averaged approach would exhibit limitations in reconstructing the impact of violent flows against an obstacle as is depicted in fig 8 when the reflected wave encounters the forward flood the formed vertical vortex further disturbs the flow field large free surface deformations and splashing are captured by the 3d model the apparent 3d effect cannot be ignored in such areas since the turbulent energy is dissipated mainly by collisions in the vertical direction the 3d characteristics of the turbulent dispersion are neglected if only two dimensions are considered in the simulated problem which results in an unrealistic flow motion li et al 2008 as is shown in fig 9 the vertical velocity component is mainly concentrated in the areas with obvious topographic fluctuations where the flow direction changes due to the obstruction encountered as can be observed from the results the instant vertical magnitude of the velocity can reach to 3 2 m s which is appreciable and cannot be omitted for the sake of accuracy while the 2d depth average shallow water equations cannot capture the accurate flow dynamics ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 10 feature points along the coast shown in fig 7 are selected to characterize the flow field the variation trends of the results at these points are similar here taking p06 as an example see fig 10 the hydrodynamic pressure is approximately 5000 pa greater than the hydrostatic pressure regarding the velocity a very large fluctuation is observed at the moment that the flood arrives in the early stage the depth average 3d velocity is larger than the 2d value since the vertical velocity is dominant when encountering obstructions the depth average 3d velocity decreases more quickly than the 2d value a possible explanation for this is the neglect of the vertical turbulent dispersion in 2d models in table 1 a quantitative comparison reveals discrepancies between the flow depth pressure depth average velocity calculated by the present 3d model and the 2d model at the selected points the mean absolute error mae values of the three variables are 0 05 0 21 m 1847 5589 pa 0 03 0 24 m s the discrepancy arises from the 2d assumptions which are not suitable for turbulent flow with enormous vertical variation bottom shear stress in the 2d model directly translates into mitigating the depth averaged velocity and consequently increases the flow depth molinari et al 2019 the horizontal velocity is depth averaged i e uniform in the vertical direction and vertical shear is absent national research council 2009 however the bottom shear stress balances the vertical shear in 3d model and only directly affects the horizontal velocity near the bottom cell under the high flow condition the depth averaged velocity in the 2d model is greater than the near wall velocity in the 3d model and the bottom shear stress and free surface elevation are also greater resulting in unsatisfactory performance for the 2d model 5 2 comparison of the terrain s impact on the simulation results in order to discuss the importance of digital city model flood inundation simulations were conducted with the flow 3d hydrodynamic model using both the standard and improved elevation datasets the results based on the standard topography datasets are obviously affected by the errors in the dem because the standard dem is provided in integer format the expansion and shrinking of the flow were simulated in a step wise manner fig 11 while the extent of the inundation area changed in a more realistic manner based on high resolution topography data the smooth elevation transition without detailed surface features in the standard dem results in the steady flow condition no turbulent flow or vertical vortex is formed this is an unrealistic outcome indicating that the over simplified model cannot accurately represent the real world conditions regarding the low lying vegetated regions distributed on the left side of the research area the digital city model is sufficiently fine to present every street and structure so the inland flood process even the buildings interior flood process is calculated and is marked in orange in fig 11 right panel all the terrain features are neglected by smooth interpolation between large gradients of the standard dem so the block of the steep slope cannot be correctly represented and the flow may march further than the detailed topography data which are shaded green in fig 11 right panel this result suggests that we need detailed topography data for better flood inundation simulations furthermore the standard dem data are processed to set up the 2d and 3d hydrodynamic models separately no apparent differences are observed between 2d and 3d simulation results as the geometry is simple enough and includes no narrow streets or complex structures the fluctuations are not apparent in such circumstances and the depth average shallow water equations indeed yield an acceptable result with much less computational demand and preliminary effort in this case the benefits of the 3d simulation are less clear and the 2d model is an attractive alternative to the 3d model the different treatments of buildings in the 2d and 3d models also has a very large impact on the flow motion the buildings are treated as blocks where the water cannot flow through in the 2d model and the wall friction in the vertical direction is ignored while the 3d hydrodynamic model coupled with the digital city model can simulate the surface roughness therefore the frictional resistance to the floodwater in the 3d model can be accurately simulated which is very important to the flow dynamics fig 12 shows that flood flow reaches the building envelope after approximately 58 s and rushes into the house after approximately 70 s of simulation the first floor is filled and the flow continuously travels to the inner building the maximum submerged depth is about 1 8 m the flooding process into the building s interior emphasizes the vertical velocity due to the obstacle of the enclosing walls of the building the complexity and transient characteristics are the primary features of the flow field around the structures the 2d simulation and the over simplified topography cannot capture such detailed information about these flow characteristics high resolution topography is obviously necessary for fine urban flood simulations in which narrow streets and buildings have large scale effects on the flow motion they not only block the flow and change the flood pathways but also produce frictional resistance to the floodwater coupled with the digital city model the 3d approach is expected to accurately represent the complex 3d phenomenon of the interaction between the ground reaction and the building obstruction 5 3 flood inundation at local parts from a perspective view as is depicted in fig 13 it can be observed that the overwhelming flood first hit the lowland area with a trumpet shaped topography and it then proceeded forward along the road and bare land due to the obstruction of the buildings as it goes deeper the reflection of the building becomes heavier and heavier thus the dominant flow cannot proceed further deeper in the city as a result the flow has to change its direction to spread across the whole waterfront area owing to the high tail water level caused by the storm surge and the existence of the sea defences freshwater is unable to drain to the bay via gravity the continual flood pouring into city from the gaps of sea defence the obstruction of the building in the city interior and the high tail water aggravate the situation of the flood danger as can be observed from fig 13 a very intuitive presentation of the flood inundation process can be provided by the 3d model including information about the flood extent water depth velocity and any variables of concern this is very useful in practical work for decision makers and managers obviously the 2d model is not able to achieve this 5 4 flood danger analysis both the 2d and 3d results demonstrate that the study area has great potential flooding danger on account of the characteristics of the topographic distribution and locations of such regions once the flood occurs emergency rescue of residents mainly relies on the community therefore the whole area is divided into 47 parts according to the boundaries of the communities to assess the flood danger flood danger mainly occurs within 200 m of the coastal bank and the population distribution is relatively small sea defences greatly attenuate flood energy resulting in a gradual reduction in flood danger the submerged area with a flow depth 0 2 m is 0 31 km2 accounting for 16 9 of the study area and the inundation impacts approximately 400 people about 4 buildings are actually submerged in 3d simulation fig 14 generally the area is vulnerable to severe flooding caused by storm surges although the inner city is protected by sea defences and waterfront buildings the floodplain is limited in scope and the losses are concentrated in coastal areas once a severe storm surge occurs traffic is affected at first which has a negative impact on the measures to evacuate people in the study areas indeed 2d models can give very rough approximations about what the flood extend would be 2d building representation without relevant building elevation data do not fully correspond to the buildings actually affected by the flood while 3d models can provide more accurate and realistic results to address the potential flood danger fig 14 6 discussion currently information about under water bathymetry and subsurface pipeline networks are not generally available from uavs although river channel depth and pipelines are key factors in determining the channel s flow capacity and flood inundation extent on the other hand since the high tail water level caused by the storm surge can remain for a long time freshwater is unable to drain to the bay via gravity furthermore since the simulation time is limited by the computational expense the drainage systems and the recession period are not taken into consideration in the current study human intervention in surface water dynamics e g levees and canal networks is also not adequately considered in flood inundation models the rising coastal sea level and the land subsidence in coastal areas caused by excessive exploitation of groundwater gradually reduce the defence standards of seawalls and indirectly increase the probability of disasters in coastal areas thus we have to integrate these effects into topography datasets in the future there are certain limitations associated with the use of this model field observation data are problematic due to the variable nature of the flow field and they are generally unable to capture complex coastal dynamics the limited accuracy of field observations together with the lack of simultaneous physical measurements of overtopping volumes hampers the ability to validate flood models therefore calibration of the flood routing model cannot be performed adequately in the study area the complexity of coastal urban environments often requires a grid that will result in a scientifically credible yet computationally feasible model model limitations and coarse grid representations contribute to uncertain impact estimates the current mesh size can meet the computational requirements but if more detailed flow fields are required the mesh must be further subdivided 7 conclusion this study integrates bim and gis technology based on digital aerial photogrammetry to construct a 3d hydrodynamic model the comparison results between 2d and 3d approach indicate that the present 3d model has the potential to enhance the validity of numerical simulations based on digital city model by providing very detailed flow information such as the flood extent axial velocity and vortex structures etc however if the terrain is sufficiently flat and no complex structures are to be considered the flood extent can be acceptably predicted using the 2d hydrodynamic model and the required computational resources and human effort are less than those of the 3d model once the terrain surface is filled with narrow streets and complex structures and the turbulent flow is aggravated the model assumptions and approximations weaken the 2d model s performance the 2d flow depth are slightly greater than the 3d results with the mae ranging from 0 03 to 0 24 m s the discrepancy arises because the shear stress is calculated using a constant friction coefficient and the 2d depth average velocity the full velocity vector in three dimensions is adopted to calculate a more realistic shear stress in general applying discharge dependent strickler values and preferring higher dimensional models over lower ones has the potential to improve the modeling results flood danger analysis are typically dealing with extreme events and failure scenarios which have hardly been or not at all observed due to the variable nature of the land cover in residential areas and the likely removal of material during an extreme event the model uncertainty is inevitable epistemic uncertainty can certainly be decreased by an increase in knowledge regarding the model structure and parameter value uncertainty which might result from imprecisions due to the simplification of the real world processes can be decreased by the aforementioned 3d hydrodynamic model impact of spatial inaccuracies in building databases have received little attention in 2d models the analysis may be partly hindered by the characteristics and inaccuracies of the building datasets used and the modeled flood the polygon like shaped building features without relevant building elevation data did not fully correspond to the buildings actually affected by the flood also the 2d model has not accounted sufficiently for the skin friction effects of the walls given that the building area accounts for 63 of the study area the distinction between 2d and 3d hydrodynamic model to quantify the flood danger analysis is listed in table 2 2d simulation has large confinements in the flood inundation process due to the obvious 3d effect formed by the city environment correctly obtaining the vertical turbulence right and reproducing the residual circulation are extremely important for predicting the flow path and to get a real flood extent by conducting the 3d hydrodynamic simulation coupled with digital city model the flow depth flow velocity and the total pressure can be accurately estimated to identify the most dangerous areas model errors are currently inevitable due to uncertainties in the oversimplified or entirely neglected physical processes and mathematical approximations used in the governing equations but with the application of 3d hydrodynamic model based on digital city model the uncertainty can be decreased to a large extent therefore the flood danger analysis in city environment can be improved which enable more informed regulatory and development decisions and potential reductions in

dat of the world health organization floods account for 41 of all natural disasters 49 of all affected populations 7 of all deaths and 22 of all economic losses from natural disasters douben 2006 cavallo et al 2013 among all the flood disasters in coastal cities storm surges which are generated by extreme atmospheric disturbances can lead to severe coastal floods particularly when they coincide with high astronomical tides and result in overtopping and breaching of sea defences as a result research on coastal flood disaster prediction and management has attracted great attention worldwide and has become one of the hot issues in the field of disaster risk management botzen et al 2013 experience from implementing the international strategy for disaster reduction in the past 20 years shows that among the three tasks of handling a natural disaster disaster prevention is the most critical problem carson et al 2016 hallegatte et al 2013 wahl et al 2015 urban inundation simulation is a useful tool to identify areas that are most vulnerable to severe storm surges and to address potential flooding hazards where they are projected to occur therefore while adopting traditional engineering measures to reduce the danger of urban flooding enhancing the prediction ability of urban floods by integrating hydrodynamic models is necessary these measures would indeed improve the scientific level of flood prevention and reduce the loss from urban flood disasters there have been numerical modeling studies of flood inundation mostly in 2d brown et al 2007 fewtrell et al 2008 gallegos et al 2009 schubert and sanders 2012 gallien et al 2014 which can yield valuable insights into many applications such as dam break flooding gallegos et al 2009 liang and borthwick 2009 urban coastal flooding ramirez et al 2016 gallien et al 2011 and watershed flooding de béjar 2011 the shallow water equations swes which are derived from the navier stokes equations are adopted to calculate the arrival time and submergence depth of a flood event at a specific location though the nonlinear swes have been proven to support the accurate and stable prediction of flooding and drainage dynamics in many circumstances wahl et al 2015 gallien et al 2014 ramirez et al 2016 the dimensional limitation and the confinement of some empirical equations in 2d hydrodynamic models have recently been challenged ramirez et al 2016 showed that highly simplified modeling performs acceptably in steep terrain however it is precisely those flat feature rich topographies that demand complex modeling mignot et al 2006 carried out an urban flood inundation simulation based on swes and found that a 2d model could accurately depict the flood extent even though the urban area was bounded by steep topography however the prediction of flood depth was reported to have a relatively large root mean square error 50 despite efforts to calibrate the model parameters nazari et al 2018 indicated that a 2d approach is unable to achieve realistic and reliable output data and the dimensional limitation affects the vorticity shape and its dissipation the urban flood inundation process has properties of rapid flow regime change small water depth over a high topographical gradient wet dry transitions and intensive collisions with structures these aspects represent numerical challenges for 2d swes based standard numerical modeling tools which might not include proper numerical treatments of these properties chen and xue 2018 showed that 3d models lead to slightly better predictions for the pressure and the bed shear stress in fact if the fluctuations in the third dimension are small relative to those in the remaining two dimensions and small relative to the time scales of interest the 2d assumptions the static pressure assumption ignoring the vertical acceleration and the free surface curvature may indeed be valid and the 2d depth averaged approach may be justified and well suited for shallow near homogeneous systems however as the flow departs from this limit the basis for the 2d assumptions weakens and the computed 2d flow will depart from the physically accurate 3d analogue wang et al 2014 suggested that even if appropriate parameterizations of relevant 3d effects are incorporated into the 2d large amplitude meanders model the 2d numerical simulation fails to capture some 3d patterns and most of the observed flow and morphodynamics patterns are well captured by a 3d model furthermore the shear stress known as friction is a key factor influencing a fluid body during its motion along an uneven terrain surface uncertainty occurs since empirical equations are derived to represent the terrain surface roughness obviously the manning equation and the chézy formula are understood as gross procedures since the friction coefficient is assumed to be constant regardless of both the water depth and flow velocity this fact has been questioned recently bellos et al 2018 the shear stress is known to be proportional to the square of the mean flow velocity this means that for determining the effect of friction on the flow the velocity profile should be known therefore the full velocity vector in three dimensions is required moreover the 3d character of the turbulent dispersion is neglected if only two dimensions are considered in the simulated problem this results in an unrealistic flow motion li et al 2008 moreover a 3d model is able to consider the interaction between floodwater and the ground as well as obstruction from buildings buildings might not only block the flow and change the flood pathways but also produce frictional resistance to the floodwater and the vertical turbulent dispersion is enormous when encountering obstructions although buildings have a great impact on the flow field in urban areas their treatments using different methods in 2d models are associated with uncertainties schubert and sanders 2012 gerl et al 2014 2d building representation without relevant building elevation data did not fully correspond to the buildings actually affected by the flood analysis may be partly hindered by the characteristics and inaccuracies of the building datasets used and the modeled flood in comparison 3d models are able to describe the main characteristics of the complex dynamics and the vortex structure in the flood inundation process although at the price of high computational demand and considerable efforts for the mesh design and the model calibration even though physics based hydrodynamic models can be perfect good topography data are required to set proper boundary conditions and initial conditions for the model and the movement of floodwater is highly dependent on the topography urban flood inundation is particularly challenging to model because of a multitude of complex geometries and metre scale features including preferential flow paths between buildings drainage networks and all types of obstructions national research council 2009 relatively small man made structures require appropriate spatial resolution in model grids and must be accurately computed small scale geometric features such as a channel or bar can have important large scale effects on flows to achieve a horizontal topographical resolution fine enough to represent flood inundation influencing structures in urban type environments the interval of spot elevation data should be in the range of 0 1 0 4 m for dem generation mark et al 2004 while traditional modeling methods are time consuming and inefficient few studies involving real 3d flood simulations have been performed focusing on the modeling of an urban man made environment many efforts have been made by various scientific disciplines e g photogrammetry remote sensing geo informatics computer vision and computer graphics to obtain accurate and timely updated 3d building models identifying lidar data to classify different land cover and then simulating 2d hydrodynamic processes based on elevation data extracted from lidar is a general method to assess flood danger however néelz et al 2006 found significant limitations of lidar for resolving built up areas while webster et al 2004 and gallien et al 2014 suggested that lidar inadequately resolves abrupt elevation changes such as wharves or sea defences gallien et al 2018 given the necessity to cover large areas passive or active airborne data still represent the most common source of information for capturing the 3d geometry of urban scenarios theoretically optical images with their high spatial resolution allow for the extraction of 3d points at a remarkable geometric resolution accuracy and reliability furthermore the quickly growing sector of oblique airborne cameras is demonstrating its potential for detailed reconstruction of building facades and footprint extraction chen et al 2009 toschi et al 2017 goetz 2013 proposed a method for the creation of a highly detailed city model with an interior structure the limitations and restrictions of this approach lie in the process of data acquisition the integrated application of building information modeling bim and geographic information systems gis enables us to acquire the interior information of structures digital city models allow measurement of building height and distances and digitization of man made structures murtiyoso et al 2014 the emergence of bim and gis technology enables a transformative step towards the integration of spatial information at different levels and makes building representation more convenient rational and standardized irizarry et al 2013 in this paper oblique images captured with an unmanned aerial vehicle uav are processed to generate a digital city model with detailed surface features based on the accurate topography data and detailed building representation both 2d and 3d hydrodynamic models simulating overland flow caused by storm surges are established to quantify the influence of terrain with different resolutions on the hydrodynamic models a comparison with data from different sources is performed the objectives of this study are the following 1 to explore a novel framework for modeling urban flood inundation in 3d by integrating bim gis and digital aerial photogrammetry technology 2 to assess the modeling ability of the proposed 3d urban flooding model framework especially in addressing problems such as small water depth over high topographical gradients as well as wet dry transitions and to measure the difference between the 2d and 3d simulation results 3 to determine how the 3d hydrodynamic model based on high resolution terrain data improves the model accuracy and can be used to identify flood dangers in flood prone urban areas 2 study area the study area is located in huancui district of weihai city along the bohai sea coast with a developed economy and a dense population influenced by the geographical location weather conditions and seabed topography the region is often attacked by storm surges when storm surges occur especially when coinciding with high astronomical tides the sea water level increases abruptly a large volume of water can rush into the city thus causing waterlogging because of the gentle terrain and small drainage outlet freshwater is unable to drain to the bays via gravity due to the high tail water level from the storm surge the high water level can remain for a long time which further aggravates the disaster statistical data show that this area suffers damage from storm surges to varying degrees every year over the past 500 years the number of recorded storm surges along the coast of shandong province reached 96 among them 33 storm surges are categorized as severe disasters the strongest storm surge since 1969 occurred starting on march 4th and extending through 5th 2007 gui 2000 the sea level increased by 3 5 m and a large area was flooded even though the region is protected by a network of sea defences comprising reinforced concrete walls and supporting structures along the waterfront buildings as shown in fig 1 to protect human life and property there it is critical to perform urban flooding simulation to enhance the prediction ability of flood routing and formulate feasible protection plans which could provide a reference for flood control and danger reduction 3 method oversimplified or entirely neglected physical processes and mathematical approximations used in the governing equations cause currently inevitable model errors to assess the impact of dimensional limitation and simplified topographic data on simulations both the 2d and 3d hydrodynamic models coupled with the high resolution terrain data and the standard 30 m dem are separately set up to conduct flood inundation simulations 3 1 terrain generation a multi camera system equipped on an uav that captures oblique images in different directions serves as a dataset acquisition tool the block covered an area of 1 5 km 1 5 km and was executed on july 6 2018 with favourable weather conditions a dji s1000 uav equipped with 5 sonyilce 5100 camera lenses was arranged for this flight plan and employed along and across overlaps of 80 and 60 respectively to compensate for aircraft instability with the assistance of the contextcapture software package automatic image interpretation that produces a detailed 3d geometry is conducted after orienting the images and calibrating the cameras the output 3d mesh constitutes a high resolution geometric approximation of the study area ground truth data surveyed with a real time kinematic rtk system with a mean 3d accuracy of 0 05 m were provided in the form of 10 independent check points the accuracy of this city geometry is evaluated by comparing these check points with object points in the digital city model the comparison results show that the maximum error the minimum error and the median error of the plane position of the model is 0 463 m 0 078 m and 0 238 m respectively the accuracy of the model meets the specification s requirements bureau of surveying and mapping geographic information of people s republic of china 2012 the above digital city model contains detailed surface features but lacks a description of the interiors of the buildings while few studies have conducted a 3d urban flood routing process simulation there are even fewer interior flow field descriptions the integrated application of bim and gis technology enables a transformative step towards integration of spatial information at different levels and may provide a vivid description of the interior and exterior of buildings thus the 3d flood simulation can model the detailed interior flow in buildings to generate the 2d terrain 10 000 points are converted from the digital city geometry to characterize uneven terrain and other surface features and at most 3080 points can be extracted from the standard 30 m dem as is shown in fig 2 additional attention should be devoted to addressing buildings using the standard dem 3 2 construction of the 2d and 3d hydrodynamic models the 2d hydrodynamic model is based on the depth averaged shallow water equations swes with a closure relationship for the turbulence and the nikuradse friction law to parameterize roughness effects the 3d hydrodynamic model is based on the 3d reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with the non hydrostatic pressure approximation detailed information about the governing equations can be found in many publications temam and chorin 1977 constantin and escher 1998 according to statistical data storm surge that occurs once every 100 years in the study area may increase the sea level by 3 5 m which was selected as the inflow condition gui 2000 wang et al 2018 while the top boundary was specified as a free surface and the rest of the model boundaries were defined as no flow boundaries the 3d computational domain was separately meshed with different grid resolutions of 1 m 2 m and 5 m to perform the sensitivity analysis then the domain with a global size of 1 m was sub divided into a gradient nested structured mesh with a minimum size of 0 5 m and the total element number was 65 8 million regarding the 2d model roughly 3 million unstructured triangular meshes were acquired an iterative process was conducted to ensure that grid spacing and types do not exert an effect on the simulation outcomes 4 validation coastal ocean observation data are relatively scarce and often do not capture complex coastal dynamics making calibration of the model infeasible normally the flood extent is used to validate the accuracy of flooding models herein an urban flood experiment with exact flow depth data testa et al 2007 and the observed tide rise process on april 16th 2019 in the study area are utilized to validate the accuracy of the model first a flooding model which has sufficient experimental data regarding the water depth at 10 probe points fig 3 was constructed with the same modeling method to validate the applicability and accuracy of the 3d model the physical experiment scale was 1 100 and the 10 probe points were set up to observe the variation of the water depth testa et al 2007 a comparison between the physical experiment and the simulation result regarding the flow depth at all the 10 probe points is performed the results show that the average error of the flow depth is within 15 at all of the points fig 4 therefore the 3d hydrodynamic model established in this paper is applicable to urban flood inundation simulations furthermore the tide rise process on april 16th 2019 was surveyed to validate the accuracy of the model difficulties in measuring the spatiotemporal variations of physical quantities hamper field scale surveys only the maximum flow extent during the tide rise process has been acquired along the coast and the sea water level acquired from weihai tidal station is selected as the boundary condition to force the hydrodynamic model as is shown in fig 5 the simulated maximum flood extent coincides with the field surveyed result red line which indicates that the modeling method is effective 4 1 sensitivity to mesh resolution modeling uncertainties can originate from a wide range of physical processes and at a wide range of spatiotemporal scales in the absence of field observations probabilistic assessments of uncertainty can be difficult however sensitivity analysis and more rudimentary forms of uncertainty analysis may help to identify the key sources and magnitude of uncertainty in the model predictions the complexity of urban environments often requires a grid that will result in a scientifically credible yet computationally feasible model the grid should provide a compromise between depicting the physical realities of the urban environment and computational feasibility therefore different mesh resolutions 1 m 2 m and 5 m are adopted to perform the sensitivity analysis of the flood extents as shown in fig 5 most inundation areas coincide with each other under different grid resolutions which are categorized as matches and marked in yellow the inundation extent of the 5 m grid resolution covers a larger area at places with sharp terrain such as the northeast corner while at places with gentle terrain it seems that the finer mesh yields a greater inundated area a likely explanation for this result is that the coarser grid cannot accurately represent the sharp terrain with small obstacles where water flow may be blocked so in these areas the coarser grids provide inundation results while finer grids do not another possible reason is that in these areas the individual coarse grid covers a larger area even though the grid is not fully filled up and it would still represent that the grid is inundated by water if the volume of water in a grid exceeds a previously set threshold begnudelli et al 2008 5 results the dhi mike 21 and flow 3d software packages are adopted to conduct the 2d and 3d coastal flood inundation simulations respectively a comparison of the 2d and 3d results is conducted the influence of topographic data acquired with different methods i e a digital city model and a simple dem on the 3d simulation results is investigated the total element number of the 3d computational domain is 65 8 million with the use of an intel core e5 1603 quad core processor 2 80 ghz 32 gb of main memory and a parallel software license code computation times of approximately 80 h are required for the 3d simulation regarding the 2d model roughly 3 million unstructured triangular meshes are adopted and the maximum computational time is 4 h 5 1 comparison between 2d and 3d simulation results three relatively large inundation areas marked by the red trapezium in fig 6 were predicted in the area with similar trumpet shaped topography both in the 2d and 3d models when the flood comes it is more conducive to obtaining a large volume of water since the geometry is wide at first as the flood travels forward the mouth towards the interior of the trumpet shaped topography gradually narrows the flood has no choice but to go deeper attacking the sea defences and a quantity of water rushes into the city interior which makes the flood danger worse figs 7 and 8 demonstrate that 2d and 3d results cover a similar flood inundation extent except the areas with complex structures and narrow streets it can be observed that the 2d model failed to predict the flood routing path into the inland area and the submerged area is distributed in a band shaped area along the coast in contrast the 3d model can accurately distinguish the elevation gradient and thus the flood can flow further into the city along streets the final inundation area of 2d and 3d model is 0 37 km2 and 0 41 km2 the discrepancy arises from the complex behaviour of the flow near the areas with rapid changes in bed elevation and narrow streets reproducing very small scale eddies is not generally considered necessary when modeling large bays and estuaries for the purpose of providing flow field information however correctly obtaining the vertical turbulence and reproducing the residual circulation are extremely important for predicting the flow path teeter et al 2001 when the flood inundates the urban area the interaction between complex geometries on the ground surface makes it develop 3d features such as vertical acceleration and a non hydrostatic pressure distribution in this case 3d modeling techniques are required to describe the main characteristics of the complex dynamics of the flip through impact process and capture the vertical vortex since this phenomenon is locally markedly 3d and presents strong curvature of the free surface with a non hydrostatic distribution of pressure along the vertical direction a vertically averaged approach would exhibit limitations in reconstructing the impact of violent flows against an obstacle as is depicted in fig 8 when the reflected wave encounters the forward flood the formed vertical vortex further disturbs the flow field large free surface deformations and splashing are captured by the 3d model the apparent 3d effect cannot be ignored in such areas since the turbulent energy is dissipated mainly by collisions in the vertical direction the 3d characteristics of the turbulent dispersion are neglected if only two dimensions are considered in the simulated problem which results in an unrealistic flow motion li et al 2008 as is shown in fig 9 the vertical velocity component is mainly concentrated in the areas with obvious topographic fluctuations where the flow direction changes due to the obstruction encountered as can be observed from the results the instant vertical magnitude of the velocity can reach to 3 2 m s which is appreciable and cannot be omitted for the sake of accuracy while the 2d depth average shallow water equations cannot capture the accurate flow dynamics ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 10 feature points along the coast shown in fig 7 are selected to characterize the flow field the variation trends of the results at these points are similar here taking p06 as an example see fig 10 the hydrodynamic pressure is approximately 5000 pa greater than the hydrostatic pressure regarding the velocity a very large fluctuation is observed at the moment that the flood arrives in the early stage the depth average 3d velocity is larger than the 2d value since the vertical velocity is dominant when encountering obstructions the depth average 3d velocity decreases more quickly than the 2d value a possible explanation for this is the neglect of the vertical turbulent dispersion in 2d models in table 1 a quantitative comparison reveals discrepancies between the flow depth pressure depth average velocity calculated by the present 3d model and the 2d model at the selected points the mean absolute error mae values of the three variables are 0 05 0 21 m 1847 5589 pa 0 03 0 24 m s the discrepancy arises from the 2d assumptions which are not suitable for turbulent flow with enormous vertical variation bottom shear stress in the 2d model directly translates into mitigating the depth averaged velocity and consequently increases the flow depth molinari et al 2019 the horizontal velocity is depth averaged i e uniform in the vertical direction and vertical shear is absent national research council 2009 however the bottom shear stress balances the vertical shear in 3d model and only directly affects the horizontal velocity near the bottom cell under the high flow condition the depth averaged velocity in the 2d model is greater than the near wall velocity in the 3d model and the bottom shear stress and free surface elevation are also greater resulting in unsatisfactory performance for the 2d model 5 2 comparison of the terrain s impact on the simulation results in order to discuss the importance of digital city model flood inundation simulations were conducted with the flow 3d hydrodynamic model using both the standard and improved elevation datasets the results based on the standard topography datasets are obviously affected by the errors in the dem because the standard dem is provided in integer format the expansion and shrinking of the flow were simulated in a step wise manner fig 11 while the extent of the inundation area changed in a more realistic manner based on high resolution topography data the smooth elevation transition without detailed surface features in the standard dem results in the steady flow condition no turbulent flow or vertical vortex is formed this is an unrealistic outcome indicating that the over simplified model cannot accurately represent the real world conditions regarding the low lying vegetated regions distributed on the left side of the research area the digital city model is sufficiently fine to present every street and structure so the inland flood process even the buildings interior flood process is calculated and is marked in orange in fig 11 right panel all the terrain features are neglected by smooth interpolation between large gradients of the standard dem so the block of the steep slope cannot be correctly represented and the flow may march further than the detailed topography data which are shaded green in fig 11 right panel this result suggests that we need detailed topography data for better flood inundation simulations furthermore the standard dem data are processed to set up the 2d and 3d hydrodynamic models separately no apparent differences are observed between 2d and 3d simulation results as the geometry is simple enough and includes no narrow streets or complex structures the fluctuations are not apparent in such circumstances and the depth average shallow water equations indeed yield an acceptable result with much less computational demand and preliminary effort in this case the benefits of the 3d simulation are less clear and the 2d model is an attractive alternative to the 3d model the different treatments of buildings in the 2d and 3d models also has a very large impact on the flow motion the buildings are treated as blocks where the water cannot flow through in the 2d model and the wall friction in the vertical direction is ignored while the 3d hydrodynamic model coupled with the digital city model can simulate the surface roughness therefore the frictional resistance to the floodwater in the 3d model can be accurately simulated which is very important to the flow dynamics fig 12 shows that flood flow reaches the building envelope after approximately 58 s and rushes into the house after approximately 70 s of simulation the first floor is filled and the flow continuously travels to the inner building the maximum submerged depth is about 1 8 m the flooding process into the building s interior emphasizes the vertical velocity due to the obstacle of the enclosing walls of the building the complexity and transient characteristics are the primary features of the flow field around the structures the 2d simulation and the over simplified topography cannot capture such detailed information about these flow characteristics high resolution topography is obviously necessary for fine urban flood simulations in which narrow streets and buildings have large scale effects on the flow motion they not only block the flow and change the flood pathways but also produce frictional resistance to the floodwater coupled with the digital city model the 3d approach is expected to accurately represent the complex 3d phenomenon of the interaction between the ground reaction and the building obstruction 5 3 flood inundation at local parts from a perspective view as is depicted in fig 13 it can be observed that the overwhelming flood first hit the lowland area with a trumpet shaped topography and it then proceeded forward along the road and bare land due to the obstruction of the buildings as it goes deeper the reflection of the building becomes heavier and heavier thus the dominant flow cannot proceed further deeper in the city as a result the flow has to change its direction to spread across the whole waterfront area owing to the high tail water level caused by the storm surge and the existence of the sea defences freshwater is unable to drain to the bay via gravity the continual flood pouring into city from the gaps of sea defence the obstruction of the building in the city interior and the high tail water aggravate the situation of the flood danger as can be observed from fig 13 a very intuitive presentation of the flood inundation process can be provided by the 3d model including information about the flood extent water depth velocity and any variables of concern this is very useful in practical work for decision makers and managers obviously the 2d model is not able to achieve this 5 4 flood danger analysis both the 2d and 3d results demonstrate that the study area has great potential flooding danger on account of the characteristics of the topographic distribution and locations of such regions once the flood occurs emergency rescue of residents mainly relies on the community therefore the whole area is divided into 47 parts according to the boundaries of the communities to assess the flood danger flood danger mainly occurs within 200 m of the coastal bank and the population distribution is relatively small sea defences greatly attenuate flood energy resulting in a gradual reduction in flood danger the submerged area with a flow depth 0 2 m is 0 31 km2 accounting for 16 9 of the study area and the inundation impacts approximately 400 people about 4 buildings are actually submerged in 3d simulation fig 14 generally the area is vulnerable to severe flooding caused by storm surges although the inner city is protected by sea defences and waterfront buildings the floodplain is limited in scope and the losses are concentrated in coastal areas once a severe storm surge occurs traffic is affected at first which has a negative impact on the measures to evacuate people in the study areas indeed 2d models can give very rough approximations about what the flood extend would be 2d building representation without relevant building elevation data do not fully correspond to the buildings actually affected by the flood while 3d models can provide more accurate and realistic results to address the potential flood danger fig 14 6 discussion currently information about under water bathymetry and subsurface pipeline networks are not generally available from uavs although river channel depth and pipelines are key factors in determining the channel s flow capacity and flood inundation extent on the other hand since the high tail water level caused by the storm surge can remain for a long time freshwater is unable to drain to the bay via gravity furthermore since the simulation time is limited by the computational expense the drainage systems and the recession period are not taken into consideration in the current study human intervention in surface water dynamics e g levees and canal networks is also not adequately considered in flood inundation models the rising coastal sea level and the land subsidence in coastal areas caused by excessive exploitation of groundwater gradually reduce the defence standards of seawalls and indirectly increase the probability of disasters in coastal areas thus we have to integrate these effects into topography datasets in the future there are certain limitations associated with the use of this model field observation data are problematic due to the variable nature of the flow field and they are generally unable to capture complex coastal dynamics the limited accuracy of field observations together with the lack of simultaneous physical measurements of overtopping volumes hampers the ability to validate flood models therefore calibration of the flood routing model cannot be performed adequately in the study area the complexity of coastal urban environments often requires a grid that will result in a scientifically credible yet computationally feasible model model limitations and coarse grid representations contribute to uncertain impact estimates the current mesh size can meet the computational requirements but if more detailed flow fields are required the mesh must be further subdivided 7 conclusion this study integrates bim and gis technology based on digital aerial photogrammetry to construct a 3d hydrodynamic model the comparison results between 2d and 3d approach indicate that the present 3d model has the potential to enhance the validity of numerical simulations based on digital city model by providing very detailed flow information such as the flood extent axial velocity and vortex structures etc however if the terrain is sufficiently flat and no complex structures are to be considered the flood extent can be acceptably predicted using the 2d hydrodynamic model and the required computational resources and human effort are less than those of the 3d model once the terrain surface is filled with narrow streets and complex structures and the turbulent flow is aggravated the model assumptions and approximations weaken the 2d model s performance the 2d flow depth are slightly greater than the 3d results with the mae ranging from 0 03 to 0 24 m s the discrepancy arises because the shear stress is calculated using a constant friction coefficient and the 2d depth average velocity the full velocity vector in three dimensions is adopted to calculate a more realistic shear stress in general applying discharge dependent strickler values and preferring higher dimensional models over lower ones has the potential to improve the modeling results flood danger analysis are typically dealing with extreme events and failure scenarios which have hardly been or not at all observed due to the variable nature of the land cover in residential areas and the likely removal of material during an extreme event the model uncertainty is inevitable epistemic uncertainty can certainly be decreased by an increase in knowledge regarding the model structure and parameter value uncertainty which might result from imprecisions due to the simplification of the real world processes can be decreased by the aforementioned 3d hydrodynamic model impact of spatial inaccuracies in building databases have received little attention in 2d models the analysis may be partly hindered by the characteristics and inaccuracies of the building datasets used and the modeled flood the polygon like shaped building features without relevant building elevation data did not fully correspond to the buildings actually affected by the flood also the 2d model has not accounted sufficiently for the skin friction effects of the walls given that the building area accounts for 63 of the study area the distinction between 2d and 3d hydrodynamic model to quantify the flood danger analysis is listed in table 2 2d simulation has large confinements in the flood inundation process due to the obvious 3d effect formed by the city environment correctly obtaining the vertical turbulence right and reproducing the residual circulation are extremely important for predicting the flow path and to get a real flood extent by conducting the 3d hydrodynamic simulation coupled with digital city model the flow depth flow velocity and the total pressure can be accurately estimated to identify the most dangerous areas model errors are currently inevitable due to uncertainties in the oversimplified or entirely neglected physical processes and mathematical approximations used in the governing equations but with the application of 3d hydrodynamic model based on digital city model the uncertainty can be decreased to a large extent therefore the flood danger analysis in city environment can be improved which enable more informed regulatory and development decisions and potential reductions in

fully consistent with freeze and harlan s 1969 blueprint other early papers girard et al 1981 villeneuve et al 1982 are also consistent with freeze and harlan s blueprint these papers were published

model intercomparison studies provide a synopsis of a number of contemporary integrated surface subsurface flow models maxwell et al 2014 kollet et al 2017 maxwell et al 2014 discuss the important differences in coupling strategies and solution techniques that are employed by integrated models our paper commemorates the 50 year anniversary of the original blueprint paper through personal communications with allan freeze we document the history and genesis of this paper for the first time we reflect on the uptake of the blueprint into modern hydrology the development of numerical models that enabled this and the range of challenges being tackled by these models these challenges range from fundamental and theoretical discoveries about hydrologic processes to advanced applications that support water resources management finally we consider challenges and opportunities for the future of this area of modelling and hydrological science this paper is deliberately strategic philosophical historical and prospective we highlight some key points in the scientific evolution of this field and discuss their significance it is not a comprehensive review and references cited are therefore demonstrative rather than exhaustive 2 genesis of the blueprint circa 1968 1969 we begin with an historical account of the genesis of the paper which is faithfully reproduced from discussions and written communications we have had directly with allan freeze one of the original blueprint authors his co author richard lee harlan passed away in 2011 we provide first person personal communications from allan freeze to enable historical veracity and authenticity according to allan freeze also a co author of the widely known textbook groundwater freeze and cherry 1979 dick harlan and i met serendipitously not through any official professional connection but because he and his wife sandra and my wife donna and i lived in the same apartment building in calgary alberta we were both new to calgary and both of us were living temporarily in the apartment while we awaited the completion of our new houses both then under construction i had worked as a research scientist for the federal groundwater group for a few years and had recently been posted to the calgary office at that time part of the department of energy mines and resources later to be annexed into environment canada dick was an american from michigan if i remember correctly who had just been hired as a research hydrologist with the department of forestry and fisheries so we did not work for the same agency but our offices were close together and we often carpooled to work together it was during these rides that we discovered our mutual interest in computer simulations of hydrologic processes and began talking about the issues that eventually led to our joint paper the main contribution of the paper in my opinion was in getting hydrologists of all stripes interested in meeting and working with each other modern researchers will find it quaintly amusing how little interaction there was in 1969 between groundwater and surface water hydrologists each lived on their own desert islands separate associations separate associate editors at water resources research and journal of hydrology separate sessions at the american geophysical union fall meeting and seldom the twain met even when i was editor of water resources research from 1976 to 1980 i was always surprised at how naive the treatment of groundwater was in surface water papers and vice versa there were few papers that actually married the diverse components of the hydrologic cycle in any meaningful way i think much credit should be given to peter eagleson of mit and his book dynamic hydrology published in 1970 for turning the tide see eagleson 1970 r allan freeze was born in edmonton alberta on may 23 1939 he obtained both m sc and ph d degrees from the university of california berkeley he worked for the canadian government the ibm thomas j watson research center and was later a professor in the department of geological sciences at the university of british colombia freeze has received many awards for his work he is a fellow of the royal society of canada a member of the canadian academy of engineering and a foreign member of the national academy of engineering in the us he holds many other awards from professional societies freeze has wide ranging interests and hobbies he has published on the statistics of baseball batting orders freeze 1974 he is also the author of two popular science books the environmental pendulum a quest for the truth about toxic chemicals human health and environmental protection freeze 2000 and the fluoride wars how a modest public health measure became america s longest running political melodrama freeze and lehr 2009 freeze also shared a little bit more about his recent history he remarked i am alive and well in my retirement in vancouver still writing popular science as a hobby golfing to a 14 handicap not bad for a recently turned octagenarian and playing duplicate bridge regularly with my wife of 58 years as for dick he left the research world a few years after our joint paper and worked for several years for a consulting engineering company in denver colorado sadly he passed away many years ago at much too early an age fig 1a shows allan freeze and craig simmons on november 28 2018 in adelaide australia freeze also provided us with some information on dick harlan and their connection following the publication of the blueprint freeze described the period following the blueprint paper there is very little further of a joint biographical nature to disclose shortly after our blueprint paper i moved from calgary to join the ibm thomas j watson research center in yorktown heights ny and although we kept in touch we never did any joint work again we were able to glean a bit more information on dick harlan from allan freeze and from dick harlan s online obituary https horancares com obits richard l harlan richard lee harlan was born in denver colorado on july 7 1939 and died nov 15 2011 age 72 he obtained his ph d in hydrogeology from michigan state university he worked in calgary alberta and ottawa ontario for the canadian department forestry and fisheries for 15 years he then worked for 11 years as chief hydrogeologist in the denver colorado office of the american consulting firm dames and moore dick harlan was american and freeze remarked in communications with us that he was not sure why or how harlan decided to come to canada a copy of the picture of harlan from the online obituary is found in fig 1b we are not sure of the exact year this photo was taken from discussions with freeze we guess that it was probably taken a year or so before harlan s death in 2011 3 realising a dream the last 50 years 1969 2019 freeze and harlan had a dream as they carpooled they imagined a virtual hydrologic laboratory a physically based digital modelling world where important hydrologic processes and groundwater flow and surface water flow rainfall evaporation runoff recharge to groundwater could be modelled at a hydrologic basin scale their original paper was concerned with flows and hydraulics water quantities rates and flow pathways fig 2 shows the abstract from the original paper fig 3 shows fig 2 from freeze and harlan 1969 illustrating a hydrologic basin and a three dimensional nodal grid of that hydrologic basin a graphic form that nicely captures the overarching vision set out in the original blueprint paper freeze and harlan 1969 were clear about their motives their purpose was not to create an emotional pitch for a pet methodology but rather to examine the possibility of creating physically based hydrologic response models italics are freeze and harlan s own emphasis they noted that a complete simulator for the hydrologic cycle tantalizes most hydrologists but they also observed issues and limitations drawing upon comments from amorocho and hart 1964 and crawford and linsley 1966 these limitations included a lack of knowledge of physical hydrology and component phenomena as well as the prohibitive amounts of input data that would be required to realise the blueprint in practice they conceded that their paper was more of an artist s conception than a true blueprint freeze and harlan 1969 p 238 to appreciate the computational vision implicit in the original blueprint one must imagine the time when freeze and harlan wrote this paper the first paper to present a digital groundwater model was by tyson and weber 1964 george pinder and john bredehoeft had also just published a paper on the development of a digital groundwater model pinder and bredehoeft 1968 their model was verified using electrical low pass rc filter analogs for groundwater flow modelling that were still in vogue at the time these were the waning days of electrical resistor capacitor networks used to simulate groundwater flow there is a classic photo of arlan harbaugh co author of the usgs model modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 simulating groundwater at long island new york with a big electrical resistor capacitor network the size of a room fig 4 freeze and harlan noted that based on forsythe and wasow 1960 a time dependent boundary value problem in three dimensions could be tackled in moderate detail using a 100 100 100 nodal array they went on to ask what then of the machines of the 1970 s this prescient question anticipates the exciting future possibilities that growth in computer power was very likely to bring it also suggests that the authors were aware of the distinct possibility that their 1969 artist s conception could become the real world digital simulation of the future the earliest application of a blueprint based model was by freeze 1972 for a synthetic catchment the simulations were undertaken on the ibm 360 91 when freeze was working at the ibm thomas j watson research center at yorktown heights new york with a memory of 1 5 106 bytes of storage the ibm 360 91 was one of the most powerful computers then available nevertheless the spatial extent of the flow domain was limited and only a coarse mesh could be employed the first field application of this blueprint based model was to a hillslope in the sleepers river catchment in idaho stephenson and freeze 1974 keith beven beven 1975 developed a model based on the blueprint for his ph d thesis and applied it to the small east twin catchment in the uk this model was based on a hillslope segment width averaged finite element solutions rather than the finite difference structures presented in the blueprint this solution method enabled the hillslopes to look more like real hillslopes since those earliest applications the blueprint has been implemented in a growing number of integrated numerical models the surface subsurface model intercomparison study by maxwell et al 2014 clearly explains the classification of coupled hydrologic models based on the solution technique or coupling strategy that is employed they defined three approaches for solving the coupled system of equations i e the solution technique namely asynchronous linking sequential iteration and globally implicit in terms of coupling strategy they described three distinct formulations for integrating hydrostatic surface and subsurface flow namely first order exchange continuity of pressure and boundary condition switching integrated models have allowed progress on many scientific and engineering matters they have been used to study a wide range of purely theoretical to highly applied problems the application of the blueprint includes the exploration of fundamental hydrologic phenomena to advance physical hydrology freeze 1972 beven 1977 brunner and simmons 2012 to the coupling among atmospheric surface and subsurface processes e g davison et al 2018 an example of the exploration of hydrologic phenomena is the series of papers by keith loague and colleagues on the r 5 catchment oklahoma where progressively more detailed event based simulations were conducted resulting in changes in the simulated near surface response loague et al 2005 excellent review articles citing numerous studies ranging from water resources management to the coupling between soil biota or the cryosphere to mention a few examples include paniconi and putti 2015 one precondition for these applications was the significant increase in computational power kollet et al 2010 for example used 16 384 processors with about 8 109 nearly 10 billion grid cells to solve what is essentially the freeze and harlan problem their application was for a watershed on the order of 103 km2 expansions and extensions of the original blueprint have also been proposed for example partington et al 2017 proposed a framework to couple sedimentological hydrological and hydrogeological processes in streambeds the blueprint has not been without controversy criticism and debate loague and ebel 2016 earliest model applications in real field settings were not particularly successful stephenson and freeze 1974 beven 2001 2002 stephenson and freeze 1974 were amongst the earliest scientists to document challenges with the validation of hydrological models beven 2002 beven 2002 questioned the suitability of the blueprint to simulate hydrological response functions more specifically beven 1989 2002 states that darcian theory and in particular the richards equation are not appropriate to describe unsaturated subsurface flow at large scales because of heterogeneity and preferential flow paths beven 2002 does not really argue against the blueprint as a conceptual framework for catchment modelling in terms of processes he argues against the suitability of the commonly used continuum differential equations in implementing that framework there are clearly scales where the continuum approach darcian implementation simply will not work the assumption that small scale measurements apply at any scale is also clearly problematic beven and germann 2013 note that numerous extensions to richards equation have been proposed to account for preferential flow but that there is no rigorous physical underpinning to richards equation and that bolting on preferential flow capabilities is thus problematic we still have no generally applicable scale independent description of soil water flows that can be considered adequate continuum or not a universal scale independent description for dealing with such scaling would be an important evolution of the blueprint however the main contribution of the blueprint was to couple the surface with the subsurface in order to overcome the conceptual separation between the two hydrologic domains extending or replacing the conceptualization of individual processes such as unsaturated flow evapotranspiration infiltration even groundwater flow or the coupling between the surface and subsurface domain would constitute an evolution of the blueprint and its primary strategic intent changing the individual constituent process descriptions does not ipso facto undermine or invalidate the principal philosophy or motivation of the blueprint strictly speaking however whether the original blueprint is undermined or invalidated depends on whether one considers the blueprint to be intrinsically linked to continuum differential equations a continuum blueprint or not and the mathematical formulations presented in the original blueprint we do not see them as intrinsically linked our view appears to be consistent with freeze s own view when he remarks the purpose of the paper was not to get every mechanism in the hydrologic cycle dead to rights but rather to promote more integrated treatments we also assert that there are many situations where the continuum approach is valid and effective numerous modelling studies several of which are described in this paper demonstrate that integrated modelling produces results that are consistent with observations at the representative scale of the problem under consideration obviously integrated modelling that applies the blueprint philosophy must always exercise care and caution an appropriate objective for the study and the model that is employed must be defined the model s formulation and assumptions including conceptualisation and governing equations must clearly be appropriate to ensure robust and reliable results that meet the modelling objectives and to ensure consistency with observations at the scale of interest this applies to all modelling and not just integrated modelling beven 2002 also criticizes the term physically based while acknowledging that the blueprint is derived deductively from established physical principles he highlights that physically based should also imply consistency with observations which according to beven is not the case for the blueprint based models beven 2002 speculated that the original blueprint or perhaps more specifically the continuum differential equation approach presented in the original blueprint will eventually be abandoned beven 2002 proposed the concept of an alternative blueprint which is consistent with observations at the scale of interest recent review papers paniconi and putti 2015 barthel and banzhaf 2016 clark et al 2017 on blueprint based models however indicate that there are a growing number of applications linked to observable field data in addition to the application of blueprint based models to explore fundamental physics the significant developments in data acquisition data assimilation kurtz et al 2017 and the subsequent integration with model calibration schilling et al 2019 will certainly continue in the future data assimilation and model surrogacy can be a way of correcting and compensating for a model s deficiencies as is regularly done in weather forecasting it is useful for operational purposes however data assimilation and computational advances cannot by themselves be the basis for understanding and advancing fundamental physics although numerous challenges clearly do remain current citation data and contemporary applications suggest growth in the interest and importance of spatially distributed physically based hydrologic modelling citation data for freeze and harlan 1969 plotted as cumulative citations over time fig 5 show a large growth in citations with time the data in this figure were accessed from google scholar on 6 september 2019 when the total citation count was 736 there are increasing numbers of sophisticated applications and examples of integrated hydrologic modelling engdahl and maxwell 2015 evaluated changes in the spatial distribution and flow paths of water in a high mountain headwaters watershed using an integrated hydrologic model based on a heterogeneous domain in the rocky mountains of colorado in the united states the simulations were performed using the parflow model kollet and maxwell 2006 fig 6 shows the hydraulic conductivity field in the model domain and simulated ponded water depth stream gauge for the base case scenario studied hwang et al 2019 estimated the influence of cumulative wastewater treatment plant discharge on acesulfame an artificial sweetener and escherichia coli in the mixed use highly impacted grand river watershed ontario canada using a fully integrated modelling approach the simulations were performed using hydrogeosphere aquanty com aquanty inc 2018 70 of the land area in the grand river watershed is used for agriculture it has a population of about one million people and there are 28 municipal wastewater treatment plants in the watershed the study by hwang et al 2019 is the largest scale integrated transport problem of which we are aware fig 7 shows the location of the watershed watershed topography and a subsection of the spatially varying finite element mesh within the 3d hydrogeosphere model the model reproduces observations fig 8 shows the simulated acesulfame concentrations along the length of the grand river demonstrating excellent agreement between simulated and measured concentrations chen et al 2019 developed an integrated hydrologic model for continental canada using hydrogeosphere that covers approximately 10 5 million km2 as a continental scale application it is one of the largest scale applications of integrated hydrologic modelling of which we are aware the model reproduces observations the model results are in very good agreement with observations of groundwater levels surface water flow rates and lake levels this powerful modelling study demonstrates that large scale fully integrated hydrologic modelling is possible and that it can be successfully used to quantify components of a large scale water balance which are difficult or impossible to quantify without modelling fig 9 shows a close up look at the 3d triangular prism grid along the great lakes region in this hydrogeosphere model the model includes significant topographic relief the irregular triangular mesh is refined along major rivers and at the lake shore inhm vanderkwaak 1999 vanderkwaak and loague 2001 simulations for the small rangeland catchment known as the r 5 catchment are shown in fig 10 loague et al 2005 this figure illustrates the spatial and temporal information generated using a physically based model that can be used to identify processes simulated hydrographs and surface soil water content through space and time are shown simulated hydrographs are compared with an observed hydrograph loague et al 2005 remarked physics based models have great diagnostic and forensic capabilities the integrated and distributed response of a coupled surface subsurface hydrological model for the des anglais catchment quebec was simulated with the cathy model camporese et al 2010 by sulis et al 2011a climate change impacts were assessed in the same catchment with a detailed hydrological model of surface subsurface interactions and comparison with a land surface model sulis et al 2011b fig 11 shows good agreement between the observed and simulated discharge at streamflow gauges in the catchment for the verification period the model employed by sulis et al 2011a and sulis et al 2011b is another example of a model that reproduces observations all of these recent studies and many others not shown here demonstrate that 3d fully coupled spatially distributed integrated hydrologic modelling is tractable reliable robust practical and useful it is also efficient and effective at large scales it is fascinating and perhaps a little amusing to compare the contemporary actual model domains and model discretisations in recent studies with the now quaint seemingly hand drawn original conceptualisation and digital model the artist s conception shown in fig 3 of the original freeze and harlan blueprint fig 3 of this paper put side by side the comparison of the modern digital implementation with the original hand drawings in the freeze and harlan blueprint is quite striking as freeze and harlan 1969 stated and we echo here our aim is not to promote a pet methodology or a pet blueprint but simply to recognise one approach that deserves increasing attention as part of the hydrologists toolbox simmons et al 2012 interestingly the original blueprint clearly articulated the various methods of hydrologic simulation based on amorocho and hart 1964 which include physical models physically based mathematical methods parametric methods and stochastic methods lumped and distributed models both spatially and sequentially were also mentioned by freeze and harlan 1969 all of these models and approaches have a time and place in the practice of hydrology 4 future challenges opportunities and new horizons the freeze and harlan 1969 blueprint has laid the foundations for an entire discipline of hydrologic science i e watershed modelling and a new generation of computer codes to simulate hydrologic phenomena as freeze and harlan 1969 p 242 noted if the model we espouse is to offer promise for the future it must be able to compete with the systems approach in terms of practical results and utility a case could then be made for its superiority on the basis that a better understanding of the internal processes and their effects on the overall hydrologic system is desirable and could be beneficial to the solution of practical problems we contend that the blueprint is currently practical and useful the prognosis for its continued and increasing use in the future is promising berg and sudicky 2019 it provides a robust tractable defensible and reliable ideological foundational basis for the development of integrated hydrological modelling and hydrological science the ways in which it is implemented through constituent processes and compartments and the vital coupling between them will necessarily continue to evolve there are enormous challenges and opportunities for this field of hydrological science many of these challenges and opportunities have been described elsewhere by others perhaps in different words but it is useful to summarise some salient points here as we reflect and prospect on the blueprint whilst the blueprint is seminal it is not timeless it was an idea as freeze himself noted in personal communications with us a main motive and contribution was to get disparate fields of hydrology groundwater and surface water hydrologists and soil scientists and atmospheric scientists talking and working together and to promote more integrated treatments the original blueprint noted challenges with data acquisition as well as our knowledge of physical hydrology and the individual hydrologic compartments whilst there have been many scientific advances in physical hydrology many of the problems noted in freeze and harlan 1969 remain true today our scientific knowledge is incomplete we still grapple with issues including for example heterogeneity and if and how to include small scale details in large scale models research that followed the advent of the blueprint has clarified the complexities of subsurface storm flow to streams preferential flow paths etc the freeze and harlan 1969 conceptual model is therefore now recognized as a somewhat simplistic first pass there are clearly situations as outlined earlier where the continuum approach does not work addressing the limitations of the original continuum blueprint are amongst the exciting and important areas for future research heterogeneities and preferential flows are not the only issues turbulent flow in karstic systems and influences of vegetation on changing soil and surface properties also need to be addressed these issues and how they are addressed will depend on a number of matters including for example the nature of the questions and problems that are being tackled the associated spatial and temporal scales whether one is dealing with a flow or transport problem and whether the system is transient or in steady state we have more data now than ever often in the public domain and there are papers showing the enormous potential to incorporate field based methods geochemistry and environment tracers schilling et al 2017 geostatistics parameter estimation techniques and uncertainty analysis berg et al 2019a miller et al 2018 into fully coupled physically based spatially distributed models brunner et al 2017 high performance computing and new types of data will be mainstays in the future of hydrologic science and the ever increasing uptake development application and evolution of the freeze and harlan 1969 blueprint our models are more computationally demanding now than ever yet recent strides in computational methods code parallelization and cloud computing have already enabled real time 3d forecasting of the surface and subsurface hydrologic regimes over large watersheds in an operational mode as driven by an ensemble of weather forecasts berg et al 2019b we anticipate the next generation of models with increased capabilities as codes such as hydrogeosphere aquanty com aquanty inc 2018 mike she abbott et al 1986 graham and butts 2005 and parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 continue to evolve parameter estimation uncertainty analysis data assimilation and data worth studies underpin smart efficient and effective data collection and modelling strategies they underpin risk based environmental decision making they involve massive amounts of model generated data determining appropriate model simplicity complexity is an ever present and ongoing challenge more data are becoming available for use in groundwater modelling and as vital input to the 21st century physically based digitally simulated hydrologic response model new and exciting extraordinary datasets are being collected from satellites e g gravity recovery and climate experiment follow on grace fo data for tracking earth s water movement across the planet including underground water storage and rich gis datasets for vegetation and soil types that have millions of data points in a layer big data perhaps something we thought we would never need to worry about in surface subsurface hydrologic science is something that we must now wrangle the purpose of the hydrologic response model developed by freeze and harlan 1969 was noted early in the original paper they were principally concerned with hydrologic events and natural and anthropogenic changes to the hydrologic regime the potential use of a hydrologic response model for understanding hydrology in general and runoff processes in particular were cited it is abundantly clear that the original paper was concerned with hydraulics and flow as we look to the future linking groundwater with soils surface water ecosystems and climate science in catchments and across the globe are exciting and foreseeable challenges a whole world of new disciplinary interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary problems is in sight contamination of water resources reactive transport processes and the impacts of hydrologic and water quality changes on sensitive ecological receptors belong on a very long list of contemporary pressing issues for modern day hydrology it is therefore clear that the blueprint will and must evolve with time reflecting new scientific advances as well as important and emerging water resources management and policy challenges several papers e g maxwell et al 2014 wu et al 2015 tian et al 2015 paniconi and putti 2015 have described the use and application of integrated models to study water resources environmental and interdisciplinary problems it is clear that the 21st century blueprint is already being realised integrated hydrologic models are being developed and applied to study the water quality in watersheds fonseca et al 2014 hwang et al 2019 the impact of climate change on hydrologic systems erler et al 2019 surfleet and tullos 2013 sulis et al 2011b the groundwater land surface atmosphere connection maxwell et al 2007 links between land use vegetation and hydrologic systems schilling et al 2014 banks et al 2011 coupling streambed hydraulic properties and surface water groundwater interactions simpson and meixner 2012 and regional scale water resources management wu et al 2015 tian et al 2015 hassanzadeh et al 2014 mazzega et al 2014 for example wu et al 2015 used a surrogate based approach with integrated surface water groundwater modelling for optimizing water resources management in a large river basin surrogate models and model emulation can be particularly important when the computational burden is prohibitive especially when many simulations must be run as a part of an optimisation or uncertainty analysis wu et al 2015 conclude that surrogate based approaches show promise for bridging the gap between complex environmental modelling and real world management decision making new social economic and environmental problems questions and issues will continue to drive changes in integrated hydrologic science and modelling whilst some of these drivers can be anticipated many are currently and inevitably unforeseeable 5 epilogue the freeze and harlan 1969 blueprint for a physically based digitally simulated hydrologic response model set firm and exciting foundations for some important developments in hydrologic science that occurred over the last 50 years our paper commemorates the 50th anniversary of this seminal paper we honour and remember allan freeze and dick harlan and thank them for their insights and wisdom and for conceiving their blueprint paper we traced the story of the blueprint paper from its earliest origins as it was developed in informal conversation between two friends who shared both an interest in hydrology and a car ride to work to its update development and application in proceeding decades to the birth of the computer codes that ultimately realised the physically based digitally simulated hydrologic response model and which made freeze and harlan s dream a reality within some 40 years of the publication of the original paper freeze and harlan s contribution is quite extraordinary given the state of hydrology in the 1960 s as well as both the limited computational power and limited data available then one can imagine two friends toying with an idea in the car on the way to work imagining what advances in computing over forthcoming decades may make possible for hydrologic modelling there are many challenges and opportunities that remain from working with big data and data assimilation as new and ever increasing datasets come into being to advances in high performance computing that will enable us to address new and exciting real world problems and continue to explore fundamental scientific phenomena and processes to new interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary problems that bring different often disparate areas of science and modelling together the opportunities and need for groundwater hydrologists surface water hydrologists soil physicists climatologists ecologists amongst others to work together and collaborate to solve a plethora of interesting important exciting and emerging problems have never been greater as freeze observed in communications with us getting different hydrologists talking and working together was a main contribution and motivation of the original blueprint today we can add to the list of disciplines contributing to the much needed interdisciplinary effort water quality ecology ecotoxicology and climate science are critically among the growing mix the future of groundwater science and groundwater modelling as part of a broader hydrological geological and environmental enterprise will depend on advancing and resolving many exciting challenges the future of groundwater science and groundwater modelling will depend on advancing the blueprint in both conceptual and implementation terms as allan freeze remarked in communication with us certainly our paper was very much a first pass and really just an idea piece it has set the stage for the next generation of blueprints scientific advances and management applications it has triggered important scientific discussion and debate today it is abundantly clear that we stand on the shoulders of giants in 2019 the 50th anniversary of the blueprint paper we celebrate and commemorate the blueprint paper its authors allan freeze and dick harlan for conceiving the blueprint and all of the people too many to name who have been central to this story over the last 50 years and instrumental in its uptake from code developers to model users to researchers and practitioners who have refined advanced developed implemented and applied the blueprint we look forward with great interest to the next 50 years and to watching how the blueprint this field of science and its allied problems and applications continue to evolve we surmise the prognosis for the future adaptation evolution and application of the freeze and harlan blueprint is promising not bad for a first pass and idea piece declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments we remember and thank allan freeze and dick harlan the authors of the original blueprint paper the

model intercomparison studies provide a synopsis of a number of contemporary integrated surface subsurface flow models maxwell et al 2014 kollet et al 2017 maxwell et al 2014 discuss the important differences in coupling strategies and solution techniques that are employed by integrated models our paper commemorates the 50 year anniversary of the original blueprint paper through personal communications with allan freeze we document the history and genesis of this paper for the first time we reflect on the uptake of the blueprint into modern hydrology the development of numerical models that enabled this and the range of challenges being tackled by these models these challenges range from fundamental and theoretical discoveries about hydrologic processes to advanced applications that support water resources management finally we consider challenges and opportunities for the future of this area of modelling and hydrological science this paper is deliberately strategic philosophical historical and prospective we highlight some key points in the scientific evolution of this field and discuss their significance it is not a comprehensive review and references cited are therefore demonstrative rather than exhaustive 2 genesis of the blueprint circa 1968 1969 we begin with an historical account of the genesis of the paper which is faithfully reproduced from discussions and written communications we have had directly with allan freeze one of the original blueprint authors his co author richard lee harlan passed away in 2011 we provide first person personal communications from allan freeze to enable historical veracity and authenticity according to allan freeze also a co author of the widely known textbook groundwater freeze and cherry 1979 dick harlan and i met serendipitously not through any official professional connection but because he and his wife sandra and my wife donna and i lived in the same apartment building in calgary alberta we were both new to calgary and both of us were living temporarily in the apartment while we awaited the completion of our new houses both then under construction i had worked as a research scientist for the federal groundwater group for a few years and had recently been posted to the calgary office at that time part of the department of energy mines and resources later to be annexed into environment canada dick was an american from michigan if i remember correctly who had just been hired as a research hydrologist with the department of forestry and fisheries so we did not work for the same agency but our offices were close together and we often carpooled to work together it was during these rides that we discovered our mutual interest in computer simulations of hydrologic processes and began talking about the issues that eventually led to our joint paper the main contribution of the paper in my opinion was in getting hydrologists of all stripes interested in meeting and working with each other modern researchers will find it quaintly amusing how little interaction there was in 1969 between groundwater and surface water hydrologists each lived on their own desert islands separate associations separate associate editors at water resources research and journal of hydrology separate sessions at the american geophysical union fall meeting and seldom the twain met even when i was editor of water resources research from 1976 to 1980 i was always surprised at how naive the treatment of groundwater was in surface water papers and vice versa there were few papers that actually married the diverse components of the hydrologic cycle in any meaningful way i think much credit should be given to peter eagleson of mit and his book dynamic hydrology published in 1970 for turning the tide see eagleson 1970 r allan freeze was born in edmonton alberta on may 23 1939 he obtained both m sc and ph d degrees from the university of california berkeley he worked for the canadian government the ibm thomas j watson research center and was later a professor in the department of geological sciences at the university of british colombia freeze has received many awards for his work he is a fellow of the royal society of canada a member of the canadian academy of engineering and a foreign member of the national academy of engineering in the us he holds many other awards from professional societies freeze has wide ranging interests and hobbies he has published on the statistics of baseball batting orders freeze 1974 he is also the author of two popular science books the environmental pendulum a quest for the truth about toxic chemicals human health and environmental protection freeze 2000 and the fluoride wars how a modest public health measure became america s longest running political melodrama freeze and lehr 2009 freeze also shared a little bit more about his recent history he remarked i am alive and well in my retirement in vancouver still writing popular science as a hobby golfing to a 14 handicap not bad for a recently turned octagenarian and playing duplicate bridge regularly with my wife of 58 years as for dick he left the research world a few years after our joint paper and worked for several years for a consulting engineering company in denver colorado sadly he passed away many years ago at much too early an age fig 1a shows allan freeze and craig simmons on november 28 2018 in adelaide australia freeze also provided us with some information on dick harlan and their connection following the publication of the blueprint freeze described the period following the blueprint paper there is very little further of a joint biographical nature to disclose shortly after our blueprint paper i moved from calgary to join the ibm thomas j watson research center in yorktown heights ny and although we kept in touch we never did any joint work again we were able to glean a bit more information on dick harlan from allan freeze and from dick harlan s online obituary https horancares com obits richard l harlan richard lee harlan was born in denver colorado on july 7 1939 and died nov 15 2011 age 72 he obtained his ph d in hydrogeology from michigan state university he worked in calgary alberta and ottawa ontario for the canadian department forestry and fisheries for 15 years he then worked for 11 years as chief hydrogeologist in the denver colorado office of the american consulting firm dames and moore dick harlan was american and freeze remarked in communications with us that he was not sure why or how harlan decided to come to canada a copy of the picture of harlan from the online obituary is found in fig 1b we are not sure of the exact year this photo was taken from discussions with freeze we guess that it was probably taken a year or so before harlan s death in 2011 3 realising a dream the last 50 years 1969 2019 freeze and harlan had a dream as they carpooled they imagined a virtual hydrologic laboratory a physically based digital modelling world where important hydrologic processes and groundwater flow and surface water flow rainfall evaporation runoff recharge to groundwater could be modelled at a hydrologic basin scale their original paper was concerned with flows and hydraulics water quantities rates and flow pathways fig 2 shows the abstract from the original paper fig 3 shows fig 2 from freeze and harlan 1969 illustrating a hydrologic basin and a three dimensional nodal grid of that hydrologic basin a graphic form that nicely captures the overarching vision set out in the original blueprint paper freeze and harlan 1969 were clear about their motives their purpose was not to create an emotional pitch for a pet methodology but rather to examine the possibility of creating physically based hydrologic response models italics are freeze and harlan s own emphasis they noted that a complete simulator for the hydrologic cycle tantalizes most hydrologists but they also observed issues and limitations drawing upon comments from amorocho and hart 1964 and crawford and linsley 1966 these limitations included a lack of knowledge of physical hydrology and component phenomena as well as the prohibitive amounts of input data that would be required to realise the blueprint in practice they conceded that their paper was more of an artist s conception than a true blueprint freeze and harlan 1969 p 238 to appreciate the computational vision implicit in the original blueprint one must imagine the time when freeze and harlan wrote this paper the first paper to present a digital groundwater model was by tyson and weber 1964 george pinder and john bredehoeft had also just published a paper on the development of a digital groundwater model pinder and bredehoeft 1968 their model was verified using electrical low pass rc filter analogs for groundwater flow modelling that were still in vogue at the time these were the waning days of electrical resistor capacitor networks used to simulate groundwater flow there is a classic photo of arlan harbaugh co author of the usgs model modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 simulating groundwater at long island new york with a big electrical resistor capacitor network the size of a room fig 4 freeze and harlan noted that based on forsythe and wasow 1960 a time dependent boundary value problem in three dimensions could be tackled in moderate detail using a 100 100 100 nodal array they went on to ask what then of the machines of the 1970 s this prescient question anticipates the exciting future possibilities that growth in computer power was very likely to bring it also suggests that the authors were aware of the distinct possibility that their 1969 artist s conception could become the real world digital simulation of the future the earliest application of a blueprint based model was by freeze 1972 for a synthetic catchment the simulations were undertaken on the ibm 360 91 when freeze was working at the ibm thomas j watson research center at yorktown heights new york with a memory of 1 5 106 bytes of storage the ibm 360 91 was one of the most powerful computers then available nevertheless the spatial extent of the flow domain was limited and only a coarse mesh could be employed the first field application of this blueprint based model was to a hillslope in the sleepers river catchment in idaho stephenson and freeze 1974 keith beven beven 1975 developed a model based on the blueprint for his ph d thesis and applied it to the small east twin catchment in the uk this model was based on a hillslope segment width averaged finite element solutions rather than the finite difference structures presented in the blueprint this solution method enabled the hillslopes to look more like real hillslopes since those earliest applications the blueprint has been implemented in a growing number of integrated numerical models the surface subsurface model intercomparison study by maxwell et al 2014 clearly explains the classification of coupled hydrologic models based on the solution technique or coupling strategy that is employed they defined three approaches for solving the coupled system of equations i e the solution technique namely asynchronous linking sequential iteration and globally implicit in terms of coupling strategy they described three distinct formulations for integrating hydrostatic surface and subsurface flow namely first order exchange continuity of pressure and boundary condition switching integrated models have allowed progress on many scientific and engineering matters they have been used to study a wide range of purely theoretical to highly applied problems the application of the blueprint includes the exploration of fundamental hydrologic phenomena to advance physical hydrology freeze 1972 beven 1977 brunner and simmons 2012 to the coupling among atmospheric surface and subsurface processes e g davison et al 2018 an example of the exploration of hydrologic phenomena is the series of papers by keith loague and colleagues on the r 5 catchment oklahoma where progressively more detailed event based simulations were conducted resulting in changes in the simulated near surface response loague et al 2005 excellent review articles citing numerous studies ranging from water resources management to the coupling between soil biota or the cryosphere to mention a few examples include paniconi and putti 2015 one precondition for these applications was the significant increase in computational power kollet et al 2010 for example used 16 384 processors with about 8 109 nearly 10 billion grid cells to solve what is essentially the freeze and harlan problem their application was for a watershed on the order of 103 km2 expansions and extensions of the original blueprint have also been proposed for example partington et al 2017 proposed a framework to couple sedimentological hydrological and hydrogeological processes in streambeds the blueprint has not been without controversy criticism and debate loague and ebel 2016 earliest model applications in real field settings were not particularly successful stephenson and freeze 1974 beven 2001 2002 stephenson and freeze 1974 were amongst the earliest scientists to document challenges with the validation of hydrological models beven 2002 beven 2002 questioned the suitability of the blueprint to simulate hydrological response functions more specifically beven 1989 2002 states that darcian theory and in particular the richards equation are not appropriate to describe unsaturated subsurface flow at large scales because of heterogeneity and preferential flow paths beven 2002 does not really argue against the blueprint as a conceptual framework for catchment modelling in terms of processes he argues against the suitability of the commonly used continuum differential equations in implementing that framework there are clearly scales where the continuum approach darcian implementation simply will not work the assumption that small scale measurements apply at any scale is also clearly problematic beven and germann 2013 note that numerous extensions to richards equation have been proposed to account for preferential flow but that there is no rigorous physical underpinning to richards equation and that bolting on preferential flow capabilities is thus problematic we still have no generally applicable scale independent description of soil water flows that can be considered adequate continuum or not a universal scale independent description for dealing with such scaling would be an important evolution of the blueprint however the main contribution of the blueprint was to couple the surface with the subsurface in order to overcome the conceptual separation between the two hydrologic domains extending or replacing the conceptualization of individual processes such as unsaturated flow evapotranspiration infiltration even groundwater flow or the coupling between the surface and subsurface domain would constitute an evolution of the blueprint and its primary strategic intent changing the individual constituent process descriptions does not ipso facto undermine or invalidate the principal philosophy or motivation of the blueprint strictly speaking however whether the original blueprint is undermined or invalidated depends on whether one considers the blueprint to be intrinsically linked to continuum differential equations a continuum blueprint or not and the mathematical formulations presented in the original blueprint we do not see them as intrinsically linked our view appears to be consistent with freeze s own view when he remarks the purpose of the paper was not to get every mechanism in the hydrologic cycle dead to rights but rather to promote more integrated treatments we also assert that there are many situations where the continuum approach is valid and effective numerous modelling studies several of which are described in this paper demonstrate that integrated modelling produces results that are consistent with observations at the representative scale of the problem under consideration obviously integrated modelling that applies the blueprint philosophy must always exercise care and caution an appropriate objective for the study and the model that is employed must be defined the model s formulation and assumptions including conceptualisation and governing equations must clearly be appropriate to ensure robust and reliable results that meet the modelling objectives and to ensure consistency with observations at the scale of interest this applies to all modelling and not just integrated modelling beven 2002 also criticizes the term physically based while acknowledging that the blueprint is derived deductively from established physical principles he highlights that physically based should also imply consistency with observations which according to beven is not the case for the blueprint based models beven 2002 speculated that the original blueprint or perhaps more specifically the continuum differential equation approach presented in the original blueprint will eventually be abandoned beven 2002 proposed the concept of an alternative blueprint which is consistent with observations at the scale of interest recent review papers paniconi and putti 2015 barthel and banzhaf 2016 clark et al 2017 on blueprint based models however indicate that there are a growing number of applications linked to observable field data in addition to the application of blueprint based models to explore fundamental physics the significant developments in data acquisition data assimilation kurtz et al 2017 and the subsequent integration with model calibration schilling et al 2019 will certainly continue in the future data assimilation and model surrogacy can be a way of correcting and compensating for a model s deficiencies as is regularly done in weather forecasting it is useful for operational purposes however data assimilation and computational advances cannot by themselves be the basis for understanding and advancing fundamental physics although numerous challenges clearly do remain current citation data and contemporary applications suggest growth in the interest and importance of spatially distributed physically based hydrologic modelling citation data for freeze and harlan 1969 plotted as cumulative citations over time fig 5 show a large growth in citations with time the data in this figure were accessed from google scholar on 6 september 2019 when the total citation count was 736 there are increasing numbers of sophisticated applications and examples of integrated hydrologic modelling engdahl and maxwell 2015 evaluated changes in the spatial distribution and flow paths of water in a high mountain headwaters watershed using an integrated hydrologic model based on a heterogeneous domain in the rocky mountains of colorado in the united states the simulations were performed using the parflow model kollet and maxwell 2006 fig 6 shows the hydraulic conductivity field in the model domain and simulated ponded water depth stream gauge for the base case scenario studied hwang et al 2019 estimated the influence of cumulative wastewater treatment plant discharge on acesulfame an artificial sweetener and escherichia coli in the mixed use highly impacted grand river watershed ontario canada using a fully integrated modelling approach the simulations were performed using hydrogeosphere aquanty com aquanty inc 2018 70 of the land area in the grand river watershed is used for agriculture it has a population of about one million people and there are 28 municipal wastewater treatment plants in the watershed the study by hwang et al 2019 is the largest scale integrated transport problem of which we are aware fig 7 shows the location of the watershed watershed topography and a subsection of the spatially varying finite element mesh within the 3d hydrogeosphere model the model reproduces observations fig 8 shows the simulated acesulfame concentrations along the length of the grand river demonstrating excellent agreement between simulated and measured concentrations chen et al 2019 developed an integrated hydrologic model for continental canada using hydrogeosphere that covers approximately 10 5 million km2 as a continental scale application it is one of the largest scale applications of integrated hydrologic modelling of which we are aware the model reproduces observations the model results are in very good agreement with observations of groundwater levels surface water flow rates and lake levels this powerful modelling study demonstrates that large scale fully integrated hydrologic modelling is possible and that it can be successfully used to quantify components of a large scale water balance which are difficult or impossible to quantify without modelling fig 9 shows a close up look at the 3d triangular prism grid along the great lakes region in this hydrogeosphere model the model includes significant topographic relief the irregular triangular mesh is refined along major rivers and at the lake shore inhm vanderkwaak 1999 vanderkwaak and loague 2001 simulations for the small rangeland catchment known as the r 5 catchment are shown in fig 10 loague et al 2005 this figure illustrates the spatial and temporal information generated using a physically based model that can be used to identify processes simulated hydrographs and surface soil water content through space and time are shown simulated hydrographs are compared with an observed hydrograph loague et al 2005 remarked physics based models have great diagnostic and forensic capabilities the integrated and distributed response of a coupled surface subsurface hydrological model for the des anglais catchment quebec was simulated with the cathy model camporese et al 2010 by sulis et al 2011a climate change impacts were assessed in the same catchment with a detailed hydrological model of surface subsurface interactions and comparison with a land surface model sulis et al 2011b fig 11 shows good agreement between the observed and simulated discharge at streamflow gauges in the catchment for the verification period the model employed by sulis et al 2011a and sulis et al 2011b is another example of a model that reproduces observations all of these recent studies and many others not shown here demonstrate that 3d fully coupled spatially distributed integrated hydrologic modelling is tractable reliable robust practical and useful it is also efficient and effective at large scales it is fascinating and perhaps a little amusing to compare the contemporary actual model domains and model discretisations in recent studies with the now quaint seemingly hand drawn original conceptualisation and digital model the artist s conception shown in fig 3 of the original freeze and harlan blueprint fig 3 of this paper put side by side the comparison of the modern digital implementation with the original hand drawings in the freeze and harlan blueprint is quite striking as freeze and harlan 1969 stated and we echo here our aim is not to promote a pet methodology or a pet blueprint but simply to recognise one approach that deserves increasing attention as part of the hydrologists toolbox simmons et al 2012 interestingly the original blueprint clearly articulated the various methods of hydrologic simulation based on amorocho and hart 1964 which include physical models physically based mathematical methods parametric methods and stochastic methods lumped and distributed models both spatially and sequentially were also mentioned by freeze and harlan 1969 all of these models and approaches have a time and place in the practice of hydrology 4 future challenges opportunities and new horizons the freeze and harlan 1969 blueprint has laid the foundations for an entire discipline of hydrologic science i e watershed modelling and a new generation of computer codes to simulate hydrologic phenomena as freeze and harlan 1969 p 242 noted if the model we espouse is to offer promise for the future it must be able to compete with the systems approach in terms of practical results and utility a case could then be made for its superiority on the basis that a better understanding of the internal processes and their effects on the overall hydrologic system is desirable and could be beneficial to the solution of practical problems we contend that the blueprint is currently practical and useful the prognosis for its continued and increasing use in the future is promising berg and sudicky 2019 it provides a robust tractable defensible and reliable ideological foundational basis for the development of integrated hydrological modelling and hydrological science the ways in which it is implemented through constituent processes and compartments and the vital coupling between them will necessarily continue to evolve there are enormous challenges and opportunities for this field of hydrological science many of these challenges and opportunities have been described elsewhere by others perhaps in different words but it is useful to summarise some salient points here as we reflect and prospect on the blueprint whilst the blueprint is seminal it is not timeless it was an idea as freeze himself noted in personal communications with us a main motive and contribution was to get disparate fields of hydrology groundwater and surface water hydrologists and soil scientists and atmospheric scientists talking and working together and to promote more integrated treatments the original blueprint noted challenges with data acquisition as well as our knowledge of physical hydrology and the individual hydrologic compartments whilst there have been many scientific advances in physical hydrology many of the problems noted in freeze and harlan 1969 remain true today our scientific knowledge is incomplete we still grapple with issues including for example heterogeneity and if and how to include small scale details in large scale models research that followed the advent of the blueprint has clarified the complexities of subsurface storm flow to streams preferential flow paths etc the freeze and harlan 1969 conceptual model is therefore now recognized as a somewhat simplistic first pass there are clearly situations as outlined earlier where the continuum approach does not work addressing the limitations of the original continuum blueprint are amongst the exciting and important areas for future research heterogeneities and preferential flows are not the only issues turbulent flow in karstic systems and influences of vegetation on changing soil and surface properties also need to be addressed these issues and how they are addressed will depend on a number of matters including for example the nature of the questions and problems that are being tackled the associated spatial and temporal scales whether one is dealing with a flow or transport problem and whether the system is transient or in steady state we have more data now than ever often in the public domain and there are papers showing the enormous potential to incorporate field based methods geochemistry and environment tracers schilling et al 2017 geostatistics parameter estimation techniques and uncertainty analysis berg et al 2019a miller et al 2018 into fully coupled physically based spatially distributed models brunner et al 2017 high performance computing and new types of data will be mainstays in the future of hydrologic science and the ever increasing uptake development application and evolution of the freeze and harlan 1969 blueprint our models are more computationally demanding now than ever yet recent strides in computational methods code parallelization and cloud computing have already enabled real time 3d forecasting of the surface and subsurface hydrologic regimes over large watersheds in an operational mode as driven by an ensemble of weather forecasts berg et al 2019b we anticipate the next generation of models with increased capabilities as codes such as hydrogeosphere aquanty com aquanty inc 2018 mike she abbott et al 1986 graham and butts 2005 and parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 continue to evolve parameter estimation uncertainty analysis data assimilation and data worth studies underpin smart efficient and effective data collection and modelling strategies they underpin risk based environmental decision making they involve massive amounts of model generated data determining appropriate model simplicity complexity is an ever present and ongoing challenge more data are becoming available for use in groundwater modelling and as vital input to the 21st century physically based digitally simulated hydrologic response model new and exciting extraordinary datasets are being collected from satellites e g gravity recovery and climate experiment follow on grace fo data for tracking earth s water movement across the planet including underground water storage and rich gis datasets for vegetation and soil types that have millions of data points in a layer big data perhaps something we thought we would never need to worry about in surface subsurface hydrologic science is something that we must now wrangle the purpose of the hydrologic response model developed by freeze and harlan 1969 was noted early in the original paper they were principally concerned with hydrologic events and natural and anthropogenic changes to the hydrologic regime the potential use of a hydrologic response model for understanding hydrology in general and runoff processes in particular were cited it is abundantly clear that the original paper was concerned with hydraulics and flow as we look to the future linking groundwater with soils surface water ecosystems and climate science in catchments and across the globe are exciting and foreseeable challenges a whole world of new disciplinary interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary problems is in sight contamination of water resources reactive transport processes and the impacts of hydrologic and water quality changes on sensitive ecological receptors belong on a very long list of contemporary pressing issues for modern day hydrology it is therefore clear that the blueprint will and must evolve with time reflecting new scientific advances as well as important and emerging water resources management and policy challenges several papers e g maxwell et al 2014 wu et al 2015 tian et al 2015 paniconi and putti 2015 have described the use and application of integrated models to study water resources environmental and interdisciplinary problems it is clear that the 21st century blueprint is already being realised integrated hydrologic models are being developed and applied to study the water quality in watersheds fonseca et al 2014 hwang et al 2019 the impact of climate change on hydrologic systems erler et al 2019 surfleet and tullos 2013 sulis et al 2011b the groundwater land surface atmosphere connection maxwell et al 2007 links between land use vegetation and hydrologic systems schilling et al 2014 banks et al 2011 coupling streambed hydraulic properties and surface water groundwater interactions simpson and meixner 2012 and regional scale water resources management wu et al 2015 tian et al 2015 hassanzadeh et al 2014 mazzega et al 2014 for example wu et al 2015 used a surrogate based approach with integrated surface water groundwater modelling for optimizing water resources management in a large river basin surrogate models and model emulation can be particularly important when the computational burden is prohibitive especially when many simulations must be run as a part of an optimisation or uncertainty analysis wu et al 2015 conclude that surrogate based approaches show promise for bridging the gap between complex environmental modelling and real world management decision making new social economic and environmental problems questions and issues will continue to drive changes in integrated hydrologic science and modelling whilst some of these drivers can be anticipated many are currently and inevitably unforeseeable 5 epilogue the freeze and harlan 1969 blueprint for a physically based digitally simulated hydrologic response model set firm and exciting foundations for some important developments in hydrologic science that occurred over the last 50 years our paper commemorates the 50th anniversary of this seminal paper we honour and remember allan freeze and dick harlan and thank them for their insights and wisdom and for conceiving their blueprint paper we traced the story of the blueprint paper from its earliest origins as it was developed in informal conversation between two friends who shared both an interest in hydrology and a car ride to work to its update development and application in proceeding decades to the birth of the computer codes that ultimately realised the physically based digitally simulated hydrologic response model and which made freeze and harlan s dream a reality within some 40 years of the publication of the original paper freeze and harlan s contribution is quite extraordinary given the state of hydrology in the 1960 s as well as both the limited computational power and limited data available then one can imagine two friends toying with an idea in the car on the way to work imagining what advances in computing over forthcoming decades may make possible for hydrologic modelling there are many challenges and opportunities that remain from working with big data and data assimilation as new and ever increasing datasets come into being to advances in high performance computing that will enable us to address new and exciting real world problems and continue to explore fundamental scientific phenomena and processes to new interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary problems that bring different often disparate areas of science and modelling together the opportunities and need for groundwater hydrologists surface water hydrologists soil physicists climatologists ecologists amongst others to work together and collaborate to solve a plethora of interesting important exciting and emerging problems have never been greater as freeze observed in communications with us getting different hydrologists talking and working together was a main contribution and motivation of the original blueprint today we can add to the list of disciplines contributing to the much needed interdisciplinary effort water quality ecology ecotoxicology and climate science are critically among the growing mix the future of groundwater science and groundwater modelling as part of a broader hydrological geological and environmental enterprise will depend on advancing and resolving many exciting challenges the future of groundwater science and groundwater modelling will depend on advancing the blueprint in both conceptual and implementation terms as allan freeze remarked in communication with us certainly our paper was very much a first pass and really just an idea piece it has set the stage for the next generation of blueprints scientific advances and management applications it has triggered important scientific discussion and debate today it is abundantly clear that we stand on the shoulders of giants in 2019 the 50th anniversary of the blueprint paper we celebrate and commemorate the blueprint paper its authors allan freeze and dick harlan for conceiving the blueprint and all of the people too many to name who have been central to this story over the last 50 years and instrumental in its uptake from code developers to model users to researchers and practitioners who have refined advanced developed implemented and applied the blueprint we look forward with great interest to the next 50 years and to watching how the blueprint this field of science and its allied problems and applications continue to evolve we surmise the prognosis for the future adaptation evolution and application of the freeze and harlan blueprint is promising not bad for a first pass and idea piece declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments we remember and thank allan freeze and dick harlan the authors of the original blueprint paper the authors truly appreciate allan freeze s time advice and important contributions to this manuscript we are grateful for allan s generosity to help make this paper possible we were grateful to hear allan s story firsthand and to have the opportunity to reminisce with him about the historical freeze and harlan parts of this paper the historical perspective is important to document for future generations allan s involvement was crucial for ensuring that the historical parts of the story are faithfully reported we thank the editor in chief at journal of hydrology professor geoff syme for supporting us to pursue this idea for a commemorative paper we thank steve berg for his assistance in preparing citation data for the paper we thank mary anderson keith beven and ghislain de marsily

5682,drought is one of the most disastrous natural phenomena that causes scarcity and lack of water in hydrological basins and affects seriously the majority of the population in many ways such as economical social and environmental therefore drought plays a significant role in the risk management of water resources systems the purpose of this study is to develop the severity intensity duration frequency curves based on precipitation deficit and provide a comprehensive characterization of droughts by using standardized precipitation index spi which considers precipitation data only instead of using spi directly the severity and intensity were calculated in the duration frequency curves on the other hand spi is a technical tool and thus difficult to understand at first glance by end users and decision makers precipitation deficit is therefore more useful and physically meaningful to the users in this study drought with the largest severity in each year is defined as the critical drought of the year frequency analysis is applied on the critical drought severity to determine the best fit probability distribution function by using the total probability theorem results show that the 2 year return period drought severity intensity duration frequency curve is well lower than and separated clearly from the curves at higher return periods of 5 100 years although it has the same tendency with the longer return period curves and also that almost no difference is observed between the precipitation deficit of the droughts of 25 years or longer return periods with the precipitation deficit and such newly introduced concepts as critical drought severity singular drought and within period drought the proposed methodology gains a novelty it is expected that the destructive and irreversible effects of meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts can be realized in a more physical sense with the use of precipitation deficit keywords critical drought severity intensity severity intensity duration frequency curve singular drought standardized precipitation index within period drought 1 introduction according to the united nations convention to combat desertification in those countries experiencing serious drought and or desertification drought means the naturally occurring phenomenon that exists when precipitation has been significantly below normal recorded levels causing serious hydrological imbalances that adversely affect land resource production systems un 1994 drought has an impact on a large number of areas since water is the source of life and this makes it harder to point one certain definition for the drought geophysicists engineers economists agriculturists and all water users have their own conception of drought since they have different points of view and different conditions of operation yevjevich 1967 as wilhite and glantz 1985 stated it is neither possible nor beneficial to find a universal definition of drought but there are sub definitions which can be categorized according to the disciplinary perspective as meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic water scarcity becomes more effective with the presence of droughts riebsame et al 1991 bates et al 2008 yet drought is probably among the least understood hazards hagman 1984 because of its random and complex behavior this is why there still exists a great demand for research on drought in the scientific community mishra and singh 2011 indicators are used in drought analysis they are precipitation for meteorological drought soil moisture and crop yield for agricultural drought and streamflow reservoir level lake water level and groundwater level for hydrological drought mishra and singh 2010 using the indicators drought indices are quantified a quite high number of drought indices is available in the literature for the assessment of the drought a few commonly used drought indices are the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 crop moisture index cmi palmer 1968 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 soil moisture drought index smdi hollinger et al 1993 vegetation condition index vci liu and kogan 1996 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 among which spi has been the most common as it is suggested by the world meteorological organization wmo 2012 to the meteorological organizations of member states as a standard for drought characterization for a detailed discussion on drought indices see heim 2002 and mishra and singh 2010 also a review paper on drought characterization from a multivariate perspective and the development of different methods for multivariate drought indices is available hao and singh 2015 two basic parameters which are essential to characterize a drought are the duration and the severity the duration of a drought is the expression of how long the deficit of water continues while the severity refers to the degree of the deficit the ratio of the severity to the duration is called intensity another significant drought characteristic is the frequency or return period which is defined as the number of drought events in a given time period or indicated by the average time between the occurrence of subsequent drought events with a certain magnitude or less haan 1977 in the literature there have been limitless studies on the drought characterization among which dalezios et al 2001 tsakiris and vangelis 2005 nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 vicente serrano et al 2010 santos et al 2011 tigkas et al 2015 yacoub and tayfur 2017 can be mentioned on the other hand there has been significant number of research studies on the probabilistic characterization of droughts since yevjevich 1967 introduced the run theory as a drought is a probabilistic multivariate process sen 1976 loaiciga and leipnik 1996 chung and salas 2000 mishra and singh 2009 although frequency analysis is one of the most common and earliest applications in hydrology and it is therefore significant its sole use become insufficient for drought studies unless it is numerically related to other factors such as the severity duration and intensity rahmat et al 2015 dracup et al 1980 rossi et al 1992 loaiciga and leipnik 1996 mishra and singh 2011 zarch et al 2015 investigated the changes in drought characteristics on different arid regions with and without consideration of potential evapotranspiration an important tool in drought studies is the sdf curve that accommodates the interrelation between the severity duration and frequency of drought occurrence from which drought with a certain severity and return period can be determined dalezios et al 2001 rahmat et al 2015 except for the recent study by aksoy et al 2018a b limited to four hydrological basins drought sdf or intensity duration frequency idf curves have not been yet investigated in turkey drought has so far been analyzed mainly by spi instead turkes and tatli 2009 bacanli 2017 dabanli et al 2017 as a different approximation aksoy et al 2018b and cetin et al 2018 derived precipitation deficit from the sdf curves for the drought characterization by using frequency analysis while cavus and aksoy 2019 performed a spatial drought analysis for a river basin in southern turkey the objective of this study is to derive station based severity intensity duration frequency sdf idf curves to quantify the recurrence intervals of droughts based on precipitation deficit a concept newly introduced in this study the focus of the study in terms of the methodology is based on the total probability theorem applied on the critical drought severity by using spi the sdf idf curves are developed in terms of precipitation deficit a case study on monthly precipitation data from adana meteorological station in seyhan river basin in southern turkey was performed to present the results of the proposed methodology 2 standardized precipitation index a variety of indices for characterizing drought have been devised which are in general all data demanding with high computational cost precipitation dependent drought indices assume that either the change of other climatological and meteorological variables is insignificant or is a known function of precipitation change among them spi mckee et al 1993 is the simplest one needing monthly precipitation data only however it allows to use precipitation for different time scales which are commonly taken as k 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 months typically precipitation data do not have a normal probability distribution but this can be overcome by applying a transformation to the precipitation dataset in calculating the spi values the gamma probability distribution function is transformed into the standard normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance the spi is then basically obtained from the transformation of the gamma distributed precipitation into the standard normal variable given as 1 spi ij x ij μ j σ j where x ij is precipitation at month j of year i μ j is monthly mean precipitation at month j and σ j is standard deviation of precipitation at month j spi over short term periods up to k 3 months is appropriate for measuring short term impacts on soil moisture snowpack and streamflow of small rivers spi calculated over medium term periods k 3 12 months i e spi3 to spi12 is appropriate for measuring the impact on streamflow and reservoir storage spi for longer term periods k 12 24 months is the best for assessing long term processes such as groundwater recharge mckee et al 1993 spi1 and spi3 are generally assumed to represent meteorological drought while spi6 and spi9 are considerable for agricultural drought and longer time scales such as spi12 and spi24 are proposed for hydrological drought using the methodology of spi drought indices can be calculated for other hydrological variables such as streamflow groundwater reservoir and snowpack nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 bloomfield and marchant 2013 3 basic concepts and definitions a dry period begins immediately when the spi falls below zero droughts are determined from the dry periods and drought characteristics such as the duration severity intensity and return period are calculated the concepts used in this study are defined as follows a dry period length l the cluster which consists of consecutive negative values of spi refers to as the dry period fig 1 it begins in a month with a negative spi and continue until a positive spi value is obtained in the time series a dry period is shown as 2 a s p i s p i 0 where s a is the number of elements of set a that shows the length of the dry period as 3 l s a which is determined as a fixed value for each dry period b drought duration d duration of droughts in a dry period with length l is 0 d l fig 1 it should be emphasized that the dry period and drought are two similar but different concepts the former has a fixed length while the later has a changing duration in order to make the distinction between the dry period and the drought clear the new concepts introduced in this study the within period drought and singular drought are immediately defined c within period drought any drought with a duration shorter than the length of dry period is called within period drought for example in a dry period of 3 month long there are three 1 month droughts and two 2 month droughts similarly there are two 1 month droughts in a dry period of 2 month long d singular drought drought that extends over the dry period is called a singular drought for example there exists a 1 month singular drought in a dry period of 1 month long a 2 month singular drought in a dry period of 2 month long a 3 month singular drought in a dry period of 3 month long and so on the length of dry period becomes the same as the drought duration for singular droughts while the former is larger than the latter for within period droughts e drought severity s the accumulation of negative spi values preceded and followed by positive spi values is called severity if it is considered in terms of absolute values the severity of a drought d month long is calculated by 4 s i 1 d spi i spi i a in other words the severity is the largest absolute value of the cumulative drought index spi in this study for each drought duration f drought intensity i the intensity is obtained by dividing the severity to the drought duration as 5 i s d g critical drought severity when more than one drought is recorded for any year drought with maximum severity is taken as the critical drought no critical drought is assigned to a year in which drought is not observed h no drought year any year with no negative run of spi is considered a year with no drought thus the critical drought severity is not calculated for such a year a zero value is assigned to the critical drought severity an assumption has been made in this study such that only one drought is accounted per a year it is called critical drought which is the most severe in terms of its severity over the drought duration droughts are assigned to the months they end this is applied also to over year droughts that start in one year and end in another year for example a 3 month drought period from june to august both inclusive was assigned to august this is applied also to the over year droughts i e a drought that starts in march and ends in august next year is considered as an 18 month drought of august of the next year as expected no drought might be observed in some years for the selected drought duration which means the severity is zero the zero severity values were considered in the development of the drought sdf curve by using the total probability theorem applicable to intermittent censored time series haan 1977 here further definitions are required the first among them is the critical precipitation the precipitation that corresponds to the critical drought severity values similarly precipitation corresponding to spi 0 is called precipitation threshold the difference between the precipitation threshold and the critical precipitation the precipitation deficit and its ratio to the drought duration the intensity deficit are calculated 4 methodology methodology proposed in this study uses monthly precipitation data of a single meteorological station as the input and plots the sdf and idf curves of critical droughts as the final outputs fig 2 the spi is the start point of the methodology which is considered for time scales k 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 months the spi time series is composed of positive or negative runs a positive run shows a wet period while a negative run shows a dry period dry periods are identified from the spi time series droughts with different durations are counted from the dry periods at the same time using regression analysis an equation is established between precipitation and the spi time series the most severe drought among the droughts identified the critical drought was determined for each year frequency analysis is then applied to the critical drought severities of different durations critical drought severity is obtained for each return period with the back transformation of the probability distribution function fitted the critical precipitation that corresponds to the critical drought severity and the precipitation threshold that corresponds to spi 0 are calculated from the regression equation the difference between the precipitation threshold and the critical precipitation the precipitation deficit and its ratio to the drought duration the intensity deficit are calculated the precipitation deficit is calculated based on the most severe drought that could be observed for each year the sdf and idf curves of the critical droughts are finally plotted in terms of precipitation deficit after the procedure is repeated for all return periods drought durations and time scales fig 2 it should be noted that the sdf and idf curves use the precipitation deficit not the severity or the intensity of the drought 4 1 identification of dry periods and determination of critical droughts in order to identify dry periods the spi time series are first calculated at different time scales a dry period starts as soon as the spi gets a value lower than zero spi 0 while spi 0 in wet periods based on this conceptualization dry and wet periods are first identified the duration and severity of droughts are determined from the dry periods the critical drought severity of k time scale and d duration was then obtained for each year from the droughts determined within the identified dry periods the critical drought is selected independent of the month it was observed when selecting the critical drought severity in the year more clearly the critical drought might be observed in any month of the year when there exists only one drought within a year no matter how long and how severe it is assigned as the critical drought of this particular year another option is that no drought might be observed in some years for which then no critical drought exists 4 2 frequency analysis of critical droughts frequency analysis is applied on non zero drought severities only by taking the probability of zero values into account the total probability theorem is available for such a time series according to haan 1977 6 p x x p x x x 0 p x 0 p x x x 0 p x 0 where p x x is the cumulative probability that the variable x the drought severity in this study takes values equal to or greater than x the cumulative probability in eq 6 is composed of two conditional probabilities the first of which is 7 p x x x 0 0 therefore 8 p x x p x x x 0 p x 0 is obtained p x 0 is the rate of years with non zero values in the spik time series eq 8 can also be written in terms of the cumulative probability distribution as 9 1 f x 1 p 1 f x in eq 9 p is the probability of zero values f x is the cumulative probability distribution function of all x including zeros and f x is the cumulative probability distribution function of the non zero values of x the rate of the non zero values 1 p in eq 9 can be expressed in terms of the probability as 10 1 p p x 0 eq 9 can be used to predict the magnitude of a drought event with return period t by solving for f x and then using the inverse transformation of f x to get the value of x from eq 9 11 f x f x p 1 p can be written return period of a given severity for a particular drought duration can be predicted by 12 f x 1 1 t eq 11 turns then into 13 f x 1 1 t p 1 p when eq 12 is inserted into eq 11 as the probability changes by its definition between 0 and 1 that is a non negative value the application of the total probability theorem to the drought analysis depends on if the relation 14 p t 1 t is satisfied eq 14 means that the probability of observing a given severity for a given return period t and fraction p is zero when f x 0 frequency analysis is performed to characterize the drought and to determine the probability distribution function of critical drought severities the 2 and 3 parameter gamma g2 g3 the generalized extreme value gev the 2 and 3 parameter log normal ln2 ln3 log pearson type 3 lp3 and the 2 and 3 parameter weibull w2 w3 probability distribution functions were considered in this study frequency analysis was applied on the critical drought severity time series for each drought duration d 1 2 months up to the longest duration to find the best fit probability distribution function for all k 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month time scales years with no drought are subject to removal from the spi time series i e zero values were ignored when the probability distribution function is detected the non zero critical drought severity time series 10 years long at minimum were used no frequency analysis was applied for shorter cases drought severity is given in terms of a negative spi value while the probability distribution functions tested in this study are all given for non negative variables therefore the absolute values of the critical drought severities were taken the best fit probability distribution function was decided after the anderson darling statistical test 4 3 regression between precipitation and spi spi is calculated from precipitation therefore there is a clear relationship between precipitation and the corresponding spi values and it can be detected by regression analysis when the drought duration and return period increase it is expected that precipitation decreases and therefore precipitation deficit increases in drought any function to be used for the regression between precipitation and the corresponding spi should satisfy this expectation therefore some types of functions such as the second and third order polynomials were omitted as they might produce negative precipitation deficit values and could not fit properly to the spi time series of months with high number of zero values as a result the logistic function was seen appropriate to choose among the functions tested the simple logistic function has the form of 15 f x a 1 b e c x in which a b and c are parameters taken as the sum of spi over k months by definition the critical drought severity values of d month duration and t year return period for each k time scale were inserted into the regression equation to find the corresponding critical precipitation when precipitation total over k time scale in a particular month is lower than the calculated critical precipitation it is said that the d month duration t year return period drought is reached 4 4 precipitation threshold and precipitation deficit instead of the direct use of spi to develop sdf curves as did in previous studies dalezios et al 2001 in this study the concept of precipitation deficit is proposed the methodology proposed helps a better understanding as the accumulated precipitation is used instead of spi to define the drought event so that it can be easily identified by end users such as farmers and decision makers the critical precipitation the precipitation that corresponds to the critical drought severity values was calculated from the regression equation which relates precipitation with spi the regression equation is also used to calculate the precipitation threshold pth which is taken as precipitation at spi 0 for all time scales fig 3 in other words a drought begins when precipitation reaches the threshold value at spi 0 and becomes lower as time proceeds as a result the difference between the precipitation threshold pth and the critical precipitation pc which occurs at the critical drought severity 16 p d p th p c is defined as the precipitation deficit it is calculated for each month of the year in sub year time scales k 1 3 6 9 months due to the seasonality in the precipitation but it is calculated once at annual scale for time scales k 12 and 24 months boundary precipitations in fig 3 show the upper and lower boundaries in terms of precipitation for each drought classes as defined by mckee et al 1993 who proposed spi 0 1 1 5 2 as the upper boundaries of the mild moderate severe and extreme droughts respectively when calculating the precipitation deficit drought duration and return period are also considered as the critical drought changes at each case 4 5 sdf and idf curves of critical droughts the characterization of sdf of drought events is of great importance this is the novel part of this study aiming at developing the critical drought sdf idf curves in terms of precipitation deficit calculated by eq 16 in the drought management practice it is of great importance to determine and supply the amount of water required to overcome or minimize any damage and destructive effect that might be caused by the drought when a decision is to be made on the drought management spi based tools can only provide indirect technical information on precipitation which requires extra efforts to properly interpret the drought events however by using the precipitation deficit a direct non technical information comes out that can easily be interpreted without extra efforts as the precipitation deficit is physically better understandable and more tangible for the end users such as farmers and decision makers the methodology provides the end users the information needed for taking short medium and long term actions in the drought risk management irrigation planning and water resources development strategies information about how to predetermine the precipitation deficit is also possible to derive from the sdf idf curves developed in this study 5 study area and data adana meteorological station is located in seyhan river basin on the mediterranean region in southern turkey the meteorological station is situated at the latitude 37 0041 n and the longitude 35 3443 e its altitude is 23 m above the mean sea level the river basin has a climate strongly influenced by a mountainous steep and harsh topography in northern lowlands and in the southern parts fig 4 the basin extends from the mediterranean coast to the north and shows three different characteristics in terms of climate the northern part of the basin exhibits the characteristics of the central anatolian climate thus it is colder than the southern part of the basin the highest precipitation is observed at highlands in this part of the basin in the coastal areas and surrounding areas in the south the summer season is hot and dry while the winter is warm and rainy the central part of the basin between the coastal zone and the mountains has a semi arid mediterranean climate with dry and hot summers and rainy and warm winters monthly precipitation data of the meteorological station were obtained from the general directorate of meteorology of turkey the average annual total precipitation is 663 mm changing between 317 mm and 1265 mm in the 57 year observation period from 1960 to 2016 6 results and discussion 6 1 regression between precipitation and corresponding spi values a regression was established between precipitation total over k months and the corresponding spik values fig 5 clearly shows that the relation between precipitation and spik which comes from equation 1 changes from month to month for k 1 3 6 9 month time scales owing to the periodicity seasonality of precipitation monthly regression equations are therefore used in calculating precipitation deficit for spi1 spi3 spi6 and spi9 as far as the 12 and 24 month time scales are concerned the mean of k accumulated values of precipitation tend to get closer and they are almost equal while precipitation deficit increases in magnitude with increasing k the scattering becomes less variable monthly regression curves get closer with increasing time scale and finally they overlap when the time scale is a year or its multiple 6 2 determination of critical droughts in dry periods dry and wet periods as an example are given in fig 6 for the spi12 time series that is composed of subsequent wet and dry periods starting on december 1960 the critical drought severity for k 12 month time scale and the drought durations are given in table 1 for the period of 1960 2016 the one month drought was observed in 46 years within the observation period from 1960 to 2016 in adana meteorological station as expected with decreasing drought duration the drought severity reflected by the precipitation deficit decreases in other words the drought severity increases with increasing drought duration however the likelihood of the drought is reduced when the drought duration increases it is less probable to observe longer droughts in table 1 also it is seen that no negative spi is obtained in some years for longer droughts thus the severity of critical drought in such years is taken zero 6 3 frequency analysis of critical droughts results of frequency analysis for the spi12 in adana meteorological station are given in table 2 the generalized extreme value gev distribution was found the best to fit to the critical severities for majority of the drought durations although the ln3 g2 and lp3 distributions were found alternatively applicable in some cases this has been the case for other time scales as well by determining the parameter of the best fit probability distribution function the severity values corresponding to return periods of 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years were calculated with the back transformation of the best fit probability distribution function when the return period and the drought duration increase the drought severity is expected to increase owing to the physics of the drought process however in some cases but not many in number this is not satisfied because of the use of different types of the best fit probability distribution functions for different d duration droughts a minor modification was therefore applied such that a longer duration drought has always been more severe 6 4 critical drought sdf idf values critical severity of a d month duration drought corresponding to a given return period were determined by taking the back transformation of the best fit probability distribution function after the frequency analysis the drought sdf values for all time scales were obtained the critical drought severity and intensity values at k 12 month time scale are given in table 3 it is seen that the drought severity and intensity increase so does the return period however the former increases with increasing drought duration while the latter decreases the drought severity in the 2 year return period was not calculated for longer drought durations because long duration droughts were observed less frequent compared to the short duration droughts for short return periods 6 5 precipitation threshold and precipitation deficit the precipitation threshold calculated from the regression equations are shown in fig 7 according to which at k 1 month drought begins when precipitation falls below 84 mm in january similarly 75 mm in february 58 mm in march 45 mm in april etc are the threshold values at the same time scale in any case precipitation is lower than the monthly threshold it is said that a drought has started at the k time scale the precipitation threshold is obviously lower in summer than winter because of the seasonal character of precipitation in the study area the threshold values of the spi12 and spi24 are 644 mm and 1309 mm respectively which are higher than spik values for k 1 3 6 9 months the threshold values for the spi1 are the lowest in summer the lowest values of spik shift from summer to autumn with k moving from 3 to 9 months due to the accumulation of the low precipitation summer over the autumn season when calculating the spi precipitation deficit was calculated by eq 16 at all time scales return periods and drought durations precipitation deficits calculated for spi12 are given in table 4 it is seen that precipitation deficit increases with increasing drought duration and return period 6 6 critical drought sdf curves based on precipitation deficit the precipitation deficit curves for spi1 spi3 spi6 and spi9 were calculated at monthly scale there calculated also is the annual precipitation deficit for spi 12 and spi 24 results of spi1 spi6 and spi12 are presented and discussed together based on the precipitation deficit duration frequency curves given in figs 8 10 it is seen that precipitation deficit increases when the duration and return period of drought increase it is also seen that the 2 year return period precipitation deficit traces a curve far from the curves of 5 10 25 50 and 100 year return periods the longest drought duration is only 3 months for the 2 year return period whereas it is 5 months at other return periods for the 1 month time scale for the time scale k 6 months it is 5 months for the 2 year return period 10 months for the 5 year return period and 11 months for other return periods droughts of spi12 are 14 month long for all return periods except for the 2 year return period for which the drought duration is 6 months as expected the drought duration increases with increasing time scale in the practical sense a meteorological drought lasts shorter than an agricultural drought or a hydrological drought an increase is observed in the precipitation deficit as the time scale increases however the precipitation deficit rate decreases with increasing drought duration also the difference among precipitation deficit becomes gradually negligible with increase in the drought duration and the precipitation deficit curves approach each other this is a general result which is valid for all months in the year and more obvious in k 6 month time scale than the k 1 month time scale fig 8 this is applied to sdf curves at k 12 months as well since the potential deficit increases for larger k and the upper limits are fixed by the thresholds in fig 7 as far as the seasonality in precipitation is concerned as expected precipitation deficit decreases in summer and increases in winter potential precipitation in summer is smaller than in winter due to the fact that total precipitation average in summer is lower than in winter finally it should be emphasized that almost no difference exists practically among precipitation deficits for 25 year or longer return periods for long drought durations particularly it is possible also to extract that precipitation deficit increases for all drought durations as the return period increases however it is more obvious when drought duration becomes shorter table 4 6 7 intensity duration frequency idf curves and drought classes the drought severity increases as it is accumulated over the drought duration this gives an idea that longer droughts are always more severe than shorter ones however this is not a generalized result that is always applicable when the drought classification is concerned the intensity the average severity is therefore used in this study to classify a drought as opposed to the drought severity drought intensity decreases with increasing drought duration which should not give an idea that the longer the drought the better it should be emphasized that the drought intensity is used in this study to assign a drought class mild moderate severe extreme based on the average severity because for taking proper measures against the drought to overcome or minimize its negative effect on different sectors as well as ecology and the society it is important to know what precipitation deficit corresponds to what drought class the idf curves based on the intensity of precipitation deficit for spi1 spi6 and spi12 are given in figs 11 13 when the 2 year return period is excluded almost no difference exists among the average precipitation deficit for all return periods particularly in long drought durations with increase in drought duration the intensity decreases as expected this comes from the definition of intensity which is the severity divided by the drought duration however this should not give the idea that the longer the drought the better because the negative effect of the drought is measured by its severity not intensity on the other hand the drought intensity increases slightly with increasing return period although it converges to the same curve for return periods other than 2 years because the difference among the intensities for return periods 5 10 25 50 and 100 years becomes quickly negligible with increase in the drought duration this is applied to all time scales the likelihood of very severe droughts decreases with increasing drought duration thus droughts become milder when they persist this is a general result which is valid for all months in the year and more obvious in long drought durations also comparison of the intensity at k 1 and 6 months indicates an increase in the intensity as the time scale increases the intensity decreases in summer while it increases in winter due to the seasonality in the precipitation as far as the drought classes are concerned the upper boundaries of each drought class are seen in table 5 in terms of intensity they are 0 49 62 and 70 mm month in january as an example for mild moderate severe and extreme drought respectively at k 1 month time scale as an example a moderate drought is observed if the precipitation deficit is 59 mm month in january the precipitation deficits were similarly calculated for each month of the year at 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 year return periods comparison of the intensity of the d month duration and t year return period drought with the boundary intensities allows one to determine the class of the drought the precipitation deficit intensity of the d month duration and t year return period droughts at the time scale k 12 months are given in table 6 the precipitation deficit intensity is obtained for each of the drought duration at all return periods by dividing the severities in table 4 with the drought duration the observed droughts could be classified based on the boundary intensities given in table 5 for all time scales it is seen from the comparison of table 6 with the boundary values given for spi12 in table 5 that droughts become milder with increasing duration and decreasing return period longer return period and shorter duration droughts are the most severe with the use of idf curves it is expected that the destructive and irreversible effects of drought can be realized with physically measurable variables rather than the more technical drought indices such as the spi when using the spi information on the drought phenomenon is hidden it requires technical and analytical backgrounds to extract the final information in the form of physical variables such as precipitation as in this study with the use of precipitation a direct and physically meaningful information is provided to the end users who are familiar with monthly seasonal or annual precipitation after their experience in the field such direct information on precipitation deficit allows making advance planning and taking measures against drought thus the idf curves based on precipitation deficit are important tools to develop based on eq 5 the intensity is obtained by dividing the total severity over the drought duration for different return periods the boundaries of drought classes were also determined by inserting the boundary spi values fig 3 as given by mckee et al 1993 into the logistic function of the general form as in eq 15 obtained after regression analysis 7 conclusions sdf idf curves are developed based on the drought severity and intensity for this frequency analysis is applied on the critical drought severities by testing 2 and 3 parameter probability distribution functions critical severity values in dry periods include a significant number of zeros therefore zero values are excluded from the frequency analysis by using the total probability theorem which assigns a probability mass function to zeros and a probability distribution function to the non zero positive values the generalized extreme value probability distribution function is found the best fit distribution to the critical severities almost for all drought durations in adana meteorological station in seyhan river basin in southern turkey considering spik for time scales k 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 months the 2 parameter lognormal and log pearson type iii can also be chosen alternatively in some cases based on results of this study in order to make the analysis more physically based relationship between the precipitation and corresponding spi is examined by regression analysis in which the logistic function is found the most applicable to satisfy the physical characterization of the drought as a result drought sdf idf curves show that the 2 year return period droughts are rather different than drought at longer return periods it is also found that droughts with 25 years and longer return periods tend to become the same particularly for long drought durations the sdf idf curves are finally developed based on precipitation deficit to provide a comprehensive characterization of the drought the precipitation deficit is calculated from the spi which is a technical tool and thus difficult to be understood by end users and decision makers precipitation deficit is however more useful and meaningful and physically better understandable precipitation deficit allows one to make in advance planning and take measures against drought with the use of the proposed methodology based on precipitation deficit it is expected that the destructive and irreversible effects of the droughts can be realized in a more physical sense it provides the end users information needed for taking short medium and long term actions in the drought risk management irrigation planning and water resources development strategies also it is expected that the precipitation deficit to overcome a foreseen drought could be predetermined such that measures can be taken in advance against the destructive and irreversible effects of the drought newly established definitions such as critical drought critical drought severity singular drought boundary precipitation and within period drought introduced in the study and the novel methodology based on the precipitation deficit are expected to be beneficial for the future studies on drought the concepts and methodology are open to be extended to drought indices other than the spi declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

5682,drought is one of the most disastrous natural phenomena that causes scarcity and lack of water in hydrological basins and affects seriously the majority of the population in many ways such as economical social and environmental therefore drought plays a significant role in the risk management of water resources systems the purpose of this study is to develop the severity intensity duration frequency curves based on precipitation deficit and provide a comprehensive characterization of droughts by using standardized precipitation index spi which considers precipitation data only instead of using spi directly the severity and intensity were calculated in the duration frequency curves on the other hand spi is a technical tool and thus difficult to understand at first glance by end users and decision makers precipitation deficit is therefore more useful and physically meaningful to the users in this study drought with the largest severity in each year is defined as the critical drought of the year frequency analysis is applied on the critical drought severity to determine the best fit probability distribution function by using the total probability theorem results show that the 2 year return period drought severity intensity duration frequency curve is well lower than and separated clearly from the curves at higher return periods of 5 100 years although it has the same tendency with the longer return period curves and also that almost no difference is observed between the precipitation deficit of the droughts of 25 years or longer return periods with the precipitation deficit and such newly introduced concepts as critical drought severity singular drought and within period drought the proposed methodology gains a novelty it is expected that the destructive and irreversible effects of meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts can be realized in a more physical sense with the use of precipitation deficit keywords critical drought severity intensity severity intensity duration frequency curve singular drought standardized precipitation index within period drought 1 introduction according to the united nations convention to combat desertification in those countries experiencing serious drought and or desertification drought means the naturally occurring phenomenon that exists when precipitation has been significantly below normal recorded levels causing serious hydrological imbalances that adversely affect land resource production systems un 1994 drought has an impact on a large number of areas since water is the source of life and this makes it harder to point one certain definition for the drought geophysicists engineers economists agriculturists and all water users have their own conception of drought since they have different points of view and different conditions of operation yevjevich 1967 as wilhite and glantz 1985 stated it is neither possible nor beneficial to find a universal definition of drought but there are sub definitions which can be categorized according to the disciplinary perspective as meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic water scarcity becomes more effective with the presence of droughts riebsame et al 1991 bates et al 2008 yet drought is probably among the least understood hazards hagman 1984 because of its random and complex behavior this is why there still exists a great demand for research on drought in the scientific community mishra and singh 2011 indicators are used in drought analysis they are precipitation for meteorological drought soil moisture and crop yield for agricultural drought and streamflow reservoir level lake water level and groundwater level for hydrological drought mishra and singh 2010 using the indicators drought indices are quantified a quite high number of drought indices is available in the literature for the assessment of the drought a few commonly used drought indices are the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 crop moisture index cmi palmer 1968 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 soil moisture drought index smdi hollinger et al 1993 vegetation condition index vci liu and kogan 1996 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 among which spi has been the most common as it is suggested by the world meteorological organization wmo 2012 to the meteorological organizations of member states as a standard for drought characterization for a detailed discussion on drought indices see heim 2002 and mishra and singh 2010 also a review paper on drought characterization from a multivariate perspective and the development of different methods for multivariate drought indices is available hao and singh 2015 two basic parameters which are essential to characterize a drought are the duration and the severity the duration of a drought is the expression of how long the deficit of water continues while the severity refers to the degree of the deficit the ratio of the severity to the duration is called intensity another significant drought characteristic is the frequency or return period which is defined as the number of drought events in a given time period or indicated by the average time between the occurrence of subsequent drought events with a certain magnitude or less haan 1977 in the literature there have been limitless studies on the drought characterization among which dalezios et al 2001 tsakiris and vangelis 2005 nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 vicente serrano et al 2010 santos et al 2011 tigkas et al 2015 yacoub and tayfur 2017 can be mentioned on the other hand there has been significant number of research studies on the probabilistic characterization of droughts since yevjevich 1967 introduced the run theory as a drought is a probabilistic multivariate process sen 1976 loaiciga and leipnik 1996 chung and salas 2000 mishra and singh 2009 although frequency analysis is one of the most common and earliest applications in hydrology and it is therefore significant its sole use become insufficient for drought studies unless it is numerically related to other factors such as the severity duration and intensity rahmat et al 2015 dracup et al 1980 rossi et al 1992 loaiciga and leipnik 1996 mishra and singh 2011 zarch et al 2015 investigated the changes in drought characteristics on different arid regions with and without consideration of potential evapotranspiration an important tool in drought studies is the sdf curve that accommodates the interrelation between the severity duration and frequency of drought occurrence from which drought with a certain severity and return period can be determined dalezios et al 2001 rahmat et al 2015 except for the recent study by aksoy et al 2018a b limited to four hydrological basins drought sdf or intensity duration frequency idf curves have not been yet investigated in turkey drought has so far been analyzed mainly by spi instead turkes and tatli 2009 bacanli 2017 dabanli et al 2017 as a different approximation aksoy et al 2018b and cetin et al 2018 derived precipitation deficit from the sdf curves for the drought characterization by using frequency analysis while cavus and aksoy 2019 performed a spatial drought analysis for a river basin in southern turkey the objective of this study is to derive station based severity intensity duration frequency sdf idf curves to quantify the recurrence intervals of droughts based on precipitation deficit a concept newly introduced in this study the focus of the study in terms of the methodology is based on the total probability theorem applied on the critical drought severity by using spi the sdf idf curves are developed in terms of precipitation deficit a case study on monthly precipitation data from adana meteorological station in seyhan river basin in southern turkey was performed to present the results of the proposed methodology 2 standardized precipitation index a variety of indices for characterizing drought have been devised which are in general all data demanding with high computational cost precipitation dependent drought indices assume that either the change of other climatological and meteorological variables is insignificant or is a known function of precipitation change among them spi mckee et al 1993 is the simplest one needing monthly precipitation data only however it allows to use precipitation for different time scales which are commonly taken as k 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 months typically precipitation data do not have a normal probability distribution but this can be overcome by applying a transformation to the precipitation dataset in calculating the spi values the gamma probability distribution function is transformed into the standard normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance the spi is then basically obtained from the transformation of the gamma distributed precipitation into the standard normal variable given as 1 spi ij x ij μ j σ j where x ij is precipitation at month j of year i μ j is monthly mean precipitation at month j and σ j is standard deviation of precipitation at month j spi over short term periods up to k 3 months is appropriate for measuring short term impacts on soil moisture snowpack and streamflow of small rivers spi calculated over medium term periods k 3 12 months i e spi3 to spi12 is appropriate for measuring the impact on streamflow and reservoir storage spi for longer term periods k 12 24 months is the best for assessing long term processes such as groundwater recharge mckee et al 1993 spi1 and spi3 are generally assumed to represent meteorological drought while spi6 and spi9 are considerable for agricultural drought and longer time scales such as spi12 and spi24 are proposed for hydrological drought using the methodology of spi drought indices can be calculated for other hydrological variables such as streamflow groundwater reservoir and snowpack nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 bloomfield and marchant 2013 3 basic concepts and definitions a dry period begins immediately when the spi falls below zero droughts are determined from the dry periods and drought characteristics such as the duration severity intensity and return period are calculated the concepts used in this study are defined as follows a dry period length l the cluster which consists of consecutive negative values of spi refers to as the dry period fig 1 it begins in a month with a negative spi and continue until a positive spi value is obtained in the time series a dry period is shown as 2 a s p i s p i 0 where s a is the number of elements of set a that shows the length of the dry period as 3 l s a which is determined as a fixed value for each dry period b drought duration d duration of droughts in a dry period with length l is 0 d l fig 1 it should be emphasized that the dry period and drought are two similar but different concepts the former has a fixed length while the later has a changing duration in order to make the distinction between the dry period and the drought clear the new concepts introduced in this study the within period drought and singular drought are immediately defined c within period drought any drought with a duration shorter than the length of dry period is called within period drought for example in a dry period of 3 month long there are three 1 month droughts and two 2 month droughts similarly there are two 1 month droughts in a dry period of 2 month long d singular drought drought that extends over the dry period is called a singular drought for example there exists a 1 month singular drought in a dry period of 1 month long a 2 month singular drought in a dry period of 2 month long a 3 month singular drought in a dry period of 3 month long and so on the length of dry period becomes the same as the drought duration for singular droughts while the former is larger than the latter for within period droughts e drought severity s the accumulation of negative spi values preceded and followed by positive spi values is called severity if it is considered in terms of absolute values the severity of a drought d month long is calculated by 4 s i 1 d spi i spi i a in other words the severity is the largest absolute value of the cumulative drought index spi in this study for each drought duration f drought intensity i the intensity is obtained by dividing the severity to the drought duration as 5 i s d g critical drought severity when more than one drought is recorded for any year drought with maximum severity is taken as the critical drought no critical drought is assigned to a year in which drought is not observed h no drought year any year with no negative run of spi is considered a year with no drought thus the critical drought severity is not calculated for such a year a zero value is assigned to the critical drought severity an assumption has been made in this study such that only one drought is accounted per a year it is called critical drought which is the most severe in terms of its severity over the drought duration droughts are assigned to the months they end this is applied also to over year droughts that start in one year and end in another year for example a 3 month drought period from june to august both inclusive was assigned to august this is applied also to the over year droughts i e a drought that starts in march and ends in august next year is considered as an 18 month drought of august of the next year as expected no drought might be observed in some years for the selected drought duration which means the severity is zero the zero severity values were considered in the development of the drought sdf curve by using the total probability theorem applicable to intermittent censored time series haan 1977 here further definitions are required the first among them is the critical precipitation the precipitation that corresponds to the critical drought severity values similarly precipitation corresponding to spi 0 is called precipitation threshold the difference between the precipitation threshold and the critical precipitation the precipitation deficit and its ratio to the drought duration the intensity deficit are calculated 4 methodology methodology proposed in this study uses monthly precipitation data of a single meteorological station as the input and plots the sdf and idf curves of critical droughts as the final outputs fig 2 the spi is the start point of the methodology which is considered for time scales k 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 months the spi time series is composed of positive or negative runs a positive run shows a wet period while a negative run shows a dry period dry periods are identified from the spi time series droughts with different durations are counted from the dry periods at the same time using regression analysis an equation is established between precipitation and the spi time series the most severe drought among the droughts identified the critical drought was determined for each year frequency analysis is then applied to the critical drought severities of different durations critical drought severity is obtained for each return period with the back transformation of the probability distribution function fitted the critical precipitation that corresponds to the critical drought severity and the precipitation threshold that corresponds to spi 0 are calculated from the regression equation the difference between the precipitation threshold and the critical precipitation the precipitation deficit and its ratio to the drought duration the intensity deficit are calculated the precipitation deficit is calculated based on the most severe drought that could be observed for each year the sdf and idf curves of the critical droughts are finally plotted in terms of precipitation deficit after the procedure is repeated for all return periods drought durations and time scales fig 2 it should be noted that the sdf and idf curves use the precipitation deficit not the severity or the intensity of the drought 4 1 identification of dry periods and determination of critical droughts in order to identify dry periods the spi time series are first calculated at different time scales a dry period starts as soon as the spi gets a value lower than zero spi 0 while spi 0 in wet periods based on this conceptualization dry and wet periods are first identified the duration and severity of droughts are determined from the dry periods the critical drought severity of k time scale and d duration was then obtained for each year from the droughts determined within the identified dry periods the critical drought is selected independent of the month it was observed when selecting the critical drought severity in the year more clearly the critical drought might be observed in any month of the year when there exists only one drought within a year no matter how long and how severe it is assigned as the critical drought of this particular year another option is that no drought might be observed in some years for which then no critical drought exists 4 2 frequency analysis of critical droughts frequency analysis is applied on non zero drought severities only by taking the probability of zero values into account the total probability theorem is available for such a time series according to haan 1977 6 p x x p x x x 0 p x 0 p x x x 0 p x 0 where p x x is the cumulative probability that the variable x the drought severity in this study takes values equal to or greater than x the cumulative probability in eq 6 is composed of two conditional probabilities the first of which is 7 p x x x 0 0 therefore 8 p x x p x x x 0 p x 0 is obtained p x 0 is the rate of years with non zero values in the spik time series eq 8 can also be written in terms of the cumulative probability distribution as 9 1 f x 1 p 1 f x in eq 9 p is the probability of zero values f x is the cumulative probability distribution function of all x including zeros and f x is the cumulative probability distribution function of the non zero values of x the rate of the non zero values 1 p in eq 9 can be expressed in terms of the probability as 10 1 p p x 0 eq 9 can be used to predict the magnitude of a drought event with return period t by solving for f x and then using the inverse transformation of f x to get the value of x from eq 9 11 f x f x p 1 p can be written return period of a given severity for a particular drought duration can be predicted by 12 f x 1 1 t eq 11 turns then into 13 f x 1 1 t p 1 p when eq 12 is inserted into eq 11 as the probability changes by its definition between 0 and 1 that is a non negative value the application of the total probability theorem to the drought analysis depends on if the relation 14 p t 1 t is satisfied eq 14 means that the probability of observing a given severity for a given return period t and fraction p is zero when f x 0 frequency analysis is performed to characterize the drought and to determine the probability distribution function of critical drought severities the 2 and 3 parameter gamma g2 g3 the generalized extreme value gev the 2 and 3 parameter log normal ln2 ln3 log pearson type 3 lp3 and the 2 and 3 parameter weibull w2 w3 probability distribution functions were considered in this study frequency analysis was applied on the critical drought severity time series for each drought duration d 1 2 months up to the longest duration to find the best fit probability distribution function for all k 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month time scales years with no drought are subject to removal from the spi time series i e zero values were ignored when the probability distribution function is detected the non zero critical drought severity time series 10 years long at minimum were used no frequency analysis was applied for shorter cases drought severity is given in terms of a negative spi value while the probability distribution functions tested in this study are all given for non negative variables therefore the absolute values of the critical drought severities were taken the best fit probability distribution function was decided after the anderson darling statistical test 4 3 regression between precipitation and spi spi is calculated from precipitation therefore there is a clear relationship between precipitation and the corresponding spi values and it can be detected by regression analysis when the drought duration and return period increase it is expected that precipitation decreases and therefore precipitation deficit increases in drought any function to be used for the regression between precipitation and the corresponding spi should satisfy this expectation therefore some types of functions such as the second and third order polynomials were omitted as they might produce negative precipitation deficit values and could not fit properly to the spi time series of months with high number of zero values as a result the logistic function was seen appropriate to choose among the functions tested the simple logistic function has the form of 15 f x a 1 b e c x in which a b and c are parameters taken as the sum of spi over k months by definition the critical drought severity values of d month duration and t year return period for each k time scale were inserted into the regression equation to find the corresponding critical precipitation when precipitation total over k time scale in a particular month is lower than the calculated critical precipitation it is said that the d month duration t year return period drought is reached 4 4 precipitation threshold and precipitation deficit instead of the direct use of spi to develop sdf curves as did in previous studies dalezios et al 2001 in this study the concept of precipitation deficit is proposed the methodology proposed helps a better understanding as the accumulated precipitation is used instead of spi to define the drought event so that it can be easily identified by end users such as farmers and decision makers the critical precipitation the precipitation that corresponds to the critical drought severity values was calculated from the regression equation which relates precipitation with spi the regression equation is also used to calculate the precipitation threshold pth which is taken as precipitation at spi 0 for all time scales fig 3 in other words a drought begins when precipitation reaches the threshold value at spi 0 and becomes lower as time proceeds as a result the difference between the precipitation threshold pth and the critical precipitation pc which occurs at the critical drought severity 16 p d p th p c is defined as the precipitation deficit it is calculated for each month of the year in sub year time scales k 1 3 6 9 months due to the seasonality in the precipitation but it is calculated once at annual scale for time scales k 12 and 24 months boundary precipitations in fig 3 show the upper and lower boundaries in terms of precipitation for each drought classes as defined by mckee et al 1993 who proposed spi 0 1 1 5 2 as the upper boundaries of the mild moderate severe and extreme droughts respectively when calculating the precipitation deficit drought duration and return period are also considered as the critical drought changes at each case 4 5 sdf and idf curves of critical droughts the characterization of sdf of drought events is of great importance this is the novel part of this study aiming at developing the critical drought sdf idf curves in terms of precipitation deficit calculated by eq 16 in the drought management practice it is of great importance to determine and supply the amount of water required to overcome or minimize any damage and destructive effect that might be caused by the drought when a decision is to be made on the drought management spi based tools can only provide indirect technical information on precipitation which requires extra efforts to properly interpret the drought events however by using the precipitation deficit a direct non technical information comes out that can easily be interpreted without extra efforts as the precipitation deficit is physically better understandable and more tangible for the end users such as farmers and decision makers the methodology provides the end users the information needed for taking short medium and long term actions in the drought risk management irrigation planning and water resources development strategies information about how to predetermine the precipitation deficit is also possible to derive from the sdf idf curves developed in this study 5 study area and data adana meteorological station is located in seyhan river basin on the mediterranean region in southern turkey the meteorological station is situated at the latitude 37 0041 n and the longitude 35 3443 e its altitude is 23 m above the mean sea level the river basin has a climate strongly influenced by a mountainous steep and harsh topography in northern lowlands and in the southern parts fig 4 the basin extends from the mediterranean coast to the north and shows three different characteristics in terms of climate the northern part of the basin exhibits the characteristics of the central anatolian climate thus it is colder than the southern part of the basin the highest precipitation is observed at highlands in this part of the basin in the coastal areas and surrounding areas in the south the summer season is hot and dry while the winter is warm and rainy the central part of the basin between the coastal zone and the mountains has a semi arid mediterranean climate with dry and hot summers and rainy and warm winters monthly precipitation data of the meteorological station were obtained from the general directorate of meteorology of turkey the average annual total precipitation is 663 mm changing between 317 mm and 1265 mm in the 57 year observation period from 1960 to 2016 6 results and discussion 6 1 regression between precipitation and corresponding spi values a regression was established between precipitation total over k months and the corresponding spik values fig 5 clearly shows that the relation between precipitation and spik which comes from equation 1 changes from month to month for k 1 3 6 9 month time scales owing to the periodicity seasonality of precipitation monthly regression equations are therefore used in calculating precipitation deficit for spi1 spi3 spi6 and spi9 as far as the 12 and 24 month time scales are concerned the mean of k accumulated values of precipitation tend to get closer and they are almost equal while precipitation deficit increases in magnitude with increasing k the scattering becomes less variable monthly regression curves get closer with increasing time scale and finally they overlap when the time scale is a year or its multiple 6 2 determination of critical droughts in dry periods dry and wet periods as an example are given in fig 6 for the spi12 time series that is composed of subsequent wet and dry periods starting on december 1960 the critical drought severity for k 12 month time scale and the drought durations are given in table 1 for the period of 1960 2016 the one month drought was observed in 46 years within the observation period from 1960 to 2016 in adana meteorological station as expected with decreasing drought duration the drought severity reflected by the precipitation deficit decreases in other words the drought severity increases with increasing drought duration however the likelihood of the drought is reduced when the drought duration increases it is less probable to observe longer droughts in table 1 also it is seen that no negative spi is obtained in some years for longer droughts thus the severity of critical drought in such years is taken zero 6 3 frequency analysis of critical droughts results of frequency analysis for the spi12 in adana meteorological station are given in table 2 the generalized extreme value gev distribution was found the best to fit to the critical severities for majority of the drought durations although the ln3 g2 and lp3 distributions were found alternatively applicable in some cases this has been the case for other time scales as well by determining the parameter of the best fit probability distribution function the severity values corresponding to return periods of 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years were calculated with the back transformation of the best fit probability distribution function when the return period and the drought duration increase the drought severity is expected to increase owing to the physics of the drought process however in some cases but not many in number this is not satisfied because of the use of different types of the best fit probability distribution functions for different d duration droughts a minor modification was therefore applied such that a longer duration drought has always been more severe 6 4 critical drought sdf idf values critical severity of a d month duration drought corresponding to a given return period were determined by taking the back transformation of the best fit probability distribution function after the frequency analysis the drought sdf values for all time scales were obtained the critical drought severity and intensity values at k 12 month time scale are given in table 3 it is seen that the drought severity and intensity increase so does the return period however the former increases with increasing drought duration while the latter decreases the drought severity in the 2 year return period was not calculated for longer drought durations because long duration droughts were observed less frequent compared to the short duration droughts for short return periods 6 5 precipitation threshold and precipitation deficit the precipitation threshold calculated from the regression equations are shown in fig 7 according to which at k 1 month drought begins when precipitation falls below 84 mm in january similarly 75 mm in february 58 mm in march 45 mm in april etc are the threshold values at the same time scale in any case precipitation is lower than the monthly threshold it is said that a drought has started at the k time scale the precipitation threshold is obviously lower in summer than winter because of the seasonal character of precipitation in the study area the threshold values of the spi12 and spi24 are 644 mm and 1309 mm respectively which are higher than spik values for k 1 3 6 9 months the threshold values for the spi1 are the lowest in summer the lowest values of spik shift from summer to autumn with k moving from 3 to 9 months due to the accumulation of the low precipitation summer over the autumn season when calculating the spi precipitation deficit was calculated by eq 16 at all time scales return periods and drought durations precipitation deficits calculated for spi12 are given in table 4 it is seen that precipitation deficit increases with increasing drought duration and return period 6 6 critical drought sdf curves based on precipitation deficit the precipitation deficit curves for spi1 spi3 spi6 and spi9 were calculated at monthly scale there calculated also is the annual precipitation deficit for spi 12 and spi 24 results of spi1 spi6 and spi12 are presented and discussed together based on the precipitation deficit duration frequency curves given in figs 8 10 it is seen that precipitation deficit increases when the duration and return period of drought increase it is also seen that the 2 year return period precipitation deficit traces a curve far from the curves of 5 10 25 50 and 100 year return periods the longest drought duration is only 3 months for the 2 year return period whereas it is 5 months at other return periods for the 1 month time scale for the time scale k 6 months it is 5 months for the 2 year return period 10 months for the 5 year return period and 11 months for other return periods droughts of spi12 are 14 month long for all return periods except for the 2 year return period for which the drought duration is 6 months as expected the drought duration increases with increasing time scale in the practical sense a meteorological drought lasts shorter than an agricultural drought or a hydrological drought an increase is observed in the precipitation deficit as the time scale increases however the precipitation deficit rate decreases with increasing drought duration also the difference among precipitation deficit becomes gradually negligible with increase in the drought duration and the precipitation deficit curves approach each other this is a general result which is valid for all months in the year and more obvious in k 6 month time scale than the k 1 month time scale fig 8 this is applied to sdf curves at k 12 months as well since the potential deficit increases for larger k and the upper limits are fixed by the thresholds in fig 7 as far as the seasonality in precipitation is concerned as expected precipitation deficit decreases in summer and increases in winter potential precipitation in summer is smaller than in winter due to the fact that total precipitation average in summer is lower than in winter finally it should be emphasized that almost no difference exists practically among precipitation deficits for 25 year or longer return periods for long drought durations particularly it is possible also to extract that precipitation deficit increases for all drought durations as the return period increases however it is more obvious when drought duration becomes shorter table 4 6 7 intensity duration frequency idf curves and drought classes the drought severity increases as it is accumulated over the drought duration this gives an idea that longer droughts are always more severe than shorter ones however this is not a generalized result that is always applicable when the drought classification is concerned the intensity the average severity is therefore used in this study to classify a drought as opposed to the drought severity drought intensity decreases with increasing drought duration which should not give an idea that the longer the drought the better it should be emphasized that the drought intensity is used in this study to assign a drought class mild moderate severe extreme based on the average severity because for taking proper measures against the drought to overcome or minimize its negative effect on different sectors as well as ecology and the society it is important to know what precipitation deficit corresponds to what drought class the idf curves based on the intensity of precipitation deficit for spi1 spi6 and spi12 are given in figs 11 13 when the 2 year return period is excluded almost no difference exists among the average precipitation deficit for all return periods particularly in long drought durations with increase in drought duration the intensity decreases as expected this comes from the definition of intensity which is the severity divided by the drought duration however this should not give the idea that the longer the drought the better because the negative effect of the drought is measured by its severity not intensity on the other hand the drought intensity increases slightly with increasing return period although it converges to the same curve for return periods other than 2 years because the difference among the intensities for return periods 5 10 25 50 and 100 years becomes quickly negligible with increase in the drought duration this is applied to all time scales the likelihood of very severe droughts decreases with increasing drought duration thus droughts become milder when they persist this is a general result which is valid for all months in the year and more obvious in long drought durations also comparison of the intensity at k 1 and 6 months indicates an increase in the intensity as the time scale increases the intensity decreases in summer while it increases in winter due to the seasonality in the precipitation as far as the drought classes are concerned the upper boundaries of each drought class are seen in table 5 in terms of intensity they are 0 49 62 and 70 mm month in january as an example for mild moderate severe and extreme drought respectively at k 1 month time scale as an example a moderate drought is observed if the precipitation deficit is 59 mm month in january the precipitation deficits were similarly calculated for each month of the year at 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 year return periods comparison of the intensity of the d month duration and t year return period drought with the boundary intensities allows one to determine the class of the drought the precipitation deficit intensity of the d month duration and t year return period droughts at the time scale k 12 months are given in table 6 the precipitation deficit intensity is obtained for each of the drought duration at all return periods by dividing the severities in table 4 with the drought duration the observed droughts could be classified based on the boundary intensities given in table 5 for all time scales it is seen from the comparison of table 6 with the boundary values given for spi12 in table 5 that droughts become milder with increasing duration and decreasing return period longer return period and shorter duration droughts are the most severe with the use of idf curves it is expected that the destructive and irreversible effects of drought can be realized with physically measurable variables rather than the more technical drought indices such as the spi when using the spi information on the drought phenomenon is hidden it requires technical and analytical backgrounds to extract the final information in the form of physical variables such as precipitation as in this study with the use of precipitation a direct and physically meaningful information is provided to the end users who are familiar with monthly seasonal or annual precipitation after their experience in the field such direct information on precipitation deficit allows making advance planning and taking measures against drought thus the idf curves based on precipitation deficit are important tools to develop based on eq 5 the intensity is obtained by dividing the total severity over the drought duration for different return periods the boundaries of drought classes were also determined by inserting the boundary spi values fig 3 as given by mckee et al 1993 into the logistic function of the general form as in eq 15 obtained after regression analysis 7 conclusions sdf idf curves are developed based on the drought severity and intensity for this frequency analysis is applied on the critical drought severities by testing 2 and 3 parameter probability distribution functions critical severity values in dry periods include a significant number of zeros therefore zero values are excluded from the frequency analysis by using the total probability theorem which assigns a probability mass function to zeros and a probability distribution function to the non zero positive values the generalized extreme value probability distribution function is found the best fit distribution to the critical severities almost for all drought durations in adana meteorological station in seyhan river basin in southern turkey considering spik for time scales k 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 months the 2 parameter lognormal and log pearson type iii can also be chosen alternatively in some cases based on results of this study in order to make the analysis more physically based relationship between the precipitation and corresponding spi is examined by regression analysis in which the logistic function is found the most applicable to satisfy the physical characterization of the drought as a result drought sdf idf curves show that the 2 year return period droughts are rather different than drought at longer return periods it is also found that droughts with 25 years and longer return periods tend to become the same particularly for long drought durations the sdf idf curves are finally developed based on precipitation deficit to provide a comprehensive characterization of the drought the precipitation deficit is calculated from the spi which is a technical tool and thus difficult to be understood by end users and decision makers precipitation deficit is however more useful and meaningful and physically better understandable precipitation deficit allows one to make in advance planning and take measures against drought with the use of the proposed methodology based on precipitation deficit it is expected that the destructive and irreversible effects of the droughts can be realized in a more physical sense it provides the end users information needed for taking short medium and long term actions in the drought risk management irrigation planning and water resources development strategies also it is expected that the precipitation deficit to overcome a foreseen drought could be predetermined such that measures can be taken in advance against the destructive and irreversible effects of the drought newly established definitions such as critical drought critical drought severity singular drought boundary precipitation and within period drought introduced in the study and the novel methodology based on the precipitation deficit are expected to be beneficial for the future studies on drought the concepts and methodology are open to be extended to drought indices other than the spi declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

5683,there is growing empirical evidence that many river basins across the u s midwest have been experiencing an increase in the frequency of flood events over the most recent decades albeit these detected changes are important to understand what happened in our recent past they cannot be directly extrapolated to obtain information about possible future changes in the frequency of flood events building on recent statistically based attribution studies we project seasonal changes in the frequency of flood events at 286 u s geological survey gauging stations across the u s midwest using projections of precipitation antecedent wetness conditions and temperature as drivers the projections of the covariates are obtained from two datasets obtained by downscaling global circulation models from the fifth coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 we focus on the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 and on four different flood thresholds i e from more common to less frequent flood events we find that the frequency of flood events during the 21st century increases during spring at most of the analyzed gauging stations with larger changes in the northern great plains and regardless of the flood threshold value our findings also point to a projected increasing number of flood events during the winter especially in the stations in the southern and western part of the

their applicability loses strength and reliability for the analyses at the catchment scale gudmundsson et al 2012 and it represents a limitation when specific and localized flood mitigation plans are needed focusing on the u s midwest there are different studies analyzing the future characteristics of floods at specific catchments but they either consider a single catchment ahiablame et al 2017

events at the catchment scale compared to the physically based hydrological models because these models are faster to implement less time consuming and less affected by model parameters uncertainties duethmann et al 2015 here we adopt a statistical framework similar to the one described in neri et al 2019a 2019b by using poisson regression to attribute changes in the frequency of flood events i e the predictand to changes in precipitation temperature and antecedent wetness conditions i e the predictors at the seasonal scale we then use centennial precipitation and temperature projections from two different ensembles of downscaled and bias corrected gcms as input to these statistical models to investigate the projected changes in the frequency of flood events the research questions we want to answer are how is the frequency of flood events projected to change across the u s midwest during the 21st century are the changes uniform over the region and across seasons or are there hotspots that exhibit a stronger signal of change are the changes sensitive to the threshold values used to identify the events 2 data we focus on 286 usgs gauging stations located across the u s midwest the area includes illinois indiana iowa kansas michigan minnesota missouri nebraska north dakota ohio south dakota and wisconsin fig 1 the streamflow time series of each station has at least 50 consecutive complete years we consider a year complete if it has more than 330 daily observations of data and is not affected by any regulation i e not classified with code 5 or 6 according to the usgs notation we create the time series of the frequency of flood events using a peak over threshold pot approach counting the number of events with a discharge value greater than a selected threshold during each season winter december february spring march may summer june august fall september november of every year the flood threshold value is site specific and selected to give 1 2 3 or 4 events per year on average see also neri et al 2019b mallakpour and villarini 2015 for instance if at a given site we focus on two events per year on average over the 1940 2016 period i e 77 years we set a threshold so that we select the top 144 events making sure that each event is separate by 5 days plus the logarithm of the drainage area in square miles lang et al 1999 this threshold varies from site to site and decreases as we move from 1 to 4 events per year on average the time series obtained using these thresholds represent the predictand for our statistical models it is worth mentioning that the daily values are smaller than the instantaneous peak values especially at small basins however given that we work with events exceeding a threshold as long as the ratio between daily averages and instantaneous peaks is constant for a given basin the selected flood events would be the same observed precipitation and temperature records are derived from the prism dataset prism 2017 which provides monthly values across the entire united states at a resolution of 4 km for each gauging station we compute the basin averaged value of both variables for each month and then we aggregate it at the seasonal time scale to obtain the basin averaged seasonal precipitation and temperature time series we focus on the period starting from 1940 to 2016 centennial projections of precipitation and temperature are derived from two different datasets the north america coordinated regional downscaling experiment na cordex mearns et al 2017 and the localized constructed analogs loca pierce et al 2014 na cordex provides outputs of regional climate models rcms using boundary conditions from gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project phase five cmip5 taylor et al 2012 archive covering most of north america at a resolution of 0 22 and monthly the loca dataset provides daily time series of climate variables across north america at a resolution of 1 16th of a degree obtained by means of statistically downscaling the cmip5 gcms here we focus on the historical simulations of precipitation and temperature covering the 1950 2005 period and the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 for the projections from 2006 to 2100 we consider ten members of the na cordex obtained by using five gcms providing initial and boundary conditions to five rcms not all the rcms are used for each gcm loca has 32 members obtained by downscaling 32 gcms similar to the observations we use the gcm outputs to compute the basin averaged time series of seasonal precipitation and temperature the third predictor i e the antecedent wetness conditions is defined as the accumulated precipitation during the three months prior to the analyzed season e g kam and sheffield 2016 neri et al 2019a 2019b slater and villarini 2017 we then estimate the ensemble mean for each basin averaged driver with each gcm member having the same weight to correct for the biases in the ensemble mean of the loca and na cordex we use the delta change bias correction approach maraun 2016 with a modification that adjusts the variability of the historical and projected time series according to the observations the correction of the mean is simply accomplished by shifting the time series by the difference between the average of the simulated and observed variable over 1950 2005 i e the historical period the correction of the variance is performed in two steps first we compute the difference between the shifted time series and a moving average which allows us to estimate the variability of the time series locally then we multiply this difference by a factor which is estimated in such a way that the standard deviation of the gcm outputs over the historical period matches the one from the observation over the same period fig 2 shows an example usgs station 07014500 meramec river near sullivan missouri of the type of time series we create for each site and for precipitation and temperature based on observations and bias corrected gcm outputs 3 methodology our methodology builds on the approach described by neri et al 2019b and here we provide just a brief overview neri et al 2019b used poisson regression to relate the occurrence of flood events to six different predictors precipitation antecedent wetness conditions temperature population density as a proxy for urbanization and agricultural intensity i e combined harvested corn and soybean acreage they found that precipitation x p wetness conditions x m and temperature x t are the most important drivers across the study region and this is why we only consider these predictors in this study we combine these three variables to build four different statistical models relating the parameter of the poisson distribution to these covariates as described in table 1 model p only considers precipitation x p as covariate model p t considers precipitation x p and temperature x t model p m considers precipitation x p and wetness conditions x m model mixed considers all the three drivers in this last model which is not used for the winter season the value of temperature changes according to the analyzed season during spring the temperature is the average temperature for march and april x t mar a p r as a simple way to account for the generation of flood peaks caused by snowmelt and or rain on snow processes during summer and fall it considers the average temperature over the summer months as a proxy for the effects of evapotranspiration during summer and drying soils during fall similar to neri et al 2019a we fit the four models over the observational period from 1940 to 2016 pending data availability to each station season and flood threshold value and perform the model selection using the bayesian information criterion schwarz 1978 we estimate the α β γ and δ parameters table 1 for each of the best models over the 1940 2005 period and we evaluate their skill in reproducing the observed time series by computing the correlation coefficient between the observed and simulated flood count time series we then use the na cordex loca outputs as inputs to these poisson regression models to describe the projected changes in flood counts in a similar way as neri et al 2019a used decadal predictions as input to the models to investigate the future conditions of the frequency of flood events with a lead time up to ten years to quantify the temporal changes in the frequency of flood events during the historical and projection period we use poisson regression with time as predictor and focus on the sign and significance i e 5 and 10 level of the slope coefficient we show these values only if the time series has at least five years of non zero flood counts furthermore we compute the difference between the average number of flood events during three consecutive periods of the 21st century i e 2005 2035 2036 2069 2070 2099 and the historical period i e 1976 2005 to quantify the magnitude of these changes 4 results and discussion in this section we focus on the results based on a threshold that gives two event per year on average because the results for the other threshold values are similar see supplemental material fig 3 shows the best models that were selected at every gauging station and the corresponding correlation coefficient between observed and predicted flood counts time series for each season and for a flood threshold value that gives two peaks per year on average the same results for all the flood threshold values are shown in figures s1 and s2 of the supplemental material the p and p m models are selected at most of the stations suggesting that precipitation and antecedent wetness conditions are the two most important drivers of the frequency of flood events the mixed model is selected only in the northern stations during spring where temperature and antecedent wetness conditions are crucial for snow related flood generating processes lastly the p t model is the best model only in few stations with no significant consistency in space or season these results are consistent with previous similar analyses neri et al 2019a 2019b slater and villarini 2016 2017 which show that the frequency of flood events during spring at stations in the northern great plains is driven by a combination of temperature and antecedent wetness conditions and that precipitation is an important driver particularly during summer because across much of the study area the only drivers responsible for the frequency of flood events are precipitation and antecedent wetness conditions it is clear that changes in this flood hazard during the 21st century are mostly driven by projected changes in precipitation rather than temperature the skill of the poisson regression statistical models in reproducing the observed flood counts is overall good with an average correlation coefficient among the different seasons of 0 56 fig 3 consult neri et al 2019b for a more detailed evaluation of the model performance the trends of the seasonal frequency of flood events during the historical period for the flood threshold value that gives two peaks per year on average and according to the observations and to the median of the poisson regression model when using observations loca and na cordex datasets are shown in fig 4 figure s3 of the supplemental material shows the same results also for the other threshold values in general the poisson regression models using the observed precipitation and temperature as predictors are able to well reproduce the trends in the observed number of flood events compare the first and second columns of fig 4 these trends in the frequency of flood events are consistent with those obtained in mallakpour and villarini 2015 and neri et al 2019b with respect to a comparable historical period moreover these findings further support what mentioned in the introduction i e that it is the frequency of flood events rather than its magnitude villarini et al 2011 mallakpour and villarini 2015 which presents significant trends the statistical models forced with the na cordex well reproduce the observed positive and negative trends during all seasons except for winter where many trends in central indiana northern illinois and southern michigan are different the loca dataset also performs comparatively well even though it presents some trends which are discordant with the observations the two datasets behave similarly with respect to the spring season where most of the gauging stations present positive trends in agreement with the observations these findings are similar also for the trends obtained using a flood threshold value that gives 3 and 4 peaks per year on average figure s3 of the supplemental material the acceptable skill of the statistical models in reproducing the observed frequency of flood events when forced with climate observations and the ensemble of the historical runs by the gcms enables us to use the same models to project future changes in the frequency of flood events up to the end of the 21st century fig 5 shows the trends in the frequency of flood events over the 2006 2100 period based on the loca and na cordex dataset these results suggest that flood events are projected to become more frequent during the 21st century across much of the u s midwest during winter and spring the fall season presents instead spatially consistent negative trends with respect to the summer season no reliable conclusions can be drawn because the two datasets provide discordant results to quantify the magnitude of these changes fig 6 shows the difference between the average flood counts during three different future periods i e 2006 2035 2036 2069 and 2070 2099 compared to the last 30 years of the historical period 1976 2005 according to the loca and na cordex ensemble at a very general level we project a considerable increase in the frequency of flood events during winter and spring with larger changes as we move towards the end of the 21st century in particular the largest increases in the frequency of flood events occur in the stations located in the northern great plains during spring suggesting that projected precipitation during the wintertime and temperature play an important role in driving the future changes of the frequency of flood events in the context of snowmelt and potential changes in the seasonality of precipitation the winter season is subject to a considerable increase in flood events especially at stations located in the south eastern part of the domain that experience flooding associated with atmospheric rivers and extratropical cyclones e g lavers and villarini 2013 nakamura et al 2013 nayak and villarini 2017 with regards to summer and fall the results obtained using loca and na cordex fig 6 suggest that there is not a strong change at least compared to spring in terms of flood counts during the 21st century these last findings appear to be in contrast with many studies showing that precipitation is projected to slightly decrease during summer and fall in the u s midwest i e byun and hamlet 2018 swain and hayhoe 2015 which should lead to a reduction in the number of flood events one way to reconcile these discrepancies is by considering that the projected decrease in precipitation is small during these seasons see also winkler et al 2012 therefore at the stations where the model with precipitation as the only predictor is selected there are minor or no changes in the frequency of flood events leading to a muted response moreover some of the positive trends can be due to the possible increase in precipitation towards the end of the 21stcentury which leads to an increase in thefrequency of these events becausethose are the years that exert a significant leverage in terms of detected trends it is worth pointing out that these results are based on the assumption that the regression coefficients of the drivers of the best models estimated on the 1940 2005 period are the same also for the 2006 2100 projection period to gain insights with respect to the validity of this assumption we use a splitting sample validation approach we calibrate the statistical models on the 1940 1977 period and then we estimate the median of the poisson distribution on the 1978 2016 period i e the validation period figure s7 of the supplemental material shows the correlation coefficient between the observed and modeled flood counts over the validation period the models present good skill in reproducing the interannual variability of flood counts suggesting that the parameters of the best drivers obtained during the calibration period are also representative of the rainfall runoff processes of the following period even though this test provides encouraging results regarding the reliability and performance of our statistical models over the observational period it does not ensure the same robustness with respect to the projection period because we do not know how the future hydrological system is going to behave the uncertainties associated with the above mentioned assumption represent therefore a limitation of our approach which is however an attribute of information and therefore does not mean lack of knowledge blöschl and montanari 2010 we took these uncertainties into consideration in our results given that we developed probabilistic models rather than deterministic outputs 5 conclusions in this study we used a statistical approach to investigate the projected changes in the seasonal frequency of flood events during the 21st century at 286 usgs station across the u s midwest the results are based on downscaled and bias corrected gcm outputs and the rcp 8 5 the selection of the flood events is carried out through a peak over threshold approach and considering four different flood threshold values compared to previous studies here we provide a regional perspective of the projected changes in the frequency of flood events the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows the trends over the historical period 1950 2005 based on the na cordex reproduce reasonably well those from the observations especially during spring the loca dataset also performs well with the exception of the summer season where most of the trends have opposite signs with respect to the observations our findings suggest that the spring season is projected to experience a substantial increase in the frequency of flood events during the 21st century across much of the study region and in particular across the northern great plains the average number of flood events is also projected to increase in the winter especially in the south eastern part of the domain which is within the storm track of the extratropical cyclones despite summer and fall present statistically significant trends the change of the average number of flood counts is negligible for most of the gauging stations it is worth reminding that these results are based on the extrapolation of the modeling results for the historical period to the future this means that we assumed that the relationship between the response variable and the predictor s is expected to remain constant moreover we also assumed that the performance of the gcms for the historical period is a reflection of their performance in the future this framework provides a simple and rapid methodology to assess projected changes in flood events which can be further updated and improved

5683,there is growing empirical evidence that many river basins across the u s midwest have been experiencing an increase in the frequency of flood events over the most recent decades albeit these detected changes are important to understand what happened in our recent past they cannot be directly extrapolated to obtain information about possible future changes in the frequency of flood events building on recent statistically based attribution studies we project seasonal changes in the frequency of flood events at 286 u s geological survey gauging stations across the u s midwest using projections of precipitation antecedent wetness conditions and temperature as drivers the projections of the covariates are obtained from two datasets obtained by downscaling global circulation models from the fifth coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 we focus on the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 and on four different flood thresholds i e from more common to less frequent flood events we find that the frequency of flood events during the 21st century increases during spring at most of the analyzed gauging stations with larger changes in the northern great plains and regardless of the flood threshold value our findings also point to a projected increasing number of flood events during the winter especially in the stations in the southern and western part of the domain iowa missouri illinois ohio indiana and michigan a marked change in the frequency of flood events is not projected for the summer and fall keywords frequency of flood events projections statistical modeling cordex loca cmip5 1 introduction the hydrologic impacts of climate change have been the topic of a growing body of research and have attracted significant interest from decision

most of north america at a resolution of 0 22 and monthly the loca dataset provides daily time series of climate variables across north america at a resolution of 1 16th of a degree obtained by means of statistically downscaling the cmip5 gcms here we focus on the historical simulations of precipitation and temperature covering the 1950 2005 period and the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 for the projections from 2006 to 2100 we consider ten members of the na cordex obtained by using five gcms providing initial and boundary conditions to five rcms not all the rcms are used for each gcm loca has 32 members obtained by downscaling 32 gcms similar to the observations we use the gcm outputs to compute the basin averaged time series of seasonal precipitation and temperature the third predictor i e the antecedent wetness conditions is defined as the accumulated precipitation during the three months prior to the analyzed season e g kam and sheffield 2016 neri et al 2019a 2019b slater and villarini 2017 we then estimate the ensemble mean for each basin averaged driver with each gcm member having the same weight to correct for the biases in the ensemble mean of the loca and na cordex we use the delta change bias correction approach maraun 2016 with a modification that adjusts the variability of the historical and projected time series according to the observations the correction of the mean is simply accomplished by shifting the time series by the difference between the average of the simulated and observed variable over 1950 2005 i e the historical period the correction of the variance is performed in two steps first we compute the difference between the shifted time series and a moving average which allows us to estimate the variability of the time series locally then we multiply this difference by a factor which is estimated in such a way that the standard deviation of the gcm outputs over the historical period matches the one from the observation over the same period fig 2 shows an example usgs station 07014500 meramec river near sullivan missouri of the type of time series we create for each site and for precipitation and temperature based on observations and bias corrected gcm outputs 3 methodology our methodology builds on the approach described by neri et al 2019b and here we provide just a brief overview neri et al 2019b used poisson regression to relate the occurrence of flood events to six different predictors precipitation antecedent wetness conditions temperature population density as a proxy for urbanization and agricultural intensity i e combined harvested corn and soybean acreage they found that precipitation x p wetness conditions x m and temperature x t are the most important drivers across the study region and this is why we only consider these predictors in this study we combine these three variables to build four different statistical models relating the parameter of the poisson distribution to these covariates as described in table 1 model p only considers precipitation x p as covariate model p t considers precipitation x p and temperature x t model p m considers precipitation x p and wetness conditions x m model mixed considers all the three drivers in this last model which is not used for the winter season the value of temperature changes according to the analyzed season during spring the temperature is the average temperature for march and april x t mar a p r as a simple way to account for the generation of flood peaks caused by snowmelt and or rain on snow processes during summer and fall it considers the average temperature over the summer months as a proxy for the effects of evapotranspiration during summer and drying soils during fall similar to neri et al 2019a we fit the four models over the observational period from 1940 to 2016 pending data availability to each station season and flood threshold value and perform the model selection using the bayesian information criterion schwarz 1978 we estimate the α β γ and δ parameters table 1 for each of the best models over the 1940 2005 period and we evaluate their skill in reproducing the observed time series by computing the correlation coefficient between the observed and simulated flood count time series we then use the na cordex loca outputs as inputs to these poisson regression models to describe the projected changes in flood counts in a similar way as neri et al 2019a used decadal predictions as input to the models to investigate the future conditions of the frequency of flood events with a lead time up to ten years to quantify the temporal changes in the frequency of flood events during the historical and projection period we use poisson regression with time as predictor and focus on the sign and significance i e 5 and 10 level of the slope coefficient we show these values only if the time series has at least five years of non zero flood counts furthermore we compute the difference between the average number of flood events during three consecutive periods of the 21st century i e 2005 2035 2036 2069 2070 2099 and the historical period i e 1976 2005 to quantify the magnitude of these changes 4 results and discussion in this section we focus on the results based on a threshold that gives two event per year on average because the results for the other threshold values are similar see supplemental material fig 3 shows the best models that were selected at every gauging station and the corresponding correlation coefficient between observed and predicted flood counts time series for each season and for a flood threshold value that gives two peaks per year on average the same results for all the flood threshold values are shown in figures s1 and s2 of the supplemental material the p and p m models are selected at most of the stations suggesting that precipitation and antecedent wetness conditions are the two most important drivers of the frequency of flood events the mixed model is selected only in the northern stations during spring where temperature and antecedent wetness conditions are crucial for snow related flood generating processes lastly the p t model is the best model only in few stations with no significant consistency in space or season these results are consistent with previous similar analyses neri et al 2019a 2019b slater and villarini 2016 2017 which show that the frequency of flood events during spring at stations in the northern great plains is driven by a combination of temperature and antecedent wetness conditions and that precipitation is an important driver particularly during summer because across much of the study area the only drivers responsible for the frequency of flood events are precipitation and antecedent wetness conditions it is clear that changes in this flood hazard during the 21st century are mostly driven by projected changes in precipitation rather than temperature the skill of the poisson regression statistical models in reproducing the observed flood counts is overall good with an average correlation coefficient among the different seasons of 0 56 fig 3 consult neri et al 2019b for a more detailed evaluation of the model performance the trends of the seasonal frequency of flood events during the historical period for the flood threshold value that gives two peaks per year on average and according to the observations and to the median of the poisson regression model when using observations loca and na cordex datasets are shown in fig 4 figure s3 of the supplemental material shows the same results also for the other threshold values in general the poisson regression models using the observed precipitation and temperature as predictors are able to well reproduce the trends in the observed number of flood events compare the first and second columns of fig 4 these trends in the frequency of flood events are consistent with those obtained in mallakpour and villarini 2015 and neri et al 2019b with respect to a comparable historical period moreover these findings further support what mentioned in the introduction i e that it is the frequency of flood events rather than its magnitude villarini et al 2011 mallakpour and villarini 2015 which presents significant trends the statistical models forced with the na cordex well reproduce the observed positive and negative trends during all seasons except for winter where many trends in central indiana northern illinois and southern michigan are different the loca dataset also performs comparatively well even though it presents some trends which are discordant with the observations the two datasets behave similarly with respect to the spring season where most of the gauging stations present positive trends in agreement with the observations these findings are similar also for the trends obtained using a flood threshold value that gives 3 and 4 peaks per year on average figure s3 of the supplemental material the acceptable skill of the statistical models in reproducing the observed frequency of flood events when forced with climate observations and the ensemble of the historical runs by the gcms enables us to use the same models to project future changes in the frequency of flood events up to the end of the 21st century fig 5 shows the trends in the frequency of flood events over the 2006 2100 period based on the loca and na cordex dataset these results suggest that flood events are projected to become more frequent during the 21st century across much of the u s midwest during winter and spring the fall season presents instead spatially consistent negative trends with respect to the summer season no reliable conclusions can be drawn because the two datasets provide discordant results to quantify the magnitude of these changes fig 6 shows the difference between the average flood counts during three different future periods i e 2006 2035 2036 2069 and 2070 2099 compared to the last 30 years of the historical period 1976 2005 according to the loca and na cordex ensemble at a very general level we project a considerable increase in the frequency of flood events during winter and spring with larger changes as we move towards the end of the 21st century in particular the largest increases in the frequency of flood events occur in the stations located in the northern great plains during spring suggesting that projected precipitation during the wintertime and temperature play an important role in driving the future changes of the frequency of flood events in the context of snowmelt and potential changes in the seasonality of precipitation the winter season is subject to a considerable increase in flood events especially at stations located in the south eastern part of the domain that experience flooding associated with atmospheric rivers and extratropical cyclones e g lavers and villarini 2013 nakamura et al 2013 nayak and villarini 2017 with regards to summer and fall the results obtained using loca and na cordex fig 6 suggest that there is not a strong change at least compared to spring in terms of flood counts during the 21st century these last findings appear to be in contrast with many studies showing that precipitation is projected to slightly decrease during summer and fall in the u s midwest i e byun and hamlet 2018 swain and hayhoe 2015 which should lead to a reduction in the number of flood events one way to reconcile these discrepancies is by considering that the projected decrease in precipitation is small during these seasons see also winkler et al 2012 therefore at the stations where the model with precipitation as the only predictor is selected there are minor or no changes in the frequency of flood events leading to a muted response moreover some of the positive trends can be due to the possible increase in precipitation towards the end of the 21stcentury which leads to an increase in thefrequency of these events becausethose are the years that exert a significant leverage in terms of detected trends it is worth pointing out that these results are based on the assumption that the regression coefficients of the drivers of the best models estimated on the 1940 2005 period are the same also for the 2006 2100 projection period to gain insights with respect to the validity of this assumption we use a splitting sample validation approach we calibrate the statistical models on the 1940 1977 period and then we estimate the median of the poisson distribution on the 1978 2016 period i e the validation period figure s7 of the supplemental material shows the correlation coefficient between the observed and modeled flood counts over the validation period the models present good skill in reproducing the interannual variability of flood counts suggesting that the parameters of the best drivers obtained during the calibration period are also representative of the rainfall runoff processes of the following period even though this test provides encouraging results regarding the reliability and performance of our statistical models over the observational period it does not ensure the same robustness with respect to the projection period because we do not know how the future hydrological system is going to behave the uncertainties associated with the above mentioned assumption represent therefore a limitation of our approach which is however an attribute of information and therefore does not mean lack of knowledge blöschl and montanari 2010 we took these uncertainties into consideration in our results given that we developed probabilistic models rather than deterministic outputs 5 conclusions in this study we used a statistical approach to investigate the projected changes in the seasonal frequency of flood events during the 21st century at 286 usgs station across the u s midwest the results are based on downscaled and bias corrected gcm outputs and the rcp 8 5 the selection of the flood events is carried out through a peak over threshold approach and considering four different flood threshold values compared to previous studies here we provide a regional perspective of the projected changes in the frequency of flood events the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows the trends over the historical period 1950 2005 based on the na cordex reproduce reasonably well those from the observations especially during spring the loca dataset also performs well with the exception of the summer season where most of the trends have opposite signs with respect to the observations our findings suggest that the spring season is projected to experience a substantial increase in the frequency of flood events during the 21st century across much of the study region and in particular across the northern great plains the average number of flood events is also projected to increase in the winter especially in the south eastern part of the domain which is within the storm track of the extratropical cyclones despite summer and fall present statistically significant trends the change of the average number of flood counts is negligible for most of the gauging stations it is worth reminding that these results are based on the extrapolation of the modeling results for the historical period to the future this means that we assumed that the relationship between the response variable and the predictor s is expected to remain constant moreover we also assumed that the performance of the gcms for the historical period is a reflection of their performance in the future this framework provides a simple and rapid methodology to assess projected changes in flood events which can be further updated and improved

5684,this paper describes projected frequency changes in extreme summer meteorological and hydrological droughts over north american catchments it uses two large ensemble climate models 50 member canesm2 and 40 member cesm1 under the rcp 8 5 scenario to robustly assess frequency changes up to the 100 year drought relative to the 1980 2009 reference period meteorological droughts linked solely to precipitation deficit are represented by the 1 month standardized precipitation index spi whereas hydrological droughts are characterized by the 1 month streamflow drought index sdi based on hydrological simulation using a lumped hydrological model results show widely different patterns for future changes in extreme meteorological versus hydrological droughts future meteorological droughts show patterns of increasing and decreasing frequency that roughly match future expected changes of mean summer precipitation although some regions are nonetheless projected to see more frequent extreme meteorological droughts despite increases in mean summer precipitation the frequency changes for the 100 year meteorological droughts can be quite severe with up to a 20 fold increase observed over some watersheds on the other hand hydrological droughts which combine the effect of precipitation and temperature changes show a mostly uniform pattern of large to very large increases in drought frequency this shows that the projected temperature increase is a main driver of future extreme hydrological droughts enough to overcome the projected increase in mean summer precipitation for many north american catchments projected changes in both meteorological and hydrological droughts get consistently worse for the longer considered return periods in other words frequency changes for the 100 year droughts are more significant than those expected for the 2 and 20 year droughts this gradual worsening toward larger extremes has potentially large societal and economic impacts the large projected increases in the frequency of extreme hydrological drought frequency up to 27 times are likely to severely stress water management systems across north america keywords climate change large ensemble climate models extreme droughts north america frequency analysis 1 introduction the frequency of many extreme natural hazards such as floods and droughts is expected to increase as global temperatures rise due to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere cai et al 2015 fischer and knutti 2015 lelieveld et al 2016 martel et al 2019 martel et al 2018 rupp et al 2017 droughts have often been regarded as the most severe natural disaster because other catastrophes such as floods are typically restricted to relatively localized areas and over a well defined time interval vicente serrano et al 2011 droughts are responsible for land degradation famine and epidemics in emerging nations and for large economic losses in developed regions nicholson 2001 drought is defined as a temporary and periodic natural phenomenon which is characterized by below normal precipitation above normal temperature low relative humidity below average cloud cover or any combination thereof dai 2011 droughts can be classified into four primary categories meteorological droughts agricultural droughts hydrological droughts and socio economic droughts meteorological droughts are characterized by a precipitation deficit and are closely related to other types of droughts hannaford et al 2011 the onset of agricultural droughts depends on antecedent soil moisture conditions and may therefore lag the start of meteorological droughts heim 2002 hydrological droughts occur when a precipitation deficit propagates to the surface or subsurface water level resulting in difficulties supporting normal water usage dai 2011 wilhite and glantz 1985 socio economic droughts for their part occur when water shortage starts to affect people supply and demand for economic goods hayes et al 2011 there are many recent examples of severe north american droughts resulting in significant socio economic impacts in recent years droughts in the united states u s have led to nearly 9 billion in annual losses ncdc 2013 in california the economic impacts of droughts on agriculture led to nearly 4700 job losses and to a 604 million gross sales deficit in 2016 alone medellín azuara et al 2016 in canada recurrent major droughts affect the interior valley of british columbia bc and the prairies bonsal et al 2011 masud et al 2015 the provincial government of bc relocated 2800 cattle and paid around 2 million to replace damaged fencing due to the droughts in 2017 cherneski 2018 eastern north american droughts typically affect smaller areas and have a shorter duration than their central and western counterparts but are nonetheless liable to have significant economic impacts bonsal et al 2004 understanding the evolution of future droughts in a changing climate is of great economic importance in terms of the capacity to implement efficient adaptation measures anchukaitis et al 2016 used climate model data from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 ensemble taylor et al 2012 as well as paleoclimatic data last millennium ensemble lme to assess past current and future droughts in western north america they found that precipitation played a dominant role in controlling the occurrence and characteristics of past droughts in paleoclimate records whereas evapotranspiration associated with the future increasing temperature would dominate the trends for future droughts tam et al 2018 projected future changes in meteorological droughts by using 29 global circulation models gcms under three emission scenarios in canada and found that drought frequency would increase in south west canada and the prairies with larger inter annual variability in the latter half of the 21st century prudhomme et al 2014 used 7 global impact models gims and 5 gcms under 4 representative concentration pathways rcps to study future hydrological droughts they predicted a positive trend in the severity of hydrological droughts at the global scale by the end of the 21st century 2070 2099 wanders et al 2015 applied a global hydrological model pcr globewb forced by 5 gcms under 4 rcps to simulate global daily streamflow at a 0 5 grid resolution from 1971 to 2099 droughts in this study were defined by conventional based on the reference period and transient based on the previous 30 years thresholds respectively results showed that roughly half of total land surface would experience a decreasing trend in low flows other studies have looked at megadroughts which can have multi decadal to century long durations and can have lasting impacts on water availability and even lead to population migrations using tree ring records starting from a d 600 helama et al 2009 explored impacts of enso anomalies on precipitation deficit during the medieval anomaly cook et al 2010 also used tree rings to generate a 700 year reconstruction of monsoon patterns over asia this reconstruction outlined monsoon failures and megadroughts comparatively much fewer studies have looked at extreme droughts defined herein as having a longer return period t 20 years rather than by the extreme magnitude of drought indices marengo and espinoza 2016 roudier et al 2016 extreme droughts despite their low probability of occurrence typically carry a much larger proportion of the expectancy of drought losses across the entire drought spectrum coumou and rahmstorf 2012 this is because adaptation measures that are typically in place to deal with these frequent droughts are largely ineffective against their more extreme counterparts extreme droughts are also more difficult to study due to the large statistical uncertainty related to short historical data series the focus of this work is therefore on the study of the evolution of future extreme summer meteorological and hydrological droughts and on comparing trends to those of more frequent droughts this paper is organized as follows sections 2 and 3 respectively describe the datasets used in this work and the methodological aspects results are shown in section 4 the discussion and conclusions are respectively presented in sections 5 and 6 2 data the watershed data used in this study comes from a combination of canadian and u s databases for canada hydrometeorological data and boundaries of 532 watersheds come from the canadian model parameter experiment canopex database arsenault et al 2016 observed precipitation and temperature data are basin averaged the canadian watersheds are well distributed over canada with the exception of the prairie areas for the u s meteorological data comes from the gridded dataset of maurer et al 2002 this dataset is interpolated to a 0 125 0 125 grid and has been widely used in drought and climate change impact studies liu et al 2017 mazrooei and sankarasubramanian 2019 sheffield et al 2004 there are now several other interpolated gridded climate datasets available over the continental united states e g abatzoglou 2013 livneh et al 2013 despite minor differences between these existing datasets essou et al 2016 showed that they were statistically equivalent with respect to their performance in lumped hydrological modeling over most u s catchments streamflow and watershed boundary data in the u s were extracted from the united states geological survey usgs database for 5265 watersheds the combination of the canadian and us datasets lead to a total of 5797 watersheds ninety percent of all watersheds have a size ranging between 536 and 35 000 km2 the u s was divided into six regions from west to east west us high plains south midwest southeast northeast and canada into 4 regions for easier comparison the choice of these 6 regions in the u s was based on the us drought monitor https droughtmonitor unl edu a map showing the centroid of all north american watersheds and ten regions is shown in fig 1 to assess the future climate two climate model large ensembles were used in this study the canadian earth system model canesm2 is a 50 member ensemble run at a spatial resolution of 2 8 2 8 to produce the 50 member ensemble historical forcing was applied to five different members to obtain different ocean states over the 1850 1950 period five members were perturbed 10 times using historical forcing to 2005 and by the rcp 8 5 afterward leading to a total of 50 members over the 1950 2100 period arora et al 2011 sigmond and fyfe 2016 the community earth system model cesm1 is a 40 member ensemble run at a spatial resolution of 1 1 covering the 1920 2100 period each member is obtained from random atmospheric perturbations using historical forcing to 2005 and the rcp 8 5 afterward until 2100 details can be found in kay et al 2015 3 methodology in this paper meteorological and hydrological droughts are analyzed for 5797 north american watersheds over the 1980 2009 historical period as well as for the near 2036 2065 and far future 2070 2099 periods the results presented in this paper for future droughts are based on climate model outputs to evaluate the potential differences between climate model simulated and observed drought patterns some level of validation against observations is required while climate models have shown their ability to simulate the current climate and its variability at the global scale flato et al 2013 there may be significant differences at the regional scale simulated meteorological outputs precipitation maximum and minimum daily temperature for each watershed were averaged from a minimum of the four grid points closest to its centroid climate model precipitation was first compared against observations over the 1980 2009 reference period the ensemble mean of total summer precipitation was used as a first comparison criterion since droughts originate from temporal variability in precipitation fields the standard deviation of total summer precipitation was used as a second comparison criterion standard deviation of 30 50 values to perform the climate change impact analysis at the watershed scale climate model outputs were bias corrected to account for spatial differences and model structural errors maraun et al 2010 seager and vecchi 2010 failing to correct for these biases may result in unrealistic streamflow simulations over the reference period as well as over the future periods specifically the daily bias correction method dbc of chen et al 2013 2019 was adopted in this work the dbc is a combination of the daily translation method which is a quantile mapping approach mpelasoka and chiew 2009 and the local intensity scaling loci approach loci is used to correct the occurrence of precipitation to keep the wet day frequencies identical to observations for the reference period chen et al 2013 schmidli et al 2006 this study was performed at the watershed scale using a lumped hydrological model see below all meteorological inputs were therefore averaged to the watershed scale bias correction factors were consequently computed between the climate model and watershed averaged precipitation and temperature with no prior downscaling step the factors were kept the same for each member bias corrected climate model precipitation and temperature data were used as inputs to a hydrological model to simulate streamflows over the reference and future periods simulated streamflows were analyzed to assess changes in hydrological droughts daily streamflows were computed using the gr4j hydrological model perrin et al 2003 coupled with the cemaneige snow module valéry et al 2014 gr4j cemaneige is a reservoir based lumped rainfall runoff model the required inputs for this coupled model are temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet the pet is calculated using the oudin et al 2005 formula which is a simple yet highly optimized temperature based pet model there are several equations for calculating pet including mass transfer radiation and temperature based methods and the relative performance of these equations has been shown to be dependent on the study area xu and singh 2002 the penman monteith equation is recommended by food and agriculture organization fao as its preferred and most reliable approach in addition it is generally agreed that a more physically based pet formula should be preferred for climate change impact studies however such formulas rely on additional climate variables such as humidity radiation and wind speed that are not widely available for large scale studies such as this one this brings significant limitations to its applicability in most areas rojas and sheffield 2013 oudin et al 2005 assessed the impact of using various pet formulas on the outflows simulated by a daily rainfall runoff model over 308 catchments in different climatic zones results showed that temperature and radiation based equations performed similarly with the chosen lumped hydrological model based on these results the proposed oudin et al 2005 formula was found to be the most efficient for use with the gr4j hydrological model also used in this work this hydrological model has also been successfully used in several studies over north america arsenault et al 2015 troin et al 2015 troin et al 2018 velázquez et al 2015 to calibrate the hydrological model daily streamflow data over the 1950 2010 period was used and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 was taken as the optimal function following calibration watersheds with kge calibration values below 0 3 were removed this cutoff resulted in 4521 watersheds being retained the performance of gr4j cemaneige oudin is shown in fig 2 in order to study meteorological droughts over different climatological periods drought indices must be chosen several drought indices are typically applied in practice to assess meteorological droughts in this study the standardized precipitation index spi was chosen based on the recommendation of the world meteorological organization that it could be used as a standard index for tracking meteorological droughts it has also been widely used in many studies kattelus et al 2016 kumar et al 2016 kwon et al 2019 preethi et al 2019 it is a robust sensitive index which can be used to monitor precipitation deficit at various temporal scales pai et al 2011 stricevic et al 2011 the spi is a dimensionless indicator which characterizes the precipitation deficit relative to the long term mean at a given location and for a given time scale mckee et al 1993 mckee et al 1995 a positive spi index indicates above average precipitation over a given time scale spi is typically computed at time scales ranging from 1 to 24 months this work focused on the 1 month spi since the latter is computed over a short term window it is most often associated with meteorological droughts svoboda et al 2012 although it can also be the end result of much longer dry sequences affecting soil moisture in temperate climates short term hydrological droughts are typically the most problematic and drought durations as small as 7 days are often used to characterize their magnitude meteorological droughts on the other hand are often defined by durations of one to several months the 1 month duration was therefore found to be a good compromise to bridge the gap between short term hydrological and meteorological droughts the procedure for computing spi values consists in fitting an appropriate distribution typically the 2 parameter gamma distribution to precipitation data and mapping it to a normal distribution the index represents the normal deviates of this normal distribution more details can be found in guttman 1999 spi values with return periods ranging from 2 to 100 years were estimated to assess the influence of climate change on extreme meteorological drought frequency in future periods a standardized drought indicator is also required for the analysis of the potential evolution of future hydrological droughts over a given time period vicente serrano et al 2011 the 1 month streamflow drought index sdi was chosen for hydrological droughts analysis because itissensitive to a wide range of droughtconditions nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 it is also region independent and analogousto the spi similar to the spi index computation a distribution function is fitted to the monthly streamflow data in this work six potential distributions were considered generalized pareto log logistic lognormal pearson type iii general extreme value gev and weibull distributions nalbantis 2008 vicente serrano et al 2011 the choice of the most appropriate distribution for each watershed was based on the best monthly fit bmf approach of siegel 1956 this study was concerned with extreme droughts the use of simulations from two climate model large ensembles allowed for the computation of a very large number of years for all considered 30 year periods for each 30 year time period canesm2 provides a sample of 1500 equivalent years 50 30 due to the ergodic properties of the climate system for cesm1 the number of equivalent years for each period is 1200 years 40 30 this allows for the computation of large return periods up to 100 years using directly obtained empirical distributions in the real world the analysis of extremes is typically based on a small number of years a distribution e g the gev distribution is fitted to this small sample with subsequent extrapolation to larger return periods this extrapolation results in progressively larger confidence intervals as the return period increases in this work the empirical return period of future drought was calculated using cunnane s formula 1978 t n 0 2 m 0 4 where n is the number of years and m is the rank the m th smallest value the cunnane plotting formula provides an unbiased estimate of quantiles and has commonly been used in hydrological studies ehmele and kunz 2019 wang et al 2019 zhang and singh 2006 for both climate ensembles and three 30 year periods drought return periods were calculated by picking the smallest summer spi or sdi value for each of the 1500 canesm2 and 1200 cesm1 years thus allowing for a precise evaluation of rare droughts return periods of 2 20 and 100 year droughts were computed based on the reference period distribution the 2 year drought represents a typical drought that should be exceeded every other year on average with a probability of exceedance of 0 5 the 20 and 100 year droughts represent extreme droughts that are only to be exceeded every 20 and 100 years on average this translates into a probability of exceedance respectively equal to 0 05 and 0 01 4 results 4 1 climate model validation figs 3 and 4 show the ensemble mean of total summer precipitation as well as its standard deviation for observation and for both climate model large ensembles over the reference period results are presented for each watershed and not at the grid point scale and as such are consistent and comparable with the upcoming results for hydrological droughts patterns although there are differences between all three datasets at the local scale both models are in agreement with respect to the representation of the spatial patterns of mean total summer precipitation and inter annual variability over north america cesm1 tends to be closer to observations than canesm2 and especially over the u s midwest as shown in fig 4 canesm2 generally underestimates the mean total summer precipitation for most watersheds over the reference period while cesm1 performs very well for most watersheds with the exception of the driest ones neither climate model shows obvious biases when simulating the standard deviation of total summer precipitation to further explore the models performance in simulating the standard deviation of summer precipitation differences between the models and observations are shown in fig 5 both models overestimate the standard deviation in the canadian prairies and the western u s northwest and south and underestimate the standard deviation in east canada in addition cesm1 overestimates the standard deviation in the northeast and southeast u s and underestimates it in the midwest and south canesm2 underestimates the standard deviation of summer precipitation in the midwest northeast and southeast and overestimates the standard deviation in the south in general the difference between the observations and climate models was smaller in cesm1 the climate models temperature outputs were also validated similarly to summer precipitation the results are shown in supplementary fig s1 to fig s3 summer temperature is well represented by both climate model ensembles inter model differences are much smaller for temperature than for precipitation spatial variability is reproduced slightly better by cesm1 summer temperature is overestimated in the western part of north america and underestimated in the eastern part in cesm1 while canesm2 overestimates the standard deviation over most of north america with the exception of central ca 4 2 future meteorological droughts this paper looked at 2 20 and 100 year droughts for two future time periods patterns were found to be very similar for both horizons and return periods with the only difference being the change of magnitude in the more distant future accordingly the main body of this paper will focus on the 100 year droughts over the more distant time horizon 2070 2099 the 2 year drought patterns are also shown to outline any potential difference between frequent and extreme drought patterns in the future results for 20 year droughts and the 2036 2065 period are presented in the supplementary material figs s4 and s5 fig 6 presents the expected frequency change of future 2 year and 100 year meteorological droughts deficit in precipitation for both ensembles these figures only show the relative change of future drought frequency rather than the drought severity similarly to what martel et al 2019 2018 did the spatial pattern for the 2 and 100 year droughts are very similar indicating that changes in moderate and extreme meteorological droughts head in the same direction for each climate model there are however obvious differences between the two climate models in both the direction and magnitude of the changes both climate models predict a worsening of summer meteorological droughts over most of canada west and central canada midwest and over the coast in southeast u s along the gulf of mexico there are large differences over the high plains and the east canada cesm1 consistently predicts direr future meteorological droughts with the exception of southern texas and the northeast the worst changes in the 100 year meteorological drought frequency are observed in florida with up to a ten fold increase for canesm2 the current 100 year meteorological drought becoming a 10 year drought in the distant future and a 20 fold increase for cesm1 since meteorological droughts were assessed based on precipitation deficit alone it is important to assess changes in future summer precipitation to better understand the link between mean and extreme changes in droughts fig 7 presents the relative change of total summer precipitation for both climate models for the distant future relative to the historical period the precipitation change patterns for both climate models indicate a broadly similar pattern of decreasing summer precipitation in the north with an increasing trend in most of the u s a comparison of figs 6 and 7 shows that the spatial patterns are very similar indicating a strong correlation between changes in extreme summer meteorological drought frequency and relative changes in mean total summer precipitation changes in future summer precipitation explain most of the differences in meteorological drought patterns observed in fig 6 there are however minor regional differences such as the western u s coast for cesm1 where the 100 year droughts become less frequent despite projected decreases in summer precipitation 4 3 future hydrological droughts meteorological droughts are due mainly to precipitation deficit while the process leading to hydrological droughts are more complex because they are the result of the non linear interactions between climatic variables fig 8 presents changes for the 2 and 100 year hydrological droughts for the 2070 2099 period changes for the 20 year hydrological droughts and for the 2036 2065 period are shown in figs s6 and s7 respectively in comparison to meteorological droughts results are much more consistent between climate models both models show large increases of frequency in hydrological droughts over almost all north american watersheds including areas with increasing summer precipitation the situation gets worse at the larger return periods increases in the 100 year drought frequencies can be as large as 22 times in canesm2 and 27 times in cesm1 relative to the reference period the rocky mountains parts in west u s and high plains and the canadian west coast are the only regions where a few watersheds do not see increases in hydrological drought frequency the increasing frequency of future extreme hydrological droughts is clearly larger than that for future meteorological droughts 5 discussion this paper assessed the climate change impacts on the change of future droughts with 2 20 and 100 year return periods results showed that the spatial patterns of changes are similar for all three return periods however changes in magnitude get larger for the longer return period this progressively larger increase for longer return periods has equally been noted by others e g martel et al 2019 for precipitation ranging from 1 h to 5 days and boo et al 2006 for temperature and results from changes in future inter annual climate variability changes for longer return periods are important since extreme events almost always lead to the largest socio economic losses as has been observed in many other studies cook et al 2014 ipcc 2013 lelieveld et al 2016 tam et al 2018 projected changes are generally more important for the more distant future periods this is especially the case in this study where projected changes for hydrological droughts in the far future are more significant than those for meteorological droughts this is likely because the former represents the non linear combination of precipitation and temperature future changes in precipitation vary depending on the region see fig 7 sometimes helping to relieve drought problems whereas temperature are consistently increasing over the entire north american domain fig 9 projected mean summer temperature changes are very similar for both climate models with a south to north gradient of progressively larger increases canesm2 projects the largest increases and especially over canada temperature changes have no direct link with meteorological droughts but are an important driver of evapotranspiration thus impacting soil moisture and hydrological droughts in addition to the precipitation deficit by the end of the century the increase in temperature becomes the main driver of the hydrological drought process thus resulting in larger changes as compared to precipitation only driven changes for meteorological droughts the same factors can also explain the differences in spatial areas affected by meteorological and hydrological droughts spatial patterns of future extreme meteorological and hydrological droughts for both future periods are shown in figs s4 s5 and s6 s7 respectively while the changes in magnitude are shown in figs s8 and s9 along with table s1 while the general conclusions apply to the results of both large ensemble climate models used in this study there are nonetheless notable differences in spatial patterns for the meteorological and hydrological droughts and especially for meteorological droughts precipitation which is the main driver of the meteorological droughts presents larger inter model variability than temperature and this translates into large inter model uncertainty in meteorological drought assessment in addition the southern u s is a known region with large inter annual variability wang et al 2010 and so it is expected to see large differences in spatial patterns of meteorological droughts between the two climate models for extreme hydrological droughts the increasing temperature is likely to be responsible for the intensified evapotranspiration resulting in drier summer conditions since temperature displays less inter model variability the spatial patterns of extreme hydrological droughts are more consistent for both climate models in addition since cesm1 performed better against observed data over the reference period for both mean summer precipitation and inter annual variability it could be inferred that results based on this model are more reliable possibly in part due to its finer spatial resolution since precipitation deficit is the main driver of meteorological droughts it is perhaps intuitive to expect that more future precipitation would bring fewer droughts and vice versa however changes in variability may impact extremes differently figs 6 and 7 indicated that the main driver behind spatial patterns of extreme meteorological droughts appeared to result from future changes in summer precipitation amounts fig 10 further explores this by mapping the direction of the changes between precipitation and meteorological droughts four patterns are therefore mapped regions in blue decrease in precipitation and increase in drought noted p d and red p d are consistent with this intuitive understanding of changes regions in green p d show watersheds where an increase in precipitation nonetheless results in increasing meteorological drought frequencies these watersheds are usually located in the transition area between blue and red zones and become more common for the extreme droughts showing how increasing inter annual variability affecting extremes more than mean values the number of watersheds in purple p d indicating a decrease in extreme meteorological droughts despite a decrease in mean precipitation is very small purple areas are only found in dry areas of the southern u s for 2 year droughts and in the northwestern u s for 100 year droughts northwestern u s is more sensitive to climate variability and these gray regions might possibly see lower variability in future summer precipitation in opposition to meteorological droughts changes in hydrological droughts result from a combination of more than one variable and are more difficult to infer simply by looking at changes in precipitation and temperature alone as discussed above temperature increases appear to be the dominant factor in driving the large increases in hydrological drought frequency predicted for most of north america the process by which these changes affect droughts have not been systematically studied although they vary depending on watershed latitudes the projected decrease in summer precipitation will amplify this water shortage thus explaining the large increases in extreme drought frequency observed for those watersheds in the south increased evapotranspiration is somewhat overcome by the projected increase in summer precipitation thus resulting in less severe increases in drought frequency the hydrological drought frequency increase predictions over north american watersheds are in line with the findings of other studies burke and brown 2008 cook et al 2015 cook et al 2014 prudhomme et al 2014 tam et al 2018 increases in evapotranspiration driven by higher temperatures have been shown to have pronounced effects on droughts over the central plains these cover parts of south high plains and west canada in this work and western u s anchukaitis et al 2016 cook et al 2014 it is important to stress that several limitations may affect the results presented in this work two gcms are likely to be insufficient to robustly assess precipitation change over the u s where there is large inter model variability and especially so in the south wuebbles et al 2014 this is especially true for meteorological droughts however by choosing these two available large ensembles we were able to remove the uncertainty in the statistical estimation of extremes using many single member gcms would reduce the structural uncertainty at the expense of increasing the uncertainty of extreme computation droughts were only assessed under the rcp 8 5 emission scenario which is a pessimistic scenario corresponding to a pathway with higher emissions of greenhouse gases riahi et al 2011 because no other rcps were available for those large ensembles the world is currently on an extreme scenario pathway but this may change in the next decades this uncertainty is therefore more important for the more distant future period only two drought indices were used in this study spi for meteorological droughts and sdi for hydrological droughts the use of other indices may have led to different frequency increases since drought assessment is largely dependent on selection of indices burke and brown 2008 diffenbaugh et al 2015 finally a single hydrological model was used to compute projected future streamflows the hydrological model structure particularly for processes driving evapotranspiration may impact the computation of low flows chen et al 2011b troin et al 2018 wilby and harris 2006 this work has not focused on the physical processes leading to the above changes and how they propagate between both types of droughts more work should therefore focus on better understanding the factors controlling the onset duration and severity of agricultural and hydrological droughts this better understanding will lead to better adaptation to changing drought conditions diffenbaugh et al 2015 wanders and wada 2015 wang et al 2016 the likelihood of droughts can be related to sea surface temperature anomalies cook et al 2007 jiménez muñoz et al 2016 wang et al 2017 a full grasp of the potential linkage between the teleconnections and prolonged droughts conditions could allow for early warnings and preventive actions for water conservation and agricultural planning okumura et al 2017 last but not least the uncertainty envelop related to the modeling chain gcm esm rcp downscaling impact model drought index as discussed in other studies chen et al 2011a chen et al 2011b minville et al 2008 wilby and harris 2006 could be better delineated 6 conclusions this work looked at future trends of extreme short term meteorological and hydrological droughts over north america using two climate model canesm2 and cesm1 large ensembles the use of large ensembles allows for the robust estimation of 100 year droughts hydrological droughts were studied by using bias corrected climate model precipitation and temperature as inputs to the gr4j cemaneige oudin lumped hydrological model the standardized precipitation index and standardized drought index were used to respectively assess meteorological and hydrological future summer droughts the main conclusions of this work are as follows 1 both climate models performed well at reproducing observed mean summer precipitation and inter annual variability over the reference period cesm1 in particular displayed little to no bias for summer precipitation on all watersheds with the exception of some arid watersheds this gives confidence in the models ability to adequately project future droughts 2 trends for meteorological droughts which are mainly linked to precipitation deficit showed varying spatial patterns with some regions seeing increases west and central canada midwest and southeast coast and others seeing decreases in drought frequency the evolution of meteorological drought patterns matched future expected changes for mean summer precipitation because of changes in variability some regions e g southeast u s will nonetheless see increasing meteorological drought frequency despite increases in mean summer precipitation this is especially notable for the larger 100 year return period the median increase in meteorological droughts over north america would be roughly 2 fold in the far future 3 hydrological droughts which combine the effect of precipitation and temperature changes show a very uniform pattern of worsening droughts and that increases in temperature overcome the expected increasing mean summer precipitation in some regions the few watersheds escaping this trend are either located in colder climates canadian west coast rocky mountains or in regions with the largest projected increase in precipitation such as southern texas the frequency changes for the 100 year hydrological drought are quite severe for several watersheds with 4 3 fold median increase the 100 year drought becomes a 23 year drought but up to a 27 fold increase for the most affected watersheds 4 predicted changes for both meteorological and hydrological droughts get consistently worse for the longer considered return periods in other words frequency changes for the 100 year droughts are more significant than those expected for the 2 and 20 year droughts this gradual worsening toward larger extremes has been noted

5684,this paper describes projected frequency changes in extreme summer meteorological and hydrological droughts over north american catchments it uses two large ensemble climate models 50 member canesm2 and 40 member cesm1 under the rcp 8 5 scenario to robustly assess frequency changes up to the 100 year drought relative to the 1980 2009 reference period meteorological droughts linked solely to precipitation deficit are represented by the 1 month standardized precipitation index spi whereas hydrological droughts are characterized by the 1 month streamflow drought index sdi based on hydrological simulation using a lumped hydrological model results show widely different patterns for future changes in extreme meteorological versus hydrological droughts future meteorological droughts show patterns of increasing and decreasing frequency that roughly match future expected changes of mean summer precipitation although some regions are nonetheless projected to see more frequent extreme meteorological droughts despite increases in mean summer precipitation the frequency changes for the 100 year meteorological droughts can be quite severe with up to a 20 fold increase observed over some watersheds on the other hand hydrological droughts which combine the effect of precipitation and temperature changes show a mostly uniform pattern of large to very large increases in drought frequency this shows that the projected temperature increase is a main driver of future extreme hydrological droughts enough to overcome the projected increase in mean summer precipitation for many north american catchments projected changes in both meteorological and hydrological droughts get consistently worse for the longer considered return periods in other words frequency changes for the 100 year droughts are more significant than those expected for the 2 and 20 year droughts this gradual worsening toward larger extremes has potentially large societal and economic impacts the large projected increases in the frequency of extreme hydrological drought frequency up to 27 times are likely to severely stress water management systems across north america keywords climate change large ensemble climate models extreme droughts north america frequency analysis 1 introduction the frequency of many extreme natural hazards such as floods and droughts is expected to increase as global temperatures rise due to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere cai et al 2015 fischer and knutti 2015 lelieveld et al 2016 martel et al 2019 martel et al 2018 rupp et al 2017 droughts have often been regarded as the most severe natural disaster because other catastrophes such as floods are typically restricted to relatively localized areas and over a well defined time interval vicente serrano et al 2011 droughts are responsible for land degradation famine and epidemics in emerging nations and for large economic losses in developed regions nicholson 2001 drought is defined as a temporary and periodic natural phenomenon which is characterized by below normal precipitation above normal temperature low relative humidity below average cloud cover or any combination thereof dai 2011 droughts can be classified into four primary categories meteorological droughts agricultural droughts hydrological droughts and socio economic droughts meteorological droughts are characterized by a precipitation deficit and are closely related to other types of droughts hannaford et al 2011 the onset of agricultural droughts depends on antecedent soil moisture conditions and may therefore lag the start of meteorological droughts heim 2002 hydrological droughts occur when a precipitation deficit propagates to the surface or subsurface water level resulting in difficulties supporting normal water usage dai 2011 wilhite and glantz 1985 socio economic droughts for their part occur when water shortage starts to affect people supply and demand for economic goods hayes et al 2011 there are many recent examples of severe north american droughts resulting in significant socio economic impacts in recent years droughts in the united states u s have led to nearly 9 billion in annual losses ncdc 2013 in california the economic impacts of droughts on agriculture led to nearly 4700 job losses and to a 604 million gross sales deficit in 2016 alone medellín azuara et al 2016 in canada recurrent major droughts affect the interior valley of british columbia bc and the prairies bonsal et al 2011 masud et al 2015 the provincial government of bc relocated 2800 cattle and paid around 2 million to replace damaged fencing due to the droughts in 2017 cherneski 2018 eastern north american droughts typically affect smaller areas and have a shorter duration than their central and western counterparts but are nonetheless liable to have significant economic impacts bonsal et al 2004 understanding the evolution of future droughts in a changing climate is of great economic importance in terms of the capacity to implement efficient adaptation measures anchukaitis et al 2016 used climate model data from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 ensemble taylor et al 2012 as well as paleoclimatic data last millennium ensemble lme to assess past current and future droughts in western north america they found that precipitation played a dominant role in controlling the occurrence and characteristics of past droughts in paleoclimate records whereas evapotranspiration associated with the future increasing temperature would dominate the trends for future droughts tam et al 2018 projected future changes in meteorological droughts by using 29 global circulation models gcms under three emission scenarios in canada and found that drought frequency would increase in south west canada and the prairies with larger inter annual variability in the latter half of the 21st century prudhomme et al 2014 used 7 global impact models gims and 5 gcms under 4 representative concentration pathways rcps to study future hydrological droughts they predicted a positive trend in the severity of hydrological droughts at the global scale by the end of the 21st century 2070 2099 wanders et al 2015 applied a global hydrological model pcr globewb forced by 5 gcms under 4 rcps to simulate global daily streamflow at a 0 5 grid resolution from 1971 to 2099 droughts in this study were defined by conventional based on the reference period and transient based on the previous 30 years thresholds respectively results showed that roughly half of total land surface would experience a decreasing trend in low flows other studies have looked at megadroughts which can have multi decadal to century long durations and can have lasting impacts on water availability and even lead to population migrations using tree ring records starting from a d 600 helama et al 2009 explored impacts of enso anomalies on precipitation deficit during the medieval anomaly cook et al 2010 also used tree rings to generate a 700 year reconstruction of monsoon patterns over asia this reconstruction outlined monsoon failures and megadroughts comparatively much fewer studies have looked at extreme droughts defined herein as having a longer return period t 20 years rather than by the extreme magnitude of drought indices marengo and espinoza 2016 roudier et al 2016 extreme droughts despite their low probability of occurrence typically carry a much larger proportion of the expectancy of drought losses across the entire drought spectrum coumou and rahmstorf 2012 this is because adaptation measures that are typically in place to deal with these frequent droughts are largely ineffective against their more extreme counterparts extreme droughts are also more difficult to study due to the large statistical uncertainty related to short historical data series the focus of this work is therefore on the study of the evolution of future extreme summer meteorological and hydrological droughts and on comparing trends to those of more frequent droughts this paper is organized as follows sections 2 and 3 respectively describe the datasets used in this work and the methodological aspects results are shown in section 4 the discussion and conclusions are respectively presented in sections 5 and 6 2 data the watershed data used in this study comes from a combination of canadian and u s databases for canada hydrometeorological data and boundaries of 532 watersheds come from the canadian model parameter experiment canopex database arsenault et al 2016 observed precipitation and temperature data are basin averaged the canadian watersheds are well distributed over canada with the exception of the prairie areas for the u s meteorological data comes from the gridded dataset of maurer et al 2002 this dataset is interpolated to a 0 125 0 125 grid and has been widely used in drought and climate change impact studies liu et al 2017 mazrooei and sankarasubramanian 2019 sheffield et al 2004 there are now several other interpolated gridded climate datasets available over the continental united states e g abatzoglou 2013 livneh et al 2013 despite minor differences between these existing datasets essou et al 2016 showed that they were statistically equivalent with respect to their performance in lumped hydrological modeling over most u s catchments streamflow and watershed boundary data in the u s were extracted from the united states geological survey usgs database for 5265 watersheds the combination of the canadian and us datasets lead to a total of 5797 watersheds ninety percent of all watersheds have a size ranging between 536 and 35 000 km2 the u s was divided into six regions from west to east west us high plains south midwest southeast northeast and canada into 4 regions for easier comparison the choice of these 6 regions in the u s was based on the us drought monitor https droughtmonitor unl edu a map showing the centroid of all north american watersheds and ten regions is shown in fig 1 to assess the future climate two climate model large ensembles were used in this study the canadian earth system model canesm2 is a 50 member ensemble run at a spatial resolution of 2 8 2 8 to produce the 50 member ensemble historical forcing was applied to five different members to obtain different ocean states over the 1850 1950 period five members were perturbed 10 times using historical forcing to 2005 and by the rcp 8 5 afterward leading to a total of 50 members over the 1950 2100 period arora et al 2011 sigmond and fyfe 2016 the community earth system model cesm1 is a 40 member ensemble run at a spatial resolution of 1 1 covering the 1920 2100 period each member is obtained from random atmospheric perturbations using historical forcing to 2005 and the rcp 8 5 afterward until 2100 details can be found in kay et al 2015 3 methodology in this paper meteorological and hydrological droughts are analyzed for 5797 north american watersheds over the 1980 2009 historical period as well as for the near 2036 2065 and far future 2070 2099 periods the results presented in this paper for future droughts are based on climate model outputs to evaluate the potential differences between climate model simulated and observed drought patterns some level of validation against observations is required while climate models have shown their ability to simulate the current climate and its variability at the global scale flato et al 2013 there may be significant differences at the regional scale simulated meteorological outputs precipitation maximum and minimum daily temperature for each watershed were averaged from a minimum of the four grid points closest to its centroid climate model precipitation was first compared against observations over the 1980 2009 reference period the ensemble mean of total summer precipitation was used as a first comparison criterion since droughts originate from temporal variability in precipitation fields the standard deviation of total summer precipitation was used as a second comparison criterion standard deviation of 30 50 values to perform the climate change impact analysis at the watershed scale climate model outputs were bias corrected to account for spatial differences and model structural errors maraun et al 2010 seager and vecchi 2010 failing to correct for these biases may result in unrealistic streamflow simulations over the reference period as well as over the future periods specifically the daily bias correction method dbc of chen et al 2013 2019 was adopted in this work the dbc is a combination of the daily translation method which is a quantile mapping approach mpelasoka and chiew 2009 and the local intensity scaling loci approach loci is used to correct the occurrence of precipitation to keep the wet day frequencies identical to observations for the reference period chen et al 2013 schmidli et al 2006 this study was performed at the watershed scale using a lumped hydrological model see below all meteorological inputs were therefore averaged to the watershed scale bias correction factors were consequently computed between the climate model and watershed averaged precipitation and temperature with no prior downscaling step the factors were kept the same for each member bias corrected climate model precipitation and temperature data were used as inputs to a hydrological model to simulate streamflows over the reference and future periods simulated streamflows were analyzed to assess changes in hydrological droughts daily streamflows were computed using the gr4j hydrological model perrin et al 2003 coupled with the cemaneige snow module valéry et al 2014 gr4j cemaneige is a reservoir based lumped rainfall runoff model the required inputs for this coupled model are temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet the pet is calculated using the oudin et al 2005 formula which is a simple yet highly optimized temperature based pet model there are several equations for calculating pet including mass transfer radiation and temperature based methods and the relative performance of these equations has been shown to be dependent on the study area xu and singh 2002 the penman monteith equation is recommended by food and agriculture organization fao as its preferred and most reliable approach in addition it is generally agreed that a more physically based pet formula should be preferred for climate change impact studies however such formulas rely on additional climate variables such as humidity radiation and wind speed that are not widely available for large scale studies such as this one this brings significant limitations to its applicability in most areas rojas and sheffield 2013 oudin et al 2005 assessed the impact of using various pet formulas on the outflows simulated by a daily rainfall runoff model over 308 catchments in different climatic zones results showed that temperature and radiation based equations performed similarly with the chosen lumped hydrological model based on these results the proposed oudin et al 2005 formula was found to be the most efficient for use with the gr4j hydrological model also used in this work this hydrological model has also been successfully used in several studies over north america arsenault et al 2015 troin et al 2015 troin et al 2018 velázquez et al 2015 to calibrate the hydrological model daily streamflow data over the 1950 2010 period was used and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 was taken as the optimal function following calibration watersheds with kge calibration values below 0 3 were removed this cutoff resulted in 4521 watersheds being retained the performance of gr4j cemaneige oudin is shown in fig 2 in order to study meteorological droughts over different climatological periods drought indices must be chosen several drought indices are typically applied in practice to assess meteorological droughts in this study the standardized precipitation index spi was chosen based on the recommendation of the world meteorological organization that it could be used as a standard index for tracking meteorological droughts it has also been widely used in many studies kattelus et al 2016 kumar et al 2016 kwon et al 2019 preethi et al 2019 it is a robust sensitive index which can be used to monitor precipitation deficit at various temporal scales pai et al 2011 stricevic et al 2011 the spi is a dimensionless indicator which characterizes the precipitation deficit relative to the long term mean at a given location and for a given time scale mckee et al 1993 mckee et al 1995 a positive spi index indicates above average precipitation over a given time scale spi is typically computed at time scales ranging from 1 to 24 months this work focused on the 1 month spi since the latter is computed over a short term window it is most often associated with meteorological droughts svoboda et al 2012 although it can also be the end result of much longer dry sequences affecting soil moisture in temperate climates short term hydrological droughts are typically the most problematic and drought durations as small as 7 days are often used to characterize their magnitude meteorological droughts on the other hand are often defined by durations of one to several months the 1 month duration was therefore found to be a good compromise to bridge the gap between short term hydrological and meteorological droughts the procedure for computing spi values consists in fitting an appropriate distribution typically the 2 parameter gamma distribution to precipitation data and mapping it to a normal distribution the index represents the normal deviates of this normal distribution more details can be found in guttman 1999 spi values with return periods ranging from 2 to 100 years were estimated to assess the influence of climate change on extreme meteorological drought frequency in future periods a standardized drought indicator is also required for the analysis of the potential evolution of future hydrological droughts over a given time period vicente serrano et al 2011 the 1 month streamflow drought index sdi was chosen for hydrological droughts analysis because itissensitive to a wide range of droughtconditions nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 it is also region independent and analogousto the spi similar to the spi index computation a distribution function is fitted to the monthly streamflow data in this work six potential distributions were considered generalized pareto log logistic lognormal pearson type iii general extreme value gev and weibull distributions nalbantis 2008 vicente serrano et al 2011 the choice of the most appropriate distribution for each watershed was based on the best monthly fit bmf approach of siegel 1956 this study was concerned with extreme droughts the use of simulations from two climate model large ensembles allowed for the computation of a very large number of years for all considered 30 year periods for each 30 year time period canesm2 provides a sample of 1500 equivalent years 50 30 due to the ergodic properties of the climate system for cesm1 the number of equivalent years for each period is 1200 years 40 30 this allows for the computation of large return periods up to 100 years using directly obtained empirical distributions in the real world the analysis of extremes is typically based on a small number of years a distribution e g the gev distribution is fitted to this small sample with subsequent extrapolation to larger return periods this extrapolation results in progressively larger confidence intervals as the return period increases in this work the empirical return period of future drought was calculated using cunnane s formula 1978 t n 0 2 m 0 4 where n is the number of years and m is the rank the m th smallest value the cunnane plotting formula provides an unbiased estimate of quantiles and has commonly been used in hydrological studies ehmele and kunz 2019 wang et al 2019 zhang and singh 2006 for both climate ensembles and three 30 year periods drought return periods were calculated by picking the smallest summer spi or sdi value for each of the 1500 canesm2 and 1200 cesm1 years thus allowing for a precise evaluation of rare droughts return periods of 2 20 and 100 year droughts were computed based on the reference period distribution the 2 year drought represents a typical drought that should be exceeded every other year on average with a probability of exceedance of 0 5 the 20 and 100 year droughts represent extreme droughts that are only to be exceeded every 20 and 100 years on average this translates into a probability of exceedance respectively equal to 0 05 and 0 01 4 results 4 1 climate model validation figs 3 and 4 show the ensemble mean of total summer precipitation as well as its standard deviation for observation and for both climate model large ensembles over the reference period results are presented for each watershed and not at the grid point scale and as such are consistent and comparable with the upcoming results for hydrological droughts patterns although there are differences between all three datasets at the local scale both models are in agreement with respect to the representation of the spatial patterns of mean total summer precipitation and inter annual variability over north america cesm1 tends to be closer to observations than canesm2 and especially over the u s midwest as shown in fig 4 canesm2 generally underestimates the mean total summer precipitation for most watersheds over the reference period while cesm1 performs very well for most watersheds with the exception of the driest ones neither climate model shows obvious biases when simulating the standard deviation of total summer precipitation to further explore the models performance in simulating the standard deviation of summer precipitation differences between the models and observations are shown in fig 5 both models overestimate the standard deviation in the canadian prairies and the western u s northwest and south and underestimate the standard deviation in east canada in addition cesm1 overestimates the standard deviation in the northeast and southeast u s and underestimates it in the midwest and south canesm2 underestimates the standard deviation of summer precipitation in the midwest northeast and southeast and overestimates the standard deviation in the south in general the difference between the observations and climate models was smaller in cesm1 the climate models temperature outputs were also validated similarly to summer precipitation the results are shown in supplementary fig s1 to fig s3 summer temperature is well represented by both climate model ensembles inter model differences are much smaller for temperature than for precipitation spatial variability is reproduced slightly better by cesm1 summer temperature is overestimated in the western part of north america and underestimated in the eastern part in cesm1 while canesm2 overestimates the standard deviation over most of north america with the exception of central ca 4 2 future meteorological droughts this paper looked at 2 20 and 100 year droughts for two future time periods patterns were found to be very similar for both horizons and return periods with the only difference being the change of magnitude in the more distant future accordingly the main body of this paper will focus on the 100 year droughts over the more distant time horizon 2070 2099 the 2 year drought patterns are also shown to outline any potential difference between frequent and extreme drought patterns in the future results for 20 year droughts and the 2036 2065 period are presented in the supplementary material figs s4 and s5 fig 6 presents the expected frequency change of future 2 year and 100 year meteorological droughts deficit in precipitation for both ensembles these figures only show the relative change of future drought frequency rather than the drought severity similarly to what martel et al 2019 2018 did the spatial pattern for the 2 and 100 year droughts are very similar indicating that changes in moderate and extreme meteorological droughts head in the same direction for each climate model there are however obvious differences between the two climate models in both the direction and magnitude of the changes both climate models predict a worsening of summer meteorological droughts over most of canada west and central canada midwest and over the coast in southeast u s along the gulf of mexico there are large differences over the high plains and the east canada cesm1 consistently predicts direr future meteorological droughts with the exception of southern texas and the northeast the worst changes in the 100 year meteorological drought frequency are observed in florida with up to a ten fold increase for canesm2 the current 100 year meteorological drought becoming a 10 year drought in the distant future and a 20 fold increase for cesm1 since meteorological droughts were assessed based on precipitation deficit alone it is important to assess changes in future summer precipitation to better understand the link between mean and extreme changes in droughts fig 7 presents the relative change of total summer precipitation for both climate models for the distant future relative to the historical period the precipitation change patterns for both climate models indicate a broadly similar pattern of decreasing summer precipitation in the north with an increasing trend in most of the u s a comparison of figs 6 and 7 shows that the spatial patterns are very similar indicating a strong correlation between changes in extreme summer meteorological drought frequency and relative changes in mean total summer precipitation changes in future summer precipitation explain most of the differences in meteorological drought patterns observed in fig 6 there are however minor regional differences such as the western u s coast for cesm1 where the 100 year droughts become less frequent despite projected decreases in summer precipitation 4 3 future hydrological droughts meteorological droughts are due mainly to precipitation deficit while the process leading to hydrological droughts are more complex because they are the result of the non linear interactions between climatic variables fig 8 presents changes for the 2 and 100 year hydrological droughts for the 2070 2099 period changes for the 20 year hydrological droughts and for the 2036 2065 period are shown in figs s6 and s7 respectively in comparison to meteorological droughts results are much more consistent between climate models both models show large increases of frequency in hydrological droughts over almost all north american watersheds including areas with increasing summer precipitation the situation gets worse at the larger return periods increases in the 100 year drought frequencies can be as large as 22 times in canesm2 and 27 times in cesm1 relative to the reference period the rocky mountains parts in west u s and high plains and the canadian west coast are the only regions where a few watersheds do not see increases in hydrological drought frequency the increasing frequency of future extreme hydrological droughts is clearly larger than that for future meteorological droughts 5 discussion this paper assessed the climate change impacts on the change of future droughts with 2 20 and 100 year return periods results showed that the spatial patterns of changes are similar for all three return periods however changes in magnitude get larger for the longer return period this progressively larger increase for longer return periods has equally been noted by others e g martel et al 2019 for precipitation ranging from 1 h to 5 days and boo et al 2006 for temperature and results from changes in future inter annual climate variability changes for longer return periods are important since extreme events almost always lead to the largest socio economic losses as has been observed in many other studies cook et al 2014 ipcc 2013 lelieveld et al 2016 tam et al 2018 projected changes are generally more important for the more distant future periods this is especially the case in this study where projected changes for hydrological droughts in the far future are more significant than those for meteorological droughts this is likely because the former represents the non linear combination of precipitation and temperature future changes in precipitation vary depending on the region see fig 7 sometimes helping to relieve drought problems whereas temperature are consistently increasing over the entire north american domain fig 9 projected mean summer temperature changes are very similar for both climate models with a south to north gradient of progressively larger increases canesm2 projects the largest increases and especially over canada temperature changes have no direct link with meteorological droughts but are an important driver of evapotranspiration thus impacting soil moisture and hydrological droughts in addition to the precipitation deficit by the end of the century the increase in temperature becomes the main driver of the hydrological drought process thus resulting in larger changes as compared to precipitation only driven changes for meteorological droughts the same factors can also explain the differences in spatial areas affected by meteorological and hydrological droughts spatial patterns of future extreme meteorological and hydrological droughts for both future periods are shown in figs s4 s5 and s6 s7 respectively while the changes in magnitude are shown in figs s8 and s9 along with table s1 while the general conclusions apply to the results of both large ensemble climate models used in this study there are nonetheless notable differences in spatial patterns for the meteorological and hydrological droughts and especially for meteorological droughts precipitation which is the main driver of the meteorological droughts presents larger inter model variability than temperature and this translates into large inter model uncertainty in meteorological drought assessment in addition the southern u s is a known region with large inter annual variability wang et al 2010 and so it is expected to see large differences in spatial patterns of meteorological droughts between the two climate models for extreme hydrological droughts the increasing temperature is likely to be responsible for the intensified evapotranspiration resulting in drier summer conditions since temperature displays less inter model variability the spatial patterns of extreme hydrological droughts are more consistent for both climate models in addition since cesm1 performed better against observed data over the reference period for both mean summer precipitation and inter annual variability it could be inferred that results based on this model are more reliable possibly in part due to its finer spatial resolution since precipitation deficit is the main driver of meteorological droughts it is perhaps intuitive to expect that more future precipitation would bring fewer droughts and vice versa however changes in variability may impact extremes differently figs 6 and 7 indicated that the main driver behind spatial patterns of extreme meteorological droughts appeared to result from future changes in summer precipitation amounts fig 10 further explores this by mapping the direction of the changes between precipitation and meteorological droughts four patterns are therefore mapped regions in blue decrease in precipitation and increase in drought noted p d and red p d are consistent with this intuitive understanding of changes regions in green p d show watersheds where an increase in precipitation nonetheless results in increasing meteorological drought frequencies these watersheds are usually located in the transition area between blue and red zones and become more common for the extreme droughts showing how increasing inter annual variability affecting extremes more than mean values the number of watersheds in purple p d indicating a decrease in extreme meteorological droughts despite a decrease in mean precipitation is very small purple areas are only found in dry areas of the southern u s for 2 year droughts and in the northwestern u s for 100 year droughts northwestern u s is more sensitive to climate variability and these gray regions might possibly see lower variability in future summer precipitation in opposition to meteorological droughts changes in hydrological droughts result from a combination of more than one variable and are more difficult to infer simply by looking at changes in precipitation and temperature alone as discussed above temperature increases appear to be the dominant factor in driving the large increases in hydrological drought frequency predicted for most of north america the process by which these changes affect droughts have not been systematically studied although they vary depending on watershed latitudes the projected decrease in summer precipitation will amplify this water shortage thus explaining the large increases in extreme drought frequency observed for those watersheds in the south increased evapotranspiration is somewhat overcome by the projected increase in summer precipitation thus resulting in less severe increases in drought frequency the hydrological drought frequency increase predictions over north american watersheds are in line with the findings of other studies burke and brown 2008 cook et al 2015 cook et al 2014 prudhomme et al 2014 tam et al 2018 increases in evapotranspiration driven by higher temperatures have been shown to have pronounced effects on droughts over the central plains these cover parts of south high plains and west canada in this work and western u s anchukaitis et al 2016 cook et al 2014 it is important to stress that several limitations may affect the results presented in this work two gcms are likely to be insufficient to robustly assess precipitation change over the u s where there is large inter model variability and especially so in the south wuebbles et al 2014 this is especially true for meteorological droughts however by choosing these two available large ensembles we were able to remove the uncertainty in the statistical estimation of extremes using many single member gcms would reduce the structural uncertainty at the expense of increasing the uncertainty of extreme computation droughts were only assessed under the rcp 8 5 emission scenario which is a pessimistic scenario corresponding to a pathway with higher emissions of greenhouse gases riahi et al 2011 because no other rcps were available for those large ensembles the world is currently on an extreme scenario pathway but this may change in the next decades this uncertainty is therefore more important for the more distant future period only two drought indices were used in this study spi for meteorological droughts and sdi for hydrological droughts the use of other indices may have led to different frequency increases since drought assessment is largely dependent on selection of indices burke and brown 2008 diffenbaugh et al 2015 finally a single hydrological model was used to compute projected future streamflows the hydrological model structure particularly for processes driving evapotranspiration may impact the computation of low flows chen et al 2011b troin et al 2018 wilby and harris 2006 this work has not focused on the physical processes leading to the above changes and how they propagate between both types of droughts more work should therefore focus on better understanding the factors controlling the onset duration and severity of agricultural and hydrological droughts this better understanding will lead to better adaptation to changing drought conditions diffenbaugh et al 2015 wanders and wada 2015 wang et al 2016 the likelihood of droughts can be related to sea surface temperature anomalies cook et al 2007 jiménez muñoz et al 2016 wang et al 2017 a full grasp of the potential linkage between the teleconnections and prolonged droughts conditions could allow for early warnings and preventive actions for water conservation and agricultural planning okumura et al 2017 last but not least the uncertainty envelop related to the modeling chain gcm esm rcp downscaling impact model drought index as discussed in other studies chen et al 2011a chen et al 2011b minville et al 2008 wilby and harris 2006 could be better delineated 6 conclusions this work looked at future trends of extreme short term meteorological and hydrological droughts over north america using two climate model canesm2 and cesm1 large ensembles the use of large ensembles allows for the robust estimation of 100 year droughts hydrological droughts were studied by using bias corrected climate model precipitation and temperature as inputs to the gr4j cemaneige oudin lumped hydrological model the standardized precipitation index and standardized drought index were used to respectively assess meteorological and hydrological future summer droughts the main conclusions of this work are as follows 1 both climate models performed well at reproducing observed mean summer precipitation and inter annual variability over the reference period cesm1 in particular displayed little to no bias for summer precipitation on all watersheds with the exception of some arid watersheds this gives confidence in the models ability to adequately project future droughts 2 trends for meteorological droughts which are mainly linked to precipitation deficit showed varying spatial patterns with some regions seeing increases west and central canada midwest and southeast coast and others seeing decreases in drought frequency the evolution of meteorological drought patterns matched future expected changes for mean summer precipitation because of changes in variability some regions e g southeast u s will nonetheless see increasing meteorological drought frequency despite increases in mean summer precipitation this is especially notable for the larger 100 year return period the median increase in meteorological droughts over north america would be roughly 2 fold in the far future 3 hydrological droughts which combine the effect of precipitation and temperature changes show a very uniform pattern of worsening droughts and that increases in temperature overcome the expected increasing mean summer precipitation in some regions the few watersheds escaping this trend are either located in colder climates canadian west coast rocky mountains or in regions with the largest projected increase in precipitation such as southern texas the frequency changes for the 100 year hydrological drought are quite severe for several watersheds with 4 3 fold median increase the 100 year drought becomes a 23 year drought but up to a 27 fold increase for the most affected watersheds 4 predicted changes for both meteorological and hydrological droughts get consistently worse for the longer considered return periods in other words frequency changes for the 100 year droughts are more significant than those expected for the 2 and 20 year droughts this gradual worsening toward larger extremes has been noted
