1850,compound hot dry extremes pose great threats to human health ecosystems and food production a lot of attention has been paid to compound meteorological hot dry extremes based on high near surface air temperature and low precipitation however there is a gap on the compound hydrological hot dry extremes based on high near surface air temperature and low surface runoff which is more directly related to damages on social and natural systems here using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition method and copula function based on multiple global gridded datasets during 1902 2019 we find that the globe is dominated by accumulated increases in zonal average of warm season i e may september in the northern hemisphere and november march in the southern hemisphere mean precipitation wmp while zonal average of warm season mean runoff wmr mainly shows accumulated decreases this discrepancy is possibly due to the modulation effect of zonally accelerated warming trends in warm season mean temperature wmt despite of the discrepancy in changes of individual wmp and wmr compound meteorological hot dry extremes from wmt and wmp show increased occurrence probability expanded affected area and enlarged spatial homogeneity i e connectedness and these features are worse for compound hydrological extremes from wmt and wmr both high wmt and low wmp can lead to negative anomalies of wmr however the negative anomalies of wmr can be largely amplified by additional low wmp under high wmt conditions the increased occurrence probability of compound hydrological hot dry extremes is directly related to wmt wmr and their dependence although a strong dependence is found between wmt and wmr especially at mid latitudes in the northern hemisphere attribution results show that increased wmt plays a dominant role in reducing return periods of compound hydrological hot dry extremes at the global scale our results provide a deeper understanding of changes in compound hydrological hot dry extremes at the global scale from a longer term period keywords compound meteorological hot dry extremes compound hydrological hot dry extremes accumulated changes occurrence probability attributions data availability the gridded temperature precipitation and runoff datasets are available in public see table 1 for the specific websites 1 introduction high temperatures meteorological droughts and hydrological droughts have serious impacts on human health wang et al 2022a ecosystems filipa silva ribeiro et al 2020 he et al 2022 mishra et al 2020 and social economy ridder et al 2020 due to large damages caused by these univariate extreme events their spatial and temporal dynamic evolution spatial extent moving speed and driving mechanisms have received extensive attention alizadeh et al 2020 guan et al 2022 luo et al 2022a 2022b mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 ridder et al 2020 wang et al 2022b yu et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 the occurrence probability severity and duration of univariate extreme events have shown significant increasing trends in recent decades gu et al 2019 2020 li et al 2023 mazdiyasni et al 2017 meehl and tebaldi 2004 satoh et al 2022 yu et al 2022 univariate extreme events cause incalculable damages to ecosystems and economy however damages caused by compound extreme events are often more severe sarhadi et al 2018 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 generally meteorological hot dry events usually indicated high temperatures and precipitation shortages while hydrological events focus on high temperatures and runoff deficit eze et al 2022 peterson et al 2021 ridder et al 2020 although hydrological hot dry events are more directly related to water scarcity and human productivity in comparison with meteorological hot dry events byers et al 2020 gómez gener et al 2020 tiwari et al 2022 changes in compound hot dry events from temperature and runoff at global scale are poorly understood the characteristics and drivers of changes in meteorological hot dry events at global and regional scales have been extensively studied mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 sarhadi et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 showed that the frequency of compound dry and hot extremes has increased substantially in the past few decades over the contiguous united states globally anthropogenic climate change has doubled the joint occurrence probability of years that are both hot and dry sarhadi et al 2018 meteorological hot dry events become more frequent more severe with longer duration implying that hydrological hot dry events could occur more commonly however hydrological hot dry events are also affected by land surface processes such as land evapotranspiration liu et al 2021 markonis et al 2021 deforestation of tropical rainforests chagas et al 2022 melting permafrost qiu 2012 therefore it is necessary to directly investigate changes in compound hydrological hot dry events at the global scale changes in compound events are directly driven by their univariate extreme events li et al 2022 wu et al 2021 for example changes in occurrence probability of compound meteorological hot dry events are directly linked to changes in the probability of extreme high temperature and extreme low precipitation as well as in the dependence between high temperature and low precipitation bevacqua et al 2019 alizadeh et al 2020 attributed the increased likelihood of compound meteorological hot dry extremes over the contiguous united states during the past 122 years to the observed warming trend bevacqua et al 2022 indicated that the future occurrence of global compound meteorological hot dry extremes will be modulated by mean precipitation trends these previous studies mainly focused on compound meteorological hot dry extremes however contributions of high temperature low runoff and their dependence to changes in occurrence probability of compound hydrological hot dry extremes are not quantified therefore in this study we aim to achieve the following three objectives 1 evaluating the spatial and temporal dynamics of global near surface air temperature precipitation and surface runoff 2 quantifying joint occurrence probability of compound hot dry extremes and 3 attributing changes in joint occurrence probability of compound hot dry extremes to two associated univariates and their dependence 2 data and methods 2 1 data two monthly gridded near surface air temperature datasets are obtained from the center for climatic research ccr university of delaware ud willmott and matsuura 2001 and from the climate research unit cru mitchell and jones 2005 respectively four monthly gridded precipitation datasets are provided by ccr ud cru the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc schneider et al 2011 and the gridded land surface extremes indices hadex3 created by the met office hadley centre dunn et al 2020 both the temperature and precipitation datasets are produced based on observations and more details on these datasets can be seen in table 1 the g run ensemble dataset is a monthly global surface runoff product at 0 5 spatial resolution during 1901 2019 firstly accounting for the uncertainty in historical hydrometeorological conditions ghiggi et al 2021 it is derived from a machine learning algorithm using an ensemble of 21 gridded atmospheric forcing datasets david et al 2022 the quality of g run runoff values was evaluated using a database of river discharge observations from large river basins and benchmarked against a comprehensive collection of publicly available global monthly runoff reconstructions during 1981 2010 ghiggi et al 2021 this runoff dataset has a wide range of applications including marine science xu et al 2022 terrestrial water storage lee et al 2022 and streamflow volumes masseroni et al 2021 due to the discrepancy in spatial resolution of these gridded datasets we aggregated them into a common 2 5 2 5 resolution using the second order conservative remapping method padrón et al 2020 considering the difference in magnitude of temperature precipitation between the two among the four datasets we first extracted the monthly anomalies by removing the mean of the corresponding month during the reference period 1981 2010 for example values in january minus the mean of all 30 values in january during the reference period and then calculated the multi dataset ensemble mean in the same way we also extracted the anomalies in runoff warm season i e may september in the northern hemisphere and november march in the southern hemisphere mean temperature wmt precipitation wmp and runoff wmr anomalies are used to define the compound hot dry extremes we limited our study regions between 60 n and 60 s data are almost not available in areas beyond these regions and masked the areas with annual total precipitation below 100 mm these areas are dominated by deserts the common period 1902 2019 of these datasets is taken as the study period 2 2 ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd in eemd a time series at a grid point x t e g wmt wmp or wmr in this study is decomposed as adaptively obtained amplitude frequency modulated oscillatory components known as intrinsic mode functions imf the sequential elimination of imfs c j j 1 2 n produces a residual r n a curve either monotonic or containing only one extremum from which no additional oscillatory components can be extracted chen et al 2020 ji et al 2014 sullivan et al 2021 vinnarasi et al 2017 1 x t j 1 n c j t r n t the extracted dynamic trend r n does not follow a priori shape this trend is also less sensitive to the boundary compared to the other commonly used methods hence the physical meaning of the time series will be retained even after appendage of data vinnarasi et al 2017 eemd has been widely applied in climate research chen et al 2020 stallone et al 2020 sullivan et al 2021 sun et al 2022 vinnarasi et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 here we diagnose the accumulated increment of the eemd trend at a given time from the reference time of 1902 representing accumulated change of wmt wmp or wmr from 1902 ji et al 2014 vinnarasi et al 2017 2 trend eemd t r n t r n 1902 as the trend i e trend eemd t is time varying the corresponding instantaneous rates which can be estimated by calculating temporal derivatives of trends are also temporally and spatially local quantities ji et al 2014 3 r a t e t trend eemd t 1 trend eemd t 1 2 2 3 joint occurrence probability and return period the copula function is used to describe the correlation between two even more variables and to derive their joint distribution feng et al 2020 qing et al 2022 it is an elegant and effective method for the proper multivariate investigation of joint occurrence probability vezzoli et al 2017 it is first proposed in statistics and now widely used in hydrological and meteorological studies feng et al 2020 hatami and nazemi 2022 mazdiyasni et al 2019 sadeghfam et al 2022 simanjuntak et al 2022 vezzoli et al 2017 in copula function x y are continuous random variables with distribution functions f and g respectively h is a function with marginal univariate distributions to describe their joint distribution all above can be expressed as alizadeh et al 2020 4 f x p x x g y p y y 5 h x y p x x y y then there is a copula c alizadeh et al 2020 6 h x y c f x g y here x y refer to wmt and wmp wmt and wmr respectively in this study the joint occurrence probability of compound hot dry extremes is zhou et al 2019b 7 p x x a n d y y g y c f x g y then their associated return period t and probability index pi are estimated as yue and rasmussen 2002 8 t 1 p x x a n d y y 1 g y c f x g y 9 p i 1 p x x a n d y y 1 g y c f x g y the return period such as t 50 indicates compound hot dry extremes on average occur in once in 50 years the probability index pi indicates the non exceeding probability of the compound hot dry extremes within the range of 0 1 lager pi value corresponds higher t we choose nonparametric methods to calculate univariate probabilities this relaxes the need for fitting parametric distributions to data these parametric distributions are associated with underlying assumptions and violation of the assumptions produces biased and unreliable results alizadeh et al 2020 the commonly used bivariate copula families include elliptical and archimedean copulas copulas are selected via akaike information criterion aic from the families gaussian t clayton gumbel frank joe bb1 bb6 bb7 and bb8 in the r package vinecopula function bicopselect https cran r project org web packages copula index html bevacqua et al 2019 zhou et al 2019b only frank is adopted at global grid cells to exclude the influence of different joint functions on the results probability multiplication factor pmf can quantify the strength of dependence between the two variables ridder et al 2020 zhou et al 2019b for example if the wmt is 10 years high temperature extremes and the wmp wmr is 10 years low precipitation runoff extremes the pmf of such compound high temperature and low precipitation runoff extremes are estimated as ridder et al 2020 zhou et al 2019b 10 p f x 0 9 a n d g y 0 1 0 1 c 0 9 0 1 p m f 0 1 c 0 9 0 1 0 1 0 1 when pmf 1 it means that hot and dry extremes are independent of each other when pmf 1 the larger pmf is the stronger the dependence between the two variables i e hot and dry extremes have strong dependence in this study 2 4 attribution of changes in return period of compound extremes changes in return periods such as in a given 25 year of compound hot dry extremes between two stages i e the first and last semi centuries 1902 1951 and 1970 2019 is denoted as bevacqua et al 2019 lai et al 2021 11 δ t t stage 2 t stage 1 t stage 1 100 where t stage 1 and t stage 2 are given as bevacqua et al 2019 lai et al 2021 12 t stage 1 1 g y stage 1 c stage 1 f x stage 1 g y stage 1 13 t stage 2 1 g y stage 2 c stage 2 f x stage 2 g y stage 2 as previous studies using season mean air temperature and precipitation to define compound hot dry extremes sarhadi et al 2018 alizadeh et al 2020 chiang et al 2022 we in this study define compound hot dry extremes as years with joint return periods of wmt and wmp wmr longer than 25 50 75 years for the compound wmt and wmp wmr its physical meaning is that the regions simultaneously experience severely warm conditions in conjunction with dry years i e low precipitation runoff sarhadi et al 2018 alizadeh et al 2020 chiang et al 2022 the change in return periods of compound hydrological hot dry events is driven by wmt wmr and the dependence between wmt and wmr there experiments are conduced to quantify contributions of the three drivers to changes in return periods of compound hydrological hot dry extremes i e δ t in eq 11 bevacqua et al 2019 lai et al 2021 a only considering the change in dependence between wmt and wmr eq 14 b only considering the wmt overall marginal distributions i e the wmt distribution without reference to wmr eq 15

driven or wmr driven changes in return periods of compound hydrological hot dry extremes between two periods note that the total return period change eq 17 is not given by the sum of these three experiences a b and c as the overall dependencies and marginal distributions do not contribute linearly to the joint return periods the relative contributions of the three drivers i e wmt wmr and the dependence between wmt and wmr to changes in return periods of compound hydrological hot dry extremes between two periods are estimated as bevacqua et al 2019 lai et al 2021 18 δ t exp i r e l a t i v e 100 δ t exp i i 1 3 δ t exp i 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatio temporal evolution in individual wmt wmp and wmr the spatial distribution of accumulated changes since 1902 in wmt wmp and wmr is shown in fig 1 prior to 1960 noticeable accumulated warming in wmt 1 5 c was sporadically distributed between 30 n and 60 n such as in europe fig 1a c the early sporadic warming has been expanding since 1960 s fig 1c e by 2019 evident accumulated warming 1 5 c extended to almost all mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere fig 1e allan et al 2021 ji et al 2014 accumulated changes in wmp show a complex pattern globally fig 1f j prior to 1980 accumulated wmp decreased especially in north america and australia fig 1f g then it shifted to increase over the next four decades after 1980 accumulated wmp in africa shifted from decrease to increase however wmp always has been shown as a strong accumulated decrease in the tibetan plateau over the past 118 years accumulated changes in wmp have a complex pattern in south america fig 1h g similar to wmp accumulated changes in wmr also show a complex spatial pattern globally fig 1k o noticeable decrease in wmr 4 mm was sporadic before 1980 mainly in south america and africa fig 1k m but since 2000 the areas showing decreasing wmr have gradually expanded and faced increasing hydrological drought fig 1n o satoh et al 2022 consistent with accumulated changes in wmp wmr has been declining for a century in europe and the tibetan plateau in north america decreasing changes in wmr have been continuously mitigated in north america wmr has been decreased in northeast asia in contrast to the increase in accumulated changes in wmp the spatial patterns of accumulated changes of wmt wmp and wmr are broadly consistent with those of instantaneous rates figs 1 2 in 1960 warming rate in wmt was relatively weak in almost all regions of the globe except europe in subsequent decades cooler regions shrank and warming 1 6 mm decade sharply expanded also see ji et al 2014 suggesting that the accumulated increase in temperature over recent decades will exceed the warming of the early 20th century fig 2a e the change rates in wmp and wmr are relatively similar both showing complex patterns globally fig 2f o wmp in north america has increased at a very high rate 1 4 mm decade especially since 1980 on the other hand wmp in vast areas of asia and europe has changed at a weak rate fig 2f g except for the obvious decline rate of wmr in africa and south america the change rate in wmr is relatively weak globally the accumulated change in wmp and wmr shifted from an initial increase to a later decrease in south america africa and northeast asia fig 1 which was supported by noticeable drying rates 1 2 mm decade in these regions fig 2 overall the spatial match of dynamics of wmp and wmr is complex in not only accumulated changes but also instantaneous rates for example increased accumulated wmp in north america and southern east asia can supply more water for wmr and then is conductive to increased accumulated wmr however increased accumulated wmp in northeastern east asia seems not work on the decreased accumulated wmr in this region possibly due to increased evapotranspiration induced by increased wmt for europe and north africa with complex changes in accumulated wmp the noticeable decreases in accumulated changes in wmr are closer to faster warming in the two regions these results imply that spatial patterns of changes in compound meteorological hot dry extremes may not be enough to reveal that in compound hydrological hot dry extremes zonally average accumulated changes in wmt wmp and wmr are shown in fig 3 there is a tongue structure to the zonally warming trend with noticeable warming 1 c firstly occurring in the mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere followed by the subtropical regions of the southern hemisphere fig 3a ji et al 2014 the fastest warming in mid high latitudes was also found in previous studies wu et al 2011 huang et al 2012 ji et al 2014 for example ji et al 2014 found that annual mean near surface air temperature in northern mid latitudes warms the fastest in recent decades huang et al 2012 reported that the arid and semiarid regions of the mid latitude northern hemisphere have the greatest warming possibly due to the small heat capacity of these regions on the other hand this fastest warming in mid high latitudes is associated with the amplified arctic warming francis et al 2017 rantanen et al 2022 rantanen et al 2022 pointed out that the arctic has been warming nearly four times faster than the globe during 1979 2021 globally accumulated changes in wmp are mainly reflected as increase except areas between 0 and 15 n and between 45 s and 60 s there are three zones with noticeable increase in accumulated changes in wmp 15 n 30 n and 0 15 s and 15 s 45 s fig 3b in contrast to wmp wmr has mainly shown decreases in accumulated changes after 1980 the accumulated changes in wmr have shifted from increase to decrease in the south hemisphere tropics the accumulated changes in wmr have maintained the decline since 1960 in mid latitudes and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere fig 3c the zonally distribution of accumulated changes in wmp distinctly differs from that of the wmr although both show evident decreases in areas between 0 and 15 n persistent accumulated increases in wmp has not led to an increase in wmr in the tropics of the southern hemisphere and the mid and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere during the recent 20 years the globe is dominated by the persistent accumulated decreases in wmr which is consistent with the widespread warming in wmt these results imply a modulating effect of temperature on the relationship between precipitation and runoff the accumulated warming in wmt and accumulated decrease in wmr imply an increase in compound hydrological hot dry events globally 3 2 spatio temporal changes in compound hot dry extremes besides the changes in individual wmt wmp and wmr we further detect changes in occurrence probability described by probability index of compound meteorological hot dry extremes from wmt and wmp and in compound hydrological hot dry extremes from wmt and wmr the occurrence probability of meteorological hot dry extremes shows a statistically significant upward trend over 64 1 of the globe during 1902 2019 especially in africa south america europe and western u s fig 4 a hotspots for the increase of compound events have been identified over europe mid high latitudes of asia and western united states in recent decades in previous studies alizadeh et al 2020 ridder et al 2020 sarhadi et al 2018 alizadeh et al 2020 also found significantly increasing trends of compound meteorological extremes in western u s over the past 122 years overall the spatial patterns in changes of occurrence probability are similar between compound meteorological and hydrological extremes fig 4a b but areas with increased compound hydrological hot dry extremes have a wider coverage 68 1 of the globe the enhanced increases in compound hydrological hot dry extremes in comparison with compound meteorological events at 65 9 of the globe are confirmed by the rightward shift in cumulative probability distribution of trends in probability index of compound wmt and wmr relative to that in probability index of compound wmt and wmp figure not shown we also count the frequency of compound hydrological events with return period 25 50 and 75 years in the first and last half century i e 1902 1051 and 1970 2019 respectively fig 5 during 1902 1950 only three to four 25 year and one 50 year compound hydrological hot dry events are observed in 41 1 of the world while the 75 year compound events do not even occur fig 5a d and g however during 1970 2019 there is a spike in the frequency of compound extremes with the occurrence of 25 year extreme extremes 9 in 49 4 of the globe and even 12 in some regions such as central asia fig 5b e and h the difference between the two periods is most pronounced in africa south america and northern asia indicating that the compound hydrological hot dry extremes is more serious and frequent in these regions in recent half century fig 5c f and i this also corresponds to the regions with significantly increasing occurrence probability shown in fig 4 in addition to analyze the spatio temporal changes in the compound extremes it is important to assess changes in impacted area and spatial homogeneity for compound meteorological and hydrological hot dry extremes during 1902 2019 fig 6 we divide the globe into nine regions north america europe north asia east asia south asia australia africa and south america the sub regions first refer to the updated intergovernmental panel on climate change sixth assessment report ipcc ar6 climate reference land regions iturbide et al 2020 then we consolidate the ipcc ar6 climate reference land regions into 9 sub regions by continents which is consistent with previous studies herrera estrada et al 2017 sheffield et al 2009 taking compound extremes with return period 25 years as example we count the areas of grids occurring such compound extremes annually and evaluate the spatial homogeneity of these grids using moran s index alizadeh et al 2020 the closer moran s index is to 1 the more strongly compound hot dry events are spatially clustered the area affected by 25 year meteorological hot dry extremes expands in all sub regions linear regression slopes range from 42 to 139 with high values in central asia 139 however the area affected by compound hydrological extremes is larger ranging from 55 to 151 with high values in europe 151 it indicates that compound hydrological hot dry extremes have the wider coverage and deserve more attention the slopes of linear regressions for the moran s index affected by the 25 year compound meteorological hot dry extremes range from 0 04 south america to 0 19 africa spatial homogeneity of compound hydrological hot dry extremes is higher ranging from 0 05 south america to 0 34 europe the regions such as europe africa and south america with high values of area affected and large slopes of linear regressions in spatial homogeneity face more severe high temperature and water scarcity large spatially homogenous compound extremes can pose great threats on crops forestation and rapidly deplete national and local relief resources alizadeh et al 2020 3 3 drivers of changes in occurrence probability of compound hot dry extremes due to the latitudinal features in accumulated changes in wmt and wmr fig 3 we divided the globe into 4 regions based on latitudes i e 30 n 60 n 0 30 n 0 30 s and 30 s 60 s to assess the co occurrence probability of wmt and wmr at different percentiles fig 7 in each grid of a given region we calculate 10th 20th 100th percentile values of wmt and wmr during 1902 2019 bin the wmt and wmr values into the 10 10 percentile grids and count the co occurrence probability of wmt and wmr in each percentile grid there is a negative correlation between wmt and wmr in all the four regions especially in the mid latitudes of northern hemisphere pearson correlation coefficient 0 53 p 0 001 fig 7a this negative correlation is more pronounced at mid latitudes than in the tropics and more pronounced in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere fig 7a d in fig 3 consistent accumulated increases in wmt and accumulated decreases in wmr are found in the mid latitudes of northern hemisphere conforming the strong negative correlation between wmt and wmr in this region we use the probability multiplication factor pmf to assess the joint probability of compound hot dry extremes compared to when univariate variables are independent of each other the joint probability of compound meteorological extremes is approximately three times higher than for independent combinations and even five times higher in europe central eastern south america australia and the southern sahara desert fig 8 a c this emphasizes that extreme hot and dry extremes are not independent but strongly contacted the negative dependence between wmt and wmp is consistent with previous studies e g zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 specifically zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 also found a widespread negative correlation between summer mean air temperature and precipitation at the globe and high pmf values in central u s central eastern south america and australia they further pointed out an increasing likelihood of concurrent hot and dry extremes in these regions the spatial patterns of pmf for compound meteorological and hydrological hot dry extremes are broadly similar however compound hydrological hot dry extremes have higher pmf than compound meteorological extremes at 76 0 72 4 and 68 8 of the globe based on 25 year 50 year and 75 year return period respectively fig 8 this suggests that the dependence between high wmt and low wmr is stronger than that between high wmt and low wmp land atmosphere feedback plays an important role in the negative dependence between hot and dry extremes in mid high latitudes especially in europe miralles et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2019a high air temperature would lead to increases in land evapotranspiration from both soil and plants the increases in evapotranspiration would lead to reduction in soil moisture which is beneficial to increases in sensible heat the increases in sensible heat would further lead to increases in air temperature this positive feedback would lead to land desiccation atmospheric condition and precipitation suppression thereby resulting in occurrences of compound hot dry extreme events panda et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 furthermore this positive feedback would exacerbate the increase in vapor pressure deficit and then transfer more moisture from river to atmosphere by plant evapotranspiration thereby resulting compound hot dry extremes from temperature and runoff zhang et al 2022 alizadeh et al 2020 previous studies have pointed out that the mid high latitudes especially europe are the hotspots of land atmosphere feedback seo and ha 2022 schumacher et al 2022 besides the dependence between wmt and wmr we further clarify the additional effects of high wmt and low wmp on wmr fig 9 under both high wmt and low wmp conditions wmt 90th and wmp 10th fig 9a increases in wmr are found at mid and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere such as northern north america siberia and the tibetan plateau which may be related to snow and glacier melt and thawing due to increasing temperatures lutz et al 2014 qiu 2012 slater et al 2021 however the globe mainly witnesses decreases in wmr under high wmt and low wmp conditions especially in eastern north america europe east asia and south america under low wmp condition i e wmp 10th the additional effect of high temperature on wmr is negative but these negative anomalies in wmr are weak fig 9b under high wmt condition the additional effect of low precipitation on runoff is also negative however these negative anomalies in wmr are evidently stronger than that due to the additional effect of high temperature especially in global monsoon regions in east asia south asia africa and the south and north america fig 9c in these monsoon regions with abundant precipitation additional low wmp has a strong amplification effect on the decreases in wmr induced by high wmt we finally quantify the influence of three driving factors i e wmt wmr and the dependence between wmt and wmr on changes in return period of compound hydrological hot dry extremes fig 10 compared to the first period 1902 1951 the joint return period of the 25 year hot dry extremes significantly reduced in the second period 1971 2019 indicating that compound hydrological hot dry extremes with equal severity became more frequent in the latter period fig 10a c this reduction is found over 79 8 of the globe except for central north america and east asia the dependence between wmt and wmr contributes to the reduction of joint return period over 51 6 of the globe especially in south america africa and australia fig 10d and g the spatial pattern of wmr driven changes in the joint return period is complex with positive contributions to the increases of the joint return period in central north america and east asia fig 10e and h compared with the dependence 51 6 and wmr 50 6 wmt plays a dominant role 89 2 in the reduction of joint return periods and positive contributions are found across the globe fig 10f and i alizadeh et al 2020 also showed that the observed warming trend has become the dominant driver for the increasing likelihood of compound hot dry extremes over the contiguous united states in recent decades 4 conclusions in this study based on multiple global datasets of precipitation temperature and runoff during 1902 2019 we first analyze the spatio temporal dynamic evolution of the three individual variables i e warm season mean temperature wmt warm season mean precipitation wmp and warm season mean runoff wmr using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd method secondly we estimate the return period of compound hydrological hot dry extremes from wmt and wmr based on the copula function finally we evaluate the impacts of wmt and wmp on wmr and quantify the contributions of dependence between wmt and wmr wmt only and wmr only to the changes in the return period of the compound hydrological hot dry extremes between the first and last half centuries during 1902 2019 noticeable increases in accumulated changes in wmt are found globally especially in mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere however spatial patterns of accumulated changes are complex in both wmp and wmr the complex spatial patterns between wmp and wmr indicate that changes in wmr do not match changes in wmp from an aspect of zonal average changes accumulated changes in wmp are dominated by increases at the globe while wmr has increased in accumulated changes over most of the world the patterns of zonal average changes in accumulated changes of wmr are basically consistent with that of wmt which shows zonally accelerated warming trends during recent decades these results imply that the relationship between wmp and wmr may be modulated by wmt and changes in compound meteorological hot dry extremes from wmt and wmp may not be enough reflect changes in compound hydrological hot dry extremes in comparison with complex spatial patterns of accumulated changes in wmp and wmr the occurrence probability of compound meteorological and hydrological hot dry extremes shows widespread increased trends at globe during 1902 2019 more intense increases are found in occurrence probability of compound hydrological hot dry extremes than in that of compound meteorological hot dry extremes especially in africa south america europe and western u s in addition compound hydrological hot dry extremes have become more frequent expanded affected area and enlarged spatial homogeneity i e connectedness in space which could pose great threats on food production and water resource security increased compound hydrological hot dry extremes are directly related to wmt and wmp a strong negative dependence between wmt and wmr is found across the globe especially at mid latitudes in the northern hemisphere the dependence between high wmt and low wmr is even stronger than that between high wmt and low wmp although negative wmr anomalies are related to both high wmt and low wmp under conditions of high wmt these negative wmr anomalies can be evidently amplified by additional low wmp this indicates that wmr shortage is more sensitive to decreases in wmp under hot extremes nevertheless attributions show that the increased occurrence probability of compound hydrological hot dry extremes is mainly driven by increased wmt followed by the dependence between wmt and wmr credit authorship contribution statement ruiying min formal analysis investigation

1850,compound hot dry extremes pose great threats to human health ecosystems and food production a lot of attention has been paid to compound meteorological hot dry extremes based on high near surface air temperature and low precipitation however there is a gap on the compound hydrological hot dry extremes based on high near surface air temperature and low surface runoff which is more directly related to damages on social and natural systems here using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition method and copula function based on multiple global gridded datasets during 1902 2019 we find that the globe is dominated by accumulated increases in zonal average of warm season i e may september in the northern hemisphere and november march in the southern hemisphere mean precipitation wmp while zonal average of warm season mean runoff wmr mainly shows accumulated decreases this discrepancy is possibly due to the modulation effect of zonally accelerated warming trends in warm season mean temperature wmt despite of the discrepancy in changes of individual wmp and wmr compound meteorological hot dry extremes from wmt and wmp show increased occurrence probability expanded affected area and enlarged spatial homogeneity i e connectedness and these features are worse for compound hydrological extremes from wmt and wmr both high wmt and low wmp can lead to negative anomalies of wmr however the negative anomalies of wmr can be largely amplified by additional low wmp under high wmt conditions the increased occurrence probability of compound hydrological hot dry extremes is directly related to wmt wmr and their dependence although a strong dependence is found between wmt and wmr especially at mid latitudes in the northern hemisphere attribution results show that increased wmt plays a dominant role in reducing return periods of compound hydrological hot dry extremes at the global scale our results provide a deeper understanding of changes in compound hydrological hot dry extremes at the global scale from a longer term period keywords compound meteorological hot dry extremes compound hydrological hot dry extremes accumulated changes occurrence

meteorological droughts and hydrological droughts have serious impacts on human health wang et al 2022a ecosystems filipa silva ribeiro et al 2020 he et al 2022 mishra et al 2020 and social economy ridder et al 2020 due to large damages caused by these univariate extreme events their spatial and temporal dynamic evolution spatial extent moving speed and driving mechanisms have received extensive attention alizadeh et al 2020 guan et al 2022 luo et al 2022a 2022b mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 ridder et al 2020 wang et al 2022b yu et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 the occurrence probability severity and duration of univariate extreme events have shown significant increasing trends in recent decades gu et al 2019 2020 li et al 2023 mazdiyasni et al 2017 meehl and tebaldi 2004 satoh et al 2022 yu et al 2022 univariate extreme events cause incalculable damages to ecosystems and economy however damages caused by compound extreme events are often more severe sarhadi et al 2018 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 generally meteorological hot dry events usually indicated high temperatures and precipitation shortages while hydrological events focus on high temperatures and runoff deficit eze et al 2022 peterson et al 2021 ridder et al 2020 although hydrological hot dry events are more directly related to water scarcity and human productivity in comparison with meteorological hot dry events byers et al 2020 gómez gener et al 2020 tiwari et al 2022 changes in compound hot dry events from temperature and runoff at global scale are poorly understood the characteristics and drivers of changes in meteorological hot dry events at global and regional scales have been extensively studied mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 sarhadi et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 showed that the frequency of compound dry and hot extremes has increased substantially in the past few decades over the contiguous united states globally anthropogenic climate change has doubled the joint occurrence probability of years that are both hot and dry sarhadi et al 2018 meteorological hot dry events become more frequent more severe with longer duration implying that hydrological hot dry events could occur more commonly however hydrological hot dry events are also affected by land surface processes such as land evapotranspiration liu et al 2021 markonis et al 2021 deforestation of tropical rainforests chagas et al 2022 melting permafrost qiu 2012 therefore it is necessary to directly investigate changes in compound hydrological hot dry events at the global scale changes in compound events are directly driven by their univariate extreme events li et al 2022 wu et al 2021 for example changes in occurrence probability of compound meteorological hot dry events are directly linked to changes in the probability of extreme high temperature and extreme low precipitation as well as in the dependence between high temperature and low precipitation bevacqua et al 2019 alizadeh et al 2020 attributed the increased likelihood of compound meteorological hot dry extremes over the contiguous united states during the past 122 years to the observed warming trend bevacqua et al 2022 indicated that the future occurrence of global compound meteorological hot dry extremes will be modulated by mean precipitation trends these previous studies mainly focused on compound meteorological hot dry extremes however contributions of high temperature low runoff and their dependence to changes in occurrence probability of compound hydrological hot dry extremes are not quantified therefore in this study we aim to achieve the following three objectives 1 evaluating the spatial and temporal dynamics of global near surface air temperature precipitation and surface runoff 2 quantifying joint occurrence probability of compound hot dry extremes and 3 attributing changes in joint occurrence probability of compound hot dry extremes to two associated univariates and their dependence 2 data and methods 2 1 data two monthly gridded near surface air temperature datasets are obtained from the center for climatic research ccr university of delaware ud willmott and matsuura 2001 and from the climate research unit cru mitchell and jones 2005 respectively four monthly gridded precipitation datasets are provided by ccr ud cru the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc schneider et al 2011 and the gridded land surface extremes indices hadex3 created by the met office hadley centre dunn et al 2020 both the temperature and precipitation datasets are produced based on observations and more details on these datasets can be seen in table 1 the g run ensemble dataset is a monthly global surface runoff product at 0 5 spatial resolution during 1901 2019 firstly accounting for the uncertainty in historical hydrometeorological conditions ghiggi et al 2021 it is derived from a machine learning algorithm using an ensemble of 21 gridded atmospheric forcing datasets david et al 2022 the quality of g run runoff values was evaluated using a database of river discharge observations from large river basins and benchmarked against a comprehensive collection of publicly available global monthly runoff reconstructions during 1981 2010 ghiggi et al 2021 this runoff dataset has a wide range of applications including marine science xu et al 2022 terrestrial water storage lee et al 2022 and streamflow volumes masseroni et al 2021 due to the discrepancy in spatial resolution of these gridded datasets we aggregated them into a common 2 5 2 5 resolution using the second order conservative remapping method padrón et al 2020 considering the difference in magnitude of temperature precipitation between the two among the four datasets we first extracted the monthly anomalies by removing the mean of the corresponding month during the reference period 1981 2010 for example values in january minus the mean of all 30 values in january during the reference period and then calculated the multi dataset ensemble mean in the same way we also extracted the anomalies in runoff warm season i e may september in the northern hemisphere and november march in the southern hemisphere mean temperature wmt precipitation wmp and runoff wmr anomalies are used to define the compound hot dry extremes we limited our study regions between 60 n and 60 s data are almost not available in areas beyond these regions and masked the areas with annual total precipitation below 100 mm these areas are dominated by deserts the common period 1902 2019 of these datasets is taken as the study period 2 2 ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd in eemd a time series at a grid point x t e g wmt wmp or wmr in this study is decomposed as adaptively obtained amplitude frequency modulated oscillatory components known as intrinsic mode functions imf the sequential elimination of imfs c j j 1 2 n produces a residual r n a curve either monotonic or containing only one extremum from which no additional oscillatory components can be extracted chen et al 2020 ji et al 2014 sullivan et al 2021 vinnarasi et al 2017 1 x t j 1 n c j t r n t the extracted dynamic trend r n does not follow a priori shape this trend is also less sensitive to the boundary compared to the other commonly used methods hence the physical meaning of the time series will be retained even after appendage of data vinnarasi et al 2017 eemd has been widely applied in climate research chen et al 2020 stallone et al 2020 sullivan et al 2021 sun et al 2022 vinnarasi et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 here we diagnose the accumulated increment of the eemd trend at a given time from the reference time of 1902 representing accumulated change of wmt wmp or wmr from 1902 ji et al 2014 vinnarasi et al 2017 2 trend eemd t r n t r n 1902 as the trend i e trend eemd t is time varying the corresponding instantaneous rates which can be estimated by calculating temporal derivatives of trends are also temporally and spatially local quantities ji et al 2014 3 r a t e t trend eemd t 1 trend eemd t 1 2 2 3 joint occurrence probability and return period the copula function is used to describe the correlation between two even more variables and to derive their joint distribution feng et al 2020 qing et al 2022 it is an elegant and effective method for the proper multivariate investigation of joint occurrence probability vezzoli et al 2017 it is first proposed in statistics and now widely used in hydrological and meteorological studies feng et al 2020 hatami and nazemi 2022 mazdiyasni et al 2019 sadeghfam et al 2022 simanjuntak et al 2022 vezzoli et al 2017 in copula function x y are continuous random variables with distribution functions f and g respectively h is a function with marginal univariate distributions to describe their joint distribution all above can be expressed as alizadeh et al 2020 4 f x p x x g y p y y 5 h x y p x x y y then there is a copula c alizadeh et al 2020 6 h x y c f x g y here x y refer to wmt and wmp wmt and wmr respectively in this study the joint occurrence probability of compound hot dry extremes is zhou et al 2019b 7 p x x a n d y y g y c f x g y then their associated return period t and probability index pi are estimated as yue and rasmussen 2002 8 t 1 p x x a n d y y 1 g y c f x g y 9 p i 1 p x x a n d y y 1 g y c f x g y the return period such as t 50 indicates compound hot dry extremes on average occur in once in 50 years the probability index pi indicates the non exceeding probability of the compound hot dry extremes within the range of 0 1 lager pi value corresponds higher t we choose nonparametric methods to calculate univariate probabilities this relaxes the need for fitting parametric distributions to data these parametric distributions are associated with underlying assumptions and violation of the assumptions produces biased and unreliable results alizadeh et al 2020 the commonly used bivariate copula families include elliptical and archimedean copulas copulas are selected via akaike information criterion aic from the families gaussian t clayton gumbel frank joe bb1 bb6 bb7 and bb8 in the r package vinecopula function bicopselect https cran r project org web packages copula index html bevacqua et al 2019 zhou et al 2019b only frank is adopted at global grid cells to exclude the influence of different joint functions on the results probability multiplication factor pmf can quantify the strength of dependence between the two variables ridder et al 2020 zhou et al 2019b for example if the wmt is 10 years high temperature extremes and the wmp wmr is 10 years low precipitation runoff extremes the pmf of such compound high temperature and low precipitation runoff extremes are estimated as ridder et al 2020 zhou et al 2019b 10 p f x 0 9 a n d g y 0 1 0 1 c 0 9 0 1 p m f 0 1 c 0 9 0 1 0 1 0 1 when pmf 1 it means that hot and dry extremes are independent of each other when pmf 1 the larger pmf is the stronger the dependence between the two variables i e hot and dry extremes have strong dependence in this study 2 4 attribution of changes in return period of compound extremes changes in return periods such as in a given 25 year of compound hot dry extremes between two stages i e the first and last semi centuries 1902 1951 and 1970 2019 is denoted as bevacqua et al 2019 lai et al 2021 11 δ t t stage 2 t stage 1 t stage 1 100 where t stage 1 and t stage 2 are given as bevacqua et al 2019 lai et al 2021 12 t stage 1 1 g y stage 1 c stage 1 f x stage 1 g y stage 1 13 t stage 2 1 g y stage 2 c stage 2 f x stage 2 g y stage 2 as previous studies using season mean air temperature and precipitation to define compound hot dry extremes sarhadi et al 2018 alizadeh et al 2020 chiang et al 2022 we in this study define compound hot dry extremes as years with joint return periods of wmt and wmp wmr longer than 25 50 75 years for the compound wmt and wmp wmr its physical meaning is that the regions simultaneously experience severely warm conditions in conjunction with dry years i e low precipitation runoff sarhadi et al 2018 alizadeh et al 2020 chiang et al 2022 the change in return periods of compound hydrological hot dry events is driven by wmt wmr and the dependence between wmt and wmr there experiments are conduced to quantify contributions of the three drivers to changes in return periods of compound hydrological hot dry extremes i e δ t in eq 11 bevacqua et al 2019 lai et al 2021 a only considering the change in dependence between wmt and wmr eq 14 b only considering the wmt overall marginal distributions i e the wmt distribution without reference to wmr eq 15

driven or wmr driven changes in return periods of compound hydrological hot dry extremes between two periods note that the total return period change eq 17 is not given by the sum of these three experiences a b and c as the overall dependencies and marginal distributions do not contribute linearly to the joint return periods the relative contributions of the three drivers i e wmt wmr and the dependence between wmt and wmr to changes in return periods of compound hydrological hot dry extremes between two periods are estimated as bevacqua et al 2019 lai et al 2021 18 δ t exp i r e l a t i v e 100 δ t exp i i 1 3 δ t exp i 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatio temporal evolution in individual wmt wmp and wmr the spatial distribution of accumulated changes since 1902 in wmt wmp and wmr is shown in fig 1 prior to 1960 noticeable accumulated warming in wmt 1 5 c was sporadically distributed between 30 n and 60 n such as in europe fig 1a c the early sporadic warming has been expanding since 1960 s fig 1c e by 2019 evident accumulated warming 1 5 c extended to almost all mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere fig 1e allan et al 2021 ji et al 2014 accumulated changes in wmp show a complex pattern globally fig 1f j prior to 1980 accumulated wmp decreased especially in north america and australia fig 1f g then it shifted to increase over the next four decades after 1980 accumulated wmp in africa shifted from decrease to increase however wmp always has been shown as a strong accumulated decrease in the tibetan plateau over the past 118 years accumulated changes in wmp have a complex pattern in south america fig 1h g similar to wmp accumulated changes in wmr also show a complex spatial pattern globally fig 1k o noticeable decrease in wmr 4 mm was sporadic before 1980 mainly in south america and africa fig 1k m but since 2000 the areas showing decreasing wmr have gradually expanded and faced increasing hydrological drought fig 1n o satoh et al 2022 consistent with accumulated changes in wmp wmr has been declining for a century in europe and the tibetan plateau in north america decreasing changes in wmr have been continuously mitigated in north america wmr has been decreased in northeast asia in contrast to the increase in accumulated changes in wmp the spatial patterns of accumulated changes of wmt wmp and wmr are broadly consistent with those of instantaneous rates figs 1 2 in 1960 warming rate in wmt was relatively weak in almost all regions of the globe except europe in subsequent decades cooler regions shrank and warming 1 6 mm decade sharply expanded also see ji et al 2014 suggesting that the accumulated increase in temperature over recent decades will exceed the warming of the early 20th century fig 2a e the change rates in wmp and wmr are relatively similar both showing complex patterns globally fig 2f o wmp in north america has increased at a very high rate 1 4 mm decade especially since 1980 on the other hand wmp in vast areas of asia and europe has changed at a weak rate fig 2f g except for the obvious decline rate of wmr in africa and south america the change rate in wmr is relatively weak globally the accumulated change in wmp and wmr shifted from an initial increase to a later decrease in south america africa and northeast asia fig 1 which was supported by noticeable drying rates 1 2 mm decade in these regions fig 2 overall the spatial match of dynamics of wmp and wmr is complex in not only accumulated changes but also instantaneous rates for example increased accumulated wmp in north america and southern east asia can supply more water for wmr and then is conductive to increased accumulated wmr however increased accumulated wmp in northeastern east asia seems not work on the decreased accumulated wmr in this region possibly due to increased evapotranspiration induced by increased wmt for europe and north africa with complex changes in accumulated wmp the noticeable decreases in accumulated changes in wmr are closer to faster warming in the two regions these results imply that spatial patterns of changes in compound meteorological hot dry extremes may not be enough to reveal that in compound hydrological hot dry extremes zonally average accumulated changes in wmt wmp and wmr are shown in fig 3 there is a tongue structure to the zonally warming trend with noticeable warming 1 c firstly occurring in the mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere followed by the subtropical regions of the southern hemisphere fig 3a ji et al 2014 the fastest warming in mid high latitudes was also found in previous studies wu et al 2011 huang et al 2012 ji et al 2014 for example ji et al 2014 found that annual mean near surface air temperature in northern mid latitudes warms the fastest in recent decades huang et al 2012 reported that the arid and semiarid regions of the mid latitude northern hemisphere have the greatest warming possibly due to the small heat capacity of these regions on the other hand this fastest warming in mid high latitudes is associated with the amplified arctic warming francis et al 2017 rantanen et al 2022 rantanen et al 2022 pointed out that the arctic has been warming nearly four times faster than the globe during 1979 2021 globally accumulated changes in wmp are mainly reflected as increase except areas between 0 and 15 n and between 45 s and 60 s there are three zones with noticeable increase in accumulated changes in wmp 15 n 30 n and 0 15 s and 15 s 45 s fig 3b in contrast to wmp wmr has mainly shown decreases in accumulated changes after 1980 the accumulated changes in wmr have shifted from increase to decrease in the south hemisphere tropics the accumulated changes in wmr have maintained the decline since 1960 in mid latitudes and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere fig 3c the zonally distribution of accumulated changes in wmp distinctly differs from that of the wmr although both show evident decreases in areas between 0 and 15 n persistent accumulated increases in wmp has not led to an increase in wmr in the tropics of the southern hemisphere and the mid and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere during the recent 20 years the globe is dominated by the persistent accumulated decreases in wmr which is consistent with the widespread warming in wmt these results imply a modulating effect of temperature on the relationship between precipitation and runoff the accumulated warming in wmt and accumulated decrease in wmr imply an increase in compound hydrological hot dry events globally 3 2 spatio temporal changes in compound hot dry extremes besides the changes in individual wmt wmp and wmr we further detect changes in occurrence probability described by probability index of compound meteorological hot dry extremes from wmt and wmp and in compound hydrological hot dry extremes from wmt and wmr the occurrence probability of meteorological hot dry extremes shows a statistically significant upward trend over 64 1 of the globe during 1902 2019 especially in africa south america europe and western u s fig 4 a hotspots for the increase of compound events have been identified over europe mid high latitudes of asia and western united states in recent decades in previous studies alizadeh et al 2020 ridder et al 2020 sarhadi et al 2018 alizadeh et al 2020 also found significantly increasing trends of compound meteorological extremes in western u s over the past 122 years overall the spatial patterns in changes of occurrence probability are similar between compound meteorological and hydrological extremes fig 4a b but areas with increased compound hydrological hot dry extremes have a wider coverage 68 1 of the globe the enhanced increases in compound hydrological hot dry extremes in comparison with compound meteorological events at 65 9 of the globe are confirmed by the rightward shift in cumulative probability distribution of trends in probability index of compound wmt and wmr relative to that in probability index of compound wmt and wmp figure not shown we also count the frequency of compound hydrological events with return period 25 50 and 75 years in the first and last half century i e 1902 1051 and 1970 2019 respectively fig 5 during 1902 1950 only three to four 25 year and one 50 year compound hydrological hot dry events are observed in 41 1 of the world while the 75 year compound events do not even occur fig 5a d and g however during 1970 2019 there is a spike in the frequency of compound extremes with the occurrence of 25 year extreme extremes 9 in 49 4 of the globe and even 12 in some regions such as central asia fig 5b e and h the difference between the two periods is most pronounced in africa south america and northern asia indicating that the compound hydrological hot dry extremes is more serious and frequent in these regions in recent half century fig 5c f and i this also corresponds to the regions with significantly increasing occurrence probability shown in fig 4 in addition to analyze the spatio temporal changes in the compound extremes it is important to assess changes in impacted area and spatial homogeneity for compound meteorological and hydrological hot dry extremes during 1902 2019 fig 6 we divide the globe into nine regions north america europe north asia east asia south asia australia africa and south america the sub regions first refer to the updated intergovernmental panel on climate change sixth assessment report ipcc ar6 climate reference land regions iturbide et al 2020 then we consolidate the ipcc ar6 climate reference land regions into 9 sub regions by continents which is consistent with previous studies herrera estrada et al 2017 sheffield et al 2009 taking compound extremes with return period 25 years as example we count the areas of grids occurring such compound extremes annually and evaluate the spatial homogeneity of these grids using moran s index alizadeh et al 2020 the closer moran s index is to 1 the more strongly compound hot dry events are spatially clustered the area affected by 25 year meteorological hot dry extremes expands in all sub regions linear regression slopes range from 42 to 139 with high values in central asia 139 however the area affected by compound hydrological extremes is larger ranging from 55 to 151 with high values in europe 151 it indicates that compound hydrological hot dry extremes have the wider coverage and deserve more attention the slopes of linear regressions for the moran s index affected by the 25 year compound meteorological hot dry extremes range from 0 04 south america to 0 19 africa spatial homogeneity of compound hydrological hot dry extremes is higher ranging from 0 05 south america to 0 34 europe the regions such as europe africa and south america with high values of area affected and large slopes of linear regressions in spatial homogeneity face more severe high temperature and water scarcity large spatially homogenous compound extremes can pose great threats on crops forestation and rapidly deplete national and local relief resources alizadeh et al 2020 3 3 drivers of changes in occurrence probability of compound hot dry extremes due to the latitudinal features in accumulated changes in wmt and wmr fig 3 we divided the globe into 4 regions based on latitudes i e 30 n 60 n 0 30 n 0 30 s and 30 s 60 s to assess the co occurrence probability of wmt and wmr at different percentiles fig 7 in each grid of a given region we calculate 10th 20th 100th percentile values of wmt and wmr during 1902 2019 bin the wmt and wmr values into the 10 10 percentile grids and count the co occurrence probability of wmt and wmr in each percentile grid there is a negative correlation between wmt and wmr in all the four regions especially in the mid latitudes of northern hemisphere pearson correlation coefficient 0 53 p 0 001 fig 7a this negative correlation is more pronounced at mid latitudes than in the tropics and more pronounced in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere fig 7a d in fig 3 consistent accumulated increases in wmt and accumulated decreases in wmr are found in the mid latitudes of northern hemisphere conforming the strong negative correlation between wmt and wmr in this region we use the probability multiplication factor pmf to assess the joint probability of compound hot dry extremes compared to when univariate variables are independent of each other the joint probability of compound meteorological extremes is approximately three times higher than for independent combinations and even five times higher in europe central eastern south america australia and the southern sahara desert fig 8 a c this emphasizes that extreme hot and dry extremes are not independent but strongly contacted the negative dependence between wmt and wmp is consistent with previous studies e g zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 specifically zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 also found a widespread negative correlation between summer mean air temperature and precipitation at the globe and high pmf values in central u s central eastern south america and australia they further pointed out an increasing likelihood of concurrent hot and dry extremes in these regions the spatial patterns of pmf for compound meteorological and hydrological hot dry extremes are broadly similar however compound hydrological hot dry extremes have higher pmf than compound meteorological extremes at 76 0 72 4 and 68 8 of the globe based on 25 year 50 year and 75 year return period respectively fig 8 this suggests that the dependence between high wmt and low wmr is stronger than that between high wmt and low wmp land atmosphere feedback plays an important role in the negative dependence between hot and dry extremes in mid high latitudes especially in europe miralles et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2019a high air temperature would lead to increases in land evapotranspiration from both soil and plants the increases in evapotranspiration would lead to reduction in soil moisture which is beneficial to increases in sensible heat the increases in sensible heat would further lead to increases in air temperature this positive feedback would lead to land desiccation atmospheric condition and precipitation suppression thereby resulting in occurrences of compound hot dry extreme events panda et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 furthermore this positive feedback would exacerbate the increase in vapor pressure deficit and then transfer more moisture from river to atmosphere by plant evapotranspiration thereby resulting compound hot dry extremes from temperature and runoff zhang et al 2022 alizadeh et al 2020 previous studies have pointed out that the mid high latitudes especially europe are the hotspots of land atmosphere feedback seo and ha 2022 schumacher et al 2022 besides the dependence between wmt and wmr we further clarify the additional effects of high wmt and low wmp on wmr fig 9 under both high wmt and low wmp conditions wmt 90th and wmp 10th fig 9a increases in wmr are found at mid and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere such as northern north america siberia and the tibetan plateau which may be related to snow and glacier melt and thawing due to increasing temperatures lutz et al 2014 qiu 2012 slater et al 2021 however the globe mainly witnesses decreases in wmr under high wmt and low wmp conditions especially in eastern north america europe east asia and south america under low wmp condition i e wmp 10th the additional effect of high temperature on wmr is negative but these negative anomalies in wmr are weak fig 9b under high wmt condition the additional effect of low precipitation on runoff is also negative however these negative anomalies in wmr are evidently stronger than that due to the additional effect of high temperature especially in global monsoon regions in east asia south asia africa and the south and north america fig 9c in these monsoon regions with abundant precipitation additional low wmp has a strong amplification effect on the decreases in wmr induced by high wmt we finally quantify the influence of three driving factors i e wmt wmr and the dependence between wmt and wmr on changes in return period of compound hydrological hot dry extremes fig 10 compared to the first period 1902 1951 the joint return period of the 25 year hot dry extremes significantly reduced in the second period 1971 2019 indicating that compound hydrological hot dry extremes with equal severity became more frequent in the latter period fig 10a c this reduction is found over 79 8 of the globe except for central north america and east asia the dependence between wmt and wmr contributes to the reduction of joint return period over 51 6 of the globe especially in south america africa and australia fig 10d and g the spatial pattern of wmr driven changes in the joint return period is complex with positive contributions to the increases of the joint return period in central north america and east asia fig 10e and h compared with the dependence 51 6 and wmr 50 6 wmt plays a dominant role 89 2 in the reduction of joint return periods and positive contributions are found across the globe fig 10f and i alizadeh et al 2020 also showed that the observed warming trend has become the dominant driver for the increasing likelihood of compound hot dry extremes over the contiguous united states in recent decades 4 conclusions in this study based on multiple global datasets of precipitation temperature and runoff during 1902 2019 we first analyze the spatio temporal dynamic evolution of the three individual variables i e warm season mean temperature wmt warm season mean precipitation wmp and warm season mean runoff wmr using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd method secondly we estimate the return period of compound hydrological hot dry extremes from wmt and wmr based on the copula function finally we evaluate the impacts of wmt and wmp on wmr and quantify the contributions of dependence between wmt and wmr wmt only and wmr only to the changes in the return period of the compound hydrological hot dry extremes between the first and last half centuries during 1902 2019 noticeable increases in accumulated changes in wmt are found globally especially in mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere however spatial patterns of accumulated changes are complex in both wmp and wmr the complex spatial patterns between wmp and wmr indicate that changes in wmr do not match changes in wmp from an aspect of zonal average changes accumulated changes in wmp are dominated by increases at the globe while wmr has increased in accumulated changes over most of the world the patterns of zonal average changes in accumulated changes of wmr are basically consistent with that of wmt which shows zonally accelerated warming trends during recent decades these results imply that the relationship between wmp and wmr may be modulated by wmt and changes in compound meteorological hot dry extremes from wmt and wmp may not be enough reflect changes in compound hydrological hot dry extremes in comparison with complex spatial patterns of accumulated changes in wmp and wmr the occurrence probability of compound meteorological and hydrological hot dry extremes shows widespread increased trends at globe during 1902 2019 more intense increases are found in occurrence probability of compound hydrological hot dry extremes than in that of compound meteorological hot dry extremes especially in africa south america europe and western u s in addition compound hydrological hot dry extremes have become more frequent expanded affected area and enlarged spatial homogeneity i e connectedness in space which could pose great threats on food production and water resource security increased compound hydrological hot dry extremes are directly related to wmt and wmp a strong negative dependence between wmt and wmr is found across the globe especially at mid latitudes in the northern hemisphere the dependence between high wmt and low wmr is even stronger than that between high wmt and low wmp although negative wmr anomalies are related to both high wmt and low wmp under conditions of high wmt these negative wmr anomalies can be evidently amplified by additional low wmp this indicates that wmr shortage is more sensitive to decreases in wmp under hot extremes nevertheless attributions show that the increased occurrence probability of compound hydrological hot dry extremes is mainly driven by increased wmt followed by the dependence between wmt and wmr credit authorship contribution statement ruiying min formal analysis investigation

1851,multiple subsystems such as water food land carbon ecology and nutrition are closely intertwined and the resulting complexity and uncertainty pose challenges to water resource management this study proposes an optimization framework from a novel water food carbon land ecology nutrition wonder nexus perspective for the integrated management of agricultural and ecological water resources firstly the irrigation priority ranking of decision making units dmu is obtained based on the remote sensing indices from the google earth engine gee platform secondly the ecological satisfaction degree which aggregates carbon sink satisfaction degree and ecological water demand satisfaction degree is proposed to characterize the degree of achieving the pre given ecological objectives then the above two indicators i e the irrigation priority ranking and the ecological satisfaction degree are integrated with a fuzzy interval credibility constrained bi level multi objective programming model to realize 1 reconciling conflicts in food nutrition food security economic development and ecological conservation 2 making trade offs among the positions and preferences of different decision makers 3 dealing with the dual uncertainties of fuzzy interval parameters 4 obtaining optimal agricultural and ecological water allocation schemes the applicability of the model is verified by taking hongyashan irrigation district of minqin county as an example the results show that 1 the irrigation priority ranking for the dmus is dmu 10 dmu 9 dmu 4 dmu 5 dmu 1 dmu 11 dmu 6 dmu 8 dmu 7 dmu 2 dmu 3 2 the ratio of agricultural to ecological water allocation in the irrigation district is about 3 1 which is consistent with the water use characteristics of this area 3 the total water allocation during the whole growth period for different crops is mainly determined by planting area and the ranking of the water allocation is sunflower maize wheat seed melon moreover compared with the single level models the inexact bi level multi objective model can well coordinate the upper and lower decision makers and the multiple decision objectives under the wonder nexus therefore the proposed framework can provide the scientific basis for balancing agricultural and ecological water management and conflicting objectives in similar irrigation districts through involving multiple subsystems and perspectives keywords water food carbon land ecology nutrition nexus gee irrigation priority fuzzy interval sets bi level multi objective programming optimal water resources allocation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in arid agricultural areas agriculture is not only the largest water consuming sector but also the main factor leading to increasing environmental pollution moreover they are facing water shortages and serious ecological problems pan et al 2022 meanwhile nutritional security has become one of the primary challenges addressed since the 21st century according to report the state of food security and nutrition in the world in 2022 there are 702 to 828 million people worldwide suffering from hunger in 2021 and the number of people affected by hunger has increased by 150 million since 2019 before the covid 19 pandemic fao et al 2022 high costs and low affordability prevent billions of people from eating healthy or nutritious food in addition excessive carbon emissions threaten global ecological security thus carbon peaking and carbon neutrality have been critical tasks in china moreover the farmland ecosystem is the most active carbon pool in terrestrial ecosystems and it s most affected by human activities therefore how to manage the limited water resources in arid areas to ensure food security ecological security and the achievement of dual carbon goals and enhance the sustainability of agricultural systems are challenging issues in arid agricultural areas many factors influence optimal water resource allocation and the interrelationship among these subsystems needs to be qualified systematically and comprehensively failing to consider interdependencies can lead to the mismanagement of critical resources and threaten socioeconomic development and environmental sustainability sarkodie and owusu 2020 the nexus approach allows optimizing water allocation strategy integrating the interaction of different factors for example li et al 2019 developed an integrated intuitionistic fuzzy multi objective nonlinear model to manage the water food energy system ma et al 2020 proposed a bi level chance constrained programming model for water management under water food ecology nexus system yue et al 2021 constructed a me measure fuzzy chance constrained mixed integer multi objective non linear programming model from a novel water food energy climate change land nexus perspective maraseni et al 2021 developed an integrated regional water food energy nexus optimization model to investigate the effects of optimizing land and water resource use on agricultural production profitability and ghg emissions in an irrigated agricultural production system yao et al 2021 presented an optimization model to optimize the allocation of limited resources and maximize irrigation water productivity in water food land nexus system ren et al 2022 proposed a water energy food carbon nexus system for optimization aiming to increase irrigation water productivity reduce carbon emissions and enhance regional agriculture competitiveness guo et al 2022 formulated a distributed multi objective model based on the water food energy nexus with food production security as constraint many studies have considered food factors and carbon factors in nexus but the food factors considered in nexus mainly referred to food production and few studies on food nutrition in nexus have been undertaken nevertheless the above studies are less likely to simultaneously include food production food nutrition ecological and carbon factors within the study system therefore this study proposed the water food carbon land ecology nutrition wonder nexus which integrated multiple subsystems including water resources food carbon farmland ecology subsystem and nutrition with the connection of water quantity it s noted that water allocation under this nexus should pay attention to the following three aspects in arid agricultural areas water allocation in arid agricultural areas should consider ecological security on the one hand ecological stability is more dependent on the amount of water resources in ecologically fragile areas kuriqi et al 2020 meeting the ecological water demand is a necessary condition for realizing sustainable agriculture and it s beneficial to prevent land degradation and desertification thereby protecting the ecology from being destroyed and maintaining the integrity and ecological balance of the watershed ecological water demand satisfaction degree is a quantitative indicator to measure the degree of achievement of ecological conservation objectives for the rational allocation of water resources on the other hand carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals were launched to alleviate global warming the farmland ecosystem has the dual properties of carbon source and carbon sink and thus can contribute to the dual carbon goals achieving it is worth noting that agricultural vegetation can fix carbon in the atmosphere through photosynthesis if the resulting carbon sink can be disposed of properly it will be helpful in carbon reduction she et al 2017 xiong et al 2017 he et al 2022 the concept of carbon sink satisfaction degree was initiated to characterize the degree of achievement of carbon sink targets greater carbon sink satisfaction degree represents more carbon sink of crops in fact the ecological subsystem and the carbon subsystem are closely linked and intertwined therefore in this study the index of ecological satisfaction degree is constructed through combining the above indicators to depict the interaction between the two subsystems optimizing water allocation in arid agricultural areas requires identifying the importance of water users to maximize the value of limited water resources since they may not be sufficient for all crops at this point managers need to decide which areas have higher priority to be irrigated or allocated more water previous studies have found that prioritizing different regions in water resource management can effectively address this dilemma luo et al 2021 generally speaking it is vital to concern about ecological factors in water allocation and managers tend to set aside more water for areas with poorer ecological conditions to achieve the goal of maintaining ecological stability remote sensing based ecological index rsei is an index that can quickly detect and evaluate the ecological quality of a region xu 2013 and a higher value means the better ecological quality of the region getting rsei needs remote sensing data on calculation however the traditional remote sensing processing method involves users querying remote sensing data downloading remote sensing data and then using professional software to perform further arithmetic or visualization there are limitations such as the slow download speed the large download data volume and the complicated processing operation the emergence of google earth engine gee effectively solves these problems the remote sensing data of decision making units dmus in the irrigation district can be obtained quickly and easily in the gee therefore by extracting the rsei of dmus from gee the irrigation priority ranking of dmus is calculated water resource allocation should weigh the positions and multiple preferences of different decision makers and deal with uncertainties there are two basic groups of decision makers in a typical agricultural production system namely farmers and regional managers ahmad et al 2018 cai et al 2018 farmers are direct producers who aim to obtain additional benefits and products while regional managers have to organize agricultural water resources from a more macroscopic perspective in addition each group of decision makers may have multiple conflicting objectives which further complicates the decision making process due to the effectiveness of the bi level multi objective programming bmp model for two multi objective decision levels bmp is introduced into decision making weighing multiple objectives of farmers and regional managers zhang et al 2019 meanwhile uncertain information often appears in the process of water resources management such as water supply water demand of crops and vegetation crop prices and production costs marques et al 2005 guo et al 2019 and a reasonable analysis of uncertain information can provide a more effective solution for water resources allocation zhang and guo 2017 fuzzy credibility constrained programming can deal with violation constraints satisfied at predetermined credibility levels in a fuzzy environment optimal solutions and decisions can be made at different pre determined credibility levels for supporting decision making zhang et al 2022 in the real world a single uncertainty is difficult to handle complex parameters fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming based on fuzzy interval sets can solve the problem of violated constraint under dual uncertainty pan et al 2022 for example zhang et al 2018 used fuzzy interval sets to represent the uncertainty of water supply and precipitation and employed the fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming to optimize the monthly crop water allocation yue et al 2020a optimized the water allocation schemes and system benefits and fuzzy interval sets were introduced to describe the available water and crop water demand therefore this study aims to balance the prevalent leader follower relationship and multi objective conflicts based on incorporation of bmp and fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming for optimal allocation of agricultural and ecological water under wonder nexus and uncertainties in summary this study proposes a wonder nexus to reflect the complex response relationships of agricultural systems to resource allocation in this perspective a bi level multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained modeling approach is developed to manage water resources and handle multiple preferences of different decision makers and uncertainties specifically an ecological satisfaction degree index and an innovative irrigation priority method are set up and the violation constraints under the dual uncertainty are considered the model framework is then demonstrated by the application in the hongyashan irrigation district of minqin county in the lower reaches of shiyang river basin the optimized results under different credibility levels can provide reasonable schemes and scientific basis for balancing agricultural and ecological water management in the irrigation district the framework of the study is shown in fig 1 2 methodology 2 1 division of dmus and extraction of remote sensing data the division of dmus is determined mainly according to the irrigation district management layout and the structure of canal systems based on gee the persiann cdr dataset the mod16a2 version 6 evapotranspiration latent heat flux dataset and the mcd12q1 v6 dataset are adopted then the results of the divided dmus are uploaded to gee and remote sensing data of precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet and crop planting area of different dmus are extracted the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 is widely used as et0 calculated by penman monteith eq p m is highly accurate tang et al 2019 however due to the limitation of meteorological stations for data collection et0 obtained by traditional methods cannot represent the difference of crop evapotranspiration in complex surface land conditions using pet data by rs to represent the et0 can reflect the temporal and spatial variability but the actual crop evapotranspiration is often overestimated for errors values in pet data it is a better way to fit and correct et0 data obtained from several meteorological stations with the pet data which can not only extend the traditional et0 to the spatial scale but also ensure the accuracy of actual crop evapotranspiration pan et al 2022 therefore this study will use the fitting equation proposed by pan et al 2022 for the same study area the maximum evapotranspiration etmax refers to the crop water demand at full irrigation which is determined by referring to the single crop coefficient method et max k c et 0 as recommended by fao 56 1 e t max k c e t 0 k c 0 9075 p e t 20 411 where kc refers to crop coefficient 2 2 calculation of rsei and ei rsei combines four evaluation indicators vegetation index moisture component surface temperature and soil index which represents four major ecological elements as greenness moisture heat and dryness respectively its remote sensing definition is shown in eq 2 by integrating the four evaluation indicators with the principal component analysis pca the influence of each indicator on the rsei is determined by the nature of the data itself rather than by subjective weighting therefore the integration approach of pca is more objective and reasonable 2 rsei f g r e e n n e s s w e t n e s s h e a t d r y n e s s f n d v i w e t l s t n d s i where ndvi is the normalized vegetation index wet is the humidity index lst is the surface temperature ndsi presents the index of dryness integrated from the bare soil index si and the built up index ibi ndsi s i i b i 2 the landsat 8 level 2 collection 2 tier 1 dataset and the mod11a2 v6 datasets are used to calculate the four indicators of wet ndvi ndsi and lst respectively and then rsei is obtained by normalization and pca afterwards ei is obtained by using the expression ei 1 resi rsei is the indicator of the ecological environment condition and the larger the rsei the better the ecological environment while the larger the ei the worse the ecological environment therefore dmus with worse ecological environment have lager values of ei and higher weights by using the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis method which means higher priority to be irrigated or allocated more water all the above processes are completed on gee platform 2 3 calculation of priority level of dmus the ei of each dmu in different years calculated in section 2 2 is used as evaluation indexes and topsis method is adopted to prioritize the water allocation for different dmus the specific steps for the priority ranking of dmus are presented as follows luo et al 2021 step 1 standardize ei of different dmus and construct the evaluation matrix the processing method for the larger the better indicator is shown in eq 3 for the smaller the better indicator is shown in eq 4 and the processed standardized matrix is shown in eq 5 3 r ij v ij min v ij max v ij min v ij 4 r ij max v ij v ij max v ij min v ij 5 r r 11 r 12 r 1 n r 21 r 22 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r mn where rij refers to the standardized value of the evaluation indicator in year j of dmu i v ij denotes the initial value of the evaluation indicator in year j of dmu i r is the standardized evaluation matrix i represents the index of dmu j represents the index of year step 2 solve the positive and negative ideal solutions let y be the maximum value of year j in dmu i which is called the positive ideal solution and y be the minimum value of the year j in dmu i which is called the negative ideal solution 6 y max 1 j n r ij j 1 2 n y 1 y 2 y n 7 y max 1 j n r ij j 1 2 n y 1 y 2 y n step 3 calculate the distance by euclidean distance formula 8 d i j 1 n y j y ij 2 9 d i j 1 n y j y ij 2 step 4 calculate the proximity in this paper proximity indicates the priority level of dmus which can be obtained as follows 10 t i d i d i d i where t i is the proximity and its value ranges from 0 to 1 the value closer to 1 means a greater priority level 2 4 bi level multi objective programming bracken and mcgill 1973 firstly proposed bi level programming bp it includes upper level and lower level decision makers called leadership level and following level respectively zhang et al 2019 the decisions of the upper level and the lower level will feed back and influence each other while the objective functions and constraints of both levels are not necessarily related the leadership level makes the decision first and the following level seeks optimal strategy according to the given scheme then the leadership level will adjust and modify the plan based on the response of the following level until the upper level and lower level decision makers get a relatively unified and satisfactory decision yue et al 2020b the general bp can be expressed as follows 11 max f upper x y 12 s t g x y 0 13 h x y 0 14 max f lower x y 15 s t g x y 0 16 h x y 0 where f upper and f lower are the objective functions of the upper level and lower level respectively eq 12 and eq 13 are the constraints of the upper level eq 15 and eq 16 are the constraints of the lower level x is the decision variable of the upper level y is the decision variable of the lower level in practical decision making process there are often multiple objectives that need to be considered concurrently and they often conflict with and constrain each other yue et al 2020b therefore multi objective programming and bp are combined to formulate bi level multi objective programming bmp model to deal with the multi objective problem at two decision levels the general bmp model can be expressed as follows wang et al 2019 upper level 17 min x 1 f 1 x 1 x 2 min x 1 f 11 x 1 x 2 f 12 x 1 x 2 f 1 m 1 x 1 x 2 lower level 18 min x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 min x 2 f 21 x 1 x 2 f 22 x 1 x 2 f 2 m 2 x 1 x 2 constraint 19 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 20 x 1 0 x 2 0 where m1 and m2 are the number of upper level and lower level objective functions respectively f 1 m 1 x 1 x 2 and f 2 m 2 x 1 x 2 are the upper level and lower level objective functions respectively a1 and a2 are the coefficients in the constraint b is the constraint parameter 2 5 fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming fuzzy credibility constrained programming method is proposed when uncertainty problems need to be described such as risk and violation probability and there are fuzzy uncertainties in the constraints of the model liu and iwamura 1998 this approach based on credibility measure can effectively deal with the problem of fuzzy uncertainties in constraints and provide decision makers with flexible results under more risky scenarios liu and liu 2002 however it cannot handle other complex uncertainty problems especially when the fuzzy uncertainties have boundary grayness therefore it is necessary to use fuzzy interval sets instead of fuzzy sets to solve more complex uncertainties in the model pan et al 2022 the general fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming model can be expressed as follows 21 max f c x 22 c r ax b λ 23 x 0 where f is the objective function a and c are the coefficients in the constraints and the objective function respectively b is the fuzzy interval set x is the decision variable set cr is the credibility measure and λ is the predetermined credibility level of the constraint 2 6 bi level multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming in this paper the above programming methods are combined to develop a bi level multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming model which is presented as follows upper level 24 min x 1 f 1 x 1 x 2 min x 1 f 11 x 1 x 2 f 12 x 1 x 2 f 1 m 1 x 1 x 2 lower level 25 min x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 min x 2 f 21 x 1 x 2 f 22 x 1 x 2 f 2 m 2 x 1 x 2 constraint 26 c r a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b λ 27 x 1 0 x 2 0 assume that the fuzzy interval set in the above model is a triangular fuzzy interval set 28 b b 1 b 2 b 3 b 1 b 1 b 2 b 2 b 3 b 3 then the constraint can be translated as 29 c r a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 1 if a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 1 2 b 2 b 1 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 2 b 2 b 1 if b 1 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 2 b 3 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 2 b 3 b 2 if b 2 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 3 0 if a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 3 2 7 model solution process 1 given a certain credibility level transform the bi level multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming into a bi level multi objective programming see eq 30 in general the credibility constrained programming approach should avoid medium and high risks in realistic scenarios so the credibility level λ should be taken as 0 5 1 0 30 c r a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 2 b 2 b 1 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 2 b 2 b 1 λ a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 2 1 2 λ b 2 b 1 2 decompose the parameters b 2 and b 1 in the transformed constraints into definite values of the upper and lower bounds and solve them separately under the same constraint conditions and then introduce the separate solution steps first calculate the optimal value and the worst value of each objective function of the upper and lower models separately and then convert each objective function into a model that maximizes the objective 3 determine the weights ω of different objectives at the upper and lower decision levels using analytic hierarchy process ahp first the paired comparison matrices of the upper and lower levels are constructed separately where the different objective functions of the upper and lower levels are the indicators of the upper and lower criteria levels respectively then the complete paired comparison matrices were obtained by consulting experts to score the relative importance of different objective functions see table s1 and table s2 the scales of relative importance are shown in table s3 saaty 1990 then the weights ω of different objective functions of the upper and lower levels were obtained by normalizing the elements in each column of the matrices and then averaging each row respectively 4 transform the bi level multi objective model into a bi level single objective model using the minimum deviation method the new objectives can be expressed as follows 31 max f u ω 1 f u 1 f u 1 min f u 1 max f u 1 min ω 2 f u 2 f u 2 min f u 2 max f u 2 min ω i f u i f u i min f u i max f u

function in the upper and lower levels respectively f u i m a x a n d f u i m i n are the optimal and worst values of each objective function in the upper level respectively i 1 2 n f l j m a x and f l j m i n are the optimal and worst values of each objective function in the lower level respectively j 1 2 n f u and f l are the upper and lower levels of the transformed single objective bi level programming model 5 calculate the upper decision level model to obtain the decision variable x u and the objective value f ufromu and use the upper decision level model objective result x u to calculate the lower decision level objective value f lfromu 6 calculate the lower decision level model to obtain the decision variable x l and the objective value f lfroml and use the lower decision level model objective result x l to calculate the upper decision level objective value f ufroml 7 use the maximum tolerance z to establish the membership function of the decision variable as shown below 33 γ x z x x u z x x u z 0 otherwise 8 use the objective values obtained from the step 7 and 8 to establish the membership functions of the upper and lower decision levels objective functions 34

optimization model with the objective of maximizing satisfactory degree to obtain the optimal solution with overall satisfaction for both upper and lower decision level can be obtained the corresponding optimization results are obtained when the parameters b 2 b 1 take the upper and lower bounds values respectively 36 max γ 37 γ γ x γ γ f u γ γ f l x v where γ is the satisfaction degree of the upper and lower decision level models v is the constraint set of the original model 3 building the model in case 3 1 study area the hongyashan irrigation district is located in the lower reaches of the shiyang river basin minqin county gansu province 102 53 103 41 e 38 23 39 04 n fig 2 minqin county borders alxa left banner and right banner of inner mongolia autonomous region in the northeast jinchang city in the west badain jaran desert in the northwest and the oasis belt formed by the alluvial shiyang river in the middle the irrigation district is located in the hinterland of the oasis belt known as the desert oasis with an elevation of 1100 1400 m it is the only large irrigation district in minqin oasis it is also one of the largest self flow irrigation districts in gansu province the hongyashan reservoir in the south is the only source of surface water in the hongyashan irrigation district the hongyashan irrigation district has a typical continental desert climate and belongs to the temperate arid climate zone the area has long sunshine hours of 3142 2 h high radiation sufficient light and heat resources with an annual average temperature of 8 8 c and a large temperature difference between day and night the annual average precipitation is only 113 2 mm and the annual average potential evaporation is 2675 6 mm it is a typical inland arid irrigated agricultural district and it s suitable for crop growth the hongyashan irrigation district has changed from a canal irrigation district to a well canal mixed irrigation district due to a sharp drop in downstream available water caused by the gradual reduction of surface runoff in the shiyang river basin and the increase in upstream water consumption the irrigation district has a large reservoir with a total capacity of 148 million m3 a main canal with a length of 86 7 km 14 trunk canals with a total length of 164 8 km and 91 branch canals with a total length of 499 2 km forming a complete irrigation system there are 8207 agricultural irrigation wells and 6276 sets of automatic measuring facilities have been installed by the end of 2018 with a matching rate of 76 5 at present the actual water supply of various water conservancy projects in the irrigation district is 289 million m3 of which surface water supply reaches 203 million m3 and 244 million m3 is used for agriculture accounting for about 84 42 of the total 3 2 problem statement the ecological management and protection challenges of the hongyashan irrigation district are serious due to its special geographical location poor water resource conditions and its fragile ecological conditions in order to ensure the increasing living standard of the residents there is still a trend of growth of urban living and industrial water consumption in the future the necessary water resources are needed to support the restoration of the ecology in addition agricultural water accounts for more than 80 of the total water use in irrigation district so the contradiction between water supply and demand will be more prominent the basic ecological water allocation of minqin oasis is only 34 million m3 which means the ecological water shortage is still huge and the ecological water of minqin oasis is not fully guaranteed therefore it s a challenging issue for the management of the hongyashan irrigation district to optimize the allocation of water resources under the perspective of the integrated system and to fully consider the reasonable allocation of agricultural and ecological water use 3 3 modeling framework two basic decision makers regional government upper level and farmers lower level need to balance the increase nutritious food production to meet the needs of a growing population with the sustainable use of natural resources yue et al 2020b however the farmers mainly pursue the maximization of the economic benefits of agricultural production luo et al 2021 therefore maximizing the system benefits ecological satisfaction degree and nutritional water productivity are the upper level objectives of the model and maximizing economic benefits and food production are the lower level objectives in addition the model is developed by incorporating multi objective programming bi level programming and fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming table 1 lists the definition of its parameters and variables 3 3 1 objective function upper level objective 1 maximum system benefits the system benefits consist of economic and ecological benefits the economic benefits are the difference between total income and total cost while ecological benefits are calculated by the ecological water productivity proposed by pan et al 2022 which mainly considers the ecological water allocation to the farmland protection forest networks and economic forest 38 max f 11 i 11 k 4 a ik b k y max k 1 k y k 1 j j k s w ikj g w ikj p ikj j j k e t max i k j c 1 i 11 k 4 a ik j j k 10 s w

satisfaction degree carbon sink satisfaction degree and irrigation priority of dmus this indicator reflects the result of upper level decision makers irrigation district managers considering carbon neutrality ecological environment and spatial variability within the irrigation district ecological satisfaction degree is a dimensionless concept and its value is a measure of the degree of achievement of ecological conservation the maximum ecological satisfaction degree represents the maximum sum of carbon sink satisfaction degree and ecological water demand satisfaction degree of different dmus in the irrigation district after considering spatial variability and the specific objective function is shown in eq 41 the formula for calculating ecological water demand satisfaction degree is shown in eq 39 below the concept of carbon sink satisfaction degree is proposed to measure the amount of carbon sink and greater carbon sink satisfaction degree means greater amount of crop

sensing data the remote sensing data of different dmus in the hongyashan irrigation district are mainly obtained directly through the gee platform the persiann cdr dataset the mod16a2 version 6 evapotranspiration latent heat flux product dataset and the mcd12q1 v6 product dataset are used to obtain the rainfall pet and crop area of different dmus during different growth periods in 2020 respectively and their specific values are shown in table s4 table s5 and table s6 the remote sensing data between 2013 and 2020 of wet ndvi ndsi and lst are obtained from gee platform for rsei calculation 3 4 2 other data collection the water price of surface water and groundwater in the hongyashan irrigation district is taken as 0 266 yuan m3 and 0 342 yuan m3 the corresponding irrigation water use efficiency is 0 53 and 0 87 respectively and the water availability for surface water and groundwater is shown in table 2 the ecological water productivity is taken as 7 96 yuan m3 and the ecological water distribution area is taken as table s7 the relevant data of different kinds of crops are shown in table 3 table s8 and table s9 4 application of the model 4 1 processing results of remote sensing data the pet of different dmus and different crop growth periods is obtained through the gee et0 can be obtained by the fitting equation proposed by pan et al 2022 etmax refers to the crop water requirement at full irrigation which is the same as etc and can be obtained by the single crop coefficient method et max k c et 0 recommended by fao 56 table s10 show the specific values the landsat 8 level 2 collection 2 tier 1 dataset and the mod11a2 v6 dataset are used to calculate the four indicators of humidity wet greenness ndvi dryness ndsi and temperature lst respectively rsei is obtained by principal component analysis based on these indicators whose specific values are shown in table s11 the rsei from 2013 to 2020 appears an overall increasing trend indicating that the ecology of this irrigation district has been improved the reason for individual abrupt changes is that the rsei is affected by rainfall the decrease in rainfall will lessen the value of the rsei 4 2 results of dmu irrigation priority the specific division of dmus is shown in fig 3 the topsis method is used for the priority ranking with ei as the evaluation index based on the rsei of each dmu from 2013 to 2020 the priority ranking of the dmus is proximity in brackets dmu 10 0 900 dmu 9 0 889 dmu 4 0 784 dmu 5 0 780 dmu 1 0 764 dmu 11 0 645 dmu 6 0 556 dmu 8 0 378 dmu 7 0 265 dmu 2 0 134 dmu 3 0 029 according to the priority ranking it can be found that the priority weight of the east of the irrigation district can be significantly higher than that of the west the ecology of the east is worse than that of the west and the poorer dmus should be allocated more water in this study the actual ecological water allocation of different dmus is counted the statistical results show that the ecological water allocation is as follows dmu 5 1047 10 4 m 3 dmu 9 761 10 4 m 3 dmu 8 701 10 4 m 3 dmu 2 571 10 4 m 3 dmu 11 476 10 4 m 3 dmu 10 455 10 4 m 3 dmu 3 452 10 4 m 3 dmu 4 420 10 4 m 3 dmu 7 297 10 4 m 3 dmu 6 210 10 4 m 3 dmu 1 51 10 4 m 3 which is different from the obtained dmu priority ranking this discrepancy is the result that the obtained priority ranking considers the ecological quality of different dmus while the actual ecological water allocation considers many other factors such as water allocation area 4 3 optimized results of model 4 3 1 results of objective functions fig 4 a shows the interval values of system benefits and economic benefits under different credibility levels as the credibility level increases from 0 6 to 0 9 the system benefits decrease from 17 64 20 23 10 8 y u a n to 16 63 19 03 10 8 y u a n the economic benefits decrease from 15 07 16 44 10 8 y u a n to 14 84 16 05 10 8 y u a n and the ecological benefits decrease from 2 57 3 79 10 8 y u a n to 1 79 2 98 10 8 y u a n it can be seen that the economic benefits have a more share of system benefits as the level of credibility changes the magnitude of change in ecological benefits is greater than that in economic benefits reflecting the result that changes in surface water availability have a huger impact on ecological benefits fig 4b depicts the changes in ecological satisfaction degree with different credibility levels as the credibility level increases from 0 6 to 0 9 the ecological satisfaction degree decreases from 39 24 44 29 to 38 41 42 73 it is important to note that the interval values of ecological satisfaction do not change as the credibility level decreases from 0 7 to 0 6 displaying that ecological satisfaction reached its maximum at this point even as the amount of surface water availability increased fig 4c describes the nutritional water productivity under each credibility scenario from which it is clear that as the risk of violation increases the nutritional water productivity tends to increase the reason is that the growth of nutrition value is greater than the increase in water with the decline of credibility when the credibility level is 0 9 the nutritional water productivity is 1678 29 1722 60 kcal m3 according to fao balance sheets 2002 the daily energy and protein requirement per person is 2700 kcal which means that about 1 5 m3 of water will be consumed to grow crops in one day to meet the energy demand of the human body moreover the upper bound of nutritional water productivity does not change when the credibility level reduces from 0 7 to 0 6 this phenomenon presents that the upper bound of nutritional water productivity available to decision makers is at its maximum with the rise of surface water fig 4d shows the interval values of crop yield under different credibility levels when the credibility level increases from 0 6 to 0 9 the crop yield decreases from 2 10 2 51 10 8 k g to 1 89 2 24 10 8 k g compared with the actual crop yield of 1 18 10 8 k g in irrigation district the crop yield increases substantially the model can enhance the crop yield under the consideration of spatial variability and wonder nexus in general a higher credibility level represents a higher level of satisfaction with the constraints of the optimization model a higher credibility level also implies a lower risk level and better reliability overall the value of each objective decreases as the credibility level increases that is as the risk of violation decreases the model gradually tends to be conservative and the decision maker is able to obtain fewer benefits which means high investment high risk high return low investment low risk low return pan et al 2022 4 3 2 optimal solutions of water allocation fig 5 exhibits the optimal water allocation schemes for agriculture and ecology in the irrigation district under different credibility levels the ratio of agricultural to ecological water allocation in the irrigation district is about 3 1 which is consistent with the characteristics of water use in the irrigation district both agricultural and ecological water allocations decrease with the increase in the credibility level for example when the credibility level increases from 0 6 to 0 9 the agricultural water allocation decreases from 10393 1 12250 5 10 4 m 3 to 9983 4 11698 9 10 4 m 3 and the ecological water allocation decreases from 3230 2 4755 1 10 4 m 3 to 2259 6 3742 5 10 4 m 3 in terms of constraints an increase in the credibility level leads to a reduction in the amount of surface water availability which in turn results in a reduction in both agricultural and ecological water allocations different credibility levels represent different risk levels of water allocation scenarios and provide a reliable reference for decision makers to choose from different risk scenarios fig 6 shows the optimal schemes of agricultural and ecological water allocation in different dmus under different credibility levels with darker colors representing more allocated water to that dmu the difference in water allocation across dmus reflects spatial variability it is worth noting that the ranking of the allocation amount of water for different dmus is not the same as dmu irrigation priority it is the result of the optimization model taking the combination of multiple objectives of two decision levels into account dmu irrigation priorities irrigation area and planting structure however the water allocation for some dmus remains unchanged or abnormally abrupt with the credibility levels there are two reasons 1 the water allocation of different dmus is mainly directly related to the planting area and ecological water allocation area of dmus 2 there is a large variability in area across different dmus table 4 illuminates the irrigation quota of each crop of different dmus under different credibility levels and the differences in irrigation quota of the same crop of different dmus precisely reflect the characteristics of the spatial variability considered in the model on the whole the irrigation quota of each crop in descending order is seed melon sunflower maize wheat the reason is that the seed melon is a very water consuming crop and has good economic efficiency while the sunflower is more drought tolerant with high benefits and as food crops corn and wheat are less economically efficient but corn still has higher ecological water productivity than wheat as the planting scale of different crops is in order sunflower corn wheat seed melon the total optimal water allocation for each crop after taking the planting area into account is sunflower corn wheat seed melon it can be concluded that the total water allocation of different crops is mainly related to the crop area and less sensitive to the change of the credibility level and irrigation quota which is the reason why the optimized result of crop irrigation quotas does not fully comply with the fuzzy credibility level variations 5 discussion 5 1 flexibility of the model and solution the scenario at the credibility level of 1 0 was chosen to analyze where the model constraints are fully satisfied the results are shown in table 5 and table 6 the water allocation per unit area for each crop in descending order is seed melon sunflower corn wheat which is consistent with the results at other credibility levels fig 7 shows the agricultural and ecological water allocation in different dmus when the credibility level is 1 0 the agricultural water allocation in different dmus in descending order is dmu 5 dmu 11 dmu 8 dmu 7 dmu 2 dmu 6 dmu 4 dmu 3 dmu 9 dmu 10 dmu 1 and the ecological water allocation in descending order is dmu 5 dmu 2 dmu 3 dmu 4 dmu 9 dmu 8 dmu 11 dmu 10 dmu 7 dmu 6 dmu 1 which are different from the results of other credibility levels revealing that the change of the credibility level affects the water allocation when the credibility level is 1 0 the model has no constraint violation risk but low benefits and decision makers should choose the proper credibility level by trading off the system benefits and violation risk according to the actual conditions therefore in this study different credibility levels are introduced thus more feasible water allocation schemes can be obtained reflecting the flexibility of the model note uba means the upper bounds of agricultural water allocation lba means the lower bounds of agricultural water allocation ube means the upper bounds of ecological water allocation lbe means the lower bounds of ecological water allocation 5 2 effectiveness of the model in order to verify the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed model in dealing with water resource allocation considering spatial variability seven optimization models table 7 were formulated and solved and the optimized results were compared with the proposed model at a credibility level of 1 0 the comparison results are shown in fig 8 which show that 1 although the single objective model can obtain the optimal value of the objective it cannot consider other important factors 2 multi objective models can better coordinate multiple aspects in the game process making the optimal allocation more consistent with the actual situation and the needs of decision makers pan et al 2022 although the objective values of multi objective models are inferior to those of single objective models in a certain aspect they are generally better than those of single objective models in other aspects 3 the bi level multi objective model can reflect the leadership of the upper level decision makers to the lower level decision makers because the objectives obtained by the bi level multi objective model is closer to those of the upper level decision maker zhang et al 2019 4 the objective function values of the proposed model are the middle values of the objective function values of other models and the reason for this result is that the model considers the bi level multi objective programming and wonder nexus 6 conclusions in this study a novel optimization framework is developed by introducing ecological satisfaction degree irrigation priority and food nutritional value from the perspective of wonder nexus and integrating bi level multi objective programming and fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming the contributions of this framework are 1 quantifying the complex interconnections of wonder nexus 2 proposing a method for determining irrigation priority in arid irrigation areas obtaining priority ranking of different dmus by rsei and topsis 3 constructing an ecological satisfaction degree index to characterize the degree of achievement of ecological objectives set for irrigation districts 4 generating sustainable agricultural water and ecological water allocation schemes in addition the framework is able to deal with dual uncertainty fuzzy interval set parameters variables and different decision making bodies preferences the framework is applied to the agricultural and ecological water allocation in hongyashan irrigation district and the results show that 1 the irrigation priority is dmu 10 0 900 dmu 9 0 889 dmu 4 0 784 dmu 5 0 780 dmu 1 0 764 dmu 11 0 645 dmu 6 0 556 dmu 8 0 378 dmu 7 0 265 dmu 2 0 134 dmu 3 0 029 2 as the credibility level increases the decrease in surface water availability leads to a decrease in the value of each objective when the credibility level is 1 0 the system benefit is 16 18 18 47 10 8 y u a n the ecological satisfaction is 38 02 42 73 the nutritional water productivity is 1675 72 1716 41 kcal m3 the economic benefit is 14 05 15 77 10 8 y u a n and the crop yield is 1 89 2 24 10 8 k g 3 the ratio of water allocation for agriculture to ecology in the irrigation district is about 3 1 which is consistent with the characteristics of water use in the study area and the increase of credibility level will lead to the decrease of water allocation for agriculture and ecology 4 the total water allocation for different crops is mainly determined by the crop area specifically the water allocation of different crops is sunflower maize wheat seed melon the bi level multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming model established in this study can well coordinate the upper and lower decision makers and multiple decision objectives contained in each level and can obtain the optimal water allocation strategy of agricultural and ecological water resources based on different risk scenarios under wonder nexus and the model can be integrated with practical operations to provide decision support for agricultural and ecological management in arid areas this study is equally applicable to other purposes of water use including urban and industrial water by analyzing specific problems of urban and industrial water use under wonder nexus to formulate the optimization model with the corresponding formulas and

1851,multiple subsystems such as water food land carbon ecology and nutrition are closely intertwined and the resulting complexity and uncertainty pose challenges to water resource management this study proposes an optimization framework from a novel water food carbon land ecology nutrition wonder nexus perspective for the integrated management of agricultural and ecological water resources firstly the irrigation priority ranking of decision making units dmu is obtained based on the remote sensing indices from the google earth engine gee platform secondly the ecological satisfaction degree which aggregates carbon sink satisfaction degree and ecological water demand satisfaction degree is proposed to characterize the degree of achieving the pre given ecological objectives then the above two indicators i e the irrigation priority ranking and the ecological satisfaction degree are integrated with a fuzzy interval credibility constrained bi level multi objective programming model to realize 1 reconciling conflicts in food nutrition food security economic development and ecological conservation 2 making trade offs among the positions and preferences of different decision makers 3 dealing with the dual uncertainties of fuzzy interval parameters 4 obtaining optimal agricultural and ecological water allocation schemes the applicability of the model is verified by taking hongyashan irrigation district of minqin county as an example the results show that 1 the irrigation priority ranking for the dmus is dmu 10 dmu 9 dmu 4 dmu 5 dmu 1 dmu 11 dmu 6 dmu 8 dmu 7 dmu 2 dmu 3 2 the ratio of agricultural to ecological water allocation in the irrigation district is about 3 1 which is consistent with the water use characteristics of this area 3 the total water allocation during the whole growth period for different crops is mainly determined by planting area and the ranking of the water allocation is sunflower maize wheat seed melon moreover compared with the single level models the inexact bi level multi objective model can well coordinate the upper and lower decision makers and the multiple decision objectives under the wonder nexus therefore the proposed framework can provide the scientific basis for balancing agricultural and ecological water management and conflicting objectives in similar irrigation districts through involving multiple subsystems and perspectives keywords water food carbon land ecology nutrition nexus gee irrigation priority fuzzy interval sets bi level multi objective programming optimal water resources allocation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in arid agricultural areas agriculture is not only the largest water consuming sector but also the main factor leading to increasing environmental pollution moreover they are facing water shortages and serious ecological problems pan et al 2022 meanwhile nutritional security has become one of the primary challenges addressed since the 21st century according to report the state of food security and nutrition in the world in 2022 there are 702 to 828 million people worldwide suffering from hunger in 2021 and the number of people affected by hunger has increased by 150 million since 2019 before the covid 19 pandemic fao et al 2022 high costs and low affordability prevent billions of people from eating healthy or nutritious food in addition excessive carbon emissions threaten global ecological security thus carbon peaking and carbon neutrality have been critical tasks in china moreover the farmland ecosystem is the most active carbon pool in terrestrial ecosystems and it s most affected by human activities therefore how to manage the limited water resources in arid areas to ensure food security ecological security and the achievement of dual carbon goals and enhance the sustainability of agricultural systems are challenging issues in arid agricultural areas many factors influence optimal water resource allocation and the interrelationship among these subsystems needs to be qualified systematically and comprehensively failing to consider interdependencies can lead to the mismanagement of critical resources and threaten socioeconomic development and environmental sustainability sarkodie and owusu 2020 the nexus approach allows optimizing water allocation strategy integrating the interaction of different factors for example li et al 2019 developed an integrated intuitionistic fuzzy multi objective nonlinear model to manage the water food energy system ma et al 2020 proposed a bi level chance constrained programming model for water management under water food ecology nexus system yue et al 2021 constructed a me measure fuzzy chance constrained mixed integer multi objective non linear programming model from a novel water food energy climate change land nexus perspective maraseni et al 2021 developed an integrated regional water food energy nexus optimization model to investigate the effects of optimizing land and water resource use on agricultural production profitability and ghg emissions in an irrigated agricultural production system yao et al 2021 presented an optimization model to optimize the allocation of limited resources and maximize irrigation water productivity in water food land nexus system ren et al 2022 proposed a water energy food carbon nexus system for optimization aiming to increase irrigation water productivity reduce carbon emissions and enhance regional agriculture competitiveness guo et al 2022 formulated a distributed multi objective model based on the water food energy nexus with food production security as constraint many studies have considered food factors and carbon factors in nexus but the food factors considered in nexus mainly referred to food production and few studies on food nutrition in nexus have been undertaken nevertheless the above studies are less likely to simultaneously include food production food nutrition ecological and carbon factors within the study system therefore this study proposed the water food carbon land ecology nutrition wonder nexus which integrated multiple subsystems including water resources food carbon farmland ecology subsystem and nutrition with the connection of water quantity it s noted that water allocation under this nexus should pay attention to the following three aspects in arid agricultural areas water allocation in arid agricultural areas should consider ecological security on the one hand ecological stability is more dependent on the amount of water resources in ecologically fragile areas kuriqi et al 2020 meeting the ecological water demand is a necessary condition for realizing sustainable agriculture and it s beneficial to prevent land degradation and desertification thereby protecting the ecology from being destroyed and maintaining the integrity and ecological balance of the watershed ecological water demand satisfaction degree is a quantitative indicator to measure the degree of achievement of ecological conservation objectives for the rational allocation of water resources on the other hand carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals were launched to alleviate global warming the farmland ecosystem has the dual properties of carbon source and carbon sink and thus can contribute to the dual carbon goals achieving it is worth noting that agricultural vegetation can fix carbon in the atmosphere through photosynthesis if the resulting carbon sink can be disposed of properly it will be helpful in carbon reduction she et al 2017 xiong et al 2017 he et al 2022 the concept of carbon sink satisfaction degree was initiated to characterize the degree of achievement of carbon sink targets greater carbon sink satisfaction degree represents more carbon sink of crops in fact the ecological subsystem and the carbon subsystem are closely linked and intertwined therefore in this study the index of ecological satisfaction degree is constructed through combining the above indicators to depict the interaction between the two subsystems optimizing water allocation in arid agricultural areas requires identifying the importance of water users to maximize the value of limited water resources since they may not be sufficient for all crops at this point managers need to decide which areas have higher priority to be irrigated or allocated more water previous studies have found that prioritizing different regions in water resource management can effectively address this dilemma luo et al 2021 generally speaking it is vital to concern about ecological factors in water allocation and managers tend to set aside more water for areas with poorer ecological conditions to achieve the goal of maintaining ecological stability remote sensing based ecological index rsei is an index that can quickly detect and evaluate the ecological quality of a region xu 2013 and a higher value means the better ecological quality of the region getting rsei needs remote sensing data on calculation however the traditional remote sensing processing method involves users querying remote sensing data downloading remote sensing data and then using professional software to perform further arithmetic or visualization there are limitations such as the slow download speed the large download data volume and the complicated processing operation the emergence of google earth engine gee effectively solves these problems the remote sensing data of decision making units dmus in the irrigation district can be obtained quickly and easily in the gee therefore by extracting the rsei of dmus from gee the irrigation priority ranking of dmus is calculated water resource allocation should weigh the positions and multiple preferences of different decision makers and deal with uncertainties there are two basic groups of decision makers in a typical agricultural production system namely farmers and regional managers ahmad et al 2018 cai et al 2018 farmers are direct producers who aim to obtain additional benefits and products while regional managers have to organize agricultural water resources from a more macroscopic perspective in addition each group of decision makers may have multiple conflicting objectives which further complicates the decision making process due to the effectiveness of the bi level multi objective programming bmp model for two multi objective decision levels bmp is introduced into decision making weighing multiple objectives of farmers and regional managers zhang et al 2019 meanwhile uncertain information often appears in the process of water resources management such as water supply water demand of crops and vegetation crop prices and production costs marques et al 2005 guo et al 2019 and a reasonable analysis of uncertain information can provide a more effective solution for water resources allocation zhang and guo 2017 fuzzy credibility constrained programming can deal with violation constraints satisfied at predetermined credibility levels in a fuzzy environment optimal solutions and decisions can be made at different pre determined credibility levels for supporting decision making zhang et al 2022 in the real world a single uncertainty is difficult to handle complex parameters fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming based on fuzzy interval sets can solve the problem of violated constraint under dual uncertainty pan et al 2022 for example zhang et al 2018 used fuzzy interval sets to represent the uncertainty of water supply and precipitation and employed the fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming to optimize the monthly crop water allocation yue et al 2020a optimized the water allocation schemes and system benefits and fuzzy interval sets were introduced to describe the available water and crop water demand therefore this study aims to balance the prevalent leader follower relationship and multi objective conflicts based on incorporation of bmp and fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming for optimal allocation of agricultural and ecological water under wonder nexus and uncertainties in summary this study proposes a wonder nexus to reflect the complex response relationships of agricultural systems to resource allocation in this perspective a bi level multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained modeling approach is developed to manage water resources and handle multiple preferences of different decision makers and uncertainties specifically an ecological satisfaction degree index and an innovative irrigation priority method are set up and the violation constraints under the dual uncertainty are considered the model framework is then demonstrated by the application in the hongyashan irrigation district of minqin county in the lower reaches of shiyang river basin the optimized results under different credibility levels can provide reasonable schemes and scientific basis for balancing agricultural and ecological water management in the irrigation district the framework of the study is shown in fig 1 2 methodology 2 1 division of dmus and extraction of remote sensing data the division of dmus is determined mainly according to the irrigation district management layout and the structure of canal systems based on gee the persiann cdr dataset the mod16a2 version 6 evapotranspiration latent heat flux dataset and the mcd12q1 v6 dataset are adopted then the results of the divided dmus are uploaded to gee and remote sensing data of precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet and crop planting area of different dmus are extracted the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 is widely used as et0 calculated by penman monteith eq p m is highly accurate tang et al 2019 however due to the limitation of meteorological stations for data collection et0 obtained by traditional methods cannot represent the difference of crop evapotranspiration in complex surface land conditions using pet data by rs to represent the et0 can reflect the temporal and spatial variability but the actual crop evapotranspiration is often overestimated for errors values in pet data it is a better way to fit and correct et0 data obtained from several meteorological stations with the pet data which can not only extend the traditional et0 to the spatial scale but also ensure the accuracy of actual crop evapotranspiration pan et al 2022 therefore this study will use the fitting equation proposed by pan et al 2022 for the same study area the maximum evapotranspiration etmax refers to the crop water demand at full irrigation which is determined by referring to the single crop coefficient method et max k c et 0 as recommended by fao 56 1 e t max k c e t 0 k c 0 9075 p e t 20 411 where kc refers to crop coefficient 2 2 calculation of rsei and ei rsei combines four evaluation indicators vegetation index moisture component surface temperature and soil index which represents four major ecological elements as greenness moisture heat and dryness respectively its remote sensing definition is shown in eq 2 by integrating the four evaluation indicators with the principal component analysis pca the influence of each indicator on the rsei is determined by the nature of the data itself rather than by subjective weighting therefore the integration approach of pca is more objective and reasonable 2 rsei f g r e e n n e s s w e t n e s s h e a t d r y n e s s f n d v i w e t l s t n d s i where ndvi is the normalized vegetation index wet is the humidity index lst is the surface temperature ndsi presents the index of dryness integrated from the bare soil index si and the built up index ibi ndsi s i i b i 2 the landsat 8 level 2 collection 2 tier 1 dataset and the mod11a2 v6 datasets are used to calculate the four indicators of wet ndvi ndsi and lst respectively and then rsei is obtained by normalization and pca afterwards ei is obtained by using the expression ei 1 resi rsei is the indicator of the ecological environment condition and the larger the rsei the better the ecological environment while the larger the ei the worse the ecological environment therefore dmus with worse ecological environment have lager values of ei and higher weights by using the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis method which means higher priority to be irrigated or allocated more water all the above processes are completed on gee platform 2 3 calculation of priority level of dmus the ei of each dmu in different years calculated in section 2 2 is used as evaluation indexes and topsis method is adopted to prioritize the water allocation for different dmus the specific steps for the priority ranking of dmus are presented as follows luo et al 2021 step 1 standardize ei of different dmus and construct the evaluation matrix the processing method for the larger the better indicator is shown in eq 3 for the smaller the better indicator is shown in eq 4 and the processed standardized matrix is shown in eq 5 3 r ij v ij min v ij max v ij min v ij 4 r ij max v ij v ij max v ij min v ij 5 r r 11 r 12 r 1 n r 21 r 22 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r mn where rij refers to the standardized value of the evaluation indicator in year j of dmu i v ij denotes the initial value of the evaluation indicator in year j of dmu i r is the standardized evaluation matrix i represents the index of dmu j represents the index of year step 2 solve the positive and negative ideal solutions let y be the maximum value of year j in dmu i which is called the positive ideal solution and y be the minimum value of the year j in dmu i which is called the negative ideal solution 6 y max 1 j n r ij j 1 2 n y 1 y 2 y n 7 y max 1 j n r ij j 1 2 n y 1 y 2 y n step 3 calculate the distance by euclidean distance formula 8 d i j 1 n y j y ij 2 9 d i j 1 n y j y ij 2 step 4 calculate the proximity in this paper proximity indicates the priority level of dmus which can be obtained as follows 10 t i d i d i d i where t i is the proximity and its value ranges from 0 to 1 the value closer to 1 means a greater priority level 2 4 bi level multi objective programming bracken and mcgill 1973 firstly proposed bi level programming bp it includes upper level and lower level decision makers called leadership level and following level respectively zhang et al 2019 the decisions of the upper level and the lower level will feed back and influence each other while the objective functions and constraints of both levels are not necessarily related the leadership level makes the decision first and the following level seeks optimal strategy according to the given scheme then the leadership level will adjust and modify the plan based on the response of the following level until the upper level and lower level decision makers get a relatively unified and satisfactory decision yue et al 2020b the general bp can be expressed as follows 11 max f upper x y 12 s t g x y 0 13 h x y 0 14 max f lower x y 15 s t g x y 0 16 h x y 0 where f upper and f lower are the objective functions of the upper level and lower level respectively eq 12 and eq 13 are the constraints of the upper level eq 15 and eq 16 are the constraints of the lower level x is the decision variable of the upper level y is the decision variable of the lower level in practical decision making process there are often multiple objectives that need to be considered concurrently and they often conflict with and constrain each other yue et al 2020b therefore multi objective programming and bp are combined to formulate bi level multi objective programming bmp model to deal with the multi objective problem at two decision levels the general bmp model can be expressed as follows wang et al 2019 upper level 17 min x 1 f 1 x 1 x 2 min x 1 f 11 x 1 x 2 f 12 x 1 x 2 f 1 m 1 x 1 x 2 lower level 18 min x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 min x 2 f 21 x 1 x 2 f 22 x 1 x 2 f 2 m 2 x 1 x 2 constraint 19 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 20 x 1 0 x 2 0 where m1 and m2 are the number of upper level and lower level objective functions respectively f 1 m 1 x 1 x 2 and f 2 m 2 x 1 x 2 are the upper level and lower level objective functions respectively a1 and a2 are the coefficients in the constraint b is the constraint parameter 2 5 fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming fuzzy credibility constrained programming method is proposed when uncertainty problems need to be described such as risk and violation probability and there are fuzzy uncertainties in the constraints of the model liu and iwamura 1998 this approach based on credibility measure can effectively deal with the problem of fuzzy uncertainties in constraints and provide decision makers with flexible results under more risky scenarios liu and liu 2002 however it cannot handle other complex uncertainty problems especially when the fuzzy uncertainties have boundary grayness therefore it is necessary to use fuzzy interval sets instead of fuzzy sets to solve more complex uncertainties in the model pan et al 2022 the general fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming model can be expressed as follows 21 max f c x 22 c r ax b λ 23 x 0 where f is the objective function a and c are the coefficients in the constraints and the objective function respectively b is the fuzzy interval set x is the decision variable set cr is the credibility measure and λ is the predetermined credibility level of the constraint 2 6 bi level multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming in this paper the above programming methods are combined to develop a bi level multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming model which is presented as follows upper level 24 min x 1 f 1 x 1 x 2 min x 1 f 11 x 1 x 2 f 12 x 1 x 2 f 1 m 1 x 1 x 2 lower level 25 min x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 min x 2 f 21 x 1 x 2 f 22 x 1 x 2 f 2 m 2 x 1 x 2 constraint 26 c r a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b λ 27 x 1 0 x 2 0 assume that the fuzzy interval set in the above model is a triangular fuzzy interval set 28 b b 1 b 2 b 3 b 1 b 1 b 2 b 2 b 3 b 3 then the constraint can be translated as 29 c r a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 1 if a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 1 2 b 2 b 1 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 2 b 2 b 1 if b 1 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 2 b 3 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 2 b 3 b 2 if b 2 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 3 0 if a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 3 2 7 model solution process 1 given a certain credibility level transform the bi level multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming into a bi level multi objective programming see eq 30 in general the credibility constrained programming approach should avoid medium and high risks in realistic scenarios so the credibility level λ should be taken as 0 5 1 0 30 c r a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 2 b 2 b 1 a 1

separately under the same constraint conditions and then introduce the separate solution steps first calculate the optimal value and the worst value of each objective function of the upper and lower models separately and then convert each objective function into a model that maximizes the objective 3 determine the weights ω of different objectives at the upper and lower decision levels using analytic hierarchy process ahp first the paired comparison matrices of the upper and lower levels are constructed separately where the different objective functions of the upper and lower levels are the indicators of the upper and lower criteria levels respectively then the complete paired comparison matrices were obtained by consulting experts to score the relative importance of different objective functions see table s1 and table s2 the scales of relative importance are shown in table s3 saaty 1990 then the weights ω of different objective functions of the upper and lower levels were obtained by normalizing the elements in each column of the matrices and then averaging each row respectively 4 transform the bi level multi objective model into a bi level single objective model using the minimum deviation method the new objectives can be expressed as follows 31 max f u ω 1 f u 1 f u 1 min f u 1 max f u 1 min ω 2 f u 2 f u 2 min f u 2 max f u 2 min ω i f u i f u i min f u i max f u

function in the upper and lower levels respectively f u i m a x a n d f u i m i n are the optimal and worst values of each objective function in the upper level respectively i 1 2 n f l j m a x and f

optimization model with the objective of maximizing satisfactory degree to obtain the optimal solution with overall satisfaction for both upper and lower decision level can be obtained the corresponding optimization results are obtained when the parameters b 2 b 1 take the upper and lower bounds values respectively 36 max γ 37 γ γ x γ γ f u γ γ f l x v where γ is the satisfaction degree of the upper and lower decision level models v is the constraint set of the original model 3 building the model in case 3 1 study area the hongyashan irrigation district is located in the lower reaches of the shiyang river basin minqin county gansu province 102 53 103 41 e 38 23 39 04 n fig 2 minqin county borders alxa left banner and right banner of inner mongolia autonomous region in the northeast jinchang city in the west badain jaran desert in the northwest and the oasis belt formed by the alluvial shiyang river in the middle the irrigation district is located in the hinterland of the oasis belt known as the desert oasis with an elevation of 1100 1400 m it is the only large irrigation district in minqin oasis it is also one of the largest self flow irrigation districts in gansu province the hongyashan reservoir in the south is the only source of surface water in the hongyashan irrigation district the hongyashan irrigation district has a typical continental desert climate and belongs to the temperate arid climate zone the area has long sunshine hours of 3142 2 h high radiation sufficient light and heat resources with an annual average temperature of 8 8 c and a large temperature difference between day and night the annual average precipitation is only 113 2 mm and the annual average potential evaporation is 2675 6 mm it is a typical inland arid irrigated agricultural district and it s suitable for crop growth the hongyashan irrigation district has changed from a canal irrigation district to a well canal mixed irrigation district due to a sharp drop in downstream available water caused by the gradual reduction of surface runoff in the shiyang river basin and the increase in upstream water consumption the irrigation district has a large reservoir with a total capacity of 148 million m3 a main canal with a length of 86 7 km 14 trunk canals with a total length of 164 8 km and 91 branch canals with a total length of 499 2 km forming a complete irrigation system there are 8207 agricultural irrigation wells and 6276 sets of automatic measuring facilities have been installed by the end of 2018 with a matching rate of 76 5 at present the actual water supply of various water conservancy projects in the irrigation district is 289 million m3 of which surface water supply reaches 203 million m3 and 244 million m3 is used for agriculture accounting for about 84 42 of the total 3 2 problem statement the ecological management and protection challenges of the hongyashan irrigation district are serious due to its special geographical location poor water resource conditions and its fragile ecological conditions in order to ensure the increasing living standard of the residents there is still a trend of growth of urban living and industrial water consumption in the future the necessary water resources are needed to support the restoration of the ecology in addition agricultural water accounts for more than 80 of the total water use in irrigation district so the contradiction between water supply and demand will be more prominent the basic ecological water allocation of minqin oasis is only 34 million m3 which means the ecological water shortage is still huge and the ecological water of minqin oasis is not fully guaranteed therefore it s a challenging issue for the management of the hongyashan irrigation district to optimize the allocation of water resources under the perspective of the integrated system and to fully consider the reasonable allocation of agricultural and ecological water use 3 3 modeling framework two basic decision makers regional government upper level and farmers lower level need to balance the increase nutritious food production to meet the needs of a growing population with the sustainable use of natural resources yue et al 2020b however the farmers mainly pursue the maximization of the economic benefits of agricultural production luo et al 2021 therefore maximizing the system benefits ecological satisfaction degree and nutritional water productivity are the upper level objectives of the model and maximizing economic benefits and food production are the lower level objectives in addition the model is developed by incorporating multi objective programming bi level programming and fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming table 1 lists the definition of its parameters and variables 3 3 1 objective function upper level objective 1 maximum system benefits the system benefits consist of economic and ecological benefits the economic benefits are the difference between total income and total cost while ecological benefits are calculated by the ecological water productivity proposed by pan et al 2022 which mainly considers the ecological water allocation to the farmland protection forest networks and economic forest 38 max f 11 i 11 k 4 a ik b k y max k 1 k y k 1 j j k s w ikj g w ikj p ikj j j k e t max i k j c 1 i 11 k 4 a ik j j k 10 s w

satisfaction degree carbon sink satisfaction degree and irrigation priority of dmus this indicator reflects the result of upper level decision makers irrigation district managers considering carbon

achievement of ecological conservation the maximum ecological satisfaction degree represents the maximum sum of carbon sink satisfaction degree and ecological water demand satisfaction degree of different dmus in the irrigation district after considering spatial variability and the specific objective function is shown in eq 41 the formula for calculating ecological water demand satisfaction degree is shown in eq 39 below the concept of carbon sink satisfaction degree is proposed to measure the amount of carbon sink and greater carbon sink satisfaction degree means greater amount of crop

sensing data the remote sensing data of different dmus in the hongyashan irrigation district are mainly obtained directly through the gee platform the persiann cdr dataset the mod16a2 version 6 evapotranspiration latent heat flux product dataset and the mcd12q1 v6 product dataset are used to obtain the rainfall pet and crop area of different dmus during different growth periods in 2020 respectively and their specific values are shown in table s4 table s5 and table s6 the remote sensing data between 2013 and 2020 of wet ndvi ndsi and lst are obtained from gee platform for rsei calculation 3 4 2 other data collection the water price of surface water and groundwater in the hongyashan irrigation district is taken as 0 266 yuan m3 and 0 342 yuan m3 the corresponding irrigation water use efficiency is 0 53 and 0 87 respectively and the water availability for surface water and groundwater is shown in table 2 the ecological water productivity is taken as 7 96 yuan m3 and the ecological water distribution area is taken as table s7 the relevant data of different kinds of crops are shown in table 3 table s8 and table s9 4 application of the model 4 1 processing results of remote sensing data the pet of different dmus and different crop growth periods is obtained through the gee et0 can be obtained by the fitting equation proposed by pan et al 2022 etmax refers to the crop water requirement at full irrigation which is the same as etc and can be obtained by the single crop coefficient method et max k c et 0 recommended by fao 56 table s10 show the specific values the landsat 8 level 2 collection 2 tier 1 dataset and the mod11a2 v6 dataset are used to calculate the four indicators of humidity wet greenness ndvi dryness ndsi and temperature lst respectively rsei is obtained by principal component analysis based on these indicators whose specific values are shown in table s11 the rsei from 2013 to 2020 appears an overall increasing trend indicating that the ecology of this irrigation district has been improved the reason for individual abrupt changes is that the rsei is affected by rainfall the decrease in rainfall will lessen the value of the rsei 4 2 results of dmu irrigation priority the specific division of dmus is shown in fig 3 the topsis method is used for the priority ranking with ei as the evaluation index based on the rsei of each dmu from 2013 to 2020 the priority ranking of the dmus is proximity in brackets dmu 10 0 900 dmu 9 0 889 dmu 4 0 784 dmu 5 0 780 dmu 1 0 764 dmu 11 0 645 dmu 6 0 556 dmu 8 0 378 dmu 7 0 265 dmu 2 0 134 dmu 3 0 029 according to the priority ranking it can be found that the priority weight of the east of the irrigation district can be significantly higher than that of the west the ecology of the east is worse than that of the west and the poorer dmus should be allocated more water in this study the actual ecological water allocation of different dmus is counted the statistical results show that the ecological water allocation is as follows dmu 5 1047 10 4 m 3 dmu 9 761 10 4 m 3 dmu 8 701 10 4 m 3 dmu 2 571 10 4 m 3 dmu 11 476 10 4 m 3 dmu 10 455 10 4 m 3 dmu 3 452 10 4 m 3 dmu 4 420 10 4 m 3 dmu 7 297 10 4 m 3 dmu 6 210 10 4 m 3 dmu 1 51 10 4 m 3 which is different from the obtained dmu priority ranking this discrepancy is the result that the obtained priority ranking considers the ecological quality of different dmus while the actual ecological water allocation considers many other factors such as water allocation area 4 3 optimized results of model 4 3 1 results of objective functions fig 4 a shows the interval values of system benefits and economic benefits under different credibility levels as the credibility level increases from 0 6 to 0 9 the system benefits decrease from 17 64 20 23 10 8 y u a n to 16 63 19 03 10 8 y u a n the economic benefits decrease from 15 07 16 44 10 8 y u a n to 14 84 16 05 10 8 y u a n and the ecological benefits decrease from 2 57 3 79 10 8 y u a n to 1 79 2 98 10 8 y u a n it can be seen that the economic benefits have a more share of system benefits as the level of credibility changes the magnitude of change in ecological benefits is greater than that in economic benefits reflecting the result that changes in surface water availability have a huger impact on ecological benefits fig 4b depicts the changes in ecological satisfaction degree with different credibility levels as the credibility level increases from 0 6 to 0 9 the ecological satisfaction degree decreases from 39 24 44 29 to 38 41 42 73 it is important to note that the interval values of ecological satisfaction do not change as the credibility level decreases from 0 7 to 0 6 displaying that ecological satisfaction reached its maximum at this point even as the amount of surface water availability increased fig 4c describes the nutritional water productivity under each credibility scenario from which it is clear that as the risk of violation increases the nutritional water productivity tends to increase the reason is that the growth of nutrition value is greater than the increase in water with the decline of credibility when the credibility level is 0 9 the nutritional water productivity is 1678 29 1722 60 kcal m3 according to fao balance sheets 2002 the daily energy and protein requirement per person is 2700 kcal which means that about 1 5 m3 of water will be consumed to grow crops in one day to meet the energy demand of the human body moreover the upper bound of nutritional water productivity does not change when the credibility level reduces from 0 7 to 0 6 this phenomenon presents that the upper bound of nutritional water productivity available to decision makers is at its maximum with the rise of surface water fig 4d shows the interval values of crop yield under different credibility levels when the credibility level increases from 0 6 to 0 9 the crop yield decreases from 2 10 2 51 10 8 k g to 1 89 2 24 10 8 k g compared with the actual crop yield of 1 18 10 8 k g in irrigation district the crop yield increases substantially the model can enhance the crop yield under the consideration of spatial variability and wonder nexus in general a higher credibility level represents a higher level of satisfaction with the constraints of the optimization model a higher credibility level also implies a lower risk level and better reliability overall the value of each objective decreases as the credibility level increases that is as the risk of violation decreases the model gradually tends to be conservative and the decision maker is able to obtain fewer benefits which means high investment high risk high return low investment low risk low return pan et al 2022 4 3 2 optimal solutions of water allocation fig 5 exhibits the optimal water allocation schemes for agriculture and ecology in the irrigation district under different credibility levels the ratio of agricultural to ecological water allocation in the irrigation district is about 3 1 which is consistent with the characteristics of water use in the irrigation district both agricultural and ecological water allocations decrease with the increase in the credibility level for example when the credibility level increases from 0 6 to 0 9 the agricultural water allocation decreases from 10393 1 12250 5 10 4 m 3 to 9983 4 11698 9 10 4 m 3 and the ecological water allocation decreases from 3230 2 4755 1 10 4 m 3 to 2259 6 3742 5 10 4 m 3 in terms of constraints an increase in the credibility level leads to a reduction in the amount of surface water availability which in turn results in a reduction in both agricultural and ecological water allocations different credibility levels represent different risk levels of water allocation scenarios and provide a reliable reference for decision makers to choose from different risk scenarios fig 6 shows the optimal schemes of agricultural and ecological water allocation in different dmus under different credibility levels with darker colors representing more allocated water to that dmu the difference in water allocation across dmus reflects spatial variability it is worth noting that the ranking of the allocation amount of water for different dmus is not the same as dmu irrigation priority it is the result of the optimization model taking the combination of multiple objectives of two decision levels into account dmu irrigation priorities irrigation area and planting structure however the water allocation for some dmus remains unchanged or abnormally abrupt with the credibility levels there are two reasons 1 the water allocation of different dmus is mainly directly related to the planting area and ecological water allocation area of dmus 2 there is a large variability in area across different dmus table 4 illuminates the irrigation quota of each crop of different dmus under different credibility levels and the differences in irrigation quota of the same crop of different dmus precisely reflect the characteristics of the spatial variability considered in the model on the whole the irrigation quota of each crop in descending order is seed melon sunflower maize wheat the reason is that the seed melon is a very water consuming crop and has good economic efficiency while the sunflower is more drought tolerant with high benefits and as food crops corn and wheat are less economically efficient but corn still has higher ecological water productivity than wheat as the planting scale of different crops is in order sunflower corn wheat seed melon the total optimal water allocation for each crop after taking the planting area into account is sunflower corn wheat seed melon it can be concluded that the total water allocation of different crops is mainly related to the crop area and less sensitive to the change of the credibility level and irrigation quota which is the reason why the optimized result of crop irrigation quotas does not fully comply with the fuzzy credibility level variations 5 discussion 5 1 flexibility of the model and solution the scenario at the credibility level of 1 0 was chosen to analyze where the model constraints are fully satisfied the results are shown in table 5 and table 6 the water allocation per unit area for each crop in descending order is seed melon sunflower corn wheat which is consistent with the results at other credibility levels fig 7 shows the agricultural and ecological water allocation in different dmus when the credibility level is 1 0 the agricultural water allocation in different dmus in descending order is dmu 5 dmu 11 dmu 8 dmu 7 dmu 2 dmu 6 dmu 4 dmu 3 dmu 9 dmu 10 dmu 1 and the ecological water allocation in descending order is dmu 5 dmu 2 dmu 3 dmu 4 dmu 9 dmu 8 dmu 11 dmu 10 dmu 7 dmu 6 dmu 1 which are different from the results of other credibility levels revealing that the change of the credibility level affects the water allocation when the credibility level is 1 0 the model has no constraint violation risk but low benefits and decision makers should choose the proper credibility level by trading off the system benefits and violation risk according to the actual conditions therefore in this study different credibility levels are introduced thus more feasible water allocation schemes can be obtained reflecting the flexibility of the model note uba means the upper bounds of agricultural water allocation lba means the lower bounds of agricultural water allocation ube means the upper bounds of ecological water allocation lbe means the lower bounds of ecological water allocation 5 2 effectiveness of the model in order to verify the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed model in dealing with water resource allocation considering spatial variability seven optimization models table 7 were formulated and solved and the optimized results were compared with the proposed model at a credibility level of 1 0 the comparison results are shown in fig 8 which show that 1 although the single objective model can obtain the optimal value of the objective it cannot consider other important factors 2 multi objective models can better coordinate multiple aspects in the game process making the optimal allocation more consistent with the actual situation and the needs of decision makers pan et al 2022 although the objective values of multi objective models are inferior to those of single objective models in a certain aspect they are generally better than those of single objective models in other aspects 3 the bi level multi objective model can reflect the leadership of the upper level decision makers to the lower level decision makers because the objectives obtained by the bi level multi objective model is closer to those of the upper level decision maker zhang et al 2019 4 the objective function values of the proposed model are the middle values of the objective function values of other models and the reason for this result is that the model considers the bi level multi objective programming and wonder nexus 6 conclusions in this study a novel optimization framework is developed by introducing ecological satisfaction degree irrigation priority and food nutritional value from the perspective of wonder nexus and integrating bi level multi objective programming and fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming the contributions of this framework are 1 quantifying the complex interconnections of wonder nexus 2 proposing a method for determining irrigation priority in arid irrigation areas obtaining priority ranking of different dmus by rsei and topsis 3 constructing an ecological satisfaction degree index to characterize the degree of achievement of ecological objectives set for irrigation districts 4 generating sustainable agricultural water and ecological water allocation schemes in addition the framework is able to deal with dual uncertainty fuzzy interval set parameters variables and different decision making bodies preferences the framework is applied to the agricultural and ecological water allocation in hongyashan irrigation district and the results show that 1 the irrigation priority is dmu 10 0 900 dmu 9 0 889 dmu 4 0 784 dmu 5 0 780 dmu 1 0 764 dmu 11 0 645 dmu 6 0 556 dmu 8 0 378 dmu 7 0 265 dmu 2 0 134 dmu 3 0 029 2 as the credibility level increases the decrease in surface water availability leads to a decrease in the value of each objective when the credibility level is 1 0 the system benefit is 16 18 18 47 10 8 y u a n the ecological satisfaction is 38 02 42 73 the nutritional water productivity is 1675 72 1716 41 kcal m3 the economic benefit is 14 05 15 77 10 8 y u a n and the crop yield is 1 89 2 24 10 8 k g 3 the ratio of water allocation for agriculture to ecology in the irrigation district is about 3 1 which is consistent with the characteristics of water use in the study area and the increase of credibility level will lead to the decrease of water allocation for agriculture and ecology 4 the total water allocation for different crops is mainly determined by the crop area specifically the water allocation of different crops is sunflower maize wheat seed melon the bi level multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming model established in this study can well coordinate the upper and lower decision makers and multiple decision objectives contained in each level and can obtain the optimal water allocation strategy of agricultural and ecological water resources based on different risk scenarios under wonder nexus and the model can be integrated with practical operations to provide decision support for agricultural and ecological management in arid areas this study is equally applicable to other purposes of water use including urban and industrial water by analyzing specific problems of urban and industrial water use under wonder nexus to formulate the optimization model with the corresponding formulas and

time large reservoirs inflow and outflow and hydrological model 2 estimation of hydrological drought characteristics including duration severity peak intensity instantaneous development speed and instantaneous recovery speed and drought propagation characteristics such as correlation transition rate and three types of the propagation time pt based on the start point pts peak point ptp and end point pte 3 quantification of the influences of various factors on the characteristic variables the upper yellow river basin a cold basin with large cascade reservoirs was selected as the study area to utilize the proposed framework the results revealed that climate change and large reservoirs reduced the duration and severity of drought events with relative contribution rates ranging from 146 6 to 340 2 and 381 to 707 7 respectively while those were increased by human activities with relative contribution rates from 428 0 to 1147 9 large reservoirs played the most crucial role in the development and recovery stages with relative contribution rates of 75 and 85 respectively climate change strengthened the correlation between the two drought indices while human activities and large reservoirs weakened the correlation the changes in three pt indicated that climate change shortened drought development and recovery period while those were prolonged by human activities many hydrological droughts occurred before meteorological droughts due to large reservoir regulations the changes in transition rates are 30 3 48 0 and 28 under the influences of climate change human activities and large reservoirs respectively the framework and results of this study provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of hydrological drought and drought propagation and serve as a scientific basis for drought mitigation in changing environments keywords hydrological drought drought propagation attribution analysis climate change human activity large reservoirs data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction drought occurs frequently affecting agriculture the social economy and the ecological environment in the context of global warming he et al 2017 van loon and van lanen 2013 generally drought can be classified as meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socio economic drought mishra and singh 2010 the different types of droughts are interrelated via the water cycle among them hydrological drought manifesting characterized by lower streamflow or water level than a normal state poses a threat to the supply of agriculture industry and domestic water and makes water resource management more challenging jiang et al 2019 van loon 2015 consequently hydrological drought is always a hot issue for scholars recent studies on hydrological drought can be classified into two categories the first category focused on the evolution of hydrological drought these studies explored the variations of drought duration severity and peak intensity and quantified the drought risk abdelkader and yerdelen 2022 hammond et al 2022 lin et al 2017 vlach et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 with the continuing understanding of hydrological drought mechanisms researchers have further divided a drought event into two stages i e development and recovery providing more insights for drought analysis bhardwaj et al 2020 das et al 2022 wu et al 2018 xu et al 2022 for example wu et al 2018 proposed the calculation of instantaneous propagation speed in the development and recovery stages to explore the internal propagation processes of hydrological drought the second category involves revealing the translation process from meteorological drought to hydrological drought i e external drought propagation these studies mainly focused on the propagation time pt which reflects the propagation speed from meteorological drought to hydrological drought in the past the pt was almost all determined by correlation analysis ding et al 2021 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2022d however the wet information in the drought index series was not excluded before correlation analysis leading to uncertainties in pt shi et al 2022 indicated that the correlation analysis was overused in the drought propagation study and highlighted the necessity of causality analysis wu et al 2021a compared three pt calculation methods based on correlation analysis run theory and non linear relationships they recommended the run theory based approach rather than the correlation analysis based approach therefore it is necessary to re examine the issues related to hydrological drought evolution and drought propagation from a multi stage and causal perspective moreover in recent decades human activities have significantly altered streamflow variations guo et al 2023 which further affect the hydrological drought variations and drought propagation patterns large reservoirs have become the dominant anthropic factor that affected streamflow variations with the increase in total storage capacity lian et al 2020 zhang et al 2022b requiring an improved understanding of the impact of changing environments on hydrological drought processes nevertheless the hydrological drought was generally regarded as a natural process in previous studies ignoring the impact of human activity xing et al 2021 recently several studies have noted the important roles of human activities and large reservoirs in hydrological drought evolution and tried to quantify their contributions the adopted methods can be summarized into five categories 1 the regulated unregulated comparison method tu et al 2018 wu et al 2021b 2 the upstream downstream comparison method rangecroft et al 2019 xing et al 2021 3 the paired catchment comparison method li et al 2021a van loon et al 2019 wang et al 2021 4 the pre post disturbance comparison method guo et al 2021 huang et al 2021 liu et al 2016 xu et al 2019 5 the observed simulated comparison method jiang et al 2019 li et al 2013 omer et al 2020 wu et al 2019 xu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022d table 1 lists these methods and their advantages and disadvantages among the various methods the pre post disturbance comparison method and the observed simulated comparison method are the most frequently employed due to their ease of use for instance xu et al 2019 found human activities could both shorten and prolong the pt in the luanhe river basin guo et al 2021 indicated that the mega reservoir improved the watershed drought tolerance huang et al 2021 revealed that the operation of the three gorges dam alleviated the speed of drought propagation these studies compared characteristic variables before and after a specific time to attribute hydrological drought evolution and propagation belonging to the pre post disturbance comparison method however following this idea ignoring the influences of climate change can cause uncertainty in the results several studies adopted the observed simulated comparison method to identify the effects of large reservoirs for example li et al 2013 used a hydrological model to simulate natural hydrological drought evolution and analyzed the influence of the three gorges dam yuan et al 2022 revealed the influence of cascade reservoirs in the upper mekong river on hydrological drought following a similar idea based on a deep learning model notably the simulated natural hydrological drought conditions exclude all types of anthropogenic impact undeniably large reservoir is one of the greatest anthropogenic factors that disturb runoff changes but it cannot be equated with human activities the influences of human activities and large reservoirs were confused in these studies the current methods cannot reveal the relative contribution of climate change large reservoirs and other human activities to the hydrological drought evolution consequently it is necessary to propose a more scientific approach to quantifying the contributions of different factors to hydrological drought a possible idea is to integrate these comparison methods as described above the main objectives of this study were to 1 re examine the hydrological drought evolution and drought propagation characteristics based on a more comprehensive and causal perspective and 2 to propose a more scientific framework to quantify the contribution of climate change human activities excluding large reservoirs and large reservoirs the remainder of this paper is organized as follows sect 2 introduces the study area and data used sect 3 present the framework and methods of this study sect 4 and sect 5 provide the key results and discussion and sect 6 summarizes the main conclusions generated from this study the findings can improve the understanding of hydrological drought mechanisms in a changing environment and provide the scientific basis for decision makers to mitigate drought 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the upper yellow river basin uyrb located in northwest china is the main water yield region of the yellow river basin accounting for more than 50 runoff of the whole basin the watershed above the lanzhou lz station covering a total area of 222 551 km2 was selected as the study area fig 1 the annual average precipitation and temperature in the uyrb are 446 mm and 0 89 c respectively approximately 60 of the annual runoff occurs during the flood season from july to october since the 1960 s three large i type reservoirs defined as a reservoir with a total capacity of more than 1 109 m3 i e liujiaxia longyangxia and lijiaxia reservoirs were successively constructed which significantly disturbed the streamflow variations since the large runoff of the uyrb a hydrological drought at lz station can seriously threaten the water supply in the downstream region 2 2 data in this study the observed monthly streamflow data of the lz gauge from 1934 to 2012 was collected from the hydrological yearbook of the yellow river basin the monthly inflow and outflow of the three large reservoirs including longyangxia 1987 2012 lijiaxia 1997 2010 and liujiaxia 1969 2012 reservoirs were collected from the huanghe hydropower development co ltd and yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources https www yrcc gov cn bai et al 2015 the monthly potential evaporation data during 1961 2012 estimated by the penman monteith equation was provided by zhang et al 2022a the monthly precipitation and temperature data were obtained from the 1 km monthly temperature and precipitation dataset for china provided by peng et al 2019 3 methods the current study aims to investigate the impacts of climate change human activities and large reservoirs on hydrological drought and drought propagation fig 2 exhibits the flowchart of this study showing three steps i e streamflow data preparation drought analysis and quantitative analysis the next parts present a detailed description of the related approaches 3 1 double mass curve the double mass curve dmc method is a simple and effective method for checking the stationary relationship between streamflow and precipitation searcy and hardison 1960 generally the inflection points in the plot of cumulative precipitation and streamflow indicate that the streamflow starts to be influenced by human activities here the critical time of human disturbance was comprehensively identified by the dmc and the records of actual human activity the streamflow before and after the critical time can be regarded as affected by only climatic factors and both climatic and anthropic factors 3 2 streamflow reconstruction in this framework four types of streamflow corresponding to different scenarios are required the abbreviations c1 and c2 denote the impacts of climatic factors during the baseline and distribution periods respectively and the abbreviations ri and hi represent the impacts of large reservoirs and human activities excluding large reservoirs respectively a detailed description is as follows scenario 1 the streamflow during the baseline period qc1 was only impacted by climatic factors scenario 2 the natural streamflow during the disruption period was only impacted by climatic factors qc2 it can be obtained by using a hydrological model the model parameters calibration requires the meteorological data and streamflow data during the undisrupted period then the natural streamflow can be simulated by using the model and meteorological data during the disturbance period here we adopted the improved abcd model that integrated a snow module showing good performance in streamflow simulation zhang et al 2022c thomas 1981 scenario 3 the streamflow is influenced by climate change and human activities during the disruption period qc2 hi notably the term human activities in the subsequent section refers to human activities apart from large reservoir regulation it can be calculated as follows 1 q c 2 h i q obs q in q out where the qc2 hi and qobs denote the uninfluenced and influenced streamflow by reservoirs respectively and the qin and qout are the inflow and outflow of large reservoirs scenario 4 the streamflow influenced by climate change human activities and large reservoirs qc2 hi ri i e the observed streamflow during the disruption period 3 3 drought assessment and identification in the current study the ssi and spi were adopted to quantify the intensity of hydrological drought and meteorological drought respectively mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2012 these drought indices are popular for drought evaluation due to their simple calculation and flexibility for ssi the streamflow series were firstly fitted using a specific cumulative distribution function and then to normalize the corresponding cumulative probability density to calculate index values the log normal distribution was used to fit the streamflow series in the current study because its fitting ability in the study area was proved in our previous work zhang et al 2022c the spi follows similar calculations but applied gamma distribution to fit the precipitation series the index values located in the interval 1 0 5 1 5 1 2 1 5 and 2 represent slight drought d1 moderate drought d2 serious drought d3 and extreme drought d4 respectively notably to identify the influence of different factors on hydrological drought we utilized a parameter transplant method proposed by jiang et al 2019 to estimate four ssi series the parameter of log normal distribution was only computed by using the natural streamflow from 1934 to 2012 i e qc1 and qc2 after this procedure a specific value in the four ssi sequences has the same mapped streamflow value namely the drought identification criteria are the same across four streamflow series the anthropogenic reduction and increase in streamflow will result in lower and higher ssi values respectively moreover the run theory developed by yevjevich 1967 was used to identify drought events fig 3 exhibits a diagram of run theory and three characteristic variables such as duration d severity s and peak intensity pi in this study the threshold of 0 5 x0 was used to identify the start and end times of a drought event event 1 besides the drought events lasting for only one month were also identified when their severity was greater than 1 5 x1 event 3 two events were combined when they were separated by only one month and the corresponding index value for that month was less than 1 5 x2 event 2 the duration equaled the sum of durations for two sub events plus one month 3 4 drought propagation analysis drought propagation can be categorized as internal and external propagation the internal propagation represents the development and recovery process of a specific type of drought while the external propagation reflects the responses between different types of drought for the internal propagation of hydrological drought an event was divided into development and recovery stages to identify the instantaneous development speed ids and instantaneous recovery speed irs fig 3 here following the approaches developed by wu et al 2018 the period between the start and peak point of an event is the development stage while the period between the end and peak point of an event denotes the recovery stage the total variation of the development period tvdp and total variation of the recovery period tvdr denote the total changes in ssi values during the development and recovery stages respectively after dividing the development and recovery stages into multiple intervals i 1 2 n respectively the ids and irs at each interval can be computed as 2 ids t i δ t v d p i δ t i i r s t i δ t v r p i δ t i after this step the average values of ids ti and irs ti can be applied to describe the ids and irs of a drought event for external drought propagation we focused on three indicators including correlation coefficient propagation time pt and transition rate tr to explore the response of hydrological drought to meteorological drought the correlation reflects the consistency of spi and ssi variations which can be quantified by the pearson correlation coefficient pcc the pcc between the ssi at 1 month scale and spi at 1 24 months scale were computed previous studies adopted the maximum pcc to determine the pt yet in the current study the pt was determined by the difference between the start time pts peak time ptp and end time pte of the paired drought events fig 4 to highlight the causality relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought the paired drought events are only identified when two types of drought events have overlapping occurrence times namely there are three types of pt which comprehensively reflect the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought in development and recovery stages the pt can be estimated as 3 p t s h s m s p t p h p m p p t e h e m e where hs hp and he are the start time peak time and end time of the hydrological drought event respectively and ms mp and me denote the start time peak time and end time of the meteorological drought event respectively notably following this idea the pt is permitted to be less than 0 meaning that a hydrological drought occurs before a meteorological drought in contrast to the correlation analysis based method the pt was calculated using the difference between three key times of the paired drought events without incorporating any wet information generally meteorological drought is the main cause of the hydrological drought however meteorological drought cannot always trigger hydrological drought due to the complex interaction of the hydrological cycle and human activities therefore the tr defined as the ratio between the number of meteorological drought events triggering hydrological drought nm h and the number of all meteorological drought events nm can be estimated as 4 t r n m h n m 100 3 5 attribution analysis by comparing the hydrological drought and drought propagation characteristics between different scenarios the impacts of different factors can be concluded the differences between scenarios 1 and 4 can be regarded as the integrated effects of climate change human activities and large reservoirs which have been confused in previous studies the differences between scenarios 1 and 2 i e pre post disturbance comparison scenarios 2 and 3 i e observed simulated comparison and scenarios 3 and 4 i e regulated unregulated comparison denote the influences of climate change human activities and large reservoir regulation the contribution of different factors can be calculated as 6 δ total δ c δ hi δ ri δ c v a r c 2 v a r c 1 δ hi v a r c 2 h i v a r c 2 δ ri v a r c 2 h i r i v a r c 2 h i where the δtotal δc δhi and δri denote the changes in drought characteristics caused by the compound and individual impacts of climate change human activities and large reservoirs respectively the varc1 varc2 varc2 hi and varc2 hi ri refer to the average values of drought characteristics variables under different scenarios then the relative contribution rates of different factors can be calculated as 7 η c δ c δ total 100 η hi δ hi δ total 100 η ri δ ri δ total 100 where the η c η hi and η ri are relative contribution rates of climate change human activities and large reservoirs respectively 4 results 4 1 streamflow reconstruction firstly the dmc was adopted to analyze the relationships between precipitation and streamflow from 1934 to 2012 and the results were exhibited in fig 5 two inflection points can be observed in 1969 and 1987 indicating that the relationships between precipitation and streamflow were altered the liujiaxia reservoir and longyangxia reservoirs beginning to store water in october 1968 and october 1986 respectively are recognized as the main factors influencing runoff changes in the uyrb su et al 2021 the liujiaxia reservoir only has the annual regulation ability the abrupt point in 1969 is therefore not obvious in the dmc diagram reflecting the relationship between annual precipitation and streamflow but the liujiaxia reservoir did significantly affect the variations of downstream monthly runoff according to the inflow and outflow records thus 1969 was determined as the critical time for the next analysis the observed streamflow during the period of 1934 1968 represents the streamflow only influenced by climatic factors qc1 while that during 1969 2012 was comprehensively influenced by climate change human activities and large reservoirs qc2 hi ri the meteorological data and streamflow data from 1961 to 1968 were used to test hydrological model performance fig 6 shows a visual comparison of simulated and observed streamflow during the calibration and validation period both the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 are greater than 0 75 and the values of percent bias pb are less than 10 the model has a very great performance in streamflow simulation according to the evaluation criteria recommended by moriasi et al 2007 then the model was further adopted to simulate natural streamflow during 1969 2012 which represents the streamflow only impacted by climate change qc2 after integrating the qc2 hi ri and reservoir inflow and outflow data the un regulated streamflow series representing the streamflow without the impacts of reservoirs qc2 hi can be obtained 4 2 comparison of hydrological drought characteristics and inner propagation fig 7 illustrates the grades of hydrological drought from 1934 to 2012 generally under the natural scenario hydrological drought showed a lower frequency and lighter intensity from 1969 to 2012 compared to those during 1934 1968 suggesting that hydrological drought was mitigated by climate change fig 7 a b meanwhile human activities caused more frequent and extreme drought conditions particularly after 1990 which was linked to heightened water consumption fig 7 c under the regulation of large reservoirs hydrological drought was rare from december to next may but frequently occurred in flood season fig 7 d further investigation into the effects of various factors on hydrological drought events characteristics including the duration d severity s peak intensity pi instantaneous development speed ids and instantaneous recovery speed irs under different scenarios are shown in fig 8 under the influence of climate change the average d s and pi decreased from 7 1 to 4 8 9 to 3 7 and 1 7 to 1 4 respectively under the combined influence of human activities and climate change the d s and pi were 5 10 4 and 3 respectively notably excluding the large reservoir impacts caused an increase in d and s to 13 and 21 1 respectively while pi decreased to 2 7 for ids and irs under different scenarios their relationships were similar to those of s but the ids was generally larger than irs overall the impacts of both climate change and anthropic factors on hydrological drought characteristics are significant and these impacts cannot be ignored table 2 lists the changes in hydrological drought characteristics caused by different factors and corresponding relative contribution rates as compared to 1934 1968 the d was reduced by 2 09 but s pi ids and irs all increased by 1 51 1 31 0 50 and 0 80 during 1969 2012 respectively among them climate change caused lower d s pi ids and irs with a range between 0 37 and 0 24 while human activities aggravated the average values of these characteristics with a range from 0 73 to 17 39 notably large reservoirs reduced the d and s but increased pi ids and irs according to relative contribution rates human activities were the main factors causing an increase in d and s with contribution rates of 428 and 1147 9 respectively while climate change and large reservoirs reduced the drought risks for pi the contributions of human activities were much greater than climate change and reservoirs indicating that pi variations were mainly related to human water withdrawals the large reservoir is the dominant factor affecting ids and irs with relative contribution rates of 80 and 75 respectively 4 3 comparison of external drought propagation characteristics to investigate the relationship between two types of drought the correlation analysis between ssi1 and spin 1 to 24 months scale was performed shown in fig 9 it can be observed that both climatic and anthropic factors have noticeable influences specifically the pcc of scenario 2 is higher than those of scenario 1 while the pcc of scenario 3 is lower than those of scenario 2 suggesting that climate change and human activities strengthened and weakened the linkages between the two types of droughts respectively moreover the correlation coefficients plunge to a range between 0 15 and 0 32 under large reservoir regulation which highlights the dominant role of reservoirs in drought propagation fig 10 presents the three types of pt obtained from matched drought events under different scenarios the median values for pts under four scenarios are 0 1 0 and 0 5 months respectively while those for ptp are 1 1 3 and 0 months these results indicated that climate change and human activities made hydrological droughts occur faster and slower respectively when the meteorological drought occurred and human activities and large reservoirs delayed and advanced the occurrence time of peak intensity of hydrological drought respectively for pte its median values under four scenarios are 2 1 4 and 1 month respectively the climate change and large reservoirs led to an earlier end of hydrological drought while human activities prolonged the drought duration notably several hydrological drought events started before the meteorological drought i e pts less than zero bruno et al 2022 showed that few studies explored the influence of subsurface storage change and actual evapotranspiration on drought propagation according to the water balance equation the high actual evapotranspiration and low subsurface storage make it difficult for precipitation to generate runoff in this case hydrological drought may occur even without precipitation deficits besides anthropogenic factors changed the start time of hydrological drought for instance water storage of the reservoirs caused the hydrological drought that should have occurred in september to occur in july instead these factors lead to negative values of pts indicating that drought propagation becomes more complicated in changing environments the tr was calculated to further explain the propagation between meteorological and hydrological drought listed in table 3 impacted by climate change the tr decreased from 58 3 to 28 0 indicating that climate change weakened the relationship between the two types of droughts human activities increased the frequency of hydrological drought and significantly enhanced the tr by 76 0 after being regulated by larger reservoirs the tr declined to 48 0 suggesting that large reservoirs undermined the linkages between meteorological and hydrological drought 5 discussion this study re examines the hydrological drought evolution and propagation from a more comprehensive perspective and proposed a framework to quantify the influence of climate change human activities and large reservoirs the framework addresses the issues of neglected climate change impacts and confusion between human activities and reservoir impacts in the previous study 5 1 effects of climate change climate change mitigated hydrological drought in the uyrb reflected in the lower drought frequency d s and pi fig 7 b fig 8 the relative contribution rates of climate change on the decreased d increased s and increased pi are 146 6 340 2 and 21 1 respectively table 2 therefore the impacts of human activities on hydrological drought may be underestimated when ignoring the climate change impacts guo et al 2021 tried to prove the little impacts of climate change on hydrological drought by comparing the annual average precipitation between different periods notably drought represents an extreme phenomenon the little difference in the annual average precipitation is thereby not sufficient to demonstrate the small effect of climate change zhang et al 2022e summarized the influence of climate types seasonality and anomalies of meteorological variables on drought propagation for cold watersheds like the uyrb their runoff components are diverse wu et al 2022 reported that both the annual precipitation and temperature of the uyrb showed increased trends in the past few decades as illustrated by li et al 2021b the increasing runoff in the uyrb could be well explained by precipitation and snow depth on the one hand the increased precipitation can produce more runoff i e rainfall runoff on the other hand the increased temperature enhances the melting of snow to produce more snow runoff which can effectively mitigate hydrological drought the decreasing tr from 58 3 to 28 0 suggests that climate change makes meteorological drought more difficult to trigger hydrological drought which may relate to the seasonal variation of snowmelt runoff caused by rising temperature differently the rising temperature can lead to more actual evapotranspiration and less streamflow recharge larbi et al 2022 which may also increase the hydrological drought frequency therefore the effects of climate change cannot be ignored in the attribution analysis of hydrological drought evolution especially in the context of increasing global warming 5 2 effects of human activities according to recent studies human activities were found to be the primary contributor to the intensification of hydrological drought yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2022d these human activities such as land use type change and water withdrawals for irrigation consumption domestic water supply and industrial consumption altered the streamflow in the river the annual average water withdrawal of a water diversion project in the uyrb was 224 million cubic meters showing an increasing trend from 1997 to 2009 fig 11 the increased water demand associated with population growth and economic development further reduced the streamflow which exacerbated the s d and pi of hydrological drought events fig 8 cheng et al 2021 suggested that non irrigation irrigation water use both exaggerated streamflow deficit based on pcr globwb model van loon et al 2022 discovered that all drought characteristics in 28 areas around the world were aggravated by water abstraction moreover our findings indicate that human activities have a much greater impact on the evolution of hydrological drought than climate change table 2 the prolonged state of drought in the uyrb can be regarded as human induced drought and human modified drought fig 7 c van loon et al 2016 as a result the meteorological drought can easily trigger hydrological drought table 3 5 3 effects of large reservoirs large reservoirs generally involve the reduction of flow during the flood season and an increase in flow during the dry season to meet the water demands as shown in fig 12 the longyangxia and lijiaxia reservoirs also followed these operating rules which significantly reduced the runoff at lz during the flood season since the application of parameter transplant method for ssi calculations water storage and release by reservoirs can cause lower and higher ssi values compared to the natural scenario respectively these frequent hydrological droughts caused by reservoir storage water also belongs to human induced drought van loon et al 2016 hydrological drought events lasting for long periods would be terminated at the end of the flood season of the large reservoir regulation fig 7 d which caused a decreased d and s but an increased number of drought events fig 8 this result is consistent with previous studies i e reservoirs supplying water during dry periods can effectively mitigate hydrological drought wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022d meteorological droughts occurring in the dry season are less likely to trigger hydrological drought while those occurring during the flood season can easily lead to such droughts the large regulating ability of the reservoirs in the uyrb is more effective in mitigating drought compared to the impact of climate change table 2 the optimal scheduling of reservoirs is therefore an effective way to mitigate the drought problems caused by climate change large reservoirs dramatically reduced the three types of pt showing that large reservoirs are the main factor influencing the drought propagation process fig 10 it should be noted that reservoirs can also exacerbate the severity and duration of droughts as shown by studies conducted lópez moreno et al 2009 xing et al 2021 highlighting the negative effect of reservoirs as such it is necessary to consider the influences of various reservoir regulations on the hydrological drought evolution 5 4 uncertainties and limitations it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the presented framework for attributing hydrological drought evolution although the adopted hydrological model showed very good performance fig 6 it still inevitably introduced uncertainties in natural streamflow simulation which may result in uncertainties in the contribution rates since it is difficult to obtain the real natural streamflow integrating multiple hydrological models may be an effective approach besides the impacts of human water withdrawals and land use cover change cannot be separated in the current framework a recent study indicated that land use cover change also altered the characteristics of hydrological drought omer et al 2021 therefore the refinement of the impact of different human activities remains a future goal 6 conclusion in this study we developed a framework to quantify the effects of climate change large reservoirs and other human activities on hydrological drought evolution and drought propagation the framework integrates multiple comparison methods addressing the ignoring climate change effect and confusion in the effect of large reservoirs and human activities in previous studies which is the innovation of this study the framework was applied in the upper yellow river basin the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 we found that climate change mitigated hydrological drought with average decreases of 3 07 5 15 0 28 0 24 and 1 05 of duration severity peak intensity instantaneous development speed and instantaneous recovery speed respectively while human activities exaggerated those characteristics with average increases of 8 96 17 39 1 26 0 73 and 2 04 respectively large reservoirs caused lower duration and severity and higher peak intensity instantaneous development speed and instantaneous recovery speed when climate change effects are not considered the exacerbating effect of human activities and the mitigating effect of large reservoirs on hydrological drought can be underestimated and overestimated respectively 2 climate change increased the correlation between spi and ssi while that was reduced by human activities and large reservoirs according to multiple comparisons the decreased transition rate under various scenarios indicates that climate change and large reservoirs prevent the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought while human activities do the reverse 3 climate change reduced the overlap time between meteorological and hydrological drought reflected in the median values of increased pts and decreased pte with 1 month human activities shortened the pts by 1 month but extended pts and pts by 2 and 3 months which made hydrological drought develop longer and required more time to recover the large reservoirs reduced the pts pts and pts by 0 5 3 and 3 months respectively hydrological droughts started before meteorological droughts since a weaker causal relationship between the two types of droughts caused by large reservoirs 4 according to the contribution rates human activities have the greatest impact on hydrological drought evolution and drought propagation followed by large reservoirs and climate change overall the current study clarified the roles of climate change large reservoirs and human activities in hydrological drought evolution and drought propagation the results improve the understanding of the hydrological drought mechanisms in a changing environment which can help drought risk management in the context of climate change and frequent human activity notably the proposed framework can be also applied in other watersheds credit authorship contribution statement te zhang conceptualization methodology writing original draft

1852,enhancing the comprehension of hydrological drought evolution and drought propagation mechanisms is crucial for effective drought risk management in a changing environment previous studies have either inadequately considered the effects of climate change or conflated the impacts of large reservoirs and human activities this study presents a comprehensive framework that integrates multiple comparison methods to quantify the effects of climate change large reservoirs and other human activities the framework comprises three steps 1 preparation of four types of streamflow based on critical time large reservoirs inflow and outflow and hydrological model 2 estimation of hydrological drought characteristics including duration severity peak intensity instantaneous development speed and instantaneous recovery speed and drought propagation characteristics such as correlation transition rate and three types of the propagation time pt based on the start point pts peak point ptp and end point pte 3 quantification of the influences of various factors on the characteristic variables the upper yellow river basin a cold basin with large cascade reservoirs was selected as the study area to utilize the proposed framework the results revealed that climate change and large reservoirs reduced the duration and severity of drought events with relative contribution rates ranging from 146 6 to 340 2 and 381 to 707 7 respectively while those were increased by human activities with relative contribution rates from 428 0 to 1147 9 large reservoirs played the most crucial role in the development and recovery stages with relative contribution rates of 75 and 85 respectively climate change strengthened the correlation between the two drought indices while human activities and large reservoirs weakened the correlation the changes in three pt indicated that climate change shortened drought development and recovery period while those were prolonged by human activities many hydrological droughts occurred before meteorological droughts due to large reservoir regulations the changes in transition rates are 30 3 48 0 and 28 under the influences of climate change human activities and large reservoirs respectively the framework and results of this study provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of hydrological drought and drought propagation and serve as a scientific basis for drought mitigation in changing environments keywords hydrological drought drought propagation attribution analysis climate change human activity large reservoirs data availability

different types of droughts are interrelated via the water cycle among them hydrological drought manifesting characterized by lower streamflow or water level than a normal state poses a threat to the supply of agriculture industry and domestic water and makes water resource management more challenging jiang et al 2019 van loon 2015 consequently hydrological drought is always a hot issue for scholars recent studies on hydrological drought can be classified into two categories the first category focused on the evolution of hydrological drought these studies explored the variations of drought duration severity and peak intensity and quantified the drought risk abdelkader and yerdelen 2022 hammond et al 2022 lin et al 2017 vlach et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 with the continuing understanding of hydrological drought mechanisms researchers have further divided a drought event into two stages i e development and recovery providing more insights for drought analysis bhardwaj et al 2020 das et al 2022 wu et al 2018 xu et al 2022 for example wu et al 2018 proposed the calculation of instantaneous propagation speed in the development and recovery stages to explore the internal propagation processes of hydrological drought the second category involves revealing the translation process from meteorological drought to hydrological drought i e external drought propagation these studies mainly focused on the propagation time pt which reflects the propagation speed from meteorological drought to hydrological drought in the past the pt was almost all determined by correlation analysis ding et al 2021 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2022d however the wet information in the drought index series was not excluded before correlation analysis leading to uncertainties in pt shi et al 2022 indicated that the correlation analysis was overused in the drought propagation study and highlighted the necessity of causality analysis wu et al 2021a compared three pt calculation methods based on correlation analysis run theory and non linear relationships they recommended the run theory based approach rather than the correlation analysis based approach therefore it is necessary to re examine the issues related to hydrological drought evolution and drought propagation from a multi stage and causal perspective moreover in recent decades human activities have significantly altered streamflow variations guo et al 2023 which further affect the hydrological drought variations and drought propagation patterns large reservoirs have become the dominant anthropic factor that affected streamflow variations with the increase in total storage capacity lian et al 2020 zhang et al 2022b requiring an improved understanding of the impact of changing environments on hydrological drought processes nevertheless the hydrological drought was generally regarded as a natural process in previous studies ignoring the impact of human activity xing et al 2021 recently several studies have noted the important roles of human activities and large reservoirs in hydrological drought evolution and tried to quantify their contributions the adopted methods can be summarized into five categories 1 the regulated unregulated comparison method tu et al 2018 wu et al 2021b 2 the upstream downstream comparison method rangecroft et al 2019 xing et al 2021 3 the paired catchment comparison method li et al 2021a van loon et al 2019 wang et al 2021 4 the pre post disturbance comparison method guo et al 2021 huang et al 2021 liu et al 2016 xu et al 2019 5 the observed simulated comparison method jiang et al 2019 li et al 2013 omer et al 2020 wu et al 2019 xu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022d table 1 lists these methods and their advantages and disadvantages among the various methods the pre post disturbance comparison method and the observed simulated comparison method are the most frequently employed due to their ease of use for instance xu et al 2019 found human activities could both shorten and prolong the pt in the luanhe river basin guo et al 2021 indicated that the mega reservoir improved the watershed drought tolerance huang et al 2021 revealed that the operation of the three gorges dam alleviated the speed of drought propagation these studies compared characteristic variables before and after a specific time to attribute hydrological drought evolution and propagation belonging to the pre post disturbance comparison method however following this idea ignoring the influences of climate change can cause uncertainty in the results several studies adopted the observed simulated comparison method to identify the effects of large reservoirs for example li et al 2013 used a hydrological model to simulate natural hydrological drought evolution and analyzed the influence of the three gorges dam yuan et al 2022 revealed the influence of cascade reservoirs in the upper mekong river on hydrological drought following a similar idea based on a deep learning model notably the simulated natural hydrological drought conditions exclude all types of anthropogenic impact undeniably large reservoir is one of the greatest anthropogenic factors that disturb runoff changes but it cannot be equated with human activities the influences of human activities and large reservoirs were confused in these studies the current methods cannot reveal the relative contribution of climate change large reservoirs and other human activities to the hydrological drought evolution consequently it is necessary to propose a more scientific approach to quantifying the contributions of different factors to hydrological drought a possible idea is to integrate these comparison methods as described above the main objectives of this study were to 1 re examine the hydrological drought evolution and drought propagation characteristics based on a more comprehensive and causal perspective and 2 to propose a more scientific framework to quantify the contribution of climate change human activities excluding large reservoirs and large reservoirs the remainder of this paper is organized as follows sect 2 introduces the study area and data used sect 3 present the framework and methods of this study sect 4 and sect 5 provide the key results and discussion and sect 6 summarizes the main conclusions generated from this study the findings can improve the understanding of hydrological drought mechanisms in a changing environment and provide the scientific basis for decision makers to mitigate drought 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the upper yellow river basin uyrb located in northwest china is the main water yield region of the yellow river basin accounting for more than 50 runoff of the whole basin the watershed above the lanzhou lz station covering a total area of 222 551 km2 was selected as the study area fig 1 the annual average precipitation and temperature in the uyrb are 446 mm and 0 89 c respectively approximately 60 of the annual runoff occurs during the flood season from july to october since the 1960 s three large i type reservoirs defined as a reservoir with a total capacity of more than 1 109 m3 i e liujiaxia longyangxia and lijiaxia reservoirs were successively constructed which significantly disturbed the streamflow variations since the large runoff of the uyrb a hydrological drought at lz station can seriously threaten the water supply in the downstream region 2 2 data in this study the observed monthly streamflow data of the lz gauge from 1934 to 2012 was collected from the hydrological yearbook of the yellow river basin the monthly inflow and outflow of the three large reservoirs including longyangxia 1987 2012 lijiaxia 1997 2010 and liujiaxia 1969 2012 reservoirs were collected from the huanghe hydropower development co ltd and yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources https www yrcc gov cn bai et al 2015 the monthly potential evaporation data during 1961 2012 estimated by the penman monteith equation was provided by zhang et al 2022a the monthly precipitation and temperature data were obtained from the 1 km monthly temperature and precipitation dataset for china provided by peng et al 2019 3 methods the current study aims to investigate the impacts of climate change human activities and large reservoirs on hydrological drought and drought propagation fig 2 exhibits the flowchart of this study showing three steps i e streamflow data preparation drought analysis and quantitative analysis the next parts present a detailed description of the related approaches 3 1 double mass curve the double mass curve dmc method is a simple and effective method for checking the stationary relationship between streamflow and precipitation searcy and hardison 1960 generally the inflection points in the plot of cumulative precipitation and streamflow indicate that the streamflow starts to be influenced by human activities here the critical time of human disturbance was comprehensively identified by the dmc and the records of actual human activity the streamflow before and after the critical time can be regarded as affected by only climatic factors and both climatic and anthropic factors 3 2 streamflow reconstruction in this framework four types of streamflow corresponding to different scenarios are required the abbreviations c1 and c2 denote the impacts of climatic factors during the baseline and distribution periods respectively and the abbreviations ri and hi represent the impacts of large reservoirs and human activities excluding large reservoirs respectively a detailed description is as follows scenario 1 the streamflow during the baseline period qc1 was only impacted by climatic factors scenario 2 the natural streamflow during the disruption period was only impacted by climatic factors qc2 it can be obtained by using a hydrological model the model parameters calibration requires the meteorological data and streamflow data during the undisrupted period then the natural streamflow can be simulated by using the model and meteorological data during the disturbance period here we adopted the improved abcd model that integrated a snow module showing good performance in streamflow simulation zhang et al 2022c thomas 1981 scenario 3 the streamflow is influenced by climate change and human activities during the disruption period qc2 hi notably the term human activities in the subsequent section refers to human activities apart from large reservoir regulation it can be calculated as follows 1 q c 2 h i q obs q in q out where the qc2 hi and qobs denote the uninfluenced and influenced streamflow by reservoirs respectively and the qin and qout are the inflow and outflow of large reservoirs scenario 4 the streamflow influenced by climate change human activities and large reservoirs qc2 hi ri i e the observed streamflow during the disruption period 3 3 drought assessment and identification in the current study the ssi and spi were adopted to quantify the intensity of hydrological drought and meteorological drought respectively mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2012 these drought indices are popular for drought evaluation due to their simple calculation and flexibility for ssi the streamflow series were firstly fitted using a specific cumulative distribution function and then to normalize the corresponding cumulative probability density to calculate index values the log normal distribution was used to fit the streamflow series in the current study because its fitting ability in the study area was proved in our previous work zhang et al 2022c the spi follows similar calculations but applied gamma distribution to fit the precipitation series the index values located in the interval 1 0 5 1 5 1 2 1 5 and 2 represent slight drought d1 moderate drought d2 serious drought d3 and extreme drought d4 respectively notably to identify the influence of different factors on hydrological drought we utilized a parameter transplant method proposed by jiang et al 2019 to estimate four ssi series the parameter of log normal distribution was only computed by using the natural streamflow from 1934 to 2012 i e qc1 and qc2 after this procedure a specific value in the four ssi sequences has the same mapped streamflow value namely the drought identification criteria are the same across four streamflow series the anthropogenic reduction and increase in streamflow will result in lower and higher ssi values respectively moreover the run theory developed by yevjevich 1967 was used to identify drought events fig 3 exhibits a diagram of run theory and three characteristic variables such as duration d severity s and peak intensity pi in this study the threshold of 0 5 x0 was used to identify the start and end times of a drought event event 1 besides the drought events lasting for only one month were also identified when their severity was greater than 1 5 x1 event 3 two events were combined when they were separated by only one month and the corresponding index value for that month was less than 1 5 x2 event 2 the duration equaled the sum of durations for two sub events plus one month 3 4 drought propagation analysis drought propagation can be categorized as internal and external propagation the internal propagation represents the development and recovery process of a specific type of drought while the external propagation reflects the responses between different types of drought for the internal propagation of hydrological drought an event was divided into development and recovery stages to identify the instantaneous development speed ids and instantaneous recovery speed irs fig 3 here following the approaches developed by wu et al 2018 the period between the start and peak point of an event is the development stage while the period between the end and peak point of an event denotes the recovery stage the total variation of the development period tvdp and total variation of the recovery period tvdr denote the total changes in ssi values during the development and recovery stages respectively after dividing the development and recovery stages into multiple intervals i 1 2 n respectively the ids and irs at each interval can be computed as 2 ids t i δ t v d p i δ t i i r s t i δ t v r p i δ t i after this step the average values of ids ti and irs ti can be applied to describe the ids and irs of a drought event for external drought propagation we focused on three indicators including correlation coefficient propagation time pt and transition rate tr to explore the response of hydrological drought to meteorological drought the correlation reflects the consistency of spi and ssi variations which can be quantified by the pearson correlation coefficient pcc the pcc between the ssi at 1 month scale and spi at 1 24 months scale were computed previous studies adopted the maximum pcc to determine the pt yet in the current study the pt was determined by the difference between the start time pts peak time ptp and end time pte of the paired drought events fig 4 to highlight the causality relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought the paired drought events are only identified when two types of drought events have overlapping occurrence times namely there are three types of pt which comprehensively reflect the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought in development and recovery stages the pt can be estimated as 3 p t s h s m s p t p h p m p p t e h e m e where hs hp and he are the start time peak time and end time of the hydrological drought event respectively and ms mp and me denote the start time peak time and end time of the meteorological drought event respectively notably following this idea the pt is permitted to be less than 0 meaning that a hydrological drought occurs before a meteorological drought in contrast to the correlation analysis based method the pt was calculated using the difference between three key times of the paired drought events without incorporating any wet information generally meteorological drought is the main cause of the hydrological drought however meteorological drought cannot always trigger hydrological drought due to the complex interaction of the hydrological cycle and human activities therefore the tr defined as the ratio between the number of meteorological drought events triggering hydrological drought nm h and the number of all meteorological drought events nm can be estimated as 4 t r n m h n m 100 3 5 attribution analysis by comparing the hydrological drought and drought propagation characteristics between different scenarios the impacts of different factors can be concluded the differences between scenarios 1 and 4 can be regarded as the integrated effects of climate change human activities and large reservoirs which have been confused in previous studies the differences between scenarios 1 and 2 i e pre post disturbance comparison scenarios 2 and 3 i e observed simulated comparison and scenarios 3 and 4 i e regulated unregulated comparison denote the influences of climate change human activities and large reservoir regulation the contribution of different factors can be calculated as 6 δ total δ c δ hi δ ri δ c v a r c 2 v a r c 1 δ hi v a r c 2 h i v a r c 2 δ ri v a r c 2 h i r i v a r c 2 h i where the δtotal δc δhi and δri denote the changes in drought characteristics caused by the compound and individual impacts of climate change human activities and large reservoirs respectively the varc1 varc2 varc2 hi and varc2 hi ri refer to the average values of drought characteristics variables under different scenarios then the relative contribution rates of different factors can be calculated as 7 η c δ c δ total 100 η hi δ hi δ total 100 η ri δ ri δ total 100 where the η c η hi and η ri are relative contribution rates of climate change human activities and large reservoirs respectively 4 results 4 1 streamflow reconstruction firstly the dmc was adopted to analyze the relationships between precipitation and streamflow from 1934 to 2012 and the results were exhibited in fig 5 two inflection points can be observed in 1969 and 1987 indicating that the relationships between precipitation and streamflow were altered the liujiaxia reservoir and longyangxia reservoirs beginning to store water in october 1968 and october 1986 respectively are recognized as the main factors influencing runoff changes in the uyrb su et al 2021 the liujiaxia reservoir only has the annual regulation ability the abrupt point in 1969 is therefore not obvious in the dmc diagram reflecting the relationship between annual precipitation and streamflow but the liujiaxia reservoir did significantly affect the variations of downstream monthly runoff according to the inflow and outflow records thus 1969 was determined as the critical time for the next analysis the observed streamflow during the period of 1934 1968 represents the streamflow only influenced by climatic factors qc1 while that during 1969 2012 was comprehensively influenced by climate change human activities and large reservoirs qc2 hi ri the meteorological data and streamflow data from 1961 to 1968 were used to test hydrological model performance fig 6 shows a visual comparison of simulated and observed streamflow during the calibration and validation period both the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 are greater than 0 75 and the values of percent bias pb are less than 10 the model has a very great performance in streamflow simulation according to the evaluation criteria recommended by moriasi et al 2007 then the model was further adopted to simulate natural streamflow during 1969 2012 which represents the streamflow only impacted by climate change qc2 after integrating the qc2 hi ri and reservoir inflow and outflow data the un regulated streamflow series representing the streamflow without the impacts of reservoirs qc2 hi can be obtained 4 2 comparison of hydrological drought characteristics and inner propagation fig 7 illustrates the grades of hydrological drought from 1934 to 2012 generally under the natural scenario hydrological drought showed a lower frequency and lighter intensity from 1969 to 2012 compared to those during 1934 1968 suggesting that hydrological drought was mitigated by climate change fig 7 a b meanwhile human activities caused more frequent and extreme drought conditions particularly after 1990 which was linked to heightened water consumption fig 7 c under the regulation of large reservoirs hydrological drought was rare from december to next may but frequently occurred in flood season fig 7 d further investigation into the effects of various factors on hydrological drought events characteristics including the duration d severity s peak intensity pi instantaneous development speed ids and instantaneous recovery speed irs under different scenarios are shown in fig 8 under the influence of climate change the average d s and pi decreased from 7 1 to 4 8 9 to 3 7 and 1 7 to 1 4 respectively under the combined influence of human activities and climate change the d s and pi were 5 10 4 and 3 respectively notably excluding the large reservoir impacts caused an increase in d and s to 13 and 21 1 respectively while pi decreased to 2 7 for ids and irs under different scenarios their relationships were similar to those of s but the ids was generally larger than irs overall the impacts of both climate change and anthropic factors on hydrological drought characteristics are significant and these impacts cannot be ignored table 2 lists the changes in hydrological drought characteristics caused by different factors and corresponding relative contribution rates as compared to 1934 1968 the d was reduced by 2 09 but s pi ids and irs all increased by 1 51 1 31 0 50 and 0 80 during 1969 2012 respectively among them climate change caused lower d s pi ids and irs with a range between 0 37 and 0 24 while human activities aggravated the average values of these characteristics with a range from 0 73 to 17 39 notably large reservoirs reduced the d and s but increased pi ids and irs according to relative contribution rates human activities were the main factors causing an increase in d and s with contribution rates of 428 and 1147 9 respectively while climate change and large reservoirs reduced the drought risks for pi the contributions of human activities were much greater than climate change and reservoirs indicating that pi variations were mainly related to human water withdrawals the large reservoir is the dominant factor affecting ids and irs with relative contribution rates of 80 and 75 respectively 4 3 comparison of external drought propagation characteristics to investigate the relationship between two types of drought the correlation analysis between ssi1 and spin 1 to 24 months scale was performed shown in fig 9 it can be observed that both climatic and anthropic factors have noticeable influences specifically the pcc of scenario 2 is higher than those of scenario 1 while the pcc of scenario 3 is lower than those of scenario 2 suggesting that climate change and human activities strengthened and weakened the linkages between the two types of droughts respectively moreover the correlation coefficients plunge to a range between 0 15 and 0 32 under large reservoir regulation which highlights the dominant role of reservoirs in drought propagation fig 10 presents the three types of pt obtained from matched drought events under different scenarios the median values for pts under four scenarios are 0 1 0 and 0 5 months respectively while those for ptp are 1 1 3 and 0 months these results indicated that climate change and human activities made hydrological droughts occur faster and slower respectively when the meteorological drought occurred and human activities and large reservoirs delayed and advanced the occurrence time of peak intensity of hydrological drought respectively for pte its median values under four scenarios are 2 1 4 and 1 month respectively the climate change and large reservoirs led to an earlier end of hydrological drought while human activities prolonged the drought duration notably several hydrological drought events started before the meteorological drought i e pts less than zero bruno et al 2022 showed that few studies explored the influence of subsurface storage change and actual evapotranspiration on drought propagation according to the water balance equation the high actual evapotranspiration and low subsurface storage make it difficult for precipitation to generate runoff in this case hydrological drought may occur even without precipitation deficits besides anthropogenic factors changed the start time of hydrological drought for instance water storage of the reservoirs caused the hydrological drought that should have occurred in september to occur in july instead these factors lead to negative values of pts indicating that drought propagation becomes more complicated in changing environments the tr was calculated to further explain the propagation between meteorological and hydrological drought listed in table 3 impacted by climate change the tr decreased from 58 3 to 28 0 indicating that climate change weakened the relationship between the two types of droughts human activities increased the frequency of hydrological drought and significantly enhanced the tr by 76 0 after being regulated by larger reservoirs the tr declined to 48 0 suggesting that large reservoirs undermined the linkages between meteorological and hydrological drought 5 discussion this study re examines the hydrological drought evolution and propagation from a more comprehensive perspective and proposed a framework to quantify the influence of climate change human activities and large reservoirs the framework addresses the issues of neglected climate change impacts and confusion between human activities and reservoir impacts in the previous study 5 1 effects of climate change climate change mitigated hydrological drought in the uyrb reflected in the lower drought frequency d s and pi fig 7 b fig 8 the relative contribution rates of climate change on the decreased d increased s and increased pi are 146 6 340 2 and 21 1 respectively table 2 therefore the impacts of human activities on hydrological drought may be underestimated when ignoring the climate change impacts guo et al 2021 tried to prove the little impacts of climate change on hydrological drought by comparing the annual average precipitation between different periods notably drought represents an extreme phenomenon the little difference in the annual average precipitation is thereby not sufficient to demonstrate the small effect of climate change zhang et al 2022e summarized the influence of climate types seasonality and anomalies of meteorological variables on drought propagation for cold watersheds like the uyrb their runoff components are diverse wu et al 2022 reported that both the annual precipitation and temperature of the uyrb showed increased trends in the past few decades as illustrated by li et al 2021b the increasing runoff in the uyrb could be well explained by precipitation and snow depth on the one hand the increased precipitation can produce more runoff i e rainfall runoff on the other hand the increased temperature enhances the melting of snow to produce more snow runoff which can effectively mitigate hydrological drought the decreasing tr from 58 3 to 28 0 suggests that climate change makes meteorological drought more difficult to trigger hydrological drought which may relate to the seasonal variation of snowmelt runoff caused by rising temperature differently the rising temperature can lead to more actual evapotranspiration and less streamflow recharge larbi et al 2022 which may also increase the hydrological drought frequency therefore the effects of climate change cannot be ignored in the attribution analysis of hydrological drought evolution especially in the context of increasing global warming 5 2 effects of human activities according to recent studies human activities were found to be the primary contributor to the intensification of hydrological drought yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2022d these human activities such as land use type change and water withdrawals for irrigation consumption domestic water supply and industrial consumption altered the streamflow in the river the annual average water withdrawal of a water diversion project in the uyrb was 224 million cubic meters showing an increasing trend from 1997 to 2009 fig 11 the increased water demand associated with population growth and economic development further reduced the streamflow which exacerbated the s d and pi of hydrological drought events fig 8 cheng et al 2021 suggested that non irrigation irrigation water use both exaggerated streamflow deficit based on pcr globwb model van loon et al 2022 discovered that all drought characteristics in 28 areas around the world were aggravated by water abstraction moreover our findings indicate that human activities have a much greater impact on the evolution of hydrological drought than climate change table 2 the prolonged state of drought in the uyrb can be regarded as human induced drought and human modified drought fig 7 c van loon et al 2016 as a result the meteorological drought can easily trigger hydrological drought table 3 5 3 effects of large reservoirs large reservoirs generally involve the reduction of flow during the flood season and an increase in flow during the dry season to meet the water demands as shown in fig 12 the longyangxia and lijiaxia reservoirs also followed these operating rules which significantly reduced the runoff at lz during the flood season since the application of parameter transplant method for ssi calculations water storage and release by reservoirs can cause lower and higher ssi values compared to the natural scenario respectively these frequent hydrological droughts caused by reservoir storage water also belongs to human induced drought van loon et al 2016 hydrological drought events lasting for long periods would be terminated at the end of the flood season of the large reservoir regulation fig 7 d which caused a decreased d and s but an increased number of drought events fig 8 this result is consistent with previous studies i e reservoirs supplying water during dry periods can effectively mitigate hydrological drought wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022d meteorological droughts occurring in the dry season are less likely to trigger hydrological drought while those occurring during the flood season can easily lead to such droughts the large regulating ability of the reservoirs in the uyrb is more effective in mitigating drought compared to the impact of climate change table 2 the optimal scheduling of reservoirs is therefore an effective way to mitigate the drought problems caused by climate change large reservoirs dramatically reduced the three types of pt showing that large reservoirs are the main factor influencing the drought propagation process fig 10 it should be noted that reservoirs can also exacerbate the severity and duration of droughts as shown by studies conducted lópez moreno et al 2009 xing et al 2021 highlighting the negative effect of reservoirs as such it is necessary to consider the influences of various reservoir regulations on the hydrological drought evolution 5 4 uncertainties and limitations it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the presented framework for attributing hydrological drought evolution although the adopted hydrological model showed very good performance fig 6 it still inevitably introduced uncertainties in natural streamflow simulation which may result in uncertainties in the contribution rates since it is difficult to obtain the real natural streamflow integrating multiple hydrological models may be an effective approach besides the impacts of human water withdrawals and land use cover change cannot be separated in the current framework a recent study indicated that land use cover change also altered the characteristics of hydrological drought omer et al 2021 therefore the refinement of the impact of different human activities remains a future goal 6 conclusion in this study we developed a framework to quantify the effects of climate change large reservoirs and other human activities on hydrological drought evolution and drought propagation the framework integrates multiple comparison methods addressing the ignoring climate change effect and confusion in the effect of large reservoirs and human activities in previous studies which is the innovation of this study the framework was applied in the upper yellow river basin the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 we found that climate change mitigated hydrological drought with average decreases of 3 07 5 15 0 28 0 24 and 1 05 of duration severity peak intensity instantaneous development speed and instantaneous recovery speed respectively while human activities exaggerated those characteristics with average increases of 8 96 17 39 1 26 0 73 and 2 04 respectively large reservoirs caused lower duration and severity and higher peak intensity instantaneous development speed and instantaneous recovery speed when climate change effects are not considered the exacerbating effect of human activities and the mitigating effect of large reservoirs on hydrological drought can be underestimated and overestimated respectively 2 climate change increased the correlation between spi and ssi while that was reduced by human activities and large reservoirs according to multiple comparisons the decreased transition rate under various scenarios indicates that climate change and large reservoirs prevent the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought while human activities do the reverse 3 climate change reduced the overlap time between meteorological and hydrological drought reflected in the median values of increased pts and decreased pte with 1 month human activities shortened the pts by 1 month but extended pts and pts by 2 and 3 months which made hydrological drought develop longer and required more time to recover the large reservoirs reduced the pts pts and pts by 0 5 3 and 3 months respectively hydrological droughts started before meteorological droughts since a weaker causal relationship between the two types of droughts caused by large reservoirs 4 according to the contribution rates human activities have the greatest impact on hydrological drought evolution and drought propagation followed by large reservoirs and climate change overall the current study clarified the roles of climate change large reservoirs and human activities in hydrological drought evolution and drought propagation the results improve the understanding of the hydrological drought mechanisms in a changing environment which can help drought risk management in the context of climate change and frequent human activity notably the proposed framework can be also applied in other watersheds credit authorship contribution statement te zhang conceptualization methodology writing original draft

1853,surface soil moisture ssm is a vital component in terrestrial hydrological processes as a type of important microwave remote sensing based ssm dataset the soil moisture active passive smap ssm data were available since 2015 and have been applied to many studies however the spatial gaps in the smap ssm data affect greatly its applicability to address this issue this study developed a method to fill the spatial gaps in the smap ssm data generating a spatially seamless daily smap ssd smap ssm dataset from 2015 to 2021 the method makes full use of the long smap ssm time series data with inherent spatial gaps to deal with the continuously changed spatial gaps in the daily smap data we used a highly comparative time series analysis hctsa to dig the temporal profiles of the smap ssm time series producing 17 seamless hctsa based time series characteristics htcs both spatially seamless topography characteristics tcs and location characteristics lcs were also considered moreover a random forest rf model was trained to construct the relation between the valid daily smap data at the prediction time and the seamless auxiliary data i e 17 htcs coupled with tcs and lcs subsequently the constructed rf model was migrated to fill the spatial gaps of the smap data at the corresponding time the proposed method was validated in both simulated gaps real data as reference and real gaps in situ ssm data as reference the produced ssd smap dataset was also compared with the model based global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam dataset the results indicated that the ssd smap data are closer to the in situ data with an unbiased root mean square error ubrmse of 0 040 m3 m3 the ssd smap dataset can provide data support for global and regional research in related fields keywords surface soil moisture ssm soil moisture active passive smap data reconstruction gap filling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface soil moisture ssm is a key hydrological indicator that has been widely applied to climate change guillod et al 2015 li et al 2022 drought monitoring zhou et al 2017 souza et al 2021 terrestrial carbon cycle wu et al 2020 humphrey et al 2021 and other studies currently three sources of ssm data are widely utilized including ground based observation dorigo et al 2011 model based assimilation e g the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2011 and microwave remote sensing based retrieval e g the soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 in general ground based observation of ssm has the optimal accuracy among the aforementioned sources of ssm data because of direct measurement without penetration of obstacles dorigo et al 2015 colliander et al 2017 thus ground based ssm data are usually used as references to validate model and remote sensing based ssm data zeng et al 2015 liu et al 2021 xu et al 2021 however the spatial distribution of ground based ssm data is sparse which limits its application at the global scale rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 conversely model based assimilation of ssm has complete spatial coverage which fits large scale studies well however model based ssm data require relatively complex assimilation processing and its accuracy depends on the quality of the assimilated inputs bi et al 2016 tavakol et al 2021 compared with the model based assimilation microwave remote sensing based retrieval can provide direct observations of ssm various satellites carrying different microwave sensors have been launched to acquire reliable and spatially continuous microwave remote sensing based ssm data liu et al 2011 babaeian et al 2019 long time series ssm products with a daily temporal resolution are available such as the smap chan et al

esa developed a merged method to generate the climate change initiative cci dorigo et al 2017 however due to the discontinuous coverage of the satellite orbits the aforementioned microwave remote sensing based ssm data have unavoidable spatial gaps long et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the smap ssm data for instance have approximately 25 to 60 missing this greatly affects the application therefore it is an urgent task to develop solutions to filling the missing smap ssm data with respect to the spatial gap filling of ssm data many driven factors extracted from other sensors were used as auxiliary data i e hereafter called heterologous auxiliary data based on multiple factors e g atmospheric forcings and static physiographic attributes fang et al 2017 developed a deep learning method to fill the gaps of the smap data in the continental united states likewise llamas et al 2020 utilized precipitation atmospheric temperature and soil texture combined with multiple regression models to fill spatial gaps in the cci data almendra martín et al 2021 reconstructed the cci data based on soil texture land surface temperature lst and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi using a support vector machine model however these driven factors e g lst and ndvi acquired by optical remote sensing technology are difficult to accomplish daily and spatially seamless global observation due to the orbit gaps and contamination of atmospheric conditions ma et al 2022 thus these heterologous auxiliary data are not directly suitable for gap filling of daily smap data at the global scale meanwhile the aforementioned methods for gap filling always depend on the fitting performance between the heterologous auxiliary data and known ssm data considering that the difference in physical meaning between variables heterologous auxiliary data and ssm usually unavoidably affect the post gap filling process the use of the ssm time series hereafter called homologous auxiliary data tends to be a preferable choice jiang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 yang et al 2022 guevara et al 2021 used inter annual mean values of cci for each pixel as the training data to develop a spatially seamless annual cci dataset at a spatial resolution of 15 km based on slow changing static variables including topography parameter bioclimatic and soil type however these methods sacrifice the fine temporal resolution of the ssm data to fully maintain the temporal resolution of the original ssm data the time series data were fused by zhang et al 2021 specifically the great complementarity of spatial coverage was adopted for the gap filling of amsr2 generating a global seamless daily amsr2 dataset from 2013 to 2019 according to the evaluation of different microwave remote sensing based ssm datasets the quality e g accuracy continuity and stability of the smap ssm dataset is generally more satisfactory than other ssm datasets at the global scale kim et al 2018 evaluated various ssm datasets including smap amsr2 and ascat and found that the smap dataset was the closest to ground based observations simultaneously the smap dataset displayed a higher signal to noise ratio than other ssm datasets based on triple collocation statistics kumar et al 2018 also demonstrated that the smap dataset had smaller errors than other ssm datasets including amsr e ascat smos and amsr2 based on information theory likewise ma et al 2019 concluded that the smap dataset was a more reliable choice in terms of capturing the dynamic change of ssm than amsr e amsr2 ascat and smos ma et al 2019 at a regional scale cui et al 2017 and wang et al 2021 showed that the smap dataset outperformed the smos in terms of accuracy and stability to take full advantage of smap it is of great significance to fill the gaps in the smap dataset and generate a spatially seamless daily smap ssd smap ssm dataset in general the model for filling missing data always needs to be constructed in an overlapping area with valid information of both the original and auxiliary data considering the continuous change of spatial gaps in daily smap data there exists a constant and dynamic loss of spatial coverage for smap time series thus it is difficult to construct a filling model based on the use of homologous smap time series directly in this paper a highly comparative time series analysis hctsa based method was proposed to deal with the continuous change of spatial gaps in smap time series data based on this method the spatially complete homologous characteristics can be extracted by the pattern of temporal changes in the smap data overcoming the effects of the missing values in the time series data in addition to the homologous smap time series data heterologous auxiliary data were also considered including topography characteristics tcs and location characteristics lcs topography can directly affect soil properties jenny 1941 mcbratney et al 2003 likewise location information reflects climate divisions and further distinguishes the pattern of temporal change in ssm peel et al 2007 wang et al 2022 to fully fit the complex relationship between the original smap data and various auxiliary data including homologous and heterologous a random forest rf model was developed owing to its great robustness and resistance to overfitting based on the proposed method we generated a ssd smap ssm dataset at the global scale from 2015 to 2021 two quantitative validations were conducted first the original smap data were selected as references to evaluate the simulated gaps that were filled using the proposed method second the available in situ data were divided into sparse and dense networks each network containing multiple in situ data to validate the ssd smap dataset the two major contributions of this study are summarized as follows 1 a hctsa based method was proposed to fill the widely existed gaps in the observed smap ssm time series the method makes full use of the homologous smap ssm time series and can deal with the continuously changed gaps across the temporal domain producing spatially seamless characteristics from the long smap time series facilitating modeling the relation between time series 2 a global daily and spatial seamless smap dataset ssd smap from 2015 to 2021 was generated through the developed method the ssd smap dataset has a reliable accuracy and can be applied to the dynamic monitoring of ssm and related studies at the global scale 2 data 2 1 smap ssm data the smap satellite carrying an l band active radar and a passive radiometer was launched in january 2015 by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa based on the different sensors three smap ssm datasets were retrieved at 3 km 9 km and 36 km spatial resolutions das et al 2014 montzka et al 2016 which are freely available from the national snow and ice data center nsidc https nsidc org daily smap data were available from 31 march 2015 including observations of the ascending and descending half orbits i e am and pm data zhao et al 2018 however the onboard l band active radar failed in july 2015 interrupting the acquisition of the original smap ssm data at a spatial resolution of 3 km and 9 km chan et al 2018 hence only original smap data at 36 km spatial resolution were generated continually excluding the post processed spl3smp e and spl2smap s in this paper the spatial gaps in the smap level 3 products version 8 were filled from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2021 we calculated the proportion of the original coverage based on the known smap data moreover the data acquired from both am and pm were composited by averaging both to maintain the stability of the smap data as shown in fig 1 it is observed that the proportion of the original coverage of the daily smap data is approximately 40 to 75 implying that daily ssm information with complete spatial coverage could not be directly acquired from the original smap data 2 2 in situ data the in situ data were measured by ground based sensors which recorded the dynamic changes in soil moisture at different depths escorihuela et al 2010 adams et al 2015 in this paper the in situ data acquired by the international soil moisture network ismn https ismn earth en were utilized to validate the different ssm datasets including the original smap ssd smap and gleam dorigo et al 2010 dorigo et al 2021 additionally two independent networks i e fort cobb and little washita in oklahoma state were also adopted for evaluation starks et al 2014 to match the depth of the ssm dataset the measured depths of the selected in situ data were not larger than 0 05 m the detailed information of the in situ data was provided in section 3 4 2 3 gleam data the gleam dataset https www gleam eu was derived by model based assimilation at 25 km spatial resolution based on various datasets e g the cci ssm dataset which was generated at the daily scale with global coverage miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 owing to its spatially seamless coverage and fine temporal resolution the gleam dataset is widely applied in many global soil moisture studies to avoid spatial gaps and coarse temporal resolution in this paper the gleam version 3 6a was used as the benchmark data and compared with the filled ssd smap dataset to maintain the consistency of the spatial resolution the gleam dataset was upscaled to 36 km 2 4 topography data as one of the five soil forming factors mcbratney et al 2003 topography significantly affects the spatial variation of the ssm considering the vital role of topography in soil science many edaphic studies have used various topography attributes as crucial factors behrens et al 2010 yang et al 2020 bao et al 2021 in this paper digital elevation models dem were used to extract the tcs at 36 km spatial resolution which can effectively describe the surface topography the dem data were acquired from the nasa shuttle radar topography mission project at 30 m original spatial resolution and processed using google earth engine 3 method 3 1 rf model as a classical nonlinear model in machine learning the rf model is composed of multiple decision trees breiman 2001 the bootstrap based sampling method in the rf model ensures robustness and resistance to overfitting thus the rf model has great advantages in fitting the complex relationship between the dependent and independent variables it should be noted that all data in both the dependent and independent variables need to be valid values i e without gaps with respect to the training process of the rf model only part of the training samples is selected approximately two thirds and the remaining samples approximately one thirds are used as the out of bag oob samples to test the model hu et al 2020 meng et al 2020 subsequently acquired oob errors can be employed to evaluate the model and determine the parameters in the rf model the importance of different independent variables can be quantified zhao et al 2018 in this paper the original daily smap and auxiliary data see section 3 2 for detailed introduction were used as the dependent and independent variables respectively to ensure the stability of the model we adopted a 5 fold cross validation for all training samples the number of decision trees ntree was fixed at 500 the testing ntree values range from 100 to 1000 with an interval of 100 and the number of leaves nleaf was set to 5 the testing nleaf values include 5 10 20 50 100 200 and 500 it was noted that the scheme of using fixed parameter setting at each time leads to satisfactory predictions i e with very close accuracy to that of the optimal parameters in the selected testing times moreover the optimized framework of the rf model was not the main concern of the study itself and the readers may refer to related references breiman 2001 3 2 characteristic extraction of auxiliary data the spatial locations of valid values in the original daily smap data i e the dependent variables change continuously on each date in the rf based fitting model however the extracted auxiliary data i e the independent variables should have complete spatial coverage without gaps hence acquiring the spatially seamless auxiliary data is an important premise section 3 2 1 introduces the solution to generate spatially seamless characteristics extracted by the hctsa method in addition the use of heterologous auxiliary data tcs and lcs is introduced in section 3 2 2 3 2 1 characteristics extracted from homologous auxiliary data using the hctsa method temporally adjacent smap data i e time series data are reliable choices with a similar spatial distribution pattern to the target ssm to be filled to deal with the unavoidable gaps in the daily smap data we dig the temporal profiles of smap time series data and extract the spatially seamless characteristics as a type of the homologous auxiliary data specifically the hctsa method was applied to determine the time series characteristics according to the effective data in the smap time series as an advanced method hctsa can extract over 7700 hctsa based time series characteristics htcs from multiple domains e g data distribution correlation information theory fulcher et al 2013 fulcher and jones 2017 this computational framework for digging time series information has been commonly used in clinical medicine schreglmann et al 2021 kim et al 2022 illness niestroy et al 2022 architecture miller 2019 automation kuatsjah et al 2019 and hydroclimates papacharalampous et al 2021 both the code and detailed description of the hctsa are available on github https github com benfulcher hctsa based on the hctsa we can acquire the htcs with spatially complete coverage for model construction even without the spatially complete original smap data the temporal span of the smap time series is a core issue in generating the htcs theoretically ssm is obviously influenced by a variety of climate factors e g temperature and precipitation considering that climate change is periodic for different regions each pixel of the ssm could be altered periodically moreover periodic climate change takes an entire year to complete and repeats the next year except for abnormal climate change it is considered that the intra annual time series of the smap data can fully describe the completely periodic change trend for each pixel as a result the corresponding entire year was selected as the temporal span for extracting the htcs when the spatial gaps of the daily smap data were filled at a random date for example when the date of the gap filled smap data ranges from 20160101 to 20161231 the smap time series data in 2016 are used to extract the htcs based on the selection of the temporal span in 2016 17 representative htcs are extracted and exhibited in fig 2 meanwhile table 1 explains each of these characteristics it is observed that the extracted htcs are spatially seamless moreover the texture difference in characteristics can describe the spatial distribution pattern of ssm data 3 2 2 characteristics extracted from heterologous auxiliary data in addition to the homologous auxiliary data i e htcs two heterologous auxiliary data were used including tcs and lcs accordingly three topography attributes i e elevation slope and aspect were extracted from the dem and two location information i e longitude and latitude were transformed from the latitude longitude grid it should be stressed that these characteristics extracted from heterologous auxiliary data are also spatially seamless details of the tcs and lcs are presented in table 1 3 3 gap filling of smap ssm data to fill the spatial gaps in the daily smap data it needs to construct the rf model between the original daily smap and the corresponding auxiliary data the formula for relating the effective data on day t in year y and extracted characteristics can be expressed as follows 1 smap eff t f htcs eff y tcs eff lcs eff where smap eff t is the effective value of the daily smap data htc eff y tcs eff and lcs eff overlap with smap eff t which are extracted from the htcs tcs and lcs according to the location of smap eff t respectively the function f was fitted using eq 1 based on the effective dependent i e daily smap data and corresponding independent variables i e auxiliary data which is migrated to the independent variables i e auxiliary data corresponding to the missing data in eq 2 consequently the corresponding dependent variables i e spatial gaps in the smap data can be filled based on the following formula 2 smap gap t f htc s gap y tcs gap lcs gap where smap gap t represents the predicted smap data i e the spatial gaps of smap eff t htc gap y tcs gap and lcs gap are extracted from the htcs tcs and lcs according to the smap gap t the reconstructed smap data in the spatial gaps i e smap gap t and the original effective smap data smap eff t are combined with the spatially seamless smap data it is noted that the original ssm information in each smap data has relatively well distributed spatial coverage even though inevitable spatial gaps exist in the daily smap data hence the distortion of model construction owing to uneven training data can be ignored by continuously filling the spatial gaps of the smap data on each date the reconstruction of all seamless daily smap data was accomplished and the ssd smap dataset was generated the complete generation process of the ssd smap data is exhibited in fig 3 the detailed process steps are listed as follows 1 the hctsa method was used to dig the smap time series data to ensure that 17 htcs with spatially complete coverage are extracted as the homologous auxiliary data 2 both spatially seamless tcs i e elevation slope and aspect and lcs i e longitude and latitude were extracted as the heterologous auxiliary data 3 auxiliary data including the homologous and heterologous corresponding to valid values in the original smap data were extracted 4 the rf model was constructed using the effective smap data and auxiliary data extracted in step 3 5 to fill the spatial gaps in the original smap data the rf model constructed in step 4 was migrated to the auxiliary data corresponding to the spatial gaps 6 the above steps were repeated for each date 3 4 validation strategy two validations were adopted in this paper first the real data were used as references to validate the simulated gaps filled using the proposed method specifically it can be seen from fig 4 that six random regions in different continents in the original smap data were simulated with gaps to ensure the stability of validation seven scenes of smap data were randomly selected for validation i e on 20150410 20160615 20170813 20181003 20191217 20200227 and 20210712 which contain fixed simulated gaps second the in situ data were employed to evaluate the ssd smap dataset the validation of network level was adopted that is all in situ data at a network were averaged it cannot be ignored that distributed difference of stations in a network can affect the validation for instance the spatial gaps in the smap data inevitably provide the null values in calculation and further increase the uncertainty of validation to reduce the effects caused by distributed difference of stations all networks were divided into two types with a grid resolution of 36 km according to the distribution of stations including sparse i e a pixel of smap data contains only one station and dense i e a pixel of smap data contains multiple stations in situ data it should be emphasized that the periods of networks used in this paper were different since the sensors have different start and end dates more details and distributed locations of the in situ data are depicted in table 2 and fig 5 respectively as benchmark data the gleam data were also utilized for the above validations in addition to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy four statistical metrics including the correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse bias bias and unbiased root mean square error ubrmse were employed in addition the kling gutpa efficiency kge was also used to evaluate the time series gupta et al 2009 4 results 4 1 validation of the proposed method based on simulated gaps the smap filled and gleam data in the six simulated gaps are exhibited in fig 6 the data on 20150410 and 20200227 were selected as the cases for the sake of space considerations respectively for regions with strong heterogeneity i e regions 2 and 4 the spatial textures in the filled data can be clearly described using the proposed method which is similar to that in the original smap data however the gleam data are smooth indicating that the spatial textures in the gleam data are different from those in the original smap data for regions with strong homogeneity i e regions 1 and 6 we found that the filled data are close to the reference conversely distinct differences exist between the original smap and gleam data in regions 3 and 5 the distribution of spatial textures in the gleam data is distinctly different from that in the smap data and filled data moreover the filled data are similar to the original smap data the results of the quantitative evaluation are portrayed in table 3 the results indicated that the filled data are more accurate than those of the gleam data the mean cc of the filled data is 0 950 which is 0 165 larger than that of the gleam data moreover the mean rmse and ubrmse of the filled data are 0 045 and 0 044 respectively which are 0 051 and 0 043 smaller than those of the gleam data the bias of the filled data is 0 001 which is closer to the reference than that of the gleam data with a bias of 0 030 specifically the cc of the filled data on 20150410 is 0 968 which is the highest among the seven reconstructed data accordingly the highest cc of the gleam data is only 0 881 which is 0 087 smaller than that of the filled data we found that the lowest cc of the simulated gaps i e with a cc of 0 922 on 20181003 is still higher than the highest cc of the gleam data i e with a cc of 0 881 on 20150410 on 20160615 both the rmse and ubrmse of the filled data are 0 037 which are smaller than those of the other filled data in contrast the smallest rmse and ubrmse of the gleam data are 0 077 and 0 066 respectively which are 0 040 and 0 029 higher than those of the filled data the optimal bias of the filled data is 0 000 on 20200227 whereas the optimal bias of the gleam data is 0 006 therefore it is demonstrated that the proposed method has reliable accuracy based on the evaluation 4 2 validation based on real gaps 4 2 1 visualization of the ssd smap dataset based on the experimental steps the ssd smap dataset containing 2428 scenes of daily data was generated from 20150401 to 20211231 the original and gap filling smap data for seven random dates i e 20150501 20160630 20170801 20180930 20191101 20201230 and 20210201 are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the gaps in the original smap data can be filled satisfactorily for example the stitching traces at the boundary could not be observed in the gap filling data as shown in fig a1 the ssd smap dataset in april 2015 is portrayed 4 2 2 quantitative assessment based on the in situ data with respect to the validation based on the in situ data at the sparse networks 10 sparse networks were used to validate the ssd smap and gleam data as shown in fig 8 the pattern of temporal changes in the in situ data is similar to that of the ssd smap and gleam data revealing that both ssm datasets can capture the dynamic change in ssm however compared with those of the gleam data the values of the ssd smap data are closer to those of the in situ data i e as reference the quantitative evaluation results based on these four statistical metrics are depicted in table 4 the ssd smap dataset has the mean kge of 0 502 which is 0 343 larger than that of the gleam dataset the mean cc of the ssd smap data is 0 733 which is 0 015 larger than that of the gleam data the mean rmse and bias of the ssd smap data are 0 054 and 0 025 respectively which are closer to the reference values than those of the gleam data with a mean rmse and bias of 0 097 and 0 075 respectively in addition the gleam data have a mean ubrmse of 0 040 which are 0 001 slightly larger than that of the ssd smap data specifically the cc of the ssd smap data at the uscrn and amma catch are 0 897 and 0 888 respectively which are higher than that of the other networks the smallest cc of the ssd smap data is 0 470 at the rsmn with respect to the gleam data cc is the highest at the uscrn with a cc of 0 895 whereas the cc is the smallest at the maqu with a cc of 0 474 we found that both the ssd smap and gleam data have the highest cc at the uscrn for most networks the rmse and bias of the ssd smap data are closer to the reference than those of the gleam data the closest rmse and bias of the ssd smap data are 0 032 at amma catch and 0 013 at smosmania among all networks thus based on the validation using the sparse networks it can be concluded that the ssd smap data are closer to the in situ data than the gleam data for the validation based on the in situ data at the dense networks we adopted six dense networks to further evaluate the accuracy of the datasets the original smap data were supplemented in this validation to analyze the differences between the original smap and reconstructed ssd smap data as shown in fig 9 it is observed that the original smap data can precisely describe the pattern of temporal changes in the ssm however the phenomenon of missing values in the smap data cannot be avoided by filling the spatial gaps in the original smap data the acquired ssd smap data still maintain their dynamic monitoring ability of smap data moreover continuous observation without the missing values is performed in addition it is observed that the smap and ssd smap data are closer to the in situ data than the gleam data the statistical metrics are listed in table 5 although the smap data exist spatial gaps the mean kge and cc of the effective smap data are 0 497 and 0 808 which are the largest among the three data furthermore both the rmse and bias of the smap data with a mean rmse and bias of 0 053 and 0 020 respectively are closer to the in situ data than those of the ssd smap and gleam data with respect to the seamless ssm data i e ssd smap and gleam data the ssd smap data have a mean kge and cc of 0 465 and 0 753 which is 0 449 and 0 040 lager than that of the gleam data the mean rmse of the ssd smap data is 0 054 which is 0 070 smaller than that of the gleam data similarly the bias of the ssd smap data with a mean bias of 0 022 is closer to the reference than that of the gleam data with a mean bias of 0 113 4 3 comparison between the different combinations of auxiliary data considering that the three characteristics i e htcs tcs and lcs used to construct the auxiliary data were extracted from different data the combination of these different characteristics can affect the reconstructed accuracy it is necessary to prove that the combined auxiliary data used are optimal specifically we filled smap data in the simulated gaps section 3 4 when only the htcs were used as auxiliary data on this basis the htcs tcs htcs lcs and a combination of the two heterologous characteristics i e htcs tcs lcs proposed were employed to compose the auxiliary data respectively with the change of the auxiliary data the smap data were filled continuously these filled results were validated by the real smap data respectively as shown in fig 10 using the htcs as auxiliary data has the lowest accuracy and stability for gap filling by introducing heterologous characteristics reconstruction accuracy can be further improved compared with htcs lcs htcs tcs have a smaller improvement in accuracy indicating that the lcs are more important than tcs for gap filling additionally the accuracy and stability of the reconstruction are optimal when three characteristics are synergistically used as auxiliary data i e htcs tcs lcs 4 4 the effect of the temporal span for extracting the htcs to test the influence of different temporal spans for extracting the htcs the original smap data from different years from 2015 to 2021 were used to extract the seven types of the htcs according to the intra annual temporal span it should be emphasized that additional two types of the htcs were supplied first based on the usable smap data from 2015 to 2021 all the original smap data were used to extract the htcs i e all second according to the change of the date the smap time series data in the corresponding year were selected to extract the htcs that is the proposed extraction method in this research in all nine types of the htcs were extracted from different temporal spans to identify the optimal method for extraction of the htcs each type of the htcs was used to construct auxiliary data in turn combined with the tcs and lcs the constructed auxiliary data were used to fill the simulated gaps in section 3 4 respectively as shown in fig 11 it can be seen that different htcs could directly affect the accuracy of reconstruction the proposed temporal span can extract the optimal htcs which can provide the highest accuracy among the nine types of the htcs 5 discussion 5 1 is the accuracy of the gap filled data at similar level as the real data theoretically the accuracy of the gap filled smap data should ideally be maintained at similar level as the real data to evaluate whether the accuracies of the gap filled and adjacent real data are at similar level two validations in temporal and spatial dimensions were executed in the eastern united states based on the in situ data specifically the accuracy of the gap filled smap data was evaluated by the in situ data meanwhile the spatially and temporally adjacent real data were also evaluated using corresponding in situ data as the references 48 in situ stations at the uscrn network located in the eastern united states were equally divided into two groups as shown in fig 12 the first group of in situ data containing the other 24 stations was used to evaluate the filled and temporally adjacent real smap data the second group of in situ data containing 24 stations was used to evaluate the spatially adjacent real smap data it should be illustrated that each station of in situ data corresponds to an individual pixel to reduce the uncertainty of validation the 236 scenes of smap data from 2015 to 2021 e g on 20150730 with the same revisit orbit were selected for validation in spatial dimension because of the variable revisit orbits the location of gaps in the selected 236 scenes of smap data always exist effective data in the temporally adjacent data thus additional 236 scenes of smap data e g on 20150729 were selected for the validation in temporal dimension which are temporally adjacent to the selected smap data previously meanwhile the corresponding gauge based gleam data were used as benchmark for comparison of the gap filled smap data as shown in table 6 the average gap filled data have a mean cc of 0 832 which is 0 004 slightly smaller than the spatially adjacent real data with a mean cc of 0 836 for the temporal dimension the validation provides a mean cc and rmse of 0 893 and 0 033 respectively revealing that the temporally adjacent real smap data are slightly more accurate than the gap filled data based on the validations of spatial and temporal dimensions we found that the filled and real smap data have similar level of accuracy in addition it can be seen that the accuracy of the gauge based gleam data with a mean kge and cc of 0 353 and 0 800 is smaller than that of the gap filled smap data with a mean kge and cc of 0 642 and 0 832 5 2 comparison of the composited data considering that the spatial gaps affect the application prospects of the smap data the multi temporal composited method is always used as an alternative to reduce the influence of spatial gaps to investigate the quality of the composited smap data both the spatially seamless ssd smap and original smap data were composited based on a relatively common temporal resolution i e 8 day composited from 2015 to 2021 by comparison it can be observed from table 7 that the two composited datasets are very similar for the overlapping areas with an average cc and rmse of 0 993 and 0 018 however there are two problems that should be noted in the spatial domain first for some regions such as region 1 in fig 13 a there are evident noises irregular distribution of maximum and minimum ssm values in the effective data composited from original smap data second it is difficult for the composited smap data to achieve spatially seamless coverage from october to april especially in the high latitude areas of the northern hemisphere such as region 2 in fig 13a because of the continuous absence of daily smap data missing information cannot be filled in these areas even with the composited method however this is not the case for the ssd smap dataset which has complete coverage such as regions 1 and 2 in fig 13b 5 3 uncertainty in the regions with short observations there always exists noticeable uncertainty in the predictions for the regions with short observations in the time series especially for the snow covered high latitude and high altitude regions dorigo et al 2015 o and orth 2021 for example since long term snow cover causes interruption in the smap time series the effective data in the known time series for these regions are not as sufficient as those for non snow regions to examine the influence of the length of effective data we selected the data in 7 dates the dates of the data are the same as those in section 4 2 1 for analysis as a benchmark method we used time series data from may to october to generate the htcs a period normally without snow the filled data were compared with those exhibited in section 4 2 1 as shown in table 8 there exists noticeable difference between the two types of predictions suggesting that the influence of short observations e g in the snow covered regions cannot be ignored 5 4 importance of different independent variables based on the rf model the normalized importance scores of different independent variables were calculated from 2015 to 2021 as shown in fig 14 the importance score of the htcs is 0 421 which is 0 013 slightly smaller than that of the lcs but 0 276 larger than that of the tcs this is because the htcs can describe the detailed spatial texture of ssm in addition we found that both lat and lon are more important than other characteristics this is mainly because that the combination of two characteristics provides a preliminary determination of climate type and precipitation frequency for example the region located at the 20th parallel north and the 20th parallel east belongs to tropical desert climate with very little precipitation 5 5 future research although we filled the spatial gaps in smap data with satisfactory accuracy three potential issues still need to be addressed first with respect to the heterologous auxiliary data except for the considered tcs and lcs other factors such as precipitation soil property phenology evapotranspiration and surface temperature that affect the change in ssm are potential choices abbaszadeh et al 2019 xu et al 2022 it is worthwhile to develop a cooperative solution to fill spatial gaps by introducing these factors second the sensitivity of ssm retrieved from each microwave band is different for each land cover type gao et al 2022 it has not been demonstrated that the accuracy of the smap dataset is optimal for each land cover type even though the smap dataset is always considered a reliable retrieval with high accuracy in general thus selecting the optimal ssm retrievals for the assimilation of different land cover types may be an interesting avenue in future research third as a type of typical machine learning models deep learning based methods are assumed to have stronger fitting ability which might be beneficial to further increase the accuracy of gap filling it is part of our on going research to develop new gap filling methods for daily smap ssm dataset based on deep learning 6 conclusion in this paper we developed a rf based method to fill the spatial gaps in the smap time series and generated a ssd smap dataset from 2015 to 2021 the homologous auxiliary data i e smap ssm time series with inherent spatial gaps were employed in the proposed method because of the same physical meaning to cope with the spatial gaps in the auxiliary data smap ssm time series 17 seamless htcs were extracted from the smap time series data based on the hctsa framework furthermore three tcs and two lcs were extracted from the dem and latitude longitude grid base on the daily smap and the corresponding auxiliary data with spatially complete coverage the rf model was constructed which was further migrated for filling the gaps at the target time two separate validations were carried out first the real smap data were used to validate the filled data in the simulated gaps the proposed method produced mean cc and rmse values of 0 950 and 0 045 respectively second sparse and dense in situ networks were applied to validate the datasets the mean cc and rmse of the proposed ssd smap dataset for sparse dense networks were 0 733 0 753 and 0 054 0 054 respectively which are larger than those of the gleam dataset therefore the ssd smap dataset is a reliable ssm dataset for accomplishing the spatio temporal

1853,surface soil moisture ssm is a vital component in terrestrial hydrological processes as a type of important microwave remote sensing based ssm dataset the soil moisture active passive smap ssm data were available since 2015 and have been applied to many studies however the spatial gaps in the smap ssm data affect greatly its applicability to address this issue this study developed a method to fill the spatial gaps in the smap ssm data generating a spatially seamless daily smap ssd smap ssm dataset from 2015 to 2021 the method makes full use of the long smap ssm time series data with inherent spatial gaps to deal with the continuously changed spatial gaps in the daily smap data we used a highly comparative time series analysis hctsa to dig the temporal profiles of the smap ssm time series producing 17 seamless hctsa based time series characteristics htcs both spatially seamless topography characteristics tcs and location characteristics lcs were also considered moreover a random forest rf model was trained to construct the relation between the valid daily smap data at the prediction time and the seamless auxiliary data i e 17 htcs coupled with tcs and lcs subsequently the constructed rf model was migrated to fill the spatial gaps of the smap data at the corresponding time the proposed method was validated in both simulated gaps real data as reference and real gaps in situ ssm data as reference the produced ssd smap dataset was also compared with the model based global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam dataset the results indicated that the ssd smap data are closer to the in situ data with an unbiased root mean square error ubrmse of 0 040 m3 m3 the ssd smap dataset can provide data support for global and regional research in related fields keywords surface soil moisture ssm soil moisture active passive smap data reconstruction gap filling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface soil moisture ssm is a key hydrological indicator that has been widely applied to climate change guillod et al 2015 li et al 2022 drought monitoring zhou et al 2017 souza et al 2021 terrestrial carbon cycle wu et al 2020 humphrey et al 2021 and other studies currently three sources of ssm data are widely utilized including ground based observation dorigo et al 2011 model based assimilation e g the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2011 and microwave remote sensing based retrieval e g the soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 in general ground based observation of ssm has the optimal accuracy among the aforementioned sources of ssm data because of direct measurement without penetration of obstacles dorigo et al 2015 colliander et al 2017 thus ground based ssm data are usually used as references to validate model and remote sensing based ssm data zeng et al 2015 liu et al 2021 xu et al 2021 however the spatial distribution of ground based ssm data is sparse which limits its application at the global scale rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 conversely model based assimilation of ssm has complete spatial coverage which fits large scale studies well however model based ssm data require relatively complex assimilation processing and its accuracy depends on the quality of the assimilated inputs bi et al 2016 tavakol et al 2021 compared with the model based assimilation microwave remote sensing based retrieval can provide direct observations of ssm various satellites carrying different microwave sensors have been launched to acquire reliable and spatially continuous microwave remote sensing based ssm data liu et al 2011 babaeian et al 2019 long time series ssm products with a daily temporal resolution are available such as the smap chan et al 2016 abbaszadeh et al 2021 the advanced scatterometer ascat bartalis et al 2007 the advanced microwave scanning radiometer onboard the earth observing system amsr e njoku et al 2003 the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 and the fengyun 3 soil moisture product parinussa et al 2014 based on the aforementioned microwave remote sensing based ssm products the european space agency esa developed a merged method to generate the climate change initiative cci dorigo et al 2017 however due to the discontinuous coverage of the satellite orbits the aforementioned microwave remote sensing based ssm data have unavoidable spatial gaps long et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the smap ssm data for instance have approximately 25 to 60 missing this greatly affects the application therefore it is an urgent task to develop solutions to filling the missing smap ssm data with respect to the spatial gap filling of ssm data many driven factors extracted from other sensors were used as auxiliary data i e hereafter called heterologous auxiliary data based on multiple factors e g atmospheric forcings and static physiographic attributes fang et al 2017 developed a deep learning method to fill the gaps of the smap data in the continental united states likewise llamas et al 2020 utilized precipitation atmospheric temperature and soil texture combined with multiple regression models to fill spatial gaps in the cci data almendra martín et al 2021 reconstructed the cci data based on soil texture land surface temperature lst and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi using a support vector machine model however these driven factors e g lst and ndvi acquired by optical remote sensing technology are difficult to accomplish daily and spatially seamless global observation due to the orbit gaps and contamination of atmospheric conditions ma et al 2022 thus these heterologous auxiliary data are not directly suitable for gap filling of daily smap data at the global scale meanwhile the aforementioned methods for gap filling always depend on the fitting performance between the heterologous auxiliary data and known ssm data considering that the difference in physical meaning between variables heterologous auxiliary data and ssm usually unavoidably affect the post gap filling process the use of the ssm time series hereafter called homologous auxiliary data tends to be a preferable choice jiang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 yang et al 2022 guevara et al 2021 used inter annual mean values of cci for each pixel as the training data to develop a spatially seamless annual cci dataset at a spatial resolution of 15 km based on slow changing static variables including topography parameter bioclimatic and soil type however these methods sacrifice the fine temporal resolution of the ssm data to fully maintain the temporal resolution of the original ssm data the time series data were fused by zhang et al 2021 specifically the great complementarity of spatial coverage was adopted for the gap filling of amsr2 generating a global seamless daily amsr2 dataset from 2013 to 2019 according to the evaluation of different microwave remote sensing based ssm datasets the quality e g accuracy continuity and stability of the smap ssm dataset is generally more satisfactory than other ssm datasets at the global scale kim et al 2018 evaluated various ssm datasets including smap amsr2 and ascat and found that the smap dataset was the closest to ground based observations simultaneously the smap dataset displayed a higher signal to noise ratio than other ssm datasets based on triple collocation statistics kumar et al 2018 also demonstrated that the smap dataset had smaller errors than other ssm datasets including amsr e ascat smos and amsr2 based on information theory likewise ma et al 2019 concluded that the smap dataset was a more reliable choice in terms of capturing the dynamic change of ssm than amsr e amsr2 ascat and smos ma et al 2019 at a regional scale cui et al 2017 and wang et al 2021 showed that the smap dataset outperformed the smos in terms of accuracy and stability to take full advantage of smap it is of great significance to fill the gaps in the smap dataset and generate a spatially seamless daily smap ssd smap ssm dataset in general the model for filling missing data always needs to be constructed in an overlapping area with valid information of both the original and auxiliary data considering the continuous change of spatial gaps in daily smap data there exists a constant and dynamic loss of spatial coverage for smap time series thus it is difficult to construct a filling model based on the use of homologous smap time series directly in this paper a highly comparative time series analysis hctsa based method was proposed to deal with the continuous change of spatial gaps in smap time series data based on this method the spatially complete homologous characteristics can be extracted by the pattern of temporal changes in the smap data overcoming the effects of the missing values in the time series data in addition to the homologous smap time series data heterologous auxiliary data were also considered including topography characteristics tcs and location characteristics lcs topography can directly affect soil properties jenny 1941 mcbratney et al 2003 likewise location information reflects climate divisions and further distinguishes the pattern of temporal change in ssm peel et al 2007 wang et al 2022 to fully fit the complex relationship between the original smap data and various auxiliary data including homologous and heterologous a random forest rf model was developed owing to its great robustness and resistance to overfitting based on the proposed method we generated a ssd smap ssm dataset at the global scale from 2015 to 2021 two quantitative validations were conducted first the original smap data were selected as references to evaluate the simulated gaps that were filled using the proposed method second the available in situ data were divided into sparse and dense networks each network containing multiple in situ data to validate the ssd smap dataset the two major contributions of this study are summarized as follows 1 a hctsa based method was proposed to fill the widely existed gaps in the observed smap ssm time series the method makes full use of the homologous smap ssm time series and can deal with the continuously changed gaps across the temporal domain producing spatially seamless characteristics from the long smap time series facilitating modeling the relation between time series 2 a global daily and spatial seamless smap dataset ssd smap from 2015 to 2021 was generated through the developed method the ssd smap dataset has a reliable accuracy and can be applied to the dynamic monitoring of ssm and related studies at the global scale 2 data 2 1 smap ssm data the smap satellite carrying an l band active radar and a passive radiometer was launched in january 2015 by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa based on the different sensors three smap ssm datasets were retrieved at 3 km 9 km and 36 km spatial resolutions das et al 2014 montzka et al 2016 which are freely available from the national snow and ice data center nsidc https nsidc org daily smap data were available from 31 march 2015 including observations of the ascending and descending half orbits i e am and pm data zhao et al 2018 however the onboard l band active radar failed in july 2015 interrupting the acquisition of the original smap ssm data at a spatial resolution of 3 km and 9 km chan et al 2018 hence only original smap data at 36 km spatial resolution were generated continually excluding the post processed spl3smp e and spl2smap s in this paper the spatial gaps in the smap level 3 products version 8 were filled from 1 april 2015 to 31 december 2021 we calculated the proportion of the original coverage based on the known smap data moreover the data acquired from both am and pm were composited by averaging both to maintain the stability of the smap data as shown in fig 1 it is observed that the proportion of the original coverage of the daily smap data is approximately 40 to 75 implying that daily ssm information with complete spatial coverage could not be directly acquired from the original smap data 2 2 in situ data the in situ data were measured by ground based sensors which recorded the dynamic changes in soil moisture at different depths escorihuela et al 2010 adams et al 2015 in this paper the in situ data acquired by the international soil moisture network ismn https ismn earth en were utilized to validate the different ssm datasets including the original smap ssd smap and gleam dorigo et al 2010 dorigo et al 2021 additionally two independent networks i e fort cobb and little washita in oklahoma state were also adopted for evaluation starks et al 2014 to match the depth of the ssm dataset the measured depths of the selected in situ data were not larger than 0 05 m the detailed information of the in situ data was provided in section 3 4 2 3 gleam data the gleam dataset https www gleam eu was derived by model based assimilation at 25 km spatial resolution based on various datasets e g the cci ssm dataset which was generated at the daily scale with global coverage miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 owing to its spatially seamless coverage and fine temporal resolution the gleam dataset is widely applied in many global soil moisture studies to avoid spatial gaps and coarse temporal resolution in this paper the gleam version 3 6a was used as the benchmark data and compared with the filled ssd smap dataset to maintain the consistency of the spatial resolution the gleam dataset was upscaled to 36 km 2 4 topography data as one of the five soil forming factors mcbratney et al 2003 topography significantly affects the spatial variation of the ssm considering the vital role of topography in soil science many edaphic studies have used various topography attributes as crucial factors behrens et al 2010 yang et al 2020 bao et al 2021 in this paper digital elevation models dem were used to extract the tcs at 36 km spatial resolution which can effectively describe the surface topography the dem data were acquired from the nasa shuttle radar topography mission project at 30 m original spatial resolution and processed using google earth engine 3 method 3 1 rf model as a classical nonlinear model in machine learning the rf model is composed of multiple decision trees breiman 2001 the bootstrap based sampling method in the rf model ensures robustness and resistance to overfitting thus the rf model has great advantages in fitting the complex relationship between the dependent and independent variables it should be noted that all data in both the dependent and independent variables need to be valid values i e without gaps with respect to the training process of the rf model only part of the training samples is selected approximately two thirds and the remaining samples approximately one thirds are used as the out of bag oob samples to test the model hu et al 2020 meng et al 2020 subsequently acquired oob errors can be employed to evaluate the model and determine the parameters in the rf model the importance of different independent variables can be quantified zhao et al 2018 in this paper the original daily smap and auxiliary data see section 3 2 for detailed introduction were used as the dependent and independent variables respectively to ensure the stability of the model we adopted a 5 fold cross validation for all training samples the number of decision trees ntree was fixed at 500 the testing ntree values range from 100 to 1000 with an interval of 100 and the number of leaves nleaf was set to 5 the testing nleaf values include 5 10 20 50 100 200 and 500 it was noted that the scheme of using fixed parameter setting at each time leads to satisfactory predictions i e with very close accuracy to that of the optimal parameters in the selected testing times moreover the optimized framework of the rf model was not the main concern of the study itself and the readers may refer to related references breiman 2001 3 2 characteristic extraction of auxiliary data the spatial locations of valid values in the original daily smap data i e the dependent variables change continuously on each date in the rf based fitting model however the extracted auxiliary data i e the independent variables should have complete spatial coverage without gaps hence acquiring the spatially seamless auxiliary data is an important premise section 3 2 1 introduces the solution to generate spatially seamless characteristics extracted by the hctsa method in addition the use of heterologous auxiliary data tcs and lcs is introduced in section 3 2 2 3 2 1 characteristics extracted from homologous auxiliary data using the hctsa method temporally adjacent smap data i e time series data are reliable choices with a similar spatial distribution pattern to the target ssm to be filled to deal with the unavoidable gaps in the daily smap data we dig the temporal profiles of smap time series data and extract the spatially seamless characteristics as a type of the homologous auxiliary data specifically the hctsa method was applied to determine the time series characteristics according to the effective data in the smap time series as an advanced method hctsa can extract over 7700 hctsa based time series characteristics htcs from multiple domains e g data distribution correlation information theory fulcher et al 2013 fulcher and jones 2017 this computational framework for digging time series information has been commonly used in clinical medicine schreglmann et al 2021 kim et al 2022 illness niestroy et al 2022 architecture miller 2019 automation kuatsjah et al 2019 and hydroclimates papacharalampous et al 2021 both the code and detailed description of the hctsa are available on github https github com benfulcher hctsa based on the hctsa we can acquire the htcs with spatially complete coverage for model construction even without the spatially complete original smap data the temporal span of the smap time series is a core issue in generating the htcs theoretically ssm is obviously influenced by a variety of climate factors e g temperature and precipitation considering that climate change is periodic for different regions each pixel of the ssm could be altered periodically moreover periodic climate change takes an entire year to complete and repeats the next year except for abnormal climate change it is considered that the intra annual time series of the smap data can fully describe the completely periodic change trend for each pixel as a result the corresponding entire year was selected as the temporal span for extracting the htcs when the spatial gaps of the daily smap data were filled at a random date for example when the date of the gap filled smap data ranges from 20160101 to 20161231 the smap time series data in 2016 are used to extract the htcs based on the selection of the temporal span in 2016 17 representative htcs are extracted and exhibited in fig 2 meanwhile table 1 explains each of these characteristics it is observed that the extracted htcs are spatially seamless moreover the texture difference in characteristics can describe the spatial distribution pattern of ssm data 3 2 2 characteristics extracted from heterologous auxiliary data in addition to the homologous auxiliary data i e htcs two heterologous auxiliary data were used including tcs and lcs accordingly three topography attributes i e elevation slope and aspect were extracted from the dem and two location information i e longitude and latitude were transformed from the latitude longitude grid it should be stressed that these characteristics extracted from heterologous auxiliary data are also spatially seamless details of the tcs and lcs are presented in table 1 3 3 gap filling of smap ssm data to fill the spatial gaps in the daily smap data it needs to construct the rf model between the original daily smap and the corresponding auxiliary data the formula for relating the effective data on day t in year y and extracted characteristics can be expressed as follows 1 smap eff t f htcs eff y tcs eff lcs eff where smap eff t is the effective value of the daily smap data htc eff y tcs eff and lcs eff overlap with smap eff t which are extracted from the htcs tcs and lcs according to the location of smap eff t respectively the function f was fitted using eq 1 based on the effective dependent i e daily smap data and corresponding independent variables i e auxiliary data which is migrated to the independent variables i e auxiliary data corresponding to the missing data in eq 2 consequently the corresponding dependent variables i e spatial gaps in the smap data can be filled based on the following formula 2 smap gap t f htc s gap y tcs gap lcs gap where smap gap t represents the predicted smap data i e the spatial gaps of smap eff t htc gap y tcs gap and lcs gap are extracted from the htcs tcs and lcs according to the smap gap t the reconstructed smap data in the spatial gaps i e smap gap t and the original effective smap data smap eff t are combined with the spatially seamless smap data it is noted that the original ssm information in each smap data has relatively well distributed spatial coverage even though inevitable spatial gaps exist in the daily smap data hence the distortion of model construction owing to uneven training data can be ignored by continuously filling the spatial gaps of the smap data on each date the reconstruction of all seamless daily smap data was accomplished and the ssd smap dataset was generated the complete generation process of the ssd smap data is exhibited in fig 3 the detailed process steps are listed as follows 1 the hctsa method was used to dig the smap time series data to ensure that 17 htcs with spatially complete coverage are extracted as the homologous auxiliary data 2 both spatially seamless tcs i e elevation slope and aspect and lcs i e longitude and latitude were extracted as the heterologous auxiliary data 3 auxiliary data including the homologous and heterologous corresponding to valid values in the original smap data were extracted 4 the rf model was constructed using the effective smap data and auxiliary data extracted in step 3 5 to fill the spatial gaps in the original smap data the rf model constructed in step 4 was migrated to the auxiliary data corresponding to the spatial gaps 6 the above steps were repeated for each date 3 4 validation strategy two validations were adopted in this paper first the real data were used as references to validate the simulated gaps filled using the proposed method specifically it can be seen from fig 4 that six random regions in different continents in the original smap data were simulated with gaps to ensure the stability of validation seven scenes of smap data were randomly selected for validation i e on 20150410 20160615 20170813 20181003 20191217 20200227 and 20210712 which contain fixed simulated gaps second the in situ data were employed to evaluate the ssd smap dataset the validation of network level was adopted that is all in situ data at a network were averaged it cannot be ignored that distributed difference of stations in a network can affect the validation for instance the spatial gaps in the smap data inevitably provide the null values in calculation and further increase the uncertainty of validation to reduce the effects caused by distributed difference of stations all networks were divided into two types with a grid resolution of 36 km according to the distribution of stations including sparse i e a pixel of smap data contains only one station and dense i e a pixel of smap data contains multiple stations in situ data it should be emphasized that the periods of networks used in this paper were different since the sensors have different start and end dates more details and distributed locations of the in situ data are depicted in table 2 and fig 5 respectively as benchmark data the gleam data were also utilized for the above validations in addition to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy four statistical metrics including the correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse bias bias and unbiased root mean square error ubrmse were employed in addition the kling gutpa efficiency kge was also used to evaluate the time series gupta et al 2009 4 results 4 1 validation of the proposed method based on simulated gaps the smap filled and gleam data in the six simulated gaps are exhibited in fig 6 the data on 20150410 and 20200227 were selected as the cases for the sake of space considerations respectively for regions with strong heterogeneity i e regions 2 and 4 the spatial textures in the filled data can be clearly described using the proposed method which is similar to that in the original smap data however the gleam data are smooth indicating that the spatial textures in the gleam data are different from those in the original smap data for regions with strong homogeneity i e regions 1 and 6 we found that the filled data are close to the reference conversely distinct differences exist between the original smap and gleam data in regions 3 and 5 the distribution of spatial textures in the gleam data is distinctly different from that in the smap data and filled data moreover the filled data are similar to the original smap data the results of the quantitative evaluation are portrayed in table 3 the results indicated that the filled data are more accurate than those of the gleam data the mean cc of the filled data is 0 950 which is 0 165 larger than that of the gleam data moreover the mean rmse and ubrmse of the filled data are 0 045 and 0 044 respectively which are 0 051 and 0 043 smaller than those of the gleam data the bias of the filled data is 0 001 which is closer to the reference than that of the gleam data with a bias of 0 030 specifically the cc of the filled data on 20150410 is 0 968 which is the highest among the seven reconstructed data accordingly the highest cc of the gleam data is only 0 881 which is 0 087 smaller than that of the filled data we found that the lowest cc of the simulated gaps i e with a cc of 0 922 on 20181003 is still higher than the highest cc of the gleam data i e with a cc of 0 881 on 20150410 on 20160615 both the rmse and ubrmse of the filled data are 0 037 which are smaller than those of the other filled data in contrast the smallest rmse and ubrmse of the gleam data are 0 077 and 0 066 respectively which are 0 040 and 0 029 higher than those of the filled data the optimal bias of the filled data is 0 000 on 20200227 whereas the optimal bias of the gleam data is 0 006 therefore it is demonstrated that the proposed method has reliable accuracy based on the evaluation 4 2 validation based on real gaps 4 2 1 visualization of the ssd smap dataset based on the experimental steps the ssd smap dataset containing 2428 scenes of daily data was generated from 20150401 to 20211231 the original and gap filling smap data for seven random dates i e 20150501 20160630 20170801 20180930 20191101 20201230 and 20210201 are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the gaps in the original smap data can be filled satisfactorily for example the stitching traces at the boundary could not be observed in the gap filling data as shown in fig a1 the ssd smap dataset in april 2015 is portrayed 4 2 2 quantitative assessment based on the in situ data with respect to the validation based on the in situ data at the sparse networks 10 sparse networks were used to validate the ssd smap and gleam data as shown in fig 8 the pattern of temporal changes in the in situ data is similar to that of the ssd smap and gleam data revealing that both ssm datasets can capture the dynamic change in ssm however compared with those of the gleam data the values of the ssd smap data are closer to those of the in situ data i e as reference the quantitative evaluation results based on these four statistical metrics are depicted in table 4 the ssd smap dataset has the mean kge of 0 502 which is 0 343 larger than that of the gleam dataset the mean cc of the ssd smap data is 0 733 which is 0 015 larger than that of the gleam data the mean rmse and bias of the ssd smap data are 0 054 and 0 025 respectively which are closer to the reference values than those of the gleam data with a mean rmse and bias of 0 097 and 0 075 respectively in addition the gleam data have a mean ubrmse of 0 040 which are 0 001 slightly larger than that of the ssd smap data specifically the cc of the ssd smap data at the uscrn and amma catch are 0 897 and 0 888 respectively which are higher than that of the other networks the smallest cc of the ssd smap data is 0 470 at the rsmn with respect to the gleam data cc is the highest at the uscrn with a cc of 0 895 whereas the cc is the smallest at the maqu with a cc of 0 474 we found that both the ssd smap and gleam data have the highest cc at the uscrn for most networks the rmse and bias of the ssd smap data are closer to the reference than those of the gleam data the closest rmse and bias of the ssd smap data are 0 032 at amma catch and 0 013 at smosmania among all networks thus based on the validation using the sparse networks it can be concluded that the ssd smap data are closer to the in situ data than the gleam data for the validation based on the in situ data at the dense networks we adopted six dense networks to further evaluate the accuracy of the datasets the original smap data were supplemented in this validation to analyze the differences between the original smap and reconstructed ssd smap data as shown in fig 9 it is observed that the original smap data can precisely describe the pattern of temporal changes in the ssm however the phenomenon of missing values in the smap data cannot be avoided by filling the spatial gaps in the original smap data the acquired ssd smap data still maintain their dynamic monitoring ability of smap data moreover continuous observation without the missing values is performed in addition it is observed that the smap and ssd smap data are closer to the in situ data than the gleam data the statistical metrics are listed in table 5 although the smap data exist spatial gaps the mean kge and cc of the effective smap data are 0 497 and 0 808 which are the largest among the three data furthermore both the rmse and bias of the smap data with a mean rmse and bias of 0 053 and 0 020 respectively are closer to the in situ data than those of the ssd smap and gleam data with respect to the seamless ssm data i e ssd smap and gleam data the ssd smap data have a mean kge and cc of 0 465 and 0 753 which is 0 449 and 0 040 lager than that of the gleam data the mean rmse of the ssd smap data is 0 054 which is 0 070 smaller than that of the gleam data similarly the bias of the ssd smap data with a mean bias of 0 022 is closer to the reference than that of the gleam data with a mean bias of 0 113 4 3 comparison between the different combinations of auxiliary data considering that the three characteristics i e htcs tcs and lcs used to construct the auxiliary data were extracted from different data the combination of these different characteristics can affect the reconstructed accuracy it is necessary to prove that the combined auxiliary data used are optimal specifically we filled smap data in the simulated gaps section 3 4 when only the htcs were used as auxiliary data on this basis the htcs tcs htcs lcs and a combination of the two heterologous characteristics i e htcs tcs lcs proposed were employed to compose the auxiliary data respectively with the change of the auxiliary data the smap data were filled continuously these filled results were validated by the real smap data respectively as shown in fig 10 using the htcs as auxiliary data has the lowest accuracy and stability for gap filling by introducing heterologous characteristics reconstruction accuracy can be further improved compared with htcs lcs htcs tcs have a smaller improvement in accuracy indicating that the lcs are more important than tcs for gap filling additionally the accuracy and stability of the reconstruction are optimal when three characteristics are synergistically used as auxiliary data i e htcs tcs lcs 4 4 the effect of the temporal span for extracting the htcs to test the influence of different temporal spans for extracting the htcs the original smap data from different years from 2015 to 2021 were used to extract the seven types of the htcs according to the intra annual temporal span it should be emphasized that additional two types of the htcs were supplied first based on the usable smap data from 2015 to 2021 all the original smap data were used to extract the htcs i e all second according to the change of the date the smap time series data in the corresponding year were selected to extract the htcs that is the proposed extraction method in this research in all nine types of the htcs were extracted from different temporal spans to identify the optimal method for extraction of the htcs each type of the htcs was used to construct auxiliary data in turn combined with the tcs and lcs the constructed auxiliary data were used to fill the simulated gaps in section 3 4 respectively as shown in fig 11 it can be seen that different htcs could directly affect the accuracy of reconstruction the proposed temporal span can extract the optimal htcs which can provide the highest accuracy among the nine types of the htcs 5 discussion 5 1 is the accuracy of the gap filled data at similar level as the real data theoretically the accuracy of the gap filled smap data should ideally be maintained at similar level as the real data to evaluate whether the accuracies of the gap filled and adjacent real data are at similar level two validations in temporal and spatial dimensions were executed in the eastern united states based on the in situ data specifically the accuracy of the gap filled smap data was evaluated by the in situ data meanwhile the spatially and temporally adjacent real data were also evaluated using corresponding in situ data as the references 48 in situ stations at the uscrn network located in the eastern united states were equally divided into two groups as shown in fig 12 the first group of in situ data containing the other 24 stations was used to evaluate the filled and temporally adjacent real smap data the second group of in situ data containing 24 stations was used to evaluate the spatially adjacent real smap data it should be illustrated that each station of in situ data corresponds to an individual pixel to reduce the uncertainty of validation the 236 scenes of smap data from 2015 to 2021 e g on 20150730 with the same revisit orbit were selected for validation in spatial dimension because of the variable revisit orbits the location of gaps in the selected 236 scenes of smap data always exist effective data in the temporally adjacent data thus additional 236 scenes of smap data e g on 20150729 were selected for the validation in temporal dimension which are temporally adjacent to the selected smap data previously meanwhile the corresponding gauge based gleam data were used as benchmark for comparison of the gap filled smap data as shown in table 6 the average gap filled data have a mean cc of 0 832 which is 0 004 slightly smaller than the spatially adjacent real data with a mean cc of 0 836 for the temporal dimension the validation provides a mean cc and rmse of 0 893 and 0 033 respectively revealing that the temporally adjacent real smap data are slightly more accurate than the gap filled data based on the validations of spatial and temporal dimensions we found that the filled and real smap data have similar level of accuracy in addition it can be seen that the accuracy of the gauge based gleam data with a mean kge and cc of 0 353 and 0 800 is smaller than that of the gap filled smap data with a mean kge and cc of 0 642 and 0 832 5 2 comparison of the composited data considering that the spatial gaps affect the application prospects of the smap data the multi temporal composited method is always used as an alternative to reduce the influence of spatial gaps to investigate the quality of the composited smap data both the spatially seamless ssd smap and original smap data were composited based on a relatively common temporal resolution i e 8 day composited from 2015 to 2021 by comparison it can be observed from table 7 that the two composited datasets are very similar for the overlapping areas with an average cc and rmse of 0 993 and 0 018 however there are two problems that should be noted in the spatial domain first for some regions such as region 1 in fig 13 a there are evident noises irregular distribution of maximum and minimum ssm values in the effective data composited from original smap data second it is difficult for the composited smap data to achieve spatially seamless coverage from october to april especially in the high latitude areas of the northern hemisphere such as region 2 in fig 13a because of the continuous absence of daily smap data missing information cannot be filled in these areas even with the composited method however this is not the case for the ssd smap dataset which has complete coverage such as regions 1 and 2 in fig 13b 5 3 uncertainty in the regions with short observations there always exists noticeable uncertainty in the predictions for the regions with short observations in the time series especially for the snow covered high latitude and high altitude regions dorigo et al 2015 o and orth 2021 for example since long term snow cover causes interruption in the smap time series the effective data in the known time series for these regions are not as sufficient as those for non snow regions to examine the influence of the length of effective data we selected the data in 7 dates the dates of the data are the same as those in section 4 2 1 for analysis as a benchmark method we used time series data from may to october to generate the htcs a period normally without snow the filled data were compared with those exhibited in section 4 2 1 as shown in table 8 there exists noticeable difference between the two types of predictions suggesting that the influence of short observations e g in the snow covered regions cannot be ignored 5 4 importance of different independent variables based on the rf model the normalized importance scores of different independent variables were calculated from 2015 to 2021 as shown in fig 14 the importance score of the htcs is 0 421 which is 0 013 slightly smaller than that of the lcs but 0 276 larger than that of the tcs this is because the htcs can describe the detailed spatial texture of ssm in addition we found that both lat and lon are more important than other characteristics this is mainly because that the combination of two characteristics provides a preliminary determination of climate type and precipitation frequency for example the region located at the 20th parallel north and the 20th parallel east belongs to tropical desert climate with very little precipitation 5 5 future research although we filled the spatial gaps in smap data with satisfactory accuracy three potential issues still need to be addressed first with respect to the heterologous auxiliary data except for the considered tcs and lcs other factors such as precipitation soil property phenology evapotranspiration and surface temperature that affect the change in ssm are potential choices abbaszadeh et al 2019 xu et al 2022 it is worthwhile to develop a cooperative solution to fill spatial gaps by introducing these factors second the sensitivity of ssm retrieved from each microwave band is different for each land cover type gao et al 2022 it has not been demonstrated that the accuracy of the smap dataset is optimal for each land cover type even though the smap dataset is always considered a reliable retrieval with high accuracy in general thus selecting the optimal ssm retrievals for the assimilation of different land cover types may be an interesting avenue in future research third as a type of typical machine learning models deep learning based methods are assumed to have stronger fitting ability which might be beneficial to further increase the accuracy of gap filling it is part of our on going research to develop new gap filling methods for daily smap ssm dataset based on deep learning 6 conclusion in this paper we developed a rf based method to fill the spatial gaps in the smap time series and generated a ssd smap dataset from 2015 to 2021 the homologous auxiliary data i e smap ssm time series with inherent spatial gaps were employed in the proposed method because of the same physical meaning to cope with the spatial gaps in the auxiliary data smap ssm time series 17 seamless htcs were extracted from the smap time series data based on the hctsa framework furthermore three tcs and two lcs were extracted from the dem and latitude longitude grid base on the daily smap and the corresponding auxiliary data with spatially complete coverage the rf model was constructed which was further migrated for filling the gaps at the target time two separate validations were carried out first the real smap data were used to validate the filled data in the simulated gaps the proposed method produced mean cc and rmse values of 0 950 and 0 045 respectively second sparse and dense in situ networks were applied to validate the datasets the mean cc and rmse of the proposed ssd smap dataset for sparse dense networks were 0 733 0 753 and 0 054 0 054 respectively which are larger than those of the gleam dataset therefore the ssd smap dataset is a reliable ssm dataset for accomplishing the spatio temporal

1854,current researches on estimating soil salt movement during the freeze and thaw period are mainly based on total salt concentration while ignoring the phase change of multi component salts in this study the potential transport capability of soil water and salt ions in the frozen layer was investigated based on chemical characteristics and solute convection diffusion theory field experiments were implemented to measure the change of total soil water soil salt and its ion components the soil water and salt content in liquid and solid phases were calculated by the frezchem model and then the movement of liquid soil water and soluble salt were simulated by the hydrus 1d model the potential migration capability of soil water and salt components were then estimated by comparing the distribution profiles obtained by hydrus 1d and frezchem the results show that more than 74 5 of cl na and so4 were in liquid phase which were less affected by precipitation dissolution reaction and owned strong mitigation the liquid soil water soluble salt and salt ions in the frozen layer tended to decrease at the beginning of the freeze period and increase significantly at the end the migration direction and quantity of various salt ions were different due to their concentration gradient and diffusion coefficient causing the larger potential convection and dispersion quantity of na cl and so4 2 than those of ca2 mg2 and hco3 this study provides a new perspective for soil salt movement in frozen soil in agricultural areas with shallow groundwater table depth keywords freeze and thaw chemical characteristics dynamic effect potential movement capacity frezchem data availability i have shared the link to my data code at attach file step 1 introduction seasonal frozen soil is widely distributed in the world accounting for about 55 to 60 of the exposed land surface in the northern hemisphere zhang et al 2008 seasonally frozen soil undergoes freeze and thaw influenced by temperature change and the freeze thaw cycle causes significant changes in soil properties mahedi et al 2019 rooney et al 2022 resulting in redistribution of heat soil water and salt sarsembayeva zhussupbekov 2021 wan et al 2021 ice and liquid water coexist dynamically in frozen soil pores and the phase transition of soil water is accompanied by a large flux of latent heat boike et al 1998 li koike 2003 the presence of soil salt lowers the soil freezing temperature below 0 c banin anderson 1974 and the freezing point decreases with the increase of soil solution concentration bing ma 2011 cary mayland 1972 wan et al 2015 the interaction of soil water heat and salt are highly corelated and very complicated during the freeze and thaw period rouabhi et al 2018 tounsi et al 2020 the study of soil freeze thaw cycle is of great significance to hydrological cycle infrastructure construction and agricultural industry in cold regions bao et al 2016 lai et al 2013 liu jia 2019 mandolini viggiani 2017 in addition seasonal frozen soil is sensitive to external environmental changes e g degradation and type change of frozen soil under global warming adane et al 2019 stocker 2014 making frozen soil research being crucial for human adaptation to environmental change yu et al 2018 many researches have studied the existence form migration mechanism and migration direction of soil water in frozen soil there exists liquid water at temperatures far below freezing point spaans baker 1995 therefore three phases of soil water in unsaturated frozen soil coexist as solid liquid and gas phase he et al 2018 bing et al 2015 found that there were many factors impacting the soil water migration e g the temperature gradient initial soil water content soil salinity and soil structure the concept of soil water potential gradient was introduced to reflect the comprehensive effect of the driving forces on water migration hohmann 1997 torrance schellekens 2006 xu et al 2010 current consistent perspective on soil water movement is that soil water migrates from unfrozen soil to frozen soil along the direction of decreasing temperature which increases the soil water content of frozen soil hoekstra et al 1965 wang et al 2019 zhang sun 2011 sweidan et al 2022 the soil salt migration direction is more complicated than soil water during the freeze period some researchers observed salt accumulation in frozen soil campbell et al 1970 rima beier 2018 wan et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 and attributed it to the fact that liquid soil water carries soil salt to migrate to frozen soil cary mayland 1972 observed the movement of cacl2 lii and k2so4 in unsaturated frozen soil column under temperature gradient in the laboratory and found that the salts all moved from the warmer region to the cooler region qin et al 2021 monitored the change of soil water and salt content in songnen plain of china during the freeze and thaw period and found salt enrichment in the frozen soil wan et al 2019 also found that soil salt ions migrated from the warm end to the cold end in the low temperature sodium sulfate soil by laboratory experiments however there also researchers observed that soil freezing causes the decrease of soil salinity arenson sego 2006 baker osterkamp 1989 hou et al 2020 luo et al 2011 chen et al 2018 found that soil salt content decreased by an average of 10 7 during the freeze period and the soil salt was only released from the frozen layer 0 1 m in the early freezing stage by field experiments from 2009 to 2012 bing et al 2015 found that the soil water content in the soil frozen area increased while the soil salt content remained basically unchanged in a one way freezing experiment with red silty clay researchers believed that this was caused by salt being expelled during soil water freezing the above inconsistent conclusions about the soil salt migration during the freeze period indicate the complex mechanism of salt migration which is not only affected by water migration and needed to be further studied previous studies focused on the total amount of soil salt which cannot reflect the impact of types and proportions of soil salt ions gray granger 1986 lin et al 2019 bing ma 2011 tested the soil freezing characteristic curve with different salt types and indicated their different freezing temperature as follows nacl na2co3 na2so4 and kcl nacl cacl2 kruse darrow 2017 tested the liquid water content of soil saturated with kcl nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 solution at low temperature and found the higher unfrozen water content in nacl treated soil these studies illustrate the important impact of various soil salt ions on salt migration due to the solubility of relevant salts and their impact on soil freezing temperature therefore it is necessary to explore the salt migration mechanism from the perspective of soil salt ions while most existing studies were carried out in laboratory by using a single salt and cannot consider the differences and interactions of multiple soil salt ions like field conditions brouchkov 2000 hou et al 2020 sarsembayeva collins 2017 the salt concentration in liquid water increases rapidly during the soil freezing in the field environment when considering the existing form of salts tounsi et al 2020 and salt precipitate would form wan et al 2019 as well as occurring precipitation dissolution reactions robbins 1991 porta 1998 concluded that gypsum is widely present in soil due to its low solubility in water and gypsum can be dissolved in soil water and migrate as the soil solution composition changes in arid and semi arid regions the soil solution is a multi component mixture in which chemical reactions will vary with the concentration of each component and temperature of system for example the presence of specific ions such as mg2 and so4 2 will increase the solubility of salts such as calcium carbonate akin lagerwerf 1965 current researches did not consider salt precipitates or multi ion chemical reactions tounsi et al 2020 added constraints on the change of salt concentration to the numerical simulation equations to keep the salt concentration not exceed the value at saturation the maximum soil salt content monitored by geng and boufadel 2015 was 110 g l in a bare land which was assumed to be lower than the salt solubility limit in their simulation model to exclude the impact of soil salt precipitates and ignore possible chemical reactions among ions to form insoluble substances most models that enable to calculate salt precipitation and dissolution are suitable in positive temperature conditions tavakoli kivi et al 2019 since the dynamic monitoring research on various components of soil solution and salt precipitate at low temperature is limited while soil salt in liquid phase contributes to soil salt movement driving by convection and dispersion effects it is thus important to consider chemical equilibrium of soil solution in soil freezing process for studying the soil water and salt migration researches usually explain the asynchrony of soil water and salt migration during the freeze and thaw period by the combined effects of convection and dispersion liu et al 2021 stähli stadler 1997 liquid soil water content in frozen soil is lower than that in unfrozen soil and the soil salt is enriched in a small amount of liquid water increasing the soil salt concentration to form a concentration gradient between the soil in the frozen and unfrozen areas shafique et al 2016 vrbka jungwirth 2005 wang et al 2016 demonstrated the importance of soil salt diffusion in frozen soil through in situ experiments using tracers the convection effect causes soil salt to migrate with liquid water and the dispersion effect causes soil salt to migrate from high concentration to low concentration these two mechanisms may cause soil salt to migrate in opposite directions stähli stadler 1997 and the distribution of soil salt depends on the relative effect of these two mechanisms most previous studies explained the asynchrony of water and salt through dispersion effect in a qualitative way while not to quantitatively calculate the quantity of salt migration under the convection and dispersion effect quantitative characterization of soil salt migration under convection and dispersion is an important prerequisite for estimation of salt migration during the freeze and thaw period which is the basic theory for establishing soil salt transport numerical models flerchinger and hanson 1989 proposed the shaw model to simulate the transfer of soil heat water and solute by using hourly weather observations the shaw model can simulate multiple solutes simultaneously but the model assumes that solutes do not interact with each other and all solutes exist in the soil solution jansson and karlberg 2004 proposed the coupmodel model to simulate water heat and solute migration of frozen soil coupmodel only considered convection effect when simulating soil salt migration during the freeze and thaw period xu et al 2020 extended harlan model which is a soil water heat coupled model to include the soil salt transport and consider the effect of ice crystal impedance these models are widely used in simulation of soil water and salt migration during freeze and thaw period however the method used base on the convection dispersion effect assumes that all salts dissolved in soil water while salt precipitates during soil freeze due to the significant decrease of liquid soil water causing less salts involved in migration lack of considering the salt precipitates would result in errors in the simulation of solute migration process therefore it is necessary to clarify the salt in solution and precipitates in solid phase by the analysis of the chemical composition of the soil solution during the freeze and thaw period for accurate soil solute transport simulation this study aims to quantitatively analyze the migration capacity of soil water and each soil salt ion during the freeze and thaw period the field experiment was carried out during two freeze and thaw periods from november 2017 to april 2019 the soil temperature soil frozen depth soil water content and content of each soil salt component k na ca mg hco3 co3 c1 and so4 were monitored and measured the soil water and salt content in the liquid and solid phase were split by the calculation of frezchem in which the distribution of liquid soil water and ice as well as soil salt ion concentrations in the soil solution and soil salt precipitates under chemical equilibrium were obtained then the migration trend of liquid soil water and soil salt ions in solution caused by the dynamic effect were simulated by hydrus 1d by comparing the soil water and salt distributions under the chemical equilibrium and dynamic effect the potential migration quantities of soil water and soil salt ions were calculated to analyze the migration direction and capability of soil water and soil salt ions during the freeze and thaw period 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the field experiment the field experiment was carried out in yonglian experimental station 41 04 15 n 108 0 3 e of hetao irrigation district inner mongolia autonomous region china the test area is located in arid region where the average annual rainfall is about 173 mm and the annual average evaporation is about 2096 mm according to the monitoring data of wuyuan meteorological station making farmland vulnerable to soil salinization autumn irrigation is carried out locally to leach soil salt provide suitable soil water and salt environment for spring sowing in the next year tan et al 2021 this area has a five months freeze and thaw period from late november to late april of the next year the soil freeze period is from late november to mid february and the soil thaw period is from mid february to late april the groundwater level rises after autumn irrigation then gradually falls and rises again during the freeze and thaw period as shown in fig 1 b the average maximum depth of frozen soil is about 1 0 m as shown in fig 1b there are 5 soil monitoring sites numbered a c e g and h as shown in fig 1a soil sampling was carried out at the beginning of the freeze period the end of the freeze period and the end of the thaw period the specific sampling time was early december 2017 early february 2018 mid april 2018 late november 2018 mid february 2019 late april 2019 three sample profiles were taken in each monitoring site using a soil extractor produced by yangling xingxing water conservation equipment factory with a 40 mm diameter drill bit to reduce the influence of spatial difference of soil water and salt distribution the soil sample interval was 0 1 m within the soil depth of 0 6 m and 0 2 m from 0 6 m to 2 0 m or the groundwater table depth and the sampling depths are shown in fig 2 each layer of soil was mixed well and approximately 250 g was taken as one soil sample and the average value of three replicate samples was taken as the value of that layer of soil the soil water content was measured by oven drying method using electric blast drying oven model dhg101 2 and electronic balance model sba124 the contents of ca mg and so4 were measured by edta indirect titration method the content of cl was measured by silver nitrate direct titration method the content of hco3 was measured by double indicator neutralization titration method the content of na was calculated by the charge balance principle lu 2000 and the ph of soil was determined by a ph meter model phs 3e soil particle composition was measured using the sedimentation method lu 2000 and the results and soil texture are shown in table 1 mostly silt loam and silt there were 10 auto temperature sensors portable thermometers produced by fuzhou wangyunshan information technology co ltd model wt0t1 and the temperature can be measured ranges from 25 c to 85 c embedded in the soil profile to record soil temperature every 2 h and the burial depths are shown in fig 2 2 2 calculation method of potential salt transport capability the potential salt transport capability was calculated by three steps the first was to calculate the phase change of soil water and salt caused by negative temperature change obtaining the contents of liquid water ice soluble salt and salt precipitates under the effect of chemical equilibrium by frezchem then the movement of liquid soil water and salt in solution under the effects of dynamics convection and diffusion were simulated by hydrus 1d the potential migration quantities of soil water and soil salt ions were calculated by comparing the profiles of soil water and salt ions calculated based on effects of chemical equilibrium and dynamics the calculation process of soil water and salt migration capacity is shown in fig 3 2 2 1 chemical equilibrium calculation of soil solution based on frezchem there are many models used for the simulation of soil solution chemical equilibrium such as phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 unsatchem šimůnek et al 1996 and geochem ez shaff et al 2010 these models are mostly applicable to positive temperature environments and cannot be applied to solutions of high ionic strength the frezchem model is a chemical thermodynamic model which uses pitzer equation to calculate the activity coefficient and activity of water and is suitable for high ionic strength it can be applied to the chemical equilibrium simulation of concentrated electrolyte solution under freezing condition with the temperature between 60 c to 25 c marion et al 2010 this model takes chloride sulfate and bicarbonate carbonate into account and can be used to calculate the chemical equilibrium of na k mg ca h cl so4 oh hco3 co3 co2 h2o system marion 2001 it has been widely used to explore low temperature geochemical processes in the arctic antarctica and mars lyons et al 2005 gaidos and marion 2003 zolotov and shock 2001 therefore the frezchem model was chosen to simulate the chemical equilibrium of soil solution under negative temperature conditions and to quantify the chemical composition of soil solutions during freeze and thaw period in this study 2 2 1 1 theory of frezchem at low temperature the relationship between quantity of liquid water and ice in chemical equilibrium is as follows marion kargel 2007 1 ln k ice ln a w a i μ i 0 μ w 0 rt where kice is the equilibrium constant for liquid water and ice in chemical equilibrium aw is the activity of liquid water ai is the activity of ice and it is equal to 1 0 for pure ice μw 0 is the standard chemical potential of liquid water j mol μ i 0 is the standard chemical potential of ice j mol r is the gas constant j mol k t is the temperature k for the chemical equilibrium of the solution taking the na2so4 10h2o precipitation dissolution reaction as an example 2 na 2 so 4 10 h 2 o 2 na so 4 2 10 h 2 o the formula for calculating the ionic activity product iap is as follows marion kargel 2007 3 iap a na 2 a so 4 2 a w 10 a na 2 so 4 10 h 2 o 4 a n a γ n a m n a a s o 4 2 γ s o 4 2 m s o 4 2 where aj is the activity of component j and the activity of pure solid phase is equal to 1 γj is the activity coefficient of component j which is calculated according to the pitzer equations mj is the molar concentration of component j mol l when the solution is supersaturated with ions the precipitation reaction proceeds and reduces the ionic activity in the solution until to reach equilibrium stage at this time the iap value is equal to ksp the mineral solubility product 2 2 1 2 setup of frezchem there are two assumptions used when setting the frezchem model the first is that solute precipitates from the ice and is enriched in the unfrozen solution during the freezing process in the experiment field soil temperature decreases slowly during soil freezing and the soil cooling rate is about 0 07 c day to 0 10 c day researches show that more than 90 of solutes will precipitate from ice when the soil cooling rate is lower than 0 1 c day konrad mccammon 1990 and the ratio of solute concentration in ice and unfrozen solution is very small with the order of 10 2 10 3 or even lower hoekstra et al 1965 the second is that soil salts are uniformly distributed in soil water excluding the bound water of soil and then the lowest liquid water content under freezing condition is the content of bound water for solution the liquid water content can be reduced to close to 0 at an extremely low temperature which is different in the soil water system there still liquid water exists in frozen soil at extremely low temperature due to the interaction between water and soil particles soil particle adsorption micro pore absorption painter 2011 spaans baker 1996 the lowest liquid water content of frozen soil in the study area is about 0 06 cm3 cm3 wu et al 2015 which is the soil bound water with low solubility xu et al 2010 yang 2005 since the soil is connected to the atmosphere indicating that the solution system is an open system the concentration of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere was taken as the initial value and was set to 0 01 atm then according to measurement data of soil temperature ph of solution partial pressure of co2 and content of each soil salt ion the frezchem model was used to calculate the content of liquid soil water and ice the concentration of each soil salt ion in soil solution and the type and content of each soil precipitate 2 2 2 simulation of soil water and salt migration under dynamic effect based on hydrus 1d there are many soil salt transport models based on convection dispersion equation to describe solute transport processes including hydrus šimůnek et al 2005 swap kroes et al 2009 drainmod s kandil et al 1995 etc the hydrus model proposed by šimůnek et al 2005 is widely used in quantitative description of soil salt transport processes although the model lacks of consideration of crop growth which has a significant impact on soil water and salt transport brunetti et al 2019 2021 shah et al 2022a 2022b it satisfied the requirement of this study since this study addresses the freeze and thaw period after plant harvest during which no plants are grown therefore based on the calculated distribution of liquid soil water content and each salt ion concentration by the frezchem model the hydrus 1d model was then used to simulate soil water and salt migration under dynamic effect to quantify the effects of convection and dispersion mechanisms on salt ion distribution 2 2 2 1 governing equations of hydrus 1d the richards equation is used to describe the one dimensional vertical water movement and the formula is as follows 5 θ t z k h h z 1 where θ is the volume water content of liquid water cm3 cm3 t is the time d k h is the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soil cm d h is soil matrix potential cm z is vertical coordinate cm taking the ground as the origin and positive downward the van genuchten model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 is used to describe the soil moisture characteristic curve and hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soil the equations are as follows 6 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 7 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 8 m 1 1 n n 1 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where θr is the residual volume water content cm3 cm3 θs is the saturated volume moisture content cm3 cm3 ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d se is the relative saturation α is the reciprocal of air entry value cm 1 m is the fitting parameter of soil moisture characteristic curve n is the aperture distribution coefficient l is the parameter that characterizes the pore connectivity of soil and the empirical value is 0 5 beggs et al 2011 soil salt ions transport is affected by convection and hydrodynamic dispersion the model uses convection dispersion equation to describe the salt ions transport as follows nielsen et al 1986 9 θ c i t γ d s i t z θ d i c i z q c i z where ci i na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 is the i th soil salt ion concentration g l γd is the soil bulk density g cm3 si is the absorbed concentration of the i th ion g g di is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient of the i th ion cm2 d q is the vertical water flux cm d 2 2 2 2 setup of hydrus 1d the study area is flat and the lateral runoff is weak so only one dimensional vertical transport is considered in soil water and salt migration therefore the modeling in this study was based on a one dimensional vertical soil profile the length of the simulated area was set as 2 m according to the monitoring depth of the field experiment the initial soil water and salt distribution profiles were taken as the soil water content and salt concentration in the liquid phase at chemical equilibrium in each calculation time due to the small evaporation of frozen soil and low winter rainfall the upper boundary condition was set as non flux boundary the lower boundary was set at the depth of 2 m where very small water interaction happened in this depth during the freeze and thaw period which was also set as non flux boundary as shown in fig 2 the time step was set to 0 00001 day to 1 day the hysteresis effect is not considered since the non flux boundary results in no significant moisture absorption and dehumidification processes in the soil the soil hydraulic parameters are shown in table 2 which are defined based on soil particle composition measured in the field experiment through the neural network prediction module of the hydrus model schaap et al 2001 and adjusted according to other studies carried out in this site cui 2020 yao 2021 the soil solute transport parameters are shown in table 3 the soil bulk density was taken as the average value of 1 45 g cm3 and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient was determined according to previous studies cui 2020 and the molecular diffusion coefficients in free water of each ion were based on measurement of yuan hui gregory 1974 besides the longitudinal dispersion and the molecular diffusion coefficient in free water were set to 0 when simulating the migration process of soil solute under the convection effect only so as to distinguish the effect of convection and diffusion 2 2 3

soil water and salt in liquid phase at chemical equilibrium the distribution of liquid soil water content and soil salt and salt ions concentration in solution in soil profile during the freeze and thaw periods of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 as shown in fig 5a and fig 6a liquid soil water content in frozen soil decreased rapidly with the deepening of soil freezing and there was an obvious difference in liquid water content between frozen soil and unfrozen soil during the freeze and thaw period from 2017 to 2018 the average liquid soil water content in the frozen layer 0 1 m was 0 33 cm3 cm3 on december 06 2017 and decreased to 0 08 cm3 cm3 on february 02 2018 from 2018 to 2019 the average content decreased from 0 41 cm3 cm3 on november 29 2018 to 0 08 cm3 cm3 on february 15 2019 as shown in fig 5b and fig 6b the soil salt concentration in soil solution in the unfrozen area was much lower than that in the frozen area with the decrease of temperature the soil salt solution concentration at the same depth increased significantly on december 06 2017 and november 29 2018 the soil salt solution concentration in the frozen layer 0 1 m was 15 4 g l and 5 5 g l respectively and at the end of the freeze period the soil salt solution concentration within the same depth increased to 86 5 g l and 73 0 g l while the soil salt concentration at the depth of 1 2 m remained basically unchanged which were 4 7 g l and 4 6 g l respectively on december 06 2017 and november 29 2018 and 4 1 g l and 5 1 g l respectively on february 02 2018 and february 15 2019 with the decrease of liquid soil water content the soil salt solution concentration increased variations of different salt ion concentration during the freeze and thaw period were very different the concentrations of various soluble salt ions during freeze and thaw period are shown in fig 7 the average concentrations of cl na and mg2 increased by 14 4 11 5 and 10 0 times than those at the beginning of the freeze period and the average concentrations of so4 2 hco3 and ca2 increased by 5 2 4 1 and 3 5 times indicating that cl na and mg2 are more easily enriched in soil solution in terms of the absolute changes of each salt ion the average concentration of cl and na increased by 33 5 g l and 22 6 g l ranked as the highest and followed by so4 2 with 8 6 g l increase while increase of other soil salt ions were small with mg2 hco3 and ca2 increased by 2 7 g l 1 5 g l and 0 5 g l which indicate that cl na and so4 2 are the main salt ions contributing to the change of soil salt concentration during the freeze period it can be concluded that the decrease of liquid soil water content in frozen soil leads to significant increase of salt solution concentration in which cl na and so4 2 are the main contributive ions in the freeze period 3 2 distribution of soil ice and salt precipitates the distribution of soil ice content and soil salt precipitate content in soil profile are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 and the statistics of soil ice and salt precipitate content excluding the mass of crystal water in the frozen layer 0 1 m during the freeze and thaw period are shown in fig 10 with the decrease of soil temperature and the enrichment of solution salt na2so4 10h2o caso4 2h2o caco3 calcite mgco3 and camg co3 2 were precipitated from soil solution this is consistent with previous studies that common salt precipitates in the soil of arid area include caso4 2h2o caco3 calcite mgco3 and camg co3 2 jones et al 2017 porta 1998 suarez 2005 while sodium sulfate will be rapidly precipitated in the form of mirabilite na2so4 10h2o during the soil freezing process xu et al 2010 during the freeze period a large amount of ice was formed in the frozen soil at the end of the freeze period the soil ice contents in the frozen layer 0 1 m were 367 5 kg m3 and 375 3 kg m3 respectively and melted completely at the end of the thaw period at the beginning and the end of freeze period and at the end of thaw period the average contents of na2so4 10h2o in the frozen layer 0 1 m were 1 5 g m3 695 9 g m3 and 0 g m3 respectively and the average contents of mgco3 were 3 0 g m3 45 8 g m3 and 2 6 g m3 respectively both of which owned very low contents at the beginning of freeze period and at the end of thaw period very high contents at the end of freeze period the change of caso4 2h2o content was similar to those of na2so4 10h2o and mgco3 but with higher value with the average contents in the frozen layer 0 1 m 53 9 g m3 154 4 g m3 and 82 1 g m3 at the beginning of freeze period the end of freeze period and the end of thaw period other soil salt precipitates decreased with the increase of soil depth while caco3 generally increased with the increase of soil depth at the end of freeze period the content of caco3 was 45 4 g m3 lower than those at the beginning of freeze period and at the end of thaw period with the contents of 86 9 g m3 and 65 0 g m3 the content of camg co3 2 was relatively stable in the frozen layer 0 1 m which were 421 4 g m3 at the beginning of freeze period 302 4 g m3 at the end of freeze period and 335 2 g m3 at the end of thaw period it can be concluded that na2so4 10h2o caso4 2h2o caco3 calcite mgco3 and camg co3 2 will precipitate from soil solution during the freeze and thaw period na2so4 10h2o mgco3 and caso4 2h2o are easily affected by low temperature with great increase of content as the soil freezes deeply 3 3 analysis of soil water and salt mobility the proportion of soil water and salt in the liquid phase to the total soil water and salt in the frozen layer 0 1 m during the freeze and thaw period is shown in table 4 the average proportion of liquid soil water in the whole freeze and thaw period was 67 3 and lowest proportion was 16 9 with the variation coefficient 58 9 indicating that the liquid soil water content is susceptible to temperature change the proportion of salt in soil solution was 41 5 80 0 with a smaller variation coefficient 24 4 among the soil salt components the movable part of cl in the freeze and thaw period remained accounting for 100 with no soil salt precipitate containing cl formed due to the low eutectic temperature of chloride salt the eutectic temperatures of nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 are 21 2 c 33 5 c and 49 8 c deng et al 2013 therefore cl is more likely to migrate constituting the main component of soil salt in liquid phase the proportion of movable part of other salt components is greatly different the proportion of na was relatively high accounting for 60 0 to 100 0 with an average of 87 7 which was one of the main salt components of soil solution the proportion of so4 was 98 2 at the highest and 28 3 at the lowest with the variation coefficient 43 9 indicating that the proportion of so4 in liquid phase was greatly affected by the freezing and thawing process this is because the eutectic temperatures of na2so4 h2o and mgso4 h2o solution systems are 1 2 c and 4 8 c respectively ca and hco3 were greatly affected by soil freezing and thawing and the lowest proportion in the liquid phase were 5 6 and 4 2 indicating that when the soil froze to the deepest almost all of the two salt components were precipitated out of the soil solution and no longer migrated with the liquid water the average proportions of ca and hco3 in the liquid phase during the entire freeze and thaw period were 23 7 and 16 5 indicating the weak mobility the proportion of mg in solution was 33 6 to 68 7 with an average of 55 3 and the variation coefficient of 23 5 when the soil was freezing deeply the proportion of mg in soil solution decreased to be precipitated to sum up among the soil salt components cl na and so4 account for high proportion in the soil solution to the total content and are likely to migrate with the liquid soil water ca mg and hco3 are greatly affected by precipitation dissolution reaction of the soil solution with a relatively low proportion in soil solution during the freeze and thaw period 3 4 distribution of soil water and salt under the dynamic effect the distribution of liquid soil water and salt in solution under dynamic effect considering convection dispersion effect and convection effect only of soil salt are shown in fig 11 on december 06 2017 and november 29 2018 the liquid soil water in the upper soil showed a redistribution phenomenon taking december 06 2017 as an example the initial liquid soil water content of 0 0 4 m was low with an average of 0 19 cm3 cm3 and the liquid soil water content of 0 4 m 1 0 m was relatively high with an average of 0 43 cm3 cm3 under the influence of potential soil water gradient the liquid soil water content of 0 4 m 1 0 m migrated to the 0 0 4 m soil layer making the liquid soil water content of 0 0 4 m increase to 0 24 cm3 cm3 and that of 0 4 m 1 0 m decrease to 0 37 cm3 cm3 there was a great difference in liquid soil water content between the upper and lower parts of the frozen front forming a soil water potential gradient driving liquid water move from the lower part to the upper part under the dynamic effect making the distribution of liquid water in the profile more uniform compared with the distribution curve at chemical equilibrium the soil solution concentration of 0 0 4 m under convection effect moved upward as a whole with the upward migration of liquid soil water the solution in the lower part diluted the soil solution in 0 0 4 m resulting in a decrease in the salt concentration from 36 1 g l to 27 9 g l however the distribution of solution concentration on the soil profile was more uniform under the convection dispersion effect and the soil solution concentration of 0 0 4 m showed an obvious downward trend which decreased to 31 0 g l the lower value was formed because the solution concentration gradient between 0 0 4 m soil and the lower soil drove the salt to disperse to the lower soil on february 02 2018 and february 15 2019 compared with the distribution of soil water and salt at chemical equilibrium the content of liquid soil water and salt solution concentration remained unchanged at 0 0 8 m under dynamic effect because the liquid soil water content was low with an average value of 0 08 cm3 cm3 the low soil water content greatly reduced the soil hydraulic conductivity limiting the migration of liquid soil water as well as the soil salt on april 13 2018 and april 30 2019 the distribution of liquid soil water and salt concentration under chemical equilibrium and dynamic effect were basically coincided in which the soil dynamics condition was not greatly affected by the soil freezing it can be concluded that the soil water and salt transport are greatly affected by soil freeze and thaw process soil water potential gradient is formed between frozen and unfrozen soil at low temperature resulting in the obvious redistribution of liquid water under dynamic effect the convection effect makes the soil salt migrate along the direction of liquid soil water and the convection dispersion effect makes the soil salt distribution in the profile more uniform the distributions of soil salt ions in soil solution under dynamic effect considering convection dispersion effect and convection effect only are shown in fig 12 only the results at the beginning and end of the freeze periods were shown herein since the results at the end of the thaw period were very similar to those at the chemical equilibrium it can be found that the distribution of each soil salt ion under dynamic effect was different which was not completely consistent with the distribution of soil salt the distributions of na and cl under dynamic effect were highly similar to that of total salt solution concentration indicating that the migration of na and cl has a great impact on the migration of soil salt this is consistent with our previous study wang et al 2022 that there is a highly strong correlation between the increment of na and cl and the increment of soil salt in the frozen layer 0 1 m the difference between the distribution of soil so4 2 and soil salt concentration under the dynamic effect was mainly reflected at the end of the freeze period at this time the concentration of so4 2 at the frozen front reached to the peak at chemical equilibrium making so4 2 of the frozen front migrate to both two directions thus the decrease of so4 2 concentration in the frozen area under the dynamic effect was lower than those of na and cl the changes of ca2 and mg2 concentration were similar to the soil salt because of their low quantities the concentration difference between the frozen and unfrozen soil was relatively small making the reduction in the frozen area less than those of na cl and so4 2 the distribution of hco3 concentration was quite different from soil salt on november 29 2018 the concentration value of the entire profile was similar its distribution under the dynamic effect was similar to that under the chemical equilibrium it can be concluded that the distribution of each salt ion concentration in solution under the chemical equilibrium and dynamic effect is not completely consistent with soil salt concentration the migration direction of each ion is different due to their different distribution which eventually leads to the complexity of soil salt migration on the macro scale 3 5 potential migration quantity of soil water and salt in the frozen layer the distribution of potential migration quantity of liquid soil water is shown in fig 13 a d and the statistics of potential migration quantity of water in the frozen layer 0 1 m are shown in table 5 at the end of the freeze period as shown in fig 13b and fig 13d the surface soil was frozen deeply and the potential water migration quantity was close to 0 and the potential water migration quantity was positive only in the 0 2 m 0 3 m above the frozen front the soil water redistribution in the profile is mainly caused by phase change of liquid soil water to be ice in the negative temperature which results in large negative matrix potential value in the frozen soil layer then the great potential gradient between frozen and unfrozen soil layers is the major driving force for water redistribution soil water storage within the depth of 0 8 m 1 0 m which was within 0 2 m of soil above the freezing front increased more significantly than those in 0 0 8 m due to the effect of the larger soil water potential gradient between frozen and non frozen soil on december 06 2017 and november 29 2018 the soil water migration quantities in the frozen layer 0 1 m were 1 42 10 2 m3 m3 and 0 22 10 2 m3 m3 indicating the downward movement of the soil water from the frozen layer 0 1 m to the lower part this can be attributed to the high soil water content to recharge the groundwater which was consistent with the saturated state of the lower soil water under the dynamic effect in fig 11 on february 02 2018 and february 15 2019 the soil water migration quantities of the frozen layer 0 1 m were 2 05 10 2 m3 m3 and 2 67 10 2 m3 m3 indicating the upward movement of soil water from the unfrozen soil to the frozen soil this is because that the soil water potential gradient between the frozen area and the unfrozen area further increased with the freezing process resulting in intensified redistribution and increased potential migration of soil water in the frozen layer the distribution of potential convection and dispersion quantity of soil salt in each soil layer is shown in fig 13e h and fig 13i l respectively and the statistics of potential migration quantity of soil salt in the frozen layer 0 1 m are shown in table 5 the distribution of potential convection quantity of soil salt in the soil profile was similar to the potential migration quantity of liquid soil water the soil salt tended to increase in the soil layer where soil water accumulated under convection effect and decrease where soil water reduced for example on december 06 2017 liquid soil water moved from 0 4 m 1 0 m to soil layers with depth of 0 0 4 m and below 1 0 m causing a decrease in soil salt of 0 3 m 1 1 m and the salt accumulation at layers of 0 0 3 m and below 1 1 m for the potential dispersion quantity of soil salt the soil salt content in the frozen area decreased and salt accumulated in the unfrozen area for example on december 06 2017 the soil frozen depth was 0 36 m and fig 13i shows that the soil salt decreased at layers of 0 0 3 m while accumulated in the soil layers of 0 3 m 0 7 m which was the result of soil salt transport from the upper soil of the frozen front to the lower part under the dispersion effect the statistics of potential migration quantity of soil salt under the convection dispersion effect in the frozen layer 0 1 m are shown in table 5 the soil salt migration quantity in the frozen layer 0 1 m were 98 7 g m3 and 11 2 g m3 on december 06 2017 and november 29 2018 and 44 4 g m3 and 86 2 g m3 at the end of the two freeze periods indicating that the soil salt content in the frozen layer showed a decrease trend first and then increase during the freeze period the potential migration quantity of soil salt is the sum of potential convection quantity and potential dispersion quantity under the convection effect the soil salt migration quantity in the frozen layer 0 1 m on december 06 2017 and november 29 2018 were 100 7 g m3 and 12 2 g m3 respectively corresponding to the decrease of soil water storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m at this time the potential dispersion quantity of soil salt in the frozen layer 0 1 m were 2 1 g m3 and 1 0 g m3 the soil salt content in the frozen layer 0 1 m was basically unchanged under the dispersion effect due to the small frozen area at the beginning of the freeze period and the dispersion effect was weak to remove the soil salt in the frozen layer 0 1 m it can be concluded that the soil salt migration was dominated by the convection effect at the beginning of the freeze period under the convection effect the soil salt migration quantity in the frozen layer 0 1 m on february 02 2018 and february 15 2019 were 311 7 g m3 and 306 4 g m3 at this time the frozen area was wide with the deep frozen soil resulting in the soil salt concentration gradients of 89 0 g l m and 68 2 g l m between the frozen layer 0 1 m and the unfrozen layer 1 2 m the soil salt migrated to the unfrozen layer under the high salt concentration gradient with the potential dispersion quantity of soil salt in the frozen layer 0 1 m 267 2 g m3 and 220 2 g m3 at the end of the freeze period the convection effect caused the accumulation of soil salt in the frozen layer 0 1 m while the diffusion effect caused the soil salt content to decrease the relative strong convection effect causes the increase of the soil salt content in the frozen layer 0 1 m at the end of freeze period the phase change of soil water and soil salt results in small liquid soil water content and high salt concentration in the frozen layer causing a high concentration gradient between frozen and unfrozen soil which contributes greatly to soil salt transport in frozen soils chen et al 2018 conducted an experiment monitoring soil salt content in the frozen layer 0 1 m during the freeze and thaw period in the same research area and found that soil salt was only removed from 0 to 1 m soil in the early stage of the freeze period which was consistent with the results of this study yasin et al 2017 attributed the accumulation of soil salt during the freeze period to the continuous upward movement of soil water caused by the extremely low soil water potential of the overlying frozen soil and the movement of soil salt with soil water resulted in the accumulation of salt in the frozen soil although the soil water and salt calculated in this study tended to increase in the frozen layer which was consistent with the results of yasin et al 2017 decrease or increase of soil salt is actual determined by the combined influence of convection and dispersion and the soil salt dispersion effect cannot be ignored in certain conditions with stronger dispersion effect desalinization can occur in the frozen soil 3 6 salt ions contribution to the migration quantity of soil salt in the frozen layer the potential convection and dispersion quantity of soil salt ions in soil solution na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 are shown in fig 13e h and i l respectively and the potential migration quantity of soil salt ions in the frozen layer 0 1 m is shown in table 5 and statistics of the soil salt ion concentration gradient between the frozen layer 0 1 m and the unfrozen layer 1 2 m are shown in table 6 the potential migration quantities of na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 4 in the frozen layer 0 1 m on december 06 2017 were 28 1 g m3 2 5 g m3 1 9 g m3 9 1 g m3 21 3 g m3 and 35 8 g m3 and values on november 29 2018 were 3 1 g m3 0 1 g m3 0 4 g m3 1 4 g m3 2 3 g m3 and 4 0 g m3 indicating that most soil salt ions were likely to detach from the frozen layer 0 1 m at the beginning of the freeze period since the frozen depth on november 29 2018 was small about 0 18 m the redistribution of salt ions in the frozen layer 0 1 m was not obvious the potential migration quantities of na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 in the frozen layer 0 1 m on february 02 2018 were 8 2 g m3 3 0 g m3 2 3 g m3 9 2 g m3 10 9 g m3 and 10 9 g m3 and values on february 15 2019 were 19 7 g m3 3 6 g m3 2 8 g m3 14 7 g m3 10 3 g m3 and 35 1 g m3 indicating that soil salt ions accumulated in the frozen soil layer 0 1 m at the end of freeze period it can be concluded that the migration directions of all soil salt ions under the effect of convection and dispersion were relatively consistent but there are great differences in the migration quantities the contribution of different ions to the potential convection and potential dispersion quantities are shown in table 7 the mean values of potential convection quantity of hco3 mg2 and ca2 to that of soil salt were 5 7 1 8 and 1 4 and the mean values of potential dispersion quantity were 0 5 1 3 and 2 4 indicating that the migration quantity of soil salt under the effect of convection and dispersion was less affected by hco3 mg2 and ca2 the mean values of potential convection quantity of so4 2 na and cl to that of soil salt were 39 6 30 0 and 21 4 and the mean values of potential dispersion quantity were 41 3 32 2 and 22 3 indicating that the migration quantity of soil salt under the effect of convection and dispersion was greatly affected by so4 2 na and cl the higher contribution of so4 2 na and cl to the convection effect is due to the higher content of so4 na and cl in soil and so4 2 na and cl were not easy to precipitate from the soil solution with the content in liquid phase accounts for more than 74 5 of the total content of soil salt components owning the larger migration ability during the freeze and thaw period the great difference in the potential dispersion quantity of different kinds of salt ion were not only caused by the difference in the ion concentrations in solution but also by the difference in the concentration gradients between the frozen layer 0 1 m and the unfrozen layer 1 2 m the concentration gradient values were cl na so4 2 mg2 ca2 hco3 and those of cl na and so4 2 were much higher than mg2 ca2 and hco3 meanwhile the diffusion coefficients of cl na and so4 2 in free soil water are 1 209 cm2 d 0 783 cm2 d and 0 619 cm2 d higher than those of ca2 and mg2 with 0 466 cm2 d and 0 422 cm2 d the diffusion coefficient of hco3 in free soil water was 0 692 cm2 d which is between na and so4 2 however the small soluble concentration and low concentration gradient of hco3 caused the small dispersion quantity than cl na and so4 2 in total the potential migration quantities of na cl and so4 2 under the effect of convection and dispersion were higher than those of ca2 mg2 and hco3 this is consistent with the results that the ion increments of na cl and so4 2 were higher than those of ca2 and mg2 through field observation experiments of soil salt migration in frozen soil found by kang et al 1994 gray and granger 1986 also observed in situ experiment that salt accumulation in frozen soils was mainly composed of sodium and magnesium sulfates in conclusion the soil salt ions in the frozen layer 0 1 m showed a tendency to be released and accumulated at the beginning and end of the freeze period respectively due to the differences in ion solubility concentrations concentration gradients and diffusion coefficients the potential convection and dispersion quantities of na cl and so4 2 are higher than those of ca2 mg2 and hco3 moreover the convection and dispersion effect make soil salt ions migrate in different directions resulting in differences in salt migration directions and quantities 4 conclusions in this paper the potential migration quantities of soil water and salt as well as salt ions in the frozen soil were simulated on the basis of the distribution of soil water and salt ions in liquid and solid phases and the migration direction and capability of soil water and salt ions in freeze period were analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 the chemical reactions between soil salt ions are more complex after soil freezing due to the phase change caused by negative temperature among the soil salt components cl na and so4 are less affected by precipitation dissolution reaction because of their low eutectic points so they constitute the main components of liquid soil salt and therefore are more likely to migrate with the liquid soil water than ca mg and hco3 2 according to the potential migration quantity of liquid soil water and various salt ions in soil solution under dynamic effect the soil water salt and salt ions content in the frozen layer tend to decrease at the beginning of the freeze period and tend to accumulate at the end of the freeze period 3 the accumulation or reduction of soil salinity in the frozen layer depends on the direction and quantity of salt ions under convection and dispersion and the dispersion cannot be ignored 4 na cl and so4 2 constitute the main part of the potential migration quantity of soil salt due to their higher proportion in

1854,current researches on estimating soil salt movement during the freeze and thaw period are mainly based on total salt concentration while ignoring the phase change of multi component salts in this study the potential transport capability of soil water and salt ions in the frozen layer was investigated based on chemical characteristics and solute convection diffusion theory field experiments were implemented to measure the change of total soil water soil salt and its ion components the soil water and salt content in liquid and solid phases were calculated by the frezchem model and then the movement of liquid soil water and soluble salt were simulated by the hydrus 1d model the potential migration capability of soil water and salt components were then estimated by comparing the distribution profiles obtained by hydrus 1d and frezchem the results show that more than 74 5 of cl na and so4 were in liquid phase which were less affected by precipitation dissolution reaction and owned strong mitigation the liquid soil water soluble salt and salt ions in the frozen layer tended to decrease at the beginning of the freeze period and increase significantly at the end the migration direction and quantity of various salt ions were different due to their concentration gradient and diffusion coefficient causing the larger potential convection and dispersion quantity of na cl and so4 2 than those of ca2 mg2 and hco3 this study provides a new perspective for soil salt movement in frozen soil in agricultural areas with shallow groundwater table depth keywords freeze and

consistent perspective on soil water movement is that soil water migrates from unfrozen soil to frozen soil along the direction of decreasing temperature which increases the soil water content of frozen soil hoekstra et al 1965 wang et al 2019 zhang sun 2011 sweidan et al 2022 the soil salt migration direction is more complicated than soil water during the freeze period some researchers observed salt accumulation in frozen soil campbell et al 1970 rima beier 2018 wan et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 and attributed it to the fact that liquid soil water carries soil salt to migrate to frozen soil cary mayland 1972 observed the movement of cacl2 lii and k2so4 in unsaturated frozen soil column under temperature gradient in the laboratory and found that the salts all moved from the warmer region to the cooler region qin et al 2021 monitored the change of soil water and salt content in songnen plain of china during the freeze and thaw period and found salt enrichment in the frozen soil wan et al 2019 also found that soil salt ions migrated from the warm end to the cold end in the low temperature sodium sulfate soil by laboratory experiments however there also researchers observed that soil freezing causes the decrease of soil salinity arenson sego 2006 baker osterkamp 1989 hou et al 2020 luo et al 2011 chen et al 2018 found that soil salt content decreased by an average of 10 7 during the freeze period and the soil salt was only released from the frozen layer 0 1 m in the early freezing stage by field experiments from 2009 to 2012 bing et al 2015 found that the soil water content in the soil frozen area increased while the soil salt content remained basically unchanged in a one way freezing experiment with red silty clay researchers believed that this was caused by salt being expelled during soil water freezing the above inconsistent conclusions about the soil salt migration during the freeze period indicate the complex mechanism of salt migration which is not only affected by water migration and needed to be further studied previous studies focused on the total amount of soil salt which cannot reflect the impact of types and proportions of soil salt ions gray granger 1986 lin et al 2019 bing ma 2011 tested the soil freezing characteristic curve with different salt types and indicated their different freezing temperature as follows nacl na2co3 na2so4 and kcl nacl cacl2 kruse darrow 2017 tested the liquid water content of soil saturated with kcl nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 solution at low temperature and found the higher unfrozen water content in nacl treated soil these studies illustrate the important impact of various soil salt ions on salt migration due to the solubility of relevant salts and their impact on soil freezing temperature therefore it is necessary to explore the salt migration mechanism from the perspective of soil salt ions while most existing studies were carried out in laboratory by using a single salt and cannot consider the differences and interactions of multiple soil salt ions like field conditions brouchkov 2000 hou et al 2020 sarsembayeva collins 2017 the salt concentration in liquid water increases rapidly during the soil freezing in the field environment when considering the existing form of salts tounsi et al 2020 and salt precipitate would form wan et al 2019 as well as occurring precipitation dissolution reactions robbins 1991 porta 1998 concluded that gypsum is widely present in soil due to its low solubility in water and gypsum can be dissolved in soil water and migrate as the soil solution composition changes in arid and semi arid regions the soil solution is a multi component mixture in which chemical reactions will vary with the concentration of each component and temperature of system for example the presence of specific ions such as mg2 and so4 2 will increase the solubility of salts such as calcium carbonate akin lagerwerf 1965 current researches did not consider salt precipitates or multi ion chemical reactions tounsi et al 2020 added constraints on the change of salt concentration to the numerical simulation equations to keep the salt concentration not exceed the value at saturation the maximum soil salt content monitored by geng and boufadel 2015 was 110 g l in a bare land which was assumed to be lower than the salt solubility limit in their simulation model to exclude the impact of soil salt precipitates and ignore possible chemical reactions among ions to form insoluble substances most models that enable to calculate salt precipitation and dissolution are suitable in positive temperature conditions tavakoli kivi et al 2019 since the dynamic monitoring research on various components of soil solution and salt precipitate at low temperature is limited while soil salt in liquid phase contributes to soil salt movement driving by convection and dispersion effects it is thus important to consider chemical equilibrium of soil solution in soil freezing process for studying the soil water and salt migration researches usually explain the asynchrony of soil water and salt migration during the freeze and thaw period by the combined effects of convection and dispersion liu et al 2021 stähli stadler 1997 liquid soil water content in frozen soil is lower than that in unfrozen soil and the soil salt is enriched in a small amount of liquid water increasing the soil salt concentration to form a concentration gradient between the soil in the frozen and unfrozen areas shafique et al 2016 vrbka jungwirth 2005 wang et al 2016 demonstrated the importance of soil salt diffusion in frozen soil through in situ experiments using tracers the convection effect causes soil salt to migrate with liquid water and the dispersion effect causes soil salt to migrate from high concentration to low concentration these two mechanisms may cause soil salt to migrate in opposite directions stähli stadler 1997 and the distribution of soil salt depends on the relative effect of these two mechanisms most previous studies explained the asynchrony of water and salt through dispersion effect in a qualitative way while not to quantitatively calculate the quantity of salt migration under the convection and dispersion effect quantitative characterization of soil salt migration under convection and dispersion is an important prerequisite for estimation of salt migration during the freeze and thaw period which is the basic theory for establishing soil salt transport numerical models flerchinger and hanson 1989 proposed the shaw model to simulate the transfer of soil heat water and solute by using hourly weather observations the shaw model can simulate multiple solutes simultaneously but the model assumes that solutes do not interact with each other and all solutes exist in the soil solution jansson and karlberg 2004 proposed the coupmodel model to simulate water heat and solute migration of frozen soil coupmodel only considered convection effect when simulating soil salt migration during the freeze and thaw period xu et al 2020 extended harlan model which is a soil water heat coupled model to include the soil salt transport and consider the effect of ice crystal impedance these models are widely used in simulation of soil water and salt migration during freeze and thaw period however the method used base on the convection dispersion effect assumes that all salts dissolved in soil water while salt precipitates during soil freeze due to the significant decrease of liquid soil water causing less salts involved in migration lack of considering the salt precipitates would result in errors in the simulation of solute migration process therefore it is necessary to clarify the salt in solution and precipitates in solid phase by the analysis of the chemical composition of the soil solution during the freeze and thaw period for accurate soil solute transport simulation this study aims to quantitatively analyze the migration capacity of soil water and each soil salt ion during the freeze and thaw period the field experiment was carried out during two freeze and thaw periods from november 2017 to april 2019 the soil temperature soil frozen depth soil water content and content of each soil salt component k na ca mg hco3 co3 c1 and so4 were monitored and measured the soil water and salt content in the liquid and solid phase were split by the calculation of frezchem in which the distribution of liquid soil water and ice as well as soil salt ion concentrations in the soil solution and soil salt precipitates under chemical equilibrium were obtained then the migration trend of liquid soil water and soil salt ions in solution caused by the dynamic effect were simulated by hydrus 1d by comparing the soil water and salt distributions under the chemical equilibrium and dynamic effect the potential migration quantities of soil water and soil salt ions were calculated to analyze the migration direction and capability of soil water and soil salt ions during the freeze and thaw period 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the field experiment the field experiment was carried out in yonglian experimental station 41 04 15 n 108 0 3 e of hetao irrigation district inner mongolia autonomous region china the test area is located in arid region where the average annual rainfall is about 173 mm and the annual average evaporation is about 2096 mm according to the monitoring data of wuyuan meteorological station making farmland vulnerable to soil salinization autumn irrigation is carried out locally to leach soil salt provide suitable soil water and salt environment for spring sowing in the next year tan et al 2021 this area has a five months freeze and thaw period from late november to late april of the next year the soil freeze period is from late november to mid february and the soil thaw period is from mid february to late april the groundwater level rises after autumn irrigation then gradually falls and rises again during the freeze and thaw period as shown in fig 1 b the average maximum depth of frozen soil is about 1 0 m as shown in fig 1b there are 5 soil monitoring sites numbered a c e g and h as shown in fig 1a soil sampling was carried out at the beginning of the freeze period the end of the freeze period and the end of the thaw period the specific sampling time was early december 2017 early february 2018 mid april 2018 late november 2018 mid february 2019 late april 2019 three sample profiles were taken in each monitoring site using a soil extractor produced by yangling xingxing water conservation equipment factory with a 40 mm diameter drill bit to reduce the influence of spatial difference of soil water and salt distribution the soil sample interval was 0 1 m within the soil depth of 0 6 m and 0 2 m from 0 6 m to 2 0 m or the groundwater table depth and the sampling depths are shown in fig 2 each layer of soil was mixed well and approximately 250 g was taken as one soil sample and the average value of three replicate samples was taken as the value of that layer of soil the soil water content was measured by oven drying method using electric blast drying oven model dhg101 2 and electronic balance model sba124 the contents of ca mg and so4 were measured by edta indirect titration method the content of cl was measured by silver nitrate direct titration method the content of hco3 was measured by double indicator neutralization titration method the content of na was calculated by the charge balance principle lu 2000 and the ph of soil was determined by a ph meter model phs 3e soil particle composition was measured using the sedimentation method lu 2000 and the results and soil texture are shown in table 1 mostly silt loam and silt there were 10 auto temperature sensors portable thermometers produced by fuzhou wangyunshan information technology co ltd model wt0t1 and the temperature can be measured ranges from 25 c to 85 c embedded in the soil profile to record soil temperature every 2 h and the burial depths are shown in fig 2 2 2 calculation method of potential salt transport capability the potential salt transport capability was calculated by three steps the first was to calculate the phase change of soil water and salt caused by negative temperature change obtaining the contents of liquid water ice soluble salt and salt precipitates under the effect of chemical equilibrium by frezchem then the movement of liquid soil water and salt in solution under the effects of dynamics convection and diffusion were simulated by hydrus 1d the potential migration quantities of soil water and soil salt ions were calculated by comparing the profiles of soil water and salt ions calculated based on effects of chemical equilibrium and dynamics the calculation process of soil water and salt migration capacity is shown in fig 3 2 2 1 chemical equilibrium calculation of soil solution based on frezchem there are many models used for the simulation of soil solution chemical equilibrium such as phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 unsatchem šimůnek et al 1996 and geochem ez shaff et al 2010 these models are mostly applicable to positive temperature environments and cannot be applied to solutions of high ionic strength the frezchem model is a chemical thermodynamic model which uses pitzer equation to calculate the activity coefficient and activity of water and is suitable for high ionic strength it can be applied to the chemical equilibrium simulation of concentrated electrolyte solution under freezing condition with the temperature between 60 c to 25 c marion et al 2010 this model takes chloride sulfate and bicarbonate carbonate into account and can be used to calculate the chemical equilibrium of na k mg ca h cl so4 oh hco3 co3 co2 h2o system marion 2001 it has been widely used to explore low temperature geochemical processes in the arctic antarctica and mars lyons et al 2005 gaidos and marion 2003 zolotov and shock 2001 therefore the frezchem model was chosen to simulate the chemical equilibrium of soil solution under negative temperature conditions and to quantify the chemical composition of soil solutions during freeze and thaw period in this study 2 2 1 1 theory of frezchem at low temperature the relationship between quantity of liquid water and ice in chemical equilibrium is as follows marion kargel 2007 1 ln k ice ln a w a i μ i 0 μ w 0 rt where kice is the equilibrium constant for liquid water and ice in chemical equilibrium aw is the activity of liquid water ai is the activity of ice and it is equal to 1 0 for pure ice μw 0 is the standard chemical potential of liquid water j mol μ i 0 is the standard chemical potential of ice j mol r is the gas constant j mol k t is the temperature k for the chemical equilibrium of the solution taking the na2so4 10h2o precipitation dissolution reaction as an example 2 na 2 so 4 10 h 2 o 2 na so 4 2 10 h 2 o the formula for calculating the ionic activity product iap is as follows marion kargel 2007 3 iap a na 2 a so 4 2 a w 10 a na 2 so 4 10 h 2 o 4 a n a γ n a m n a a s o 4 2 γ s o 4 2 m s o 4 2 where aj is the activity of component j and the activity of pure solid phase is equal to 1 γj is the activity coefficient of component j which is calculated according to the pitzer equations mj is the molar concentration of component j mol l when the solution is supersaturated with ions the precipitation reaction proceeds and reduces the ionic activity in the solution until to reach equilibrium stage at this time the iap value is equal to ksp the mineral solubility product 2 2 1 2 setup of frezchem there are two assumptions used when setting the frezchem model the first is that solute precipitates from the ice and is enriched in the unfrozen solution during the freezing process in the experiment field soil temperature decreases slowly during soil freezing and the soil cooling rate is about 0 07 c day to 0 10 c day researches show that more than 90 of solutes will precipitate from ice when the soil cooling rate is lower than 0 1 c day konrad mccammon 1990 and the ratio of solute concentration in ice and unfrozen solution is very small with the order of 10 2 10 3 or even lower hoekstra et al 1965 the second is that soil salts are uniformly distributed in soil water excluding the bound water of soil and then the lowest liquid water content under freezing condition is the content of bound water for solution the liquid water content can be reduced to close to 0 at an extremely low temperature which is different in the soil water system there still liquid water exists in frozen soil at extremely low temperature due to the interaction between water and soil particles soil particle adsorption micro pore absorption painter 2011 spaans baker 1996 the lowest liquid water content of frozen soil in the study area is about 0 06 cm3 cm3 wu et al 2015 which is the soil bound water with low solubility xu et al 2010 yang 2005 since the soil is connected to the atmosphere indicating that the solution system is an open system the concentration of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere was taken as the initial value and was set to 0 01 atm then according to measurement data of soil temperature ph of solution partial pressure of co2 and content of each soil salt ion the frezchem model was used to calculate the content of liquid soil water and ice the concentration of each soil salt ion in soil solution and the type and content of each soil precipitate 2 2 2 simulation of soil water and salt migration under dynamic effect based on hydrus 1d there are many soil salt transport models based on convection dispersion equation to describe solute transport processes including hydrus šimůnek et al 2005 swap kroes et al 2009 drainmod s kandil et al 1995 etc the hydrus model proposed by šimůnek et al 2005 is widely used in quantitative description of soil salt transport processes although the model lacks of consideration of crop growth which has a significant impact on soil water and salt transport brunetti et al 2019 2021 shah et al 2022a 2022b it satisfied the requirement of this study since this study addresses the freeze and thaw period after plant harvest during which no plants are grown therefore based on the calculated distribution of liquid soil water content and each salt ion concentration by the frezchem model the hydrus 1d model was then used to simulate soil water and salt migration under dynamic effect to quantify the effects of convection and dispersion mechanisms on salt ion distribution 2 2 2 1 governing equations of hydrus 1d the richards equation is used to describe the one dimensional vertical water movement and the formula is as follows 5 θ t z k h h z 1 where θ is the volume water content of liquid water cm3 cm3 t is the time d k h is the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soil cm d h is soil matrix potential cm z is vertical coordinate cm taking the ground as the origin and positive downward the van genuchten model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 is used to describe the soil moisture characteristic curve and hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soil the equations are as follows 6 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 7 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 8 m 1 1 n n 1 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where θr is the residual volume water content cm3 cm3 θs is the saturated volume moisture content cm3 cm3 ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d se is the relative saturation α is the reciprocal of air entry value cm 1 m is the fitting parameter of soil moisture characteristic curve n is the aperture distribution coefficient l is the parameter that characterizes the pore connectivity of soil and the empirical value is 0 5 beggs et al 2011 soil salt ions transport is affected by convection and hydrodynamic dispersion the model uses convection dispersion equation to describe the salt ions transport as follows nielsen et al 1986 9 θ c i t γ d s i t z θ d i c i z q c i z where ci i na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 is the i th soil salt ion concentration g l γd is the soil bulk density g cm3 si is the absorbed concentration of the i th ion g g di is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient of the i th ion cm2 d q is the vertical water flux cm d 2 2 2 2 setup of hydrus 1d the study area is flat and the lateral runoff is weak so only one dimensional vertical transport is considered in soil water and salt migration therefore the modeling in this study was based on a one dimensional vertical soil profile the length of the simulated area was set as 2 m according to the monitoring depth of the field experiment the initial soil water and salt distribution profiles were taken as the soil water content and salt concentration in the liquid phase at chemical equilibrium in each calculation time due to the small evaporation of frozen soil and low winter rainfall the upper boundary condition was set as non flux boundary the lower boundary was set at the depth of 2 m where very small water interaction happened in this depth during the freeze and thaw period which was also set as non flux boundary as shown in fig 2 the time step was set to 0 00001 day to 1 day the hysteresis effect is not considered since the non flux boundary results in no significant moisture absorption and dehumidification processes in the soil the soil hydraulic parameters are shown in table 2 which are defined based on soil particle composition measured in the field experiment through the neural network prediction module of the hydrus model schaap et al 2001 and adjusted according to other studies carried out in this site cui 2020 yao 2021 the soil solute transport parameters are shown in table 3 the soil bulk density was taken as the average value of 1 45 g cm3 and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient was determined according to previous studies cui 2020 and the molecular diffusion coefficients in free water of each ion were based on measurement of yuan hui gregory 1974 besides the longitudinal dispersion and the molecular diffusion coefficient in free water were set to 0 when simulating the migration process of soil solute under the convection effect only so as to distinguish the effect of convection and diffusion 2 2 3 calculation method for potential migration quantity of soil water and salts the calculation formulas for storage of liquid soil water soil salt and ions in soil solution at chemical equilibrium and under dynamic effect and storage of soil salt precipitate at chemical equilibrium per unit volume within a certain depth are as follows 10 w chem k 1 n d k θ chem k k 1 n d k 11 w dyn k 1 n d k θ dyn k k 1 n d k 12 s chem k 1 n d k c chem k θ chem k k 1 n d k 13 s d y n 1 k 1 n d k c d y n 1 k θ dyn k k 1 n d k 14 s d y n 2 k 1 n d k c d y n 2 k θ dyn k k 1 n d k 15 sed k 1 n d k s e d k θ tot k k

the k th soil layer cm3 cm3 the schematic diagram of the calculation method for the potential migration quantity of liquid soil water characterizing the migration capability of liquid soil water is shown in fig 4 b and the calculation formula is as follows 16 q w dyn w chem where q is the potential migration quantity of liquid soil water m3 m3 a positive value of q indicates that the liquid water storage in the soil layer increases under the dynamic effect while a negative value indicates that the liquid water storage in the soil layer decreases under the dynamic effect the schematic diagram of calculation method for the potential migration quantity potential convection quantity potential dispersion quantity of soil salt or ions of soil solution are shown in fig 4d f and the calculation formulas are as follows 17 sq s d y n 1 s chem 18 s q con s d y n 2 s chem 19 s q dis s d y n 1 s d y n 2 where sq is the potential migration quantity of soil salt or ions in solution under dynamic effect kg m3 sqcon and sqdis are potential convection quantity and potential dispersion quantity of soil salt or ions in solution kg m3 the positive values of sq sqcon and sqdis indicate that the storage of salt or ions in the soil layer increases while negative values indicate that the storage of salt or ions in the soil layer decreases 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of soil water and salt in liquid phase at chemical equilibrium the distribution of liquid soil water content and soil salt and salt ions concentration in solution in soil profile during the freeze and thaw periods of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 as shown in fig 5a and fig 6a liquid soil water content in frozen soil decreased rapidly with the deepening of soil freezing and there was an obvious difference in liquid water content between frozen soil and unfrozen soil during the freeze and thaw period from 2017 to 2018 the average liquid soil water content in the frozen layer 0 1 m was 0 33 cm3 cm3 on december 06 2017 and decreased to 0 08 cm3 cm3 on february 02 2018 from 2018 to 2019 the average content decreased from 0 41 cm3 cm3 on november 29 2018 to 0 08 cm3 cm3 on february 15 2019 as shown in fig 5b and fig 6b the soil salt concentration in soil solution in the unfrozen area was much lower than that in the frozen area with the decrease of temperature the soil salt solution concentration at the same depth increased significantly on december 06 2017 and november 29 2018 the soil salt solution concentration in the frozen layer 0 1 m was 15 4 g l and 5 5 g l respectively and at the end of the freeze period the soil salt solution concentration within the same depth increased to 86 5 g l and 73 0 g l while the soil salt concentration at the depth of 1 2 m remained basically unchanged which were 4 7 g l and 4 6 g l respectively on december 06 2017 and november 29 2018 and 4 1 g l and 5 1 g l respectively on february 02 2018 and february 15 2019 with the decrease of liquid soil water content the soil salt solution concentration increased variations of different salt ion concentration during the freeze and thaw period were very different the concentrations of various soluble salt ions during freeze and thaw period are shown in fig 7 the average concentrations of cl na and mg2 increased by 14 4 11 5 and 10 0 times than those at the beginning of the freeze period and the average concentrations of so4 2 hco3 and ca2 increased by 5 2 4 1 and 3 5 times indicating that cl na and mg2 are more easily enriched in soil solution in terms of the absolute changes of each salt ion the average concentration of cl and na increased by 33 5 g l and 22 6 g l ranked as the highest and followed by so4 2 with 8 6 g l increase while increase of other soil salt ions were small with mg2 hco3 and ca2 increased by 2 7 g l 1 5 g l and 0 5 g l which indicate that cl na and so4 2 are the main salt ions contributing to the change of soil salt concentration during the freeze period it can be concluded that the decrease of liquid soil water content in frozen soil leads to significant increase of salt solution concentration in which cl na and so4 2 are the main contributive ions in the freeze period 3 2 distribution of soil ice and salt precipitates the distribution of soil ice content and soil salt precipitate content in soil profile are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 and the statistics of soil ice and salt precipitate content excluding the mass of crystal water in the frozen layer 0 1 m during the freeze and thaw period are shown in fig 10 with the decrease of soil temperature and the enrichment of solution salt na2so4 10h2o caso4 2h2o caco3 calcite mgco3 and camg co3 2 were precipitated from soil solution this is consistent with previous studies that common salt precipitates in the soil of arid area include caso4 2h2o caco3 calcite mgco3 and camg co3 2 jones et al 2017 porta 1998 suarez 2005 while sodium sulfate will be rapidly precipitated in the form of mirabilite na2so4 10h2o during the soil freezing process xu et al 2010 during the freeze period a large amount of ice was formed in the frozen soil at the end of the freeze period the soil ice contents in the frozen layer 0 1 m were 367 5 kg m3 and 375 3 kg m3 respectively and melted completely at the end of the thaw period at the beginning and the end of freeze period and at the end of thaw period the average contents of na2so4 10h2o in the frozen layer 0 1 m were 1 5 g m3 695 9 g m3 and 0 g m3 respectively and the average contents of mgco3 were 3 0 g m3 45 8 g m3 and 2 6 g m3 respectively both of which owned very low contents at the beginning of freeze period and at the end of thaw period very high contents at the end of freeze period the change of caso4 2h2o content was similar to those of na2so4 10h2o and mgco3 but with higher value with the average contents in the frozen layer 0 1 m 53 9 g m3 154 4 g m3 and 82 1 g m3 at the beginning of freeze period the end of freeze period and the end of thaw period other soil salt precipitates decreased with the increase of soil depth while caco3 generally increased with the increase of soil depth at the end of freeze period the content of caco3 was 45 4 g m3 lower than those at the beginning of freeze period and at the end of thaw period with the contents of 86 9 g m3 and 65 0 g m3 the content of camg co3 2 was relatively stable in the frozen layer 0 1 m which were 421 4 g m3 at the beginning of freeze period 302 4 g m3 at the end of freeze period and 335 2 g m3 at the end of thaw period it can be concluded that na2so4 10h2o caso4 2h2o caco3 calcite mgco3 and camg co3 2 will precipitate from soil solution during the freeze and thaw period na2so4 10h2o mgco3 and caso4 2h2o are easily affected by low temperature with great increase of content as the soil freezes deeply 3 3 analysis of soil water and salt mobility the proportion of soil water and salt in the liquid phase to the total soil water and salt in the frozen layer 0 1 m during the freeze and thaw period is shown in table 4 the average proportion of liquid soil water in the whole freeze and thaw period was 67 3 and lowest proportion was 16 9 with the variation coefficient 58 9 indicating that the liquid soil water content is susceptible to temperature change the proportion of salt in soil solution was 41 5 80 0 with a smaller variation coefficient 24 4 among the soil salt components the movable part of cl in the freeze and thaw period remained accounting for 100 with no soil salt precipitate containing cl formed due to the low eutectic temperature of chloride salt the eutectic temperatures of nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 are 21 2 c 33 5 c and 49 8 c deng et al 2013 therefore cl is more likely to migrate constituting the main component of soil salt in liquid phase the proportion of movable part of other salt components is greatly different the proportion of na was relatively high accounting for 60 0 to 100 0 with an average of 87 7 which was one of the main salt components of soil solution the proportion of so4 was 98 2 at the highest and 28 3 at the lowest with the variation coefficient 43 9 indicating that the proportion of so4 in liquid phase was greatly affected by the freezing and thawing process this is because the eutectic temperatures of na2so4 h2o and mgso4 h2o solution systems are 1 2 c and 4 8 c respectively ca and hco3 were greatly affected by soil freezing and thawing and the lowest proportion in the liquid phase were 5 6 and 4 2 indicating that when the soil froze to the deepest almost all of the two salt components were precipitated out of the soil solution and no longer migrated with the liquid water the average proportions of ca and hco3 in the liquid phase during the entire freeze and thaw period were 23 7 and 16 5 indicating the weak mobility the proportion of mg in solution was 33 6 to 68 7 with an average of 55 3 and the variation coefficient of 23 5 when the soil was freezing deeply the proportion of mg in soil solution decreased to be precipitated to sum up among the soil salt components cl na and so4 account for high proportion in the soil solution to the total content and are likely to migrate with the liquid soil water ca mg and hco3 are greatly affected by precipitation dissolution reaction of the soil solution with a relatively low proportion in soil solution during the freeze and thaw period 3 4 distribution of soil water and salt under the dynamic effect the distribution of liquid soil water and salt in solution under dynamic effect considering convection dispersion effect and convection effect only of soil salt are shown in fig 11 on december 06 2017 and november 29 2018 the liquid soil water in the upper soil showed a redistribution phenomenon taking december 06 2017 as an example the initial liquid soil water content of 0 0 4 m was low with an average of 0 19 cm3 cm3 and the liquid soil water content of 0 4 m 1 0 m was relatively high with an average of 0 43 cm3 cm3 under the influence of potential soil water gradient the liquid soil water content of 0 4 m 1 0 m migrated to the 0 0 4 m soil layer making the liquid soil water content of 0 0 4 m increase to 0 24 cm3 cm3 and that of 0 4 m 1 0 m decrease to 0 37 cm3 cm3 there was a great difference in liquid soil water content between the upper and lower parts of the frozen front forming a soil water potential gradient driving liquid water move from the lower part to the upper part under the dynamic effect making the distribution of liquid water in the profile more uniform compared with the distribution curve at chemical equilibrium the soil solution concentration of 0 0 4 m under convection effect moved upward as a whole with the upward migration of liquid soil water the solution in the lower part diluted the soil solution in 0 0 4 m resulting in a decrease in the salt concentration from 36 1 g l to 27 9 g l however the distribution of solution concentration on the soil profile was more uniform under the convection dispersion effect and the soil solution concentration of 0 0 4 m showed an obvious downward trend which decreased to 31 0 g l the lower value was formed because the solution concentration gradient between 0 0 4 m soil and the lower soil drove the salt to disperse to the lower soil on february 02 2018 and february 15 2019 compared with the distribution of soil water and salt at chemical equilibrium the content of liquid soil water and salt solution concentration remained unchanged at 0 0 8 m under dynamic effect because the liquid soil water content was low with an average value of 0 08 cm3 cm3 the low soil water content greatly reduced the soil hydraulic conductivity limiting the migration of liquid soil water as well as the soil salt on april 13 2018 and april 30 2019 the distribution of liquid soil water and salt concentration under chemical equilibrium and dynamic effect were basically coincided in which the soil dynamics condition was not greatly affected by the soil freezing it can be concluded that the soil water and salt transport are greatly affected by soil freeze and thaw process soil water potential gradient is formed between frozen and unfrozen soil at low temperature resulting in the obvious redistribution of liquid water under dynamic effect the convection effect makes the soil salt migrate along the direction of liquid soil water and the convection dispersion effect makes the soil salt distribution in the profile more uniform the distributions of soil salt ions in soil solution under dynamic effect considering convection dispersion effect and convection effect only are shown in fig 12 only the results at the beginning and end of the freeze periods were shown herein since the results at the end of the thaw period were very similar to those at the chemical equilibrium it can be found that the distribution of each soil salt ion under dynamic effect was different which was not completely consistent with the distribution of soil salt the distributions of na and cl under dynamic effect were highly similar to that of total salt solution concentration indicating that the migration of na and cl has a great impact on the migration of soil salt this is consistent with our previous study wang et al 2022 that there is a highly strong correlation between the increment of na and cl and the increment of soil salt in the frozen layer 0 1 m the difference between the distribution of soil so4 2 and soil salt concentration under the dynamic effect was mainly reflected at the end of the freeze period at this time the concentration of so4 2 at the frozen front reached to the peak at chemical equilibrium making so4 2 of the frozen front migrate to both two directions thus the decrease of so4 2 concentration in the frozen area under the dynamic effect was lower than those of na and cl the changes of ca2 and mg2 concentration were similar to the soil salt because of their low quantities the concentration difference between the frozen and unfrozen soil was relatively small making the reduction in the frozen area less than those of na cl and so4 2 the distribution of hco3 concentration was quite different from soil salt on november 29 2018 the concentration value of the entire profile was similar its distribution under the dynamic effect was similar to that under the chemical equilibrium it can be concluded that the distribution of each salt ion concentration in solution under the chemical equilibrium and dynamic effect is not completely consistent with soil salt concentration the migration direction of each ion is different due to their different distribution which eventually leads to the complexity of soil salt migration on the macro scale 3 5 potential migration quantity of soil water and salt in the frozen layer the distribution of potential migration quantity of liquid soil water is shown in fig 13 a d and the statistics of potential migration quantity of water in the frozen layer 0 1 m are shown in table 5 at the end of the freeze period as shown in fig 13b and fig 13d the surface soil was frozen deeply and the potential water migration quantity was close to 0 and the potential water migration quantity was positive only in the 0 2 m 0 3 m above the frozen front the soil water redistribution in the profile is mainly caused by phase change of liquid soil water to be ice in the negative temperature which results in large negative matrix potential value in the frozen soil layer then the great potential gradient between frozen and unfrozen soil layers is the major driving force for water redistribution soil water storage within the depth of 0 8 m 1 0 m which was within 0 2 m of soil above the freezing front increased more significantly than those in 0 0 8 m due to the effect of the larger soil water potential gradient between frozen and non frozen soil on december 06 2017 and november 29 2018 the soil water migration quantities in the frozen layer 0 1 m were 1 42 10 2 m3 m3 and 0 22 10 2 m3 m3 indicating the downward movement of the soil water from the frozen layer 0 1 m to the lower part this can be attributed to the high soil water content to recharge the groundwater which was consistent with the saturated state of the lower soil water under the dynamic effect in fig 11 on february 02 2018 and february 15 2019 the soil water migration quantities of the frozen layer 0 1 m were 2 05 10 2 m3 m3 and 2 67 10 2 m3 m3 indicating the upward movement of soil water from the unfrozen soil to the frozen soil this is because that the soil water potential gradient between the frozen area and the unfrozen area further increased with the freezing process resulting in intensified redistribution and increased potential migration of soil water in the frozen layer the distribution of potential convection and dispersion quantity of soil salt in each soil layer is shown in fig 13e h and fig 13i l respectively and the statistics of potential migration quantity of soil salt in the frozen layer 0 1 m are shown in table 5 the distribution of potential convection quantity of soil salt in the soil profile was similar to the potential migration quantity of liquid soil water the soil salt tended to increase in the soil layer where soil water accumulated under convection effect and decrease where soil water reduced for example on december 06 2017 liquid soil water moved from 0 4 m 1 0 m to soil layers with depth of 0 0 4 m and below 1 0 m causing a decrease in soil salt of 0 3 m 1 1 m and the salt accumulation at layers of 0 0 3 m and below 1 1 m for the potential dispersion quantity of soil salt the soil salt content in the frozen area decreased and salt accumulated in the unfrozen area for example on december 06 2017 the soil frozen depth was 0 36 m and fig 13i shows that the soil salt decreased at layers of 0 0 3 m while accumulated in the soil layers of 0 3 m 0 7 m which was the result of soil salt transport from the upper soil of the frozen front to the lower part under the dispersion effect the statistics of potential migration quantity of soil salt under the convection dispersion effect in the frozen layer 0 1 m are shown in table 5 the soil salt migration quantity in the frozen layer 0 1 m were 98 7 g m3 and 11 2 g m3 on december 06 2017 and november 29 2018 and 44 4 g m3 and 86 2 g m3 at the end of the two freeze periods indicating that the soil salt content in the frozen layer showed a decrease trend first and then increase during the freeze period the potential migration quantity of soil salt is the sum of potential convection quantity and potential dispersion quantity under the convection effect the soil salt migration quantity in the frozen layer 0 1 m on december 06 2017 and november 29 2018 were 100 7 g m3 and 12 2 g m3 respectively corresponding to the decrease of soil water storage in the frozen layer 0 1 m at this time the potential dispersion quantity of soil salt in the frozen layer 0 1 m were 2 1 g m3 and 1 0 g m3 the soil salt content in the frozen layer 0 1 m was basically unchanged under the dispersion effect due to the small frozen area at the beginning of the freeze period and the dispersion effect was weak to remove the soil salt in the frozen layer 0 1 m it can be concluded that the soil salt migration was dominated by the convection effect at the beginning of the freeze period under the convection effect the soil salt migration quantity in the frozen layer 0 1 m on february 02 2018 and february 15 2019 were 311 7 g m3 and 306 4 g m3 at this time the frozen area was wide with the deep frozen soil resulting in the soil salt concentration gradients of 89 0 g l m and 68 2 g l m between the frozen layer 0 1 m and the unfrozen layer 1 2 m the soil salt migrated to the unfrozen layer under the high salt concentration gradient with the potential dispersion quantity of soil salt in the frozen layer 0 1 m 267 2 g m3 and 220 2 g m3 at the end of the freeze period the convection effect caused the accumulation of soil salt in the frozen layer 0 1 m while the diffusion effect caused the soil salt content to decrease the relative strong convection effect causes the increase of the soil salt content in the frozen layer 0 1 m at the end of freeze period the phase change of soil water and soil salt results in small liquid soil water content and high salt concentration in the frozen layer causing a high concentration gradient between frozen and unfrozen soil which contributes greatly to soil salt transport in frozen soils chen et al 2018 conducted an experiment monitoring soil salt content in the frozen layer 0 1 m during the freeze and thaw period in the same research area and found that soil salt was only removed from 0 to 1 m soil in the early stage of the freeze period which was consistent with the results of this study yasin et al 2017 attributed the accumulation of soil salt during the freeze period to the continuous upward movement of soil water caused by the extremely low soil water potential of the overlying frozen soil and the movement of soil salt with soil water resulted in the accumulation of salt in the frozen soil although the soil water and salt calculated in this study tended to increase in the frozen layer which was consistent with the results of yasin et al 2017 decrease or increase of soil salt is actual determined by the combined influence of convection and dispersion and the soil salt dispersion effect cannot be ignored in certain conditions with stronger dispersion effect desalinization can occur in the frozen soil 3 6 salt ions contribution to the migration quantity of soil salt in the frozen layer the potential convection and dispersion quantity of soil salt ions in soil solution na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 are shown in fig 13e h and i l respectively and the potential migration quantity of soil salt ions in the frozen layer 0 1 m is shown in table 5 and statistics of the soil salt ion concentration gradient between the frozen layer 0 1 m and the unfrozen layer 1 2 m are shown in table 6 the potential migration quantities of na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 4 in the frozen layer 0 1 m on december 06 2017 were 28 1 g m3 2 5 g m3 1 9 g m3 9 1 g m3 21 3 g m3 and 35 8 g m3 and values on november 29 2018 were 3 1 g m3 0 1 g m3 0 4 g m3 1 4 g m3 2 3 g m3 and 4 0 g m3 indicating that most soil salt ions were likely to detach from the frozen layer 0 1 m at the beginning of the freeze period since the frozen depth on november 29 2018 was small about 0 18 m the redistribution of salt ions in the frozen layer 0 1 m was not obvious the potential migration quantities of na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 in the frozen layer 0 1 m on february 02 2018 were 8 2 g m3 3 0 g m3 2 3 g m3 9 2 g m3 10 9 g m3 and 10 9 g m3 and values on february 15 2019 were 19 7 g m3 3 6 g m3 2 8 g m3 14 7 g m3 10 3 g m3 and 35 1 g m3 indicating that soil salt ions accumulated in the frozen soil layer 0 1 m at the end of freeze period it can be concluded that the migration directions of all soil salt ions under the effect of convection and dispersion were relatively consistent but there are great differences in the migration quantities the contribution of different ions to the potential convection and potential dispersion quantities are shown in table 7 the mean values of potential convection quantity of hco3 mg2 and ca2 to that of soil salt were 5 7 1 8 and 1 4 and the mean values of potential dispersion quantity were 0 5 1 3 and 2 4 indicating that the migration quantity of soil salt under the effect of convection and dispersion was less affected by hco3 mg2 and ca2 the mean values of potential convection quantity of so4 2 na and cl to that of soil salt were 39 6 30 0 and 21 4 and the mean values of potential dispersion quantity were 41 3 32 2 and 22 3 indicating that the migration quantity of soil salt under the effect of convection and dispersion was greatly affected by so4 2 na and cl the higher contribution of so4 2 na and cl to the convection effect is due to the higher content of so4 na and cl in soil and so4 2 na and cl were not easy to precipitate from the soil solution with the content in liquid phase accounts for more than 74 5 of the total content of soil salt components owning the larger migration ability during the freeze and thaw period the great difference in the potential dispersion quantity of different kinds of salt ion were not only caused by the difference in the ion concentrations in solution but also by the difference in the concentration gradients between the frozen layer 0 1 m and the unfrozen layer 1 2 m the concentration gradient values were cl na so4 2 mg2 ca2 hco3 and those of cl na and so4 2 were much higher than mg2 ca2 and hco3 meanwhile the diffusion coefficients of cl na and so4 2 in free soil water are 1 209 cm2 d 0 783 cm2 d and 0 619 cm2 d higher than those of ca2 and mg2 with 0 466 cm2 d and 0 422 cm2 d the diffusion coefficient of hco3 in free soil water was 0 692 cm2 d which is between na and so4 2 however the small soluble concentration and low concentration gradient of hco3 caused the small dispersion quantity than cl na and so4 2 in total the potential migration quantities of na cl and so4 2 under the effect of convection and dispersion were higher than those of ca2 mg2 and hco3 this is consistent with the results that the ion increments of na cl and so4 2 were higher than those of ca2 and mg2 through field observation experiments of soil salt migration in frozen soil found by kang et al 1994 gray and granger 1986 also observed in situ experiment that salt accumulation in frozen soils was mainly composed of sodium and magnesium sulfates in conclusion the soil salt ions in the frozen layer 0 1 m showed a tendency to be released and accumulated at the beginning and end of the freeze period respectively due to the differences in ion solubility concentrations concentration gradients and diffusion coefficients the potential convection and dispersion quantities of na cl and so4 2 are higher than those of ca2 mg2 and hco3 moreover the convection and dispersion effect make soil salt ions migrate in different directions resulting in differences in salt migration directions and quantities 4 conclusions in this paper the potential migration quantities of soil water and salt as well as salt ions in the frozen soil were simulated on the basis of the distribution of soil water and salt ions in liquid and solid phases and the migration direction and capability of soil water and salt ions in freeze period were analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 the chemical reactions between soil salt ions are more complex after soil freezing due to the phase change caused by negative temperature among the soil salt components cl na and so4 are less affected by precipitation dissolution reaction because of their low eutectic points so they constitute the main components of liquid soil salt and therefore are more likely to migrate with the liquid soil water than ca mg and hco3 2 according to the potential migration quantity of liquid soil water and various salt ions in soil solution under dynamic effect the soil water salt and salt ions content in the frozen layer tend to decrease at the beginning of the freeze period and tend to accumulate at the end of the freeze period 3 the accumulation or reduction of soil salinity in the frozen layer depends on the direction and quantity of salt ions under convection and dispersion and the dispersion cannot be ignored 4 na cl and so4 2 constitute the main part of the potential migration quantity of soil salt due to their higher proportion in the liquid phase diffusion capacity and concentration gradient between frozen and unfrozen layers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
