and dry weather is common during the summer and early fall seasons weather data recorded by a watchdog 2700 weather station spectrum technologies inc aurora il deployed at the study site showed that the mean annual rainfall was 1220 6 mm from 2013 to 2015 with an average air temperature of 17 7 c according to the soil survey geographic database the watershed is covered primarily by forestdale 28

and rice production within the pbw a twr ditch at the study site fig 1 was monitored for water quality and rainfall from may 2012 to march 2016 the ditch has two trapezoidal channels that come together to form a y shaped feature both channels have 1 5 1 side slope 1 83 m maximum depth and 0 305 m freeboard the channel running from north to south is 430 m long with a total storage capacity of 8140 m3 whereas the channel running from northeast to southwest is 930 m in length with a total storage capacity of 16 920 m3 according to the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs office in indianola mississippi the land use of upstream fields draining into the ditch was primarily corn 697 1 ha and winter wheat 145 1 ha during the study period corn is planted in early spring march april while winter wheat is commonly planted during late fall october november these two crops are typically fertilized with soluble n at 150 kg ha 1 and 120 kg ha 1 respectively using a split application approach one third of the total fertilizer amount is applied near planting and the remaining is applied between 30 and 60 d after the first application 2 2 water quality and weather data acquisition an edge of field monitoring network was established at the study site in 2012 to collect water quality and weather data the network consisted of five water sampling points and one weather station defined as follows fig 1 1 first inlet p1 2 mid ditch p2 3 outlet p3 4 second inlet p4 5 pond pp and 6 weather station ws from may 2012 to march 2016 1 l water grab samples were collected at the sampling sites every three weeks during the growing season march to october and every six weeks during the dormant season samples were placed in a cooler at 4 c for transport from the field to the agricultural and biological engineering water quality laboratory at mississippi state university all water samples were analyzed within 24 h after collection for no3 n mg l 1 by the hach dimethylphenol method number 10206 using tnt plus a prepackaged vial chemistry technique hach loveland co and read by the hach dr 2800 portable spectrophotometer in this study no3 n results for samples collected at the p2 sampling point were used rainfall data were recorded automatically at 15 minute intervals by a watchdog 2700 weather station spectrum technologies inc aurora il deployed at the study site the monitoring program established in this investigation followed the quality assurance recommendations from the us environmental protection agency usepa 2002 2 3 data analysis to examine the influence of rainfall characteristics on in ditch no3 n concentration we investigated time series rainfall data and water quality data collected at the site in this study individual storm events were separated by a minimum of two hours without rainfall we hypothesize that this defined period will help advance the understanding of how consecutive rainfall events affect in ditch no3 n concentration also cumulative rainfall time series was used to identify rain events that occurred before each sampling event five features describing rainfall events before sampling and four characteristics of next to last rainfall events table 1 were established and used with no3 n concentration to conduct an analysis of linear dependence utilizing kendall s tau correlation coefficient p values equal to or smaller than 0 05 were considered statistically significant to identify how rainfall events were linked with levels of measured no3 n concentration a hierarchical clustering approach was conducted using results of the correlation analyses as input a clustering method partitions a data set based on similarities of data this method has been widely used in various scientific fields anderberg 2014 including hydrology and especially for rainfall classification analyses dos santos et al 2016 fang et al 2012 peng and wang 2012 wei et al 2007 in this study the k means clustering was applied to the dataset and trials were performed until the most suitable clusters appeared with aid of the calinski harabasz criterion calinski and harabasz 1974 significant differences between resulting clusters hereafter classes were tested using the wilcoxon rank sum test the shapiro wilk test was used to verify the assumption of normality of the dataset also when performing the k means clustering method the surrogate for water quality data that fell below the detection limit was one half the detection limit all data analyses were performed using matlab and the statistics and machine learning toolbox mathworks inc 2015a 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall and water quality time series temporal changes in rainfall and no3 n concentration measured in the ditch are shown in fig 2 during the study period may 2012 march 2016 the hourly rainfall recorded by the weather station was on average 0 15 mm and as high as 56 4 mm and the total measured rainfall was 4653 mm in general more rainfall was observed during the winter and spring seasons from december to may the mean of the 46 no3 n observations was 1 02 mg l 1 and ranged from 0 23 mg l 1 to 4 23 mg l 1 overall no3 n concentrations were higher during the planting february may and post harvest periods september november not surprisingly no3 n concentrations spiked during periods of abundant rainfall in the spring which also coincided with the planting and fertilization of corn and declined when rain virtually ceased for example the observed no3 n concentration rose from 0 294 mg l 1 on november 29 2012 to 3 43 mg l 1 on march 7 2013 which corresponds to more than a ten fold increase afterward the concentration declined to 1 9 mg l 1 on april 9 2013 and then increased again to 4 02 mg l 1 on may 6 2013 conversely during periods with very little rainfall e g 26 mm from june 25 2015 to october 23 2015 the no3 n concentration was consistently low approximately 0 23 mg l 1 however an exception to this pattern was found on december 5 2013 when a peak in no3 n concentration 3 9 mg l 1 was observed during a period without rain from october 16 2013 to december 13 2013 this unusual event might be due to rainfall occurring north of the system undetected by the weather station causing upstream nutrient loads to move through the downstream drainage network the magnitude of in ditch no3 n concentrations was consistently related to changes in the slope of the cumulative precipitation line as shown in fig 2 in addition to fall fertilizer applications in wheat the post harvest disking of corn stubble under dry conditions followed by late fall rainfall could have released residual soil no3 causing higher no3 n concentrations in the ditch during the september november timeframe hess et al 2020 recent studies have shown similar patterns of increased n in streams when climate transitions from drought to wet conditions loecke et al 2017 van metre et al 2016 while there may be multiple factors affecting observed no3 n concentrations in the ditch neilen et al 2017 the findings produced in this study indicate that the local rainfall characteristics at the study site had a strong influence on no3 n concentrations measured in the ditch 3 2 classification of rainfall events based on their influence on no3 n concentrations using the rainfall data collected from may 2012 to march 2016 46 out of 620 rainfall events were identified as being linked to the measured no3 n concentration of the samples collected from the ditch these events were the input records of the linear dependence analysis using kendall s tau correlation coefficient the resulting correlation matrix of the nine rainfall characteristics related to depth intensity and duration and no3 n concentrations is shown in table 2 the in ditch no3 n concentration was significantly correlated to six out of nine rainfall features of the six significantly correlated rainfall features two corresponded to the rainfall event before water quality sampling i e rduep and tbrs and the remaining four were associated with the next to last rainfall event i e dnre inre dunre tbnre the rduep showed a direct association with the no3 n concentration r 0 248 p value 0 028 indicating that the duration of rainfall events before sampling might play a more important role on the in ditch no3 n concentration rather than the magnitude of these rain events further this finding is supported by failing to reject the null hypothesis of zero correlation coefficient between no3 n concentration and rdep r 0 164 p value 0 126 and riep r 0 022 p value 0 847 the inverse association found between no3 n and tbrs r 0 289 p value 0 006 was also expected the negative correlation means that the more time that elapsed between a rainfall event and the subsequent water quality sampling event the lower the no3 n concentration measured in the ditch this finding highlights the fact that residence time is a critical factor in controlling nutrient reduction through the twr ditch although this variable was not directly measured in the present study on the other hand we found that no3 n concentration positively correlated with depth dnre r 0 287 p value 0 007 intensity inre r 0 234 p value 0 029 and duration dunre r 0 320 p value 0 004 of next to last rainfall events these results indicate that depth intensity and duration of successive rainfall events might have greatly influenced the observed no3 n level in the ditch also this influence was supported by the negative correlation found between no3 n and tbnre r 0 281 p value 0 009 meaning that higher no3 n concentrations were found as the dry time before the next to last rainfall event was shorter therefore these findings suggest no3 n concentrations observed in the ditch were strongly dependent on antecedent hydrological conditions within the study area with the duration of rainfall events before sampling and the characteristics of next to last rainfall events playing a more influential role the 46 rainfall events linked to measured no3 n concentrations were grouped into four classes using the k means clustering method table 3 where the six rainfall characteristics that significantly correlated with no3 n concentrations were used as input the different classes are described as class i moderately frequent moderate rainfall frequency 14 depth 108 7 mm class ii less frequent very high rainfall frequency 3 depth 211 8 mm class iii highly frequent moderate rainfall frequency 28 depth 110 9 mm and class iv infrequent low rainfall frequency 1 depth 42 7 mm regarding precipitation frequency we found classes ranked as follows from highest to lowest iii i ii iv for total rainfall depth class ii had the highest amount followed by classes iii i and iv combined variables of total rainfall depth and frequency showed that classes i and iii were likely to have the most impact on the in ditch water quality congreves et al 2016 reported similar results where higher no3 n losses were associated with greater total precipitation and more frequent and intense precipitation events this impact can be further analyzed by showing the inter month distribution of the different classes during the monitoring period as displayed in fig 3 class i rainfall events mostly occurred during the spring especially during the pre growing season whereas class iii events were more prevalent during the growing season and fall class i rainfall events were associated with higher no3 n concentrations that had a median concentration median 1 78 mg l 1 w 455 p value 4 35 10 6 more than five orders of magnitude greater than the no3 n concentrations linked with class iii events median 0 33 mg l 1 these two classes did not show significant differences in rdep w 352 p value 0 174 riep w 313 p value 0 752 rduep w 360 5 p value 0 095 tbrs w 257 p value 0 246 or tbtr w 264 5 p value 0 337 instead the classes did significantly differ in the characteristics describing next to last rainfall events when compared with class iii events class i events were significantly higher in depth dnre w 477 5 p value 4 12 10 8 intensity inre w 443 p value 2 81 10 5 and duration dunre w 463 p value 7 07 10 7 of next to last rainfall events class i events also had shorter tbnre w 220 p value 0 014 these results generally suggest that the effect of class i rainfall events on in ditch no3 n concentrations appears to be magnified under higher depth intensity duration and shorter dry time before next to last rainfall events results show that no3 n levels in the twr ditch were highly sensitive to successive rainfall events occurring during the spring and fall seasons and seemed to be interacting with the timing of fertilizer application these findings are significant because they reflect the combined effect of spring and fall fertilizer applications and substantial amounts of rain falling over fertilized and exposed soils classified as poorly drained and in a high potential runoff class according to our dataset 60 of the total annual rainfall occurred during the spring 35 from february to may and fall 25 from september to november seasons when fertilizer was usually applied nitrogen application during fall is in the form of ammonia nh3 which is likely converted into no3 via nitrification through the winter and spring seasons the final product of this oxidation process is no3 which is more water soluble and readilymobile than nh3 kyveryga et al 2004 sahrawat 1989 2008 subbarao et al 2006 consequently a large portion of the n applied during the fall might have been washed off the field and into the twr ditch in spring by class i rainfall events also this condition may have been exacerbated by supplemental n applied during the spring typically in the form of no3 to replenish what was lost from the fall application consecutive antecedent rainfall might bring the soils to field capacity relatively fast such that rain events before sampling may not need high magnitudes to trigger increased levels of no3 n in the ditch instead effects of class i rainfall events were magnified by antecedent rainfall conditions lower levels of no3 n were observed in the ditch during late summer and fall and were associated with class iii rainfall events our study showed the influence of class iii rainfall events on in ditch water quality was driven mainly by high frequency and low magnitude events and dry antecedent conditions during the summer the study area is planted with row crops actively utilizing soil no3 n which might account for decreased no3 n concentrations lost through overland flow and soil erosion and result in lower levels of in ditch no3 n there are also higher evapotranspiration rates during this summer period up to 200 mm data not shown likely increasing the soil storage capacity such that less runoff may occur randall and mulla 2001 in addition irrigation events occurring during the late summer might have influenced water quality in the ditch although this effect is not investigated in this study rainfall events classified as ii and iv were not as frequent and therefore these were not tested for significant differences between or among classes only three class ii events were linked to a median no3 n concentration of 0 74 mg l 1 and accounted for 211 8 mm of rainfall which was the highest total rainfall depth among classes rainfall events classified as ii represented storms with high depth rdep high intensity riep and moderate duration rduep one event with 42 7 mm of rainfall was grouped as class iv and linked to a measured concentration of 4 23 mg l 1 of no3 n in the ditch the single class iv rainfall event was characterized by high depth rdep low intensity riep and long duration rduep both class ii and iv were consistently associated with low magnitudes of rainfall characteristics i e dnre inre and dunre for next to last events which show their associated effects might have been independent of antecedent hydrological conditions class ii and iv rainfall events should be further analyzed as high amounts of no3 n could be transported during the dormant season due to longer duration of these two classes of events with no apparent dependence on next to last rainfall events fig 4 however the impact of the class ii and iv rainfall events on the no3 n concentrations in the ditch should not be discounted due to the limited number of water samples collected the impact of the class ii and iv rainfall events on twr and structural bmps is an open topic that requires more investigation 4 summary and conclusions understanding the effects of rainfall characteristics on the no3 n concentration in twr ditches over time is important for improving their ability to control excess nutrients transferred from agroecosystems into surface waters most studies that have addressed this research have been performed either under limited and controlled conditions plot based or with simulated rainfall without identifying the relative effect of rainfall features on the performance of the twr ditch this study examined how rainfall depth intensity and duration affect the no3 n concentration in a twr ditch implemented at a farm within the porter bayou watershed in mississippi usa the time series analysis of rainfall and no3 n concentration which included time series data for cumulative precipitation was essential to link the observed levels of in ditch no3 n with rainfall characteristics also analysis showed that the potential interaction between fertilizer application timing and successive rainfall events is a determining factor on the in ditch nutrient level the linear dependence analysis provided insight into the implications of antecedent hydrological conditions on the nutrient reduction performance of the ditch rainfall classes identified by using the k means clustering approach show that class i events had a greater effect on no3 n levels and provide information on rainfall characteristics that should be considered for future design operation and management of twr ditches to achieve more efficient nutrient control strategies methodology used in the present study can be of practical relevance if additional research is done at different spatial scales and for various individual or combined bmps and pollutants results of this investigation suggest that these systems be managed to increase residence time especially during the spring months for example in systems that include a storage pond the twr ditch should be pumped into the pond and the pond kept at full capacity at all times so the twr can receive and hold as much runoff as possible during periods with frequent sequential rainfall events designing systems with automatic controls would make this easier in addition using twr ditches in combination with storage ponds and other conservation practices such as vegetated filter strips or cover crops would increase absorption and slow runoff more so than a bare field draining directly to a twr ditch particularly during the spring months can help reduce downstream nutrient loss in

office in indianola mississippi the land use of upstream fields draining into the ditch was primarily corn 697 1 ha and winter wheat 145 1 ha during the study period corn is planted in early spring march april while winter wheat is commonly planted during late fall october november these two crops are typically fertilized with soluble n at 150 kg ha 1 and 120 kg ha 1 respectively using a split application approach one third of the total fertilizer amount is applied near planting and the remaining is applied between 30 and 60 d after the first application 2 2 water quality and weather data acquisition an edge of field monitoring network was established at the study site in 2012 to collect water quality and weather data the network consisted of five water sampling points and one weather station defined as follows fig 1 1 first inlet p1 2 mid ditch p2 3 outlet p3 4 second inlet p4 5 pond pp and 6 weather station ws from may 2012 to march 2016 1 l water grab samples were collected at the sampling sites every three weeks during the growing season march to october and every six weeks during the dormant season samples were placed in a cooler at 4 c for transport from the field to the agricultural and biological engineering water quality laboratory at mississippi state university all water samples were analyzed within 24 h after collection for no3 n mg l 1 by the hach dimethylphenol method number 10206 using tnt plus a prepackaged vial chemistry technique hach loveland co and read by the hach dr 2800 portable spectrophotometer in this study no3 n results for samples collected at the p2 sampling point were used rainfall data were recorded automatically at 15 minute intervals by a watchdog 2700 weather station spectrum technologies inc aurora il deployed at the study site the monitoring program established in this investigation followed the quality assurance recommendations from the us environmental protection agency usepa 2002 2 3 data analysis to examine the influence of rainfall characteristics on in ditch no3 n concentration we investigated time series rainfall data and water quality data collected at the site in this study individual storm events were separated by a minimum of two hours without rainfall we hypothesize that this defined period will help advance the understanding of how consecutive rainfall events affect in ditch no3 n concentration also cumulative rainfall time series was used to identify rain events that occurred before each sampling event five features describing rainfall events before sampling and four characteristics of next to last rainfall events table 1 were established and used with no3 n concentration to conduct an analysis of linear dependence utilizing kendall s tau correlation coefficient p values equal to or smaller than 0 05 were considered statistically significant to identify how rainfall events were linked with levels of measured no3 n concentration a hierarchical clustering approach was conducted using results of the correlation analyses as input a clustering method partitions a data set based on similarities of data this method has been widely used in various scientific fields anderberg 2014 including hydrology and especially for rainfall classification analyses dos santos et al 2016 fang et al 2012 peng and wang 2012 wei et al 2007 in this study the k means clustering was applied to the dataset and trials were performed until the most suitable clusters appeared with aid of the calinski harabasz criterion calinski and harabasz 1974 significant differences between resulting clusters hereafter classes were tested using the wilcoxon rank sum test the shapiro wilk test was used to verify the assumption of normality of the dataset also when performing the k means clustering method the surrogate for water quality data that fell below the detection limit was one half the detection limit all data analyses were performed using matlab and the statistics and machine learning toolbox mathworks inc 2015a 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall and water quality time series temporal changes in rainfall and no3 n concentration measured in the ditch are shown in fig 2 during the study period may 2012 march 2016 the hourly rainfall recorded by the weather station was on average 0 15 mm and as high as 56 4 mm and the total measured rainfall was 4653 mm in general more rainfall was observed during the winter and spring seasons from december to may the mean of the 46 no3 n observations was 1 02 mg l 1 and ranged from 0 23 mg l 1 to 4 23 mg l 1 overall no3 n concentrations were higher during the planting february may and post harvest periods september november not surprisingly no3 n concentrations spiked during periods of abundant rainfall in the spring which also coincided with the planting and fertilization of corn and declined when rain virtually ceased for example the observed no3 n concentration rose from 0 294 mg l 1 on november 29 2012 to 3 43 mg l 1 on march 7 2013 which corresponds to more than a ten fold increase afterward the concentration declined to 1 9 mg l 1 on april 9 2013 and then increased again to 4 02 mg l 1 on may 6 2013 conversely during periods with very little rainfall e g 26 mm from june 25 2015 to october 23 2015 the no3 n concentration was consistently low approximately 0 23 mg l 1 however an exception to this pattern was found on december 5 2013 when a peak in no3 n concentration 3 9 mg l 1 was observed during a period without rain from october 16 2013 to december 13 2013 this unusual event might be due to rainfall occurring north of the system undetected by the weather station causing upstream nutrient loads to move through the downstream drainage network the magnitude of in ditch no3 n concentrations was consistently related to changes in the slope of the cumulative precipitation line as shown in fig 2 in addition to fall fertilizer applications in wheat the post harvest disking of corn stubble under dry conditions followed by late fall rainfall could have released residual soil no3 causing higher no3 n concentrations in the ditch during the september november timeframe hess et al 2020 recent studies have shown similar patterns of increased n in streams when climate transitions from drought to wet conditions loecke et al 2017 van metre et al 2016 while there may be multiple factors affecting observed no3 n concentrations in the ditch neilen et al 2017 the findings produced in this study indicate that the local rainfall characteristics at the study site had a strong influence on no3 n concentrations measured in the ditch 3 2 classification of rainfall events based on their influence on no3 n concentrations using the rainfall data collected from may 2012 to march 2016 46 out of 620 rainfall events were identified as being linked to the measured no3 n concentration of the samples collected from the ditch these events were the input records of the linear dependence analysis using kendall s tau correlation coefficient the resulting correlation matrix of the nine rainfall characteristics related to depth intensity and duration and no3 n concentrations is shown in table 2 the in ditch no3 n concentration was significantly correlated to six out of nine rainfall features of the six significantly correlated rainfall features two corresponded to the rainfall event before water quality sampling i e rduep and tbrs and the remaining four were associated with the next to last rainfall event i e dnre inre dunre tbnre the rduep showed a direct association with the no3 n concentration r 0 248 p value 0 028 indicating that the duration of rainfall events before sampling might play a more important role on the in ditch no3 n concentration rather than the magnitude of these rain events further this finding is supported by failing to reject the null hypothesis of zero correlation coefficient between no3 n concentration and rdep r 0 164 p value 0 126 and riep r 0 022 p value 0 847 the inverse association found between no3 n and tbrs r 0 289 p value 0 006 was also expected the negative correlation means that the more time that elapsed between a rainfall event and the subsequent water quality sampling event the lower the no3 n concentration measured in the ditch this finding highlights the fact that residence time is a critical factor in controlling nutrient reduction through the twr ditch although this variable was not directly measured in the present study on the other hand we found that no3 n concentration positively correlated with depth dnre r 0 287 p value 0 007 intensity inre r 0 234 p value 0 029 and duration dunre r 0 320 p value 0 004 of next to last rainfall events these results indicate that depth intensity and duration of successive rainfall events might have greatly influenced the observed no3 n level in the ditch also this influence was supported by the negative correlation found between no3 n and tbnre r 0 281 p value 0 009 meaning that higher no3 n concentrations were found as the dry time before the next to last rainfall event was shorter therefore these findings suggest no3 n concentrations observed in the ditch were strongly dependent on antecedent hydrological conditions within the study area with the duration of rainfall events before sampling and the characteristics of next to last rainfall events playing a more influential role the 46 rainfall events linked to measured no3 n concentrations were grouped into four classes using the k means clustering method table 3 where the six rainfall characteristics that significantly correlated with no3 n concentrations were used as input the different classes are described as class i moderately frequent moderate rainfall frequency 14 depth 108 7 mm class ii less frequent very high rainfall frequency 3 depth 211 8 mm class iii highly frequent moderate rainfall frequency 28 depth 110 9 mm and class iv infrequent low rainfall frequency 1 depth 42 7 mm regarding precipitation frequency we found classes ranked as follows from highest to lowest iii i ii iv for total rainfall depth class ii had the highest amount followed by classes iii i and iv combined variables of total rainfall depth and frequency showed that classes i and iii were likely to have the most impact on the in ditch water quality congreves et al 2016 reported similar results where higher no3 n losses were associated with greater total precipitation and more frequent and intense precipitation events this impact can be further analyzed by showing the inter month distribution of the different classes during the monitoring period as displayed in fig 3 class i rainfall events mostly occurred during the spring especially during the pre growing season whereas class iii events were more prevalent during the growing season and fall class i rainfall events were associated with higher no3 n concentrations that had a median concentration median 1 78 mg l 1 w 455 p value 4 35 10 6 more than five orders of magnitude greater than the no3 n concentrations linked with class iii events median 0 33 mg l 1 these two classes did not show significant differences in rdep w 352 p value 0 174 riep w 313 p value 0 752 rduep w 360 5 p value 0 095 tbrs w 257 p value 0 246 or tbtr w 264 5 p value 0 337 instead the classes did significantly differ in the characteristics describing next to last rainfall events when compared with class iii events class i events were significantly higher in depth dnre w 477 5 p value 4 12 10 8 intensity inre w 443 p value 2 81 10 5 and duration dunre w 463 p value 7 07 10 7 of next to last rainfall events class i events also had shorter tbnre w 220 p value 0 014 these results generally suggest that the effect of class i rainfall events on in ditch no3 n concentrations appears to be magnified under higher depth intensity duration and shorter dry time before next to last rainfall events results show that no3 n levels in the twr ditch were highly sensitive to successive rainfall events occurring during the spring and fall seasons and seemed to be interacting with the timing of fertilizer application these findings are significant because they reflect the combined effect of spring and fall fertilizer applications and substantial amounts of rain falling over fertilized and exposed soils classified as poorly drained and in a high potential runoff class according to our dataset 60 of the total annual rainfall occurred during the spring 35 from february to may and fall 25 from september to november seasons when fertilizer was usually applied nitrogen application during fall is in the form of ammonia nh3 which is likely converted into no3 via nitrification through the winter and spring seasons the final product of this oxidation process is no3 which is more water soluble and readilymobile than nh3 kyveryga et al 2004 sahrawat 1989 2008 subbarao et al 2006 consequently a large portion of the n applied during the fall might have been washed off the field and into the twr ditch in spring by class i rainfall events also this condition may have been exacerbated by supplemental n applied during the spring typically in the form of no3 to replenish what was lost from the fall application consecutive antecedent rainfall might bring the soils to field capacity relatively fast such that rain events before sampling may not need high magnitudes to trigger increased levels of no3 n in the ditch instead effects of class i rainfall events were magnified by antecedent rainfall conditions lower levels of no3 n were observed in the ditch during late summer and fall and were associated with class iii rainfall events our study showed the influence of class iii rainfall events on in ditch water quality was driven mainly by high frequency and low magnitude events and dry antecedent conditions during the summer the study area is planted with row crops actively utilizing soil no3 n which might account for decreased no3 n concentrations lost through overland flow and soil erosion and result in lower levels of in ditch no3 n there are also higher evapotranspiration rates during this summer period up to 200 mm data not shown likely increasing the soil storage capacity such that less runoff may occur randall and mulla 2001 in addition irrigation events occurring during the late summer might have influenced water quality in the ditch although this effect is not investigated in this study rainfall events classified as ii and iv were not as frequent and therefore these were not tested for significant differences between or among classes only three class ii events were linked to a median no3 n concentration of 0 74 mg l 1 and accounted for 211 8 mm of rainfall which was the highest total rainfall depth among classes rainfall events classified as ii represented storms with high depth rdep high intensity riep and moderate duration rduep one event with 42 7 mm of rainfall was grouped as class iv and linked to a measured concentration of 4 23 mg l 1 of no3 n in the ditch the single class iv rainfall event was characterized by high depth rdep low intensity riep and long duration rduep both class ii and iv were consistently associated with low magnitudes of rainfall characteristics i e dnre inre and dunre for next to last events which show their associated effects might have been independent of antecedent hydrological conditions class ii and iv rainfall events should be further analyzed as high amounts of no3 n could be transported during the dormant season due to longer duration of these two classes of events with no apparent dependence on next to last rainfall events fig 4 however the impact of the class ii and iv rainfall events on the no3 n concentrations in the ditch should not be discounted due to the limited number of water samples collected the impact of the class ii and iv rainfall events on twr and structural bmps is an open topic that requires more investigation 4 summary and conclusions understanding the effects of rainfall characteristics on the no3 n concentration in twr ditches over time is important for improving their ability to control excess nutrients transferred from agroecosystems into surface waters most studies that have addressed this research have been performed either under limited and controlled conditions plot based or with simulated rainfall without identifying the relative effect of rainfall features on the performance of the twr ditch this study examined how rainfall depth intensity and duration affect the no3 n concentration in a twr ditch implemented at a farm within the porter bayou watershed in mississippi usa the time series analysis of rainfall and no3 n concentration which included time series data for cumulative precipitation was essential to link the observed levels of in ditch no3 n with rainfall characteristics also analysis showed that the potential interaction between fertilizer application timing and successive rainfall events is a determining factor on the in ditch nutrient level the linear dependence analysis provided insight into the implications of antecedent hydrological conditions on the nutrient reduction performance of the ditch rainfall classes identified by using the k means clustering approach show that class i events had a greater effect on no3 n levels and provide information on rainfall characteristics that should be considered for future design operation and management of twr ditches to achieve more efficient nutrient control strategies methodology used in the present study can be of practical relevance if additional research is done at different spatial scales and for various individual or combined bmps and pollutants results of this investigation suggest that these systems be managed to increase residence time especially during the spring months for example in systems that include a storage pond the twr ditch should be pumped into the pond and the pond kept at full capacity at all times so the twr can receive and hold as much runoff as possible during periods with frequent sequential rainfall events designing systems with automatic controls would make this easier in addition using twr ditches in combination with storage ponds and other conservation practices such as vegetated filter strips or cover crops would increase absorption and slow runoff more so than a bare field draining directly to a twr ditch particularly during the spring months can help reduce downstream nutrient loss in

10656,the increasing demands of the population and the need for development obliged the optimal use and adaptive management of the watershed resources accordingly it is necessary to adopt comprehensive measures to reach sustainable development goals this objective can be achieved by the application of interdisciplinary and professional approaches through establishing dynamic and optimal balance in supply and demand resources however such important optimization approaches have been rarely practiced at the watershed scale the present study has been therefore formulated to apply a linear water energy food nexus optimization for the shazand watershed markazi province iran this approach was applied for planning 14 crops planted in orchard irrigated farms and rain fed farms between 2006 and 2014 and targeting water energy food nexus index wefni maximization the connections among the water energy and food were then evaluated through determining the amount of consumption mass productivity and economic productivity of water and energy the results of wefnis revealed that almond has the highest wefni with values of 0 92 0 76 0 76 0 83 0 86 0 86 0 87 0 87 and 0 88 whilst potato with wefni of 0 05 0 05 0 05 0 06 0 09 0 10 and 0 11 sugar cane with wefni of 0 10 and cucumber with wefni of 0 13 had the lowest scores and the corresponding lowest performance among the study crops the outcomes of optimization study explained that the current situation of land use in the shazand watershed is unsuitable to minimize water and energy consumption and maximize benefit the results can be used as an effective tool for designating proper soil and water resource management strategies in the region keywords adaptive management land use optimization livelihood security system dynamic wef nexus 1 introduction nowadays resources management in the watersheds is a vital task for the managers and planners due to the necessity of handling challenging issues existed between supply and demand sectors accordingly many researchers emphasized that water food and energy already experiencing significant stress and shortfall in the world and the demand for these resources will increase significantly over the next decades bizikova et al 2013 endo et al 2015 el gafy et al 2017a el gafy 2017 in iran according to a report from the center for strategic studies

growth societal demands urbanization economic development cultural technological changes changing life styles and climate change on water food and energy resources need to create an adaptive management approach in response to these drivers el gafy et al 2017b karan et al 2018 the purpose of the adaptation is to reduce vulnerability to climate and human changes so understanding of the complex interlinkages in the water energy food wef security nexus approach has become critically important to sustainable development and secure future for all nations and regions mohtar and daher 2012 gulati et al 2013 rasul and sharma 2016 cai et al 2018 stephan et al 2018 terrapon pfaff et al 2018 the united nations has recommended 17 sustainable development goals sdgs applicable by all countries in the world on the other hands protecting and enhancing the ability of the earth s soils to provide clean water and safe food for the humanity in agriculture will be a key element in delivering sdgs keesstra et al 2016 2018 so the present research is based on the sdgs three of which are applied to food security and sustainable management of water sdgs 2 3 and 6 in this vein new sustainable and integrated approaches like land degradation neutrality ldn and wef nexus keesstra et al 2018 kiani harchegani and sadeghi 2020 would help managers and decision makers stop increasing pressure on land resources the wef nexus approach was first conceived at the bonn 2011 nexus conference held in preparation for the united nations un rio 20 conference gulati et al 2013 biggs et al 2015 the concept of nexus among food water and energy and application of the wef nexus have been reported during last decade in different resources management and the regions in the world smajgl et al 2016 smidt et al 2016 tidwell 2016 zhang and vesselinov 2017 kantor et al 2017 holger et al 2017 hussien et al 2017 franz et al 2018 moioli et al 2018 martinez et al 2018 white et al 2018 wicaksono and kang 2019 daher et al 2019 li et al 2019 sharifi moghadam et al 2019 in fact handling more than one complex and interconnected chapters are considered in the nexus approach to achieve better results hettiarachchi and ardakanian 2016 the tools and integrated approaches for water energy food security analyses are provided through the nexus management the results of such examinations will be used by decision makers and stakeholders in practical decision scenarios the wef nexus management analyses should be capable to implement optimal approaches for managing water energy and food policies and management approaches within a sector affecting the other sectors zhang and vesselinov 2017 agriculture is the main user of the world water resources and it is essential for food production consequently the sustainability of agriculture would require the efficient management of the available finite water resources under the existing limitations garg and dadhich 2014 in the same vein to assess water sustainability a set of comparative performance indices e g water availability water scarcity water resources vulnerability social water stress water stress and the water poverty are needed which cannot be achieved without considering the water energy food nexus molle and mollinga 2003 brown and matlock 2011 juwana et al 2012 el gafy 2017 nevertheless the water energy food nexus is a necessity to create an index that not focus only on one sector such as the former indices but also examines the water and energy and to achieve the optimal cropping pattern el gafy 2017 because of the intercommunications between three sectors water energy and food security nexus any single sector approach may lead to serious unpremeditated issues bizikova et al 2013 the water energy food nexus index can be accordingly utilized as a tool to evaluate and analyze strategies that combine several aspects to reflect main concerns in the water energy food nexus with one number el gafy et al 2017c reviewing of existing and accessible literatures shows that a nexus oriented approach is required to tackle the current levels of insecurity in access to resources in the recent years focus is changing to approaches discussed upon the optimization of the nexus karnib 2017 lópez díaz et al 2017 dhaubanjar et al 2017 el gafy et al 2017a stamou and rutschmann 2018 gonzález bravo et al 2018 kan et al 2018 uen et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 nie et al 2019 esmaeli and roshandel 2020 concluding the existing literatures shows that there have been some approaches for the water energy food nexus optimization in different applications however to the best of our knowledge the study of the water energy food nexus index wefni in the field of agriculture at the watershed scale is poor in this regards the present research presents the first water energy food nexus index wefni study for iran agronomic crops and has been ultimately formulated to analyze the water energy food nexus index of 14 food crops under different subcultures irrigated and rain fed for the shazand watershed for the time period 2006 2014 next non nexus and nexus approaches were examined under two scenarios scenario1 shows the existing cropping pattern and scenario 2 describes the nexus approach by maximizing the water energy food nexus index wefni the proposed approach would therefore assist local managers to make appropriate decision based on the consumption efficiency of water food and energy as a whole it has been accordingly hypothesized that the existing managerial pattern of the agricultural land use of the study area is not optimal in the viewpoint of the wef nexus approach expediting the application of the wef nexus index with the developed optimization model would hopefully provide a powerful tool for the local decision makers to properly manage limited resources at the watershed scale 2 case study the shazand mountains watershed with an area of about 1740 km2 placed in the southwestern markazi province of iran is a sub watershed of the qareh chai watershed it is extended between 49 04 15 to 49 52 12 e and 33 44 42 to 34 12 13 n as shown in fig 1 the shazand watershed with elevation ranges from 1800 m to more than 3300 m above mean sea level the annual rainfall is also varied from 340 mm to more than 780 mm per annum with an average of some 420 mm with a moderate semi arid to cold semi arid climate it is some 40 km from southwest of arak city capital of markazi province it consisted of five towns and 107 villages and 10 counties rural district over the past decades the shazand plain has been a fertile region due to the potential for agricultural development along with industrial activities particularly and most of the inhabitants were supported by farming davudirad et al 2016 hazbavi and sadeghi 2017 sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 2 1 cropping pattern the study was conducted for 14 main food crops for the shazand watershed under irrigation i e wheat bean sugar cane potatoes onion watermelon cucumber alfalfa almond and walnut and rain fed i e wheat barley chickpea and safflower conditions for the data reported from 2006 to 2014 seven major representative categories of crops including cereals beans industrial crops vegetables cucurbits forage and orchard were considered in the shazand watershed the data were collected from the shazand province organization of jihad e jihad e agriculture shazand province organization of jihad e agriculture 2014 some other information was further accumulated from farmers through face to face interview the dominant crops and corresponding temporal variations in the region have been summarized in tables 1 and 2 3 methodology the present study was designed to evaluate the water energy food nexus of 14 different crops for the shazand watershed from 2006 to 2014 meanwhile the problem was then programmed using linear optimization to the nexus approach applying an objective function to maximize a water energy food nexus index with the help of gams software package the entire study has was formulated in five steps as planned to perform the main research purposes the details of methodology have been given in fig 2 3 1 water energy food wef nexus framework building the wef nexus framework combines three interconnected components of water food energy food and energy water as shown in fig 3 indicators are conceptual tools for sustainability evaluations that can be influential in many sectors so for the present research the interrelation between water and food was measured by water consumption water mass productivity and water economic productivity indicators in addition energy consumption energy mass productivity and energy economic productivity indicators are indicative the relationship between energy and food the connection between energy and water was therefore addressed through energy consumption due to increasing economic activity with the passage of time on the shazand watershed that might increase demand for energy by reducing the groundwater tables due to the growing pressure on groundwater resources the energy cost of lifting deeper groundwater should usually increases nabavi 2018 moreover feedback theory is established between financial development and energy consumption that attract the notice of policymakers in developing countries to develop a plan to decrease the consequences of energy consumption by managing resource saud et al 2018 the weights were also defined alike due to the limited information in the study area 3 1 1 water and energy consumption indicators the water green or rainwater and blue or irrigation water consumption indicator 1 per hectare of crop c at time t wc t m3 ha 1 in the shazand watershed was collected based on the data collected from the regional water company of markazi and the markazi province water and wastewater company iran water resources management 2015 in addition the netwat crop water calculator alizadeh et al 2008 and iran s national water resources development plan were used to obtain a dataset of average water demands for different crops in the shazand watershed netwat was improved based on iran s national water resources development plan which provides estimates of water demands for a variety of crops produced in different provinces mirzaei et al 2019 energy consumption indicator 2

water and energy mass productivity indicators water and energy mass productivity was used as the indicators for food valuation since the crops foods differ greatly in viewpoint of calorific and or nutritive values so that the yields of the different crops were calculated in calories per unit area of land under cultivation ha in the same vein the water and energy mass productivity were calculated in calories per cubic meters of water cal m 3 and calories per mega joule of energy cal mj 1 with the help of eq 5 el gafy 2017 5 w p t y c t w c t where yc t is the yield of crop c cal ha

component and n the number of wefni variables the highest and the lowest values of one and zero were respectively assigned to the highest and lowest wefni for each crop since the actual values of indicators of wefni are presented in different units and magnitudes they cannot be aggregated or compared hence indicators of wefni were normalized via continuous rescaling method to produce an identical range for the values of indicators between zero and one using eq 10 given in the following general formula juwana et al 2012 10 s i x i x m i n x m a x x m i n where si is the sub index

actually the management objective of the wefni model was supposed to maximize economic water and energy and minimize water and energy use el gafy et al 2017c the general water energy food nexus index and its maximization objective function were accordingly formulated as below el gafy et al 2017a 12 w e f n i i e c e p e e v w c w p w e v 6 13 m a x z i 1 n w e f n i i a i where ec energy

for the total volume of green the amount of rain received by the watershed and blue running water in drainage system water consumed and statistical indicators of water consumption in the agricultural shazand watershed for various crops during 2006 and 2014 are shown in table 4 and fig 4 water is a necessary input in farming and a vital resource for economic and social development hristov 2014 mirzaei et al 2019 confirmed that access to extremely subsidized water surface water and groundwater and energy has been the determination of agricultural development strategies in iran which utilizes more than 90 of total water withdrawals and provides about 10 of the gdp therefore water consumption for agronomic crop production has very overshot the renewable water supply capacity of the country making water bankruptcy a serious national security threat increasing water stress will raise the risk of water conflicts driven by water management problems madani 2010 in addition high soil and water losses reduce soil quality and finally this can decrease the quality of crops rodrigo comino et al 2018 so it is necessary to perform holistic policy improvements aimed at decreasing agricultural water consumption to alleviate the looming water bankruptcy threats consequently water consumption as a sub indicator of the water food indicator is important there are high variations of the highest and lowest water consumption in various crops over the study years however from 2009 to 2013 the highest and lowest water consumption was related to sugar cane and bean crops the energy of seeds chemical fertilizers pesticide machinery human labor diesel electricity and water for irrigation inputs per ha in the crop production system are examined in the estimation of energy consumption it is implied from fig 4 that potato and onion had the highest energy consumption in irrigated farms with respective amounts of 281 310 and 301 639 mj ha 1 during 2006 and 2010 and 2011 and 2014 respectively walnut almond and wheat were the lowest energy consumers in irrigated farms during 2006 and 2009 2007 and 2008 and 2010 and 2014 sequentially analysis of data from 2006 to 2014 showed that the average energy consumption direct and indirect energy for irrigated and rain fed crops in the shazand watershed was about 78 594 mj ha 1 a negative connection between total factor productivity tfp growth and energy consumption in iranian agriculture investigated by moghaddasi and pour 2016 they reported that this relation might be due to cheap and wasteful energy use in this sector likewise high energy consumption particularly electricity in the agricultural sector will increase the vulnerability of the electric power industry and increasing electricity production is to be linked with enhanced greenhouse gas emissions hardin et al 2017 in the same vein mirzaei et al 2019 stated that increasing energy consumption underscore dysfunctional feedback relations between agricultural water and energy price and groundwater withdrawal in an inefficient agronomic sector 4 2 estimated water and energy productivity indicators another important indicator in this study was water productivity that importance is being paid to producing more with comparatively less water increasing water productivity kassam et al 2007 actually for producing more food income better livelihoods and ecosystem services must improve water productivity molden et al 2010 the results of water productivity of the main food crops in the shazand watershed show in table 5 and also fig 5 an estimate of water productivity and information about the affecting factors would assist in creating future plans to improve water productivity in a particular area upadhyaya and alok 2016 this index is influenced by two main factors viz the amount of water input and crop yield each kind of crops with higher water consumption has less water productivity than other crops there is a necessity to see ways to enhance water productivity by developing biological and economic output per unit of consumed water in both irrigated and rain fed agricultural systems kassam et al 2007 the results of the energy productivity of the main food crops in the shazand watershed during the period between 2006 and 2014 have been shown in table 6 and fig 5 the energy productivity of walnut watermelon almond barely was higher than other products in different years which indicates that for every input energy mj more performance is achieved mohammadi and omid 2010 beigi et al 2016 and elhami et al 2017 reported this index to be 0 80 0 01 and 0 06 kg mj respectively in this respect ball et al 2015 studied the role of energy productivity in u s agriculture for the period 1960 2004 they reported that energy productivity following the 1973 1974 global energy crisis has continued under total farm productivity the high energy productivity shows more performance and lower input energy in the system the energy productivity by hatirli et al 2006 reported 0 09 kg mj in greenhouse tomato production it can be argued that turkish greenhouse production depends on fossil fuels in this way sinha et al 2017 to find out water and energy efficient irrigation of spring sunflower during 2014 and 2015 in indian with combinations of three drip irrigation 100 80 and 60 of crop evapotranspiration stated energy productivity was higher in drip at 80 etc than 100 or 60 etc 4 3 estimated water and energy economic productivity indicators the results of water economic productivity in fig 6 showed that the maximum water economic productivity was related to the almond crop nevertheless during the period between 2006 and 2008 wheat had the lowest water economic productivity over the period 2009 2014 wheat and sugar cane had the lowest water economic productivity respectively in this regard el gafy et al 2017a compared non nexus and nexus approaches summer optimal cropping patterns for egypt the results demonstrated that the sunflower had the lowest water economic productivity they also reported that the onion had the most water economic productivity the results of energy economic productivity shown in fig 6 such as water economic productivity showed that the maximum energy economic productivity was the almond crop wheat had the lowest energy economic productivity during 2006 and 2008 on the other hand wheat and sugar cane had the lowest energy economic productivity over the study period respectively el gafy et al 2017c stated that soybean sunflower maize sesame sorghum and cucumber had the lowest energy economic productivity and the onion had the most energy economic productivity in summer cropping patterns for egypt the estimates of production of various crops for 2006 2014 have been released by the shazand province organization of jihad e agriculture in the shazand city the total production of the main food crops has been summarized in table 7 4 4 estimated water energy food nexus index of the main food crops the normalized water and energy consumption productivity and economic productivity indicators were first determined using eqs 10 and 11 then based on the previous indicators water energy food nexus index wefni for eight representative irrigated farming crops two representative orchard crops and four representative rain fed farming crops were determined for the shazand watershed in markazi province iran for the period of 2006 2014 afterwards maximization of the water energy food nexus index wefni as a resultant of combination of different indicators was also made our results showed the water and energy saving and an increase in total annual benefit under optimization the study showed that the calculated wefnis of the crops ranged from 0 05 to 0 92 0 05 to 0 76 0 05 to 0 76 0 06 to 0 83 0 09 to 0 86 0 10 to 0 86 0 11 to 0 87 0 10 to 0 87 and 0 13 to 0 88 from 2006 to 2014 as shown in table 8 in the same vein a study conducted by el gafy 2017 on analysis of water energy food nexus of egyptian crops in year 2010 proposed that wefni could be used yearly to assess the performance of the water energy food nexus management the highest and lowest wefnis of different crops represented the best and the worst performance respectively almond had the highest wefnis of 0 92 0 76 0 76 0 83 0 86 0 86 0 87 0 87 and 0 88 among the 14 study crops over the study years in this regard the land degradation neutrality ldn approach status based on the land cover use changes luc and higher net primary productivity npp and higher soil organic carbon soc metrics in orchards have been reported by kiani harchegani and sadeghi 2020 for the same study watershed the results showed that the ldn status variability during 2000 2008 2008 2016 and 2000 2016 had a net gain in relation to land use in orchards regarding improvements in the luc npp and soc metrics in orchards the changes in the ldn status are positive and show an increasing trend in net gain however potatoes with wefni of 0 05 0 05 0 05 0 06 0 09 0 10 and 0 11 sugar cane with wefni of 0 10 and cucumber with wefni of 0 13 had the lowest wefni in 2006 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively in addition the overall pattern of change in wefni of studied food crops over time has been shown in fig 7 it showed that the wefni indicator had a fluctuation over time the trends of the wefni rates provided valuable information for needs assessment program planning program evaluation and management development activities analyzing data over time also allowed for creating forecasts about future cycles and rates of occurrence examining data over time also provided for planning forecasts about future cycles and rates of occurrence as well wefni gives an indicator for decision makers about the efficiency of water energy food management by combining important variables of the nexus el gafy et al 2017b 4 5 application of the optimization model to the shazand watershed as it was already explained only one broad planning objective of maximizing the wefni was considered to optimal cropping pattern in the shazand watershed according to the availability of the land the cultivated area of each crop was restricted to a minimum and maximum boundary to provide the crop production demand the results of the optimization in the shazand watershed and comparison of the nexus approach scenario 2 and non nexus current scenario or scenario 1 have been given in table 9 our results showed that the average water saving under scenario 2 is about 3 or by 16 5 25 6 26 9 44 0 004 39 5 26 6 27 5 28 and 5 28 mcm during 2006 and 2014 the average energy saving under scenarios 2 is also about 13046608 17 12893028 13 12660667 10 64868538 53 14351215 11 15270574 11 15316001 11 16054753 11 and 16243075 11 mj during span periods of 2006 and 2014 because of changes considered in land use areas through optimization scenarios 2 the total annual benefit is ultimately about 62109086 57 70230603 54 60526585 54 50139113 47 133833833 61 121902194 55 86939365 48 59063051 42 and 55929314 40 usd during 2006 and 2014 a similar findings on water and energy savings were also reported by el gafy et al 2017a b such type of land use allocation not only provided all governing limitations existed in the study watershed but also tended to socio economic growth environmental sustainability sadeghi et al 2009 and sustainable watershed development wang et al 2004 gabriel et al 2006 sadeghi et al 2009 the outcomes of this study explained that the current situation of land use in the shazand watershed is not suitable to minimize water and energy consumption and maximize benefit these results conformed to those obtained by davudirad et al 2016 who showed changes in rangelands and rain fed agricultural lands to urban areas thanks to the expansion of industrialization and urbanization in the shazand watershed during 2000 2016 therefore it is essential to optimize land use management systems land management is an effective adaptive strategy to decrease groundwater consumption in arid and semi arid areas ahn et al 2018 leading to improve sustainable agriculture cerdà et al 2018 5 conclusion the water energy food nexus approach was successfully adopted to develop appropriate strategies for the optimal cropping patterns for the shazand watershed in central iran due to access to extremely subsidized water and energy in agriculture sector in iran and existing unsuitable land uses in the shazand watershed this thinking can help poverty reduction and generate employment opportunities among farmers and achieving sustainable development in the agricultural sector as the largest water user by minimizing water and energy usages and maximizing their productivity the analysis of water energy food nexus indicated that land management efficiency could be improved in the study watershed in different aspects through optimizing the water energy food nexus to avoid detrimental impacts on available resources actually understanding inherent nature and the connection between various resources in the farming part can lead to achieving the sustainable development of agriculture wefni uses a combination of different indicators to show the interrelations between water energy and food sources that can be used to evaluate and monitor different resources the water energy food nexus has potential to be extensively applied to other regions for identifying weak connections in natural resource management policies it is further suggested to be used to improve national sustainability policies in various sectors though more insight studies to include time and space scales are needed for drawing comprehensive conclusions using this approach we recommend developing horticultural crops rather than some crash crops such as onion potato and sugar cane besides a change for water energy food nexus index would be better justified by adding more indicators like soil as an essential commodity to achieve sustainable development the soil water energy food swef nexus would be therefore presented as a helpful approach towards higher sustainability and adaptive management at the

10656,the increasing demands of the population and the need for development obliged the optimal use and adaptive management of the watershed resources accordingly it is necessary to adopt comprehensive measures to reach sustainable development goals this objective can be achieved by the application of interdisciplinary and professional approaches through establishing dynamic and optimal balance in supply and demand resources however such important optimization approaches have been rarely practiced at the watershed scale the present study has been therefore formulated to apply a linear water energy food nexus optimization for the shazand watershed markazi province iran this approach was applied for planning 14 crops planted in orchard irrigated farms and rain fed farms between 2006 and 2014 and targeting water energy food nexus index wefni maximization the connections among the water energy and food were then evaluated through determining the amount of consumption mass productivity and economic productivity of water and energy the results of wefnis revealed that almond has the highest wefni with values of 0 92 0 76 0 76 0 83 0 86 0 86 0 87 0 87 and 0 88 whilst potato with wefni of 0 05 0 05 0 05 0 06 0 09 0 10 and 0 11 sugar cane with wefni of 0 10 and cucumber with wefni of 0 13 had the lowest scores and the corresponding lowest performance among the study crops the outcomes of optimization study explained that the current situation of land use in the shazand watershed is unsuitable to minimize water and energy consumption and maximize benefit the results can be used as an effective tool for designating proper soil and water resource management strategies in the region keywords adaptive management land use optimization livelihood security system dynamic wef nexus 1 introduction nowadays resources management in the watersheds is a vital task for the managers and planners due to the necessity of handling challenging issues existed between supply and demand sectors accordingly many researchers emphasized that water food and energy already experiencing significant stress and shortfall in the world and the demand for these resources will increase significantly over the next decades bizikova et al 2013 endo et al 2015 el gafy et al 2017a el gafy 2017 in iran according to a report from the center for strategic studies 2017 out of 100 existing challenges of the country 14 issues viz water crisis dust storms water crisis outcomes air pollution crisis destruction of biodiversity environmental non sustainability soil degradation water conflict due to consequences of inter basin water transboundary climate change energy low efficiency water pollution world energy market environmental pollution and agricultural low contribution to gross domestic product are respectively ranked as 2 7 8 15 27 30 31 33 36 38 39 44 59 and 93 and directly are related to the security of water energy and food water is needed for irrigation and food processing extraction mining refining and residue disposal of fossil fuels plant cooling hydropower bioenergy feedstock production transportation waste disposal emission control and constructing operating and maintaining energy generation facilities besides energy is needed for fertilizer production agricultural machinery food preservation and processing transport cooking and pumping irrigation water to access food to produce and supply water energy is also needed for water pumping and distribution water and waste water treatment sea water desalination constructing operating and maintaining water supply facilities and fulfilling end uses irena 2015 el gafy 2017 liu et al 2017 sahle et al 2019 the pressure of drivers such as increasing energy demand population growth societal demands urbanization economic development cultural technological changes changing life styles and climate change on water food and energy resources need to create an adaptive management approach in response to these drivers el gafy et al 2017b karan et al 2018 the purpose of the adaptation is to reduce vulnerability to climate and human changes so understanding of the complex interlinkages in the water energy food wef security nexus approach has become critically important to sustainable development and secure future for all nations and regions mohtar and daher 2012 gulati et al 2013 rasul and sharma 2016 cai et al 2018 stephan et al 2018 terrapon pfaff et al 2018 the united nations has recommended 17 sustainable development goals sdgs applicable by all countries in the world on the other hands protecting and enhancing the ability of the earth s soils to provide clean water and safe food for the humanity in agriculture will be a key element in delivering sdgs keesstra et al 2016 2018 so the present research is based on the sdgs three of which are applied to food security and sustainable management of water sdgs 2 3 and 6 in this vein new sustainable and integrated approaches like land degradation neutrality ldn and wef nexus keesstra et al 2018 kiani harchegani and sadeghi 2020 would help managers and decision makers stop increasing pressure on land resources the wef nexus approach was first conceived at the bonn 2011 nexus conference held in preparation for the united nations un rio 20 conference gulati et al 2013 biggs et al 2015 the concept of nexus among food water and energy and application of the wef nexus have been reported during last decade in different resources management and the regions in the world smajgl et al 2016 smidt et al 2016 tidwell 2016 zhang and vesselinov 2017 kantor et al 2017 holger et al 2017 hussien et al 2017 franz et al 2018 moioli et al 2018 martinez et al 2018 white et al 2018 wicaksono and kang 2019 daher et al 2019 li et al 2019 sharifi moghadam et al 2019 in fact handling more than one complex and interconnected chapters are considered in the nexus approach to achieve better results hettiarachchi and ardakanian 2016 the tools and integrated approaches for water energy food security analyses are provided through the nexus management the results of such examinations will be used by decision makers and stakeholders in practical decision scenarios the wef nexus management analyses should be capable to implement optimal approaches for managing water energy and food policies and management approaches within a sector affecting the other sectors zhang and vesselinov 2017 agriculture is the main user of the world water resources and it is essential for food production consequently the sustainability of agriculture would require the efficient management of the available finite water resources under the existing limitations garg and dadhich 2014 in the same vein to assess water sustainability a set of comparative performance indices e g water availability water scarcity water resources vulnerability social water stress water stress and the water poverty are needed which cannot be achieved without considering the water energy food nexus molle and mollinga 2003 brown and matlock 2011 juwana et al 2012 el gafy 2017 nevertheless the water energy food nexus is a necessity to create an index that not focus only on one sector such as the former indices but also examines the water and energy and to achieve the optimal cropping pattern el gafy 2017 because of the intercommunications between three sectors water energy and food security nexus any single sector approach may lead to serious unpremeditated issues bizikova et al 2013 the water energy food nexus index can be accordingly utilized as a tool to evaluate and analyze strategies that combine several aspects to reflect main concerns in the water energy food nexus with one number el gafy et al 2017c reviewing of existing and accessible literatures shows that a nexus oriented approach is required to tackle the current levels of insecurity in access to resources in the recent years focus is changing to approaches discussed upon the optimization of the nexus karnib 2017 lópez díaz et al 2017 dhaubanjar et al 2017 el gafy et al 2017a stamou and rutschmann 2018 gonzález bravo et al 2018 kan et al 2018 uen et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 nie et al 2019 esmaeli and roshandel 2020 concluding the existing literatures shows that there have been some approaches for the water energy food nexus optimization in different applications however to the best of our knowledge the study of the water energy food nexus index wefni in the field of agriculture at the watershed scale is poor in this regards the present research presents the first water energy food nexus index wefni study for iran agronomic crops and has been ultimately formulated to analyze the water energy food nexus index of 14 food crops under different subcultures irrigated and rain fed for the shazand watershed for the time period 2006 2014 next non nexus and nexus approaches were examined under two scenarios scenario1 shows the existing cropping pattern and scenario 2 describes the nexus approach by maximizing the water energy food nexus index wefni the proposed approach would therefore assist local managers to make appropriate decision based on the consumption efficiency of water food and energy as a whole it has been accordingly hypothesized that the existing managerial pattern of the agricultural land use of the study area is not optimal in the viewpoint of the wef nexus approach expediting the application of the wef nexus index with the developed optimization model would hopefully provide a powerful tool for the local decision makers to properly manage limited resources at the watershed scale 2 case study the shazand mountains watershed with an area of about 1740 km2 placed in the southwestern markazi province of iran is a sub watershed of the qareh chai watershed it is extended between 49 04 15 to 49 52 12 e and 33 44 42 to 34 12 13 n as shown in fig 1 the shazand watershed with elevation ranges from 1800 m to more than 3300 m above mean sea level the annual rainfall is also varied from 340 mm to more than 780 mm per annum with an average of some 420 mm with a moderate semi arid to cold semi arid climate it is some 40 km from southwest of arak city capital of markazi province it consisted of five towns and 107 villages and 10 counties rural district over the past decades the shazand plain has been a fertile region due to the potential for agricultural development along with industrial activities particularly and most of the inhabitants were supported by farming davudirad et al 2016 hazbavi and sadeghi 2017 sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 2 1 cropping pattern the study was conducted for 14 main food crops for the shazand watershed under irrigation i e wheat bean sugar cane potatoes onion watermelon cucumber alfalfa almond and walnut and rain fed i e wheat barley chickpea and safflower conditions for the data reported from 2006 to 2014 seven major representative categories of crops including cereals beans industrial crops vegetables cucurbits forage and orchard were considered in the shazand watershed the data were collected from the shazand province organization of jihad e jihad e agriculture shazand province organization of jihad e agriculture 2014 some other information was further accumulated from farmers through face to face interview the dominant crops and corresponding temporal variations in the region have been summarized in tables 1 and 2 3 methodology the present study was designed to evaluate the water energy food nexus of 14 different crops for the shazand watershed from 2006 to 2014 meanwhile the problem was then programmed using linear optimization to the nexus approach applying an objective function to maximize a water energy food nexus index with the help of gams software package the entire study has was formulated in five steps as planned to perform the main research purposes the details of methodology have been given in fig 2 3 1 water energy food wef nexus framework building the wef nexus framework combines three interconnected components of water food energy food and energy water as shown in fig 3 indicators are conceptual tools for sustainability evaluations that can be influential in many sectors so for the present research the interrelation between water and food was measured by water consumption water mass productivity and water economic productivity indicators in addition energy consumption energy mass productivity and energy economic productivity indicators are indicative the relationship between energy and food the connection between energy and water was therefore addressed through energy consumption due to increasing economic activity with the passage of time on the shazand watershed that might increase demand for energy by reducing the groundwater tables due to the growing pressure on groundwater resources the energy cost of lifting deeper groundwater should usually increases nabavi 2018 moreover feedback theory is established between financial development and energy consumption that attract the notice of policymakers in developing countries to develop a plan to decrease the consequences of energy consumption by managing resource saud et al 2018 the weights were also defined alike due to the limited information in the study area 3 1 1 water and energy consumption indicators the water green or rainwater and blue or irrigation water consumption indicator 1 per hectare of crop c at time t wc t m3 ha 1 in the shazand watershed was collected based on the data collected from the regional water company of markazi and the markazi province water and wastewater company iran water resources management 2015 in addition the netwat crop water calculator alizadeh et al 2008 and iran s national water resources development plan were used to obtain a dataset of average water demands for different crops in the shazand watershed netwat was improved based on iran s national water resources development plan which provides estimates of water demands for a variety of crops produced in different provinces mirzaei et al 2019 energy consumption indicator 2 is the energy consumption per hectare of crop c at time t ec t it can be can be categorized into direct i e seeds chemical fertilizers pesticide machinery and indirect energy use i e human labor diesel electricity and water for irrigation ec t has been evaluated by the sum of direct and indirect energy data on seeds chemical fertilizers pesticide machinery human labor and diesel data were obtained from the jihad e agriculture authorities shazand province organization of jihad e agriculture 2014 the raw data on electricity energy were also received from the markazi province electric distribution company https www mpedc ir and corresponding energy equivalents were calculated as follows based on the following formula energy equivalent for the machinery was calculated mohammadi and omid 2010 1 m e e g t q h where me is the machinery energy mj ha 1 e the production energy of the machine which is 93 61 mj kg 1 for the tractor and 116 mj kg 1 for the combine g the weight of the machine kg t the economic life of the machine h and qh is total working hours of the machine in a season the calculated equivalent energy has been summarized in table 3 the labor energy was also equaled using eq 2 ghaderpour and rafiee 2017 2 e l w l e i where el is the human labor energy mj ha 1 wl is the number of workers per hectare n ha 1 and ei is energy use per worker mj n 1 for a man the equivalent energy of an hour of working was supposed 1 96 mj table 3 the amount of consumptions of seed pesticide and fertilizer were collected from through the questionnaires and their equivalent energy per unit were then obtained as shown table 3 the amount of seed energy was obtained by the following expression kitani 1999 3 e s w i e i where es is energy of seed mj ha 1 wi is the amount of used seed kg ha 1 and ei energy per kilogram of seed mj kg 1 to calculate the fuel energy the following general equation was also applied chamsing et al 2006 4 e p q i e i where ep is fuel energy mj

water and energy mass productivity indicators water and energy mass productivity was used as the indicators for food valuation since the crops foods differ greatly in viewpoint of calorific and or nutritive values so that the yields of the different crops were calculated in calories per unit area of land under cultivation ha in the same vein the water and energy mass productivity were calculated in calories per cubic meters of water cal m 3 and calories per mega joule of energy cal mj 1 with the help of eq 5 el gafy 2017 5 w p t y c t w c t where yc t is the yield of crop c cal ha 1 at time t wc t is the water consumption per ha of crop c m3 ha 1 at time t the energy mass productivity indicator 4 at time t ep t was calculated by ratio between the yield of crop c and energy consumption as simply shown in eq 6 el gafy 2017 6 e p t y c t e c t where ep t is energy mass productivity at time t cal mj 1 yc t is the yield of crop c cal ha 1 and ec t is energy consumption per

energy food nexus index wefni wefni was calculated as follow el gafy et al 2017c 9 w e f n i i 1 n w i s i i 1 n w i where si is wefni s standardized indicator i wi the weight applied to each component and n the number of wefni variables the highest and the lowest values of one and zero were respectively assigned to the highest and lowest wefni for each crop since the actual values of indicators of wefni are presented in different units and magnitudes they cannot be aggregated or compared hence indicators of wefni were normalized via continuous rescaling method to produce an identical range for the values of indicators between zero and one using eq 10 given in the following general formula juwana et al 2012 10 s i x i x m i n x m a x x m i n where si is the sub index value for indicator i xi is the actual value for indicator i and xmin and xmax are the minimum and the maximum thresholds of the indicator eq 10 is utilized meanwhile the xmin of the indicator is the least selected value and xmax is the most selected value eq 10 will be modified to the following form if xmin and xmax are the most and the least preferred values respectively juwana et al 2012 11 s i 1 x i x m i n x m a x x m i n 3 1 5 optimization model this study introduces a linear optimization problem to maximize a water energy food nexus index wefni to reach an optimal cropping pattern actually the management objective of the wefni model was supposed to maximize economic water and energy and minimize water and energy use el gafy et al 2017c the general water energy food nexus index and its maximization objective function were accordingly formulated as below el gafy et al 2017a 12 w e f n i i e c e p e e v w c w p w e v 6 13 m a x z i 1 n w e f n i i a i where ec energy

is the water energy food nexus index of crop i ai is the cultivated area of crop i and n is the number of crops under consideration in the study watershed the above objective function was subjected to constraints dealing with area water and energy as formulated in eqs 14 to 16 in which ait is the cultivated area by crop i at time t aa is the total area cultivated at time t wa is the available water for irrigation and ea is the available energy 14 i 1 n a i t a a 15 i 1 n w i a i w a 16 i 1 n e i a i e a 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimated water and energy consumption indicators the results for the total volume of green the amount of rain received by the watershed and blue running water in drainage system water consumed and statistical indicators of water consumption in the agricultural shazand watershed for various crops during 2006 and 2014 are shown in table 4 and fig 4 water is a necessary input in farming and a vital resource for economic and social development hristov 2014 mirzaei et al 2019 confirmed that access to extremely subsidized water surface water and groundwater and energy has been the determination of agricultural development strategies in iran which utilizes more than 90 of total water withdrawals and provides about 10 of the gdp therefore water consumption for agronomic crop production has very overshot the renewable water supply capacity of the country making water bankruptcy a serious national security threat increasing water stress will raise the risk of water conflicts driven by water management problems madani 2010 in addition high soil and water losses reduce soil quality and finally this can decrease the quality of crops rodrigo comino et al 2018 so it is necessary to perform holistic policy improvements aimed at decreasing agricultural water consumption to alleviate the looming water bankruptcy threats consequently water consumption as a sub indicator of the water food indicator is important there are high variations of the highest and lowest water consumption in various crops over the study years however from 2009 to 2013 the highest and lowest water consumption was related to sugar cane and bean crops the energy of seeds chemical fertilizers pesticide machinery human labor diesel electricity and water for irrigation inputs per ha in the crop production system are examined in the estimation of energy consumption it is implied from fig 4 that potato and onion had the highest energy consumption in irrigated farms with respective amounts of 281 310 and 301 639 mj ha 1 during 2006 and 2010 and 2011 and 2014 respectively walnut almond and wheat were the lowest energy consumers in irrigated farms during 2006 and 2009 2007 and 2008 and 2010 and 2014 sequentially analysis of data from 2006 to 2014 showed that the average energy consumption direct and indirect energy for irrigated and rain fed crops in the shazand watershed was about 78 594 mj ha 1 a negative connection between total factor productivity tfp growth and energy consumption in iranian agriculture investigated by moghaddasi and pour 2016 they reported that this relation might be due to cheap and wasteful energy use in this sector likewise high energy consumption particularly electricity in the agricultural sector will increase the vulnerability of the electric power industry and increasing electricity production is to be linked with enhanced greenhouse gas emissions hardin et al 2017 in the same vein mirzaei et al 2019 stated that increasing energy consumption underscore dysfunctional feedback relations between agricultural water and energy price and groundwater withdrawal in an inefficient agronomic sector 4 2 estimated water and energy productivity indicators another important indicator in this study was water productivity that importance is being paid to producing more with comparatively less water increasing water productivity kassam et al 2007 actually for producing more food income better livelihoods and ecosystem services must improve water productivity molden et al 2010 the results of water productivity of the main food crops in the shazand watershed show in table 5 and also fig 5 an estimate of water productivity and information about the affecting factors would assist in creating future plans to improve water productivity in a particular area upadhyaya and alok 2016 this index is influenced by two main factors viz the amount of water input and crop yield each kind of crops with higher water consumption has less water productivity than other crops there is a necessity to see ways to enhance water productivity by developing biological and economic output per unit of consumed water in both irrigated and rain fed agricultural systems kassam et al 2007 the results of the energy productivity of the main food crops in the shazand watershed during the period between 2006 and 2014 have been shown in table 6 and fig 5 the energy productivity of walnut watermelon almond barely was higher than other products in different years which indicates that for every input energy mj more performance is achieved mohammadi and omid 2010 beigi et al 2016 and elhami et al 2017 reported this index to be 0 80 0 01 and 0 06 kg mj respectively in this respect ball et al 2015 studied the role of energy productivity in u s agriculture for the period 1960 2004 they reported that energy productivity following the 1973 1974 global energy crisis has continued under total farm productivity the high energy productivity shows more performance and lower input energy in the system the energy productivity by hatirli et al 2006 reported 0 09 kg mj in greenhouse tomato production it can be argued that turkish greenhouse production depends on fossil fuels in this way sinha et al 2017 to find out water and energy efficient irrigation of spring sunflower during 2014 and 2015 in indian with combinations of three drip irrigation 100 80 and 60 of crop evapotranspiration stated energy productivity was higher in drip at 80 etc than 100 or 60 etc 4 3 estimated water and energy economic productivity indicators the results of water economic productivity in fig 6 showed that the maximum water economic productivity was related to the almond crop nevertheless during the period between 2006 and 2008 wheat had the lowest water economic productivity over the period 2009 2014 wheat and sugar cane had the lowest water economic productivity respectively in this regard el gafy et al 2017a compared non nexus and nexus approaches summer optimal cropping patterns for egypt the results demonstrated that the sunflower had the lowest water economic productivity they also reported that the onion had the most water economic productivity the results of energy economic productivity shown in fig 6 such as water economic productivity showed that the maximum energy economic productivity was the almond crop wheat had the lowest energy economic productivity during 2006 and 2008 on the other hand wheat and sugar cane had the lowest energy economic productivity over the study period respectively el gafy et al 2017c stated that soybean sunflower maize sesame sorghum and cucumber had the lowest energy economic productivity and the onion had the most energy economic productivity in summer cropping patterns for egypt the estimates of production of various crops for 2006 2014 have been released by the shazand province organization of jihad e agriculture in the shazand city the total production of the main food crops has been summarized in table 7 4 4 estimated water energy food nexus index of the main food crops the normalized water and energy consumption productivity and economic productivity indicators were first determined using eqs 10 and 11 then based on the previous indicators water energy food nexus index wefni for eight representative irrigated farming crops two representative orchard crops and four representative rain fed farming crops were determined for the shazand watershed in markazi province iran for the period of 2006 2014 afterwards maximization of the water energy food nexus index wefni as a resultant of combination of different indicators was also made our results showed the water and energy saving and an increase in total annual benefit under optimization the study showed that the calculated wefnis of the crops ranged from 0 05 to 0 92 0 05 to 0 76 0 05 to 0 76 0 06 to 0 83 0 09 to 0 86 0 10 to 0 86 0 11 to 0 87 0 10 to 0 87 and 0 13 to 0 88 from 2006 to 2014 as shown in table 8 in the same vein a study conducted by el gafy 2017 on analysis of water energy food nexus of egyptian crops in year 2010 proposed that wefni could be used yearly to assess the performance of the water energy food nexus management the highest and lowest wefnis of different crops represented the best and the worst performance respectively almond had the highest wefnis of 0 92 0 76 0 76 0 83 0 86 0 86 0 87 0 87 and 0 88 among the 14 study crops over the study years in this regard the land degradation neutrality ldn approach status based on the land cover use changes luc and higher net primary productivity npp and higher soil organic carbon soc metrics in orchards have been reported by kiani harchegani and sadeghi 2020 for the same study watershed the results showed that the ldn status variability during 2000 2008 2008 2016 and 2000 2016 had a net gain in relation to land use in orchards regarding improvements in the luc npp and soc metrics in orchards the changes in the ldn status are positive and show an increasing trend in net gain however potatoes with wefni of 0 05 0 05 0 05 0 06 0 09 0 10 and 0 11 sugar cane with wefni of 0 10 and cucumber with wefni of 0 13 had the lowest wefni in 2006 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively in addition the overall pattern of change in wefni of studied food crops over time has been shown in fig 7 it showed that the wefni indicator had a fluctuation over time the trends of the wefni rates provided valuable information for needs assessment program planning program evaluation and management development activities analyzing data over time also allowed for creating forecasts about future cycles and rates of occurrence examining data over time also provided for planning forecasts about future cycles and rates of occurrence as well wefni gives an indicator for decision makers about the efficiency of water energy food management by combining important variables of the nexus el gafy et al 2017b 4 5 application of the optimization model to the shazand watershed as it was already explained only one broad planning objective of maximizing the wefni was considered to optimal cropping pattern in the shazand watershed according to the availability of the land the cultivated area of each crop was restricted to a minimum and maximum boundary to provide the crop production demand the results of the optimization in the shazand watershed and comparison of the nexus approach scenario 2 and non nexus current scenario or scenario 1 have been given in table 9 our results showed that the average water saving under scenario 2 is about 3 or by 16 5 25 6 26 9 44 0 004 39 5 26 6 27 5 28 and 5 28 mcm during 2006 and 2014 the average energy saving under scenarios 2 is also about 13046608 17 12893028 13 12660667 10 64868538 53 14351215 11 15270574 11 15316001 11 16054753 11 and 16243075 11 mj during span periods of 2006 and 2014 because of changes considered in land use areas through optimization scenarios 2 the total annual benefit is ultimately about 62109086 57 70230603 54 60526585 54 50139113 47 133833833 61 121902194 55 86939365 48 59063051 42 and 55929314 40 usd during 2006 and 2014 a similar findings on water and energy savings were also reported by el gafy et al 2017a b such type of land use allocation not only provided all governing limitations existed in the study watershed but also tended to socio economic growth environmental sustainability sadeghi et al 2009 and sustainable watershed development wang et al 2004 gabriel et al 2006 sadeghi et al 2009 the outcomes of this study explained that the current situation of land use in the shazand watershed is not suitable to minimize water and energy consumption and maximize benefit these results conformed to those obtained by davudirad et al 2016 who showed changes in rangelands and rain fed agricultural lands to urban areas thanks to the expansion of industrialization and urbanization in the shazand watershed during 2000 2016 therefore it is essential to optimize land use management systems land management is an effective adaptive strategy to decrease groundwater consumption in arid and semi arid areas ahn et al 2018 leading to improve sustainable agriculture cerdà et al 2018 5 conclusion the water energy food nexus approach was successfully adopted to develop appropriate strategies for the optimal cropping patterns for the shazand watershed in central iran due to access to extremely subsidized water and energy in agriculture sector in iran and existing unsuitable land uses in the shazand watershed this thinking can help poverty reduction and generate employment opportunities among farmers and achieving sustainable development in the agricultural sector as the largest water user by minimizing water and energy usages and maximizing their productivity the analysis of water energy food nexus indicated that land management efficiency could be improved in the study watershed in different aspects through optimizing the water energy food nexus to avoid detrimental impacts on available resources actually understanding inherent nature and the connection between various resources in the farming part can lead to achieving the sustainable development of agriculture wefni uses a combination of different indicators to show the interrelations between water energy and food sources that can be used to evaluate and monitor different resources the water energy food nexus has potential to be extensively applied to other regions for identifying weak connections in natural resource management policies it is further suggested to be used to improve national sustainability policies in various sectors though more insight studies to include time and space scales are needed for drawing comprehensive conclusions using this approach we recommend developing horticultural crops rather than some crash crops such as onion potato and sugar cane besides a change for water energy food nexus index would be better justified by adding more indicators like soil as an essential commodity to achieve sustainable development the soil water energy food swef nexus would be therefore presented as a helpful approach towards higher sustainability and adaptive management at the

10657,researchers are challenged to design research that can generate credible claims regarding cross scale impact and adoption however the context in which new knowledge or innovation is developed and tested may differ from that for the uptake and use of those findings this paper reports insight into the problem of designing impactful research and proposes a model to assist bio physical researchers in accounting for non biophysical context when moving between scales or settings we treat the scaling problem as the one shifting contexts the use of the model is illustrated by application in two new zealand based irrigation water use efficiency wue field studies we hypothesised that to successfully transfer the learnings from these two pilot studies to other scales it would be important to understand the influence of context on wue practices to support this process we developed a social dynamics model composite context model ccm from existing social systems frameworks the ccm maps influential non biophysical dynamics to help interpret the wue field study findings for other scales the paper represents a contribution to researchers addressing two related challenges that of making credible claims regarding the possible future impact of their research and that of translating innovations across scales by demonstrating the use of our ccm for documenting key non biophysical variables we aim to equip researchers with a practical tool to assist in the interpretation of findings across contexts that include both biophysical and non biophysical factors keywords science impact scale science uptake hydrology non biophysical context irrigation efficiency 1 introduction for both environmental friedlander et al 2013 garb and friedlander 2014 and economic corong et al 2014 reasons there is a pressing need for science to inform on farm decisions and vice versa with regard to issues related to irrigation water use efficiency wue relevant studies can provide data driven analyses that account for local terrain weather land use water availability and irrigation options e g srinivasan and elley 2019 however such studies face two related dilemmas how farm level practitioners integrate this knowledge into their decisions and how water resource managers can apply data driven analyses to differing socio economic cultural settings e g garb and friedlander 2014 the challenge of context for science is widely appreciated e g see dervin et al 2003 while researchers routinely take account of the biophysical characteristics of settings in which they develop or test hypotheses e g srinivasan and elley 2018 less well accounted for is the non biophysical context such as social and cultural as characterised by the dynamics and influences of human decision making understanding the social and cultural context is a necessary component of generating impact moore et al 2015 and is of direct relevance to developing positive agricultural water management outcomes such as improved wue and reduced loss of water and nutrients from the root zone the context in which scientific knowledge is developed and tested often differs from the context in which data driven analyses are applied calle et al 2013 nair and howlett 2015 moving from one context to another however can be complex requiring researchers to be alert to diverse barriers and opportunities and the possibility that actions in a new location will trigger unintended consequences paina and peters 2012 the problem can be expressed as that of scaling cross context or between contexts linn 2012 wigboldus et al 2016 or the scaling up and scaling out harrington et al 2001 millar and connell 2010 hermans et al 2013 of scientific research for example from the bench to the field when scaling researchers shift from one context to another where both biophysical and non biophysical aspects could vary scaling is likened to main streaming and can be thought of in terms of out scaling to describe multiplying a solution across a wider area or population e g developing and testing a soil moisture sensing technique in a few farms and applying the tested technique to a large selection of farms and up scaling to describe efforts to cultivate conditions favourable to change e g introducing regulations that would encourage the use of new soil moisture sensing technique for irrigation scheduling developing apps and web portals that would enable easy access and use of the technique for irrigation scheduling westley et al 2014 while moving across scales is challenging schulze 2000 ramiller and schmidt 2018 westermann et al 2018 not doing so risks missing the wider impacts and potential benefits of cross scale interactions on the uptake and value of science jolly et al 2012 in this paper we see the scaling problem as one of shifting between contexts scaling can never assume an unchanged or unchanging context meinzen dick 2007 furthermore we speak here of science being interpreted for another context recent publications highlight the shortcomings of technology transfer leeuwis and aarts 2011 garb and friedlander 2014 boyce et al 2018 and trend toward concepts such as co innovation or translation schut et al 2016 to convey different processual elements involved in applying findings from one context to another interpretation however embodies a sense of explaining meaning and thus assumes that a transfer of meaning cannot be taken for granted since the quest for research impact typically relies on influencing human behaviour and practice findings need to be interpreted in ways that make sense or have meaning to practitioners in different contexts this paper a collaboration between biophysical researchers and social researchers proposes a methodology for improving science uptake and the possible impact of data driven wue practices on farms we provide a social dynamics framework hereafter referred to as composite context model ccm to assist biophysical researchers to account for crucial non biophysical factors that influence field studies and their potential application elsewhere by providing a mechanism that helps to illuminate these non biophysical factors we see this paper as contributing to the activities of biophysical researchers and a potentially wider audience seeking to make sense of shifting contexts associated with movement across and between scales the ccm lays a systematic basis for field based findings to be interpreted the ccm presented in this paper documents key social variables that influence the interpretation transferability and application of scientific knowledge between contexts as will be seen the term social variables is used to encompass a broad range of human factors that influence behaviour and decisions culture practices relationships values power dynamics economic social and political pressures available technologies attitudes capabilities and interpretations after describing the ccm for documenting social variables the paper demonstrates its utility through retrospective application to two field based irrigation studies 2 methodological approach in this section we describe how delivery of a collaborative project highlighted the challenge of scaling from early proof of principle to pilot stage addressing this challenge was the catalyst for development of the ccm to systematically explore non biophysical contextual factors 2 1 genesis of the research question the genesis of this paper was an enquiry about the interpretation of changing contexts by one of the authors second author a hydrologist to another of the authors first author a social systems researcher the former led the hydrology component of a collaborative study investigating the opportunities and challenges associated with improving agricultural water management in canterbury new zealand see srinivasan et al 2017 and vereijssen et al 2017 for more information on the collaborative study a challenge surfaced when making the study findings applicable elsewhere as the work progressed from proof of principle study a to pilot study b initially study a which started in 2012 was largely based on known biophysical gradients such as soil type climate and irrigation demand and supply that impact wue see srinivasan and elley 2019 however as study a progressed the multi disciplinary research team comprised hydrologists and social science researchers noted and responded to various social political and economic dynamics that typically would fall outside a hydrology project as those dynamics seemed significant for interpreting and or applying the biophysical findings of the study more specifically the research team reported on social dynamics such as co learning with farmers srinivasan et al 2017 flexibility and adaptability srinivasan et al 2017 and the likely impacts of temporal economic and regulatory factors affecting farmers decision making fielke and srinivasan 2018 srinivasan et al 2017 following on study a the same research team initiated study b in 2016 working with a different set of farms and farmers from study a location but with the same objective of improving wue geographically studies a and b are adjacent to each other fig 1 in the first instance the issue facing the research team was how to transfer lessons learned from study a to study b however this issue provided stimulus to consider how to extend the impact of findings from a site specific study to other site i e scaling out and how to influence drivers for water efficient irrigation practices through joined up changes in the wider system i e scaling up 2 1 1 the water use efficiency pilot studies the underlying premise of studies a and b is that a more joined up approach to agricultural water management through harnessing technology and better connecting disparate data about soil moisture rainfall forecast and crop water requirements will enable farmers to make informed irrigation scheduling decisions i e applying the right amount of water at the right time to the right areas of the farm study a a five year collaborative project srinivasan et al 2017 that ran from 2012 to 2017 was carried out in the waimakariri district canterbury new zealand it was based on the hypothesis that better on farm irrigation scheduling through the provision of site specific data on crop water demand and supply forecast rainfall could improve wue the aim of the wue project was to improve on farm irrigation decisions using better characterisation of current irrigation demands and accurate accessible short term weather forecasting vereijssen et al 2017 having demonstrated proof of principle in study a a five year follow up project study b began in 2016 and on going in the neighbouring cust district canterbury new zealand 1 1 see https irrigationinsight co nz for more information on study b and the collaborative model used study b also applied a collaborative approach unlike study a however that took place in the context of an irrigation scheme with structured administrative resource and technical infrastructure study b takes place in a more loosely defined group of farmers who operate as a water users group the start of study b coincided with a change in the prevailing institutional environment as characterised by the regulatory introduction of farm environment plan s fep in canterbury feps are mandatory records of on farm management practices e g irrigation and nutrient scheduling plans that are regularly every 6 months for non compliant to every 4 years for compliant farms audited by independent regulator approved rural professionals environment canterbury 2020 the audits assess the completeness of management plans and can fail those that do not meet regulator set criteria which could impact the farming operations in this way the progression from study a to study b highlighted the shifting context challenge due to new spatial temporal and institutional parameters 2 2 selection of frameworks to describe non biophysical influences on the irrigation studies studies a and b were used as the basis of a case study to demonstrate the utility of a model for observing and documenting social variables in field based biophysical research three generic non related frameworks designed to be context independent were selected for their potential to structure observations about the interplay between contextual expertise and scientific knowledge these three frameworks are schön 1987 ulrich 2003 and shove et al 2012 we chose each of these authors for their epistemological stances that take seriously the role of diverse expertise and context in influencing outcomes for researchers working in a collaborative environment a model that attends to contextual change provides value in communicating information between different disciplines and stakeholder groups for example researchers regulators water resource managers rural professionals and farmers accordingly we developed a model from sound theories of practitioner expertise the interplay between power and diverse perspectives and the dynamics of social practice together these three frameworks equip our proposed model to document interpret and respond to contextual change we now summarise the contribution of each framework to development of the ccm the framework derived from schön fig 2 provides an umbrella model and the two other frameworks provide key concepts that inform its application schön offers a critique of the assumption that practice is simply knowledge applied e g schön 1983 he proposed the concept of the reflective practitioner as a way of recognising knowledge creation in the process of practice from schön 1987 we borrowed and developed the concept of the three artistries of reflective practice i framing of the problem ii implementation and iii improvisation ulrich 1994 offers a systematic way of critiquing validity claims by relating such claims to judgements often implicit about the assumed values and the assumed boundary of enquiry he proposed a critical systems heuristic to help make explicit the value and boundary judgements in any engagement from ulrich we borrowed his framework of four enquiries to discuss value and boundary judgements questions on the sources of i motivation ii power iii knowledge or expertise and iv legitimacy shove and colleagues have developed a practical model for describing and influencing practice shove et al 2012 they theorised that practice was always embodied in a context and describable as a configuration of materiality competency and meaning we have extended that framework by making explicit the relevance of social economic and political factors that are part of the historical context for certain examples of practice see also nicholas and foote 2020 nicholas et al 2020 in preparation after introducing schön s framework we draw on elements of the other two frameworks to demonstrate our ccm the method for demonstrating ccm s utility was to apply it to observations published or otherwise documented from study a and using study b for further exploratory testing and refinement the ccm development involved extensive discussions with the leader of study a second author a structured dialogue with farmers and rural professionals of that study and a review of associated formal reports and publications e g fielke and srinivasan 2018 srinivasan et al 2017 srinivasan and duncan 2011 3 description and application of composite context model 3 1 schön s framework science in the world of practice schön s three forms of artistry problem framing implementation and improvisation provide a useful starting point to understand the mediation of scientific knowledge in the world of practice and decision making these three artistries are each elaborated below and fig 2 shows the core of ccm representing this insight the dashed line on each side of the triangle in fig 2 represents a possible site of enquiry to understand the social context of a research setting or subsequent use of research problem framing contends that the nature of a problem has multiple and diverse interpretations what is of interest to the researcher at a given time may not be the most pressing concern of a practitioner in the field furthermore some of these views may change over time uptake and impact of science therefore depends on a perceived fit between available science a recognised problem at that time and the opportunity to translate findings into practice kingdon 1995 implementation looks beyond what solutions might work to how solutions may be carried out in practice implementation reflects real world constraints and controls such as influences associated with a period of history local resources local capabilities local power relations and local ways of interpreting the significance of a problem thus shaping the solutions offered science uptake and impact therefore depend on researchers adopting methods of communication and engagement that match the constraints and controls affecting local practice improvisation recognises that each situation has its own characteristics and will require adaptation and choices when using generic knowledge or methods local context means peculiarities of both biophysical conditions and the capabilities norms and attitudes of those implementing or influencing solutions uptake and impact of science therefore depend on researchers adapting to the local setting 3 1 1 looking a little deeper at social context the three artistries described above problem framing implementation and improvisation suggest a form of enquiry to assist researchers in documenting social variables in relation to fieldwork case studies or scaling now we describe each form of enquiry and suggest variables relevant to moving between contexts problem framing in fig 2 refers to how a problem is understood in a particular social context in table 1 we suggest the four questions or variables to be considered in relation to problem framing since the way a problem is framed may vary from one context to another we use a series of generic questions to provide a consistent way of documenting problem framing we derived the questions from ulrich 1994 who proposed questions of motivation questions of power questions of knowledge or expertise and questions of legitimacy as a basis to interrogate any claim implementation in fig 2 represents the context specific issues of timing sequencing and practices that may be implicit or explicit in generating or using knowledge in a particular setting it treats science and its uptake as rooted in a particular time and place with resource and time constraints and with human attitudes abilities and habits in other words implementation is to do with practice key implementation variables to note in documenting research and in designing for uptake would include factors that influence practice the work of shove et al 2012 suggests three elements of practice to note materiality e g objects infrastructures tools hardware and the human resources competence skills aptitudes and knowledge held by practitioners and meaning how practitioners make sense of situations we add the element of history nicholas et al 2020 in preparation through history we seek to account influences related to the moment in time that the work occupies and any influences on urgency or sequencing howlett and goetz 2014 this element can include social economic political regulatory and technological pressures that may be relevant to decision makers at the time so the variables relevant to the particular time and place that may affect implementation of science can be summarised as shown in table 2 improvisation in fig 2 refers to the way scientific knowledge is placed into context variables that need to be considered are the choices made in selecting and interpreting background science for the situation and the basis for such choices such selection and interpretation improvisation may involve researchers and or field practitioners nicholas et al 2019 relevant improvisation variables to document include the choices and adaptations that are made throughout a project in order to place science in context again we use the questions of motivation questions of power questions of knowledge or expertise and questions of legitimacy inspired by ulrich that we outlined earlier only this time the focus is on how the framing by those in the setting and the science team were responsive to the context and what adaptations were made in the selection and presentation of scientific advice variables for improvisation are outlined in table 3 summarising our use of frameworks from schön ulrich and shove et al we have produced the composite context model ccm to map social variables relevant to scaling or applying scientific findings to contexts different from that of their genesis or testing fig 3 table 4 provides a way to visualise data collection to document the contextual factors outlined in this section documentation needs to track changes in each of the variables as they are observed over time in a project in other words table 4 is intended as a guide to a living record in response to each question the format is suggestive only in practice it is more likely that observations and notes for each of the variables column four in table 4 will be kept as date stamped records linked to each of the variables see for example srinivasan et al 2019 each question listed under influencing factors in table 4 can be viewed both from the perspective of those embedded in the context of a pilot and from those offering the science as will be seen from the questions in table 4 the response to each question is bound to be subjective that is the response to each question will depend on who responds and on their perspective the way a problem is framed by either the researchers or the local practitioners may change during a multi year project this point is important when moving between contexts scaling there will be a new set of participants to consider each with their own sense of the sources of motivation power knowledge expertise and legitimacy indeed some researchers seek to involve those likely to be affected by a research programme in actively framing and guiding the research nicholas et al 2019 therefore we suggest documenting responses to the four questions several times during a project the answers will always be simply a best estimate and will remain provisional in addition to our main purpose here documenting social dynamics to aid interpretation of findings may prove useful for guiding the project 4 application of composite context model to study a we now take each part of the ccm fig 3 to illustrate its utility in study a using the ccm as a template we sought to identify key social factors that should be considered when interpreting the findings of the study a or when applying them elsewhere we draw on srinivasan et al 2017 as our principal source of insights from study a 4 1 problem framing 4 1 1 motivation the ccm asks what matters to whom and why in study a there was an initial if implicit framing by the researchers as to what matters to whom and why what mattered was improved irrigation efficiency through farmers better understanding of irrigation demand soil moisture a proxy for demand and supply forecast rainfall data to produce positive wue outcomes however through interaction with farmers other motivations emerged and needed consideration to better understand and influence farmer decision making farmers sought means to provide evidence for regulatory compliance which required irrigation losses to drainage not exceeding 20 of applied irrigation srinivasan et al 2017 other motivators included the financial impact of over irrigation and drainage and leaching losses and for some farmers the opportunity to compare their practices and farm performance with their neighbours while these diverse stakeholders had a shared interest in the efficient use of scarce water resources their focus and therefore their framing differed for example the focus of the regulator was on compliance the motivation for farmers was not only on complying but also on farm economic performance 4 1 2 power the ccm asks who controls what and what elements are considered given study a had several sites of power at work for example the irrigation scheme a company owned by farmer shareholders had its own structure and accountabilities and the regional council as the regulator determined water and nutrient use limits encouraging good irrigation practices the regulator and their regulations and the central government s expectations and requirements proved to be from the perspectives of the farmers and researchers significant in driving the demand for water efficient irrigation practice as illustrated in the quotation below in canterbury the location of the research water take consents have a number of environmental conditions attached to them these include improved wue and farm nutrient management plan feps requirements and self auditing management of water quality srinivasan et al 2017 less obvious was the relationship between the role of researchers and that of the farmer practitioners the researchers had greater access to and control over technical knowledge and information as reflected for example in the language used in the quotation below that talks about researchers provision of information to farmers the project researchers aimed to support study farmers in their irrigation decisions by providing them with customized information on current demand measured soil moisture and forecast rainfall srinivasan et al 2017 the irrigation scheme managed abstraction and distribution of water resources arguably farmers with on farm water storage facilities held greater power than their peers regardless farmers however ultimately had the power over their own irrigation practice 4 1 3 expertise the ccm asks whose expertise is considered relevant is trusted and is needed study a initially assumed that hydrological and metrological data e g soil moisture and forecast weather were the relevant knowledge appropriate to the problem and that hydrologists would bring expertise to model the data to inform on farm decisions however the project demonstrated respect for farmers own expertise this balance of expertise is highlighted in the following quote individual meetings with pilot study farmers took place periodically during the irrigation season to explore current irrigation practices to provide training on data interpretation and irrigation scheduling and to gain feedback on the project srinivasan et al 2017 4 1 4 legitimacy the ccm asks who are the arbiters of how the problem is framed conventionally in bio physical sciences researchers frame the research problem and the legitimacy of findings is subject to scientific conventions validity and reliability study a shows that engagement with farmers and the irrigation scheme resulted in changes to how the problem was framed described in detail in vereijssen et al 2017 arbitration of how the problem was framed became shared between the researchers and stakeholders farmers irrigation scheme manager regulators in the field for example the aims and scope of the project evolved in response to interactions with farmers each interaction both with individuals as well as group settings farmers irrigation scheme manager and regulators provided opportunities to obtain rich descriptive data capturing individual and collective decision making and individual and collective reaction to information provided and the co innovation processes used srinivasan et al 2017 researchers regarded stakeholders as more than science end users stakeholders actively shaped the focus and value of the project to ensure the problem defined and solutions identified were consistent and fit with the perspectives of the wider stakeholder community that is relevant to water management we involved both on farm and off farm stakeholders in the co innovation process srinivasan et al 2017 the stance of the researchers was that wue solutions needed to be demonstrable to both on farm and off farm stakeholders srinivasan et al 2017 4 2 implementation implementation represents the choices of timing and sequencing practices that may be implicit or explicit in generating or using knowledge in context study a was informed by the structures and prevailing practices of the irrigation scheme these provided an established shareholder each farmer receiving water from the scheme is a shareholder network and facilitated the exchange of knowledge and information however the irrigation scheme operated under the constraint of limited water reliability recorded in detail in srinivasan and duncan 2011 and this exerted a powerful influence on farmers irrigation scheduling decisions softer measures such as the look of the grass also contributed to farmers decisions unpublished data study a participants researchers farmers regulators and others committed to shared learning with one another from the study s emerging findings it became apparent that for farmers potential lost costs provided a useful comparative indicator of their performance vis à vis that of their neighbours these lost costs included irrigating when there was no demand for it and removal of applied irrigation and nutrients from the targeted rootzone as drainage and or overland flow study a coincided not only with a downturn in farm gate milk prices that heightened farmers awareness of costs margins and profitability but also with the introduction of feps in canterbury that required farmers to comply with new water and nutrient regulatory requirements 4 2 1 materiality what influence do social infrastructure and access to tools methods and economic constraints particular to a setting have on how the science is carried out or applied this enquiry adds to the expected descriptions of relevant biophysical characteristics of the pilot study setting e g soil type weather conditions and irrigation and the soil moisture sensing and data sharing technology detailed in srinivasan et al 2017 vereijssen et al 2017 here we focus on what distinguishes the setting in ways that could influence generalisation and or the scaling of findings to other contexts one specific socio economic reality of study a was the role of the irrigation scheme as shareholders of the co operative scheme farmers received environmental and irrigation advice from the scheme managers thus in terms of social context the scheme provided a ready made collaborative network for shared learning and problem solving a further contextual factor in study a is that even with water provided by the irrigation scheme water reliability a key driver of irrigation behaviour was only about 74 srinivasan et al 2017 which meant that farmers could go without any irrigation for a significant part of the season for instance chancellor and hide 1996 indicated that any irrigation reliability below 80 can significantly reduce productivity 4 2 2 competence what range and depth of knowledge and skills aptitudes and history of practice is particular to practitioners in this setting while study a reports do not directly answer this question some features can be noted firstly the research process appeared to have developed farmer capabilities this was partially intentional and partly a by product of working with farmers individually and in group workshops and peer learning co learning the project fostered learning this needs to be noted since any attempt to scale or generalise the findings to another context may overlook the social learning dynamic and focus instead on transferring irrigation practices derived from the study 4 2 3 meaning what has value and what needs to be true for ideas or practices to make sense in this setting this question attends to what factors from the pilot study s conclusions may be influenced by how key participants interpret the world the most obvious example of the role of meaning in study a was the shift in the study driven by farmers wanting to quantify irrigation drainage in response to regulators requirements to desire to quantify losses to the environment and financial costs to them from inappropriate irrigation scheduling the latter point offers a key insight into how farmers make meaning of their practices srinivasan et al 2017 reported that at a workshop there was a discussion on preventing irrigation wasted as drainage srinivasan et al 2017 highlighted that how irrigators interpret the setting affected their practice irrigators tend to use a just in case approach where irrigations are applied whenever supply is available even when demand is low very few farmers use the alternative practice deficit irrigation which is a just in time approach where irrigation is scheduled based on soil or crop water demand rather than supply srinivasan et al 2017 however this statement seems to overlook a human dimension of sense making or meaning in the statement above researchers interpret demand as being driven by soil and crop conditions however demand may be driven by subjective factors such as what a farmer considers the grass should look like at a certain time in the farming calendar irrigation infrastructure limitations how to fit irrigation around other farming and personal activities or feeling the need to follow neighbours activities e g srinivasan et al 2019 all of these were observed in study a srinivasan et al 2019 the attraction of collective decision making among some farmers was observed at workshops indeed this was actively promoted by the researchers to encourage a collective approach study farmers were provided access to data from all pilot farms which enabled them to compare their conditions and practices against others as well as make useful observations of others practices srinivasan et al 2017 the study a researchers noted that to be successful on farm irrigation decisions need to encompass and represent the wider system along with the constraints and opportunities it presents srinivasan et al 2017 that is on farm decisions depend on decision makers mainly farmers here making sense of the wider setting in tracking the social context of a study it is prudent to uncover and document the meaning that local stakeholders and decision makers attribute to the wider system and its constraints and opportunities see fig 1 srinivasan et al 2017 4 2 4 history what factors in this moment in history influence how science is carried out or applied in the setting and the urgency or sequencing of how it is carried out or applied one example from study a was the economic climate at the time of the project the farm gate milk price was low which made farmers sensitive to profitability and reluctant to invest on any irrigation scheduling technology the researchers sensing the reluctance presented the irrigation drainage in economic units dollars instead of depth units to communicate the significance of drainage unpublished data the researchers assigned an assumed dollar value for each millimetre of irrigation drainage and presented it as a total lost cost for the season another example significant moment in history was that study a coincided with the early stages of the regulator mandating feps and the conclusion of the matrix of good management mgm project mgm 2015 robson et al 2015 mgm was a compilation of industry agreed good management practices that included a set of recommendations for irrigation to reduce nutrient leaching and related nutrient losses of farms operating at good management the nz central government was also beginning to articulate a clear expression of environmental standards e g national policy statement for freshwater management from the new zealand ministry for the environment 2017 therefore nutrient management to address water quality issues has become the domain of national and regional governments and regulatory frameworks are currently under development in canterbury the location of this project study a water take consents have a number of environmental conditions attached to them srinivasan et al 2017 such social and political factors are specific to a time in history and need to be taken into account in interpreting findings from one context to another as they are significant drivers of behaviour and motivation 4 3 improvisation improvisation in the ccm refers to the way in which interpretation and application of scientific knowledge is contextualised for a situation improvisation involves choices as to how to utilise scientific knowledge to fit the needs of decision makers in this case farmers we use the same logical flow here exploring questions of motivation power expertise and legitimacy that we used to review framing but focus on how the framing changed during study a and how the selection and use of scientific expertise were adapted the early emphasis on irrigation scheduling and water quantity management in study a evolved to accommodate a more holistic understanding of the interactions between irrigation plant available soil moisture drainage and nutrient management this required adaptations to the research approach as the study progressed the regulator became more engaged and researchers became more receptive and attuned to a diversity of measures beyond irrigation inputs for example to allow for estimates of drainage and irrigation costings as described in the next section a challenge for researchers was to devise measures in such a way that they had legitimacy with the wider stakeholder community 4 3 1 motivation what was adapted in terms of what matters to whom and why in study a interaction with stakeholders clearly led to changes in the rationale of the project these changes led to adjustments in the scientific methods used and information presented the project was originally aimed at assisting farmers in scheduling their irrigations based on current irrigation demand and forecast weather however researchers have adapted the information provided throughout the project as they continued to learn from other perspectives represented srinivasan et al 2017 due to stakeholder workshops a new motivation emerged understanding and quantifying drainage below the rootzone this resulted in using different soil moisture sensors and conceptualising soil moisture data differently when presenting to participating farmers by including an estimate of the financial cost or lost cost of poor irrigation practices during the course of the project the definition of wue expanded from water quantity management irrigating right amount at the right time to water quantity and quality management irrigating right amount at the right time and minimizing drainage and associated nutrient loss from rootzone this broadened the scope and focus of the project srinivasan et al 2017 4 3 2 power what was adapted in terms of who controls what in relation to the perceived problem and what was assumed or taken as given one adaptation for the study a research team was recognition of the importance to farmers of a requirement by the regulator to monitor quantify and reduce drainage the interest of the regulator in irrigation practices and their regulator s role in relation to farmers prompted deliberation by the project team about how to involve the regulator as a stakeholder in project meetings 4 3 3 expertise what was adapted in terms of whose expertise is considered relevant is trusted and needed srinivasan et al 2017 is clear that the team adopted a co innovation approach and they reflected on prominent learnings that link their findings to co innovation principles a key learning is learn from each other and be flexible and adaptive when implementing co innovation the commitment to co innovation and co learning requires an openness to diverse knowledge and expertise examples of that openness in practice include learning from farmers the importance of focusing on drainage and financial costs from poor irrigation practices as well as the focus on irrigation inputs appreciating the need to include a wider network of stakeholders and discovering the significance and strength of farmer to farmer learning discussions during the workshops indicated that farmers in addition to noting the data from their own farm frequently took notice and interest in irrigation activities occurring at other farms which helped with co learning among farmers srinivasan et al 2017 also the role of the researchers as experts shifted during study a researchers moved from being a fully independent science knowledge holder and supplier in a technology transfer approach to with co innovation donning the roles of broker and facilitator srinivasan et al 2017 4 3 4 legitimacy what was adapted in terms of who are the arbiters of how the problem is framed and how success is judged as discussed in the motivation section there was a shift in the focus of the project to recognise that the problem defined and solutions identified needed to be consistent and fit with the perspectives of the wider stakeholder community srinivasan et al 2017 5 exploratory application of composite context model to study b taking the wue project from proof of principle in the waimakariri district study a to pilot stage in the cust district study b provided an opportunity to trial the application of the ccm as a framework to explore contextual similarities and differences on this basis the context of study b which in the early stages is discussed below the study is subject to ongoing review evolving over time 5 1 problem framing in terms of problem framing study b is geographically located adjacent to study a with a range of similar biophysical conditions soil type climate supply reliability and others and stakeholders the researchers statutory regulator the industry good body the dairy processing sector and rural service professionals the studies are of interest to neighbouring irrigation schemes and other water users for example hydropower generators and the general public including who use the river irrigation source for recreation however studies a and b differ with respect to power dynamics firstly although both sets of farmers are subject to the same environmental regulations the irrigation scheme acts as an intermediary between farmer shareholders and regulators in study a whereas in study b the farmer to researcher and farmer to regulator contacts are less mediated secondly study a took place under the umbrella of a wider programme of activities that examined the use of co innovation practices in nz primary sector study b is a stand alone project primarily focussed on irrigation management and subject to the scrutiny that this entails in particular the host research organisation host organisation of the second author has a keen interest in co innovation approach and this was further shaped both by researchers commitments as well as responsibilities of science impact and use to public funding bodies 5 2 implementation while implementation of study a was largely informed by the irrigation scheduling philosophy just in case just in time associated with a run of the river scheme study b was characterised by an emphasis toward an irrigation approach informed by current demand and future supply justified irrigation see srinivasan et al 2017 with respect to historical context the time elapsed between studies a and b means that the issue of wue had become more pressing feps which were coming into force during study a were in operation from the outset of study b and the farm gate milk prices on recovery 5 3 improvisation with respect to improvisation study a was characterised by increasing levels of attention on field outflows for example drainage events and this was followed through into study b informed by feedback from study a study b has placed greater emphasis on benchmarking collection and analysis of farm economic and management data and aspects of communications with both internal stakeholders as well as a wider external audience economic data collection was absent in study a 6 discussion publicly funded research is increasingly required to demonstrate impact through adoption of new knowledge behaviour change or innovations that improve economic environmental and or social outcomes e g botha et al 2014 both funders and researchers seek knowledge that is widely if not generally applicable e g vereijssen et al 2017 indeed science is often a quest for generalisable theory flyvbjerg 2001 however the quest for research impact typically relies on influencing human practices in this paper we have addressed two related challenges that of making credible claims regarding possible future impact of research findings and that of interpreting innovations across and between scales we have viewed the scaling problem as one of shifting between contexts the notion of pure science that is science without regard for its use or users pielke 2007 is challenged by expectations of impact and scalability transferability for example impact is one of the two pillars 2 2 the other pillar being research excellence underpinning nz s national statement of science investment 2015 2025 its critical role as a catalyst for economic environmental social and cultural outcomes new zealand ministry of business innovation and employment 2015 while researchers continue to strive for findings that are independent of context within the science funding regime being fit for context is considered essential we argue that scientific findings albeit that are considered theoretically robust and have been tested in case settings cannot be treated as ready for simple translation and application elsewhere field based findings are context specific and require interpretation in order to understand their impact elsewhere such interpretation requires being alert to learning about and adapting to different contexts our ccm provides an effective tool to support processes of scaling up and out however as already shown science impact requires significant engagement between researchers and user groups the focus of the ccm is on active enquiry throughout a study to note aspects of how the problem under investigation is being framed by various stakeholders how the selection and presentation of science is adapted to the situation and how both the undertaking of science and the uptake or use of findings are enabled and constrained by social practices it is a model for systematically recording and documenting key variables of social economic historical regulatory and political context that is of value in helping ensure they are taken into account when considering differing contexts such documenting may also be useful in monitoring impact over the course of a project and arguably may contribute to improved efficiencies by streamlining the scaling process or providing early signalling of potential mismatches or barriers the main purpose of this paper however is to show the ccm s utility to researchers in interpreting their insights across differing contexts the ccm provides a method to understand the possible interpretation s of scientific knowledge within and across contexts recognising the differing potential interpretations of scientific knowledge and its use value provides the researcher with a systematic approach to understanding its translatability to facilitate translation and interpretation the researcher needs to play an active role as an honest broker pielke 2007 as their engagement with users influences scaling and impact potential engagement helps to foster legitimacy with user groups especially within collaborative approaches and cultivates an opportunity to embed context and social variables within research design nicholas et al 2019 in practice a researcher should demonstrate appreciation of a group s needs and translate scientific knowledge for the group s concerns this we argue is critical to effectively help science take root our current investigation is the exploratory potential of the ccm for better understanding social variables but just how researchers can apply this approach in and then act within this complexity is still evolving the ccm is a prototype it needs more testing and improvement before general use by biophysical researchers in designing and undertaking case studies or for taking case study findings to other scales furthermore an analysis of the value this model brings to multi disciplinary research programmes requires investigation we have focused on the funding parameters of impact and scalability but increasingly science programmes are expected to be multi disciplinary our preliminary insight is that the ccm promises to better enable multi disciplinary research as it reveals the different scientific complexities and skills required in an applied wue research programme the model s application across different cultural groups and associated cultural variables also requires further insight though it does at least provide a surface level account of differences for biophysical sciences to understand finally there is the matter of how such a model encourages the loosening of predetermined research proposal outputs to become more flexible to what matters emerge during a project s lifespan studies a and b demonstrated an openness to co constituted and previously undefined outcomes with water users how this openness to emergence is reconciled within science funding rounds expectations of predetermined impact and commitments of co innovation is an ongoing challenge 7 conclusion in an effort to actively take account of human practices in relation to a wue project we found it useful to integrate three social frameworks into a practical model composite context model the three components of the model derived from schön 1983 1987 framing implementation and improvisation made visible and comparable decisions of how science was being related to a real world problem situation decisions or choices about how a problem was posed framing how potential solutions were understood and carried through to practices implementation and how available knowledge was selected and adapted improvisation can then be seen in terms of social variables the enquiries of sources of motivation power expertise and legitimacy derived from ulrich 1994 highlighted that scientific impact depended in part on the perspectives and motivations of practitioners e g farmers the above four enquiries helped to reveal whose perspectives and motivations were considered and what these may be then the notion of social practice theory derived from shove et al 2012 served to ground the research findings in the world of the local social constraints this revealed variables likely to shape local practice for example local infrastructure tools methods and economics materiality local knowledge skills aptitudes and habits competence local values and what made local sense meaning and extrinsic temporal factors history the application of ccm to a water use efficiency project illustrated how social variables are dynamic through the life of a project and not all are obvious or known at the beginning the model offers a template for progressive observations throughout a project creating a trail of insights and opportunities for adaptation by researchers and other stakeholders to emerging dynamics our intention is to support biophysical researchers lay out the important contextual aspect of their work fields so that others wishing to use their findings will be better informed to the peculiarities specifically those non biophysical in which the findings were generated and tested and to the equivalent

10657,researchers are challenged to design research that can generate credible claims regarding cross scale impact and adoption however the context in which new knowledge or innovation is developed and tested may differ from that for the uptake and use of those findings this paper reports insight into the problem of designing impactful research and proposes a model to assist bio physical researchers in accounting for non biophysical context when moving between scales or settings we treat the scaling problem as the one shifting contexts the use of the model is illustrated by application in two new zealand based irrigation water use efficiency wue field studies we hypothesised that to successfully transfer the learnings from these two pilot studies to other scales it would be important to understand the influence of context on wue practices to support this process we developed a social dynamics model composite context model ccm from existing social systems frameworks the ccm maps influential non biophysical dynamics to help interpret the wue field study findings for other scales the paper represents a contribution to researchers addressing two related challenges that of making credible claims regarding the possible future impact of their research and that of translating innovations across scales by demonstrating the use of our ccm for documenting key non biophysical variables we aim to equip researchers with a practical tool to assist in the interpretation of findings across contexts that include both biophysical and non biophysical factors keywords science impact scale science uptake hydrology non biophysical context irrigation efficiency 1 introduction for both environmental friedlander et al 2013 garb and friedlander 2014 and economic corong et al 2014 reasons there is a pressing need for science to inform on farm decisions and vice versa with regard to issues related to irrigation water use efficiency wue relevant studies can provide data driven analyses that account for local terrain weather land use water availability and irrigation options e g srinivasan and elley 2019 however such studies face two related dilemmas how farm level practitioners integrate this knowledge into their decisions and how water resource managers can apply data driven analyses to differing socio economic cultural settings e g garb and friedlander 2014 the challenge of context for science is widely appreciated e g see dervin et al 2003 while researchers routinely take account of the biophysical characteristics of settings in which they develop or test hypotheses e g srinivasan and elley 2018 less well accounted for is the non biophysical context such as social and cultural as characterised by the dynamics and influences of human decision making understanding the social and cultural context is a necessary component of generating impact moore et al 2015 and is of direct relevance to developing positive agricultural water management outcomes such as improved wue and reduced loss of water and nutrients from the root zone the context in which scientific knowledge is developed and tested often differs from the context in which data driven analyses are applied calle et al 2013 nair and howlett 2015 moving from one context to another however can be complex requiring researchers to be alert to diverse barriers and opportunities and the possibility that actions in a new location will trigger unintended consequences paina and peters 2012 the problem can be expressed as that of scaling cross context or between contexts linn 2012 wigboldus et al 2016 or the scaling up and scaling out harrington et al 2001 millar and connell 2010 hermans et al 2013 of scientific research for example from the bench to the field when scaling researchers shift from one context to another where both biophysical and non biophysical aspects could vary scaling is likened to main streaming and can be thought of in terms of out scaling to describe multiplying a solution across a wider area or population e g developing and testing a soil moisture sensing technique in a few farms and applying the tested technique to a large selection of farms and up scaling to describe efforts to cultivate conditions favourable to change e g introducing regulations that would encourage the use of new soil moisture sensing technique for irrigation scheduling developing apps and web portals that would enable easy access and use of the technique for irrigation scheduling westley et al 2014 while moving across scales is challenging schulze 2000 ramiller and schmidt 2018 westermann et al 2018 not doing so risks missing the wider impacts and potential benefits of cross scale interactions on the uptake and value of science jolly et al 2012 in this paper we see the scaling problem as one of shifting between contexts scaling can never assume an unchanged or unchanging context meinzen dick 2007 furthermore we speak here of science being interpreted for another context recent publications highlight the shortcomings of technology transfer leeuwis and aarts 2011 garb and friedlander 2014 boyce et al 2018 and trend toward concepts such as co innovation or translation schut et al 2016 to convey different processual elements involved in applying findings from one context to another interpretation however embodies a sense of explaining meaning and thus assumes that a transfer of meaning cannot be taken for granted since the quest for research impact typically relies on influencing human behaviour and practice findings need to be interpreted in ways that make sense or have meaning to practitioners in different contexts this paper a collaboration between biophysical researchers and social researchers proposes a methodology for improving science uptake and the possible impact of data driven wue practices on farms we provide a social dynamics framework hereafter referred to as composite context model ccm to assist biophysical researchers to account for crucial non biophysical factors that influence field studies and their potential application elsewhere by providing a mechanism that helps to illuminate these non biophysical factors we see this paper as contributing to the activities of biophysical researchers and a potentially wider audience seeking to make sense of shifting contexts associated with movement across and between scales the ccm lays a systematic basis for field based findings to be interpreted the ccm presented in this paper documents key social variables that influence the interpretation transferability and application of scientific knowledge between contexts as will be seen the term social variables is used to encompass a broad range of human factors that influence behaviour and decisions culture practices relationships values power dynamics economic social and political pressures available technologies attitudes capabilities and interpretations after describing the ccm for documenting social variables the paper demonstrates its utility through retrospective application to two field based irrigation studies 2 methodological approach in this section we describe how delivery of a collaborative project highlighted the challenge of scaling from early proof of principle to pilot stage addressing this challenge was the catalyst for development of the ccm to systematically explore non biophysical contextual factors 2 1 genesis of the research question the genesis of this paper was an enquiry about the interpretation of changing contexts by one of the authors second author a hydrologist to another of the authors first author a social systems researcher the former led the hydrology component of a collaborative study investigating the opportunities and challenges associated with improving agricultural water management in canterbury new zealand see srinivasan et al 2017 and vereijssen et al 2017 for more information on the collaborative study a challenge surfaced when making the study findings applicable elsewhere as the work progressed from proof of principle study a to pilot study b initially study a which started in 2012 was largely based on known biophysical gradients such as soil type climate and irrigation demand and supply that impact wue see srinivasan and elley 2019 however as study a progressed the multi disciplinary research team comprised hydrologists and social science researchers noted and responded to various social political and economic dynamics that typically would fall outside a hydrology project as those dynamics seemed significant for interpreting and or applying the biophysical findings of the study more specifically the research team reported on social dynamics such as co learning with farmers srinivasan et al 2017 flexibility and adaptability srinivasan et al 2017 and the likely impacts of temporal economic and regulatory factors affecting farmers decision making fielke and srinivasan 2018 srinivasan et al 2017 following on study a the same research team initiated study b in 2016 working with a different set of farms and farmers from study a location but with the same objective of improving wue geographically studies a and b are adjacent to each other fig 1 in the first instance the issue facing the research team was how to transfer lessons learned from study a to study b however this issue provided stimulus to consider how to extend the impact of findings from a site specific study to other site i e scaling out and how to influence drivers for water efficient irrigation practices through joined up changes in the wider system i e scaling up 2 1 1 the water use efficiency pilot studies the underlying premise of studies a and b is that a more joined up approach to agricultural water management through harnessing technology and better connecting disparate data about soil moisture rainfall forecast and crop water requirements will enable farmers to make informed irrigation scheduling decisions i e applying the right amount of water at the right time to the right areas of the farm study a a five year collaborative project srinivasan et al 2017 that ran from 2012 to 2017 was carried out in the waimakariri district canterbury new zealand it was based on the hypothesis that better on farm irrigation scheduling through the provision of site specific data on crop water demand and supply forecast rainfall could improve wue the aim of the wue project was to improve on farm irrigation decisions using better characterisation of current irrigation demands and accurate accessible short term weather forecasting vereijssen et al 2017 having demonstrated proof of principle in study a a five year follow up project study b began in 2016 and on going in the neighbouring cust district canterbury new zealand 1 1 see https irrigationinsight co nz for more information on study b and the collaborative model used study b also applied a collaborative approach unlike study a however that took place in the context of an irrigation scheme with structured administrative resource and technical infrastructure study b takes place in a more loosely defined group of farmers who operate as a water users group the start of study b coincided with a change in the prevailing institutional environment as characterised by the regulatory introduction of farm environment plan s fep in canterbury feps are mandatory records of on farm management practices e g irrigation and nutrient scheduling plans that are regularly every 6 months for non compliant to every 4 years for compliant farms audited by independent regulator approved rural professionals environment canterbury 2020 the audits assess the completeness of management plans and can fail those that do not meet regulator set criteria which could impact the farming operations in this way the progression from study a to study b highlighted the shifting context challenge due to new spatial temporal and institutional parameters 2 2 selection of frameworks to describe non biophysical influences on the irrigation studies studies a and b were used as the basis of a case study to demonstrate the utility of a model for observing and documenting social variables in field based biophysical research three generic non related frameworks designed to be context independent were selected for their potential to structure observations about the interplay between contextual expertise and scientific knowledge these three frameworks are schön 1987 ulrich 2003 and shove et al 2012 we chose each of these authors for their epistemological stances that take seriously the role of diverse expertise and context in influencing outcomes for researchers working in a collaborative environment a model that attends to contextual change provides value in communicating information between different disciplines and stakeholder groups for example researchers regulators water resource managers rural professionals and farmers accordingly we developed a model from sound theories of practitioner expertise the interplay between power and diverse perspectives and the dynamics of social practice together these three frameworks equip our proposed model to document interpret and respond to contextual change we now summarise the contribution of each framework to development of the ccm the framework derived from schön fig 2 provides an umbrella model and the two other frameworks provide key concepts that inform its application schön offers a critique of the assumption that practice is simply knowledge applied e g schön 1983 he proposed the concept of the reflective practitioner as a way of recognising knowledge creation in the process of practice from schön 1987 we borrowed and developed the concept of the three artistries of reflective practice i framing of the problem ii implementation and iii improvisation ulrich 1994 offers a systematic way of critiquing validity claims by relating such claims to judgements often implicit about the assumed values and the assumed boundary of enquiry he proposed a critical systems heuristic to help make explicit the value and boundary judgements in any engagement from ulrich we borrowed his framework of four enquiries to discuss value and boundary judgements questions on the sources of i motivation ii power iii knowledge or expertise and iv legitimacy shove and colleagues have developed a practical model for describing and influencing practice shove et al 2012 they theorised that practice was always embodied in a context and describable as a configuration of materiality competency and meaning we have extended that framework by making explicit the relevance of social economic and political factors that are part of the historical context for certain examples of practice see also nicholas and foote 2020 nicholas et al 2020 in preparation after introducing schön s framework we draw on elements of the other two frameworks to demonstrate our ccm the method for demonstrating ccm s utility was to apply it to observations published or otherwise documented from study a and using study b for further exploratory testing and refinement the ccm development involved extensive discussions with the leader of study a second author a structured dialogue with farmers and rural professionals of that study and a review of associated formal reports and publications e g fielke and srinivasan 2018 srinivasan et al 2017 srinivasan and duncan 2011 3 description and application of composite context model 3 1 schön s framework science in the world of practice schön s three forms of artistry problem framing implementation and improvisation provide a useful starting point to understand the mediation of scientific knowledge in the world of practice and decision making these three artistries are each elaborated below and fig 2 shows the core of ccm representing this insight the dashed line on each side of the triangle in fig 2 represents a possible site of enquiry to understand the social context of a research setting or subsequent use of research problem framing contends that the nature of a problem has multiple and diverse interpretations what is of interest to the researcher at a given time may not be the most pressing concern of a practitioner in the field furthermore some of these views may change over time uptake and impact of science therefore depends on a perceived fit between available science a recognised problem at that time and the opportunity to translate findings into practice kingdon 1995 implementation looks beyond what solutions might work to how solutions may be carried out in practice implementation reflects real world constraints and controls such as influences associated with a period of history local resources local capabilities local power relations and local ways of interpreting the significance of a problem thus shaping the solutions offered science uptake and impact therefore depend on researchers adopting methods of communication and engagement that match the constraints and controls affecting local practice improvisation recognises that each situation has its own characteristics and will require adaptation and choices when using generic knowledge or methods local context means peculiarities of both biophysical conditions and the capabilities norms and attitudes of those implementing or influencing solutions uptake and impact of science therefore depend on researchers adapting to the local setting 3 1 1 looking a little deeper at social context the three artistries described above problem framing implementation and improvisation suggest a form of enquiry to assist researchers in documenting social variables in relation to fieldwork case studies or scaling now we describe each form of enquiry and suggest variables relevant to moving between contexts problem framing in fig 2 refers to how a problem is understood in a particular social context in table 1 we suggest the four questions or variables to be considered in relation to problem framing since the way a problem is framed may vary from one context to another we use a series of generic questions to provide a consistent way of documenting problem framing we derived the questions from ulrich 1994 who proposed questions of motivation questions of power questions of knowledge or expertise and questions of legitimacy as a basis to interrogate any claim implementation in fig 2 represents the context specific issues of timing sequencing and practices that may be implicit or explicit in generating or using knowledge in a particular setting it treats science and its uptake as rooted in a particular time and place with resource and time constraints and with human attitudes abilities and habits in other words implementation is to do with practice key implementation variables to note in documenting research and in designing for uptake would include factors that influence practice the work of shove et al 2012 suggests three elements of practice to note materiality e g objects infrastructures tools hardware and the human resources competence skills aptitudes and knowledge held by practitioners and meaning how practitioners make sense of situations we add the element of history nicholas et al 2020 in preparation through history we seek to account influences related to the moment in time that the work occupies and any influences on urgency or sequencing howlett and goetz 2014 this element can include social economic political regulatory and technological pressures that may be relevant to decision makers at the time so the variables relevant to the particular time and place that may affect implementation of science can be summarised as shown in table 2 improvisation in fig 2 refers to the way scientific knowledge is placed into context variables that need to be considered are the choices made in selecting and interpreting background science for the situation and the basis for such choices such selection and interpretation improvisation may involve researchers and or field practitioners nicholas et al 2019 relevant improvisation variables to document include the choices and adaptations that are made throughout a project in order to place science in context again we use the questions of motivation questions of power questions of knowledge or expertise and questions of legitimacy inspired by ulrich that we outlined earlier only this time the focus is on how the framing by those in the setting and the science team were responsive to the context and what adaptations were made in the selection and presentation of scientific advice variables for improvisation are outlined in table 3 summarising our use of frameworks from schön ulrich and shove et al we have produced the composite context model ccm to map social variables relevant to scaling or applying scientific findings to contexts different from that of their genesis or testing fig 3 table 4 provides a way to visualise data collection to document the contextual factors outlined in this section documentation needs to track changes in each of the variables as they are observed over time in a project in other words table 4 is intended as a guide to a living record in response to each question the format is suggestive only in practice it is more likely that observations and notes for each of the variables column four in table 4 will be kept as date stamped records linked to each of the variables see for example srinivasan et al 2019 each question listed under influencing factors in table 4 can be viewed both from the perspective of those embedded in the context of a pilot and from those offering the science as will be seen from the questions in table 4 the response to each question is bound to be subjective that is the response to each question will depend on who responds and on their perspective the way a problem is framed by either the researchers or the local practitioners may change during a multi year project this point is important when moving between contexts scaling there will be a new set of participants to consider each with their own sense of the sources of motivation power knowledge expertise and legitimacy indeed some researchers seek to involve those likely to be affected by a research programme in actively framing and guiding the research nicholas et al 2019 therefore we suggest documenting responses to the four questions several times during a project the answers will always be simply a best estimate and will remain provisional in addition to our main purpose here documenting social dynamics to aid interpretation of findings may prove useful for guiding the project 4 application of composite context model to study a we now take each part of the ccm fig 3 to illustrate its utility in study a using the ccm as a template we sought to identify key social factors that should be considered when interpreting the findings of the study a or when applying them elsewhere we draw on srinivasan et al 2017 as our principal source of insights from study a 4 1 problem framing 4 1 1 motivation the ccm asks what matters to whom and why in study a there was an initial if implicit framing by the researchers as to what matters to whom and why what mattered was improved irrigation efficiency through farmers better understanding of irrigation demand soil moisture a proxy for demand and supply forecast rainfall data to produce positive wue outcomes however through interaction with farmers other motivations emerged and needed consideration to better understand and influence farmer decision making farmers sought means to provide evidence for regulatory compliance which required irrigation losses to drainage not exceeding 20 of applied irrigation srinivasan et al 2017 other motivators included the financial impact of over irrigation and drainage and leaching losses and for some farmers the opportunity to compare their practices and farm performance with their neighbours while these diverse stakeholders had a shared interest in the efficient use of scarce water resources their focus and therefore their framing differed for example the focus of the regulator was on compliance the motivation for farmers was not only on complying but also on farm economic performance 4 1 2 power the ccm asks who controls what and what elements are considered given study a had several sites of power at work for example the irrigation scheme a company owned by farmer shareholders had its own structure and accountabilities and the regional council as the regulator determined water and nutrient use limits encouraging good irrigation practices the regulator and their regulations and the central government s expectations and requirements proved to be from the perspectives of the farmers and researchers significant in driving the demand for water efficient irrigation practice as illustrated in the quotation below in canterbury the location of the research water take consents have a number of environmental conditions attached to them these include improved wue and farm nutrient management plan feps requirements and self auditing management of water quality srinivasan et al 2017 less obvious was the relationship between the role of researchers and that of the farmer practitioners the researchers had greater access to and control over technical knowledge and information as reflected for example in the language used in the quotation below that talks about researchers provision of information to farmers the project researchers aimed to support study farmers in their irrigation decisions by providing them with customized information on current demand measured soil moisture and forecast rainfall srinivasan et al 2017 the irrigation scheme managed abstraction and distribution of water resources arguably farmers with on farm water storage facilities held greater power than their peers regardless farmers however ultimately had the power over their own irrigation practice 4 1 3 expertise the ccm asks whose expertise is considered relevant is trusted and is needed study a initially assumed that hydrological and metrological data e g soil moisture and forecast weather were the relevant knowledge appropriate to the problem and that hydrologists would bring expertise to model the data to inform on farm decisions however the project demonstrated respect for farmers own expertise this balance of expertise is highlighted in the following quote individual meetings with pilot study farmers took place periodically during the irrigation season to explore current irrigation practices to provide training on data interpretation and irrigation scheduling and to gain feedback on the project srinivasan et al 2017 4 1 4 legitimacy the ccm asks who are the arbiters of how the problem is framed conventionally in bio physical sciences researchers frame the research problem and the legitimacy of findings is subject to scientific conventions validity and reliability study a shows that engagement with farmers and the irrigation scheme resulted in changes to how the problem was framed described in detail in vereijssen et al 2017 arbitration of how the problem was framed became shared between the researchers and stakeholders farmers irrigation scheme manager regulators in the field for example the aims and scope of the project evolved in response to interactions with farmers each interaction both with individuals as well as group settings farmers irrigation scheme manager and regulators provided opportunities to obtain rich descriptive data capturing individual and collective decision making and individual and collective reaction to information provided and the co innovation processes used srinivasan et al 2017 researchers regarded stakeholders as more than science end users stakeholders actively shaped the focus and value of the project to ensure the problem defined and solutions identified were consistent and fit with the perspectives of the wider stakeholder community that is relevant to water management we involved both on farm and off farm stakeholders in the co innovation process srinivasan et al 2017 the stance of the researchers was that wue solutions needed to be demonstrable to both on farm and off farm stakeholders srinivasan et al 2017 4 2 implementation implementation represents the choices of timing and sequencing practices that may be implicit or explicit in generating or using knowledge in context study a was informed by the structures and prevailing practices of the irrigation scheme these provided an established shareholder each farmer receiving water from the scheme is a shareholder network and facilitated the exchange of knowledge and information however the irrigation scheme operated under the constraint of limited water reliability recorded in detail in srinivasan and duncan 2011 and this exerted a powerful influence on farmers irrigation scheduling decisions softer measures such as the look of the grass also contributed to farmers decisions unpublished data study a participants researchers farmers regulators and others committed to shared learning with one another from the study s emerging findings it became apparent that for farmers potential lost costs provided a useful comparative indicator of their performance vis à vis that of their neighbours these lost costs included irrigating when there was no demand for it and removal of applied irrigation and nutrients from the targeted rootzone as drainage and or overland flow study a coincided not only with a downturn in farm gate milk prices that heightened farmers awareness of costs margins and profitability but also with the introduction of feps in canterbury that required farmers to comply with new water and nutrient regulatory requirements 4 2 1 materiality what influence do social infrastructure and access to tools methods and economic constraints particular to a setting have on how the science is carried out or applied this enquiry adds to the expected descriptions of relevant biophysical characteristics of the pilot study setting e g soil type weather conditions and irrigation and the soil moisture sensing and data sharing technology detailed in srinivasan et al 2017 vereijssen et al 2017 here we focus on what distinguishes the setting in ways that could influence generalisation and or the scaling of findings to other contexts one specific socio economic reality of study a was the role of the irrigation scheme as shareholders of the co operative scheme farmers received environmental and irrigation advice from the scheme managers thus in terms of social context the scheme provided a ready made collaborative network for shared learning and problem solving a further contextual factor in study a is that even with water provided by the irrigation scheme water reliability a key driver of irrigation behaviour was only about 74 srinivasan et al 2017 which meant that farmers could go without any irrigation for a significant part of the season for instance chancellor and hide 1996 indicated that any irrigation reliability below 80 can significantly reduce productivity 4 2 2 competence what range and depth of knowledge and skills aptitudes and history of practice is particular to practitioners in this setting while study a reports do not directly answer this question some features can be noted firstly the research process appeared to have developed farmer capabilities this was partially intentional and partly a by product of working with farmers individually and in group workshops and peer learning co learning the project fostered learning this needs to be noted since any attempt to scale or generalise the findings to another context may overlook the social learning dynamic and focus instead on transferring irrigation practices derived from the study 4 2 3 meaning what has value and what needs to be true for ideas or practices to make sense in this setting this question attends to what factors from the pilot study s conclusions may be influenced by how key participants interpret the world the most obvious example of the role of meaning in study a was the shift in the study driven by farmers wanting to quantify irrigation drainage in response to regulators requirements to desire to quantify losses to the environment and financial costs to them from inappropriate irrigation scheduling the latter point offers a key insight into how farmers make meaning of their practices srinivasan et al 2017 reported that at a workshop there was a discussion on preventing irrigation wasted as drainage srinivasan et al 2017 highlighted that how irrigators interpret the setting affected their practice irrigators tend to use a just in case approach where irrigations are applied whenever supply is available even when demand is low very few farmers use the alternative practice deficit irrigation which is a just in time approach where irrigation is scheduled based on soil or crop water demand rather than supply srinivasan et al 2017 however this statement seems to overlook a human dimension of sense making or meaning in the statement above researchers interpret demand as being driven by soil and crop conditions however demand may be driven by subjective factors such as what a farmer considers the grass should look like at a certain time in the farming calendar irrigation infrastructure limitations how to fit irrigation around other farming and personal activities or feeling the need to follow neighbours activities e g srinivasan et al 2019 all of these were observed in study a srinivasan et al 2019 the attraction of collective decision making among some farmers was observed at workshops indeed this was actively promoted by the researchers to encourage a collective approach study farmers were provided access to data from all pilot farms which enabled them to compare their conditions and practices against others as well as make useful observations of others practices srinivasan et al 2017 the study a researchers noted that to be successful on farm irrigation decisions need to encompass and represent the wider system along with the constraints and opportunities it presents srinivasan et al 2017 that is on farm decisions depend on decision makers mainly farmers here making sense of the wider setting in tracking the social context of a study it is prudent to uncover and document the meaning that local stakeholders and decision makers attribute to the wider system and its constraints and opportunities see fig 1 srinivasan et al 2017 4 2 4 history what factors in this moment in history influence how science is carried out or applied in the setting and the urgency or sequencing of how it is carried out or applied one example from study a was the economic climate at the time of the project the farm gate milk price was low which made farmers sensitive to profitability and reluctant to invest on any irrigation scheduling technology the researchers sensing the reluctance presented the irrigation drainage in economic units dollars instead of depth units to communicate the significance of drainage unpublished data the researchers assigned an assumed dollar value for each millimetre of irrigation drainage and presented it as a total lost cost for the season another example significant moment in history was that study a coincided with the early stages of the regulator mandating feps and the conclusion of the matrix of good management mgm project mgm 2015 robson et al 2015 mgm was a compilation of industry agreed good management practices that included a set of recommendations for irrigation to reduce nutrient leaching and related nutrient losses of farms operating at good management the nz central government was also beginning to articulate a clear expression of environmental standards e g national policy statement for freshwater management from the new zealand ministry for the environment 2017 therefore nutrient management to address water quality issues has become the domain of national and regional governments and regulatory frameworks are currently under development in canterbury the location of this project study a water take consents have a number of environmental conditions attached to them srinivasan et al 2017 such social and political factors are specific to a time in history and need to be taken into account in interpreting findings from one context to another as they are significant drivers of behaviour and motivation 4 3 improvisation improvisation in the ccm refers to the way in which interpretation and application of scientific knowledge is contextualised for a situation improvisation involves choices as to how to utilise scientific knowledge to fit the needs of decision makers in this case farmers we use the same logical flow here exploring questions of motivation power expertise and legitimacy that we used to review framing but focus on how the framing changed during study a and how the selection and use of scientific expertise were adapted the early emphasis on irrigation scheduling and water quantity management in study a evolved to accommodate a more holistic understanding of the interactions between irrigation plant available soil moisture drainage and nutrient management this required adaptations to the research approach as the study progressed the regulator became more engaged and researchers became more receptive and attuned to a diversity of measures beyond irrigation inputs for example to allow for estimates of drainage and irrigation costings as described in the next section a challenge for researchers was to devise measures in such a way that they had legitimacy with the wider stakeholder community 4 3 1 motivation what was adapted in terms of what matters to whom and why in study a interaction with stakeholders clearly led to changes in the rationale of the project these changes led to adjustments in the scientific methods used and information presented the project was originally aimed at assisting farmers in scheduling their irrigations based on current irrigation demand and forecast weather however researchers have adapted the information provided throughout the project as they continued to learn from other perspectives represented srinivasan et al 2017 due to stakeholder workshops a new motivation emerged understanding and quantifying drainage below the rootzone this resulted in using different soil moisture sensors and conceptualising soil moisture data differently when presenting to participating farmers by including an estimate of the financial cost or lost cost of poor irrigation practices during the course of the project the definition of wue expanded from water quantity management irrigating right amount at the right time to water quantity and quality management irrigating right amount at the right time and minimizing drainage and associated nutrient loss from rootzone this broadened the scope and focus of the project srinivasan et al 2017 4 3 2 power what was adapted in terms of who controls what in relation to the perceived problem and what was assumed or taken as given one adaptation for the study a research team was recognition of the importance to farmers of a requirement by the regulator to monitor quantify and reduce drainage the interest of the regulator in irrigation practices and their regulator s role in relation to farmers prompted deliberation by the project team about how to involve the regulator as a stakeholder in project meetings 4 3 3 expertise what was adapted in terms of whose expertise is considered relevant is trusted and needed srinivasan et al 2017 is clear that the team adopted a co innovation approach and they reflected on prominent learnings that link their findings to co innovation principles a key learning is learn from each other and be flexible and adaptive when implementing co innovation the commitment to co innovation and co learning requires an openness to diverse knowledge and expertise examples of that openness in practice include learning from farmers the importance of focusing on drainage and financial costs from poor irrigation practices as well as the focus on irrigation inputs appreciating the need to include a wider network of stakeholders and discovering the significance and strength of farmer to farmer learning discussions during the workshops indicated that farmers in addition to noting the data from their own farm frequently took notice and interest in irrigation activities occurring at other farms which helped with co learning among farmers srinivasan et al 2017 also the role of the researchers as experts shifted during study a researchers moved from being a fully independent science knowledge holder and supplier in a technology transfer approach to with co innovation donning the roles of broker and facilitator srinivasan et al 2017 4 3 4 legitimacy what was adapted in terms of who are the arbiters of how the problem is framed and how success is judged as discussed in the motivation section there was a shift in the focus of the project to recognise that the problem defined and solutions identified needed to be consistent and fit with the perspectives of the wider stakeholder community srinivasan et al 2017 5 exploratory application of composite context model to study b taking the wue project from proof of principle in the waimakariri district study a to pilot stage in the cust district study b provided an opportunity to trial the application of the ccm as a framework to explore contextual similarities and differences on this basis the context of study b which in the early stages is discussed below the study is subject to ongoing review evolving over time 5 1 problem framing in terms of problem framing study b is geographically located adjacent to study a with a range of similar biophysical conditions soil type climate supply reliability and others and stakeholders the researchers statutory regulator the industry good body the dairy processing sector and rural service professionals the studies are of interest to neighbouring irrigation schemes and other water users for example hydropower generators and the general public including who use the river irrigation source for recreation however studies a and b differ with respect to power dynamics firstly although both sets of farmers are subject to the same environmental regulations the irrigation scheme acts as an intermediary between farmer shareholders and regulators in study a whereas in study b the farmer to researcher and farmer to regulator contacts are less mediated secondly study a took place under the umbrella of a wider programme of activities that examined the use of co innovation practices in nz primary sector study b is a stand alone project primarily focussed on irrigation management and subject to the scrutiny that this entails in particular the host research organisation host organisation of the second author has a keen interest in co innovation approach and this was further shaped both by researchers commitments as well as responsibilities of science impact and use to public funding bodies 5 2 implementation while implementation of study a was largely informed by the irrigation scheduling philosophy just in case just in time associated with a run of the river scheme study b was characterised by an emphasis toward an irrigation approach informed by current demand and future supply justified irrigation see srinivasan et al 2017 with respect to historical context the time elapsed between studies a and b means that the issue of wue had become more pressing feps which were coming into force during study a were in operation from the outset of study b and the farm gate milk prices on recovery 5 3 improvisation with respect to improvisation study a was characterised by increasing levels of attention on field outflows for example drainage events and this was followed through into study b informed by feedback from study a study b has placed greater emphasis on benchmarking collection and analysis of farm economic and management data and aspects of communications with both internal stakeholders as well as a wider external audience economic data collection was absent in study a 6 discussion publicly funded research is increasingly required to demonstrate impact through adoption of new knowledge behaviour change or innovations that improve economic environmental and or social outcomes e g botha et al 2014 both funders and researchers seek knowledge that is widely if not generally applicable e g vereijssen et al 2017 indeed science is often a quest for generalisable theory flyvbjerg 2001 however the quest for research impact typically relies on influencing human practices in this paper we have addressed two related challenges that of making credible claims regarding possible future impact of research findings and that of interpreting innovations across and between scales we have viewed the scaling problem as one of shifting between contexts the notion of pure science that is science without regard for its use or users pielke 2007 is challenged by expectations of impact and scalability transferability for example impact is one of the two pillars 2 2 the other pillar being research excellence underpinning nz s national statement of science investment 2015 2025 its critical role as a catalyst for economic environmental social and cultural outcomes new zealand ministry of business innovation and employment 2015 while researchers continue to strive for findings that are independent of context within the science funding regime being fit for context is considered essential we argue that scientific findings albeit that are considered theoretically robust and have been tested in case settings cannot be treated as ready for simple translation and application elsewhere field based findings are context specific and require interpretation in order to understand their impact elsewhere such interpretation requires being alert to learning about and adapting to different contexts our ccm provides an effective tool to support processes of scaling up and out however as already shown science impact requires significant engagement between researchers and user groups the focus of the ccm is on active enquiry throughout a study to note aspects of how the problem under investigation is being framed by various stakeholders how the selection and presentation of science is adapted to the situation and how both the undertaking of science and the uptake or use of findings are enabled and constrained by social practices it is a model for systematically recording and documenting key variables of social economic historical regulatory and political context that is of value in helping ensure they are taken into account when considering differing contexts such documenting may also be useful in monitoring impact over the course of a project and arguably may contribute to improved efficiencies by streamlining the scaling process or providing early signalling of potential mismatches or barriers the main purpose of this paper however is to show the ccm s utility to researchers in interpreting their insights across differing contexts the ccm provides a method to understand the possible interpretation s of scientific knowledge within and across contexts recognising the differing potential interpretations of scientific knowledge and its use value provides the researcher with a systematic approach to understanding its translatability to facilitate translation and interpretation the researcher needs to play an active role as an honest broker pielke 2007 as their engagement with users influences scaling and impact potential engagement helps to foster legitimacy with user groups especially within collaborative approaches and cultivates an opportunity to embed context and social variables within research design nicholas et al 2019 in practice a researcher should demonstrate appreciation of a group s needs and translate scientific knowledge for the group s concerns this we argue is critical to effectively help science take root our current investigation is the exploratory potential of the ccm for better understanding social variables but just how researchers can apply this approach in and then act within this complexity is still evolving the ccm is a prototype it needs more testing and improvement before general use by biophysical researchers in designing and undertaking case studies or for taking case study findings to other scales furthermore an analysis of the value this model brings to multi disciplinary research programmes requires investigation we have focused on the funding parameters of impact and scalability but increasingly science programmes are expected to be multi disciplinary our preliminary insight is that the ccm promises to better enable multi disciplinary research as it reveals the different scientific complexities and skills required in an applied wue research programme the model s application across different cultural groups and associated cultural variables also requires further insight though it does at least provide a surface level account of differences for biophysical sciences to understand finally there is the matter of how such a model encourages the loosening of predetermined research proposal outputs to become more flexible to what matters emerge during a project s lifespan studies a and b demonstrated an openness to co constituted and previously undefined outcomes with water users how this openness to emergence is reconciled within science funding rounds expectations of predetermined impact and commitments of co innovation is an ongoing challenge 7 conclusion in an effort to actively take account of human practices in relation to a wue project we found it useful to integrate three social frameworks into a practical model composite context model the three components of the model derived from schön 1983 1987 framing implementation and improvisation made visible and comparable decisions of how science was being related to a real world problem situation decisions or choices about how a problem was posed framing how potential solutions were understood and carried through to practices implementation and how available knowledge was selected and adapted improvisation can then be seen in terms of social variables the enquiries of sources of motivation power expertise and legitimacy derived from ulrich 1994 highlighted that scientific impact depended in part on the perspectives and motivations of practitioners e g farmers the above four enquiries helped to reveal whose perspectives and motivations were considered and what these may be then the notion of social practice theory derived from shove et al 2012 served to ground the research findings in the world of the local social constraints this revealed variables likely to shape local practice for example local infrastructure tools methods and economics materiality local knowledge skills aptitudes and habits competence local values and what made local sense meaning and extrinsic temporal factors history the application of ccm to a water use efficiency project illustrated how social variables are dynamic through the life of a project and not all are obvious or known at the beginning the model offers a template for progressive observations throughout a project creating a trail of insights and opportunities for adaptation by researchers and other stakeholders to emerging dynamics our intention is to support biophysical researchers lay out the important contextual aspect of their work fields so that others wishing to use their findings will be better informed to the peculiarities specifically those non biophysical in which the findings were generated and tested and to the equivalent variables in their own settings the paper represents a contribution to researchers addressing two related challenges that of making credible claims for possible future impact of research findings and

10658,the simple algorithm for evapotranspiration retrieving safer can be used to estimate surface evapotranspiration in the process of safer parameterization the reference evapotranspiration eto calculated by the penman monteith pm method was included however methodologies for estimating eto that use fewer meteorological variables should be sought mainly to increase the applicability of the method in regions where there are no complete weather stations thus the objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the eto calculated with estimated data on the calculation of surface evapotranspiration using safer etsafer in the brazilian semiarid region the study was carried out in areas of centre pivots cultivated with sugarcane located in the public irrigated perimeter of jaíba mg brazil eto and its impact on etsafer were analysed using meteorological data from a station belonging to the national institute of meteorology inmet as well as data from 19 images of the landsat 8 satellite from 2013 2014 and 2016 the etsafer responses were analysed from the calculations of eto estimated by the hargreaves samani hs and pm methods with missing data including single absences of solar radiation rs wind speed u2 relative humidity rh and combined absences of u2 and rh u2 rh and rs rs and u2 and rs and rh the temporal and spatial variability of etsafer for sugarcane crops was

the different methodologies were then used to calculate etsafer according to the flowchart presented in fig 3 for the area of the three center pivots cultivated with sugarcane fig 4 presents a routine that represents the sequence in which the etsafer values were extracted to evaluate the performance of the methodologies used fig 4 1 shows the map with the etsafer values of only one center pivot these values were used to create a boxplot which allowed the data to be separated into four distinct groups in fig 4 2 the grids in yellow are those that showed the etsafer values concentrated in the interquartile interval i e the 2nd and 3rd quartiles allowing the creation of the raster to create the extraction points the raster was converted to a vector fig 4 3 which was delimited by the shapefile of the pivot perimeter fig 4 4 only data from the interquartile interval were selected according to bingham 1996 and grassini et al 2014 thus clipping the area of interest fig 4 6 after clipping 20 random points were created to extract the values of etsafer fig 4 7 thus it was possible to extract all etsafer products in the same pixel considering the product obtained with the eto estimated by the pm method with complete data as a reference in the different values of the images generated fig 4 8 thus a total of 1 440 values of etsafer over three years were generated using each eto estimation methodology considering that eight eto estimation models were executed a total of 11 520 values of etsafer were generated to evaluate the performance of the methods the models were evaluated by the statistical indices of mean bias error mbe mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r² calculated by eqs 9 12 the mbe was used to indicate the tendency of models to underestimate or overestimate the etsafer values the mae was used to evaluate the accuracy of the models r2 was used to assess the precision and rmse was used to evaluate the degree of scattering of the data caused by the presence of outliers the latter justifies the elimination of data with spurious values outliers diagnosed in the boxplot čadro et al 2017 silva 2018a 9 m

etsafer with eto calculated by pm fao56 and with limited data respectively path and principal component analyses were performed to describe the influence of input parameters meteorological data on the pm model these same analyses were carried out to verify which methods studied with limited data showed greater proximity to the pm method 3 results and discussion solar radiation rs has the highest direct correlation among the input parameters in the penman monteith pm equation to estimate reference evapotranspiration eto as verified in the path analysis shown in fig 5 b this same result was observed in principal component analysis fig 5a in principal component analysis fig 5a the methodologies for estimating eto that used missing data of wind speed u2 and relative humidity rh either single or combined showed higher correlations with the eto values estimated by pm with complete data it is worth noting that the methodologies that used missing data of u2 and rh were also those that used measured data of rs these results showed that rs contributed a greater proportion to the eto estimation than did the aerodynamic factors corroborating gassmann et al 2019 thus the result demonstrates the importance of accurately measuring or estimating rs to ensure the adequate estimation of eto corroborating mokhtari et al 2018 and paredes and pereira 2019 the proposed method by pm with missing data has better performance when rs is measured and the other parameters are estimated thus predicting meteorological information to estimate eto by pm as observed in fig 5 has better performance than other models such as hs for the estimation of eto this result corroborates those found in other studies such as those conducted by silva et al 2018a and singh rawat et al 2019 in semiarid regions and by ferreira et al 2019 in different climatic regions the eto values estimated by the different methodologies had a visible impact on the estimated values of etsafer as shown in fig 6 the behaviour observed in the multivariate analysis fig 5 is also verified in the mapping of etsafer fig 6 the values of etsafer calculated with the eto estimated by pm with complete data standard etsafer figure 6a showed behaviour similar to that of the etsafer values obtained with eto estimated with missing data of u2 and rh fig 6b c and f on the other hand the etsafer estimation was hampered in the methodologies that did not use measured rs fig 6d e g and i the etsafer obtained with the eto estimated by the hargreaves samani method fig 5i showed much higher values than those of standard etsafer these results suggest higher water demand by sugarcane and higher water consumption thus the methodology for obtaining etsafer through the eto estimated by hs is not be recommended it is also observed in fig 6 that regardless of the methodology there was a large spatial variability of etsafer in the center pivot area this result suggests that the methodology has the potential to be applied in precision irrigation thus each area pixel of 900 m² in the pivot would receive only the amount of evapotranspired water instead of the entire area receiving the average water depth as recommended by conventional irrigation management a variable application of irrigation depth in the pivot area meeting the water requirement of sugarcane in each subarea would ensure a higher yield and quality of the harvested product it is appropriate to note that once opting to apply the average water depth some subareas would receive a higher water depth than demanded leading to a waste of water and nutrient leaching while other subareas would receive a lower water depth than that demanded by sugarcane not adequately meeting the water requirement of the crop fig 6j shows the behaviour of the etsafer data over 3 years with an average of 2 01 mm day 1 ranging from 1 80 to 2 04 mm day 1 for the methodologies that used eto estimated by pm and 2 28 mm day 1 with eto obtained by hs the values corroborate those presented by silva et al 2018a and mahmoud and gan 2019 and are lower than those reported by carvalho et al 2015 and surendran et al 2016 as observed in fig 6 the different methodologies of eto estimation caused a direct impact on the prediction of etsafer fig 7 presents the comparison of the standard etsafer with the values of etsafer obtained with the eto estimated by alternative methodologies proposed by allen et al 1998 the values of etsafer predicted by the different methodologies showed good correlation as verified by the coefficients of determination r² 0 94 of the respective models resulting from the linear regression the f test of all regression models and the t test of all regression coefficients showed significance values lower than 0 01 and 0 1 respectively the eto values estimated by the methods with missing data of u2 and rh single or combined overestimated the etsafer with values below 0 03 mm day 1 as observed by the values of the mbe fig 7 among the eto estimation methods that used missing rs data the best performance was obtained by the one that used a combination of missing rs and u2 data underestimating etsafer by 0 14 mm day 1 all pm methods with missing rs data caused the underestimation of etsafer this result can be explained by the fact that the pm equation is highly sensitive to rs data eslamian et al 2011 gassmann2019 the eto estimated by hs led to an overestimation of 0 27 mm day 1 in etsafer indication it is not an adequate method for mapping the surface evapotranspiration in a semiarid region possibly such overestimation can be attributed to low wind speeds average u2 of 0 80 m s 1 and lower transmissivity of the atmosphere to solar radiation on the days corresponding to the dates of the images other studies have found overestimates of eto using the hs method alencar et al 2015 carvalho et al 2015 cunha et al 2017 zanetti et al 2019 for instance if irrigation was to be managed based on etsafer with the prediction of u2 and rh to estimate the eto by pm the average water surplus would be 200 l ha 1 day 1 in regard to the volume of water to be irrigated considering the hs methodology this surplus would be 2700 l ha 1 leading to a greater waste of water and energy in addition to a greater leaching of nutrients considering that safer results in an evapotranspiration fraction corresponding to the estimate the soil and crop coefficients ks and kc of the area imaged by landsat 8 the factor with the greatest impact on etsafer will be eto thus the variation in the mbe of etsafer will be directly related to the different eto values thus among the missing data in the prediction of eto the absence of rs causes the underestimation of eto as described by silva et al 2018a and alencar et al 2015 making it a better option than the use of the eto proposed by hs as described by čadro et al 2017 carvalho et al 2015 and ferreira et al 2019 the impact of estimating etsafer with different eto varies from 0 10 to 0 35 mm day 1 according to the mae values fig 7 these values are consistent with those reported by čadro et al 2017 and ferreira et al 2019 the lowest impacts on etsafer occurred when predicting the eto by pm with missing u2 and rh data mae between 0 10 and 0 14 mm day 1 followed by pm with missing rs data mae between 0 18 and 0 23 mm day 1 finally the worst values were obtained for etsafer calculated with eto estimated by hs the mae values found in the present study are lower than those reported in the literature čadro et al 2017 yang et al 2015 2019 zanetti et al 2019 the lower degree of scattering of etsafer was also observed for the etsafer calculated with the measured rs rmse between 0 21 and 0 23 mm day 1 the etsafer calculated with the eto estimated by hs showed the highest rmse 0 42 mm day 1 it is worth emphasising that although the etsafer calculated through the eto estimated by hs had lower performance than the other methodologies used the obtained metrics were higher than those reported in the literature elnmer et al 2019 ferreira2019 yang et al 2019 zanetti2019 hence if it is necessary to use eto estimated by hs for managing irrigation inserting this value into safer will have less of an impact on the estimate of surface evapotranspiration such a decision is possible because etsafer considers the actual surface conditions albedo ndvi and surface temperature thus mitigating the effects of the indirect estimation of eto by hs compared to the standard proposed by allen et al 1998 for the same reasons safer also reduces the impact of the absence of rs on the estimation of the surface the etsafer fraction can also be considered as a crop coefficient kc when the soil is close to its field capacity with constant aerodynamic and surface resistance as proposed by allen et al 1998 according to the analysis of paredes and pereira 2019 etsafer can be considered a reference for estimating surface evapotranspiration by remote sensing as it encompasses the elements of crop evapotranspiration including the eto and the usual concept of crop coefficients 4 conclusions in semiarid regions where water resources are scarce irrigation management becomes even more necessary the most widely used irrigation management is via the climate and requires surface evapotranspiration which in turn can be obtained by safer however one of the safer inputs is the reference evapotranspiration eto estimated by the penman monteith method which requires complete meteorological data thus methodologies for estimating the eto that use fewer meteorological variables should be sought mainly to increase the applicability of the method in regions without complete data among the meteorological data solar radiation is the parameter that most affected the eto and consequently the safer evapotranspiration it is expected that methodologies that disregard solar radiation in the eto calculation do not provide good performance in relation to safer evapotranspiration estimates this result can be confirmed by the poor performances of methodologies that did not use measured solar radiation data in the present study the eto obtained by the hargreaves samani method is not recommended for the calculation of the safer evapotranspiration in semiarid regions in the absence of single or combined data of wind speed and relative humidity penman monteith with missing data should be used in the estimation of eto as the input to the safer algorithm this result shows that the absence of meteorological data does not limit the use of safer to predict irrigated surface evapotranspiration in semiarid regions the present study is unprecedented but future research should be conducted considering other regions and a larger number of weather stations even so the results found in this research are promising and can serve as a basis for future studies and assist farmers and technicians in obtaining surface evapotranspiration with a high spatial and temporal resolution therefore water management of agricultural crops can be performed with free satellite imagery and limited weather data acknowledgments

10658,the simple algorithm for evapotranspiration retrieving safer can be used to estimate surface evapotranspiration in the process of safer parameterization the reference evapotranspiration eto

estimated t0 using landsat images and the planck equation for irrigated wheat crops and compared the results with in situ measurements the authors found rmse values ranging from 0 91 to 2 36 c rahimzadegan and janani 2019 and olivera guerra et al 2018 used the same procedures to calculate t0 to obtain evapotranspiration in their respective research safer evapotranspiration etsafer was calculated using eq 2 2 e t s a f e r e t e t o e t o fao56 pm where et eto is the evapotranspiration fraction and eto fao56 pm is the reference evapotranspiration eto calculated by the penman

the different methodologies were then used to calculate etsafer according to the flowchart presented in fig 3 for the area of the three center pivots cultivated with sugarcane fig 4 presents a routine that represents the sequence in which the etsafer values were extracted to evaluate the performance of the methodologies used fig 4 1 shows the map with the etsafer values of only one center pivot these values were used to create a boxplot which allowed the data to be separated into four distinct groups in fig 4 2 the grids in yellow are those that showed the etsafer values concentrated in the interquartile interval i e the 2nd and 3rd quartiles allowing the creation of the raster to create the extraction points the raster was converted to a vector fig 4 3 which was delimited by the shapefile of the pivot perimeter fig 4 4 only data from the interquartile interval were selected according to bingham 1996 and grassini et al 2014 thus clipping the area of interest fig 4 6 after clipping 20 random points were created to extract the values of etsafer fig 4 7 thus it was possible to extract all etsafer products in the same pixel considering the product obtained with the eto estimated by the pm method with complete data as a reference in the different values of the images generated fig 4 8 thus a total of 1 440 values of etsafer over three years were generated using each eto estimation methodology considering that eight eto estimation models were executed a total of 11 520 values of etsafer were generated to evaluate the performance of the methods the models were evaluated by the statistical indices of mean bias error mbe mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r² calculated by eqs 9 12 the mbe was used to indicate the tendency of models to underestimate or overestimate the etsafer values the mae was used to evaluate the accuracy of the models r2 was used to assess the precision and rmse was used to evaluate the degree of scattering of the data caused by the presence of outliers the latter justifies the elimination of data with spurious values outliers diagnosed in the boxplot čadro et al 2017 silva 2018a 9 m

etsafer with eto calculated by pm fao56 and with limited data respectively path and principal component analyses were performed to describe the influence of input parameters meteorological data on the pm model these same analyses were carried out to verify which methods studied with limited data showed greater proximity to the pm method 3 results and discussion solar radiation rs has the highest direct correlation among the input parameters in the penman monteith pm equation to estimate reference evapotranspiration eto as verified in the path analysis shown in fig 5 b this same result was observed in principal component analysis fig 5a in principal component analysis fig 5a the methodologies for estimating eto that used missing data of wind speed u2 and relative humidity rh either single or combined showed higher correlations with the eto values estimated by pm with complete data it is worth noting that the methodologies that used missing data of u2 and rh were also those that used measured data of rs these results showed that rs contributed a greater proportion to the eto estimation than did the aerodynamic factors corroborating gassmann et al 2019 thus the result demonstrates the importance of accurately measuring or estimating rs to ensure the adequate estimation of eto corroborating mokhtari et al 2018 and paredes and pereira 2019 the proposed method by pm with missing data has better performance when rs is measured and the other parameters are estimated thus predicting meteorological information to estimate eto by pm as observed in fig 5 has better performance than other models such as hs for the estimation of eto this result corroborates those found in other studies such as those conducted by silva et al 2018a and singh rawat et al 2019 in semiarid regions and by ferreira et al 2019 in different climatic regions the eto values estimated by the different methodologies had a visible impact on the estimated values of etsafer as shown in fig 6 the behaviour observed in the multivariate analysis fig 5 is also verified in the mapping of etsafer fig 6 the values of etsafer calculated with the eto estimated by pm with complete data standard etsafer figure 6a showed behaviour similar to that of the etsafer values obtained with eto estimated with missing data of u2 and rh fig 6b c and f on the other hand the etsafer estimation was hampered in the methodologies that did not use measured rs fig 6d e g and i the etsafer obtained with the eto estimated by the hargreaves samani method fig 5i showed much higher values than those of standard etsafer these results suggest higher water demand by sugarcane and higher water consumption thus the methodology for obtaining etsafer through the eto estimated by hs is not be recommended it is also observed in fig 6 that regardless of the methodology there was a large spatial variability of etsafer in the center pivot area this result suggests that the methodology has the potential to be applied in precision irrigation thus each area pixel of 900 m² in the pivot would receive only the amount of evapotranspired water instead of the entire area receiving the average water depth as recommended by conventional irrigation management a variable application of irrigation depth in the pivot area meeting the water requirement of sugarcane in each subarea would ensure a higher yield and quality of the harvested product it is appropriate to note that once opting to apply the average water depth some subareas would receive a higher water depth than demanded leading to a waste of water and nutrient leaching while other subareas would receive a lower water depth than that demanded by sugarcane not adequately meeting the water requirement of the crop fig 6j shows the behaviour of the etsafer data over 3 years with an average of 2 01 mm day 1 ranging from 1 80 to 2 04 mm day 1 for the methodologies that used eto estimated by pm and 2 28 mm day 1 with eto obtained by hs the values corroborate those presented by silva et al 2018a and mahmoud and gan 2019 and are lower than those reported by carvalho et al 2015 and surendran et al 2016 as observed in fig 6 the different methodologies of eto estimation caused a direct impact on the prediction of etsafer fig 7 presents the comparison of the standard etsafer with the values of etsafer obtained with the eto estimated by alternative methodologies proposed by allen et al 1998 the values of etsafer predicted by the different methodologies showed good correlation as verified by the coefficients of determination r² 0 94 of the respective models resulting from the linear regression the f test of all regression models and the t test of all regression coefficients showed significance values lower than 0 01 and 0 1 respectively the eto values estimated by the methods with missing data of u2 and rh single or combined overestimated the etsafer with values below 0 03 mm day 1 as observed by the values of the mbe fig 7 among the eto estimation methods that used missing rs data the best performance was obtained by the one that used a combination of missing rs and u2 data underestimating etsafer by 0 14 mm day 1 all pm methods with missing rs data caused the underestimation of etsafer this result can be explained by the fact that the pm equation is highly sensitive to rs data eslamian et al 2011 gassmann2019 the eto estimated by hs led to an overestimation of 0 27 mm day 1 in etsafer indication it is not an adequate method for mapping the surface evapotranspiration in a semiarid region possibly such overestimation can be attributed to low wind speeds average u2 of 0 80 m s 1 and lower transmissivity of the atmosphere to solar radiation on the days corresponding to the dates of the images other studies have found overestimates of eto using the hs method alencar et al 2015 carvalho et al 2015 cunha et al 2017 zanetti et al 2019 for instance if irrigation was to be managed based on etsafer with the prediction of u2 and rh to estimate the eto by pm the average water surplus would be 200 l ha 1 day 1 in regard to the volume of water to be irrigated considering the hs methodology this surplus would be 2700 l ha 1 leading to a greater waste of water and energy in addition to a greater leaching of nutrients considering that safer results in an evapotranspiration fraction corresponding to the estimate the soil and crop coefficients ks and kc of the area imaged by landsat 8 the factor with the greatest impact on etsafer will be eto thus the variation in the mbe of etsafer will be directly related to the different eto values thus among the missing data in the prediction of eto the absence of rs causes the underestimation of eto as described by silva et al 2018a and alencar et al 2015 making it a better option than the use of the eto proposed by hs as described by čadro et al 2017 carvalho et al 2015 and ferreira et al 2019 the impact of estimating etsafer with different eto varies from 0 10 to 0 35 mm day 1 according to the mae values fig 7 these values are consistent with those reported by čadro et al 2017 and ferreira et al 2019 the lowest impacts on etsafer occurred when predicting the eto by pm with missing u2 and rh data mae between 0 10 and 0 14 mm day 1 followed by pm with missing rs data mae between 0 18 and 0 23 mm day 1 finally the worst values were obtained for etsafer calculated with eto estimated by hs the mae values found in the present study are lower than those reported in the literature čadro et al 2017 yang et al 2015 2019 zanetti et al 2019 the lower degree of scattering of etsafer was also observed for the etsafer calculated with the measured rs rmse between 0 21 and 0 23 mm day 1 the etsafer calculated with the eto estimated by hs showed the highest rmse 0 42 mm day 1 it is worth emphasising that although the etsafer calculated through the eto estimated by hs had lower performance than the other methodologies used the obtained metrics were higher than those reported in the literature elnmer et al 2019 ferreira2019 yang et al 2019 zanetti2019 hence if it is necessary to use eto estimated by hs for managing irrigation inserting this value into safer will have less of an impact on the estimate of surface evapotranspiration such a decision is possible because etsafer considers the actual surface conditions albedo ndvi and surface temperature thus mitigating the effects of the indirect estimation of eto by hs compared to the standard proposed by allen et al 1998 for the same reasons safer also reduces the impact of the absence of rs on the estimation of the surface the etsafer fraction can also be considered as a crop coefficient kc when the soil is close to its field capacity with constant aerodynamic and surface resistance as proposed by allen et al 1998 according to the analysis of paredes and pereira 2019 etsafer can be considered a reference for estimating surface evapotranspiration by remote sensing as it encompasses the elements of crop evapotranspiration including the eto and the usual concept of crop coefficients 4 conclusions in semiarid regions where water resources are scarce irrigation management becomes even more necessary the most widely used irrigation management is via the climate and requires surface evapotranspiration which in turn can be obtained by safer however one of the safer inputs is the reference evapotranspiration eto estimated by the penman monteith method which requires complete meteorological data thus methodologies for estimating the eto that use fewer meteorological variables should be sought mainly to increase the applicability of the method in regions without complete data among the meteorological data solar radiation is the parameter that most affected the eto and consequently the safer evapotranspiration it is expected that methodologies that disregard solar radiation in the eto calculation do not provide good performance in relation to safer evapotranspiration estimates this result can be confirmed by the poor performances of methodologies that did not use measured solar radiation data in the present study the eto obtained by the hargreaves samani method is not recommended for the calculation of the safer evapotranspiration in semiarid regions in the absence of single or combined data of wind speed and relative humidity penman monteith with missing data should be used in the estimation of eto as the input to the safer algorithm this result shows that the absence of meteorological data does not limit the use of safer to predict irrigated surface evapotranspiration in semiarid regions the present study is unprecedented but future research should be conducted considering other regions and a larger number of weather stations even so the results found in this research are promising and can serve as a basis for future studies and assist farmers and technicians in obtaining surface evapotranspiration with a high spatial and temporal resolution therefore water management of agricultural crops can be performed with free satellite imagery and limited weather data acknowledgments

10659,recent investigations have shown the potential of a water balance method based on normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data to estimate actual evapotranspiration eta of mediterranean grasslands and croplands the method uses the fractional vegetation cover fvc derived from ndvi to separately estimate vegetation transpiration and bare soil evaporation which are limited by short term meteorological water stress scalars the current paper proposes a modification of these scalars to address the occurrence of water supply additional to rainfall i e irrigated condition the modified method utilises the temporal evolution of fvc since the beginning of the water stress period to infer the occurrence of irrigation and consequently modify the water scalars the new method is tested in two study areas in tuscany central italy where meadows and annual crops are grown in both rainfed and irrigated conditions the high spatial fragmentation of these areas is addressed by the use of imagery taken by the recently launched sentinel 2 multispectral instrument msi which allows the identification of all main seasonal ndvi evolutions the tests firstly demonstrate the null or marginal impact of the modification in rainfed condition secondly the effect of the modified water stress scalars is evaluated for irrigated grasses and crops the latter case includes two experiments in which the original and modified eta estimates are assessed against relevant ground observations obtained by the processing of meteorological and soil water content datasets the experimental results indicate that the new method is capable of correctly identifying the occurrence of irrigation and consequently improves the eta estimation accuracy for irrigated grasses and crops in particular the modified method accounts for about 90 of the seasonal eta variance observed in the irrigated meadow and tomato field keywords sentinel 2 fractional vegetation cover fvc water stress irrigation 1 introduction evapotranspiration which is the sum of evaporation from bare land and transpiration from vegetation is a major term of the terrestrial water cycle whose knowledge is essential for both scientific and practical reasons zhan et al 2019 from an operational point of view two quantities are commonly utilized one of which potential evapotranspiration et0 is the reference process from a fully watered surface and the other actual evapotranspiration eta refers to real surface condition thornthwaite 1948 senay 2008 and is directly related to other major eco physiological processes i e photosynthesis the methods used to quantify et0 are generally based on the characterization of local meteorology i e measurements of solar radiation air temperature wind and relative humidity numerous techniques can also be applied to estimate eta in the field depending on the investigation scale i e lysimeter eddy covariance technique and on the basic principle applied e g water balance or energy balance methods eta is however more difficult to quantify than et0 because it is extremely variable in space and time depending on major environmental factors i e besides meteorology site terrain soil and vegetation features etc and particularly on soil water availability consequently in semi arid regions eta can be much lower than et0 due to soil water shortage this can be particularly the case for mediterranean areas which are characterised by a rainfall distribution mostly concentrated in autumn and spring leading to prolonged and intense droughts during the hottest summer months additionally the mediterranean climate is conditioned by intra and inter annual rainfall variability which notably affects the development of local vegetation rana and katerji 2000 anderson et al 2012 all these factors joint to the human pressure exerted on these environments since ancient times lead to a great spatio temporal heterogeneity of the vegetation cover scarascia mugnozza et al 2000 as a consequence most mediterranean landscapes are spatially fragmented and covered by vegetation types having diversified growing cycles which complicates the application of common monitoring eta methods particularly for operational purposes rana and katerji 2000 these difficulties are often overcome through the application of the fao semi empirical approach based on the crop coefficient kc concept allen et al 1998 the applicability of this approach originally limited to fully watered ecosystems has been extended to the other cases by the use of soil water content swc measurements which take into account the effect of water stress allen et al 2005 the eta estimates obtained in this way however are referred to the homogeneous areas for which the swc observations can be considered to be representative whose size is extremely variable and may be very small in spatially fragmented landscapes chiesi et al 2018 remote sensing techniques are therefore the most promising for eta estimation over wide areas due to their capacity to offer a synchronous view of large land surfaces over different temporal scales see zhang et al 2016 for a review the approaches commonly utilised to estimate eta through these techniques are still based on two main principles i e on the energy balance and the water balance the first approach utilises the difference between air and land surface temperatures the latter derived from thermal infrared imagery having proper spatial and temporal characteristics glenn et al 2010 olivera guerra et al 2017 this approach however generally suffers from problems of undersampling in space and time due to the high variability of land surface temperature which can hardly be detected by currently available satellite sensors in alternative water balance methods utilize remotely sensed vegetation indices to quantify the more temporally stable biomass amount that would be transpiring in well watered conditions allen et al 2005 mahmoud and gan 2019 the use of vegetation indices to estimate the fractional vegetation cover and related crop coefficients was recently reviewed by senay et al 2015 whilst escarabajal henarejos et al 2015 pursued the same objective based on digital photographs maselli et al 2014 proposed an advancement of this approach i e the ndvi cws method suitable for estimating daily eta in water limited environments the method uses ndvi to separate evaporating and transpiring land surfaces and incorporates meteorological scalars which take into account short term water stress these scalars are obtained from the combination of local precipitation and et0 observations under the assumption that rainfall is the unique water source for the examined ecosystem while this assumption generally holds for rainfed grasslands it is clearly inadequate for grasses which are fed by other water sources adjacent ponds or streams water table etc and particularly for crops grown during the dry season which are usually irrigated to address these cases the ndvi cws method must therefore be modified which is the subject of the current investigation more specifically this investigation aims at developing and testing a method to modify the original water stress scalars accounting for water supply additional to rainfall in particular irrigation the following section introduces the conceptual basis of the original and modified ndvi cws method secondly the two versions of the method are tested in two areas covered by rainfed and irrigated herbaceous ecosystems in particular the two study sites are covered by vegetation types which are representative of typical mediterranean grasslands and croplands the results obtained are finally discussed and commented in the two conclusive sections 2 methodological framework 2 1 ndvi cws eta estimation method the ndvi cws method combines conventional meteorological observations i e air temperature precipitation and solar radiation and satellite ndvi images to produce daily eta estimates maselli et al 2014 the theoretical basis of the method implies the separation between transpiration and evaporation processes and their reduction in response to water stress the method distinguishes between a reversible status strain phase during which plants affected by water stress tend to reduce transpiration and a permanent damage phase induced by long lasting water shortage which leads to a reduction in green biomass and ndvi accordingly two short term water stress factors are considered which reduce transpiration to half of its potential and evaporation to zero see maselli et al 2014 for details these scalars are derived from a simplified site water balance as the ratio between rainfall and et0 both cumulated over relatively short time periods few weeks such accumulation integrates the occasional water inputs rainfalls and the continuous outputs et0 so as to reproduce the soil water content dynamic which regulates transient eta reduction mechanisms maselli et al 2009 west et al 2019 computationally the fractional vegetation cover fvc is utilised to account for the contribution of transpiration and evaporation obtaining daily eta by means of the following equations 1 eta et0 fvc kcveg cws 1 fvc kcsoil aw where cws and aw are the two short term water stress scalars for transpiration and evaporation and kcveg and kcsoil correspond to the maximum crop coefficients for vegetation and soil respectively 1 2 and 0 2 for grasslands all referred to the study day fvc is derived from ndvi through the generalised linear equation proposed by gutman and ignatov 1998 which is applicable to atmospherically corrected ndvi imagery cws and aw are instead obtained by combining conventional meteorological data i e daily rainfall and et0 observations through the following equations 2 aw rain et0 where both rain and et0 are cumulated over one month for grasses and aw is constrained to 1 cws is derived from aw as 3 cws 0 5 0 5 aw the ndvi cws method has been successfully tested for various types of rainfed mediterranean ecosystems such as coniferous and deciduous forests grasslands and olive groves maselli et al 2014 battista et al 2016 chiesi et al 2019 when applied to annual grasses and crops the original method accounts for possible water sources alternative to rainfall mainly irrigation by deactivating the two water stress scalars when ndvi exceeds a certain threshold 0 6 during the summer dry season this approach usually provides reasonable results over relatively large areas but is clearly suboptimal when applied to specific fields thus the ndvi cws method must be modified for extending its applicability to any type of herbaceous ecosystem which may be fed by water supply additional to rainfall particularly annual grasses and crops this objective can be pursued relying on the following considerations i herbaceous vegetation has generally a limited capacity to use the water stored in deep soil layers grasslands are therefore readily responsive to water deficit maselli et al 2012 ii in particular annual grasses and crops grown in rainfed condition having a brief growing cycle few months and poorly developed rooting systems tend to respond rapidly to the soil water shortage which is induced by persistent meteorological water stress pereira et al 2007 west et al 2019 iii more precisely the reversible response of annual grasses and crops to soil water shortage strain phase is almost immediate while the green biomass reduction damage phase occurs after a certain period 1 2 weeks of water stress iv consequently increasing or stable grass crop fvc after this period can be supposed to indicate the occurrence of water supply additional to rainfall in contrast an fvc decrease which progresses during the water stress period indicates no or limited additional water supply v temporal fvc variations during the dry period can therefore be taken as indicative of the water really supplied to annual grasses or crops according to this conceptual framework the annual maximum development of rainfed herbaceous ecosystems should be reached before severe water limitation i e around the beginning of the water stress season ozdogan and gutman 2008 maselli et al 2014 an fvc increment after this period may therefore be considered as indicative of additional water supply and used to modify the original water stress scalars aw and cws this is performed by defining a normalized fvc fvcnorm which starting from the beginning of the dry period tends to 0 when fvc decreases while approaches 1 when fvc increases or remains close to the progressive maximum 4 fvcnorm fvc fvcmin fvcmax fvcmin where fvcmin and fvcmax are found progressively since the beginning of the water stress season i e when aw becomes lower than 1 next this new index is combined with the original aw through 5 awfvc max aw fvcnorm which reduces the impact of water limitation i e increases aw up to 1 when fvc approaches the progressive maximum while is virtually not influential i e tends to the original aw when fvc is close to the progressive minimum finally awfvc is used together with the corresponding modified cws eq 3 to drive a modified version of eq 1 which can be applied during the period of possible irrigation as can be easily understood this awfvc computation algorithm is more sensitive to temporal fvc ndvi variations than to absolute fvc values from an eco physiological viewpoint this functioning accounts for the possible variability in fvc response to environmental factors whose theoretical basis and implications will be examined in the discussion section simultaneously the algorithm minimizes the redundancy of awfvc with fvc in eq 1 which could negatively affect the prediction of eta the functioning of the awfvc computation algorithm is exemplified in fig 1 a c fig 1a shows an annual meteorological evolution typical of the mediterranean climate rainfalls are relatively abundant in spring and scarce in summer in coincidence with the maximum plant water requirement this determines a water stress period from may to september which is clearly visible in the seasonal evolution of the meteorological water stress scalar aw fig 1b the growth of a typical rainfed crop follows this meteorological pattern having an ndvi maximum in late spring and a relative minimum in summer this leads to a clear summer minimum of eta predicted by eq 1 which is consequent on the decrease of both the original water stress scalars and of ndvi the same ndvi evolution leaves awfvc unaltered with respect to the original aw and consequently does not change the eta predicted using the modified scalars the case is different for a summer crop fig 1c whose growth during the dry period indicated by an ndvi rise can be sustained only by artificial water supply irrigation consequently the ndvi rise after the start of the dry season leads to a prompt modification of awfvc i e to a full or partial deactivation of the water stress scalars in july august this induces a notable increase in the eta predicted using awfvc in place of aw which correctly accounts for the null or reduced impact of short term water stress on irrigated vegetation the water stress scalars can be deactivated in any period of the dry season depending on the timing and duration of the crop growing cycle and on the consequent ndvi evolution for example awfvc values close to 1 can occur from the start of the dry season to august or from july to the end of the season in cases of early or late summer crops respectively in all cases the temporal resolution of the modified scalars is constrained by the available ndvi imagery i e it depends on the frequency of actually usable ndvi observations the proposed modification should obviously be active only in cases of water supply additional to rainfall specifically irrigation thus in each case study a test is first made to ascertain that the original water stress scalars are modified only marginally in rainfed condition secondly another test is conducted to evaluate the effect of the modification under irrigated condition particularly for the estimation of eta 3 case studies 3 1 study areas and data 3 1 1 pescia the first study site is located in an experimental area of the crea research centre for

information was derived from a regional soil database complemented with the results of crop simulations driven by the regional agrometeorological service see http agroambiente info arsia toscana it specific ground observations were instead collected for the tomato field during the same growing season tomato plants were transplanted on 28th april and fruits were harvested on the 31st july drip

weather data i e air temperature air humidity precipitation solar radiation wind speed and direction which were aggregated on a daily basis interpolated daily weather data for the entire 2018 were derived as before from the regional database swc was measured by means of 10hs decagon sensors placed at 0 15 and 0 30 m soil depth in correspondence of five sampling points water supply was measured by means of a litre counter field surveys were also carried out during the main tomato growing phases to monitor the development of plants in terms of fractional vegetation cover all sentinel 2 msi images available for 2018 were freely downloaded in a pre processed l2a format also for this study area 3 2 data processing the data processing consisted of several steps most of which are fully described in the cited references the entire procedure was repeated for each study site using the available ground and satellite datasets firstly the interpolated meteorological data of each site were combined to compute et0 aw and cws as reported in maselli et al 2014 secondly the available sentinel 2 images were preprocessed in order to obtain 15 day ndvi maximum value composites mvc minimally affected by atmospheric disturbances maselli et al 2020 mean ndvi values were then extracted from the 10 m pixels corresponding to the study meadows or fields more precisely two and four pixels were considered for the small irrigated and rainfed meadows of pescia respectively at least 10 pixels were instead considered for the relatively large fields of roselle table 1 ndvi was converted into fvc linearly interpolated to daily values and smoothed by a temporal filtering maselli et al 2020 next the weather and satellite data of each site were used to drive eq 1 where aw and cws were computed by means of eq s 2 3 the operation was repeated using the modified water stress scalars computed by eq s 4 5 which were applied from mid may to mid october the results obtained in these experiments were first visually examined the effect of the methodological modification in two of the irrigated cases meadow of pescia and tomato field of roselle was then quantitatively assessed by comparing the different eta estimates to ground eta observations the latter were produced by applying a variant of the classical fao crop coefficient kc approach to the weather irrigation and swc measurements collected in situ allen et al 2005 the method combines daily et0 with time varying kc defined as the ratio of the eta observable for a fully watered crop over et0 possible water limitation is accounted for through the use of a water stress coefficient ks the daily eta of any ecosystem can therefore be obtained as 6 eta et0 kc ks where kc is the temporally variable crop coefficient which is strictly dependent on the characteristics of the plants considered and ks is the water stress coefficient both referred to each study day allen et al 2005 the kc of the pescia meadow was set to a constant value of 1 while that of the roselle tomato field varied between 0 26 1 1 as fully described in maselli et al 2020 ks was instead obtained combining the available ground observations as reported in chiesi et al 2018 the results of the final comparison between the ground eta observations and the respective estimates were summarized by means of common accuracy statistics r2 rmse and mbe 3 3 results 3 3 1 pescia the meteorology of the first study site pescia during 2018 is typical of the mediterranean climate fig 3 rainfall is relatively abundant till mid may and almost null in summer while et0 reaches its maximum just after the summer solstice the combination of these patterns induces a marked dry period from the beginning of june to the end of september which is clearly reflected in the evolution of the original water stress scalar aw during the growing season i e in the period 1st april 31st october 2018 fig 4 a water stress is evident till the end of september and completely vanishes after about one month fig 4b shows the fvc evolution of the pescia rainfed meadow meadow 1 during the same period fvc reaches a maximum at the end of april 0 65 and then steadily decreases till the end of august due to this trend awfvc is modified only marginally with respect to the original scalar fig 4a this obviously implies a very small and insignificant difference of the ndvi cws eta estimates obtained using the original and modified scalars below 1 data not shown the case is completely different for the other meadow meadow 2 whose fvc is regularly increasing from may to october consequent on the continuous irrigation since the beginning of june this induces a clear modification of awfvc fig 4a which remains constantly close to 1 for the whole irrigation period i e from the beginning of june to mid october the evolution of the ground eta obtained by equation 6 is shown in fig 5 due to the irrigation water supply ks remains always higher than 0 8 so that eta is almost insensitive to water stress and closely follows et0 for the whole year the total annual value is about 630 mm with daily peaks of 5 mm close to the solstice the use of the ndvi cws method driven by the original water stress scalars causes a clear drop of estimated eta since the beginning of june fig 5 consequently the eta obtained using these scalars is highly underestimated mbe 0 92 mm the accuracy of the estimates is highly improved when utilising the modified scalars which nullify the effect of water stress r2 increases from 0 446 to 0 877 rmse decreases from 1 26 to 0 50 mm and mbe is reduced to 0 24 mm 3 3 2 roselle the meteorology of the roselle site during 2018 is typical for the semi arid plain around the town of grosseto fig 6 rainfall is concentrated in spring and autumn with a minimum during the hottest summer season this seasonal pattern is reflected into the annual evolution of the meteorological water stress scalar aw which is shown in fig 7 a no water stress is detected until the beginning of june next there is a first aw decrease followed by a slight recovery after some rainfalls around the middle of june water becomes strongly limiting during the driest summer period being aw low up to october when abundant rainfalls occur fig 7b shows the evolution of fvc for two rainfed fields one grown with wheat and the other with chickpea table 2 the wheat evolution is typical of mediterranean winter crops i e has a peak in april followed by a steep decrease which is partly consequent on harvest in june a slight recovery is then visible in autumn when rainfalls feed the re growth of semi natural grasses the fvc evolution of chickpea which is a spring crop more resistant to aridity is characterised by a later development followed by a decrease in july both evolutions induce null or only marginal modifications in the original water stress scalars a slight difference is only visible for the wheat field due to the fall vegetation recovery as for the rainfed site of pescia the difference brought for eta estimation when using the new versus the original scalars is marginal still below 1 data not shown fig 8 a shows the same water stress scalars for the two irrigated fields grown with the early and late corn varieties described in table 2 the growing cycle of both crops is about 120 days and can be clearly characterised by their fvc evolution the former field i e corn early shows a maximum fvc development around mid june followed by a slight decrease till the end of august and a clear drop after harvest fig 8b this evolution is reflected into that of awfvc which has a maximum during the fvc increase next awfvc diminishes following a slight fvc decrease in the second half of august an abrupt decrease in awfvc occurs as a consequence of the green biomass reduction and the two factors become again coincident at the beginning of september in the case of the corn late field the evolution of fvc shows two diversified peaks the first occurs in early spring before the beginning of the dry season and is due to the presence of ryegrass which is grown in rainfed condition before the corn growing cycle from the end of june to the beginning of october this is reflected into the awfvc evolution of fig 8a which follows the original scalar till the end of june next corn begins to grow and awfvc approaches 1 the maximum awfvc value is maintained up to the fvc reduction after harvest beginning of october when fvc decreases and the two scalars become again coincident the last crop analyzed is the early variety of tomato which was fully characterised by ground observations in this case tomato is transplanted at the end of april and the growing cycle lasts about 90 days table 2 and fig 9 fvc shows a sudden increase after transplanting up to about 0 78 at the end of june then it slightly decreases and drops at the end of july following this trend awfvc remains close to 1 till the beginning of july and returns coincident with the original scalar at the beginning of august fig 10 shows the assessment of the daily eta estimated using the original and modified water stress scalars against ground data the ground eta is available only for the growing cycle of tomato i e from the end of april to the end of july when meteorological irrigation and swc measurements were collected also in this case ks remains constantly high 0 8 from the middle of june to the end of july due to the water supplied by irrigation the amount of water lost during the crop growing cycle is about 370 mm with a maximum daily peak around 10 mm which corresponds to the maximum crop development the use of the original water stress scalars is not capable of reproducing the ground eta pattern when irrigation occurs i e after mid june leading to a strong underestimation of eta the use of awfvc corrects this underestimation improving all accuracy statistics r2 increases from 0 814 to 0 933 while rmse and mbe decrease from 1 73 to 0 57 mm and from 1 33 to 0 19 mm respectively 4 discussion remote sensing eta estimation methods based on the energy balance approach derive information about actual land conditions from thermal infrared imagery this imagery is promptly responsive to the actual water status of soil and above all vegetation due to the immediate reduction of surface temperature caused by both evaporation and transpiration processes van eekelen et al 2015 as previously mentioned however thermal infrared imagery suffers from undersampling issues due to the insufficient spatio temporal details provided by existing satellite systems water balance eta estimation methods which utilize ndvi or other vegetation indices as indicative of green biomass amount are more temporally stable and therefore less subjected to the mentioned undersampling issues this is particularly the case after the recent launch of the sentinel 2 satellite mission which routinely provides frequent high spatial resolution ndvi images in their basic form however water balance methods are applicable only to well watered crops since green biomass amount and vis are not immediately responsive to transient water stress which is mostly reflected into reversible eco physiological adaptations i e stomata closure and other mechanisms which increase plant resistance to water loss maselli et al 2009 joiner et al 2018 the ndvi cws method overcomes this problem by utilising two short term water stress scalars derived from standard meteorological datasets i e temperature rainfall and radiation observations the method is consequently suboptimal when water can be provided by other sources and particularly by irrigation whose occurrence is generally irregular and difficult to assess over large agricultural areas to cope with these cases which are common in semi arid mediterranean areas a modification has been proposed that is theoretically based on identifying a divergence in the seasonal evolution of meteorological water stress and ndvi in particular the new method relies on the working hypothesis that following persistent meteorological water stress the ndvi of annual crops should tend to decrease in the absence of water sources alternative to rainfall this hypothesis is actually supported by both theoretical considerations and experimental observations which have demonstrated that grass ndvi is sensitive to intense soil water shortage herbaceous vegetation in fact reacts to a few days of water depletion in the rooting zone with leaf wilting and yellowing and consequent ndvi decrease joiner et al 2018 as previously noted this is particularly the case for annual grasses which having more limited rooting systems are more rapidly responsive to soil water shortage pereira et al 2007 these considerations provide the rationale for using the temporal ndvi variation at a scale of 10 15 days which is that observable from the used mvc images to predict the actual impact of meteorological water stress on annual crops when an ndvi fvc decrease does not occur after the beginning of the dry period water supply additional to rainfall can be plausibly supposed with consequent modification of the water stress scalars used to feed the ndvi cws method while the most obvious solution to modify the water stress scalars would be based on a temporal derivative of fvc the function currently chosen consists of a progressive normalization operation which more thoroughly exploits the seasonal fvc evolution since the beginning of the water stress period this operation makes fvcnorm equal 0 when fvc is decreasing 1 when fvc is increasing and intermediate values when fvc is between the dry season minimum and maximum after composing this index with aw the original water stress scalars are modified only when fvc is increasing or close to the seasonal maximum while are practically unaltered when fvc decreases this modification strategy is effective up to the end of the dry season i e when aw 1 after which both aw and fvcnorm usually recover as a consequence of autumn rainfalls the same strategy implies that the magnitude of fvc is poorly influential on the modified water stress scalars the progressive normalization operation made through eq 4 in fact is functionally similar to an fvc derivative in time which deactivates the meteorological scalars when a rise or relatively high value of fvc is detected during the water stress period the effect of the modification is therefore given by the temporal fvc variation since the beginning of the dry period so that the modified scalars are mostly independent of absolute fvc values for example intermediate but increasing fvc in water stress condition will deactivate the scalars producing moderate eta estimates while higher but decreasing fvc will activate the scalars and produce lower eta estimates this possible uncoupling between fvc and awfvc is a distinctive feature of the modified ndvi cws method which accounts for the variable dependence of ndvi fvc on water availability remote sensing vegetation indices in fact are indicative of green biomass whose response to water stress is affected by numerous factors such as vegetation type soil features management practices etc in all rainfed cases however the green biomass and thus the fvc of annual grasses and crops can be expected to decrease in response to lasting meteorological water stress while a rising or steadily high fvc can be assumed to be indicative of water supply additional to rainfall which for croplands usually corresponds to irrigation agricultural activities add to this scheme modifying the crop growing cycles but leaving mostly unaltered the general functioning of the method at least in the examined mediterranean context winter and spring crops such as wheat are usually harvested before the period of intense water stress the corresponding fvc decrease leads to a correct identification of non irrigated condition early summer crops are sowed or transplanted in mid spring the marked fvc rise around the beginning of the water stress period indicates the immediate occurrence of irrigation which lasts until the fvc drop at the end of the growing cycle july august finally late summer crops which may be preceded by other crops as ryegrass or alfalfa are planted in late spring no irrigation is detected during the possible fvc decrease of the first crop growing cycle while additional water supply is predicted from the following fvc rise to the fvc drop at end of the growing season september october this theoretical framework is supported by the experimental results obtained in two study areas covered by rainfed and irrigated mediterranean herbaceous ecosystems the new method produces no modification of the original water stress scalars in rainfed condition when fvc naturally tends to decrease after the spring peak the same method instead reduces water limitation when fvc increases or is close to the seasonal maximum during the dry season which is indicative of well watered and presumably irrigated condition the assessment of the ndvi cws eta estimates versus ground observations confirms that in the latter case the original water stress scalars are clearly inadequate producing a strong eta underestimation during the irrigation period this underestimation is almost completely corrected by the new scalars which can produce accurate eta estimates for both sites examined irrigation is the primary water source for grasses and crops during the summer dry period but other sources additional to rainfall can also exist such as adjacent ponds streams canals shallow water table etc exploring the efficiency of the modified ndvi cws method in these cases would require the collection and analysis of additional representative datasets which is beyond the scope of the current investigation it can be hypothesized however that the water supply from most of these sources would postpone the spring ndvi peak and increase the following ndvi values depending on the intensity and timing of the phenomenon these ndvi increments would modify the water stress scalars to different extents and durations anyway reducing the transient impact of water limitation for example the presence of spring ponds in a grassland should induce an ndvi peak delayed with respect to beginning of the water stress period which would make awfvc approach 1 for the subsequent days weeks followed by a decrement slower than that of the original aw 5 conclusions the current paper proposes a modification of the ndvi cws method which was envisaged for predicting eta in water limited mediterranean regions recent works have shown that this method can be effectively applied to spatially fragmented agricultural areas gaining profit from the enhanced spatial and temporal properties of sentinel 2 ndvi imagery maselli et al 2020 the original method however is based on the use of meteorological water stress scalars which cannot directly account for water supply additional to rainfall i e irrigated condition the modification currently proposed addresses this issue relying on an eco physiological logic whose validity has been assessed in two experimental cases the results of these experiments demonstrate that the modified ndvi cws method is suitable for predicting the eta of annual grasses and crops which can be irrigated during the summer dry season consequently the method could be implemented for the operational monitoring of croplands in mediterranean regions in sight of this implementation further tests should be conducted to assess the performance of the method at various spatial resolutions and in different eco climatic conditions the operational monitoring of cropland eta could be particularly rewarding for assessing the water resources used for irrigation at regional and sub regional scales the knowledge of these resources is in fact of primary importance for regulating conflicts among different water uses i e for civil industrial and agricultural purposes which is a rising issue in many regions of the globe as a consequence of both

10659,recent investigations have shown the potential of a water balance method based on normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data to estimate actual evapotranspiration eta of mediterranean grasslands and croplands the method uses the fractional vegetation cover fvc derived from ndvi to separately estimate vegetation transpiration and bare soil evaporation which are limited by short term meteorological water stress scalars the current paper proposes a modification of these scalars to address the occurrence of water supply additional to rainfall i e irrigated condition the modified method utilises the temporal evolution of fvc since the beginning of the water stress period to infer the occurrence of irrigation and consequently modify the water scalars the new method is tested in two study areas in tuscany central italy where meadows and annual crops are grown in both rainfed and irrigated conditions the high spatial fragmentation of these areas is addressed by the use of imagery taken by the recently launched sentinel 2 multispectral instrument msi which allows the identification of all main seasonal ndvi evolutions the tests firstly demonstrate the null or marginal impact of the modification in rainfed condition secondly the effect of the modified water stress scalars is evaluated for irrigated grasses and crops the latter case includes two experiments in which the original and modified eta estimates are assessed against relevant ground observations obtained by the processing of meteorological and soil water content datasets the experimental results indicate that the new method is capable of correctly identifying the occurrence of irrigation and consequently improves the eta estimation accuracy for irrigated grasses and crops in particular the modified method accounts for about 90 of the seasonal eta variance observed in the irrigated meadow and tomato field keywords sentinel 2 fractional vegetation cover fvc water stress irrigation 1 introduction evapotranspiration which is the sum of evaporation from bare land and transpiration from vegetation is a major term of the terrestrial water cycle whose knowledge is essential for both scientific and practical reasons zhan et al 2019 from an operational point of view two quantities are commonly utilized one of which potential evapotranspiration et0 is the reference process from a fully watered surface and the other actual evapotranspiration eta refers to real surface condition thornthwaite 1948 senay 2008 and is directly related to other major eco physiological processes i e photosynthesis the methods used to quantify et0 are generally based on the characterization of local meteorology i e measurements of solar radiation air temperature wind and relative humidity numerous techniques can also be applied to estimate eta in the field depending on the investigation scale i e lysimeter eddy covariance technique and on the basic principle applied e g water balance or energy balance methods eta is however more difficult to quantify than et0 because it is extremely variable in space and time depending on major environmental factors i e besides meteorology site terrain soil and vegetation features etc and particularly on soil water availability consequently in semi arid regions eta can be much lower than et0 due to soil water shortage this can be particularly the case for mediterranean areas which are characterised by a rainfall distribution mostly concentrated in autumn and spring leading to prolonged and intense droughts during the hottest summer months additionally the mediterranean climate is conditioned by intra and inter annual rainfall variability which notably affects the development of local vegetation rana and katerji 2000 anderson et al 2012 all these factors joint to the human pressure exerted on these environments since ancient times lead to a great spatio temporal heterogeneity of the vegetation cover scarascia mugnozza et al 2000 as a consequence most mediterranean landscapes are spatially fragmented and covered by vegetation types having diversified growing cycles which complicates the application of common monitoring eta methods particularly for operational purposes rana and katerji 2000 these difficulties are often overcome through the application of the fao semi empirical approach based on the crop coefficient kc concept allen et al 1998 the applicability of this approach originally limited to fully watered ecosystems has been extended to the other cases by the use of soil water content swc measurements which take into account the effect of water stress allen et al 2005 the eta estimates obtained in this way however are referred to the homogeneous areas for which the swc observations can be considered to be representative whose size is extremely variable and may be very small in spatially fragmented landscapes chiesi et al 2018 remote sensing techniques are therefore the most promising for eta estimation over wide areas due to their capacity to offer a synchronous view of large land surfaces over different temporal scales see zhang et al 2016 for a review the approaches commonly utilised to estimate eta through these techniques are still based on two main principles i e on the energy balance and the water balance the first approach utilises the difference between air and land surface temperatures the latter derived from thermal infrared imagery having proper spatial and temporal characteristics glenn et al 2010 olivera guerra et al 2017 this approach however generally suffers from problems of undersampling in space and time due to the high variability of land surface temperature which can hardly be detected by currently available satellite sensors in alternative water balance methods utilize remotely sensed vegetation indices to quantify the more temporally stable biomass amount that would be transpiring in well watered conditions allen et al 2005 mahmoud and gan 2019 the use of vegetation indices to estimate the fractional vegetation cover and related crop coefficients was recently reviewed by senay et al 2015 whilst escarabajal henarejos et al 2015 pursued the same objective based on digital photographs maselli et al 2014 proposed an advancement of this approach i e the ndvi cws method suitable for estimating daily eta in water limited environments the method uses ndvi to separate evaporating and transpiring land surfaces and incorporates meteorological scalars which take into account short term water stress these scalars are obtained from the combination of local precipitation and et0 observations under the assumption that rainfall is the unique water source for the examined ecosystem while this assumption generally holds for rainfed grasslands it is clearly inadequate for grasses which are fed by other water sources adjacent ponds or streams water table etc and particularly for crops grown during the dry season which are usually irrigated to address these cases the ndvi cws method must therefore be modified which is the subject of the current investigation more specifically this investigation aims at developing and testing a method to modify the original water stress scalars accounting for water supply additional to rainfall in particular irrigation the following section introduces the conceptual basis of the original and modified ndvi cws method secondly the two versions of the method are tested in two areas covered by rainfed and irrigated herbaceous ecosystems in particular the two study sites are covered by vegetation types which are representative of typical mediterranean grasslands and croplands the results obtained are finally discussed and commented in the two conclusive sections 2 methodological framework 2 1 ndvi cws eta estimation method the ndvi cws method combines conventional meteorological observations i e air temperature precipitation and solar radiation and satellite ndvi images to produce daily eta estimates maselli et al 2014 the theoretical basis of the method implies the separation between transpiration and evaporation processes and their reduction in response to water stress the method distinguishes between a reversible status strain phase during which plants affected by water stress tend to reduce transpiration and a permanent damage phase induced by long lasting water shortage which leads to a reduction in green biomass and ndvi accordingly two short term water stress factors are considered which reduce transpiration to half of its potential and evaporation to zero see maselli et al 2014 for details these scalars are derived from a simplified site water balance as the ratio between rainfall and et0 both cumulated over relatively short time periods few weeks such accumulation integrates the occasional water inputs rainfalls and the continuous outputs et0 so as to reproduce the soil water content dynamic which regulates transient eta reduction mechanisms maselli et al 2009 west et al 2019 computationally the fractional vegetation cover fvc is utilised to account for the contribution of transpiration and evaporation obtaining daily eta by means of the following equations 1 eta et0 fvc kcveg cws 1 fvc kcsoil aw where cws and aw are the two short term water stress scalars for transpiration and evaporation and kcveg and kcsoil correspond to the maximum crop coefficients for vegetation and soil respectively 1 2 and 0 2 for grasslands all referred to the study day fvc is derived from ndvi through the generalised linear equation proposed by gutman and ignatov 1998 which is applicable to atmospherically corrected ndvi imagery cws and aw are instead obtained by combining conventional meteorological data i e daily rainfall and et0 observations through the following equations 2 aw rain et0 where both rain and et0 are cumulated over one month for grasses and aw is constrained to 1 cws is derived from aw as 3 cws 0 5 0 5 aw the ndvi cws method has been successfully tested for various types of rainfed mediterranean ecosystems such as coniferous and deciduous forests grasslands and olive groves maselli et al 2014 battista et al 2016 chiesi et al 2019 when applied to annual grasses and crops the original method accounts for possible water sources alternative to rainfall mainly irrigation by deactivating the two water stress scalars when ndvi exceeds a certain threshold 0 6 during the summer dry season this approach usually provides reasonable results over relatively large areas but is clearly suboptimal when applied to specific fields thus the ndvi cws method must be modified for extending its applicability to any type of herbaceous ecosystem which may be fed by water supply additional to rainfall particularly annual grasses and crops this objective can be pursued relying on the following considerations i herbaceous vegetation has generally a limited capacity to use the water stored in deep soil layers grasslands are therefore readily responsive to water deficit maselli et al 2012 ii in particular annual grasses and crops grown in rainfed condition having a brief growing cycle few months and poorly developed rooting systems tend to respond rapidly to the soil water shortage which is induced by persistent meteorological water stress pereira et al 2007 west et al 2019 iii more precisely the reversible response of annual grasses and crops to soil water shortage strain phase is almost immediate while the green biomass reduction damage phase occurs after a certain period 1 2 weeks of water stress iv consequently increasing or stable grass crop fvc after this period can be supposed to indicate the occurrence of water supply additional to rainfall in contrast an fvc decrease which progresses during the water stress period indicates no or limited additional water supply v temporal fvc variations during the dry period can therefore be taken as indicative of the water really supplied to annual grasses or crops according to this conceptual framework the annual maximum development of rainfed herbaceous ecosystems should be reached before severe water limitation i e around the beginning of the water stress season ozdogan and gutman 2008 maselli et al 2014 an fvc increment after this period may therefore be considered as indicative of additional water supply and used to modify the original water stress scalars aw and cws this is performed by defining a normalized fvc fvcnorm which starting from the beginning of the dry period tends to 0 when fvc decreases while approaches 1 when fvc increases or remains close to the progressive maximum 4 fvcnorm fvc fvcmin fvcmax fvcmin where fvcmin and fvcmax are found progressively since the beginning of the water stress season i e when aw becomes lower than 1 next this new index is combined with the original aw through 5 awfvc max aw fvcnorm which reduces the impact of water limitation i e increases aw up to 1 when fvc approaches the progressive maximum while is virtually not influential i e tends to the original aw when fvc is close to the progressive minimum finally awfvc is used together with the corresponding modified cws eq 3 to drive a modified version of eq 1 which can be applied during the period of possible irrigation as can be easily understood this awfvc computation algorithm is more sensitive to temporal fvc ndvi variations than to absolute fvc values from an eco physiological viewpoint this functioning accounts for the possible variability in fvc response to environmental factors whose theoretical basis and implications will be examined in the discussion section simultaneously the algorithm minimizes the redundancy of awfvc with fvc in eq 1 which could negatively affect the prediction of eta the functioning of the awfvc computation algorithm is exemplified in fig 1 a c fig 1a shows an annual meteorological evolution typical of the mediterranean climate rainfalls are relatively abundant in spring and scarce in summer in coincidence with the maximum plant water requirement this determines a water stress period from may to september which is clearly visible in the seasonal evolution of the meteorological water stress scalar aw fig 1b the growth of a typical rainfed crop follows this meteorological pattern having an ndvi maximum in late spring and a relative minimum in summer this leads to a clear summer minimum of eta predicted by eq 1 which is consequent on the decrease of both the original water stress scalars and of ndvi the same ndvi evolution leaves awfvc unaltered with respect to the original aw and consequently does not change the eta predicted using the modified scalars the case is different for a summer crop fig 1c whose growth during the dry period indicated by an ndvi rise can be sustained only by artificial water supply irrigation consequently the ndvi rise after the start of the dry season leads to a prompt modification of awfvc i e to a full or partial deactivation of the water stress scalars in july august this induces a notable increase in the eta predicted using awfvc in place of aw which correctly accounts for the null or reduced impact of short term water stress on irrigated vegetation the water stress scalars can be deactivated in any period of the dry season depending on the timing and duration of the crop growing cycle and on the consequent ndvi evolution for example awfvc values close to 1 can occur from the start of the dry season to august or from july to the end of the season in cases of early or late summer crops respectively in all cases the temporal resolution of the modified scalars is constrained by the available ndvi imagery i e it depends on the frequency of actually usable ndvi observations the proposed modification should obviously be active only in cases of water supply additional to rainfall specifically irrigation thus in each case study a test is first made to ascertain that the original water stress scalars are modified only marginally in rainfed condition secondly another test is conducted to evaluate the effect of the modification under irrigated condition particularly for the estimation of eta 3 case studies 3 1 study areas and data 3 1 1 pescia the first study site is located in an experimental area of the crea research centre for

information was derived from a regional soil database complemented with the results of crop simulations driven by the regional agrometeorological service see http agroambiente info arsia toscana it specific ground observations were instead collected for the tomato field during the same growing season tomato plants were transplanted on 28th april and fruits were harvested on the 31st july drip

described in the cited references the entire procedure was repeated for each study site using the available ground and satellite datasets firstly the interpolated meteorological data of each site were combined to compute et0 aw and cws as reported in maselli et al 2014 secondly the available sentinel 2 images were preprocessed in order to obtain 15 day ndvi maximum value composites mvc minimally affected by atmospheric disturbances maselli et al 2020 mean ndvi values were then extracted from the 10 m pixels corresponding to the study meadows or fields more precisely two and four pixels were considered for the small irrigated and rainfed meadows of pescia respectively at least 10 pixels were instead considered for the relatively large fields of roselle table 1 ndvi was converted into fvc linearly interpolated to daily values and smoothed by a temporal filtering maselli et al 2020 next the weather and satellite data of each site were used to drive eq 1 where aw and cws were computed by means of eq s 2 3 the operation was repeated using the modified water stress scalars computed by eq s 4 5 which were applied from mid may to mid october the results obtained in these experiments were first visually examined the effect of the methodological modification in two of the irrigated cases meadow of pescia and tomato field of roselle was then quantitatively assessed by comparing the different eta estimates to ground eta observations the latter were produced by applying a variant of the classical fao crop coefficient kc approach to the weather irrigation and swc measurements collected in situ allen et al 2005 the method combines daily et0 with time varying kc defined as the ratio of the eta observable for a fully watered crop over et0 possible water limitation is accounted for through the use of a water stress coefficient ks the daily eta of any ecosystem can therefore be obtained as 6 eta et0 kc ks where kc is the temporally variable crop coefficient which is strictly dependent on the characteristics of the plants considered and ks is the water stress coefficient both referred to each study day allen et al 2005 the kc of the pescia meadow was set to a constant value of 1 while that of the roselle tomato field varied between 0 26 1 1 as fully described in maselli et al 2020 ks was instead obtained combining the available ground observations as reported in chiesi et al 2018 the results of the final comparison between the ground eta observations and the respective estimates were summarized by means of common accuracy statistics r2 rmse and mbe 3 3 results 3 3 1 pescia the meteorology of the first study site pescia during 2018 is typical of the mediterranean climate fig 3 rainfall is relatively abundant till mid may and almost null in summer while et0 reaches its maximum just after the summer solstice the combination of these patterns induces a marked dry period from the beginning of june to the end of september which is clearly reflected in the evolution of the original water stress scalar aw during the growing season i e in the period 1st april 31st october 2018 fig 4 a water stress is evident till the end of september and completely vanishes after about one month fig 4b shows the fvc evolution of the pescia rainfed meadow meadow 1 during the same period fvc reaches a maximum at the end of april 0 65 and then steadily decreases till the end of august due to this trend awfvc is modified only marginally with respect to the original scalar fig 4a this obviously implies a very small and insignificant difference of the ndvi cws eta estimates obtained using the original and modified scalars below 1 data not shown the case is completely different for the other meadow meadow 2 whose fvc is regularly increasing from may to october consequent on the continuous irrigation since the beginning of june this induces a clear modification of awfvc fig 4a which remains constantly close to 1 for the whole irrigation period i e from the beginning of june to mid october the evolution of the ground eta obtained by equation 6 is shown in fig 5 due to the irrigation water supply ks remains always higher than 0 8 so that eta is almost insensitive to water stress and closely follows et0 for the whole year the total annual value is about 630 mm with daily peaks of 5 mm close to the solstice the use of the ndvi cws method driven by the original water stress scalars causes a clear drop of estimated eta since the beginning of june fig 5 consequently the eta obtained using these scalars is highly underestimated mbe 0 92 mm the accuracy of the estimates is highly improved when utilising the modified scalars which nullify the effect of water stress r2 increases from 0 446 to 0 877 rmse decreases from 1 26 to 0 50 mm and mbe is reduced to 0 24 mm 3 3 2 roselle the meteorology of the roselle site during 2018 is typical for the semi arid plain around the town of grosseto fig 6 rainfall is concentrated in spring and autumn with a minimum during the hottest summer season this seasonal pattern is reflected into the annual evolution of the meteorological water stress scalar aw which is shown in fig 7 a no water stress is detected until the beginning of june next there is a first aw decrease followed by a slight recovery after some rainfalls around the middle of june water becomes strongly limiting during the driest summer period being aw low up to october when abundant rainfalls occur fig 7b shows the evolution of fvc for two rainfed fields one grown with wheat and the other with chickpea table 2 the wheat evolution is typical of mediterranean winter crops i e has a peak in april followed by a steep decrease which is partly consequent on harvest in june a slight recovery is then visible in autumn when rainfalls feed the re growth of semi natural grasses the fvc evolution of chickpea which is a spring crop more resistant to aridity is characterised by a later development followed by a decrease in july both evolutions induce null or only marginal modifications in the original water stress scalars a slight difference is only visible for the wheat field due to the fall vegetation recovery as for the rainfed site of pescia the difference brought for eta estimation when using the new versus the original scalars is marginal still below 1 data not shown fig 8 a shows the same water stress scalars for the two irrigated fields grown with the early and late corn varieties described in table 2 the growing cycle of both crops is about 120 days and can be clearly characterised by their fvc evolution the former field i e corn early shows a maximum fvc development around mid june followed by a slight decrease till the end of august and a clear drop after harvest fig 8b this evolution is reflected into that of awfvc which has a maximum during the fvc increase next awfvc diminishes following a slight fvc decrease in the second half of august an abrupt decrease in awfvc occurs as a consequence of the green biomass reduction and the two factors become again coincident at the beginning of september in the case of the corn late field the evolution of fvc shows two diversified peaks the first occurs in early spring before the beginning of the dry season and is due to the presence of ryegrass which is grown in rainfed condition before the corn growing cycle from the end of june to the beginning of october this is reflected into the awfvc evolution of fig 8a which follows the original scalar till the end of june next corn begins to grow and awfvc approaches 1 the maximum awfvc value is maintained up to the fvc reduction after harvest beginning of october when fvc decreases and the two scalars become again coincident the last crop analyzed is the early variety of tomato which was fully characterised by ground observations in this case tomato is transplanted at the end of april and the growing cycle lasts about 90 days table 2 and fig 9 fvc shows a sudden increase after transplanting up to about 0 78 at the end of june then it slightly decreases and drops at the end of july following this trend awfvc remains close to 1 till the beginning of july and returns coincident with the original scalar at the beginning of august fig 10 shows the assessment of the daily eta estimated using the original and modified water stress scalars against ground data the ground eta is available only for the growing cycle of tomato i e from the end of april to the end of july when meteorological irrigation and swc measurements were collected also in this case ks remains constantly high 0 8 from the middle of june to the end of july due to the water supplied by irrigation the amount of water lost during the crop growing cycle is about 370 mm with a maximum daily peak around 10 mm which corresponds to the maximum crop development the use of the original water stress scalars is not capable of reproducing the ground eta pattern when irrigation occurs i e after mid june leading to a strong underestimation of eta the use of awfvc corrects this underestimation improving all accuracy statistics r2 increases from 0 814 to 0 933 while rmse and mbe decrease from 1 73 to 0 57 mm and from 1 33 to 0 19 mm respectively 4 discussion remote sensing eta estimation methods based on the energy balance approach derive information about actual land conditions from thermal infrared imagery this imagery is promptly responsive to the actual water status of soil and above all vegetation due to the immediate reduction of surface temperature caused by both evaporation and transpiration processes van eekelen et al 2015 as previously mentioned however thermal infrared imagery suffers from undersampling issues due to the insufficient spatio temporal details provided by existing satellite systems water balance eta estimation methods which utilize ndvi or other vegetation indices as indicative of green biomass amount are more temporally stable and therefore less subjected to the mentioned undersampling issues this is particularly the case after the recent launch of the sentinel 2 satellite mission which routinely provides frequent high spatial resolution ndvi images in their basic form however water balance methods are applicable only to well watered crops since green biomass amount and vis are not immediately responsive to transient water stress which is mostly reflected into reversible eco physiological adaptations i e stomata closure and other mechanisms which increase plant resistance to water loss maselli et al 2009 joiner et al 2018 the ndvi cws method overcomes this problem by utilising two short term water stress scalars derived from standard meteorological datasets i e temperature rainfall and radiation observations the method is consequently suboptimal when water can be provided by other sources and particularly by irrigation whose occurrence is generally irregular and difficult to assess over large agricultural areas to cope with these cases which are common in semi arid mediterranean areas a modification has been proposed that is theoretically based on identifying a divergence in the seasonal evolution of meteorological water stress and ndvi in particular the new method relies on the working hypothesis that following persistent meteorological water stress the ndvi of annual crops should tend to decrease in the absence of water sources alternative to rainfall this hypothesis is actually supported by both theoretical considerations and experimental observations which have demonstrated that grass ndvi is sensitive to intense soil water shortage herbaceous vegetation in fact reacts to a few days of water depletion in the rooting zone with leaf wilting and yellowing and consequent ndvi decrease joiner et al 2018 as previously noted this is particularly the case for annual grasses which having more limited rooting systems are more rapidly responsive to soil water shortage pereira et al 2007 these considerations provide the rationale for using the temporal ndvi variation at a scale of 10 15 days which is that observable from the used mvc images to predict the actual impact of meteorological water stress on annual crops when an ndvi fvc decrease does not occur after the beginning of the dry period water supply additional to rainfall can be plausibly supposed with consequent modification of the water stress scalars used to feed the ndvi cws method while the most obvious solution to modify the water stress scalars would be based on a temporal derivative of fvc the function currently chosen consists of a progressive normalization operation which more thoroughly exploits the seasonal fvc evolution since the beginning of the water stress period this operation makes fvcnorm equal 0 when fvc is decreasing 1 when fvc is increasing and intermediate values when fvc is between the dry season minimum and maximum after composing this index with aw the original water stress scalars are modified only when fvc is increasing or close to the seasonal maximum while are practically unaltered when fvc decreases this modification strategy is effective up to the end of the dry season i e when aw 1 after which both aw and fvcnorm usually recover as a consequence of autumn rainfalls the same strategy implies that the magnitude of fvc is poorly influential on the modified water stress scalars the progressive normalization operation made through eq 4 in fact is functionally similar to an fvc derivative in time which deactivates the meteorological scalars when a rise or relatively high value of fvc is detected during the water stress period the effect of the modification is therefore given by the temporal fvc variation since the beginning of the dry period so that the modified scalars are mostly independent of absolute fvc values for example intermediate but increasing fvc in water stress condition will deactivate the scalars producing moderate eta estimates while higher but decreasing fvc will activate the scalars and produce lower eta estimates this possible uncoupling between fvc and awfvc is a distinctive feature of the modified ndvi cws method which accounts for the variable dependence of ndvi fvc on water availability remote sensing vegetation indices in fact are indicative of green biomass whose response to water stress is affected by numerous factors such as vegetation type soil features management practices etc in all rainfed cases however the green biomass and thus the fvc of annual grasses and crops can be expected to decrease in response to lasting meteorological water stress while a rising or steadily high fvc can be assumed to be indicative of water supply additional to rainfall which for croplands usually corresponds to irrigation agricultural activities add to this scheme modifying the crop growing cycles but leaving mostly unaltered the general functioning of the method at least in the examined mediterranean context winter and spring crops such as wheat are usually harvested before the period of intense water stress the corresponding fvc decrease leads to a correct identification of non irrigated condition early summer crops are sowed or transplanted in mid spring the marked fvc rise around the beginning of the water stress period indicates the immediate occurrence of irrigation which lasts until the fvc drop at the end of the growing cycle july august finally late summer crops which may be preceded by other crops as ryegrass or alfalfa are planted in late spring no irrigation is detected during the possible fvc decrease of the first crop growing cycle while additional water supply is predicted from the following fvc rise to the fvc drop at end of the growing season september october this theoretical framework is supported by the experimental results obtained in two study areas covered by rainfed and irrigated mediterranean herbaceous ecosystems the new method produces no modification of the original water stress scalars in rainfed condition when fvc naturally tends to decrease after the spring peak the same method instead reduces water limitation when fvc increases or is close to the seasonal maximum during the dry season which is indicative of well watered and presumably irrigated condition the assessment of the ndvi cws eta estimates versus ground observations confirms that in the latter case the original water stress scalars are clearly inadequate producing a strong eta underestimation during the irrigation period this underestimation is almost completely corrected by the new scalars which can produce accurate eta estimates for both sites examined irrigation is the primary water source for grasses and crops during the summer dry period but other sources additional to rainfall can also exist such as adjacent ponds streams canals shallow water table etc exploring the efficiency of the modified ndvi cws method in these cases would require the collection and analysis of additional representative datasets which is beyond the scope of the current investigation it can be hypothesized however that the water supply from most of these sources would postpone the spring ndvi peak and increase the following ndvi values depending on the intensity and timing of the phenomenon these ndvi increments would modify the water stress scalars to different extents and durations anyway reducing the transient impact of water limitation for example the presence of spring ponds in a grassland should induce an ndvi peak delayed with respect to beginning of the water stress period which would make awfvc approach 1 for the subsequent days weeks followed by a decrement slower than that of the original aw 5 conclusions the current paper proposes a modification of the ndvi cws method which was envisaged for predicting eta in water limited mediterranean regions recent works have shown that this method can be effectively applied to spatially fragmented agricultural areas gaining profit from the enhanced spatial and temporal properties of sentinel 2 ndvi imagery maselli et al 2020 the original method however is based on the use of meteorological water stress scalars which cannot directly account for water supply additional to rainfall i e irrigated condition the modification currently proposed addresses this issue relying on an eco physiological logic whose validity has been assessed in two experimental cases the results of these experiments demonstrate that the modified ndvi cws method is suitable for predicting the eta of annual grasses and crops which can be irrigated during the summer dry season consequently the method could be implemented for the operational monitoring of croplands in mediterranean regions in sight of this implementation further tests should be conducted to assess the performance of the method at various spatial resolutions and in different eco climatic conditions the operational monitoring of cropland eta could be particularly rewarding for assessing the water resources used for irrigation at regional and sub regional scales the knowledge of these resources is in fact of primary importance for regulating conflicts among different water uses i e for civil industrial and agricultural purposes which is a rising issue in many regions of the globe as a consequence of both
