13690,this study aimed to investigate the biohydrogen and biomethane potential of palm oil mill effluent pome in a two stage anaerobic digestion ad system under thermophilic 55 3 c and mesophilic 30 3 c conditions respectively among the initial loadings of 0 5 g cod 1 0 g cod or 1 5 g cod the best production potentials of 106 13 ml h2 g cod and 334 56 m l ch4 g codadded corresponding to the total energy production of 13 61 kj g codadded were obtained from pome with an initial 0 5 g cod loading the investigation also revealed that the energy yield ch4 h2 achieved from two stage ad was approximately 38 95 higher than single stage anaerobic digestion single stage ad where only methane energy carrier was produced continuous hydrogen and methane production were subsequently performed in a series of continuous stirred tank reactor cstr and anaerobic horizontal baffled channel ahbc reactor to treat pome without external supplement the results revealed that the highest hydrogen yield of 86 m l h2 g codadded was generated at 3 day hrt while the highest methane production was obtained from hrt over 35 days with a yield of 250 33 m l ch4 g codadded additionally the overall cod removal in the continuous process was approximately 66 27 as a highly efficient organic matter removal and higher energy recovery the continuous two stage ad can be further developed to industrial scale mixed hydrogen and methane production from pome keywords anaerobic digestion process palm oil mill effluent hydrogen production methane production 1 introduction palm oil is a major edible oil that is consumed globally its extraction process generates liquid waste commonly called palm oil mill effluent pome at approximately 2500 m3 pome ton crude palm oil pome is a thick brown liquid with high organic matter content and chemical oxygen demand cod of about 85 g l approximately 95 96 water 0 6 0 7 oil and 4 5 total solids ts it leaves the extraction process at around 80 90 c and a low ph of about 3 5 4 2 1 3 in addition pome also contains important trace elements such as potassium k nitrogen n magnesium mg phosphorus p calcium ca nickel ni and cobalt co at around 2270 750 615 180 439 0 011 and 0 002 mg l 4 5 this indicates that it is possible to produce biogas without adding an external nutrient for anaerobic digester where methane production takes place mesophilic conditions usually result in more stable biogas production 6 therefore before feeding warm pome to the main anaerobic treatment plant it has to be cooled in an equalizing pond in which both methane and carbon dioxide are capably produced and released into the atmosphere 1 recent investigations indicate that the energy carrier loss from the pome cooling pond can be recovered through dark fermentation 1 7 hydrogen and carbon dioxide are simultaneously produced together with volatile fatty acids vfas and alcohols in dark fermentation the vfa rich effluent from dark fermentation is an ideal substrate for methane production in the conventional anaerobic process while the sequential combination of dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion is generally named two stage ad process both gaseous biofuels hydrogen and methane can be collected in the two stage ad process while only methane can be collected as fuel through a single stage anaerobic digestion single stage ad process biohydrogen is a promising energy carrier because of its high specific heating value of 122 kj g and gives only water as a combustion product 8 previous studies have reported that the two stage ad gains higher total energy recovery 8 43 than the single stage ad process and a higher biodegradability that leads to lower cod in the discharge 1 9 the significantly higher overall energy recovery yield of the two stage ad depends on the biodegradability level of such substrates and the operating conditions although higher input energy may be required for enhancing biogas production especially in the hydrolysis step furthermore higher investment is required for additional reactor and equipment for the two stage ad process kargi et al 10 reported that thermophilic dark fermentation is more beneficial than the mesophilic dark fermentation therefore a warm pome could be suitably subjected to the thermophilic dark fermentation process to produce hydrogen this process can lead to several advantages such as enhanced hydrolysis rate faster growth of bacteria and better thermodynamic favorability resulting in an increased chemical and biological reaction rate 11 the process configuration and its operating conditions influence hydrogen and methane production such as hydraulic retention time hrt influent concentration substrate characterization temperature reactor configuration ph and buffering capacity 12 13 the biogas production rate could be optimized by the hrt of the reactor however process imbalance might occur when hrt is decreased and the accumulation of vfas and ph drops thus decreasing biogas production 13 proper hrt depends on substrate characteristics reactor configuration and operating conditions such as temperature therefore an optimum hrt has to be investigated for each system the ph and buffering capacity significantly affect acidogens and methanogens hydrogenase activity via their metabolism pathway several reports have reported that an optimum initial ph is in the range 5 0 6 0 and 6 0 7 0 for the first stage and the second stage anaerobic digestion respectively experimentally tested by using bicarbonate to control ph and alkalinity 14 15 ph measurement is an easy and inexpensive method therefore assessing the reactor performance using ph together with operating at an acceptable range of hrt could be a promising control strategy for biogas production continuous stirred tank reactor cstr has been developed for treating high strength waste with accompanying biogas production substrate distribution is uniform throughout the reactor the main advantages of using cstr include that reaction kinetics could be improved by vigorous mixing therefore it can be operated with a comparatively short hydraulic retention time 12 as high suspended solids and relatively high viscosity of pome cstr is perfectly suitable for pome treatment besides the plug flow reactor pfr is used in a variety of biogas plants physically similar to an anaerobic baffled reactor abr or up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb 16 most biogas plants of palm oil mills have a channel digester therefore in this study a typical channel digester was modified to anaerobic horizontal baffled channel ahbc reactor the ahbc reactor mentioned above designed in this study does not require mechanical mixing is suitable for operation under high organic loading conditions and a long hrt and has a relatively low construction cost two stage ad of pome has been reported for using different operating conditions and bioreactor combinations 1 7 17 20 the efficiency of pome degradation was investigated in the uasb reactor and cstr using two stage thermophilic and mesophilic fermentation 18 18 19 20 total energy recovery equivalent to 661 02 mj m3 pome was achieved from a semi continuous stirred tank reactor scstr for a two stage ad of pome 7 furthermore hydrogen and methane yields of 210 and 315 ml g cod respectively were achieved at an organic loading rate olr of 60 and 6 g cod l d in anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr and uasb however the approach used in the study cited above required external nutrients iron nitrogen and phosphorus supplementation 1 to the best of our knowledge there remains questions of kinetic parameters and the process may be impractical in an industrial scale treatment system the characteristic of pome varies depending on the production process and oil recovery efficiencies therefore the first objective of this study was to investigate the bhp and bmp of various initial organic loading and to evaluate how much energy recovery from pome could be enhanced by thermophilic mesophilic two stage ad the bhp and bmp results achieved could be more proper for the further preliminary design of the two stage ad process for the factory which provided pome for this investigation the second objective was to evaluate and monitor biohydrogen production in the first stage hydrolysis and acidogenesis of a two stage anaerobic digestion process from pome in cstr reactor under thermophilic conditions and methane production in the second stage mainly acetogenesis and methanogenesis of a two stage anaerobic digestion process using effluent from the first stage as a substrate in an ahbc reactor under ambient conditions without additional supplements 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic seed sludge and substrate anaerobic seed sludge for hydrogen production was obtained from a lab scale continuous stirred tank reactor cstr producing hydrogen by co fermentation of skim latex serum sls and pome 21 before use the anaerobic seed sludge was acclimated with pome under thermophilic temperature 55 c until steady hydrogen production anaerobic digester sludge was collected from a mesophilic digester treating pome of palm pattana southern border co ltd pattani thailand and was used as seed sludge for methane production the raw pome was collected from the receiving tank of palm pattana southern border co ltd pattani thailand the temperature of the discharged pome ranged from 75 82 c and the raw pome was an acidic colloidal mixture at ph 4 2 of brown color the pome was characterized see table 1 and kept at 4 c until use 2 2 biohydrogen potential bhp and biomethane potential bmp in batch mode bhp and bmp of two stage ad were determined in batch mode by using 120 ml and 500 ml serum bottles respectively in each bhp bottle comprised of 15 ml of inoculum 15 ml of basic anaerobic ba medium prepared as described by angelidaki and sanders 22 and 30 ml of calculated pome volume balanced with deionized water the mixtures were then purged with n2 100 at 0 5 l min for 5 min to ensure anaerobic conditions before closing with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum clamp triplicate blanks containing distilled water inoculums and ba medium were also processed positive controls were carried out using brown sugar at initial loading of 0 67 g cod 11 2 g cod l when hydrogen production reached a steady state the mixture was transferred into a 500 ml serum bottle which contained 140 ml seed sludge for the bmp test at that bottle was purged with nitrogen gas before closing with butyl rubber stopper and aluminum clamp the bhp and bmp were determined at thermophilic 55 3 c and ambient temperatures 30 3 c respectively the produced biogas volumes and compositions were measured daily the bmp of single stage ad process was determined for comparison the different initial pome loadings of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 g cod respectively were tested to investigate the effects of organic loading on bhp and bmp statistically significant differences in biogas production were determined using a one way analysis of variance anova in spss v26 0 ibm usa 2 3 reactor set up and operation continuous hydrogen and methane production using a two stage ad process had a cstr in the first stage for hydrogen production and an ahbc reactor in the second stage for methane production fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental set up for continuous hydrogen and methane production in this study the apparatus had two main parts the first for hydrogen production included an influent tank for mixing raw pome the cstr reactor 1 35 l working and an effluent tank one liter of acclimated anaerobic seed sludge and 0 35 l of pome were first placed in the cstr and to ensure anaerobic conditions the system was purged with nitrogen gas at 2 l min for 10 min the reactor was initially started in batch mode for 48 h with temperature control in order to acclimatize the inoculum the reactor was then operated in cstr mode at 55 c continuously stirred with a magnetic bar at 150 rpm temperature controlled by water circulation in a jacket over the reactor and hydraulic retention time hrt ranged from 1 to 7 days due to the relatively small scale of the cstr the substrate was fed twice daily with a peristaltic pump at 5 ml min for the set substrate volume corresponding to the desired hrt the ph of raw pome was adjusted to 6 7 with 5 g nahco3 l pome before feeding to the cstr to keep an effluent ph of about 5 0 6 0 the hrt was decreased when the system reached a steady state hydrogen content biogas volume and ph all varied by less than 10 relative standard deviation rsd the biogas produced was measured while the biogas composition was analyzed daily with liquid samples taken every 24 h from the effluent overflow when the substrate was fed to analyze for ph and volatile fatty acids the second stage for methane production was carried out in a transparent acrylic ahbc reactor with 8 cm width 65 cm length and 18 cm height 9 3 l the above dimensions imitate the biogas plant of palm pattana biogas company the methane production was commenced by feeding 4 9 l of anaerobic digester sludge and 2 1 l of effluent from hydrogen production in the first stage hrt 2 and 3 days as a substrate to the reactor 7 l working volume nitrogen gas at 2 l min was used to purge for 20 min to ensure anaerobic conditions the reactor was started at hrt 40 days and operated at ambient temperature similar to the cstr operation the effluent from cstr was fed to ahbc reactor twice daily at 5 ml min for the volume corresponding to the set hrt the effect of hrt at 80 60 40 and 35 days respectively on the methane production was investigated during fermentation the system was mechanically mixed by liquid circulation using a peristaltic pump at 0 2 l min the biogas produced was measured and the biogas composition was analyzed daily with liquid samples taken every 24 h from the effluent overflow when the substrate was fed to analyze for the ph value the effluent at hrt 35 days at a steady state was sampled to analyze for the volatile fatty acids 2 4 analytical methods the volume of biogas production was recorded by using water displacement the volume of gas produced in blank was subtracted from the volume produced in substrate fermentation before expressing as bhp or bmp the biogas composition was measured using a gas chromatography gc shimadzu gc 14a shimadzu corp kyoto japan equipped with a stainless steel column 2 m packed with molecular sieve 58 80 100 mesh and a thermal conductivity detector tcd each sample of biogas 0 5 ml was injected into the gc with argon as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 35 ml min the gc column injection port oven and detector all set at a temperature of 100 c liquid samples were taken at designated times for further analysis of volatile fatty acid vfa using high performance liquid chromatography hplc hp 1100 hewlett packard germany equipped with pinnacle ii c18 column and ultraviolet uv detector at 210 nm the high performance liquid chromatography was performed using the following conditions 2 5 mm h2so4 was used as mobile phase at 0 8 ml min flow rate and 45 c oven temperature the liquor samples were first centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and then filtered through with a 0 45 μm nylon membrane ph cod total solids ts volatile solids vs oil and grease and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn were determined following the procedures described in the standard methods 15 the microbial communities in both h2 and ch4 reactors were characterized using the methods described in a previous study by jariyaboon et al 24 2 5 kinetic model analysis for batch fermentation models for describing and predicting the kinetics of anaerobic digestion include the cone model eq 1 a first order kinetic model eq 2 and the dual pool first order kinetic model eq 3 25 the models mentioned above were used to fit the cumulative hydrogen and methane production obtained from experiments 1 cone model m t m m 1 k t n 2 f i r s t o r d e r k i n e t i c m o d e l m t m m 1 e k t 3 d u a l p o o l f i r s t o r d e r k i n e t i c m o d e l m t m m 1 e k f t 1 e k l t here m

microsoft excel 2010 with a solver add in program microsoft usa was used to determine the kinetic parameters the correlation coefficients r2 were also obtained 2 6 kinetic model analysis for continuous fermentation for a continuous process the material balance at steady state of biogas production in cstr and ahbc reactor can be written as eq 4 4 v 0 c v 0 c 0 v r r c where v0 is the substrate flow rate c and c0 are the average inlet and outlet cods at steady state vr is working volume and rc is cod removal rate which can be expressed by first order kinetics shown in eq 5 5 r c k c c where kc is the first order rate constant of continuous hydrogen or methane production 1 d by combining eqs 4 and 5 with vr c0 hrt at steady state eq 6 is obtained kc at any hrt can be calculated from fractional cod removal efficiency re as eq 7 6 h r t 1 k c c 0 c 1 7 k c 1 h r t 1 1 r e 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of palm oil mill effluent the physical and chemical characteristics of pome are shown in table 1 the pome had high concentrations of total solids ts volatile solids vs and high chemical oxygen demand cod at 50 40 and 78 g l respectively indicating concentrated not diluted wastewater thus the pome should be treated before discharge in order to prevent water pollution the high 703 mg l total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn showed a high protein content in the pome c n ratio of 27 59 for this pome was below the optimum c n ratio for hydrogen production taken as 74 as reported by o thong et al 26 low c n ratio reflects high nitrogen content and could evolve ammonia which would adversely affect the activity of microorganisms however the c n ratio 27 58 is suited for methane production in the second stage of a two stage ad a suitable ph for hydrogen producing bacteria is between 5 0 6 0 14 thus there is a need to adjust the ph of pome before feeding into the cstr nahco3 was used to increase the ph of inlet pome while alkalinity was also increased to improve buffering capacity and balance the ph during hydrogen production 3 2 biohydrogen and methane potential of pome batch mode the cumulative hydrogen production from thermophilic dark fermentation at the pome loadings of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 g cod respectively is shown in fig 2 a hydrogen production was observed on the first day of fermentation for all pome loadings a positive control using brown sugar provided the highest hydrogen volume since sugar is the most rapidly fermentable substrate this indicates good activities of the microorganisms used the cumulative hydrogen volume with 1 0 g cod loading was higher than 0 5 g cod as more substrate was available for microorganisms consumption however the hydrogen production decreased when pome loading was 1 5 g cod indicating overloading and or toxic effects from vfa accumulation which lead to a decrease in the ph the initial and final phs of batch fermentation were also monitored the production of bio hydrogen occurred in the acidification phase which decreased the ph of the fermentation the ph decreased from 6 0 to 4 9 5 5 to 4 9 and 5 3 to 4 5 when 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 g cod respectively were loaded as mentioned the optimum ph range for hydrogen production using dark fermentation is 5 0 6 0 thus the 1 5 g cod loadings of pome fermentation which had the most ph was lower than the optimum range achieved from the lowest hydrogen production vfas profile of the fermentation which can be used to estimate the metabolic reaction route is illustrated in fig 2b the highest vfas in the fermentation of about 12 g l at the end of fermentation was found with the initial 1 5 g cod loadings wang et al 27 reported that the activity of methanogenic bacteria was inhibited to a significant extent when the total vfas concentration was above 10 0 g l this inhibitory effect weakened when the vfas concentration reduced to 6 2 8 5 g l at the end of hydrogen production the acid forming bacteria fermented glucose and produced vfas such as acetic butyric propionic and lactic acids according to eqs 8 12 8 acetic acid and butyric acid production favored the production of hydrogen and the acetic acid pathway gave the highest theoretical hydrogen yield in contrast propionic and lactic acid pathways do not generate hydrogen this can explain why the fermentation with 1 5 g cod loadings produced the least hydrogen despite the most total vfas 8 c 6 h 12 o 6 2 h 2 o 2c h 3 cooh 2c o 2 4 h 2 δ g 0 251 7 kj mol 9 3 c 6 h 12 o 6 4c h 3 c h 2 cooh 2c h 3 cooh 2c o 2 2 h 2 o δ g 0 311 2 kj mol 10 c 6 h 12 o 6 c 3 h 7

acid producing bacteria were the main microorganisms in the raw pome while lactic acid was the main vfa in the final fermentation broth a summary of hydrogen yield based on cod is shown in table 2 the maximum hydrogen production yield of 106 13 ml h2 g codadded which is approximately 20 49 of the theoretical value was obtained with 0 5 g cod initial loading additionally the highest hydrogen yield obtained in this study corresponding to 8 2 l h2 l pome initial loading of 8 33 g cod l is higher than 6 5 l h2 l pome which was obtained from the higher initial loading of 64 g cod l reported in the study of o thong et al 26 methane production from the second stage of the two stage ad process using the effluent from the first stage dark fermentation and the single stage ad using raw pome is shown in fig 3 a and b respectively for various initial pome concentrations less than 1 day of lag phase was observed for all batches of methane production 230 99 m l ch4 equating to 344 18 ml ch4 g codadded 88 of the theoretical yield was obtained from the fermentation using brown sugar this indicates that the microorganism used in this batch experiments had good activities vfas in the effluent from the first stage are substrates for acetogens that convert vfas to acetic acid the substrate for methanogens to produce methane the ph at the end of two stage fermentation was 7 3 7 5 indicating that the vfas were consumed thus the two stage ad at all initial loading provides more massive methane production than the single stage ad the maximum methane production yield of 334 56 m l ch4 g codadded which is approximately 86 23 of the theoretical value was obtained with the lowest pome input at 0 5 g cod the ph for the single stage ad was also measured and it was found that the initial ph ranged between 7 3 7 5 which is similar to the ph after fermentation 7 3 7 4 due to ph during the fermentation in this study was not monitored the fluctuation of ph thus was not observed however to better understand the ph dynamics during the fermentation which influences the process efficiencies the measurement of ph during fermentation is suggested energy production corresponding to hydrogen and methane produced is shown in table 2 it can be seen that the highest overall energy yield of 13 61 kj g codadded was achieved at 0 5 g cod initial loading in the two stage ad the two stage ad has a higher potential to recover energy from the warm raw pome than the single stage ad energy recovered from the two stage ad is 38 95 higher than the energy generated in the single stage ad however the higher pome loading at which inhibition could appear is more significant and a lower energy recovery yield is possible cod distributions of all the batch experiments were calculated to demonstrate the material balance during fermentation this is given in table 3 the basis of calculations was the pome input expressed in terms of mg cod the output streams include the product gas phase and the remnants in the fermentation bottle the remaining fraction was analyzed for fatty acids and other components which were cell mass unfermented long chain fatty acids carbohydrate protein and lignin the overall cod removal by two stage ad at pome loadings 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 g cod were 87 64 83 01 and 48 83 respectively while the single stage ad were 68 13 65 28 and 39 39 respectively 3 3 estimation of kinetic model constants for batch fermentation table 4 summarizes the results of the kinetic study for batch experiments using the cone model a first order kinetic model and the dual pool first order kinetic model according to the results all the tested models provided a reasonable fit to the experimental data this is confirmed by the r2 value which was higher than 0 92 the cone model and the dual pool first order kinetic model with the higher r2 are observed as more appropriate than the first order kinetic model this is reconfirmed by the plot of measured and predicted methane yields in fig 4 there was approximately 3 3 times higher concentration of organic loading in the bhp test which caused inhibition by the high strength pome especially at the 1 5 g cod loading thus the biochemical reaction might not follow first order kinetics as seen in table 4 from the low r2 values the experimental results of bhp at the initial pome loading of 1 5 g cod did not fit well with any of the models used in this study other more complex kinetic models with inhibition effects could be further tested the rate constant k of the substrates determined from the cone model varied in the range 0 008 0 73 1 d which was 14 69 higher than those obtained from the first order model this finding is similar to the values reported by nguyen et al 25 methane production rate constants at 1 0 g cod were higher than at 0 5 g cod and 1 5 g cod loading both single stage ad and two stage ad this indicates that the systems were satisfied at 1 0 g cod while at a higher organic loading there was inhibition as mentioned in the previous section it can be further observed that the rate constant of methane production in two stage ad was higher than in single stage ad which reconfirmed the advantage of two stage ad the predicted hydrogen potentials from the fitted models were slightly higher than the values obtained experimentally this might be because the fermentation to produce hydrogen were ceased at 8 days which did not yet reach the highest bio hydrogen potential for methane production the predicted potentials from the first order model were slightly lower than the experimental ones in contrast to the prediction using the cone model similar results on methane production were previously reported by dennehy et al 28 the dual pool first order model was selected to evaluate the kinetic constant in this investigation the reason for selecting the dual pool first order model is because it was developed for two distinct methane generation periods 29 which is similar to the profiles of cumulative production shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively however the solver tool with a non linear regression method was used for kinetic constant fitting and the results are based on the best fitted values the α is the fraction of a rapidly degradable substrate in this study α varied within 0 41 0 74 although pome was the only substrate used this indicates that even though the obtained r2 value obtained signifies that the predicted model was fitted correctly to the experimental data there are still doubts regarding the use of these regression results for pome fermentation hence as the r2 and mm for the cone model appear the most reasonable to describe the biochemical reaction the kinetic constants for this simple model could be the most appropriate to use in further scale up of pome treatment by the anaerobic digestion process 3 4 continuous biohydrogen production in cstr the biohydrogen production rate and yield observed from cstr reactor are shown in fig 5 a and table 5 the results found that in the initial hrt operation hydrogen production was observed from the first day indicating that the acidogenic bacteria in cstr reactor had a good activity level however stable hydrogen production was only attained after 10 days the average hydrogen production rate at a steady state was 0 36 l h2 l reactor d which corresponds to a hydrogen yield of 33 62 ml h2 g codadded for hrt 7 days the average hydrogen production rate increased to 1 46 and 2 18 l h2 l reactor d which correspond to hydrogen yields of 57 33 and 86 00 ml h2 g cod respectively when hrt was reduced to 5 and 3 days respectively when the hrt was further decreased to 2 and 1 day the average hydrogen production rate increased to 2 65 and 5 04 l h2 l reactor d however the average hydrogen yield decreased to 66 15 or 64 50 ml h2 g codadded with hrt at 7 and 5 days low hydrogen production rates and hydrogen yields were achieved at long hrt the substrate for growing hydrogen producing bacteria was limited meanwhile at a limited 2 and 1 day hrt excess substrate was fed and subsequently caused accumulation of hydrogen partial pressure and volatile free fatty acids consequently hydrogen producing bacteria in the system were inhibited moreover oil and grease in the substrate might also inhibit and contribute to low hydrogen yield 30 in order to test the reactor performance after the operation at hrt of 1 day the substrate feed rate was decreased to hrt of 3 days and the average hydrogen rate and hydrogen production yield were similar to hrt of 3 days in phase iii volatile free fatty acids vfas were produced simultaneously with hydrogen fig 5b the distributions of vfas in the soluble metabolite at steady state biohydrogen production were 10 6 14 8 14 2 11 8 and 12 6 g total vfas l with respective hrts of 7 5 3 2 and 1 day lactic acid was the main vfa in the original pome an increase in lactic acid was observed only in hrt of 7 days while in the other cases lactic acid decreased lactic acid can be converted via lactate fermentation pathway which produces hydrogen or via lactic oxidation pathway to produce small molecule vfas as shown in eqs 13 and 14 31 13 2 c h 3 chohcooh 2 h 2 o 2 c h 3

maintained within 5 0 5 5 which is suitable for hydrogen producing bacteria 32 33 this indicates that nahco3 at 5 g nahco3 l pome 0 066 g nahco3 g cod was sufficient to keep the ph of the effluent in the preferred range in this study hydrogen yield was lower than the one reported by mamimin et al 1 their study focused on the continuous hydrogen production under thermophilic conditions with 2 days hrt with an organic loading rate olr of 60 g cod l d in anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr they found a hydrogen yield of 210 m l h2 g codadded 326 4 m l h2 g vs however the raw pome was supplemented with fe2 na2hpo4 2h2o and peptone to reach the optimal c n and c p ratios in contrast no external supplement was added aside from nahco3 for ph control in this current study moreover the asbr used in the study could retain more biomass concentration than the cstr used in our study 3 5 continuous biomethane production in ahbc reactor the methane production in the second stage methanogenic fermentation of the two stage anaerobic digestion process from the effluent from hydrogen production in the first stage acidogenic fermentation was evaluated fig 6 a shows the methane production rate with different hrts in phase i startup the system was operated at hrt of 40 days and no methane was detected in the first 5 days then on the 6th day the ch4 production rate of 80 m l ch4 l reactor d was detected after which the methane production rate sharply increased until the 12th day typically acidogenic bacteria grow faster than acetogenic and methanogenic microorganisms so the consumption rate of vfas was below their production rate and the vfas accumulated reducing ph which reduced methanogen activity an attempt to operate with 40 days hrt was carried out for 10 days more however the ch4 production rate was not improved then twice higher hrt 80 days or lower olr in order to let the microorganism more acclimate was used in phase ii the results showed that ch4 yield increased and became nearly constant within 22 days corresponding to an increased ph in the broth fig 6b this indicates that at this feed rate the system released vfas slowly without inhibiting methanogen activity so vfas and other substrates h2 co2 could be consumed to produce methane and also the biomass population increased therefore the lower 60 days hrt was tested in phase iii to assess the ch4 reactor performance the results show that ch4 production slightly increased to 300 m l ch4 l reactor d a higher feed rate was operated at hrt 40 days phase iv and as expected the methane production rate increased to around 500 ml ch4 l reactor d the performance was then tested at a lower hrt of 35 days in phase v there was no observed significant increase in methane production in this phase at a steady state of 35 day hrt operation a 527 m l ch4 l reactor d production rate was obtained with a yield of 250 33 m l ch4 g codadded equating to 18 4 m l ch4 l pome cod distribution in the continuous two stage ad process of pome in cstr and ahbc reactor is shown in table 6 in cstr at hrt of 3 days 5 40 of cod input was converted to hydrogen and removed from the reactor while for ahbc reactor operated at hrt of 35 days 21366 98 g cod d of methane were produced equating to 60 87 of initial cod loading the overall cod removal in this process was 66 27 demonstrating that cod was remaining in the ahbc reactor effluent and further treatment would be needed the first order kinetic constants kc of continuous hydrogen and methane production in cstr and ahbc reactor respectively were calculated using eq 7 and are presented in table 5 it was observed that kc for hydrogen production ranged within 0 016 0 03 which is about 10 times less than that obtained from the batch process the kc for methane production at hrt 35 days is 0 052 which is near k 0 1 calculated by using the first order model at pome loading 1 5 g cod in the batch process continuous fermentation provided a relatively low production rate and yield compared to the batch process due to no external nutrient addition moreover mixing effects on biocatalyst performance flow and transport phenomena on different scales influence the kinetic behavior of the cells the ideal case of a completely mixed tank can be approximated on a small laboratory scale to consider the conditions in industrial scale reactors bulk circulation patterns in a large scale reactor carry the cells into different regions of the reactor typically having different turbulence levels and dead zones or wash out might occur also in continuous fermentation the substrate characteristics vary more than in batch fermentation 3 6 microbial community the microbial communities of inoculums for hydrogen and methane production by two stage ad in cstr and ahbc reactors were analyzed by pcr dgge and are shown in fig 7 the strong band intensity indicates the dominance of microbial communities mainly clostridium sp enterobacter sp lactobacillus sp and pelotomaculum sp were identified in the cstr reactor fig 7a clostridium sp and enterobacter sp are known for hydrogen production by fermentation and they are obligate and facultative mesophilic anaerobes respectively with favorable conditions to produce hydrogen at ph 5 0 6 0 and 32 40 c 34 35 clostridium sp is present in most hydrogen production systems and can be found in thermophilic conditions this species is applied to treat various kinds of carbohydrates and can degrade phenols 36 lactobacillus sp present in the hydrogen production stage is lactate producers 37 in the presence of oil lactic acid bacteria become one of the significant strains of microflora thermophilic lactobacillus sp can be used to improve or recover digester systems from sour digestion conditions such as higher than normal loadings 38 this corresponds to the high lactic concentration in fermentation broth observed at high pome loading as mentioned earlier in section 3 2 the lactic acid producing pathway in eq 11 does not generate hydrogen which in this study reduced the hydrogen yield below the theoretically calculated based on the acetic producing pathway pelotomaculum sp is a strictly anaerobic and thermophilic organism and can oxidize propionate lactate or several alcohols at 45 65 c optimum 55 c and the ph range for its growth is 6 7 7 5 optimum 7 0 the presence of pelotomaculum sp indicates that saccharide oxidation to propionic occurred in the second stage microbacterium sp and proteiniphilum sp were the dominant bacteria in methane production meanwhile methanocorpusculum sp and methanothrix sp fig 7b were the dominant archaea both of which are acetoclastic methanogens producing methane 39 carillo et al 40 reported that methanocorpusculum labreanum was the most evident archeal found in methane production producing ch4 from h2 and co2 or acting as formate donors at optimal growth temperatures 36 42 c and ph 7 0 8 0 methanothrix sp is also found in mesophilic sewage digesters with an optimum temperature for growth and methane formation at 37 c and an optimal ph range of between 7 4 7 8 39 3 7 perspective for hydrogen and methane recovery from pome table 7 presents a comparison of single stage ad and two stage ad process performances on using pome as a substrate in this study against previous studies methane and energy production of single stage ad in this study had a higher significance when compared with wong et al 41 and chan et al 42 due to a higher olr feed in these studies some previous studies reported a higher methane production than this current study possibly due to different operating conditions abdurahman et al 43 showed that an anaerobic membrane reactor mas demonstrated high performance for decomposing all particulate matter in pome raw pome supplemented with iron nitrogen and phosphorus gave higher biogas yield 1 for the two stage ad process this investigation achieved higher production yield but lower production rate than the one reported by krishnan et al 19 who loaded pome at a high olr the higher energy yield reported by mamimin et al 1 krishnan et al 19 and o thong et al 17 were probably due to the supplementation with iron peptone and na2hpo4 the use of thermophilic conditions 55 c in the second stage anaerobic digestion reported by seengenyoung et al 44 could lead to a higher biogas yield moreover the performance of a full scale biogas plant from pome of palm pattana southern border co ltd pattani thailand is also listed in table 7 the total volume of biogas plant is 12 000 m3 pfr operates at an olr of 2 34 g cod l d under ambient temperature and produces biogas containing 45 55 methane with a biogas production rate of 0 44 l biogas l d methane yield of 186 11 m l ch4 g codadded and energy yield of 6 24 kj g codadded internal mixing by liquid recirculation applied in ahbr reactor in this study might lead to a higher yield of methane production than the one from the factory the ahbr reactor was modified based on the dimensions of the full scale biogas plant therefore the implementation of internal mixing to the pome digester might enhance methane production yield moreover the methane reactor used in this study was fed with the acidogenetic effluent which has been proven to be a more favorable substrate than raw pome and this might have caused the higher methane production yield the results from this study also obviously indicate that adding the dark fermentation reactor for hydrogen production before the conventional biogas production could improve energy recovery and cod removal further downstream processing of anaerobic digestion is required for their beneficial use or safe disposal mixed hydrogen and methane biohythane production in this study gave about 46 47 ch4 12 16 h2 and 36 41 co2 respectively moreover there are also other trace components such as h2s around 3000 4000 ppm 45 h2s content in the biogas needs to be removed by biological physical or chemical methods to prevent corrosion problems currently most palm oil mills in thailand use bioscrubber for upgrading biogas before feeding to biogas generator 45 the utilization of hydrogen containing biogas has been reported to improve the combustion efficiency in a gas engine 46 microalgae and macroalgae are potential candidates for bioremediation of anaerobically treated pome due to their ability to assimilate the contaminants which for them are growth nutrients 47 49 moreover pome digestate is also the primary product and after dewatering the biosolid has the potential to be used as an organic fertilizer 50 despite the happenings in thailand where the single stage ad of pome is generally preferred implementing the dark fermentation instead the pome cooling pond is an approach that ensures significant improvements micolucci et al 33 observed that the two stage reactor using food waste as a substrate has a net 55 higher energy production compared with the single stage reactor the payback time for introducing a fermenter is less than 1 5 years indicating that adding a system for the first anaerobic digestion of pome might be worthwhile the ahbc reactor in this study was modified based on the typical bioreactor mostly used for pome treatment in thailand the reactor performances of continuous processes were also explored with a kinetic analysis therefore it can be concluded that the information retrieved from this article is quite suitable for further scaling up economic and environmental analysis these preliminary results should be driven further by research to better understand the conditions that can drive the two stage ad for treating pome to have higher performance and energy recovery 4 conclusions this work revealed that 38 95 more energy could be recovered from pome using two stage ad than with the conventional single stage ad process the impact of hrt 7 5 3 2 and 1 days was investigated for the continuous hydrogen production in a cstr when the lower hrts were operated the higher production rates were obtained the higher hydrogen production yield was achieved when the lower hrt was fed however the hydrogen productions were dropped when the hrt lower than 3 days was applied the maximum productivity of 5 04 l h2 l reactor d was achieved at hrt of 1 i day while the maximum hydrogen production yield of 86 m l h2 g codadded was obtained at hrt of 3 days the methane production in an ahbc reactor was investigated at hrt of 35 days 0 53 l ch4 l reactor d was achieved with an overall cod removal efficiency cstr ahbc of 66 27 this work also revealed a strategy to efficiently operate continuous hydrogen and methane production from pome by using a buffer nahco3 to maintain the system

13690,this study aimed to investigate the biohydrogen and biomethane potential of palm oil mill effluent pome in a two stage anaerobic digestion ad system under thermophilic 55 3 c and mesophilic 30 3 c conditions respectively among the initial loadings of 0 5 g cod 1 0 g cod or 1 5 g cod the best production potentials of 106 13 ml h2 g cod and 334 56 m l ch4 g codadded corresponding to the total energy production of 13 61 kj g codadded were obtained from pome with an initial 0 5 g cod loading the investigation also revealed that the energy yield ch4 h2 achieved from two stage ad was approximately 38 95 higher than single stage anaerobic digestion single stage ad where only methane energy carrier was produced continuous hydrogen and methane production were subsequently performed in a series of continuous stirred tank reactor cstr and anaerobic horizontal baffled channel ahbc reactor to treat pome without external supplement the results revealed that the highest hydrogen yield of 86 m l h2 g codadded was generated at 3 day hrt while the highest methane production was obtained from hrt over 35 days with a yield of 250 33 m l ch4 g codadded additionally the overall cod removal in the continuous process was approximately 66 27 as a highly efficient organic matter removal and higher energy recovery the continuous two stage ad can be further developed to industrial scale mixed hydrogen and methane production from pome keywords anaerobic digestion process palm oil mill effluent hydrogen production methane production 1 introduction palm oil is a major edible oil that is consumed globally its extraction process generates liquid waste commonly called palm oil mill effluent pome at approximately 2500 m3 pome ton crude palm oil pome is a thick brown liquid with high organic matter content and chemical oxygen demand cod of about 85 g l approximately 95 96 water 0 6 0 7 oil and 4 5 total solids ts it leaves the extraction process at around 80 90 c and a low ph of about 3 5 4 2 1 3 in addition pome also contains important trace elements such as potassium k nitrogen n magnesium mg phosphorus p calcium ca nickel ni and cobalt co at around 2270 750 615 180 439 0 011 and 0 002 mg l 4 5 this indicates that it is possible to produce biogas without adding an external nutrient for anaerobic digester where methane production takes place mesophilic conditions usually result in more stable biogas production 6 therefore before feeding warm pome to the main anaerobic treatment plant it has to be cooled in an equalizing pond in which both methane and carbon dioxide are capably produced and released into the atmosphere 1 recent investigations indicate that the energy carrier loss from the pome cooling pond can be recovered through dark fermentation 1 7 hydrogen and carbon dioxide are simultaneously produced together with volatile fatty acids vfas and alcohols in dark fermentation the vfa rich effluent from dark fermentation is an ideal substrate for methane production in the conventional anaerobic process while the sequential combination of dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion is generally named two stage ad process both gaseous biofuels hydrogen and methane can be collected in the two stage ad process while only methane can be collected as fuel through a single stage anaerobic digestion single stage ad process biohydrogen is a promising energy carrier because of its high specific heating value of 122 kj g and gives only water as a combustion product 8 previous studies have reported that the two stage ad gains higher total energy recovery 8 43 than the single stage ad process and a higher biodegradability that leads to lower cod in the discharge 1 9 the significantly higher overall energy recovery yield of the two stage ad depends on the biodegradability level of such substrates and the operating conditions although higher input energy may be required for enhancing biogas production especially in the hydrolysis step furthermore higher investment is required for additional reactor and equipment for the two stage ad process kargi et al 10 reported that thermophilic dark fermentation is more beneficial than the mesophilic dark fermentation therefore a warm pome could be suitably subjected to the thermophilic dark fermentation process to produce hydrogen this process can lead to several advantages such as enhanced hydrolysis rate faster growth of bacteria and better thermodynamic favorability resulting in an increased chemical and biological reaction rate 11 the process configuration and its operating conditions influence hydrogen and methane production such as hydraulic retention time hrt influent concentration substrate characterization temperature reactor configuration ph and buffering capacity 12 13 the biogas production rate could be optimized by the hrt of the reactor however process imbalance might occur when hrt is decreased and the accumulation of vfas and ph drops thus decreasing biogas production 13 proper hrt depends on substrate characteristics reactor configuration and operating conditions such as temperature therefore an optimum hrt has to be investigated for each system the ph and buffering capacity significantly affect acidogens and methanogens hydrogenase activity via their metabolism pathway several reports have reported that an optimum initial ph is in the range 5 0 6 0 and 6 0 7 0 for the first stage and the second stage anaerobic digestion respectively experimentally tested by using bicarbonate to control ph and alkalinity 14 15 ph measurement is an easy and inexpensive method therefore assessing the reactor performance using ph together with operating at an acceptable range of hrt could be a promising control strategy for biogas production continuous stirred tank reactor cstr has been developed for treating high strength waste with accompanying biogas production substrate distribution is uniform throughout the reactor the main advantages of using cstr include that reaction kinetics could be improved by vigorous mixing therefore it can be operated with a comparatively short hydraulic retention time 12 as high suspended solids and relatively high viscosity of pome cstr is perfectly suitable for pome treatment besides the plug flow reactor pfr is used in a variety of biogas plants physically similar to an anaerobic baffled reactor abr or up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb 16 most biogas plants of palm oil mills have a channel digester therefore in this study a typical channel digester was modified to anaerobic horizontal baffled channel ahbc reactor the ahbc reactor mentioned above designed in this study does not require mechanical mixing is suitable for operation under high organic loading conditions and a long hrt and has a relatively low construction cost two stage ad of pome has been reported for using different operating conditions and bioreactor combinations 1 7 17 20 the efficiency of pome degradation was investigated in the uasb reactor and cstr using two stage thermophilic and mesophilic fermentation 18 18 19 20 total energy recovery equivalent to 661 02 mj m3 pome was achieved from a semi continuous stirred tank reactor scstr for a two stage ad of pome 7 furthermore hydrogen and methane yields of 210 and 315 ml g cod respectively were achieved at an organic loading rate olr of 60 and 6 g cod l d in anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr and uasb however the approach used in the study cited above required external nutrients iron nitrogen and phosphorus supplementation 1 to the best of our knowledge there remains questions of kinetic parameters and the process may be impractical in an industrial scale treatment system the characteristic of pome varies depending on the production process and oil recovery efficiencies therefore the first objective of this study was to investigate the bhp and bmp of various initial organic loading and to evaluate how much energy recovery from pome could be enhanced by thermophilic mesophilic two stage ad the bhp and bmp results achieved could be more proper for the further preliminary design of the two stage ad process for the factory which provided pome for this investigation the second objective was to evaluate and monitor biohydrogen production in the first stage hydrolysis and acidogenesis of a two stage anaerobic digestion process from pome in cstr reactor under thermophilic conditions and methane production in the second stage mainly acetogenesis and methanogenesis of a two stage anaerobic digestion process using effluent from the first stage as a substrate in an ahbc reactor under ambient conditions without additional supplements 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic seed sludge and substrate anaerobic seed sludge for hydrogen production was obtained from a lab scale continuous stirred tank reactor cstr producing hydrogen by co fermentation of skim latex serum sls and pome 21 before use the anaerobic seed sludge was acclimated with pome under thermophilic temperature 55 c until steady hydrogen production anaerobic digester sludge was collected from a mesophilic digester treating pome of palm pattana southern border co ltd pattani thailand and was used as seed sludge for methane production the raw pome was collected from the receiving tank of palm pattana southern border co ltd pattani thailand the temperature of the discharged pome ranged from 75 82 c and the raw pome was an acidic colloidal mixture at ph 4 2 of brown color the pome was characterized see table 1 and kept at 4 c until use 2 2 biohydrogen potential bhp and biomethane potential bmp in batch mode bhp and bmp of two stage ad were determined in batch mode by using 120 ml and 500 ml serum bottles respectively in each bhp bottle comprised of 15 ml of inoculum 15 ml of basic anaerobic ba medium prepared as described by angelidaki and sanders 22 and 30 ml of calculated pome volume balanced with deionized water the mixtures were then purged with n2 100 at 0 5 l min for 5 min to ensure anaerobic conditions before closing with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum clamp triplicate blanks containing distilled water inoculums and ba medium were also processed positive controls were carried out using brown sugar at initial loading of 0 67 g cod 11 2 g cod l when hydrogen production reached a steady state the mixture was transferred into a 500 ml serum bottle which contained 140 ml seed sludge for the bmp test at that bottle was purged with nitrogen gas before closing with butyl rubber stopper and aluminum clamp the bhp and bmp were determined at thermophilic 55 3 c and ambient temperatures 30 3 c respectively the produced biogas volumes and compositions were measured daily the bmp of single stage ad process was determined for comparison the different initial pome loadings of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 g cod respectively were tested to investigate the effects of organic loading on bhp and bmp statistically significant differences in biogas production were determined using a one way analysis of variance anova in spss v26 0 ibm usa 2 3 reactor set up and operation continuous hydrogen and methane production using a two stage ad process had a cstr in the first stage for hydrogen production and an ahbc reactor in the second stage for methane production fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental set up for continuous hydrogen and methane production in this study the apparatus had two main parts the first for hydrogen production included an influent tank for mixing raw pome the cstr reactor 1 35 l working and an effluent tank one liter of acclimated anaerobic seed sludge and 0 35 l of pome were first placed in the cstr and to ensure anaerobic conditions the system was purged with nitrogen gas at 2 l min for 10 min the reactor was initially started in batch mode for 48 h with temperature control in order to acclimatize the inoculum the reactor was then operated in cstr mode at 55 c continuously stirred with a magnetic bar at 150 rpm temperature controlled by water circulation in a jacket over the reactor and hydraulic retention time hrt ranged from 1 to 7 days due to the relatively small scale of the cstr the substrate was fed twice daily with a peristaltic pump at 5 ml min for the set substrate volume corresponding to the desired hrt the ph of raw pome was adjusted to 6 7 with 5 g nahco3 l pome before feeding to the cstr to keep an effluent ph of about 5 0 6 0 the hrt was decreased when the system reached a steady state hydrogen content biogas volume and ph all varied by less than 10 relative standard deviation rsd the biogas produced was measured while the biogas composition was analyzed daily with liquid samples taken every 24 h from the effluent overflow when the substrate was fed to analyze for ph and volatile fatty acids the second stage for methane production was carried out in a transparent acrylic ahbc reactor with 8 cm width 65 cm length and 18 cm height 9 3 l the above dimensions imitate the biogas plant of palm pattana biogas company the methane production was commenced by feeding 4 9 l of anaerobic digester sludge and 2 1 l of effluent from hydrogen production in the first stage hrt 2 and 3 days as a substrate to the reactor 7 l working volume nitrogen gas at 2 l min was used to purge for 20 min to ensure anaerobic conditions the reactor was started at hrt 40 days and operated at ambient temperature similar to the cstr operation the effluent from cstr was fed to ahbc reactor twice daily at 5 ml min for the volume corresponding to the set hrt the effect of hrt at 80 60 40 and 35 days respectively on the methane production was investigated during fermentation the system was mechanically mixed by liquid circulation using a peristaltic pump at 0 2 l min the biogas produced was measured and the biogas composition was analyzed daily with liquid samples taken every 24 h from the effluent overflow when the substrate was fed to analyze for the ph value the effluent at hrt 35 days at a steady state was sampled to analyze for the volatile fatty acids 2 4 analytical methods the volume of biogas production was recorded by using water displacement the volume of gas produced in blank was subtracted from the volume produced in substrate fermentation before expressing as bhp or bmp the biogas composition was measured using a gas chromatography gc shimadzu gc 14a shimadzu corp kyoto japan equipped with a stainless steel column 2 m packed with molecular sieve 58 80 100 mesh and a thermal conductivity detector tcd each sample of biogas 0 5 ml was injected into the gc with argon as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 35 ml min the gc column injection port oven and detector all set at a temperature of 100 c liquid samples were taken at designated times for further analysis of volatile fatty acid vfa using high performance liquid chromatography hplc hp 1100 hewlett packard germany equipped with pinnacle ii c18 column and ultraviolet uv detector at 210 nm the high performance liquid chromatography was performed using the following conditions 2 5 mm h2so4 was used as mobile phase at 0 8 ml min flow rate and 45 c oven temperature the liquor samples were first centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and then filtered through with a 0 45 μm nylon membrane ph cod total solids ts volatile solids vs oil and grease and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn were determined following the procedures described in the standard methods 15 the microbial communities in both h2 and ch4 reactors were characterized using the methods described in a previous study by jariyaboon et al 24 2 5 kinetic model analysis for batch fermentation models for describing and predicting the kinetics of anaerobic digestion include the cone model eq 1 a first order kinetic model eq 2 and the dual pool first order kinetic model eq 3 25 the models mentioned above were used to fit the cumulative hydrogen and methane production obtained from

microsoft excel 2010 with a solver add in program microsoft usa was used to determine the kinetic parameters the correlation coefficients r2 were also obtained 2 6 kinetic model analysis for continuous fermentation for a continuous process the material balance at steady state of biogas production in cstr and ahbc reactor can be written as eq 4 4 v 0 c v 0 c 0 v r r c where v0 is the substrate flow rate c and c0 are the average inlet and outlet cods at steady state vr is working volume and rc is cod removal rate which can be expressed by first order kinetics shown in eq 5 5 r c k

characteristics of pome are shown in table 1 the pome had high concentrations of total solids ts volatile solids vs and high chemical oxygen demand cod at 50 40 and 78 g l respectively indicating concentrated not diluted wastewater thus the pome should be treated before discharge in order to prevent water pollution the high 703 mg l total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn showed a high protein content in the pome c n ratio of 27 59 for this pome was below the optimum c n ratio for hydrogen production taken as 74 as reported by o thong et al 26 low c n ratio reflects high nitrogen content and could evolve ammonia which would adversely affect the activity of microorganisms however the c n ratio 27 58 is suited for methane production in the second stage of a two stage ad a suitable ph for hydrogen producing bacteria is between 5 0 6 0 14 thus there is a need to adjust the ph of pome before feeding into the cstr nahco3 was used to increase the ph of inlet pome while alkalinity was also increased to improve buffering capacity and balance the ph during hydrogen production 3 2 biohydrogen and methane potential of pome batch mode the cumulative hydrogen production from thermophilic dark fermentation at the pome loadings of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 g cod respectively is shown in fig 2 a hydrogen production was observed on the first day of fermentation for all pome loadings a positive control using brown sugar provided the highest hydrogen volume since sugar is the most rapidly fermentable substrate this indicates good activities of the microorganisms used the cumulative hydrogen volume with 1 0 g cod loading was higher than 0 5 g cod as more substrate was available for microorganisms consumption however the hydrogen production decreased when pome loading was 1 5 g cod indicating overloading and or toxic effects from vfa accumulation which lead to a decrease in the ph the initial and final phs of batch fermentation were also monitored the production of bio hydrogen occurred in the acidification phase which decreased the ph of the fermentation the ph decreased from 6 0 to 4 9 5 5 to 4 9 and 5 3 to 4 5 when 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 g cod respectively were loaded as mentioned the optimum ph range for hydrogen production using dark fermentation is 5 0 6 0 thus the 1 5 g cod loadings of pome fermentation which had the most ph was lower than the optimum range achieved from the lowest hydrogen production vfas profile of the fermentation which can be used to estimate the metabolic reaction route is illustrated in fig 2b the highest vfas in the fermentation of about 12 g l at the end of fermentation was found with the initial 1 5 g cod loadings wang et al 27 reported that the activity of methanogenic bacteria was inhibited to a significant extent when the total vfas concentration was above 10 0 g l this inhibitory effect weakened when the vfas concentration reduced to 6 2 8 5 g l at the end of hydrogen production the acid forming bacteria fermented glucose and produced vfas such as acetic butyric propionic and lactic acids according to eqs 8 12 8 acetic acid and butyric acid production favored the production of hydrogen and the acetic acid pathway gave the highest theoretical hydrogen yield in contrast propionic and lactic acid pathways do not generate hydrogen this can explain why the fermentation with 1 5 g cod loadings produced the least hydrogen despite the most total vfas 8 c 6 h 12 o 6 2 h 2 o 2c h 3 cooh 2c o 2 4 h 2 δ g 0 251 7 kj mol 9 3 c 6 h 12 o 6 4c h 3 c h 2 cooh 2c h 3 cooh 2c o 2 2 h 2 o δ g 0 311 2 kj mol 10 c 6 h 12 o 6 c 3 h 7

acid producing bacteria were the main microorganisms in the raw pome while lactic acid was the main vfa in the final fermentation broth a summary of hydrogen yield based on cod is shown in table 2 the maximum hydrogen production yield of 106 13 ml h2 g codadded which is approximately 20 49 of the theoretical value was obtained with 0 5 g cod initial loading additionally the highest hydrogen yield obtained in this study corresponding to 8 2 l h2 l pome initial loading of 8 33 g cod l is higher than 6 5 l h2 l pome which was obtained from the higher initial loading of 64 g cod l reported in the study of o thong et al 26 methane production from the second stage of the two stage ad process using the effluent from the first stage dark fermentation and the single stage ad using raw pome is shown in fig 3 a and b respectively for various initial pome concentrations less than 1 day of lag phase was observed for all batches of methane production 230 99 m l ch4 equating to 344 18 ml ch4 g codadded 88 of the theoretical yield was obtained from the fermentation using brown sugar this indicates that the microorganism used in this batch experiments had good activities vfas in the effluent from the first stage are substrates for acetogens that convert vfas to acetic acid the substrate for methanogens to produce methane the ph at the end of two stage fermentation was 7 3 7 5 indicating that the vfas were consumed thus the two stage ad at all initial loading provides more massive methane production than the single stage ad the maximum methane production yield of 334 56 m l ch4 g codadded which is approximately 86 23 of the theoretical value was obtained with the lowest pome input at 0 5 g cod the ph for the single stage ad was also measured and it was found that the initial ph ranged between 7 3 7 5 which is similar to the ph after fermentation 7 3 7 4 due to ph during the fermentation in this study was not monitored the fluctuation of ph thus was not observed however to better understand the ph dynamics during the fermentation which influences the process efficiencies the measurement of ph during fermentation is suggested energy production corresponding to hydrogen and methane produced is shown in table 2 it can be seen that the highest overall energy yield of 13 61 kj g codadded was achieved at 0 5 g cod initial loading in the two stage ad the two stage ad has a higher potential to recover energy from the warm raw pome than the single stage ad energy recovered from the two stage ad is 38 95 higher than the energy generated in the single stage ad however the higher pome loading at which inhibition could appear is more significant and a lower energy recovery yield is possible cod distributions of all the batch experiments were calculated to demonstrate the material balance during fermentation this is given in table 3 the basis of calculations was the pome input expressed in terms of mg cod the output streams include the product gas phase and the remnants in the fermentation bottle the remaining fraction was analyzed for fatty acids and other components which were cell mass unfermented long chain fatty acids carbohydrate protein and lignin the overall cod removal by two stage ad at pome loadings 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 g cod were 87 64 83 01 and 48 83 respectively while the single stage ad were 68 13 65 28 and 39 39 respectively 3 3 estimation of kinetic model constants for batch fermentation table 4 summarizes the results of the kinetic study for batch experiments using the cone model a first order kinetic model and the dual pool first order kinetic model according to the results all the tested models provided a reasonable fit to the experimental data this is confirmed by the r2 value which was higher than 0 92 the cone model and the dual pool first order kinetic model with the higher r2 are observed as more appropriate than the first order kinetic model this is reconfirmed by the plot of measured and predicted methane yields in fig 4 there was approximately 3 3 times higher concentration of organic loading in the bhp test which caused inhibition by the high strength pome especially at the 1 5 g cod loading thus the biochemical reaction might not follow first order kinetics as seen in table 4 from the low r2 values the experimental results of bhp at the initial pome loading of 1 5 g cod did not fit well with any of the models used in this study other more complex kinetic models with inhibition effects could be further tested the rate constant k of the substrates determined from the cone model varied in the range 0 008 0 73 1 d which was 14 69 higher than those obtained from the first order model this finding is similar to the values reported by nguyen et al 25 methane production rate constants at 1 0 g cod were higher than at 0 5 g cod and 1 5 g cod loading both single stage ad and two stage ad this indicates that the systems were satisfied at 1 0 g cod while at a higher organic loading there was inhibition as mentioned in the previous section it can be further observed that the rate constant of methane production in two stage ad was higher than in single stage ad which reconfirmed the advantage of two stage ad the predicted hydrogen potentials from the fitted models were slightly higher than the values obtained experimentally this might be because the fermentation to produce hydrogen were ceased at 8 days which did not yet reach the highest bio hydrogen potential for methane production the predicted potentials from the first order model were slightly lower than the experimental ones in contrast to the prediction using the cone model similar results on methane production were previously reported by dennehy et al 28 the dual pool first order model was selected to evaluate the kinetic constant in this investigation the reason for selecting the dual pool first order model is because it was developed for two distinct methane generation periods 29 which is similar to the profiles of cumulative production shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively however the solver tool with a non linear regression method was used for kinetic constant fitting and the results are based on the best fitted values the α is the fraction of a rapidly degradable substrate in this study α varied within 0 41 0 74 although pome was the only substrate used this indicates that even though the obtained r2 value obtained signifies that the predicted model was fitted correctly to the experimental data there are still doubts regarding the use of these regression results for pome fermentation hence as the r2 and mm for the cone model appear the most reasonable to describe the biochemical reaction the kinetic constants for this simple model could be the most appropriate to use in further scale up of pome treatment by the anaerobic digestion process 3 4 continuous biohydrogen production in cstr the biohydrogen production rate and yield observed from cstr reactor are shown in fig 5 a and table 5 the results found that in the initial hrt operation hydrogen production was observed from the first day indicating that the acidogenic bacteria in cstr reactor had a good activity level however stable hydrogen production was only attained after 10 days the average hydrogen production rate at a steady state was 0 36 l h2 l reactor d which corresponds to a hydrogen yield of 33 62 ml h2 g codadded for hrt 7 days the average hydrogen production rate increased to 1 46 and 2 18 l h2 l reactor d which correspond to hydrogen yields of 57 33 and 86 00 ml h2 g cod respectively when hrt was reduced to 5 and 3 days respectively when the hrt was further decreased to 2 and 1 day the average hydrogen production rate increased to 2 65 and 5 04 l h2 l reactor d however the average hydrogen yield decreased to 66 15 or 64 50 ml h2 g codadded with hrt at 7 and 5 days low hydrogen production rates and hydrogen yields were achieved at long hrt the substrate for growing hydrogen producing bacteria was limited meanwhile at a limited 2 and 1 day hrt excess substrate was fed and subsequently caused accumulation of hydrogen partial pressure and volatile free fatty acids consequently hydrogen producing bacteria in the system were inhibited moreover oil and grease in the substrate might also inhibit and contribute to low hydrogen yield 30 in order to test the reactor performance after the operation at hrt of 1 day the substrate feed rate was decreased to hrt of 3 days and the average hydrogen rate and hydrogen production yield were similar to hrt of 3 days in phase iii volatile free fatty acids vfas were produced simultaneously with hydrogen fig 5b the distributions of vfas in the soluble metabolite at steady state biohydrogen production were 10 6 14 8 14 2 11 8 and 12 6 g total vfas l with respective hrts of 7 5 3 2 and 1 day lactic acid was the main vfa in the original pome an increase in lactic acid was observed only in hrt of 7 days while in the other cases lactic acid decreased lactic acid can be converted via lactate fermentation pathway which produces hydrogen or via lactic oxidation pathway to produce small molecule vfas as shown in eqs 13 and 14 31 13 2 c h 3 chohcooh 2 h 2 o 2 c h 3 cooh 2hc o 3 4 h 2 δ g 0 3 95 kj mol 14 2 c h 3 chohcooh 2 c h 3 cooh 2 c h 3 c h 2 cooh hc o 3 h δ g 0 3 95 kj mol daily ph of cstr influent and effluent are plotted in fig 5c the effluent ph was maintained within 5 0 5 5 which is suitable for hydrogen producing bacteria 32 33 this indicates that nahco3 at 5 g nahco3 l pome 0 066 g nahco3 g cod was sufficient to keep the ph of the effluent in the preferred range in this study hydrogen yield was lower than the one reported by mamimin et al 1 their study focused on the continuous hydrogen production under thermophilic conditions with 2 days hrt with an organic loading rate olr of 60 g cod l d in anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr they found a hydrogen yield of 210 m l h2 g codadded 326 4 m l h2 g vs however the raw pome was supplemented with fe2 na2hpo4 2h2o and peptone to reach the optimal c n and c p ratios in contrast no external supplement was added aside from nahco3 for ph control in this current study moreover the asbr used in the study could retain more biomass concentration than the cstr used in our study 3 5 continuous biomethane production in ahbc reactor the methane production in the second stage methanogenic fermentation of the two stage anaerobic digestion process from the effluent from hydrogen production in the first stage acidogenic fermentation was evaluated fig 6 a shows the methane production rate with different hrts in phase i startup the system was operated at hrt of 40 days and no methane was detected in the first 5 days then on the 6th day the ch4 production rate of 80 m l ch4 l reactor d was detected after which the methane production rate sharply increased until the 12th day typically acidogenic bacteria grow faster than acetogenic and methanogenic microorganisms so the consumption rate of vfas was below their production rate and the vfas accumulated reducing ph which reduced methanogen activity an attempt to operate with 40 days hrt was carried out for 10 days more however the ch4 production rate was not improved then twice higher hrt 80 days or lower olr in order to let the microorganism more acclimate was used in phase ii the results showed that ch4 yield increased and became nearly constant within 22 days corresponding to an increased ph in the broth fig 6b this indicates that at this feed rate the system released vfas slowly without inhibiting methanogen activity so vfas and other substrates h2 co2 could be consumed to produce methane and also the biomass population increased therefore the lower 60 days hrt was tested in phase iii to assess the ch4 reactor performance the results show that ch4 production slightly increased to 300 m l ch4 l reactor d a higher feed rate was operated at hrt 40 days phase iv and as expected the methane production rate increased to around 500 ml ch4 l reactor d the performance was then tested at a lower hrt of 35 days in phase v there was no observed significant increase in methane production in this phase at a steady state of 35 day hrt operation a 527 m l ch4 l reactor d production rate was obtained with a yield of 250 33 m l ch4 g codadded equating to 18 4 m l ch4 l pome cod distribution in the continuous two stage ad process of pome in cstr and ahbc reactor is shown in table 6 in cstr at hrt of 3 days 5 40 of cod input was converted to hydrogen and removed from the reactor while for ahbc reactor operated at hrt of 35 days 21366 98 g cod d of methane were produced equating to 60 87 of initial cod loading the overall cod removal in this process was 66 27 demonstrating that cod was remaining in the ahbc reactor effluent and further treatment would be needed the first order kinetic constants kc of continuous hydrogen and methane production in cstr and ahbc reactor respectively were calculated using eq 7 and are presented in table 5 it was observed that kc for hydrogen production ranged within 0 016 0 03 which is about 10 times less than that obtained from the batch process the kc for methane production at hrt 35 days is 0 052 which is near k 0 1 calculated by using the first order model at pome loading 1 5 g cod in the batch process continuous fermentation provided a relatively low production rate and yield compared to the batch process due to no external nutrient addition moreover mixing effects on biocatalyst performance flow and transport phenomena on different scales influence the kinetic behavior of the cells the ideal case of a completely mixed tank can be approximated on a small laboratory scale to consider the conditions in industrial scale reactors bulk circulation patterns in a large scale reactor carry the cells into different regions of the reactor typically having different turbulence levels and dead zones or wash out might occur also in continuous fermentation the substrate characteristics vary more than in batch fermentation 3 6 microbial community the microbial communities of inoculums for hydrogen and methane production by two stage ad in cstr and ahbc reactors were analyzed by pcr dgge and are shown in fig 7 the strong band intensity indicates the dominance of microbial communities mainly clostridium sp enterobacter sp lactobacillus sp and pelotomaculum sp were identified in the cstr reactor fig 7a clostridium sp and enterobacter sp are known for hydrogen production by fermentation and they are obligate and facultative mesophilic anaerobes respectively with favorable conditions to produce hydrogen at ph 5 0 6 0 and 32 40 c 34 35 clostridium sp is present in most hydrogen production systems and can be found in thermophilic conditions this species is applied to treat various kinds of carbohydrates and can degrade phenols 36 lactobacillus sp present in the hydrogen production stage is lactate producers 37 in the presence of oil lactic acid bacteria become one of the significant strains of microflora thermophilic lactobacillus sp can be used to improve or recover digester systems from sour digestion conditions such as higher than normal loadings 38 this corresponds to the high lactic concentration in fermentation broth observed at high pome loading as mentioned earlier in section 3 2 the lactic acid producing pathway in eq 11 does not generate hydrogen which in this study reduced the hydrogen yield below the theoretically calculated based on the acetic producing pathway pelotomaculum sp is a strictly anaerobic and thermophilic organism and can oxidize propionate lactate or several alcohols at 45 65 c optimum 55 c and the ph range for its growth is 6 7 7 5 optimum 7 0 the presence of pelotomaculum sp indicates that saccharide oxidation to propionic occurred in the second stage microbacterium sp and proteiniphilum sp were the dominant bacteria in methane production meanwhile methanocorpusculum sp and methanothrix sp fig 7b were the dominant archaea both of which are acetoclastic methanogens producing methane 39 carillo et al 40 reported that methanocorpusculum labreanum was the most evident archeal found in methane production producing ch4 from h2 and co2 or acting as formate donors at optimal growth temperatures 36 42 c and ph 7 0 8 0 methanothrix sp is also found in mesophilic sewage digesters with an optimum temperature for growth and methane formation at 37 c and an optimal ph range of between 7 4 7 8 39 3 7 perspective for hydrogen and methane recovery from pome table 7 presents a comparison of single stage ad and two stage ad process performances on using pome as a substrate in this study against previous studies methane and energy production of single stage ad in this study had a higher significance when compared with wong et al 41 and chan et al 42 due to a higher olr feed in these studies some previous studies reported a higher methane production than this current study possibly due to different operating conditions abdurahman et al 43 showed that an anaerobic membrane reactor mas demonstrated high performance for decomposing all particulate matter in pome raw pome supplemented with iron nitrogen and phosphorus gave higher biogas yield 1 for the two stage ad process this investigation achieved higher production yield but lower production rate than the one reported by krishnan et al 19 who loaded pome at a high olr the higher energy yield reported by mamimin et al 1 krishnan et al 19 and o thong et al 17 were probably due to the supplementation with iron peptone and na2hpo4 the use of thermophilic conditions 55 c in the second stage anaerobic digestion reported by seengenyoung et al 44 could lead to a higher biogas yield moreover the performance of a full scale biogas plant from pome of palm pattana southern border co ltd pattani thailand is also listed in table 7 the total volume of biogas plant is 12 000 m3 pfr operates at an olr of 2 34 g cod l d under ambient temperature and produces biogas containing 45 55 methane with a biogas production rate of 0 44 l biogas l d methane yield of 186 11 m l ch4 g codadded and energy yield of 6 24 kj g codadded internal mixing by liquid recirculation applied in ahbr reactor in this study might lead to a higher yield of methane production than the one from the factory the ahbr reactor was modified based on the dimensions of the full scale biogas plant therefore the implementation of internal mixing to the pome digester might enhance methane production yield moreover the methane reactor used in this study was fed with the acidogenetic effluent which has been proven to be a more favorable substrate than raw pome and this might have caused the higher methane production yield the results from this study also obviously indicate that adding the dark fermentation reactor for hydrogen production before the conventional biogas production could improve energy recovery and cod removal further downstream processing of anaerobic digestion is required for their beneficial use or safe disposal mixed hydrogen and methane biohythane production in this study gave about 46 47 ch4 12 16 h2 and 36 41 co2 respectively moreover there are also other trace components such as h2s around 3000 4000 ppm 45 h2s content in the biogas needs to be removed by biological physical or chemical methods to prevent corrosion problems currently most palm oil mills in thailand use bioscrubber for upgrading biogas before feeding to biogas generator 45 the utilization of hydrogen containing biogas has been reported to improve the combustion efficiency in a gas engine 46 microalgae and macroalgae are potential candidates for bioremediation of anaerobically treated pome due to their ability to assimilate the contaminants which for them are growth nutrients 47 49 moreover pome digestate is also the primary product and after dewatering the biosolid has the potential to be used as an organic fertilizer 50 despite the happenings in thailand where the single stage ad of pome is generally preferred implementing the dark fermentation instead the pome cooling pond is an approach that ensures significant improvements micolucci et al 33 observed that the two stage reactor using food waste as a substrate has a net 55 higher energy production compared with the single stage reactor the payback time for introducing a fermenter is less than 1 5 years indicating that adding a system for the first anaerobic digestion of pome might be worthwhile the ahbc reactor in this study was modified based on the typical bioreactor mostly used for pome treatment in thailand the reactor performances of continuous processes were also explored with a kinetic analysis therefore it can be concluded that the information retrieved from this article is quite suitable for further scaling up economic and environmental analysis these preliminary results should be driven further by research to better understand the conditions that can drive the two stage ad for treating pome to have higher performance and energy recovery 4 conclusions this work revealed that 38 95 more energy could be recovered from pome using two stage ad than with the conventional single stage ad process the impact of hrt 7 5 3 2 and 1 days was investigated for the continuous hydrogen production in a cstr when the lower hrts were operated the higher production rates were obtained the higher hydrogen production yield was achieved when the lower hrt was fed however the hydrogen productions were dropped when the hrt lower than 3 days was applied the maximum productivity of 5 04 l h2 l reactor d was achieved at hrt of 1 i day while the maximum hydrogen production yield of 86 m l h2 g codadded was obtained at hrt of 3 days the methane production in an ahbc reactor was investigated at hrt of 35 days 0 53 l ch4 l reactor d was achieved with an overall cod removal efficiency cstr ahbc of 66 27 this work also revealed a strategy to efficiently operate continuous hydrogen and methane production from pome by using a buffer nahco3 to maintain the system

13691,the process of the anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox has been successfully used to remove nitrogen from reject water after dewatering of the digested sewage sludge however it is also used on other types of wastewater including industrial wastewater which may contain substances that inhibit this process examples of such substances include heavy metals which may be found in tanning wastewater landfill leachate or coke oven wastewater the study presented shows the influence of two different mixtures of heavy metals on the anammox process in a long term test in sbr1 a mixture of nickel ni2 copper cu2 and zinc zn2 was tested while in sbr3 a mixture of chromium cr3 cadmium cd2 and lead pb2 was checked whereas the sbr2 reactor was a control reactor the study demonstrated that even the highest levels of chromium cadmium and lead tested did not inhibit the process however in the case of the second metal mixture strong inhibition of the nitrogen removal efficiency was observed it was shown that zinc is the metal that was predominantly responsible for the inhibition and its elimination from the incoming sewage allowed to restore the initial efficiency of the process keywords anammox start up nitrogen removal sbr wastewater treatment heavy metals 1 introduction heavy metals are being increasingly discharged into the environment especially when contained in industrial wastewater 1 at low concentrations heavy metals constitute essential microelements for the proper functioning of cells and key enzymes they can even stimulate bacterial activity for example such ions as cu ii zn ii co ii fe ii mn ii and ni ii are vital co factors in a wide range of metalloproteins and key enzymes in the anammox biochemistry 2 however their excessive presence in wastewater could be inhibitory wastewater treatment plants wwtps can retain most heavy metals preventing them from being discharged into the environment 3 however their presence in wastewater can have negative consequences for the wastewater treatment as they can easily deteriorate the microbial activity in wastewater treatment plants 4 heavy metals can bind to enzymes and disrupt enzymatic structures 5 6 causing the inactivation of biochemical pathways 7 heavy metals can also accumulate in bacterial cells due to their fast and relatively non specific transport systems 8 9 and cause the microbial community depletion 10 11 increasing nutrient pollution and continuous deterioration of water environment over the last two decades has attracted more attention from the scientific community and has resulted in the implementation of modern wastewater treatment processes the most promising technology that has been developed in recent years is the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process considered as efficient and environment friendly 10 12 there are currently more than 100 full scale anammox treatment plants most of them are used for the treatment of reject waters however other types of wastewater such as landfill leachate 13 coke oven wastewater 14 15 swine and pharmaceutical wastewater 16 have been the subject matter of scientific research as well anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aaob are sensitively affected by many environmental factors present in industrial wastewater such as antibiotics alcohols aldehydes phenols sulphides nanoparticles and heavy metals 10 17 18 19 20 51 22 especially while treating low ammonia streams and at low temperatures 200 mg nl 1 20ºc 23 cecen et al 24 and shu et al 1 showed that such metals as copper zinc and iron are the major ones that can be found in industrial wastewater although it has been confirmed that high concentrations of heavy metals can have an adverse effect on biological processes only a few researchers havefocused on the effect of these inhibitors on the anammox process 18 19 25 30 zhang et al 21 showed for example that zn ii can significantly reduce the process performance zhang et al 21 pointed out that cd ii exhibited both the acute and persistent toxicity on the anammox biomass and reduced nitrogen removal by more than 94 in the long term most current scientific experiments focus on the effect of individual heavy metals on the anammox process under short term exposure conditions 21 31 some of them reported a positive 32 or adverse 17 effect on the nitrogen removal efficiency several factors influence heavy metal inhibitions the type of sludge the exposure mode long term or short term temperature or ph which significantly affects the availability of metals 33 in the case of the two stage anammox process it is preceded by a partial nitrification process it can therefore be expected that this process will be primarily influenced by heavy metals however it is very difficult to determine whether nitrifiers are more or less sensitive to heavy metals especially if we consider the very wide range of concentrations that cause inhibition 7 33 besides in some cases stimulation of the aob activity can even be expected 34 another aspect is the loading rates of metals which will be different in the case of partial nitrification and the anammox process therefore it is also important to determine the effect of heavy metals on the anammox process itself hence the main goals of this research were a to investigate the effect of two different mixtures of heavy metals contained in synthetic wastewater with low ammonia concentrations on the anammox process b to compare the effect of heavy metals on the anammox process in continuously operating sequencing batch reactors sbr c to attempt to adapt the anammox bacteria to heavy metals d to determine the effect of heavy metals on the bacterial population 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup for the long term effect evaluation three sequencing batch bioreactors including a control one worked for 260 days to investigate the long term effects of heavy metals on the anammox process sbrs were made of pvc and their total volume was 15 l 10 l of working volume the medium was a modified synthetic medium based on trigo et al 35 deprived of the presence of calcium ions due to their high content in tap water and the average load of the reactors with nitrogen was 0 2 kg n m 3d 1 all the three reactors were inoculated with the anammox biomass from a laboratory sbr treating real reject water initially all the three reactors were operating on the same medium without the addition of heavy metals for the first 85 days start up period the reactor scheme is shown in fig 1 sbrs worked in 4 cycles per day each consisting of 70 min of inflow 235 min of reaction time 10 min of sedimentation 35 min of draining and 10 min of the idle phase detailed parameters for all the three reactors are presented in table 1 two reactors were used to study the effect of various heavy metal ion mixtures on the anammox process in sbr1 a mixture of nickel ni2 copper cu2 and zinc zn2 was tested while in sbr3 a mixture of chromium cr3 cadmium cd2 and lead pb2 was checked whereas the sbr2 reactor was a control reactor the following salts were used as the source of heavy metal ions crcl3 6h2o pbcl2 cu no3 2 3h2o nicl2 6h2o and zncl2 the experiment was divided into five periods during which the metal concentrations were successively increased the metal concentrations in each period are shown in table 2 the initial concentrations of the heavy metals were selected according to a previous analysis of heavy metals concentration in industrial wastewater in poland in wastewater coming into municipal wastewater treatment plants 2 2 analytical methods regular measurements of ammonium nitrite nitrate nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand cod were conducted by means of fast photometric tests merck millipore methods no 1 14752 1 14776 1 09713 1 14541 for nh4 n no2 n no3 n and cod respectively with a photometer merck spectroquant nova60 furthermore measurements of total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were performed once a week for physical parameters ph and temperature a wtw 340i ph multimeter was used tss and vss measurements were performed in accordance with the apha standard method apha 2012 2 3 bacteriological material sampling dna extraction and pcr analysis activated sludge samples from the sbr reactors were collected to 50 ml sterile falcon tubes and kept at 20 c until the dna isolation genetic material was isolated from the samples by means of a mechanical method 36 and stored at 20 c until further procedure two 16s rrna coding gene pcr products for the total community and for the anammox bacteria were obtained based on the total bacterial dna isolated from the samples the first amplicon for the total bacteria community monitoring was obtained with 338f gc and 518r primers ca 180 bp 37 and the second amplicon for the anammox 16s rrna coding gene was obtained with 368f gc and 820r ca 350 bp 38 they underwent the denturing gradient electrophoretic separation dgge in the dcode universal mutation detection system biorad the polyacrylamide gel 8 37 5 1 acrylamide bisacrylamide fluka was prepared with a gradient of the 30 60 denaturant urea and formamide according to the manufacturer s instruction the gel was run for 3 h at 120 v in a 1 tae buffer tris acetic acid edta ph 8 0 at a constant temperature of 60 c the gel was stained with sybr gold 1 10 000 invitrogen in miliq water for 15 min and distained in miliq water for 15 min then visualised under the uv light and photographed using the quantity one 1d software biorad the analysis of dgge fingerprints was performed using the quantity one 1d software biorad and shannon and simpson biodiversity indices were calculated for the samples 39 dna bands well separated from the rest of the fingerprint were cut off the gel and underwent sequencing using the abi prism 377 sequencer in order to identify the dominant genotypes the obtained sequences were compared with the genbank ncbi sequences by means of blast 3 results and discussion three sbr reactors were used to assess the long term effect of selected heavy metals on the anammox process in the period of work and work stabilisation before the proper tests the average efficiency of nitrogen removal in the system was 80 06 5 99 81 04 4 28 and 81 06 3 68 whereas the average rate of nitrogen removal was 0 157 0 03 0 161 0 02 and 0 160 0 02 g n l 1 d 1 for the sbr reactors 1 2 and 3 respectively 3 1 sbr performance under the long term stress of zinc nickel and copper after the start up period on day 86 of the test two different mixtures of three heavy metal salts were added to the inflow of the sbr 1 and sbr 3 reactors table 2 after adding zn cu and ni to the sbr 1 a slight increase in the nitrite concentration up to 1 5 mg l 1 was observed the average nitrogen removal efficiency dropped to 70 6 which was mainly associated with an increase in the activity of nitrite oxidising bacteria nob during this period the nitrates formed to nitrogen removed ratio increased to 0 25 0 02 from 0 12 0 04 in the start up period however the introduction of metals is not a reason for this because the same effect was observed in the control reactor and the increase in the nob activity was even greater the nitrates formed to nitrogen removed ratio increased to 0 29 0 05 from 0 15 0 03 in the start up period 34 days after adding heavy metals to the inflow and with no other adverse effects the concentration of heavy metal ions increased to 0 8 0 075 0 04 mg l 1 for zn cu and ni respectively in the third period within 30 days of period iii the rate and efficiency of nitrogen removal in the sbr1 reactor dropped sharply from 0 134 g n l 1 d 1 and 70 4 to 0 07 gnl 1 d 1 and 42 1 on day 151 of the study fig 3 at the same time the nitrite concentration increased to 7 mg l 1 and subsequently to 11 mg l 1 fig 2 b besides a significant increase in the ratio of nitrates to removed nitrogen was noted which increased to 0 38 0 21 on average with a maximum value of 0 71 on day 151 at the same time the parameters in the control reactor remained at a similar level as in the second period many authors report that microorganisms from biofilm or activated sludge produce extracellular polymeric substances eps which are a natural barrier that prevents heavy metals from entering cells 3 11 40 42 it seems that this protective ability of epss was sufficient in the second stage of the study however increasing the concentration of metals in the inflow caused a reduction in their ability to protect the cell therefore on day 152 the supply to the sbr1 reactor was turned off for 24 h which was to ensure a decrease in the nitrite concentration in the reactor subsequently based on the research of 2 28 29 and the results of batch tests it was decided to remove zinc in addition the research conducted by song et al 43 shows that zinc oxide is more toxic than other metal oxides such as cuo due to the release of zinc ions from the dissolution of zno which is the main mechanism that inhibits the anammox process considering that zinc was present in the highest concentrations it seemed most likely that it is responsible for inhibiting the process in period iv a slow but stable decrease in the nitrite nitrogen content was observed with a parallel increase in the efficiency of nitrogen removal to almost 66 the ratio of formed nitrates to removed nitrogen also improved and at the end of this period was 0 23 as the reactor operation was stable it was decided to increase the concentration of copper and nickel to 0 225 and 0 12 mg l 1 respectively period v in this period zinc was still not added to the medium since the increase in metal concentrations did not have a negative impact on the reactor s operation which was stable it was decided to add zinc at the concentration of 0 8 mg l 1 to the inflow again on the 210th day of the study this caused a very rapid breakdown of the process the nitrite concentration increased to 56 mg l 1 and the nitrogen removal efficiency dropped to 25 therefore it was again decided to remove zinc from the medium despite this the efficiency of the process could not be restored by the end of the study and on the day 250 the efficiency of nitrogen removal was only 37 such a rapid reaction of the process to the addition of zinc indicates on one hand that zinc is harmful to the anammox process and on the other hand that that it also has a cumulative effect on other metals as the effect of its addition was much more stronger than in period iii 3 2 sbr performance under the long term stress of cadmium chromium and lead a mixture of cadmium lead and chromium ions began to be added to the sbr3 reactor inflow medium from day 86 period ii the initial concentrations of these metals are shown in table 2 they were selected based on the average concentrations for various types of industrial wastewater in the case of chromium it usually occurs as trivalent cr iii and hexavalent cr vi forms in wastewater yu et al 44 reported cr iii did not impose inhibition as its toxicity is much lower than cr vi in the case of long term effects of chromium on anammox bacteria the results showed that the effect of anammox did not change at a low concentration of cr vi i e 0 0 5 mg l 1 but was severely inhibited at 0 8 mg l 1 the inhibition of process activity was mainly due to the significant intracellular reduction of cr vi yu et al 45 in addition jiang et al 2018 31 in their studies showed that during long term operation in the anaerobic flow sludge reactor significant anamox efficiency inhibitory effects were observed for concentrations of cr vi up to 2 mg l 1 hey additionally demonstrated that the tolerance of the anammox process to cr vi can be enhanced after a long term adaptive phase on the other hand chromium ill compounds are stable and occur naturally in the environment although cr iii is less toxic than cr vi long term exposure to a high concentration of cr iii may be toxic hexavalent chromium compounds are found in wastewater in much lower concentrations than trivalent chromium 46 47 the analysis of real wastewater showed that the content of cr iii is 5 10 times higher than cr vi taking into account the toxicity of particular forms the detoxification process consists mainly of the transformation or biotransformation of cr vi to cr iii compounds 48 in the case of the two stage anammox process the first stage is partial nitrification the studies presented by yu et al 45 shows that cr vi is reduced in nitrification systems taking into account very low concentrations of cr vi in the wastewater and additionally the partial nitrification process as a pre application of anammox it was decided to dose only cr iii compounds at the beginning of this research period like in the sbr1 and sbr2 reactors there was a slight decrease in the efficiency of nitrogen removal as compared to the average of 71 5 2 21 which was mainly caused by an increase in the activity of nob bacteria the average ratio of nitrates formed to removed nitrogen increased from 0 12 0 06 in the start up period to 0 25 0 03 in the second period however these values were close to the reference reactor and are not associated with any negative impact of the metals tested therefore on day 120 period iii the concentration of heavy metals in the reactor s feed was doubled as compared to those in the second period on day 137 the nitrite concentration in the reactor suddenly increased to 14 8 mg l 1 fig 2 c however it was associated with the mixer failure to prevent any further negative change the inflow was stopped for 12 h and after replacing the stirrer and restoring the inflow the nitrite concentration dropped below 1 mg l 1 in this period no negative influence of metals on the course of the process was noted the results obtained in the test reactor and the reference reactor were at a similar level fig 3 therefore in period iv the concentration of the tested metals was increased again table 2 on day 180 a slight increase in the nitrite concentration to 5 mg l 1 was observed but no further increase in the nitrite concentration or other negative effects were observed during this period the average nitrogen removal efficiency was 66 19 1 69 and it was comparable to the average nitrogen removal in the reference reactor 66 81 1 11 the low reactor efficiency was mainly due to the activity of nob bacteria as evidenced by the relatively high ratio of nitrate formation to nitrogen removal averaging 0 25 0 03 for the test reactor and 0 27 0 02 for the reference reactor the only visible effect of metals on bacteria was a change in the colour of the sludge in the reference sludge the colour was characteristic for anammox bacteria while in the sludge from sbr 3 the colour was darker black and brown which is probably related to the presence of heavy metals in the cells or their absorption into eps the concentration of all the heavy metals tested was increased again on day 199 period v table 2 however after the subsequent 40 days no negative changes were found and the reactor operating parameters were comparable to those obtained in the earlier periods of the experiment and in the reference reactor at this stage of the study the concentrations of heavy metals in the inlet to the reactor were much higher than those found in municipal wastewater and many types of industrial wastewater 3 3 impact of heavy metals on the microbial diversity in sequencing batch reactors at long term exposure heavy metals are considered to be harmful for microorganisms causing changes in the bacterial communities of activated sludge anammox bacteria are known to be one of the most sensitive groups of microorganisms to check such an impact in the pcr dgge analysis of 16s rrna coding gene amplicons activated sludge samples for pcr amplification were collected on day 85 period i 133 and 147 period iii and 184 period iv the obtained results show that heavy metals do not have any harmful influence on the total bacterial community and the anammox community fig 4 and fig 5 respectively the biodiversity of anammox bacteria is far lower than of the total bacterial community fig 6 and it is shown that the anammox process is performed only by one bacterial genotype fig 5 the genotypes identification based on dna sequencing was inconclusive none of the bands cut off the gel were identified precisely the sequences were the most common to uncultured bacterial clones from activated sludge these results clearly show that the dgge based separated dna bands identification is insufficient for bacterial communities such as activated sludge and that new tools such as next generation sequencing would be more helpful in the community analysis despite dynamic changes in operational conditions both the genotypic structure of the community expressed as fingerprints and the biodiversity indicators are relatively stable which may indicate that the bacteria present in it can resist the influence of heavy metals more effectively 49 4 conclusion continuous tests showed that the mixture of zn2 cu2 and ni2 at concentrations of 0 4 0 0375 and 0 02 mg l 1 corresponding to the doses of 0 59 0 06 and 0 03 mg gvss 1 respectively did not decrease the effectiveness of the anammox process however already twice as high concentrations caused a rapid inhibition of the process it was shown that zinc is the most responsible for the toxic effect its removal from the inflow caused an improvement of the reactor operation it follows that zinc itself is toxic to the anammox bacteria but this effect is further enhanced if it occurs in a mixture with other metals the mixture of cd2 cr3 and pb2 even at the highest concentrations tested did not adversely affect the course of the anammox process 0 008 0 5 and 0 2 mg l 1 respectively corresponding to the dose of 0 02 1 39 0 56 mg gvss 1 respectively did not cause any toxic effect on the anammox process further studies should focus on the examination of join effects of different metal mixtures declaration of competing interest the

13691,the process of the anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox has been successfully used to remove nitrogen from reject water after dewatering of the digested sewage sludge however it is also used on other types of wastewater including industrial wastewater which may contain substances that inhibit this process examples of such substances include heavy metals which may be found in tanning wastewater landfill leachate or coke oven wastewater the study presented shows the influence of two different mixtures of heavy metals on the anammox process in a long term test in sbr1 a mixture of nickel ni2 copper cu2 and zinc zn2 was tested while in sbr3 a mixture of chromium cr3 cadmium cd2 and lead pb2 was checked whereas the sbr2 reactor was a control reactor the study demonstrated that even the highest levels of chromium cadmium and lead tested did not inhibit the process however in the case of the second metal mixture strong inhibition of the nitrogen removal efficiency was observed it was shown that zinc is the metal that was predominantly responsible for the inhibition and its elimination from the incoming sewage allowed to restore the initial efficiency of the process keywords anammox start up nitrogen removal sbr wastewater treatment heavy metals 1 introduction heavy metals are being increasingly discharged into the environment especially when contained in industrial wastewater 1 at low concentrations heavy metals constitute essential microelements for the proper functioning of cells and key enzymes they can even stimulate bacterial activity for example such ions as cu ii zn ii co ii fe ii mn ii and ni ii are vital co factors in a wide range of metalloproteins and key enzymes in the anammox biochemistry 2 however their excessive presence in wastewater could be inhibitory wastewater treatment plants wwtps can retain most heavy metals preventing them from being discharged into the environment 3 however their presence in wastewater can have negative consequences for the wastewater treatment as they can easily deteriorate the microbial activity in wastewater treatment plants 4 heavy metals can bind to enzymes and disrupt enzymatic structures 5 6 causing the inactivation of biochemical pathways 7 heavy metals can also accumulate in bacterial cells due to their fast and relatively non specific transport systems 8 9 and cause the microbial community depletion 10 11 increasing nutrient pollution and continuous deterioration of water environment over the last two decades has attracted more attention from the scientific community and has resulted in the implementation of modern wastewater treatment processes the most promising technology that has been developed in recent years is the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process considered as efficient and environment friendly 10 12 there are currently more than 100 full scale anammox treatment plants most of them are used for the treatment of reject waters however other types of wastewater such as landfill leachate 13 coke oven wastewater 14 15 swine and pharmaceutical wastewater 16 have been the subject matter of scientific research as well anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aaob are sensitively affected by many environmental factors present in industrial wastewater such as antibiotics alcohols aldehydes phenols sulphides nanoparticles and heavy metals 10 17 18 19 20 51 22 especially while treating low ammonia streams and at low temperatures 200 mg nl 1 20ºc 23 cecen et al 24 and shu et al 1 showed that such metals as copper zinc and iron are the major ones that can be found in industrial wastewater although it has been confirmed that high concentrations of heavy metals can have an adverse effect on biological processes only a few researchers havefocused on the effect of these inhibitors on the anammox process 18 19 25 30 zhang et al 21 showed for example that zn ii can significantly reduce the process performance zhang et al 21 pointed out that cd ii exhibited both the acute and persistent toxicity on the anammox biomass and reduced nitrogen removal by more than 94 in the long term most current scientific experiments focus on the effect of individual heavy metals on the anammox process under short term exposure conditions 21 31 some of them reported a positive 32 or adverse 17 effect on the nitrogen removal efficiency several factors influence heavy metal inhibitions the type of sludge the exposure mode long term or short term temperature or ph which significantly affects the availability of metals 33 in the case of the two stage anammox process it is preceded by a partial nitrification process it can therefore be expected that this process will be primarily influenced by heavy metals however it is very difficult to determine whether nitrifiers are more or less sensitive to heavy metals especially if we consider the very wide range of concentrations that cause inhibition 7 33 besides in some cases stimulation of the aob activity can even be expected 34 another aspect is the loading rates of metals which will be different in the case of partial nitrification and the anammox process therefore it is also important to determine the effect of heavy metals on the anammox process itself hence the main goals of this research were a to investigate the effect of two different mixtures of heavy metals contained in synthetic wastewater with low ammonia concentrations on the anammox process b to compare the effect of heavy metals on the anammox process in continuously operating sequencing batch reactors sbr c to attempt to adapt the anammox bacteria to heavy metals d to determine the effect of heavy metals on the bacterial population 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup for the long term effect evaluation three sequencing batch bioreactors including a control one worked for 260 days to investigate the long term effects of heavy metals on the anammox process sbrs were made of pvc and their total volume was 15 l 10 l of working volume the medium was a modified synthetic medium based on trigo et al 35 deprived of the presence of calcium ions due to their high content in tap water and the average load of the reactors with nitrogen was 0 2 kg n m 3d 1 all the three reactors were inoculated with the anammox biomass from a laboratory sbr treating real reject water initially all the three reactors were operating on the same medium without the addition of heavy metals for the first 85 days start up period the reactor scheme is shown in fig 1 sbrs worked in 4 cycles per day each consisting of 70 min of inflow 235 min of reaction time 10 min of sedimentation 35 min of draining and 10 min of the idle phase detailed parameters for all the three reactors are presented in table 1 two reactors were used to study the effect of various heavy metal ion mixtures on the anammox process in sbr1 a mixture of nickel ni2 copper cu2 and zinc zn2 was tested while in sbr3 a mixture of chromium cr3 cadmium cd2 and lead pb2 was checked whereas the sbr2 reactor was a control reactor the following salts were used as the source of heavy metal ions crcl3 6h2o pbcl2 cu no3 2 3h2o nicl2 6h2o and zncl2 the experiment was divided into five periods during which the metal concentrations were successively increased the metal concentrations in each period are shown in table 2 the initial concentrations of the heavy metals were selected according to a previous analysis of heavy metals concentration in industrial wastewater in poland in wastewater coming into municipal wastewater treatment plants 2 2 analytical methods regular measurements of ammonium nitrite nitrate nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand cod were conducted by means of fast photometric tests merck millipore methods no 1 14752 1 14776 1 09713 1 14541 for nh4 n no2 n no3 n and cod respectively with a photometer merck spectroquant nova60 furthermore measurements of total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were performed once a week for physical parameters ph and temperature a wtw 340i ph multimeter was used tss and vss measurements were performed in accordance with the apha standard method apha 2012 2 3 bacteriological material sampling dna extraction and pcr analysis activated sludge samples from the sbr reactors were collected to 50 ml sterile falcon tubes and kept at 20 c until the dna isolation genetic material was isolated from the samples by means of a mechanical method 36 and stored at 20 c until further procedure two 16s rrna coding gene pcr products for the total community and for the anammox bacteria were obtained based on the total bacterial dna isolated from the samples the first amplicon for the total bacteria community monitoring was obtained with 338f gc and 518r primers ca 180 bp 37 and the second amplicon for the anammox 16s rrna coding gene was obtained with 368f gc and 820r ca 350 bp 38 they underwent the denturing gradient electrophoretic separation dgge in the dcode universal mutation detection system biorad the polyacrylamide gel 8 37 5 1 acrylamide bisacrylamide fluka was prepared with a gradient of the 30 60 denaturant urea and formamide according to the manufacturer s instruction the gel was run for 3 h at 120 v in a 1 tae buffer tris acetic acid edta ph 8 0 at a constant temperature of 60 c the gel was stained with sybr gold 1 10 000 invitrogen in miliq water for 15 min and distained in miliq water for 15 min then visualised under the uv light and photographed using the quantity one 1d software biorad the analysis of dgge fingerprints was performed using the quantity one 1d software biorad and shannon and simpson biodiversity indices were calculated for the samples 39 dna bands well separated from the rest of the fingerprint were cut off the gel and underwent sequencing using the abi prism 377 sequencer in order to identify the dominant genotypes the obtained sequences were compared with the genbank ncbi sequences by means of blast 3 results and discussion three sbr reactors were used to assess the long term effect of selected heavy metals on the anammox process in the period of work and work stabilisation before the proper tests the average efficiency of nitrogen removal in the system was 80 06 5 99 81 04 4 28 and 81 06 3 68 whereas the average rate of nitrogen removal was 0 157 0 03 0 161 0 02 and 0 160 0 02 g n l 1 d 1 for the sbr reactors 1 2 and 3 respectively 3 1 sbr performance under the long term stress of zinc nickel and copper after the start up period on day 86 of the test two different mixtures of three heavy metal salts were added to the inflow of the sbr 1 and sbr 3 reactors table 2 after adding zn cu and ni to the sbr 1 a slight increase in the nitrite concentration up to 1 5 mg l 1 was observed the average nitrogen removal efficiency dropped to 70 6 which was mainly associated with an increase in the activity of nitrite oxidising bacteria nob during this period the nitrates formed to nitrogen removed ratio increased to 0 25 0 02 from 0 12 0 04 in the start up period however the introduction of metals is not a reason for this because the same effect was observed in the control reactor and the increase in the nob activity was even greater the nitrates formed to nitrogen removed ratio increased to 0 29 0 05 from 0 15 0 03 in the start up period 34 days after adding heavy metals to the inflow and with no other adverse effects the concentration of heavy metal ions increased to 0 8 0 075 0 04 mg l 1 for zn cu and ni respectively in the third period within 30 days of period iii the rate and efficiency of nitrogen removal in the sbr1 reactor dropped sharply from 0 134 g n l 1 d 1 and 70 4 to 0 07 gnl 1 d 1 and 42 1 on day 151 of the study fig 3 at the same time the nitrite concentration increased to 7 mg l 1 and subsequently to 11 mg l 1 fig 2 b besides a significant increase in the ratio of nitrates to removed nitrogen was noted which increased to 0 38 0 21 on average with a maximum value of 0 71 on day 151 at the same time the parameters in the control reactor remained at a similar level as in the second period many authors report that microorganisms from biofilm or activated sludge produce extracellular polymeric substances eps which are a natural barrier that prevents heavy metals from entering cells 3 11 40 42 it seems that this protective ability of epss was sufficient in the second stage of the study however increasing the concentration of metals in the inflow caused a reduction in their ability to protect the cell therefore on day 152 the supply to the sbr1 reactor was turned off for 24 h which was to ensure a decrease in the nitrite concentration in the reactor subsequently based on the research of 2 28 29 and the results of batch tests it was decided to remove zinc in addition the research conducted by song et al 43 shows that zinc oxide is more toxic than other metal oxides such as cuo due to the release of zinc ions from the dissolution of zno which is the main mechanism that inhibits the anammox process considering that zinc was present in the highest concentrations it seemed most likely that it is responsible for inhibiting the process in period iv a slow but stable decrease in the nitrite nitrogen content was observed with a parallel increase in the efficiency of nitrogen removal to almost 66 the ratio of formed nitrates to removed nitrogen also improved and at the end of this period was 0 23 as the reactor operation was stable it was decided to increase the concentration of copper and nickel to 0 225 and 0 12 mg l 1 respectively period v in this period zinc was still not added to the medium since the increase in metal concentrations did not have a negative impact on the reactor s operation which was stable it was decided to add zinc at the concentration of 0 8 mg l 1 to the inflow again on the 210th day of the study this caused a very rapid breakdown of the process the nitrite concentration increased to 56 mg l 1 and the nitrogen removal efficiency dropped to 25 therefore it was again decided to remove zinc from the medium despite this the efficiency of the process could not be restored by the end of the study and on the day 250 the efficiency of nitrogen removal was only 37 such a rapid reaction of the process to the addition of zinc indicates on one hand that zinc is harmful to the anammox process and on the other hand that that it also has a cumulative effect on other metals as the effect of its addition was much more stronger than in period iii 3 2 sbr performance under the long term stress of cadmium chromium and lead a mixture of cadmium lead and chromium ions began to be added to the sbr3 reactor inflow medium from day 86 period ii the initial concentrations of these metals are shown in table 2 they were selected based on the average concentrations for various types of industrial wastewater in the case of chromium it usually occurs as trivalent cr iii and hexavalent cr vi forms in wastewater yu et al 44 reported cr iii did not impose inhibition as its toxicity is much lower than cr vi in the case of long term effects of chromium on anammox bacteria the results showed that the effect of anammox did not change at a low concentration of cr vi i e 0 0 5 mg l 1 but was severely inhibited at 0 8 mg l 1 the inhibition of process activity was mainly due to the significant intracellular reduction of cr vi yu et al 45 in addition jiang et al 2018 31 in their studies showed that during long term operation in the anaerobic flow sludge reactor significant anamox efficiency inhibitory effects were observed for concentrations of cr vi up to 2 mg l 1 hey additionally demonstrated that the tolerance of the anammox process to cr vi can be enhanced after a long term adaptive phase on the other hand chromium ill compounds are stable and occur naturally in the environment although cr iii is less toxic than cr vi long term exposure to a high concentration of cr iii may be toxic hexavalent chromium compounds are found in wastewater in much lower concentrations than trivalent chromium 46 47 the analysis of real wastewater showed that the content of cr iii is 5 10 times higher than cr vi taking into account the toxicity of particular forms the detoxification process consists mainly of the transformation or biotransformation of cr vi to cr iii compounds 48 in the case of the two stage anammox process the first stage is partial nitrification the studies presented by yu et al 45 shows that cr vi is reduced in nitrification systems taking into account very low concentrations of cr vi in the wastewater and additionally the partial nitrification process as a pre application of anammox it was decided to dose only cr iii compounds at the beginning of this research period like in the sbr1 and sbr2 reactors there was a slight decrease in the efficiency of nitrogen removal as compared to the average of 71 5 2 21 which was mainly caused by an increase in the activity of nob bacteria the average ratio of nitrates formed to removed nitrogen increased from 0 12 0 06 in the start up period to 0 25 0 03 in the second period however these values were close to the reference reactor and are not associated with any negative impact of the metals tested therefore on day 120 period iii the concentration of heavy metals in the reactor s feed was doubled as compared to those in the second period on day 137 the nitrite concentration in the reactor suddenly increased to 14 8 mg l 1 fig 2 c however it was associated with the mixer failure to prevent any further negative change the inflow was stopped for 12 h and after replacing the stirrer and restoring the inflow the nitrite concentration dropped below 1 mg l 1 in this period no negative influence of metals on the course of the process was noted the results obtained in the test reactor and the reference reactor were at a similar level fig 3 therefore in period iv the concentration of the tested metals was increased again table 2 on day 180 a slight increase in the nitrite concentration to 5 mg l 1 was observed but no further increase in the nitrite concentration or other negative effects were observed during this period the average nitrogen removal efficiency was 66 19 1 69 and it was comparable to the average nitrogen removal in the reference reactor 66 81 1 11 the low reactor efficiency was mainly due to the activity of nob bacteria as evidenced by the relatively high ratio of nitrate formation to nitrogen removal averaging 0 25 0 03 for the test reactor and 0 27 0 02 for the reference reactor the only visible effect of metals on bacteria was a change in the colour of the sludge in the reference sludge the colour was characteristic for anammox bacteria while in the sludge from sbr 3 the colour was darker black and brown which is probably related to the presence of heavy metals in the cells or their absorption into eps the concentration of all the heavy metals tested was increased again on day 199 period v table 2 however after the subsequent 40 days no negative changes were found and the reactor operating parameters were comparable to those obtained in the earlier periods of the experiment and in the reference reactor at this stage of the study the concentrations of heavy metals in the inlet to the reactor were much higher than those found in municipal wastewater and many types of industrial wastewater 3 3 impact of heavy metals on the microbial diversity in sequencing batch reactors at long term exposure heavy metals are considered to be harmful for microorganisms causing changes in the bacterial communities of activated sludge anammox bacteria are known to be one of the most sensitive groups of microorganisms to check such an impact in the pcr dgge analysis of 16s rrna coding gene amplicons activated sludge samples for pcr amplification were collected on day 85 period i 133 and 147 period iii and 184 period iv the obtained results show that heavy metals do not have any harmful influence on the total bacterial community and the anammox community fig 4 and fig 5 respectively the biodiversity of anammox bacteria is far lower than of the total bacterial community fig 6 and it is shown that the anammox process is performed only by one bacterial genotype fig 5 the genotypes identification based on dna sequencing was inconclusive none of the bands cut off the gel were identified precisely the sequences were the most common to uncultured bacterial clones from activated sludge these results clearly show that the dgge based separated dna bands identification is insufficient for bacterial communities such as activated sludge and that new tools such as next generation sequencing would be more helpful in the community analysis despite dynamic changes in operational conditions both the genotypic structure of the community expressed as fingerprints and the biodiversity indicators are relatively stable which may indicate that the bacteria present in it can resist the influence of heavy metals more effectively 49 4 conclusion continuous tests showed that the mixture of zn2 cu2 and ni2 at concentrations of 0 4 0 0375 and 0 02 mg l 1 corresponding to the doses of 0 59 0 06 and 0 03 mg gvss 1 respectively did not decrease the effectiveness of the anammox process however already twice as high concentrations caused a rapid inhibition of the process it was shown that zinc is the most responsible for the toxic effect its removal from the inflow caused an improvement of the reactor operation it follows that zinc itself is toxic to the anammox bacteria but this effect is further enhanced if it occurs in a mixture with other metals the mixture of cd2 cr3 and pb2 even at the highest concentrations tested did not adversely affect the course of the anammox process 0 008 0 5 and 0 2 mg l 1 respectively corresponding to the dose of 0 02 1 39 0 56 mg gvss 1 respectively did not cause any toxic effect on the anammox process further studies should focus on the examination of join effects of different metal mixtures declaration of competing interest the

13692,in this study copper benzene tricarboxylic cu btc or better known as hkust 1 was successfully synthesized using the solvothermal method in a solvent mixture of water ethanol and n n dimethylformamide dmf the mother liquor from the first synthesis was reused as a solvent for the subsequent hkust 1 synthesis for up to four repetitions cutting back the use of fresh solvent as much as 37 the fifth material obtained showed similar thermal stability and specific surface area to that of the first one even though the surface morphology turned from an octahedral shape in the first material to an irregular shape in the fifth material the results of the adsorption study on cr vi in aqueous media showed that the first and the fifth materials had adsorption capacities of 91 mg g and 100 mg g respectively both adsorbents followed a pseudo second order adsorption kinetics with a langmuir isothermal adsorption model keywords hkust 1 adsorption cr vi reuse mother liquor green chemistry 1 introduction green chemistry is an area of research that is focused on methods and the use of chemical substances that are environmental friendly material synthesis that uses organic precursors is typically done in organic solvents which tend to be toxic causing an increase in toxicity of the post synthesis waste therefore measures need to be taken for waste management of the post synthesis waste demir et al 2014 reported the reuse of mother liquor from the synthesis of a certain type of metal organic framework mof namely zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 zif 8 1 apart from containing the remainder solvent mother liquor also contains excess reactants that can be reused in the next synthesis 1 the resulting zif 8 from the synthesis with used solvents possesses the same structure as the resulting zif 8 from the first synthesis mof is a porous crystalline material consisting of organic ligands bound to metal ions as central atoms or metal clusters and has several distinctive characteristics such as varied structures large surface area large adsorption ability and regular pore size 2 this makes mof very intriguing to use in several applications including adsorption storage and separation of gases sensors and catalysts 3 possessing a large specific surface area and perfect porous structure causes mof to have a higher adsorption capacity compared to other porous materials 4 hkust 1 hong kong university of science and technology 1 is a type of mof first reported by chui et al in 1999 and is intensively studied until present day the advantages of hkust 1 among others are its relatively easy synthesis large surface area crystallinity porosity and high thermal stability 5 the main precursor of hkust 1 is copper ii nitrate trihydrate cu no3 2 3h2o and benzene 1 3 5 tricarboxylic acid h3btc the synthesis of hkust 1 that is achieved through a hydrothermal method without dmf solvent causes a decrease in pore volume of the material this is caused by btc ligand s low solubility in water 6 meanwhile the first synthesis of hkust 1 done by chui et al 1999 involved the use of pure dmf solvents and resulted in hkust 1 that possessed a bet surface area of up to 692 2 m2 g 7 modifications to the synthesis of hkust 1 materials are continuously done in an effort to increase it s surface area as well as it s crystallinity chowdhury et al 2009 reported that hkust 1 synthesized in a solvent mixture of ethanol and dmf possessed a surface area of 1428 m2 g higher than that of hkust 1 synthesized in a solvent mixture of ethanol and water namely 857 m2 g 8 furthermore the use of pure dmf followed by a chemical activation process is able to produce hkust 1 with a surface area of up to 1948 m2 g 9 in the synthesis of hkust 1 dmf solvents are needed to due to its important role in the deprotonation process of h3btc ligand in our previous report hkust 1 was synthesized using a solvothermal method in a solvent mixture of water ethanol and n n dimethylformamide dmf with a volume ratio of 1 1 1 at a temperature of 100 c for 10 h the obtained reaction mixture consisted of bright blue crystals and clear blue mother liquor 10 the blue color from the filtrate is a qualitative indicator that the obtained reaction mixture still contains excess reactants the result of analysis using atomic absorption spectrometry aas showed that the concentration of cu in the filtrate was 0 381 mol l besides containing the heavy metal cu ion the filtrate also contained dmf a type of organic solvent with several disadvantages such as toxicity and being relatively expensive in price disposal of mother liquor directly into water streams would certainly cause environmental problems therefore in this study mother liquor was reused as a solvent in the subsequent synthesis of hkust 1 up to four repetitions its performance as an adsorbent was examined for the removal of chromium in aqueous solutions chromium is a heavy metal that has carcinogenic potential 11 industrial waste containing heavy metals must be handled appropriately so that the level is in accordance to the standard quality of wastewater that is allowed to be discharged into the environment one method to reduce chromium in water is adsorption because the costs required are relatively inexpensive and the adsorbent can be regenerated 12 some adsorbents that have been reported for adsorption of chromium include uio 66 nh2 13 zif 8 14 and gg nzno biocomposite 15 some researchers have reported that hkust 1 can have a micro sized pore by producing a type 1 graph in the measurement of the n2 adsorption isotherm which are characteristics of a microporous material this microporosity property causes the limited application of hkust 1 material mainly as an adsorbent because it can inhibit the rate of diffusion during adsorption 16 the pore size of a porous material can be enlarged by adding surfactants to the reaction system during the synthesis 3 guan et al 2018 have reported that aluminosilica mesoporous materials were successfully synthesized by adding cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctabr as a surfactant into the reaction system 17 the obtained materials showed a type iv of nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms characteristics to that of mesoporous materials 17 synthesis of zif 8 with the addition of ctabr as a surfactant was reported by pan et al 2011 and revealed that the addition of ctabr as much as 0 0025 0 01 and 0 025 resulted in a decrease in crystal size in a sequence of 2 8 0 5 and 0 11 μm respectively 18 in this study the first and the fifth synthesized hkust 1 were used as adsorbents for the removal of cr vi in aqueous solutions the influence of contact time ph of the solution and initial chromium concentrations were observed to determine the optimal adsorption conditions studies on adsorption kinetics and isothermal adsorption were also discussed in this study 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis of hkust 1 the method used for the synthesis of hkust 1 in this study was the solvothermal method as reported by chui et al 7 and modified by ediati et al 10 typically 1 g of h3btc was dissolved in 30 ml of solvent mixture with a 1 1 ratio of ethanol dmf then in a separate container as much as 2 077 g of cu no3 2 3h2o was dissolved in 15 ml of distilled water the addition of ctabr was carried out after the h3btc ligand completely dissolved the two solutions were mixed in a vial bottle and stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 15 min the reaction mixture was placed in an oven at a temperature of 100 c for 10 h and then left at room temperature for two days followed by filtration the volume of mother liquor was measured denoted as f1 and reused for the subsequent synthesis of hkust 1 the precipitate formed was washed with 20 ml of dmf then washed in 20 ml of chloroform then immersed three times in 30 ml of warm methanol at temperatures between 40 55 c 24 h each time the light blue precipitate was then separated dried in an oven at a temperature of 70 c and denoted as hkust 1 s1 for comparison hkust 1 was also synthesized without the addition of ctabr and denoted as hkust 1 s0 furthermore f1 was used as a solvent for subsequent synthesis processes for up to 4 repetitions it is important to note that the volume of the solvent was kept at 45 ml by addition of fresh solvent with an equal ratio of water ethanol and dmf the solids obtained were denoted as hkust 1 sn where n expressed the repetition number 2 2 characterization of synthesized materials the obtained materials were characterized

using the hkust 1 s1 and hkust 1 s5 adsorbents the initial concentration of the cr vi solution of 25 mg l and the adsorbent quantity of 0 5 g l were chosen the adsorption experiments were carried out at room temperature with a stirring speed of 100 rpm after which the adsorbent was separated by centrifugation at a speed of 3500 rpm for 10 min the stirring times were varied between 8 56 minutes with an increment of 8 min the remaining chromium content in the supernatant was determined using aas the adsorption capacity and removal were then calculated using the following eqs 1 and 2 1 q e c o

concentrations the effect of ph and initial cr vi concentrations on the adsorption capacities of hkust 1 s1 and hkust 1 s5 were determined by conducting a series of adsorption experiments similar to the effect of contact time the ph of the solution was varied at 2 5 7 and 10 respectively with a stirring time of 48 min further experiments were conducted by varying the initial concentration of the chromium solution between 25 200 mg l with an increment of 25 mg l 3 result and discussion 3 1 reuse of mother liquor the solvent efficiency aspect of the synthesis of hkust 1 can be calculated from the volume of fresh solvent added to each synthesis process in this study the f1 volume obtained was 21 ml therefore on every subsequent synthesis process as much as 24 ml of fresh solvent was added to keep the total volume of the solvent at 45 ml for a synthesis process of up to 5 times in which mother liquor was reused in 4 of those processes it was calculated that the fresh solvent used for the first synthesis was 45 ml and an additional 96 ml was used for the other 4 times adding to a total of 141 ml synthesis without the use of used solvent needed a total of 225 ml of fresh solvent for a synthesis process of up to 5 times this shows that the use of used solvent can save fresh solvent as much as 84 ml or 37 the decrease in the volume of mother liquor is most likely due to the evaporation of water and ethanol furthermore parts of the dmf serving as a deprotonation agent may have been trapped in crystal pores that were formed which in turn disappeared in the activation process 19 3 2 characterization of adsorbent materials xrd patterns for all synthesized materials exhibited an intense peak at a 2θ of 11 5 and exhibited other peaks with lower intensities at 6 6 9 4 and 13 4 which is shown in fig 1 the 2θ values of xrd patterns for all synthesized materials and their intensities are shown in table 1 the xrd patterns correspond well with that of hkust 1 reported by xu et al 2019 20 confirming the successful synthesis of hkust 1 these results indicate that the mother liquor can be reused as a solvent in the subsequent hkust 1 synthesis up to at least four repetitions however the intensity of the peaks decreased following each increment of the repetition due to the decrease of the amount of dmf which were trapped inside the pores the existence of dmf molecules helps the polymerization process and large framework formations 5 21 ftir spectra of all synthesized materials are shown in fig 2 there are 5 specific absorption bands derived from the hkust 1 spectra the finger print area at wave number 731 cm 1 shows the presence of stretching cu o vibrations 22 other typical absorption bands also appear at wavenumbers 1375 1450 and 1641 cm 1 indicating the existence of stretching vibrations of co groups vibrations cc aromatic and stretching vibrations of groups co in addition a weak absorption band appears at a wavenumber of about 3423 cm 1 which indicates the presence of vibrations from the oh group the ftir spectra of the obtained solids show characteristic absorption bands at wavenumbers similar to that reported for hkust 1 20 the surface morphology of the hkust 1 s1 shown in fig 3 a has a crystal shape resembling an octahedral form with sharp angles and is clearly similar to that of hkust 1 reported by our previous study 23 the hkust 1 s5 however resembles an irregular crystal shape with a smaller crystal size fig 3 b the use of mother liquor containing excess reactants as a solvent in the synthesis of hkust 1 leads to an increase in concentration of each reactant in the reaction mixture which stimulates irregular crystals formation the thermal stability of the synthesized hkust 1 s0 hkust 1 s1 and hkust 1 s5 were evaluated using thermal gravimetric analysis tga and shown in fig 4 the first weight loss occurred in the temperature range between 25 120 c this was due to the loss of volatile solvents in this case ethanol and water molecules from the framework of hkust 1 23 subsequently a gradual weight loss occurred until a temperature of 260 c corresponding to the removal of the remaining dmf from the pores boiling point of 153 c the sharp weight loss occurred from around a temperature of 300 c indicating the occurrence of a thermal decomposition of the hkust 1 frameworks leading to the formation of cuo 24 based on the tga curves it was revealed that the reuse of mother liquor up to four times did not significantly affect the thermal stabilities of the obtained hkust 1 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm method used in this characterization was the bet method brunauer emmet and teller the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm from the synthesized hkust 1 materials showed a type i of the to the iupac classification fig 5 the type i curve shows the characteristic of a microporous material where there was a rapid increase in volume at a relatively low pressure 4 the presence of a narrow hysteresis loops in the p p0 area of 0 4 0 8 in all materials indicated that the materials also possessed meso sized pores 25 the pore size distribution was explained using the bjh method barrett joiner and halenda which is shown in fig 6 hkust 1 s1 and hkust 1 s5 had the same pore size of around about 21 8 ǻ 2 18 nm whilst hkust 1 s0 had a smaller pore size of 21 2ǻ 2 12 nm the bjh results indicated that hkust 1 s1 and hkust 1 s5 were dominated by micropores with a small portion of mesopores due to the addition of the surfactant ctabr during the synthesis which acted as a template in the formation of mesoporous mof 13 table 2 also presents results from previous studies for comparison 3 3 adsorption performance 3 3 1 effect of solution ph the adsorption of chromium by hkust 1 is sensitive to changes in the ph of the solution because it affects the solubility of k2cr2o7 and the surface conditions of the adsorbent the experimental results on the influence of ph on chromium adsorption are shown in fig 7 as can be seen the amount of chromium adsorbed by hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 increased subsequently to the increase in the ph of the solution namely from 2 until 7 reaching a maximum chromium removal of 38 05 and 33 48 for hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 respectively in the condition of a neutral ph solution subsequently the chromium removal decreased to 13 37 and 19 88 for hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 respectively when the ph of the solutions were 10 this tendency is understandable given the presence of chromium in various oxidation states and a constant change in the ph of the solution at a ph of between 1 6 chromium is likely found in the form of hydrogen chromate hcro4 whilst at a ph 7 it is preferably in the form of chromate cro2 4 in the neutral ph range cro4 2 hcro4 and cr2o7 2 are the expected forms of cr vi which dissolve easily azhar et al 2017 reported that the point of zero change phpzc from hkust 1 is 6 indicating that at a ph phpzc the adsorbent surface tends to be positively charged 27 the increase of the adsorption capacity below the neutral ph happens as a result of a strong electrostatic interaction between the positively charged hkust 1 adsorbent surface and the negatively charged adsorbate ion on the other hand the free energy of the adsorption of hcro4 namely between 2 5 to 0 6 kcal mol is lower to that of cro4 2 namely between 2 1 to 0 3 kcal mol as a result at similar conditions hcro4 is easier to adsorb than cro4 2 28 whereas at a ph 7 the adsorbent surface tends to be negatively charged this prevents an electrostatic interaction between the adsorbate and the adsorbent due to negation which in turn results in a decrease in the adsorption capacity value besides that there exists a competition between the oh ion originating from naoh at the time of the adjustment of ph with the cro4 2 ion 28 29 a similar thing happened in the research reported by maleki et al in which it was reported that the optimum ph of the chromium adsorption using hkust 1 was 7 26 3 3 2 effect of contact time the time taken to reach equilibrium is an important parameter in predicting the efficiency and feasibility of the adsorbents in controlling water pollution 30 the chromium adsorption process was done at a ph of 7 with an initial adsorbate concentration of 25 mg l the effect of contact time on chromium adsorption capacity for hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 adsorbents are shown in fig 8 the time profiles of the adsorption capacity for the two adsorbents were almost the same the adsorption capacity increased significantly when the contact time was less than 32 min indicating a fast interaction between chromium ions with active sites located on the surface of the adsorbents then the adsorption started to slow down before reaching complete adsorption equilibrium after 48 min in the range of between 32 and 48 min the surface of the adsorbents probably reached saturation thus the chromium ions penetrated into the pores and were adsorbed inside the pores at the equilibrium state all the surfaces of the adsorbents were fully covered by chromium ions and became saturated 31 3 3 3 effect of initial concentration the initial concentration of the adsorbate in a solution plays an important role during the uptake of pollutants from an aqueous solution by adsorption fig 9 shows the effect of initial cr vi concentrations in the range of 25 200 mg l with an increment of 25 mg l on the adsorption capacity of hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 adsorbents as can be seen at the initial cr vi concentration of 175 mg l the adsorption capacity of both adsorbents increased following the rise of the initial cr vi concentrations reaching a maximum value of 59 28 mg g and 67 85 mg g for hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 respectively the higher adsorption capacity of the hkust 1 s5 compared to that of hkust 1 s0 was related to the larger bet surface area of hkust 1 s5 3 4 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics studies provide information regarding the adsorption mechanism of adsorbents during the mass transport process the adsorption kinetics in this study was reviewed in terms of pseudo first order and pseudo second order in accordance to wang et al 2020 32 the pseudo first order kinetics equation describes the adsorption process on a solid liquid system which is based on the capacity of the solid eq 3 is the general equation of pseudo first order reaction kinetics 3 l n q e q t l n q e k 1 t where qe is the adsorption capacity at the equilibrium mg g qt is the adsorption capacity at a certain time of t mg g and k1 is the adsorption rate constant for pseudo first order 1 min from the graph plot of t minutes as the x axis versus ln qe qt as the y axis the k1 value is obtained from the slope of the linear equation whereas the calculated qe qecal is obtained from the exponential of the intercept the pseudo second order kinetics equation represents how the adsorbate depends on the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent rather than the adsorbate concentration the rate of the pseudo second order reaction depends on the amount of the substance adsorbed at the equilibrium the kinetics equation of the pseudo second order adsorption rate is written as eq 4 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the pseudo second order adsorption rate constant g mg min from the plot of t minutes as the x axis versus t qt as the y axis the value of the calculated qe qecal is obtained from 1 slope of the linear equation and k2 is obtained from slope2 intercept the suitability of the adsorption kinetics model is obtained from the value of the correlation coefficient r2 of the diagram closest to 1 the calculated parameters of the adsorption kinetics study are shown in table 3 the plots of pseudo first and pseudo second order reactions are available in fig s1 and fig s2 it can be seen that the correlation coefficient r2 of the pseudo second order plots for both adsorbents has a higher value compared to the pseudo first order plots this indicates that adsorption of cr vi follows the pseudo second order adsorption kinetics models 33 it should be noted that the pseudo second order adsorption kinetics model is derived from the assumption that the limit of the adsorption rate depends on the chemical adsorption process based on the data in table 3 it can be seen that the values of the adsorption capacity calculated in pseudo second order adsorption kinetics are similar to the values of the experimental adsorption capacity values these results reinforce the suitability of pseudo second order adsorption model in the process of adsorption of chromium ions using hkust 1 adsorbents 34 in addition to r2 another parameter that is also calculated from the diagram is the pseudo second order adsorption kinetic constant k2 as shown in table 3 the k2 of hkust 1 s5 0 003 g mg 1 min 1 is greater than that of hkust 1 0 0016 g mg 1 min 1 which indicates that hkust 1 s5 adsorbents has a faster cr vi adsorption rate 3 5 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherms of cr vi on both hkust 1 and hkust 1 s5 adsorbents were obtained after adsorption for 48 min in solutions with various cr vi concentrations the chromium concentration is related to the number of active sites on the surface of the adsorbent that can bind anion the correlation between the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents and the concentration of cr vi at equilibrium are shown in figs s3 s6 where the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherms are applied to fit the equilibrium data the langmuir adsorption isotherm equation can be theoretically derived by assuming a balance between the molecules of the substance adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent and the molecules of the non adsorbed substance the langmuir equation assumes that adsorption takes place on specific surfaces of homogeneous adsorbents in addition only a single layer is formed in the langmuir isotherm at maximum adsorption each atom is only adsorbed at a certain point on the surface of the adsorbent and each part of the surface can only hold one molecule or atom the langmuir adsorption isotherm equation is written as eq 5 5 1 q e 1 q m 1 q m k l c e where qe mg g is the amount of adsorbate per unit mass of adsorbent and ce mg l is the concentration of adsorbate at equilibrium both qm mg g and kl l mg are the langmuir constants from the plot of 1 ce as the x axis and 1 qe as the y axis the value of qm maximum adsorption capacity is obtained from 1 intercept and the kl value the langmuir constant is obtained from intercept slope the freundlich isotherm equation is based on the assumption that adsorbents have heterogeneous surfaces and that each molecule has different absorption capabilities the freundlich isothermal adsorption equation is written as eq 6 6 l n q e l n k f 1 n l n c e where the kf value is the freundlich isotherm constant l mg qe is the amount of molecules adsorbed in each gram of adsorbent or adsorbent capacity ce is the adsorbate concentration after adsorption and 1 n is the adsorption intensity the value of 1 n ranges between 0 1 reflecting the heterogeneity of the surface by plotting lnce as the x axis versus lnqe as the y axis the value of kf the freundlich constant is obtained from the exponential of intercept temkin isotherm takes into account factors that are explicitly related to the interaction between adsorbents and adsorbates by ignoring the very low or high concentration values this model assumes that the energy or heat of adsorption of all molecules in the layer decreases linearly with increasing coverage due to the adsorbent adsorbate interactions from the rejection of adsorbate adsorbate the adsorbed adsorbates are evenly distributed between layers 35 as implied in the equation the derivation of this model can be characterized by an even distribution of the binding energy up to a certain maximum binding energy which is determined by plotting the amount absorbed qe against lnce eq 7 is the linear equation of the temkin isothermal adsorption 7 q e r t b l n k t r t b ln c e where t is the absolute temperature r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k b is the constant related to the heat of adsorption whose value can be determined from the slope and intercept kt is an equilibrium binding constant l mg which depends on the maximum binding energy of the adsorbate and the adsorbent the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm is generally used to describe the adsorption mechanism with gaussian energy distribution on heterogeneous surfaces the assumption of this model is that the adsorption has a multi layered character involves van der waals forces and applies physical adsorption processes isothermal d r can be used to estimate the average free adsorption energy e if the e value is less than 8 kj mol then physical adsorption applies however if e is between 8 kj mol and 16 kj mol then the chemical ion exchange mechanism applies if the value is higher than 16 kj mol then the adsorption mechanism is dominated by the diffusion of chemical particles 35 the d r isothermal adsorption model is represented linearly as follows 8 8 l n q e l n q s k a d x ε 2 where qe is the amount of adsorbate on adsorbent at equilibrium mg g qs is the theoretical isothermal saturation capacity mg g and kad is the dubinin radushkevich isothermal adsorption constant mol2 kj2 ε is the dubinin radushkevich isothermal constant which can be determined using eq 9 9 ε r t ln 1 1 c e where t is the absolute temperature the value of qs and kad can be calculated from the intercept and slope of the plots of lnqe versus ε2 whilst e can be calculated using the following eq 10 10 e 1 2 k a d the isotherm parameters obtained from the adsorption of cr vi onto hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 are presented in table s1 as shown in table s1 the calculated e values according to the d r isotherm modelling are 28 867 and 31 622 kj mol for hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 respectively indicating that the adsorption mechanism is dominated by chemical particle diffusion table 4 summarizes the correlation coefficient the r2 values and the adsorption kinetics constants kl and kf obtained from the two isotherm models for the adsorption of cr vi onto hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 results from the previous studies are included for comparison based on the r2 values the langmuir isotherm model gave higher r2 values of 0 984 and 0 991 for hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 respectively compared to the r2 values of 0 930 and 0 947 for hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 respectively obtained from the freundlich isotherm model the results revealed that the adsorption system of cr vi by the two adsorbents was found to better fit the langmuir isotherm model which indicated that adsorption occurred in a monolayer and at the same surface energy level with chemical interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate 36 the langmuir isotherm model observed for the adsorption system of cr vi with hkust 1 was also reported by maleki et al 2015 26 the use of other adsorbents for adsorption of cr vi such as uio66 nh2 13 and zif 8 14 were also fit to the langmuir and freundlich isothermal model table 4 in the case of the maximum adsorption capacity qmax value obtained from the langmuir isotherm model the adsorbent hkust 1 s5 showed a higher qmax value 100 mg g than that of hkust 1 s0 90 9 mg g this result should be correlated with the formation of larger pores on hkust 1 s5 which is due to the addition of ctabr during the synthesis process this allowed the adsorbate molecules to diffuse easier into the adsorbent pores when comparing the results of various studies on cr vi adsorption in aqueous solution shown in table 5 the use of hkust 1 as an adsorbent in this study shows a higher adsorption capacity value than other mof adsorbents used in other studies such as uio 66 nh2 10 and zif 8 11 3 6 adsorption mechanism adsorption of cr vi in the solution onto the hkust 1 adsorbent is considered to follow several mechanisms namely 1 filling of the adsorbent pore surface 2 electrostatic interaction and 3 ion exchange in this study adsorbents with a larger pore structure were likely to adsorb more chromium ions with the assistance of the hypercamp 8 0 software the size of the molecules are calculated to be 3 18 0 21 7 05 å3 3 38 0 25 3 74 å3 and 3 48 0 24 4 16 å3 for cr2o7 2 cro4 2 and hcro4 respectively the hkust 1 s5 material has the biggest pore size 2 18 nm therefore the diffusion of adsorbent molecules interacts easier on the pore surface of the adsorbents which in turn causes a high value of adsorption capacity furthermore electrostatic interactions occurred on the terminal hydroxyl group in hkust 1 with chromium ions contributing to the increase in the adsorption capacity apart from that the condition of the adsorption ph that is done below phpzc causes the surface of the material to be positively charged which in turn can increase the electrostatic interaction with the adsorbents that are negatively charged cro4 2 hcro4 and cr2o7 2 28 29 in addition the presence of electrons π in the hkust 1 framework were able to reduce cr vi ions into cr iii ions and released in the solution the cr iii ions were either adsorbed by the acidic site of the hkust 1 adsorbent or experienced precipitation in the form of chromium hydroxide 29 40 4 conclusion in this study hkust 1 materials were successfully synthesized using the solvothermal method in a solvent mixture of water ethanol and dmf with an equal volume ratio the mother liquor from the first synthesis was successfully reused as the solvent for the subsequent hkust 1 synthesis processes up to four repetitions this study on the adsorption of hkust 1 on cr vi in aqueous solution showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 91 mg g for the first hkust 1 material and 100 mg g for the fifth hkust 1 material both hkust 1 materials followed the pseudo second order adsorption kinetics with a langmuir isothermal adsorption model from the fact that the reuse of mother liquor for up to four times results in the formation of hkust 1 with the highest adsorption capacity shows that the mother liquor can be reused as solvent for subsequent synthesis processes this reduces the amount of solvent used which is in accordance to a

13692,in this study copper benzene tricarboxylic cu btc or better known as hkust 1 was successfully synthesized using the solvothermal method in a solvent mixture of water ethanol and n n dimethylformamide dmf the mother liquor from the first synthesis was reused as a solvent for the subsequent hkust 1 synthesis for up to four repetitions cutting back the use of fresh solvent as much as 37 the fifth material obtained showed similar thermal stability and specific surface area to that of the first one even though the surface morphology turned from an octahedral shape in the first material to an irregular shape in the fifth material the results of the adsorption study on cr vi in aqueous media showed that the first and the fifth materials had adsorption capacities of 91 mg g and 100 mg g respectively both adsorbents followed a pseudo second order adsorption kinetics with a langmuir isothermal adsorption model keywords hkust 1 adsorption cr vi reuse mother liquor green chemistry 1 introduction green chemistry is an area of research that is focused on methods and the use of chemical substances that are environmental friendly material synthesis that uses organic precursors is typically done in organic solvents which tend to be toxic causing an increase in toxicity of the post synthesis waste therefore measures need to be taken for waste management of the post synthesis waste demir et al 2014 reported the reuse of mother liquor from the synthesis of a certain type of metal organic framework mof namely zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 zif 8 1 apart from containing the remainder solvent mother liquor also contains excess reactants that can be reused in the next synthesis 1 the resulting zif 8 from the synthesis with used solvents possesses the same structure as the resulting zif 8 from the first synthesis mof is a porous crystalline material consisting of organic ligands bound to metal ions as central atoms or metal clusters and has several distinctive characteristics such as varied structures large surface area large adsorption ability and regular pore size 2 this makes mof very intriguing to use in several applications including adsorption storage and separation of gases sensors and catalysts 3 possessing a large specific surface area and perfect porous structure causes mof to have a higher adsorption capacity compared to other porous materials 4 hkust 1 hong kong university of science and technology 1 is a type of mof first reported by chui et al in 1999 and is intensively studied until present day the advantages of hkust 1 among others are its relatively easy synthesis large surface area crystallinity porosity and high thermal stability 5 the main precursor of hkust 1 is copper ii nitrate trihydrate cu no3 2 3h2o and benzene 1 3 5 tricarboxylic acid h3btc the synthesis of hkust 1 that is achieved through a hydrothermal method without dmf solvent causes a decrease in pore volume of the material this is caused by btc ligand s low solubility in water 6 meanwhile the first synthesis of hkust 1 done by chui et al 1999 involved the use of pure dmf solvents and resulted in hkust 1 that possessed a bet surface area of up to 692 2 m2 g 7 modifications to the synthesis of hkust 1 materials are continuously done in an effort to increase it s surface area as well as it s crystallinity chowdhury et al 2009 reported that hkust 1 synthesized in a solvent mixture of ethanol and dmf possessed a surface area of 1428 m2 g higher than that of hkust 1 synthesized in a solvent mixture of ethanol and water namely 857 m2 g 8 furthermore the use of pure dmf followed by a chemical activation process is able to produce hkust 1 with a surface area of up to 1948 m2 g 9 in the synthesis of hkust 1 dmf solvents are needed to due to its important role in the deprotonation process of h3btc ligand in our previous report hkust 1 was synthesized using a solvothermal method in a solvent mixture of water ethanol and n n dimethylformamide dmf with a volume ratio of 1 1 1 at a temperature of 100 c for 10 h the obtained reaction mixture consisted of bright blue crystals and clear blue mother liquor 10 the blue color from the filtrate is a qualitative indicator that the obtained reaction mixture still contains excess reactants the result of analysis using atomic absorption spectrometry aas showed that the concentration of cu in the filtrate was 0 381 mol l besides containing the heavy metal cu ion the filtrate also contained dmf a type of organic solvent with several disadvantages such as toxicity and being relatively expensive in price disposal of mother liquor directly into water streams would certainly cause environmental problems therefore in this study mother liquor was reused as a solvent in the subsequent synthesis of hkust 1 up to four repetitions its performance as an adsorbent was examined for the removal of chromium in aqueous solutions chromium is a heavy metal that has carcinogenic potential 11 industrial waste containing heavy metals must be handled appropriately so that the level is in accordance to the standard quality of wastewater that is allowed to be discharged into the environment one method to reduce chromium in water is adsorption because the costs required are relatively inexpensive and the adsorbent can be regenerated 12 some adsorbents that have been reported for adsorption of chromium include uio 66 nh2 13 zif 8 14 and gg nzno biocomposite 15 some researchers have reported that hkust 1 can have a micro sized pore by producing a type 1 graph in the measurement of the n2 adsorption isotherm which are characteristics of a microporous material this microporosity property causes the limited application of hkust 1 material mainly as an adsorbent because it can inhibit the rate of diffusion during adsorption 16 the pore size of a porous material can be enlarged by adding surfactants to the reaction system during the synthesis 3 guan et al 2018 have reported that aluminosilica mesoporous materials were successfully synthesized by adding cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctabr as a surfactant into the reaction system 17 the obtained materials showed a type iv of nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms characteristics to that of mesoporous materials 17 synthesis of zif 8 with the addition of ctabr as a surfactant was reported by pan et al 2011 and revealed that the addition of ctabr as much as 0 0025 0 01 and 0 025 resulted in a decrease in crystal size in a sequence of 2 8 0 5 and 0 11 μm respectively 18 in this study the first and the fifth synthesized hkust 1 were used as adsorbents for the removal of cr vi in aqueous solutions the influence of contact time ph of the solution and initial chromium concentrations were observed to determine the optimal adsorption conditions studies on adsorption kinetics and isothermal adsorption were also discussed in this study 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis of hkust 1 the method used for the synthesis of hkust 1 in this study was the solvothermal method as reported by chui et al 7 and modified by ediati et al 10 typically 1 g of h3btc was dissolved in 30 ml of solvent mixture with a 1 1 ratio of ethanol dmf then in a separate container as much as 2 077 g of cu no3 2 3h2o was dissolved in 15 ml of distilled water the addition of ctabr was carried out after the h3btc ligand completely dissolved the two solutions were mixed in a vial bottle and stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 15 min the reaction mixture was placed in an oven at a temperature of 100 c for 10 h and then left at room temperature for two days followed by filtration the volume of mother liquor was measured denoted as f1 and reused for the subsequent synthesis of hkust 1 the precipitate formed was washed with 20 ml of dmf then washed in 20 ml of chloroform then immersed three times in 30 ml of warm methanol at temperatures between 40 55 c 24 h each time the light blue precipitate was then separated dried in an oven at a temperature of 70 c and denoted as hkust 1 s1 for comparison hkust 1 was also synthesized without the addition of ctabr and denoted as hkust 1 s0 furthermore f1 was used as a solvent for subsequent synthesis processes for up to 4 repetitions it is important to note that the volume of the solvent was kept at 45 ml by addition of fresh solvent with an equal ratio of water ethanol and dmf the solids obtained were denoted as hkust 1 sn where n expressed the repetition number 2 2 characterization of synthesized materials the obtained materials were characterized

using the hkust 1 s1 and hkust 1 s5 adsorbents the initial concentration of the cr vi solution of 25 mg l and the adsorbent quantity of 0 5 g l were chosen the adsorption experiments were carried out at room temperature with a stirring speed of 100 rpm after which the adsorbent was separated by centrifugation at a speed of 3500 rpm for 10 min the stirring times were varied between 8 56 minutes with an increment of 8 min the remaining chromium content in the supernatant was determined using aas the adsorption capacity and removal were then calculated using the following eqs 1 and 2 1 q e c o c e x v w 2 r e m o v a l c 0 c e c o x 100 where qe is the adsorption capacity mg g and co and ce are the chromium concentrations before and after adsorption mg l 2 3 2 effect of ph and initial cr vi concentrations the effect of ph and initial cr vi concentrations on the adsorption capacities of hkust 1 s1 and hkust 1 s5 were determined by conducting a series of adsorption experiments similar to the effect of contact time the ph of the solution was varied at 2 5 7 and 10 respectively with a stirring time of 48 min further experiments were conducted by varying the initial concentration of the chromium solution between 25 200 mg l with an increment of 25 mg l 3 result and discussion 3 1 reuse of mother liquor the solvent efficiency aspect of the synthesis of hkust 1 can be calculated from the volume of fresh solvent added to each synthesis process in this study the f1 volume obtained was 21 ml therefore on every subsequent synthesis process as much as 24 ml of fresh solvent was added to keep the total volume of the solvent at 45 ml for a synthesis process of up to 5 times in which mother liquor was reused in 4 of those processes it was calculated that the fresh solvent used for the first synthesis was 45 ml and an additional 96 ml was used for the other 4 times adding to a total of 141 ml synthesis without the use of used solvent needed a total of 225 ml of fresh solvent for a synthesis process of up to 5 times this shows that the use of used solvent can save fresh solvent as much as 84 ml or 37 the decrease in the volume of mother liquor is most likely due to the evaporation of water and ethanol furthermore parts of the dmf serving as a deprotonation agent may have been trapped in crystal pores that were formed which in turn disappeared in the activation process 19 3 2 characterization of adsorbent materials xrd patterns for all synthesized materials exhibited an intense peak at a 2θ of 11 5 and exhibited other peaks with lower intensities at 6 6 9 4 and 13 4 which is shown in fig 1 the 2θ values of xrd patterns for all synthesized materials and their intensities are shown in table 1 the xrd patterns correspond well with that of hkust 1 reported by xu et al 2019 20 confirming the successful synthesis of hkust 1 these results indicate that the mother liquor can be reused as a solvent in the subsequent hkust 1 synthesis up to at least four repetitions however the intensity of the peaks decreased following each increment of the repetition due to the decrease of the amount of dmf which were trapped inside the pores the existence of dmf molecules helps the polymerization process and large framework formations 5 21 ftir spectra of all synthesized materials are shown in fig 2 there are 5 specific absorption bands derived from the hkust 1 spectra the finger print area at wave number 731 cm 1 shows the presence of stretching cu o vibrations 22 other typical absorption bands also appear at wavenumbers 1375 1450 and 1641 cm 1 indicating the existence of stretching vibrations of co groups vibrations cc aromatic and stretching vibrations of groups co in addition a weak absorption band appears at a wavenumber of about 3423 cm 1 which indicates the presence of vibrations from the oh group the ftir spectra of the obtained solids show characteristic absorption bands at wavenumbers similar to that reported for hkust 1 20 the surface morphology of the hkust 1 s1 shown in fig 3 a has a crystal shape resembling an octahedral form with sharp angles and is clearly similar to that of hkust 1 reported by our previous study 23 the hkust 1 s5 however resembles an irregular crystal shape with a smaller crystal size fig 3 b the use of mother liquor containing excess reactants as a solvent in the synthesis of hkust 1 leads to an increase in concentration of each reactant in the reaction mixture which stimulates irregular crystals formation the thermal stability of the synthesized hkust 1 s0 hkust 1 s1 and hkust 1 s5 were evaluated using thermal gravimetric analysis tga and shown in fig 4 the first weight loss occurred in the temperature range between 25 120 c this was due to the loss of volatile solvents in this case ethanol and water molecules from the framework of hkust 1 23 subsequently a gradual weight loss occurred until a temperature of 260 c corresponding to the removal of the remaining dmf from the pores boiling point of 153 c the sharp weight loss occurred from around a temperature of 300 c indicating the occurrence of a thermal decomposition of the hkust 1 frameworks leading to the formation of cuo 24 based on the tga curves it was revealed that the reuse of mother liquor up to four times did not significantly affect the thermal stabilities of the obtained hkust 1 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm method used in this characterization was the bet method brunauer emmet and teller the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm from the synthesized hkust 1 materials showed a type i of the to the iupac classification fig 5 the type i curve shows the characteristic of a microporous material where there was a rapid increase in volume at a relatively low pressure 4 the presence of a narrow hysteresis loops in the p p0 area of 0 4 0 8 in all materials indicated that the materials also possessed meso sized pores 25 the pore size distribution was explained using the bjh method barrett joiner and halenda which is shown in fig 6 hkust 1 s1 and hkust 1 s5 had the same pore size of around about 21 8 ǻ 2 18 nm whilst hkust 1 s0 had a smaller pore size of 21 2ǻ 2 12 nm the bjh results indicated that hkust 1 s1 and hkust 1 s5 were dominated by micropores with a small portion of mesopores due to the addition of the surfactant ctabr during the synthesis which acted as a template in the formation of mesoporous mof 13 table 2 also presents results from previous studies for comparison 3 3 adsorption performance 3 3 1 effect of solution ph the adsorption of chromium by hkust 1 is sensitive to changes in the ph of the solution because it affects the solubility of k2cr2o7 and the surface conditions of the adsorbent the experimental results on the influence of ph on chromium adsorption are shown in fig 7 as can be seen the amount of chromium adsorbed by hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 increased subsequently to the increase in the ph of the solution namely from 2 until 7 reaching a maximum chromium removal of 38 05 and 33 48 for hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 respectively in the condition of a neutral ph solution subsequently the chromium removal decreased to 13 37 and 19 88 for hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 respectively when the ph of the solutions were 10 this tendency is understandable given the presence of chromium in various oxidation states and a constant change in the ph of the solution at a ph of between 1 6 chromium is likely found in the form of hydrogen chromate hcro4 whilst at a ph 7 it is preferably in the form of chromate cro2 4 in the neutral ph range cro4 2 hcro4 and cr2o7 2 are the expected forms of cr vi which dissolve easily azhar et al 2017 reported that the point of zero change phpzc from hkust 1 is 6 indicating that at a ph phpzc the adsorbent surface tends to be positively charged 27 the increase of the adsorption capacity below the neutral ph happens as a result of a strong electrostatic interaction between the positively charged hkust 1 adsorbent surface and the negatively charged adsorbate ion on the other hand the free energy of the adsorption of hcro4 namely between 2 5 to 0 6 kcal mol is lower to that of cro4 2 namely between 2 1 to 0 3 kcal mol as a result at similar conditions hcro4 is easier to adsorb than cro4 2 28 whereas at a ph 7 the adsorbent surface tends to be negatively charged this prevents an electrostatic interaction between the adsorbate and the adsorbent due to negation which in turn results in a decrease in the adsorption capacity value besides that there exists a competition between the oh ion originating from naoh at the time of the adjustment of ph with the cro4 2 ion 28 29 a similar thing happened in the research reported by maleki et al in which it was reported that the optimum ph of the chromium adsorption using hkust 1 was 7 26 3 3 2 effect of contact time the time taken to reach equilibrium is an important parameter in predicting the efficiency and feasibility of the adsorbents in controlling water pollution 30 the chromium adsorption process was done at a ph of 7 with an initial adsorbate concentration of 25 mg l the effect of contact time on chromium adsorption capacity for hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 adsorbents are shown in fig 8 the time profiles of the adsorption capacity for the two adsorbents were almost the same the adsorption capacity increased significantly when the contact time was less than 32 min indicating a fast interaction between chromium ions with active sites located on the surface of the adsorbents then the adsorption started to slow down before reaching complete adsorption equilibrium after 48 min in the range of between 32 and 48 min the surface of the adsorbents probably reached saturation thus the chromium ions penetrated into the pores and were adsorbed inside the pores at the equilibrium state all the surfaces of the adsorbents were fully covered by chromium ions and became saturated 31 3 3 3 effect of initial concentration the initial concentration of the adsorbate in a solution plays an important role during the uptake of pollutants from an aqueous solution by adsorption fig 9 shows the effect of initial cr vi concentrations in the range of 25 200 mg l with an increment of 25 mg l on the adsorption capacity of hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 adsorbents as can be seen at the initial cr vi concentration of 175 mg l the adsorption capacity of both adsorbents increased following the rise of the initial cr vi concentrations reaching a maximum value of 59 28 mg g and 67 85 mg g for hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 respectively the higher adsorption capacity of the hkust 1 s5 compared to that of hkust 1 s0 was related to the larger bet surface area of hkust 1 s5 3 4 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics studies provide information regarding the adsorption mechanism of adsorbents during the mass transport process the adsorption kinetics in this study was reviewed in terms of pseudo first order and pseudo second order in accordance to wang et al 2020 32 the pseudo first order kinetics equation describes the adsorption process on a solid liquid system which is based on the capacity of the solid eq 3 is the general equation of pseudo first order reaction kinetics 3 l n q e q t l n q e k 1 t where qe is the adsorption capacity at the equilibrium mg g qt is the adsorption capacity at a certain time of t mg g and k1 is the adsorption rate constant for pseudo first order 1 min from the graph plot of t minutes as the x axis versus ln qe qt as the y axis the k1 value is obtained from the slope of the linear equation whereas the calculated qe qecal is obtained from the exponential of the intercept the pseudo second order kinetics equation represents how the adsorbate depends on the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent rather than the adsorbate concentration the rate of the pseudo second order reaction depends on the amount of the substance adsorbed at the equilibrium the kinetics equation of the pseudo second order adsorption rate is written as eq 4 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the pseudo second order adsorption rate constant g mg min from the plot of t minutes as the x axis versus t qt as the y axis the value of the calculated qe qecal is obtained from 1 slope of the linear equation and k2 is obtained from slope2 intercept the suitability of the adsorption kinetics model is obtained from the value of the correlation coefficient r2 of the diagram closest to 1 the calculated parameters of the adsorption kinetics study are shown in table 3 the plots of pseudo first and pseudo second order reactions are available in fig s1 and fig s2 it can be seen that the correlation coefficient r2 of the pseudo second order plots for both adsorbents has a higher value compared to the pseudo first order plots this indicates that adsorption of cr vi follows the pseudo second order adsorption kinetics models 33 it should be noted that the pseudo second order adsorption kinetics model is derived from the assumption that the limit of the adsorption rate depends on the chemical adsorption process based on the data in table 3 it can be seen that the values of the adsorption capacity calculated in pseudo second order adsorption kinetics are similar to the values of the experimental adsorption capacity values these results reinforce the suitability of pseudo second order adsorption model in the process of adsorption of chromium ions using hkust 1 adsorbents 34 in addition to r2 another parameter that is also calculated from the diagram is the pseudo second order adsorption kinetic constant k2 as shown in table 3 the k2 of hkust 1 s5 0 003 g mg 1 min 1 is greater than that of hkust 1 0 0016 g mg 1 min 1 which indicates that hkust 1 s5 adsorbents has a faster cr vi adsorption rate 3 5 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherms of cr vi on both hkust 1 and hkust 1 s5 adsorbents were obtained after adsorption for 48 min in solutions with various cr vi concentrations the chromium concentration is related to the number of active sites on the surface of the adsorbent that can bind anion the correlation between the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents and the concentration of cr vi at equilibrium are shown in figs s3 s6 where the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherms are applied to fit the equilibrium data the langmuir adsorption isotherm equation can be theoretically derived by assuming a balance between the molecules of the substance adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent and the molecules of the non adsorbed substance the langmuir equation assumes that adsorption takes place on specific surfaces of homogeneous adsorbents in addition only a single layer is formed in the langmuir isotherm at maximum adsorption each atom is only adsorbed at a certain point on the surface of the adsorbent and each part of the surface can only hold one molecule or atom the langmuir adsorption isotherm equation is written as eq 5 5 1 q e 1 q m 1 q m k l c e where qe mg g is the amount of adsorbate per unit mass of adsorbent and ce mg l is the concentration of adsorbate at equilibrium both qm mg g and kl l mg are the langmuir constants from the plot of 1 ce as the x axis and 1 qe as the y axis the value of qm maximum adsorption capacity is obtained from 1 intercept and the kl value the langmuir constant is obtained from intercept slope the freundlich isotherm equation is based on the assumption that adsorbents have heterogeneous surfaces and that each molecule has different absorption capabilities the freundlich isothermal adsorption equation is written as eq 6 6 l n q e l n k f 1 n l n c e where the kf value is the freundlich isotherm constant l mg qe is the amount of molecules adsorbed in each gram of adsorbent or adsorbent capacity ce is the adsorbate concentration after adsorption and 1 n is the adsorption intensity the value of 1 n ranges between 0 1 reflecting the heterogeneity of the surface by plotting lnce as the x axis versus lnqe as the y axis the value of kf the freundlich constant is obtained from the exponential of intercept temkin isotherm takes into account factors that are explicitly related to the interaction between adsorbents and adsorbates by ignoring the very low or high concentration values this model assumes that the energy or heat of adsorption of all molecules in the layer decreases linearly with increasing coverage due to the adsorbent adsorbate interactions from the rejection of adsorbate adsorbate the adsorbed adsorbates are evenly distributed between layers 35 as implied in the equation the derivation of this model can be characterized by an even distribution of the binding energy up to a certain maximum binding energy which is determined by plotting the amount absorbed qe against lnce eq 7 is the linear equation of the temkin isothermal adsorption 7 q e r t b l n k t r t b ln c e where t is the absolute temperature r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k b is the constant related to the heat of adsorption whose value can be determined from the slope and intercept kt is an equilibrium binding constant l mg which depends on the maximum binding energy of the adsorbate and the adsorbent the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm is generally used to describe the adsorption mechanism with gaussian energy distribution on heterogeneous surfaces the assumption of this model is that the adsorption has a multi layered character involves van der waals forces and applies physical adsorption processes isothermal d r can be used to estimate the average free adsorption energy e if the e value is less than 8 kj mol then physical adsorption applies however if e is between 8 kj mol and 16 kj mol then the chemical ion exchange mechanism applies if the value is higher than 16 kj mol then the adsorption mechanism is dominated by the diffusion of chemical particles 35 the d r isothermal adsorption model is represented linearly as follows 8 8 l n q e l n q s k a d x ε 2 where qe is the amount of adsorbate on adsorbent at equilibrium mg g qs is the theoretical isothermal saturation capacity mg g and kad is the dubinin radushkevich isothermal adsorption constant mol2 kj2 ε is the dubinin radushkevich isothermal constant which can be determined using eq 9 9 ε r t ln 1 1 c e where t is the absolute temperature the value of qs and kad can be calculated from the intercept and slope of the plots of lnqe versus ε2 whilst e can be calculated using the following eq 10 10 e 1 2 k a d the isotherm parameters obtained from the adsorption of cr vi onto hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 are presented in table s1 as shown in table s1 the calculated e values according to the d r isotherm modelling are 28 867 and 31 622 kj mol for hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 respectively indicating that the adsorption mechanism is dominated by chemical particle diffusion table 4 summarizes the correlation coefficient the r2 values and the adsorption kinetics constants kl and kf obtained from the two isotherm models for the adsorption of cr vi onto hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 results from the previous studies are included for comparison based on the r2 values the langmuir isotherm model gave higher r2 values of 0 984 and 0 991 for hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 respectively compared to the r2 values of 0 930 and 0 947 for hkust 1 s0 and hkust 1 s5 respectively obtained from the freundlich isotherm model the results revealed that the adsorption system of cr vi by the two adsorbents was found to better fit the langmuir isotherm model which indicated that adsorption occurred in a monolayer and at the same surface energy level with chemical interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate 36 the langmuir isotherm model observed for the adsorption system of cr vi with hkust 1 was also reported by maleki et al 2015 26 the use of other adsorbents for adsorption of cr vi such as uio66 nh2 13 and zif 8 14 were also fit to the langmuir and freundlich isothermal model table 4 in the case of the maximum adsorption capacity qmax value obtained from the langmuir isotherm model the adsorbent hkust 1 s5 showed a higher qmax value 100 mg g than that of hkust 1 s0 90 9 mg g this result should be correlated with the formation of larger pores on hkust 1 s5 which is due to the addition of ctabr during the synthesis process this allowed the adsorbate molecules to diffuse easier into the adsorbent pores when comparing the results of various studies on cr vi adsorption in aqueous solution shown in table 5 the use of hkust 1 as an adsorbent in this study shows a higher adsorption capacity value than other mof adsorbents used in other studies such as uio 66 nh2 10 and zif 8 11 3 6 adsorption mechanism adsorption of cr vi in the solution onto the hkust 1 adsorbent is considered to follow several mechanisms namely 1 filling of the adsorbent pore surface 2 electrostatic interaction and 3 ion exchange in this study adsorbents with a larger pore structure were likely to adsorb more chromium ions with the assistance of the hypercamp 8 0 software the size of the molecules are calculated to be 3 18 0 21 7 05 å3 3 38 0 25 3 74 å3 and 3 48 0 24 4 16 å3 for cr2o7 2 cro4 2 and hcro4 respectively the hkust 1 s5 material has the biggest pore size 2 18 nm therefore the diffusion of adsorbent molecules interacts easier on the pore surface of the adsorbents which in turn causes a high value of adsorption capacity furthermore electrostatic interactions occurred on the terminal hydroxyl group in hkust 1 with chromium ions contributing to the increase in the adsorption capacity apart from that the condition of the adsorption ph that is done below phpzc causes the surface of the material to be positively charged which in turn can increase the electrostatic interaction with the adsorbents that are negatively charged cro4 2 hcro4 and cr2o7 2 28 29 in addition the presence of electrons π in the hkust 1 framework were able to reduce cr vi ions into cr iii ions and released in the solution the cr iii ions were either adsorbed by the acidic site of the hkust 1 adsorbent or experienced precipitation in the form of chromium hydroxide 29 40 4 conclusion in this study hkust 1 materials were successfully synthesized using the solvothermal method in a solvent mixture of water ethanol and dmf with an equal volume ratio the mother liquor from the first synthesis was successfully reused as the solvent for the subsequent hkust 1 synthesis processes up to four repetitions this study on the adsorption of hkust 1 on cr vi in aqueous solution showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 91 mg g for the first hkust 1 material and 100 mg g for the fifth hkust 1 material both hkust 1 materials followed the pseudo second order adsorption kinetics with a langmuir isothermal adsorption model from the fact that the reuse of mother liquor for up to four times results in the formation of hkust 1 with the highest adsorption capacity shows that the mother liquor can be reused as solvent for subsequent synthesis processes this reduces the amount of solvent used which is in accordance to a

13693,magnetization facilitates the separation and reuse of adsorbents but significantly reduces the adsorption capacity in this study a double layer magnetized functionalized biochar composite was synthesized through a hybrid post pyrolysis magnetization which sustained and even significantly increased the adsorption capacity of microporous carbonaceous biochar bc the developed process included i structural modification of biochar under ultrasound waves ii magnetization with magnetite fe3o4 nanoparticles and iii functionalization with 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane tes ultrasound irradiation exfoliates and breaks apart the irregular graphite layers of biochar and creates new or opens blocked micropores thus enhancing the bc s porosity for its part tes stabilizes the magnetic nanoparticles on the biochar surface while it participates in water decontamination through the strong chelation ability of its amino groups toward metal ions scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the stable and uniform distribution of fe3o4 nanoparticles on the surface of microporous biochar and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated effective surface functionalization in addition although magnetization usually reduces the porosity of carbonaceous adsorbents the ultraviolet visible spectroscopic analysis showed that double layer magnetic biochar composite exhibited a much greater ability to remove ni ii and pb ii with 139 and 38 higher adsorptions than raw biochar almost complete removal of pb 91 was observed by magnetic bc and the adsorbent could easily be separated using a neodymium magnet this high performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of ultrasound activation on increasing the porosity and surface area of biochar along with enhanced chelation imparted by amine functionalization the developed technique can be used for synthesizing advanced adsorbents for removal of nuclear waste related metal ions from aqueous environments keywords biochar ultrasound activation magnetization adsorption heavy metal water treatment 1 introduction owing to the rapid boom in industrialization the proper treatment of the heavy metals from industrial wastewater has become of monumental importance 1 heavy metals are readily soluble in aquatic environs and once these connect up to food or drinking water chain considerable concentrations can accumulate inside the human body which can be lethal if allowed to go beyond tolerable limits 2 3 nickel and lead which are used in manufacturing processes of batteries super alloys and smelting of sulfide ores are considered to be severely toxic even at low concentrations in addition to such common metal ions efficient removal of toxic nuclear waste related metal ions is another important application of adsorbents from the environmental standpoint biosorbents and activated carbons are good adsorbents for these metal ions but compared to biochar bc are relatively expensive biochar the solid byproduct of biomass pyrolysis with a microporous carbonaceous structure has been increasingly recognized as an efficient adsorbent for a vast number of pollutants surface area porosity and functionality of biochar govern the sorption capacity and the sorption mechanisms involved generally pore size and the surface area tends to increase with pyrolysis temperature the dehydration process due to water loss during pyrolysis generates pores of different sizes of nano 0 9 nm micro 2 nm and macro 50 nm regardless of their charges or polarity biochar with relatively small pore size is inefficient in trapping large sorbates 4 in general the micro and mesopores are more important in the removal of metal ions 5 in addition the application performance of biochar is closely related to the quantity and types of functional groups the three n functional groups pyrrolic n pyridinic n and graphitic n are related to catalysis of oxygen reduction while amine n influenced the adsorption of metal ions and co2 therefore better performance is corresponding to the abundance of active n functional groups and the increase in the nitrogen content of biochar 6 surface amination is among the most common methods to introduce amino groups into biochar the addition of basic amino groups to the surface is a promising method for increasing the efficiency of biochar in adsorption of carbon dioxide and metal ions to reach this objective three different methods can be applied surface amination through i nitration by ammonia ii nitration by amino containing reagents iii combination of nitration and reduction 7 a hindrance to these ongoing advancements in metal ion adsorption has been biochar recovery after wastewater treatment time consuming steps like centrifugation and filtration are unlikely to be efficient in large scale applications the magnetization of biochar has provided a novel approach allowing practical use of small particle size adsorbents which have high surface areas and fast adsorption kinetics high performance magnetically separable adsorbent is also a readily applicable technology which would reduce the harmful impacts of nuclear waste related metal ions and radioactive material on human health and the environment e g fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster after a 9 0 magnitude earthquake on march 2011 in which large amounts of water were contaminated with radioactive isotopes with the use of a magnet magnetic biochar can be easily and quickly separated after adsorbing heavy metal contaminants from water this makes either batch or stirred processes a viable option while also overcoming the drawbacks caused by filtration of small particle size adsorbents and delivering faster adsorption kinetics 8 magnetic biochar can also effectively be used in the removal of inorganic anions antibiotics pesticides organic dyes nuclear materials and other organic pollutants from aqueous solution or wastewaters 9 10 impregnation co precipitation and liquid reduction are the most common methods that have been used to prepare magnetic biochar impregnation includes mixing the biomass with a ferric or ferrous chloride precursor solution and subsequent pyrolysis of the obtained biomass in an inert environment under high temperature this single step pyrolysis of fecl3 loaded biomass can produce biochar with magnetic properties but simultaneously produces secondary pollution is costly and may not address any desired functional group on biochar surface 11 liu et al 12 developed a fe3o4 loaded magnetic biochar with a spinel structure magnetite fe3o4 or maghemite γ fe2o3 using a mixture of fecl3 and biomass in a pyrolysis process under the flow of nitrogen n2 gas at 600 c for almost 3 h the composite exhibiting a large surface area of 349 m2 g and was effective for as v adsorption a similar method has been used by other researchers to produce well crystallined magnetic biochar 13 14 however surface functional groups which support adsorption through complexation become limited via this process as they react with iron in various oxidation reactions during pyrolysis reducing biochar s heavy metal adsorption capacity significantly 15 16 the magnetization of biochar has typically been achieved through the traditional method of chemical co precipitation with magnetite fe3o4 15 17 in this process iron oxides of magnetic nature are precipitated directly onto the biochar with the use of biocarbon and a mixed fe2 fe3 salt solution these iron compounds have been used individually or in unison to impart magnetism on the biochar 18 19 the liquid phase reduction method comprises mixing the biocarbon with fe2 salt solution and then reducing fe2 to zero valent iron on the biochar surface using a reducing agent nabh4 kbh4 philippou et al 20 investigated the fabrication of magnetic biochar pncm and fe3o4 loaded oxidized biochar pncom using pine needles as a precursor in a co precipitation process the results showed better adsorptive properties for pncom particularly in the acidic ph range however the co precipitation and liquid phase reduction can reduce the porosity of biochar due to the aggregation of iron oxides in the aqueous solution this results in a decrease in the surface area and hence the adsorption capability of biochar 21 even with the optimum amount of doping the decrease in heavy metal adsorption is prevalent to reap the benefits of magnetic separation overcoming these drawbacks is crucial 22 recently more complicated magnetic biochar structures have been synthesized using electrostatic attraction cui et al 23 developed a core shell γ al2o3 fe3o4 biochar afbc through electrostatic attraction and inner sphere complexation afbc represented a high phosphorus recovery and excellent stability nanoscale colloidal iron oxide fe3o4 nanoparticles nps that exhibit superparamagnetic properties at ambient temperatures can deliver magnetic property to the carbonaceous structures however bare fe3o4 nanoparticles are easily aggregated and reduce the porosity if they are directly precipitated on carbon structure 24 the fe3o4 nps may also be detached once the adsorbent comes in contact with water in order to overcome these drawbacks a homogenous loading and immobilization of magnetic nanoparticles on into carbon structure has been regarded as an efficient method to increase the stability of nps yet delivering the magnetic property while the original porosity of the structure is also maintained to reach these objectives physical activation of carbon structure using ultrasound waves and simultaneous immobilization functionalization is proposed in this research work this study proposes a novel magnetization process to synthesize a double layer functionalized magnetic biochar composite tes fe3o4 biochar through a three step process i physical activation of biochar under ultrasound irradiation us bc ii magnetization of sono activated biochar with fe3o4 nanoparticles usmbc and iii functionalization of usmbc with 3 triethoxysilyl propylamine tes activating biochar bc with ultrasound us irradiation which include disarrangement and exfoliation of bc s graphitic structure mineral leaching and a significant increase in bc s porosity significant increase in bc s internal surface area creation of new and opening of blocked mesopores and enhanced carbon and hydrogen content of biochar 25 all these phenomena provide more room for magnetic nanoparticles functional groups and subsequently adsorption capacity tes improve the stability of fe3o4 nanoparticles fe np on the biochar surface and increase adsorption sites functional groups for heavy metals the process suggested not only facilitates biochar removal after heavy metal adsorption but also increases its adsorption capacity this study investigates the synergisms of ultrasound activation fe3o4 loading and tes functionalization with respect to adsorption rates of nickel and lead 2 materials and methods

g of the synthesized biochar composite was added to a 50 ml solution of 100 mg l ni2 or pb2 and was stirred in a shaker for varying durations 30 min 1 2 4 and 6 h after which the biochar was separated from the solution first using strong neodymium magnets fig 2 a and further by filtration the metal ion concentration of the filtrate was determined through uv vis spectroscopy dr6000 hach using the respective standard kits tnt856 for nickel using dimethylglyoxime method and tnt850 for lead using par method for the former nickel ions react with dimethylglyoxime in an alkaline solution to form an orange brown complex the measurement wavelength is 463 nm in the latter lead ii ions react at ph 9 with 4 2 pyridylazo resorcinol par to form a red complex the measurement wavelength is 520 nm metal concentrations were greater than the measuring range therefore the samples were first diluted with distilled water to prevent precipitation in the vial 2 2 4 kinetic studies the equilibrium adsorption capacities for ni ii and pb ii were calculated according to q e c 0 c e v m where c0 ce v and m are the initial and the residual concentration of metal ions in the solution mg l 1 the volume of heavy metal solution ml and the amount of adsorbents mg respectively in addition both the pseudo first order ln q e q t l n q e k 1 t and pseudo second order t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t equations were used to model the adsorption kinetics where qt and qe mg g are the amount of metal ion adsorbed per gram of adsorbent at time t and at equilibrium respectively k1 min 1 and k2 g mg min are the rate constants for the pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption models respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 mechanism of chemical activation of biochar np with tes the co precipitation process has a well known mechanism as represented by eq 1 3 this process can synthesize nanoparticle sizes in the range above 10 nm 1 f e 2 2 o h f e o h 2 2 f e 3 3 o h f e o h 3 3 f e o h 2 2 f e o h 3 f e 3 o 4 4 h 2 o though loading the magnetic fe3o4 on the surface fig 3 def delivers magnetization properties to the biochar matrix some magnetic nanoparticles may be detached when the biochar comes in contact with aqueous solutions the main objectives of tes addition include stabilizing the fe3o4 nanoparticles fe np preventing the dissociation of fe nps from the biochar thereby improving the reusability of the adsorbent and increasing the quantity of nitrogen containing functional groups for enhanced adsorption of metal ions fig 2b tes can be attached to the porous structure of biochar either through impregnation using weak van der waals forces 32 or grafting using strong covalent bonds to the biochar s functional groups theoretically surface functionalization with tes should afford a homogeneous coupling as surface oh groups replace the ethoxy groups on tes fig 2b 29 30 however hydrogen bonding between surface oh and silanols amino groups may also happen fig 1 30 the amine functional groups of tes can increase the adsorption capacity due to complexation with heavy metals 7 33 cu ii ni ii and pb ii strongly bind to amine groups weaker binding has been observed between amine containing sites and cd ii or zn ii however they still prefer amine sites to pure carboxylates no preference has been observed for ca ii binding with amine compared to carboxylate ligand groups indicating ca ii is bound by more negatively charged molecules 34 amine groups also effectively participate in the adsorption of cr vi amination with 3 aminopropyltrimethoxysilane aptms which is analogous to tes increases the cr vi uptake of mesoporous silica from 36 95 mg g to 83 50 mg g 35 bamdad et al 29 applied two different chemical methods for amine functionalization of biochar including i nitration using concentrated nitric acid followed by reduction and ii condensation of tes on the surface though the authors concluded that a moderate thermal activation is needed after amination tes aminated biochar indicated a higher co2 adsorption capacity compared to nitration reduction 3 2 physical activation of biochar table 1 shows the surface area and total pore volumes of raw ultrasound activated and magnetized functionalized biochars using different loadings of fe np and tes concentrations the specific surface area of bcs was calculated using the brunauer emmett teller bet and harkins and jura equations the impact of ultrasound activation on increasing the micro porosity and surface area of bc has recently been proved as an effective method for the physical activation of biochar this effect is mainly attributed to ultrasound induced cavitation and its implications in addition the explosion of cavitation bubbles and generation of micro jets can create a regular pattern of new pores into onto the biochar surface which is visible in sem images fig 3b vs a as a result the bet surface area of raw biochar increased from 219 98 261 67 m2 g after only 30 s of bc exposure to ultrasound irradiation on the other hand the mesopore surface area reduced from 96 54 68 45 m2 g due to the partial conversion of mesopores to micropores in other words many macropores are broken down into micropores enhancing the overall surface with more porosities as expected the loading of nanoparticles and tes functionalization reduced micro and mesoporosity of biochar and lowered its surface area by 13 which may cause a reduction in the adsorption capacity yet exposure to 60 s of ultrasound activation could sustain much of the bet surface area when bc was magnetized and functionalized with a loss of only 2 compared with raw bc further porosity reduction was observed by increasing the concentration of tes or maximizing the loading of nanoparticles accordingly the minimum bet surface areas of 182 15 and 181 65 m2 g were observed for the samples containing either the maximum loading of fe np us30 bc fe 1 1 tes5 or tes us30 bc fe 2 1 tes15 the sem images also demonstrate the increased partial coating of biochar surface with tes and a uniform distribution of fe np on bc surface fig 3d f edx analysis of the biochar surface fig 3g h shows the elemental percentage composition of c o fe and si on the surfaces of magnetized and magnetized functionalized biochar before tes treatment fe from the nanoparticles is detected after tes the si that coats the nanoparticles is detected instead 3 2 1 effect of physicochemical magnetization on elemental composition of biochar table 2 lists the elemental c h n s o and fe and ash contents of raw and double layer magnetized functionalized biochar composites as observed the ultrasound activation of biochar increases the c content of biochar which is consistent with our previous works ultrasound cavitation and its implications e g micro jets hot spots shock waves etc can exfoliate the graphitic structure of biochar and facilitate the leaching of mineral compounds ash content which subsequently increases the portion of organic compounds in the biochar structure in addition the results show that ultrasound activation slightly reduced the oxygen content of biochar presumably through the removal of some of the oxygen containing functional groups 25 26 upon magnetization and loading of fe3o4 nanoparticles the fe and o contents of the samples increased as expected ultrasound activation also affects the loading of fe3o4 nanoparticles as observed unsonicated us0 bc fe 2 1 tes 5 contained the least fe 3 8 content of the magnetized samples however ultrasonication increased the fe content to 7 93 and 6 56 for us30 bc fe 2 1 tes5 and us60 bc fe2 1 tes5 respectively compared to the sonicated magnetized bc samples us0 bc fe 2 1 tes5 compensated for its low fe with a higher quantity of c h and n the higher porosity and surface area of the sonicated samples allows the subsequent incorporation of a higher quantity of fe np into the biochar structure which lowers the of other elements as expected increasing the ratio of bc to magnetic nanoparticles reduced their loading and hence o declined however fe content showed an increase which is against our expectations it should be explained that different combustion analyzers and therefore different samples are used for the analysis of c h n s o and fe this paradox between the o and fe trends could be due to the agglomeration of nanoparticles in some samples 24 to probe such paradoxes we synthesized three sets of samples and analyzed the elements three times the last section of the table focuses on the effect of tes concentration during the process of functionalization as observed n and ash contents significantly increased with tes concentration from 5 to 15 ml l the maximum n content was observed for us 30 bc fe 2 1 tes15 3 2 2 effect of physiochemical magnetization on functional groups of biochar the effects of magnetization and tes functionalization on functional groups of double layer biochar composites under different conditions as indicated by their ftir spectra are provided in fig 4 data were analyzed by origin software figs 1 3 supplementary the wide band at 3300 3600 cm 1 represents the stretching vibration of the hydrogen bonded hydroxyl group 36 the intensification of this bond was significantly reduced due to ultrasound activation most likely due to the loss of oh and cooh functional groups this is consistent with our elemental analysis which confirms the reduction of o and h containing groups and our previous studies according to the literature the most prominent features of tes are located between 740 1250 cm 1 37 39 accordingly the characteristic peak at 765 795 cm 1 corresponds to the si c vibration 39 40 or sio c 41 suggesting that the organic alkyl chains are covalently bonded to the si o si networks 40 42 the other two peaks at 952 cm 1 and 1110 cm 1 were assigned to the si o c bond 39 41 and si o si stretching 40 43 41 respectively herein referred to as the si o x region these two peaks can confirm the coating of the magnetite surface through the silanization reaction with hydrolysis of et o si bonds to make horizontal si o si links between tes groups fig 2b the silica network is adsorbed on the surface by si o c bonds fig 1 41 44 the peak at 1100 cm 1 is associated with either the stretching vibration of co bonds in the bc structure cn of the incorporated c nh2 bond 39 or si o c or si o si bonds 45 the observed si corresponding bands prove that tes was successfully grafted onto the magnetized biochar the other new peak exhibited at 1580 1620 cm 1 was assigned to the nh bending of the nh2 amine group 45 41 the peak around 2100 cm 1 is likely an overtone of the 1050 region and the peak at 2300 cm 1 is co2 there could be some overlap between the peaks as an instance a peak that is observed 1047 cm 1 could also be associated with si o fe stretching vibrations 42 in addition the two peaks valued at 1635 and 575 cm 1 are assigned to symmetrical and anti symmetrical fe o vibrations 42 46 47 and a small peak next to it at around 665 cm 1 can result from the feooh stretching vibration which usually appears in activated carbon modified by fe3 48 49 it may also have some overlap with o si o asymmetric flexing 50 the presence of these two strong bonds in all magnetized samples suggests the attachment of magnetic nanoparticles to the biochar upon magnetization and functionalization the intensity of fe o 575 cm 1 and si o x 700 1200 peaks cm 1 significantly increased among the first group of peaks which reflects the effect of structural modification using ultrasound irradiation the highest intensities of these peaks were observed for the highest duration of ultrasound activation the ftir spectra of magnetization using different loadings of fe3o4 nanoparticles are represented in maroon color in fig 4 as expected the highest fe o peak at 575 cm 1 was observed for us30 bc fe 1 1 tes since an equal quantity of biochar and fe nanoparticles were used in the activation process the intensity of this peak gradually decreased with the reduction of fe np loading another important observation is that not only fe o peak but also the si o x peaks were significantly higher in us30 bc fe 1 1 tes5 which can be due to the increased attachment of tes into this sample however it does not necessarily improve the adsorption capacity of biochar as this capability is a resultant of a combination of phenomena including physical adoption surface complexation inner sphere complexation etc higher fe and tes loading reduces the surface area and porosity of biochar which may negatively affect its adsorption capacity the lines highlighted in the blue color of fig 4 demonstrate the effect of different tes concentrations in the amination step the intensity of ftir peaks of si o x and fe o increased with tes concentration up to 10 ml however no further increase in the intensity of peaks was observed for the higher tes dose of 15 ml which is consistent with the trend of fe and n contents in the samples 3 2 3 effect of physiochemical magnetization on graphitic structure of biochar fig 5 a shows the raman spectra of the biochars activated and functionalized under different ultrasound irradiation and tes loading the spectra were recorded with a linear laser excitation of 532 nm and the baselines were revised in general their spectra share common features at around 1000 1529 1500 1775 and 2800 cm 1 the so called d g and 2d peaks respectively the d band or disorder induced peak is attributed to in plane vibrations of sp2 bonded carbon within structural defects amorphous or disordered graphite the d band has a low intensity in well organized carbonaceous materials and graphite however it becomes similar in intensity to the g band for more disordered carbons such as biochar the g band stretching carbon carbon sp2 bonds arises from the in plane vibrations of the sp2 bonded carbon in graphitic crystallites the intensity ratio between the d and g band id ig is a measure of defects in graphite based materials the comparable intensity of d band and g band with an intensity ratio ranging from 0 46 to 0 72 indicates that biochar is made of a high quantity of ordered and disordered graphitic carbons the 2d band also known as g band is the second order overtone of the d band and is the result of a two phonon lattice vibrational process but unlike the d band it does not need to be activated by proximity to a defect the 2d band is usually used to determine graphene layer thickness it is much sharper and more intense in the single layer graphene than in multi layer graphene according to the raman results and as expected the biochar structure involves mainly multi layer graphene graphitic structure it has been reported that the intensity of the g band increases with the number of graphene layers for thin samples up to 7 layers and then decreases with the further increase of the number of layers 23 40 layers and graphite fig 5b 51 raw chars usually contain clusters of 4 6 parallel graphene and graphitic oxide sheets 52 53 therefore reduced intensity of g peak can also be related to the exfoliation and reduction of biochar layers due to ultrasound activation in addition a lower intensity of d and g bands in ultrasound activated sample us30 can indicate that the size of the crystallites decreases this is consistent with our observation confirming the reduced biochar s particle size upon ultrasound activation the intensity of d and g peaks decreased upon magnetization and functionalization without ultrasonication this indicates an increasing roughness and thickness of crystals due to the partial coating of the surface however the intensity of the id ig ratio increased with ultrasound activation duration from 0 56 for us0 bs fe 2 1 tes5 to 0 72 for us60 bs fe 2 1 tes5 and was greatest with the lowest tes dosage of 5 ml 3 3 heavy metal adsorption studies 3 3 1 ultrasound activation effect fig 6 presents the performances of raw and the double layer magnetized functionalized biochar composite in adsorption of nickel and lead ions all adsorption tests were conducted two times as observed raw biochar can remove only 14 of nickel and 67 of lead ions generally the removal of pb2 ions in aqueous solution is easier than ni2 ions 54 the ionic radius electronegativity covalent bond strength and the hydration properties of the metal ions are the principal properties used in the interpretation of heavy metal adsorption mechanisms 55 structures with a smaller hydrated radius and higher electronegativity have more potential for surface complexation or adsorption reactions 55 the degree of hydration of metal ions depends on the ratio of charge electrostatic charge to volume a lower number of water molecules hydrate the larger ions that have smaller charges per volume pb ii ions have a larger ionic radius than ni ii ions 0 119 vs 0 069 nm however the hydrated radius of pb ii ions is smaller than that of ni ii ions 0 401 nm vs 0 404 nm 56 the ion with the smaller hydrated radius should be adsorbed more strongly on the other hand stronger covalent bonds should be formed with more electronegative metals lead 2 33 is more electronegative than nickel 1 91 the combination of higher electronegativity and a smaller hydration radius ensures a higher covalent bond between the lead ion and the electron donor of the adsorbent surface compared to nickel 54 57 short term physical activation of biochar with ultrasound irradiation increased the nickel removal to 25 and lead removal to 78 this improvement was caused by the ultrasound cavitation and its implications which subsequently increased the surface area and porosity of bc additionally micro jets can generate new pores and open some of the blocked pores which not only increases the porosity of biochar but also makes channels to the underlayers of biochar where some functional groups are secluded these effects also favor the magnetization and functionalization steps magnetization usually decreases the adsorption capacity of biochar however comparing the adsorption results of us0 bc fe 2 1 tes5 to raw bc demonstrates the contribution of amine functionalization following magnetization which not only prevented overall reduction of metal removal but even slightly increased the adsorption capacity of biochar ultrasound activation of biochar prior to magnetization and functionalization further increased the metal removal given the fact that the maximum nickel and lead removal without ultrasound was 17 and 79 for us0 bc fe 2 1 tes5 a significant increase of ni and pb adsorption to 32 and 90 respectively for us60 bc fe 2 1 tes5 is attributed to the structural modification accompanying ultrasound irradiation 3 3 2 magnetization effect the magnetization process was conducted using three different bc fe ratios of 1 1 2 1 and 3 1 for nickel the lowest the nanoparticle loading corresponded to the greatest the adsorption capacity the reduction of biochar s adsorption capacity with nanoparticle loading is mainly due to the nanoparticles reducing the surface area and the porosity of biochar therefore among the three fe3o4 loadings with 30 s of ultrasound pre activation the maximum ni ii adsorption of 28 was observed for us30 bc fe 3 1 tes5 which contained the lowest quantity of fe3o4 nanoparticles the value further increased to 32 for longer ultrasonication us60 bc fe 3 1 tes5 moreover longer ultrasound activation significantly reduced the adsorption time increased the adsorption rate in other words fig s2 the highest amount of nickel was removed by us60 bc fe 3 1 tes5 within only 2 h in terms of lead removal the highest absorption was observed for us30 bc fe 2 1 tes5 rather than for us30 bc fe 3 1 tes5 however in this case the sample containing the highest fe np loading us30 bc fe 1 1 tes5 displayed the least adsorption 3 3 3 functionalization effect among samples with us30 and 2 1 bce fe loading the highest adsorption of both ni ii and pb ii was observed for the sample containing the lowest tes loading us30 bc fe2 1 tes5 further increasing the tes concentration reduced the adsorption capacity of the activated biochars this can be due to the significant impact of chemical functionalization in reducing the surface area and porosity of adsorbent particularly in terms of ni ii adsorption however the contradictory impact of tes in increasing the removal of pb ii can be noticed by comparing the results of us30 78 and us30 bc fe 2 1 tes5 89 it is worth noting to mention that this project was initially conducted by direct precipitation of fe3o4 on the usbc surface without any functionalization not covered in the manuscript which caused a significant reduction in the adsorption capacity of biochar this could be mainly due to the reduction in surface area and porosity of biochar however it also suggested that fe3o4 did not make a significant contribution to the adsorption process therefore the increase in adsorption capacity of tes functionalized magnetic usbc suggests a determinant role of chemisorption by the amino groups of tes in pb removal such a prominent capability of tes in removal of lead and other heavy metals has also been reported by other researchers 58 for example kong et al 59 functionalized the surface of silica nanoparticles by three silane coupling agents including 3 mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane mptes and tes and compared their performances on the removal of pb ii cu ii hg ii cd ii and zn ii tes functionalized silica nanoparticles sio2 tes exhibited maximum removal efficiency towards pb2 and hg2 shi et al 60 also synthesized magnetic biochar in three steps including preparation of carboxylated biochar synthesis of fe3o4 sio2 nh2 particles from fe3o4 particles modified with teos and tes via the stober method and then conjugation of the fe3o4 sio2 nh2 with the carboxylated biochar by forming amide bonds via the classic edc nhs coupling the cr vi ion adsorption capacity of their magnetic biochar was 27 2 mg g 1 surpassing the original carboxylated biochar 18 2 mg g 1 compared to their work the method developed in this study is much simpler in addition the focus of the current work is promoting the adsorption and functionalization capability of biochar rather than using it as a carrier or support and the final difference of this study over the other similar works is that ph as a master variable in adsorption of heavy metals was not adjusted in this study and the adsorption was conducted on the inherent ph of the solution 3 4 kinetic and the equilibrium adsorption based on the analysis presented in figs s2 s3 and tables s1 s2 supplementary information the pseudo second order model was generally more suitable for explaining the behavior of pb ii adsorption into magnetized biochar indicating that the reaction is more inclined towards chemisorption due to the impact of functional groups on biochar surface rather than physisorption the pseudo second order plots were also superior for ni ii adsorption however the pseudo first order plots also showed reasonable r values 0 9 for 2 3 of the sonicated ni samples suggesting an impact for both physisorption and chemisorption in ni removal however most of the metal removal was accomplished during the early stage of adsorption 30 min out of 6 h the difference between the calculated and experimental values of adsorption capacities shows that a more number of data points is needed from during the early stages of adsorption 4 conclusion this study introduced a post pyrolysis ultrasound based magnetization process to produce the double layer magnetic tes functionalized biochar according to ftir analysis the most prominent features of tes are located between 740 1250 cm 1 si c vibration si o c peak and si o si stretching which can confirm the coating of the magnetite surface through the silanization reaction and the formation of silica network on the bc surface by si o c bonds the adsorption results demonstrated that while raw biochar could remove only 13 and 68 of ni ii and pb ii with some signs of leaching the biochar activated under 60 s of ultrasound irradiation magnetized with fe3o4 in the ratio of 2 1 and functionalized with the lowest concentration of tes exhibited 32 and 90 of ni and pb removal without any leaching the highest adsorption capacity was associated with the maximum ultrasound activation of 60 s which suggests the impact of porosity and surface area on the subsequent functionalization and the removal of metal ions although the low concentration of tes increased the adsorption capacity high tes concentrations adversely affected the adsorption capacity due to the reduction of surface area and porosity kinetic studies suggest that pb ii adsorption is more inclined towards chemisorption while both physisorption and chemisorption contribute to ni removal the bulk of the biochar could be separated from water by application of a neodymium magnet even at the lowest fe np loading of bc fe 3 1

13693,magnetization facilitates the separation and reuse of adsorbents but significantly reduces the adsorption capacity in this study a double layer magnetized functionalized biochar composite was synthesized through a hybrid post pyrolysis magnetization which sustained and even significantly increased the adsorption capacity of microporous carbonaceous biochar bc the developed process included i structural modification of biochar under ultrasound waves ii magnetization with magnetite fe3o4 nanoparticles and iii functionalization with 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane tes ultrasound irradiation exfoliates and breaks apart the irregular graphite layers of biochar and creates new or opens blocked micropores thus enhancing the bc s porosity for its part tes stabilizes the magnetic nanoparticles on the biochar surface while it participates in water decontamination through the strong chelation ability of its amino groups toward metal ions scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the stable and uniform distribution of fe3o4 nanoparticles on the surface of microporous biochar and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated effective surface functionalization in addition although magnetization usually reduces the porosity of carbonaceous adsorbents the ultraviolet visible spectroscopic analysis showed that double layer magnetic biochar composite exhibited a much greater ability to remove ni ii and pb ii with 139 and 38 higher adsorptions than raw biochar almost complete removal of pb 91 was observed by magnetic bc and the adsorbent could easily be separated using a neodymium magnet this high performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of ultrasound activation on increasing the porosity and surface area of biochar along with enhanced chelation imparted by amine functionalization the developed technique can be used for synthesizing advanced adsorbents for removal of nuclear waste related metal ions from aqueous environments keywords biochar ultrasound activation magnetization adsorption heavy metal water treatment 1 introduction owing to the rapid boom in industrialization the proper treatment of the heavy metals from industrial wastewater has become of monumental importance 1 heavy metals are readily soluble in aquatic environs and once these connect up to food or drinking water chain considerable concentrations can accumulate inside the human body which can be lethal if allowed to go beyond tolerable limits 2 3 nickel and lead which are used in manufacturing processes of batteries super alloys and smelting of sulfide ores are considered to be severely toxic even at low concentrations in addition to such common metal ions efficient removal of toxic nuclear waste related metal ions is another important application of adsorbents from the environmental standpoint biosorbents and activated carbons are good adsorbents for these metal ions but compared to biochar bc are relatively expensive biochar the solid byproduct of biomass pyrolysis with a microporous carbonaceous structure has been increasingly recognized as an efficient adsorbent for a vast number of pollutants surface area porosity and functionality of biochar govern the sorption capacity and the sorption mechanisms involved generally pore size and the surface area tends to increase with pyrolysis temperature the dehydration process due to water loss during pyrolysis generates pores of different sizes of nano 0 9 nm micro 2 nm and macro 50 nm regardless of their charges or polarity biochar with relatively small pore size is inefficient in trapping large sorbates 4 in general the micro and mesopores are more important in the removal of metal ions 5 in addition the application performance of biochar is closely related to the quantity and types of functional groups the three n functional groups pyrrolic n pyridinic n and graphitic n are related to catalysis of oxygen reduction while amine n influenced the adsorption of metal ions and co2 therefore better performance is corresponding to the abundance of active n functional groups and the increase in the nitrogen content of biochar 6 surface amination is among the most common methods to introduce amino groups into biochar the addition of basic amino groups to the surface is a promising method for increasing the efficiency of biochar in adsorption of carbon dioxide and metal ions to reach this objective three different methods can be applied surface amination through i nitration by ammonia ii nitration by amino containing reagents iii combination of nitration and reduction 7 a hindrance to these ongoing advancements in metal ion adsorption has been biochar recovery after wastewater treatment time consuming steps like centrifugation and filtration are unlikely to be efficient in large scale applications the magnetization of biochar has provided a novel approach allowing practical use of small particle size adsorbents which have high surface areas and fast adsorption kinetics high performance magnetically separable adsorbent is also a readily applicable technology which would reduce the harmful impacts of nuclear waste related metal ions and radioactive material on human health and the environment e g fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster after a 9 0 magnitude earthquake on march 2011 in which large amounts of water were contaminated with radioactive isotopes with the use of a magnet magnetic biochar can be easily and quickly separated after adsorbing heavy metal contaminants from water this makes either batch or stirred processes a viable option while also overcoming the drawbacks caused by filtration of small particle size adsorbents and delivering faster adsorption kinetics 8 magnetic biochar can also effectively be used in the removal of inorganic anions antibiotics pesticides organic dyes nuclear materials and other organic pollutants from aqueous solution or wastewaters 9 10 impregnation co precipitation and liquid reduction are the most common methods that have been used to prepare magnetic biochar impregnation includes mixing the biomass with a ferric or ferrous chloride precursor solution and subsequent pyrolysis of the obtained biomass in an inert environment under high temperature this single step pyrolysis of fecl3 loaded biomass can produce biochar with magnetic properties but simultaneously produces secondary pollution is costly and may not address any desired functional group on biochar surface 11 liu et al 12 developed a fe3o4 loaded magnetic biochar with a spinel structure magnetite fe3o4 or maghemite γ fe2o3 using a mixture of fecl3 and biomass in a pyrolysis process under the flow of nitrogen n2 gas at 600 c for almost 3 h the composite exhibiting a large surface area of 349 m2 g and was effective for as v adsorption a similar method has been used by other researchers to produce well crystallined magnetic biochar 13 14 however surface functional groups which support adsorption through complexation become limited via this process as they react with iron in various oxidation reactions during pyrolysis reducing biochar s heavy metal adsorption capacity significantly 15 16 the magnetization of biochar has typically been achieved through the traditional method of chemical co precipitation with magnetite fe3o4 15 17 in this process iron oxides of magnetic nature are precipitated directly onto the biochar with the use of biocarbon and a mixed fe2 fe3 salt solution these iron compounds have been used individually or in unison to impart magnetism on the biochar 18 19 the liquid phase reduction method comprises mixing the biocarbon with fe2 salt solution and then reducing fe2 to zero valent iron on the biochar surface using a reducing agent nabh4 kbh4 philippou et al 20 investigated the fabrication of magnetic biochar pncm and fe3o4 loaded oxidized biochar pncom using pine needles as a precursor in a co precipitation process the results showed better adsorptive properties for pncom particularly in the acidic ph range however the co precipitation and liquid phase reduction can reduce the porosity of biochar due to the aggregation of iron oxides in the aqueous solution this results in a decrease in the surface area and hence the adsorption capability of biochar 21 even with the optimum amount of doping the decrease in heavy metal adsorption is prevalent to reap the benefits of magnetic separation overcoming these drawbacks is crucial 22 recently more complicated magnetic biochar structures have been synthesized using electrostatic attraction cui et al 23 developed a core shell γ al2o3 fe3o4 biochar afbc through electrostatic attraction and inner sphere complexation afbc represented a high phosphorus recovery and excellent stability nanoscale colloidal iron oxide fe3o4 nanoparticles nps that exhibit superparamagnetic properties at ambient temperatures can deliver magnetic property to the carbonaceous structures however bare fe3o4 nanoparticles are easily aggregated and reduce the porosity if they are directly precipitated on carbon structure 24 the fe3o4 nps may also be detached once the adsorbent comes in contact with water in order to overcome these drawbacks a homogenous loading and immobilization of magnetic nanoparticles on into carbon structure has been regarded as an efficient method to increase the stability of nps yet delivering the magnetic property while the original porosity of the structure is also maintained to reach these objectives physical activation of carbon structure using ultrasound waves and simultaneous immobilization functionalization is proposed in this research work this study proposes a novel magnetization process to synthesize a double layer functionalized magnetic biochar composite tes fe3o4 biochar through a three step process i physical activation of biochar under ultrasound irradiation us bc ii magnetization of sono activated biochar with fe3o4 nanoparticles usmbc and iii functionalization of usmbc with 3 triethoxysilyl propylamine tes activating biochar bc with ultrasound us irradiation which include disarrangement and exfoliation of bc s graphitic structure mineral leaching and a significant increase in bc s porosity significant increase in bc s internal surface area creation of new and opening of blocked mesopores and enhanced carbon and hydrogen content of biochar 25 all these phenomena provide more room for magnetic nanoparticles functional groups and subsequently adsorption capacity tes improve the stability of fe3o4 nanoparticles fe np on the biochar surface and increase adsorption sites functional groups for heavy metals the process suggested not only facilitates biochar removal after heavy metal adsorption but also increases its adsorption capacity this study investigates the synergisms of ultrasound activation fe3o4 loading and tes functionalization with respect to adsorption rates of nickel and lead 2 materials and methods

and formation of non magnetic oxides through oxidation of fe2 to fe3 giving higher yield of magnetite particles the black precipitate was collected by filtration washed with 100 ml distilled water

eventually the functionalized magnetized biochar composite was filtered washed with distilled water several times until ph was close to 7 and dried at 60 c for 12 h 2 2 2 characterizations of the adsorbent the porosities and surface areas of the raw ultra sonicated and magnetized biochars were measured using a surface area analyzer 3flex microactivetm share multiport surface characterization analyzer 350 00 001 00edu prior to analysis the samples were degassed at 373 k for 3 h the analysis was done with a liquid nitrogen bath at 77 k and the technique measures volume adsorbed by the sample as the relative pressure is gradually increased from 0 to 1 then the mesopore area and pore volume were calculated by the bet brunauer emmett and teller equation the t plot based on the de boer equation was also used to calculate micropore surface area and pore volume 31 the morphological analysis was conducted using sem jsm 5600 scanning electron microscope jeol usa inc peabody ms at an accelerating voltage of 5 7 kv using a jsm 5600 sem jeol ltd tokyo japan the samples were mounted on aluminum stubs using glued carbon tapes and then coated with platinum for 3 min at about 120 mtorr

h o was investigated through combustion analysis by huffman hazen laboratory colorado usa fourier raman labram hr evolution usa fourier transform infrared ftir cary 660 ftir agilent usa spectroscopies were also employed to characterize the graphitic structure of samples and surface functional groups the doping of iron oxides on the biochar surface and the presence of tes raman spectra were acquired in the air at room temperature using a 532 nm wavelength laser the laser was focused onto the sample using a 100x objective for ftir analysis samples were dried at 333 k under vacuum prior to analysis a background scan was conducted before each sample is scanned samples were put in atr crystal and scanned in the wavelength range of 400 4000 cm 1 2 2 3 nickel and lead adsorption studies distinct solutions containing 100 mg l ni2 and pb2 were prepared using powdered nickel ii chloride 98 sigma aldrich and powdered lead ii chloride 98 sigma aldrich respectively in each adsorption experiment 0 5 g of the synthesized biochar composite was added to a 50 ml solution of 100 mg l ni2 or pb2 and was stirred in a shaker for varying durations 30 min 1 2 4 and 6 h after which the biochar was separated from the solution first using strong neodymium magnets fig 2 a and further by filtration the metal ion concentration of the filtrate was determined through uv vis spectroscopy dr6000 hach using the respective standard kits tnt856 for nickel using dimethylglyoxime method and tnt850 for lead using par method for the former nickel ions react with dimethylglyoxime in an alkaline solution to form an orange brown complex the measurement wavelength is 463 nm in the latter lead ii ions react at ph 9 with 4 2 pyridylazo resorcinol par to form a red complex the measurement wavelength is 520 nm metal concentrations were greater than the measuring range therefore the samples were first diluted with distilled water to prevent precipitation in the vial 2 2 4 kinetic studies the equilibrium adsorption capacities for ni ii and pb ii were calculated according to q e c 0 c e v m where c0 ce v and m are the initial and the residual concentration of metal ions in the solution mg l 1 the volume of heavy metal solution ml and the amount of adsorbents mg respectively in addition both the pseudo first order ln q e q t l n q e k 1 t and pseudo second order t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t equations were used to model the adsorption kinetics where qt and qe mg g are the amount of metal ion adsorbed per gram of adsorbent at time t and at equilibrium respectively k1 min 1 and k2 g mg min are the rate constants for the pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption models respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 mechanism of chemical activation of biochar np with tes the co precipitation process has

4 4 h 2 o though loading the magnetic fe3o4 on the surface fig 3 def delivers magnetization properties to the biochar matrix some magnetic nanoparticles may be detached when the biochar comes in contact with aqueous solutions the main objectives of tes addition include stabilizing the fe3o4 nanoparticles fe np preventing the dissociation of fe nps from the biochar thereby improving the reusability of the adsorbent and increasing the quantity of nitrogen containing functional groups for enhanced adsorption of metal ions fig 2b tes can be attached to the porous structure of biochar either through impregnation using weak van der waals forces 32 or grafting using strong covalent bonds to the biochar s functional groups theoretically surface functionalization with tes should afford a homogeneous coupling as surface oh groups replace the ethoxy groups on tes fig 2b 29 30 however hydrogen bonding between surface oh and silanols amino groups may also happen fig 1 30 the amine functional groups of tes can increase the adsorption capacity due to complexation with heavy metals 7 33 cu ii ni ii and pb ii strongly bind to amine groups weaker binding has been observed between amine containing sites and cd ii or zn ii however they still prefer amine sites to pure carboxylates no preference has been observed for ca ii binding with amine compared to carboxylate ligand groups indicating ca ii is bound by more negatively charged molecules 34 amine groups also effectively participate in the adsorption of cr vi amination with 3 aminopropyltrimethoxysilane aptms which is analogous to tes increases the cr vi uptake of mesoporous silica from 36 95 mg g to 83 50 mg g 35 bamdad et al 29 applied two different chemical methods for amine functionalization of biochar including i nitration using concentrated nitric acid followed by reduction and ii condensation of tes on the surface though the authors concluded that a moderate thermal activation is needed after amination tes aminated biochar indicated a higher co2 adsorption capacity compared to nitration reduction 3 2 physical activation of biochar table 1 shows the surface area and total pore volumes of raw ultrasound activated and magnetized functionalized biochars using different loadings of fe np and tes concentrations the specific surface area of bcs was calculated using the brunauer emmett teller bet and harkins and jura equations the impact of ultrasound activation on increasing the micro porosity and surface area of bc has recently been proved as an effective method for the physical activation of biochar this effect is mainly attributed to ultrasound induced cavitation and its implications in addition the explosion of cavitation bubbles and generation of micro jets can create a regular pattern of new pores into onto the biochar surface which is visible in sem images fig 3b vs a as a result the bet surface area of raw biochar increased from 219 98 261 67 m2 g after only 30 s of bc exposure to ultrasound irradiation on the other hand the mesopore surface area reduced from 96 54 68 45 m2 g due to the partial conversion of mesopores to micropores in other words many macropores are broken down into micropores enhancing the overall surface with more porosities as expected the loading of nanoparticles and tes functionalization reduced micro and mesoporosity of biochar and lowered its surface area by 13 which may cause a reduction in the adsorption capacity yet exposure to 60 s of ultrasound activation could sustain much of the bet surface area when bc was magnetized and functionalized with a loss of only 2 compared with raw bc further porosity reduction was observed by increasing the concentration of tes or maximizing the loading of nanoparticles accordingly the minimum bet surface areas of 182 15 and 181 65 m2 g were observed for the samples containing either the maximum loading of fe np us30 bc fe 1 1 tes5 or tes us30 bc fe 2 1 tes15 the sem images also demonstrate the increased partial coating of biochar surface with tes and a uniform distribution of fe np on bc surface fig 3d f edx analysis of the biochar surface fig 3g h shows the elemental percentage composition of c o fe and si on the surfaces of magnetized and magnetized functionalized biochar before tes treatment fe from the nanoparticles is detected after tes the si that coats the nanoparticles is detected instead 3 2 1 effect of physicochemical magnetization on elemental composition of biochar table 2 lists the elemental c h n s o and fe and ash contents of raw and double layer magnetized functionalized biochar composites as observed the ultrasound activation of biochar increases the c content of biochar which is consistent with our previous works ultrasound cavitation and its implications e g micro jets hot spots shock waves etc can exfoliate the graphitic structure of biochar and facilitate the leaching of mineral compounds ash content which subsequently increases the portion of organic compounds in the biochar structure in addition the results show that ultrasound activation slightly reduced the oxygen content of biochar presumably through the removal of some of the oxygen containing functional groups 25 26 upon magnetization and loading of fe3o4 nanoparticles the fe and o contents of the samples increased as expected ultrasound activation also affects the loading of fe3o4 nanoparticles as observed unsonicated us0 bc fe 2 1 tes 5 contained the least fe 3 8 content of the magnetized samples however ultrasonication increased the fe content to 7 93 and 6 56 for us30 bc fe 2 1 tes5 and us60 bc fe2 1 tes5 respectively compared to the sonicated magnetized bc samples us0 bc fe 2 1 tes5 compensated for its low fe with a higher quantity of c h and n the higher porosity and surface area of the sonicated samples allows the subsequent incorporation of a higher quantity of fe np into the biochar structure which lowers the of other elements as expected increasing the ratio of bc to magnetic nanoparticles reduced their loading and hence o declined however fe content showed an increase which is against our expectations it should be explained that different combustion analyzers and therefore different samples are used for the analysis of c h n s o and fe this paradox between the o and fe trends could be due to the agglomeration of nanoparticles in some samples 24 to probe such paradoxes we synthesized three sets of samples and analyzed the elements three times the last section of the table focuses on the effect of tes concentration during the process of functionalization as observed n and ash contents significantly increased with tes concentration from 5 to 15 ml l the maximum n content was observed for us 30 bc fe 2 1 tes15 3 2 2 effect of physiochemical magnetization on functional groups of biochar the effects of magnetization and tes functionalization on functional groups of double layer biochar composites under different conditions as indicated by their ftir spectra are provided in fig 4 data were analyzed by origin software figs 1 3 supplementary the wide band at 3300 3600 cm 1 represents the stretching vibration of the hydrogen bonded hydroxyl group 36 the intensification of this bond was significantly reduced due to ultrasound activation most likely due to the loss of oh and cooh functional groups this is consistent with our elemental analysis which confirms the reduction of o and h containing groups and our previous studies according to the literature the most prominent features of tes are located between 740 1250 cm 1 37 39 accordingly the characteristic peak at 765 795 cm 1 corresponds to the si c vibration 39 40 or sio c 41 suggesting that the organic alkyl chains are covalently bonded to the si o si networks 40 42 the other two peaks at 952 cm 1 and 1110 cm 1 were assigned to the si o c bond 39 41 and si o si stretching 40 43 41 respectively herein referred to as the si o x region these two peaks can confirm the coating of the magnetite surface through the silanization reaction with hydrolysis of et o si bonds to make horizontal si o si links between tes groups fig 2b the silica network is adsorbed on the surface by si o c bonds fig 1 41 44 the peak at 1100 cm 1 is associated with either the stretching vibration of co bonds in the bc structure cn of the incorporated c nh2 bond 39 or si o c or si o si bonds 45 the observed si corresponding bands prove that tes was successfully grafted onto the magnetized biochar the other new peak exhibited at 1580 1620 cm 1 was assigned to the nh bending of the nh2 amine group 45 41 the peak around 2100 cm 1 is likely an overtone of the 1050 region and the peak at 2300 cm 1 is co2 there could be some overlap between the peaks as an instance a peak that is observed 1047 cm 1 could also be associated with si o fe stretching vibrations 42 in addition the two peaks valued at 1635 and 575 cm 1 are assigned to symmetrical and anti symmetrical fe o vibrations 42 46 47 and a small peak next to it at around 665 cm 1 can result from the feooh stretching vibration which usually appears in activated carbon modified by fe3 48 49 it may also have some overlap with o si o asymmetric flexing 50 the presence of these two strong bonds in all magnetized samples suggests the attachment of magnetic nanoparticles to the biochar upon magnetization and functionalization the intensity of fe o 575 cm 1 and si o x 700 1200 peaks cm 1 significantly increased among the first group of peaks which reflects the effect of structural modification using ultrasound irradiation the highest intensities of these peaks were observed for the highest duration of ultrasound activation the ftir spectra of magnetization using different loadings of fe3o4 nanoparticles are represented in maroon color in fig 4 as expected the highest fe o peak at 575 cm 1 was observed for us30 bc fe 1 1 tes since an equal quantity of biochar and fe nanoparticles were used in the activation process the intensity of this peak gradually decreased with the reduction of fe np loading another important observation is that not only fe o peak but also the si o x peaks were significantly higher in us30 bc fe 1 1 tes5 which can be due to the increased attachment of tes into this sample however it does not necessarily improve the adsorption capacity of biochar as this capability is a resultant of a combination of phenomena including physical adoption surface complexation inner sphere complexation etc higher fe and tes loading reduces the surface area and porosity of biochar which may negatively affect its adsorption capacity the lines highlighted in the blue color of fig 4 demonstrate the effect of different tes concentrations in the amination step the intensity of ftir peaks of si o x and fe o increased with tes concentration up to 10 ml however no further increase in the intensity of peaks was observed for the higher tes dose of 15 ml which is consistent with the trend of fe and n contents in the samples 3 2 3 effect of physiochemical magnetization on graphitic structure of biochar fig 5 a shows the raman spectra of the biochars activated and functionalized under different ultrasound irradiation and tes loading the spectra were recorded with a linear laser excitation of 532 nm and the baselines were revised in general their spectra share common features at around 1000 1529 1500 1775 and 2800 cm 1 the so called d g and 2d peaks respectively the d band or disorder induced peak is attributed to in plane vibrations of sp2 bonded carbon within structural defects amorphous or disordered graphite the d band has a low intensity in well organized carbonaceous materials and graphite however it becomes similar in intensity to the g band for more disordered carbons such as biochar the g band stretching carbon carbon sp2 bonds arises from the in plane vibrations of the sp2 bonded carbon in graphitic crystallites the intensity ratio between the d and g band id ig is a measure of defects in graphite based materials the comparable intensity of d band and g band with an intensity ratio ranging from 0 46 to 0 72 indicates that biochar is made of a high quantity of ordered and disordered graphitic carbons the 2d band also known as g band is the second order overtone of the d band and is the result of a two phonon lattice vibrational process but unlike the d band it does not need to be activated by proximity to a defect the 2d band is usually used to determine graphene layer thickness it is much sharper and more intense in the single layer graphene than in multi layer graphene according to the raman results and as expected the biochar structure involves mainly multi layer graphene graphitic structure it has been reported that the intensity of the g band increases with the number of graphene layers for thin samples up to 7 layers and then decreases with the further increase of the number of layers 23 40 layers and graphite fig 5b 51 raw chars usually contain clusters of 4 6 parallel graphene and graphitic oxide sheets 52 53 therefore reduced intensity of g peak can also be related to the exfoliation and reduction of biochar layers due to ultrasound activation in addition a lower intensity of d and g bands in ultrasound activated sample us30 can indicate that the size of the crystallites decreases this is consistent with our observation confirming the reduced biochar s particle size upon ultrasound activation the intensity of d and g peaks decreased upon magnetization and functionalization without ultrasonication this indicates an increasing roughness and thickness of crystals due to the partial coating of the surface however the intensity of the id ig ratio increased with ultrasound activation duration from 0 56 for us0 bs fe 2 1 tes5 to 0 72 for us60 bs fe 2 1 tes5 and was greatest with the lowest tes dosage of 5 ml 3 3 heavy metal adsorption studies 3 3 1 ultrasound activation effect fig 6 presents the performances of raw and the double layer magnetized functionalized biochar composite in adsorption of nickel and lead ions all adsorption tests were conducted two times as observed raw biochar can remove only 14 of nickel and 67 of lead ions generally the removal of pb2 ions in aqueous solution is easier than ni2 ions 54 the ionic radius electronegativity covalent bond strength and the hydration properties of the metal ions are the principal properties used in the interpretation of heavy metal adsorption mechanisms 55 structures with a smaller hydrated radius and higher electronegativity have more potential for surface complexation or adsorption reactions 55 the degree of hydration of metal ions depends on the ratio of charge electrostatic charge to volume a lower number of water molecules hydrate the larger ions that have smaller charges per volume pb ii ions have a larger ionic radius than ni ii ions 0 119 vs 0 069 nm however the hydrated radius of pb ii ions is smaller than that of ni ii ions 0 401 nm vs 0 404 nm 56 the ion with the smaller hydrated radius should be adsorbed more strongly on the other hand stronger covalent bonds should be formed with more electronegative metals lead 2 33 is more electronegative than nickel 1 91 the combination of higher electronegativity and a smaller hydration radius ensures a higher covalent bond between the lead ion and the electron donor of the adsorbent surface compared to nickel 54 57 short term physical activation of biochar with ultrasound irradiation increased the nickel removal to 25 and lead removal to 78 this improvement was caused by the ultrasound cavitation and its implications which subsequently increased the surface area and porosity of bc additionally micro jets can generate new pores and open some of the blocked pores which not only increases the porosity of biochar but also makes channels to the underlayers of biochar where some functional groups are secluded these effects also favor the magnetization and functionalization steps magnetization usually decreases the adsorption capacity of biochar however comparing the adsorption results of us0 bc fe 2 1 tes5 to raw bc demonstrates the contribution of amine functionalization following magnetization which not only prevented overall reduction of metal removal but even slightly increased the adsorption capacity of biochar ultrasound activation of biochar prior to magnetization and functionalization further increased the metal removal given the fact that the maximum nickel and lead removal without ultrasound was 17 and 79 for us0 bc fe 2 1 tes5 a significant increase of ni and pb adsorption to 32 and 90 respectively for us60 bc fe 2 1 tes5 is attributed to the structural modification accompanying ultrasound irradiation 3 3 2 magnetization effect the magnetization process was conducted using three different bc fe ratios of 1 1 2 1 and 3 1 for nickel the lowest the nanoparticle loading corresponded to the greatest the adsorption capacity the reduction of biochar s adsorption capacity with nanoparticle loading is mainly due to the nanoparticles reducing the surface area and the porosity of biochar therefore among the three fe3o4 loadings with 30 s of ultrasound pre activation the maximum ni ii adsorption of 28 was observed for us30 bc fe 3 1 tes5 which contained the lowest quantity of fe3o4 nanoparticles the value further increased to 32 for longer ultrasonication us60 bc fe 3 1 tes5 moreover longer ultrasound activation significantly reduced the adsorption time increased the adsorption rate in other words fig s2 the highest amount of nickel was removed by us60 bc fe 3 1 tes5 within only 2 h in terms of lead removal the highest absorption was observed for us30 bc fe 2 1 tes5 rather than for us30 bc fe 3 1 tes5 however in this case the sample containing the highest fe np loading us30 bc fe 1 1 tes5 displayed the least adsorption 3 3 3 functionalization effect among samples with us30 and 2 1 bce fe loading the highest adsorption of both ni ii and pb ii was observed for the sample containing the lowest tes loading us30 bc fe2 1 tes5 further increasing the tes concentration reduced the adsorption capacity of the activated biochars this can be due to the significant impact of chemical functionalization in reducing the surface area and porosity of adsorbent particularly in terms of ni ii adsorption however the contradictory impact of tes in increasing the removal of pb ii can be noticed by comparing the results of us30 78 and us30 bc fe 2 1 tes5 89 it is worth noting to mention that this project was initially conducted by direct precipitation of fe3o4 on the usbc surface without any functionalization not covered in the manuscript which caused a significant reduction in the adsorption capacity of biochar this could be mainly due to the reduction in surface area and porosity of biochar however it also suggested that fe3o4 did not make a significant contribution to the adsorption process therefore the increase in adsorption capacity of tes functionalized magnetic usbc suggests a determinant role of chemisorption by the amino groups of tes in pb removal such a prominent capability of tes in removal of lead and other heavy metals has also been reported by other researchers 58 for example kong et al 59 functionalized the surface of silica nanoparticles by three silane coupling agents including 3 mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane mptes and tes and compared their performances on the removal of pb ii cu ii hg ii cd ii and zn ii tes functionalized silica nanoparticles sio2 tes exhibited maximum removal efficiency towards pb2 and hg2 shi et al 60 also synthesized magnetic biochar in three steps including preparation of carboxylated biochar synthesis of fe3o4 sio2 nh2 particles from fe3o4 particles modified with teos and tes via the stober method and then conjugation of the fe3o4 sio2 nh2 with the carboxylated biochar by forming amide bonds via the classic edc nhs coupling the cr vi ion adsorption capacity of their magnetic biochar was 27 2 mg g 1 surpassing the original carboxylated biochar 18 2 mg g 1 compared to their work the method developed in this study is much simpler in addition the focus of the current work is promoting the adsorption and functionalization capability of biochar rather than using it as a carrier or support and the final difference of this study over the other similar works is that ph as a master variable in adsorption of heavy metals was not adjusted in this study and the adsorption was conducted on the inherent ph of the solution 3 4 kinetic and the equilibrium adsorption based on the analysis presented in figs s2 s3 and tables s1 s2 supplementary information the pseudo second order model was generally more suitable for explaining the behavior of pb ii adsorption into magnetized biochar indicating that the reaction is more inclined towards chemisorption due to the impact of functional groups on biochar surface rather than physisorption the pseudo second order plots were also superior for ni ii adsorption however the pseudo first order plots also showed reasonable r values 0 9 for 2 3 of the sonicated ni samples suggesting an impact for both physisorption and chemisorption in ni removal however most of the metal removal was accomplished during the early stage of adsorption 30 min out of 6 h the difference between the calculated and experimental values of adsorption capacities shows that a more number of data points is needed from during the early stages of adsorption 4 conclusion this study introduced a post pyrolysis ultrasound based magnetization process to produce the double layer magnetic tes functionalized biochar according to ftir analysis the most prominent features of tes are located between 740 1250 cm 1 si c vibration si o c peak and si o si stretching which can confirm the coating of the magnetite surface through the silanization reaction and the formation of silica network on the bc surface by si o c bonds the adsorption results demonstrated that while raw biochar could remove only 13 and 68 of ni ii and pb ii with some signs of leaching the biochar activated under 60 s of ultrasound irradiation magnetized with fe3o4 in the ratio of 2 1 and functionalized with the lowest concentration of tes exhibited 32 and 90 of ni and pb removal without any leaching the highest adsorption capacity was associated with the maximum ultrasound activation of 60 s which suggests the impact of porosity and surface area on the subsequent functionalization and the removal of metal ions although the low concentration of tes increased the adsorption capacity high tes concentrations adversely affected the adsorption capacity due to the reduction of surface area and porosity kinetic studies suggest that pb ii adsorption is more inclined towards chemisorption while both physisorption and chemisorption contribute to ni removal the bulk of the biochar could be separated from water by application of a neodymium magnet even at the lowest fe np loading of bc fe 3 1

13694,oil in water emulsions created in shipboard bilgewater can be challenging to treat to hydrocarbon limiting environmental discharge regulations while emulsion behavior has been widely studied in other disciplines research on bilgewater emulsions has been limited due to the variability of bilgewater composition in this context surfactant types and concentrations are generally unknown therefore experimental properties of neat surfactants and commercial cleaners were evaluated for predicting bilgewater emulsion stability critical micelle concentration cmc cmc in the presence of oil cmcift and equilibrium interfacial tension ift were investigated for emulsion stability using different surfactant types oil concentrations and homogenization energies it was found that cmc was significantly larger in the presence of mineral oil γ values of all three surfactants were similar for the oil water and air water cases however the κ values were larger for the oil water interface suggesting that for a given surfactant the adsorption of the surfactant molecules to the oil water interface was more active than to the air water interface it was also determined that emulsion stability was most closely related to cmcift coalescence into a separated oil layer was only observed in emulsion samples with surfactant concentrations below cmcift this relationship was observed for different homogenization intensities and oil concentrations experiments also validated the relationship between cmcift and oil separation in more complex formulations of commercial cleaners commonly found aboard ships four different cleaners with unique compositions all demonstrated separated oil at concentrations below cmcift overall cmcift represents a practical way to evaluate a cleaner s likelihood of developing stable 72 h with no observable oil separation emulsions in bilgewater keywords bilgewater critical micelle concentration cleaners emulsion interfacial tension 1 introduction bilgewater is a regulated shipboard wastewater composed of seawater oils solvents surfactants and particulate matter that accumulates in the lowest parts of a ship 1 2 oil pollution abatement opa systems are employed for the purpose of managing shipboard bilgewater or oily wastewater to comply with environmental regulations 3 free oils can be readily separated from the water phase by simple physical processes like gravity separation however oil in water emulsions formed in bilgewater i e chemical emulsions are notoriously difficult to break 4 5 therefore it is critical to develop innovative methods for separating oil from water to ensure proper on board bilgewater treatment a fundamental understanding of emulsion stabilization in bilgewater could enable targeted emulsion management strategies the stability of oil in water emulsions are widely studied in food science cosmetics agro chemicals paints and pharmaceuticals 6 8 in these disciplines of research surfactants can be carefully selected to stabilize emulsions based on the dispersed or continuous phases in addition to their robustness to environmental conditions 8 from these studies it has been found that emulsion stability depends strongly on the droplet size type and concentration of surfactant used the viscosity of the continuous phase and other environmental conditions 9 in fact in cases where emulsions are designed to remain stable for long periods of time e g on the order of years tight control of these parameters is necessary to prevent emulsion destabilization mechanisms such as flocculation creaming ostwald ripening and coalescence 10 11 in the context of oily wastewater treatment such as bilgewater surfactant types and concentrations are generally unknown or highly variable 3 12 therefore it is difficult to predict stability of oily wastewater emulsions on a fundamental level for bilgewater applications it is desirable to relate experimentally obtained properties of common shipboard cleaners to emulsion stability components of commercial cleaners are often proprietary therefore it is important to have an empirical method for determining the stabilization imparted by commercial cleaners ideally specific experimentally derived properties of the cleaners or surfactants could be used to predict their behavior in bilgewater systems two experimentally determined properties of surfactants that have been associated with droplet stability in traditional systems are critical micelle concentration cmc and interfacial tension ift cmc is the concentration of surfactant above which micellization becomes thermodynamically favorable and any additional surfactant added to the system forms micelles cmc can be determined experimentally using several methods including surface tension ift dye micellization or conductivity 13 for each method the cmc is defined as the surfactant concentration above which the measured parameter becomes independent of surfactant concentration while some research has indicated a significant change in emulsion stability when an emulsifier concentration is above the cmc 14 15 other studies have found that cmc is not an important parameter for emulsion stability 16 17 one explanation for this discrepancy is that cmc is almost exclusively reported based on measurements in the aqueous phase i e surface tension measurements however some studies have shown cmc can change in the presence of an oil phase when a surfactant is solubilized by the second phase 13 18 considering oil is a major component of emulsions cmc should also be calculated using the ift measurements between an aqueous and representative oil phase cmcift ift is the measurement of the work as mn m required to increase the size of the interface between two immiscible liquids and plays an important role in the formation of emulsion droplets during emulsification 19 in fact theoretical analysis and experimental results have shown that droplet diameter depends on the power density of energy dissipation and the oil water ift 20 21 many model equations have been developed to relate ift and emulsification energy to droplet size and emulsion stability 22 24 while there are multiple examples of research relating cmc and ift to emulsion stability 15 17 22 these studies were performed under carefully controlled environments in particular it is unclear whether the cmc cmcift or ift of a shipboard cleaner i e a mixture of surfactants and other compounds can be used to predict emulsion stability the role of cmc cmcift or ift in predicting emulsion stability is likely to differ with emulsification energy and or oil concentration in addition defining emulsion stability by creaming rate rather than oil separation will also influence the impact of cmc or ift on stability this is because creaming rate measures how effectively oil droplets are able to stay suspended in the bulk layer and is ultimately governed by differences in phase densities and droplet size distribution however oil separation requires coalescence a mechanism that is dependent on many factors including surfactant concentration type and adsorption in the context of bilgewater it is important to break the emulsions into a completely separate oil layer to reduce the volume of stored waste oil and to avoid fouling equipment with cream the current study looks at the relationship between cmc cmcift and ift on emulsion formation and stability using different surfactant types oil concentrations and homogenization energies to determine the usefulness of experimentally determined cleaner properties for predicting emulsion stability in bilgewater emulsions were prepared with representative non ionic surfactants triton x 100 and triton cg 110 and a representative anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds to understand how emulsions behave using pure surfactants then to explore the applicability of using cmc cmcift and ift to explain emulsion

solvents were used as received unless otherwise noted 2 2 characterization of surfactant properties 2 2 1 interfacial and surface tension measurements ift of the surfactant solutions were measured using a du noüy ring tensiometer sigma 701 attension measurements were conducted for each surfactant at 9 different concentrations ranging from 10 ppm to 10 000 ppm 40 ml of mineral oil was carefully added to 80 ml of a surfactant solution to create a clean interface without any bubbles a platinum ring was lowered into the oil portion of the sample and the tensiometer was blanked next the interface was left undisturbed for at least 5 min to allow for surfactant adsorption at the interface to reach equilibrium the tensiometer then automatically determined the location of the oil water interface by lowing the ring through the sample until a change in force of 0 03 mn m was detected next the tensiometer measured the force required to pull the ring back through the oil water interface and recorded the ift in mn m since the ring disturbed the oil water interface during the measurement new samples were prepared for each replicate the du noüy ring was cleaned with isopropanol and dried between each measurement measurements were performed in duplicate surface tension was measured using the same method as ift except that the measurement was made between the air water interface rather than an oil water interface surface tension measurements were performed continuously until the surface tension reached equilibrium generally within 5 min equilibrium was defined as 10 consecutive surface tension measurements with less than a 0 5 mn m deviation experiments were conducted at room temperature 20 22 c after finding that cmc was significantly different in the presence of mineral oil ift measurements were repeated using pendant drop method to monitor ift over time and ensure that equilibrium was reached a goniometer model 210 ramehart was used for the pendant drop analysis since mineral oil is less dense than water a j hook needle was used to suspend the mineral oil droplet in the surfactant solutions ift was measured every 30 secs for 1 5 hrs in general equilibrium was reached within 60 min fig s1 despite the longer time needed to reach equilibrium the equilibrium ift values were generally within 10 of the values obtained using the du nouy ring method fig s2 2 2 2 critical micelle concentration cmc while cmc values of surfactants are typically reported based on surface tension measurements it is assumed that in the case of bilgewater emulsions cmc measurements based on ift measurements will be more representative due to differences in surfactant packing at an oil water interface thus in this work cmc was determined using both surface tension and ift measurements 25 the cmc derived from ift measurements will be noted as cmcift to calculate cmc and cmcift the equilibrium surface tension or ift of a series of surfactant solutions were plotted against the surfactant concentration on a semi log plot the data was then fit with two linear regressions one regression was used to fit the data below cmc a regime where the ift or surface tension are dependent on surfactant concentration the second regression was fit to the data above cmc where the ift or surface tension are independent of surfactant concentration the cmc and cmcift were then calculated by determining the intersection between the concentration dependent and independent regions using origin 2018b 2 3 preparation of emulsions emulsion samples were prepared with mineral oil light deionized di water and a single surfactant or cleaner mineral oil was used due to its viscosity and density being similar to that of collected bilge oil mineral oil is also present in common shipboard lubricating oils i e lube oil 2190 many bilgewater treatment studies reporting the use of standard bilge mixes were composed of diesel fuel and lubricating oils 3 however aromatic compounds and fuel additives found in these mixtures make it difficult directly relate emulsion stability to properties of cleaners 26 all samples were prepared with the same 10 surfactant concentrations 0 10 50 100 500 1 000 2 000 4 000 8 000 and 10 000 ppm in order to observe emulsion stability above and below cmc for each surfactant emulsions were generated with either 10 or 20 v v mineral oil to generate the oil fraction of interest an appropriate volume of mineral oil was added to the surfactant solutions such that the total volume was 20 ml samples were then emulsified using either a high or low intensity homogenization to understand the impacts of cmc cmcift and ift under different homogenization regimes high intensity homogenization samples were homogenized using a high shear homogenizer omni tissue master model 125 10 mm generator probe at 20 000 rpm for 2 min in a 50 ml centrifuge tube fisher sci 14 959 49a and poured into a 50 ml glass flat bottom vials with teflon lined screw caps qorpak glc01020 low intensity homogenization samples were placed in glass sample vials capped and then inverted 10 times bulk emulsion stability experiments were performed at room temperature 20 22 c 2 4 characterization of bulk emulsion stability 2 4 1 bulk emulsion stability immediately after emulsion preparation samples were placed on a shelf where energy input from vibrations and changes in temperature 20 22 c were limited photos of the samples were taken using a digital camera nikon d80 every 30 min for the first 4 h then every 24 h up to 72 h changes in the appearance of the emulsion cream and oil layers were recorded and used to qualitatively indicate emulsion stability a full experimental flight emulsions at all 10 concentrations was performed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility in addition triplicate samples of each model surfactant and cleaner were prepared at cmc and 7 cmc photographs of macro phase separation from these samples showed the results to be highly reproducible supplementary information si fig s3 table s1 2 4 2 macro phase oil separation during the bulk emulsion stability experiments the creaming layer obscured the view of the separated oil phase fig s4 therefore a separation technique was employed to quantify the oil separation after the emulsion samples reached equilibrium 72 h samples were poured into a 100 ml separatory funnel and settled for 5 min to allow the sample to separate into its emulsion cream and oil layers a pre weighed vial was then used to collect the separated oil layer and weighed to determine the amount of oil separation for each sample the oil separation termed macro phase oil separation was presented as a percentage of the total oil used in the emulsion generation 2 5 determination of droplet size distribution optical microscopy zeiss axio imager m2m and laser diffraction horiba la 950 particle size analyzer were both employed as complementary methods to measure droplet size droplet size was measured after the emulsions reached equilibrium 72 h the low homogenization samples tended to have larger droplets and thus were more suited for microscopy the high homogenization samples contain smaller droplets and laser diffraction allowed for more explicit quantification of the droplet size distribution 2 5 1 microscopy the emulsion samples were gently inverted to suspend the cream layer transferred to a glass microscope slide and protected by a cover glass all measurements were collected on a zeiss axio imager m2m with transmitted light using a 5 numerical aperture na 0 13 10 na 0 25 and if appropriate 20 na 0 50 objective three images were collected of each sample in order to generate a representative droplet size distribution all images were processed using mipar v3 2 mipar worthington oh a commercially available software that uses adaptive thresholding to automatically differentiate features in an image for quantification 27 2 5 2 laser diffraction laser diffraction data was collected on a horiba la 950 particle size analyzer samples were added to a flow loop containing deionized water until the transmittance was within the proper range as specified by the instrument three measurements were performed for each sample if necessary additional sample was added between measurements to maintain the proper transmittance the refractive index of water the continuous phase was specified as 1 333 and the refractive index of light mineral oil was specified as 1 4 all laser diffraction data were imported and processed in matlab r2018b 3 results 3 1 experimentally determined properties of surfactants and cleaners 3 1 1 model surfactants the cmc cmcift equilibrium surface tension above cmc γcmc air and equilibrium ift above cmcift γcmc oil were measured for the three model surfactants triton x 100 triton cg 110 and sds these results are shown in table 1 sds had the largest cmc at 1 983 ppm followed by triton cg 110 with a cmc of 1 748 triton x 100 had the lowest cmc at 102 ppm while cmc is typically defined by surface tension ift measurements can also be used to determine cmc 28 table 1 shows that the cmc calculated using the two different datasets can be significantly different for example the cmcift for triton x 100 was more than three times the cmc rosen and kunjappu 13 reported a similar finding with cmc values up to 20 greater for ift based cmc measurements compared to surface tension based cmc measurements and attributed to the difference to surfactant partitioning into the oil phase in fact they were able to estimate partition coefficients for the surfactants k based on difference in cmc values other studies have also observed larger cmc values for oil water interfaces compared to air water interfaces but attributed the difference to how surfactants pack at each interface 14 15 the equilibrium surface tension for sds above cmc was found to be larger than triton x 100 and triton cg 110 which is in agreement with literature 29 while surface tension gives some indication of surfactant properties ift is more relevant for describing emulsion systems and understanding emulsion formation and stabilization it is widely accepted that emulsion droplet size will decrease with decreasing ift 16 30 31 sds had a much larger equilibrium ift with mineral oil compared to triton x 100 and triton cg 110 the ift for sds triton x 100 and triton cg 110 with mineral oil were 9 8 2 2 and 3 0 mn m respectively therefore emulsions prepared with sds should have larger droplet diameters compared to triton x 100 and triton cg 110 this was experimentally confirmed and is discussed in section 3 3 ifts determined in this study were similar to those listed in literature 31 32 using the measured ift for the three model surfactants the maximum surface concentration and langmuir constant of the surfactants were determined first the maximum surface concentration γ indicates the maximum molar packing density of the surfactant molecules being adsorbed into the interface 33 then the langmuir constant κ gives the affinity of the surfactant molecules to the interface 19 35 36 to obtain both maximum surface concentration and langmuir constant the gibbs adsorption energy equation is first introduced to relate the ift to the bulk surfactant concentration 34 1 γ 1 n r t γ l n c t where n depends on the surfactant type for instance n 1 for non ionic and n 2 for anionic surfactant respectively r is the gas constant t is the ambient temperature c is the bulk surfactant concentration and γ is the ift next the langmuir isotherm is applied to eq 1 to obtain an equation of state 37 2 γ e q γ κ c 1 κ c 3 γ γ 0 n r t γ l n 1 κ c 1 κ c where γ 0 is the ift of the system with no surfactant the equation of state eq 3 is fit to the ift data in fig 1 a to extract the values of γ and κ of each surfactant the molecular weight of the surfactants m w as well as γ and κ are listed within a 50 confidence interval in table 2 the values of γ and κ listed in table 2 are within the appropriate order of magnitude of typical model surfactants 36 38 in this study the γ values of all three surfactants were similar for the oil water and air water cases suggesting comparable surface coverage regardless of the interface the reason for the differences in the cmc values table 1 may be due to partitioning of the surfactant in the oil phase however given that ift measurements were similar between two methods that used different oil to water ratios fig s2 other mechanisms may instead be responsible for the increase in cmc another explanation is that potential impurities found in mineral oil may be modifying the structure of water and changing entropy of micellization rosen 13 discusses the impact of class ii materials e g short chain alcohols water soluble esters ethylene glycol and dioxane on cmc materials that decrease the solubility parameter of water may increase cmc because they increase the solubility of the monomeric form of surfactants likewise compounds that reduce the dielectric constant of water would increase the mutual repulsion of ionic heads in the micelle thus opposing micellization and increase the cmc this may also explain the higher cmc of oil water than that of air water interfaces the adsorption constant κ varied significantly between the surfactants particularly it shows that the triton x 100 was the most active to be adsorbed to the interface among the three surfactants in addition the values of κ of oil water interface were higher than that of the air water interface suggesting that for a given surfactant the adsorption of the surfactant molecules to the oil water interface are more active than to the air water interface the results shown in table 2 were able to provide some insight into the underlying relationship between surfactant concentration and ift surface tension for a given surfactant and resultant degree of oil separation for a given measurements as discussed in section 3 2 3 1 2 commercial cleaners four commercial cleaners were identified as likely to be present in bilgewater tanks of armed forces vessels based on a previous inventory survey 3 these include blast off prc deck floor cleaner solid surge and type 1 detergent the composition of the cleaners is proprietary and the concentration and chemical structures are unknown however the material and safety data sheets msds indicate the primary surfactants for all the cleaners are nonionic 3 nevertheless builders stabilizers and secondary surfactants which may not be included in the msds will also impact how the surfactants interact with an oil water interface as indicated by the discrepancy in surfactant properties for example between triton x 100 and type 1 detergent therefore the only way to predict the impact that these cleaners will have on emulsion stability is to identify the properties of the cleaners experimentally cmcift for the four cleaners was calculated based on data presented in fig 1b which ranged significantly type 1 detergent had the lowest cmcift at 105 ppm then solid surge with a cmcift of 396 ppm blast off had a cmcift of 5 381 ppm and prc deck floor cleaner had the largest cmcift at 6 832 ppm table 1 the large range of cmcift values between the cleaners was ideal for determining the impact of cmcift on emulsion stability likewise the equilibrium ift measurements with mineral oil above cmcift also varied significantly between the commercial cleaners table 1 the cleaner with the lowest equilibrium ift above cmc was type 1 detergent with an ift of 2 14 mn m blast off and solid surge had ifts of 3 44 mn m and 4 08 mn m respectively prc deck cleaner had the largest ift above cmc with an ift of 7 68 mn m interestingly ift s of the commercial cleaners above cmc were within a similar range as the model surfactants 3 2 emulsion stability macro phase oil separation in many cases macro phase oil separation was visually observed fig s5 however the oil layer was only visible from above and could not be clearly photographed from the side fig s4 therefore emulsion stability was quantified by weighing the amount of oil that was separated from the creaming layer and aqueous phase using a separatory funnel fig 2 shows the quantity of oil that coalesced into a separate phase as a fraction of the initial amount of oil added with increasing surfactant concentration shown as percentage of cmcift the effects of oil content homogenization speed and surfactant concentration were compared 3 2 1 effect of cmc on macro phase oil separation for all surfactants in each condition the amount of oil separation decreased with increasing surfactant concentration fig 2 at larger concentrations of surfactant more oil was contained in the surfactant stabilized emulsions the specific concentration at which each sample shifted from predominantly separated oil to stabilized emulsion correlated closely with cmcift surprisingly macro phase oil separation was relatively independent of oil content under high and low homogenization similar relationships of macro phase oil separation with surfactant concentration were observed for both 10 and 20 mineral oil contents one possible explanation for this finding is that surface area to volume ratio of droplets could have been similar between 10 and 20 mineral oil as droplet size is independent of oil content thus the interfacial area only doubles for the increase in mineral oil content from 10 to 20 for example assuming a uniform droplet size of 3 μm the surface area would only increase from approximately 200 to 400 m2 l for 10 and 20 oil respectively from the maximum surface concentrations calculated in table 2 the increased surface area would only consume an extra 6 10 4 moles of surfactant or a few hundred ppm depending on the surfactant thus the difference in stability with increased oil concentration may be obscured by the large increments of surfactant concentration used in this study an even more compelling explanation is that droplets coalesce to a droplet size distribution with a surface area that can be supported by the surfactant s cmcift this could be why d50 or the droplet diameter at 50 cumulative distribution decreases with surfactant concentration above cmcift section 3 3 the additional surfactant can be used to stabilize the larger surface area of the smaller droplet size distribution an increased dependency on homogenization intensity at low surfactant concentrations was also observed in fig 2 the greater dependence on homogenization intensity at low surfactant concentrations has been observed in literature 22 and occurs because at low surfactant concentrations the interfacial energy is large therefore more energy is needed to disrupt the oil water interface into droplets model equations have been developed to predict the relationship between homogenization intensity and emulsion stability in surfactant rich and poor regimes 16 39 however it is not clear if cmc or cmcift can be used to define whether an emulsion system is surfactant rich or poor in tcholakova et al 16 the authors defined surfactant rich as concentrations greater than 0 1 wt for sds emulsions rather than using the cmc of sds 0 24 wt likewise maindarkar et al 22 used 0 1 wt for emulsions stabilized by pluronic f 68 which has a cmc of 334 ppm maindarkar et al 22 also indicated that the surfactant rich regime depends strongly on the oil concentration in our experiments it was clearly shown that surfactant rich or surfactant poor regimes can be defined by the cmcift fig 2 rather than by a specific surfactant concentration or oil concentration 3 2 2 effect of ift on macro phase oil separation ift is known to have a large impact on emulsion droplet size distribution and stability fig 3 shows the oil separation as a function of ift for the three model surfactants with varying oil concentration and homogenization intensity for all surfactant types oil concentrations and homogenization intensities oil separation increased as ift increased as ift deceases the energy required to disrupt the oil water interface is reduced and allows for a smaller droplet size distribution model equations presented by walstra et al 40 and tcholakova et al 16 show that droplet diameter depends primarily on the oil water ift under surfactant rich regimes in this study there are clear differences between the effects of ift under high and low intensity homogenization fig 3 for high intensity homogenization the relationship between ift and emulsion stability varied between surfactant types this is likely due to the differences in langmuir constants observed between the surfactants table 2 larger κ values are associated with more active surfactants 19 here the κ value of triton x 100 was two orders of magnitude larger than that for sds which informs why γoil for triton x 100 is notably lower than that for sds for a given surfactant concentration fig 1a the triton x 100 system also had the steepest slope in percent of oil separation for a given ift fig 3a and b due to the larger κ value and resultant lower surfactant concentration and interfacial coverage at a given ift likewise the oil separation of sds stabilized emulsions was the least dependent on ift due to the lower κ value and relatively saturated surfactant coverage for a given ift for example for emulsions prepared under high intensity homogenization and 20 mineral oil fig 3a sds demonstrated greater than 50 oil separation when ift was above 37 mn m however emulsions prepared with triton cg 110 demonstrated similar oil separation when ift was above 23 mn m and 17 mn m for triton x 100 emulsions prepared using low intensity homogenization demonstrated a steep decrease in emulsion stability between 5 and 15 mn m regardless of surfactant type fig 3b d this difference in oil separation for the high intensity and low intensity homogenization is likely due to the formation and stabilization of emulsion droplets for samples prepared with high intensity homogenization there was an excess of energy where droplets were being broken up and re coalesced at a rate similar to the rate of surfactant mass transport 17 41 for samples prepared with low intensity homogenization mechanical energy input into the system was limited and ift determined the fragmentation of droplets therefore the homogenization intensity has an impact on the importance of ift on emulsion stability 3 3 droplet size distribution the average diameters of the emulsions droplet size were determined by optical microscopy and laser diffraction the effects of homogenization speed surfactant type oil content and surfactant concentration on droplet size distribution are shown in fig 4 where d50 represents the droplet diameter at 50 of the cumulative distribution as expected emulsions prepared by high speed homogenization created droplets of much smaller diameter 10 25 μm than those prepared by low speed homogenization 25 550 μm droplet size was independent of oil content for each surfactant however droplet size did depend on surfactant type and concentration as well as homogenization speed for the all surfactants droplet size decreased with increasing surfactant concentration considering droplet size was only measured in samples above cmcift this result was somewhat surprising ideally ift should be at equilibrium when the surfactant concentration is above cmcift therefore droplet size distribution was expected to be constant above cmcift the discrepancy could be explained by the method of ift measurement ift was measured using the du noüy ring method which means the surfactant loss to the interface is negligible however in an emulsion system the small droplets create a very large interfacial area that can adsorb a significant amount of surfactant 31 as such increasing surfactant concentration beyond the cmcift effectively increases the capacity for the maximum interfacial area without affecting measurable ift therefore with greater capacity for increased interfacial area more droplets of smaller diameter are formed at increasing surfactant concentrations above cmcift in addition droplet size was measured after 72 h therefore droplet size during homogenization may have been equal for emulsion systems with similar ift and it was the coalescence over the 72 h that resulted in a change in droplet size distribution with increasing surfactant concentration the effect of surfactant concentration on droplet size was much larger at low intensity homogenization compared to high homogenization the d50 of an sds emulsion at 8 000 ppm was 300 μm but decreased to 132 μm at sds 10 000 ppm triton x 100 and triton cg 110 both shared this relationship between surfactant concentration and droplet size during an emulsification process the interfacial area increases significantly and droplets are divided to form smaller droplets below a certain droplet size there will not be enough surfactant to cover the interface completely therefore the droplet will tend to coalesce until the interfacial area is saturated with surfactant 42 in this case droplet size distribution is mostly dependent on surfactant concentration and oil volume fraction under high homogenization 3 4 commercially stabilized emulsions to determine if the transition of emulsion behavior near cmcift in emulsion samples prepared with model surfactants fig 2 can be used to predict the behavior of bilgewater emulsions the oil separation of emulsion samples prepared using commercial cleaners was analyzed fig 5 shows the percent oil separation after 72 h for various concentrations of prc deck cleaner blast off solid surge and type 1 detergent under high and low homogenization intensities the discontinuity of oil separation at cmcift was also apparent for the commercial cleaners prc deck cleaner blast off and solid surge all demonstrated an inflection of oil separation near cmcift oil separation in emulsion samples prepared with commercial cleaners were also compared to cmc values determined using traditional surface tension measurements fig s6 in this case oil separation did not correspond well to cmc for example emulsions prepared with prc deck cleaner displayed greater than 80 oil separation for concentrations 10 times higher than cmc likewise prc deck cleaner emulsions prepared under low intensity homogenization did not demonstrate an inflection of oil separation until 5 cmc the difference in relationship between oil separation as a function of cmc compared to a function of cmcift can be explained by how surfactants adsorb at an interface in particular certain components of the cleaners that typically adsorb at the air water interface may be miscible in mineral oil therefore they would not contribute in reducing the ift thus more cleaner would be needed to reach a maximum surface concentration as such cmcift calculated based on ift measurements were more useful for predicting emulsion stability the trend demonstrated in figs 2 and 5 show how a cleaner s cmcift can be used to predict its ability to stabilized bilgewater emulsions 3 5 cmcift as a practical method for qualifying shipboard cleaners results from this study indicate cmcift as a practical and experimental parameter for predicting a cleaner s likelihood of developing stable emulsions therefore it is recommended that cmcift be used to evaluate the risk of using a particular shipboard cleaner for example if a cleaner is determined to have a cmcift of 105 ppm as was the case for type 1 detergent table 1 the risk of that cleaner contributing to emulsion stability would be much larger than that of a cleaner with a cmcift of 6 832 ppm as was observed with prc this is because only a small amount of type 1 detergent needs to be present in the bilge before the concentration reaches cmcift to put it in perspective only 0 5 gals of type 1 detergent would need to make its way into a 5 000 gal bilge tank before the concentration exceeded the cmcift where 34 gals of prc would have to be added to the same size tank before its cmcift was reached however it is important that cmc be measured under representative conditions for example when cmc was measured using surface tension measurements i e aqueous air interface the inflection point of oil separation was up to 10 times smaller than the cmcift fig s6 the discrepancy in predicting emulsion behavior between cmc measured using surface tension cmc and ift measurements cmcift is likely attributable to components in cleaners that decrease surface tension but do not actually contribute to the electrostatic or steric stabilization while the results from this study are promising emulsions prepared in a lab do not represent the complexity and variability of emulsions seen in ship bilges the salinity ph oil composition and temperature of bilgewater can vary significantly depending on daily shipboard activities 3 all of which can influence cmc and emulsion stability therefore it is extremely difficult to account for all parameters that may impact emulsion stability the goal of this study was not to use cmcift as a quantitative predictor of emulsion stability but instead to understand how cmcift impacts emulsion stability and to provide decision makers with a tool for flagging potentially problematic cleaners from being used on ships 4 conclusions the complexity of bilgewater makes the relationship between cleaner components and emulsion stability difficult to predict concentration and types of oil are constantly changing which can directly affect how different types of surfactants will interact with the oil water interface also cleaner chemical compositions are proprietary and therefore largely unknown in this study we have investigated experimental properties of emulsion systems that could be used to predict emulsion stability in particular we evaluated how ift cmc and cmcift impact macro phase oil separation in model surfactants and commercial cleaners the emulsion samples shifted from predominantly separated oil to stabilized emulsion at surfactant concentrations correlating closely with cmcift the change in emulsion behavior is due to the packing of surfactant at the oil water interface as the surfactant concentration approaches cmcift the amount of surfactant adsorbed at the interface approaches its highest packing density and the mechanical stability of the surfactant layer can be expected to be largest thus improving emulsion stabilization in addition it was found that neither ift nor droplet size was directly related to the breaking of a cream layer into a separate oil layer therefore the stability of the emulsions prepared in this study is best explained by an electrostatic steric stabilizing mechanism rather than the initial droplet formation in conclusion cmcift has been demonstrated as a practical and experimental method to predict emulsions stability for complex systems cleaners developed for use on ships could be tested for cmcift using a representative oil and flagged as having a greater potential contribution to bilgewater

13694,oil in water emulsions created in shipboard bilgewater can be challenging to treat to hydrocarbon limiting environmental discharge regulations while emulsion behavior has been widely studied in other disciplines research on bilgewater emulsions has been limited due to the variability of bilgewater composition in this context surfactant types and concentrations are generally unknown therefore experimental properties of neat surfactants and commercial cleaners were evaluated for predicting bilgewater emulsion stability critical micelle concentration cmc cmc in the presence of oil cmcift and equilibrium interfacial tension ift were investigated for emulsion stability using different surfactant types oil concentrations and homogenization energies it was found that cmc was significantly larger in the presence of mineral oil γ values of all three surfactants were similar for the oil water and air water cases however the κ values were larger for the oil water interface suggesting that for a given surfactant the adsorption of the surfactant molecules to the oil water interface was more active than to the air water interface it was also determined that emulsion stability was most closely related to cmcift coalescence into a separated oil layer was only observed in emulsion samples with surfactant concentrations below cmcift this relationship was observed for different homogenization intensities and oil concentrations experiments also validated the relationship between cmcift and oil separation in more complex formulations of commercial cleaners commonly found aboard ships four different cleaners with unique compositions all demonstrated separated oil at concentrations below cmcift overall cmcift represents a practical way to evaluate a cleaner s likelihood of developing stable 72 h with no observable oil separation emulsions in bilgewater keywords bilgewater critical micelle concentration cleaners emulsion interfacial tension 1 introduction bilgewater is a regulated shipboard wastewater composed of seawater oils solvents surfactants and particulate matter that accumulates in the lowest parts of a ship 1 2 oil pollution abatement opa systems are employed for the purpose of managing shipboard bilgewater or oily wastewater to comply with environmental regulations 3 free oils can be readily separated from the water phase by simple physical processes like gravity separation however oil in water emulsions formed in bilgewater i e chemical emulsions are notoriously difficult to break 4 5 therefore it is critical to develop innovative methods for separating oil from water to ensure proper on board bilgewater treatment a fundamental understanding of emulsion stabilization in bilgewater could enable targeted emulsion management strategies the stability of oil in water emulsions are widely studied in food science cosmetics agro chemicals paints and pharmaceuticals 6 8 in these disciplines of research surfactants can be carefully selected to stabilize emulsions based on the dispersed or continuous phases in addition to their robustness to environmental conditions 8 from these studies it has been found that emulsion stability depends strongly on the droplet size type and concentration of surfactant used the viscosity of the continuous phase and other environmental conditions 9 in fact in cases where emulsions are designed to remain stable for long periods of time e g on the order of years tight control of these parameters is necessary to prevent emulsion destabilization mechanisms such as flocculation creaming ostwald ripening and coalescence 10 11 in the context of oily wastewater treatment such as bilgewater surfactant types and concentrations are generally unknown or highly variable 3 12 therefore it is difficult to predict stability of oily wastewater emulsions on a fundamental level for bilgewater applications it is desirable to relate experimentally obtained properties of common shipboard cleaners to emulsion stability components of commercial cleaners are often proprietary therefore it is important to have an empirical method for determining the stabilization imparted by commercial cleaners ideally specific experimentally derived properties of the cleaners or surfactants could be used to predict their behavior in bilgewater systems two experimentally determined properties of surfactants that have been associated with droplet stability in traditional systems are critical micelle concentration cmc and interfacial tension ift cmc is the concentration of surfactant above which micellization becomes thermodynamically favorable and any additional surfactant added to the system forms micelles cmc can be determined experimentally using several methods including surface tension ift dye micellization or conductivity 13 for each method the cmc is defined as the surfactant concentration above which the measured parameter becomes independent of surfactant concentration while some research has indicated a significant change in emulsion stability when an emulsifier concentration is above the cmc 14 15 other studies have found that cmc is not an important parameter for emulsion stability 16 17 one explanation for this discrepancy is that cmc is almost exclusively reported based on measurements in the aqueous phase i e surface tension measurements however some studies have shown cmc can change in the presence of an oil phase when a surfactant is solubilized by the second phase 13 18 considering oil is a major component of emulsions cmc should also be calculated using the ift measurements between an aqueous and representative oil phase cmcift ift is the measurement of the work as mn m required to increase the size of the interface between two immiscible liquids and plays an important role in the formation of emulsion droplets during emulsification 19 in fact theoretical analysis and experimental results have shown that droplet diameter depends on the power density of energy dissipation and the oil water ift 20 21 many model equations have been developed to relate ift and emulsification energy to droplet size and emulsion stability 22 24 while there are multiple examples of research relating cmc and ift to emulsion stability 15 17 22 these studies were performed under carefully controlled environments in particular it is unclear whether the cmc cmcift or ift of a shipboard cleaner i e a mixture of surfactants and other compounds can be used to predict emulsion stability the role of cmc cmcift or ift in predicting emulsion stability is likely to differ with emulsification energy and or oil concentration in addition defining emulsion stability by creaming rate rather than oil separation will also influence the impact of cmc or ift on stability this is because creaming rate measures how effectively oil droplets are able to stay suspended in the bulk layer and is ultimately governed by differences in phase densities and droplet size distribution however oil separation requires coalescence a mechanism that is dependent on many factors including surfactant concentration type and adsorption in the context of bilgewater it is important to break the emulsions into a completely separate oil layer to reduce the volume of stored waste oil and to avoid fouling equipment with cream the current study looks at the relationship between cmc cmcift and ift on emulsion formation and stability using different surfactant types oil concentrations and homogenization energies to determine the usefulness of experimentally determined cleaner properties for predicting emulsion stability in bilgewater emulsions were prepared with representative non ionic surfactants triton x 100 and triton cg 110 and a representative anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds to understand how emulsions behave using pure surfactants then to explore the applicability of using cmc cmcift and ift to explain emulsion

solvents were used as received unless otherwise noted 2 2 characterization of surfactant properties 2 2 1 interfacial and surface tension measurements ift of the surfactant solutions were measured using a du noüy ring tensiometer sigma 701 attension measurements were conducted for each surfactant at 9 different concentrations ranging from 10 ppm to 10 000 ppm 40 ml of mineral oil was carefully added to 80 ml of a surfactant solution to create a clean interface without any bubbles a platinum ring was lowered into the oil portion of the sample and the tensiometer was blanked next the interface was left undisturbed for at least 5 min to allow for surfactant adsorption at the interface to reach equilibrium the tensiometer then automatically determined the location of the oil water interface by lowing the ring through the sample until a change in force of 0 03 mn m was detected next the tensiometer measured the force required to pull the ring back through the oil water interface and recorded the ift in mn m since the ring disturbed the oil water interface during the measurement new samples were prepared for each replicate the du noüy ring was cleaned with isopropanol and dried between each measurement measurements were performed in duplicate surface tension was measured using the same method as ift except that the measurement was made between the air water interface rather than an oil water interface surface tension measurements were performed continuously until the surface tension reached equilibrium generally within 5 min equilibrium was defined as 10 consecutive surface tension measurements with less than a 0 5 mn m deviation experiments were conducted at room temperature 20 22 c after finding that cmc was significantly different in the presence of mineral oil ift measurements were repeated using pendant drop method to monitor ift over time and ensure that equilibrium was reached a goniometer model 210 ramehart was used for the pendant drop analysis since mineral oil is less dense than water a j hook needle was used to suspend the mineral oil droplet in the surfactant solutions ift was measured every 30 secs for 1 5 hrs in general equilibrium was reached within 60 min fig s1 despite the longer time needed to reach equilibrium the equilibrium ift values were generally within 10 of the values obtained using the du nouy ring method fig s2 2 2 2 critical micelle concentration cmc while cmc values of surfactants are typically reported based on surface tension measurements it is assumed that in the case of bilgewater emulsions cmc measurements based on ift measurements will be more representative due to differences in surfactant packing at an oil water interface thus in this work cmc was determined using both surface tension and ift measurements 25 the cmc derived from ift measurements will be noted as cmcift to calculate cmc and cmcift the equilibrium surface tension or ift of a series of surfactant solutions were plotted against the surfactant concentration on a semi log plot the data was then fit with two linear regressions one regression was used to fit the data below cmc a regime where the ift or surface tension are dependent on surfactant concentration the second regression was fit to the data above cmc where the ift or surface tension are independent of surfactant concentration the cmc and cmcift were then calculated by determining the intersection between the concentration dependent and independent regions using origin 2018b 2 3 preparation of emulsions emulsion samples were prepared with mineral oil light deionized di water and a single surfactant or cleaner mineral oil was used due to its viscosity and density being similar to that of collected bilge oil mineral oil is also present in common shipboard lubricating oils i e lube oil 2190 many bilgewater treatment studies reporting the use of standard bilge mixes were composed of diesel fuel and lubricating oils 3 however aromatic compounds and fuel additives found in these mixtures make it difficult directly relate emulsion stability to properties of cleaners 26 all samples were prepared with the same 10 surfactant concentrations 0 10 50 100 500 1 000 2 000 4 000 8 000 and 10 000 ppm in order to observe emulsion stability above and below cmc for each surfactant emulsions were generated with either 10 or 20 v v mineral oil to generate the oil fraction of interest an appropriate volume of mineral oil was added to the surfactant solutions such that the total volume was 20 ml samples were then emulsified using either a high or low intensity homogenization to understand the impacts of cmc cmcift and ift under different homogenization regimes high intensity homogenization samples were homogenized using a high shear homogenizer omni tissue master model 125 10 mm generator probe at 20 000 rpm for 2 min in a 50 ml centrifuge tube fisher sci 14 959 49a and poured into a 50 ml glass flat bottom vials with teflon lined screw caps qorpak glc01020 low intensity homogenization samples were placed in glass sample vials capped and then inverted 10 times bulk emulsion stability experiments were performed at room temperature 20 22 c 2 4 characterization of bulk emulsion stability 2 4 1 bulk emulsion stability immediately after emulsion preparation samples were placed on a shelf where energy input from vibrations and changes in temperature 20 22 c were limited photos of the samples were taken using a digital camera nikon d80 every 30 min for the first 4 h then every 24 h up to 72 h changes in the appearance of the emulsion cream and oil layers were recorded and used to qualitatively indicate emulsion stability a full experimental flight emulsions at all 10 concentrations was performed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility in addition triplicate samples of each model surfactant and cleaner were prepared at cmc and 7 cmc photographs of macro phase separation from these samples showed the results to be highly reproducible supplementary information si fig s3 table s1 2 4 2 macro phase oil separation during the bulk emulsion stability experiments the creaming layer obscured the view of the separated oil phase fig s4 therefore a separation technique was employed to quantify the oil separation after the emulsion samples reached equilibrium 72 h samples were poured into a 100 ml separatory funnel and settled for 5 min to allow the sample to separate into its emulsion cream and oil layers a pre weighed vial was then used to collect the separated oil layer and weighed to determine the amount of oil separation for each sample the oil separation termed macro phase oil separation was presented as a percentage of the total oil used in the emulsion generation 2 5 determination of droplet size distribution optical microscopy zeiss axio imager m2m and laser diffraction horiba la 950 particle size analyzer were both employed as complementary methods to measure droplet size droplet size was measured after the emulsions reached equilibrium 72 h the low homogenization samples tended to have larger droplets and thus were more suited for microscopy the high homogenization samples contain smaller droplets and laser diffraction allowed for more explicit quantification of the droplet size distribution 2 5 1 microscopy the emulsion samples were gently inverted to suspend the cream layer transferred to a glass microscope slide and protected by a cover glass all measurements were collected on a zeiss axio imager m2m with transmitted light using a 5 numerical aperture na 0 13 10 na 0 25 and if appropriate 20 na 0 50 objective three images were collected of each sample in order to generate a representative droplet size distribution all images were processed using mipar v3 2 mipar worthington oh a commercially available software that uses adaptive thresholding to automatically differentiate features in an image for quantification 27 2 5 2 laser diffraction laser diffraction data was collected on a horiba la 950 particle size analyzer samples were added to a flow loop containing deionized water until the transmittance was within the proper range as specified by the instrument three measurements were performed for each sample if necessary additional sample was added between measurements to maintain the proper transmittance the refractive index of water the continuous phase was specified as 1 333 and the refractive index of light mineral oil was specified as 1 4 all laser diffraction data were imported and processed in matlab r2018b 3 results 3 1 experimentally determined properties of surfactants and cleaners 3 1 1 model surfactants the cmc cmcift equilibrium surface tension above cmc γcmc air and equilibrium ift above cmcift γcmc oil were measured for the three model surfactants triton x 100 triton cg 110 and sds these results are shown in table 1 sds had the largest cmc at 1 983 ppm followed by triton cg 110 with a cmc of 1 748 triton x 100 had the lowest cmc at 102 ppm while cmc is typically defined by surface tension ift measurements can also be used to determine cmc 28 table 1 shows that the cmc calculated using the two different datasets can be significantly different for example the cmcift for triton x 100 was more than three times the cmc rosen and kunjappu 13 reported a similar finding with cmc values up to 20 greater for ift based cmc measurements compared to surface tension based cmc measurements and attributed to the difference to surfactant partitioning into the oil phase in fact they were able to estimate partition coefficients for the surfactants k based on difference in cmc values other studies have also observed larger cmc values for oil water interfaces compared to air water interfaces but attributed the difference to how surfactants pack at each interface 14 15 the equilibrium surface tension for sds above cmc was found to be larger than triton x 100 and triton cg 110 which is in agreement with literature 29 while surface tension gives some indication of surfactant properties ift is more relevant for describing emulsion systems and understanding emulsion formation and stabilization it is widely accepted that emulsion droplet size will decrease with decreasing ift 16 30 31 sds had a much larger equilibrium ift with mineral oil compared to triton x 100 and triton cg 110 the ift for sds triton x 100 and triton cg 110 with mineral oil were 9 8 2 2 and 3 0 mn m respectively therefore emulsions prepared with sds should have larger droplet diameters compared to triton x 100 and triton cg 110 this was experimentally confirmed and is discussed in section 3 3 ifts determined in this study were similar to those listed in literature 31 32 using the measured ift for the three model surfactants the maximum surface concentration and langmuir constant of the surfactants were determined first the maximum surface concentration γ indicates the maximum molar packing density of the surfactant molecules being adsorbed into the interface 33 then the langmuir constant κ gives the affinity of the surfactant molecules to the interface 19 35 36 to obtain both maximum surface concentration and langmuir constant the gibbs adsorption energy equation is first introduced to relate the ift to the bulk surfactant concentration 34 1 γ 1 n r t γ l n c t where n depends on the surfactant type for instance n 1 for non ionic and n 2 for anionic surfactant respectively r is the gas constant t is the ambient temperature c is the bulk surfactant concentration and γ is the ift next the langmuir isotherm is applied to eq 1 to obtain an equation of state 37 2 γ e q γ κ c 1 κ c 3 γ γ 0 n r t γ l n 1 κ c 1 κ c where γ 0 is the ift of the system with no surfactant the equation of state eq 3 is fit to the ift data in fig 1 a to extract the values of γ and κ of each surfactant the molecular weight of the surfactants m w as well as γ and κ are listed within a 50 confidence interval in table 2 the values of γ and κ listed in table 2 are within the appropriate order of magnitude of typical model surfactants 36 38 in this study the γ values of all three surfactants were similar for the oil water and air water cases suggesting comparable surface coverage regardless of the interface the reason for the differences in the cmc values table 1 may be due to partitioning of the surfactant in the oil phase however given that ift measurements were similar between two methods that used different oil to water ratios fig s2 other mechanisms may instead be responsible for the increase in cmc another explanation is that potential impurities found in mineral oil may be modifying the structure of water and changing entropy of micellization rosen 13 discusses the impact of class ii materials e g short chain alcohols water soluble esters ethylene glycol and dioxane on cmc materials that decrease the solubility parameter of water may increase cmc because they increase the solubility of the monomeric form of surfactants likewise compounds that reduce the dielectric constant of water would increase the mutual repulsion of ionic heads in the micelle thus opposing micellization and increase the cmc this may also explain the higher cmc of oil water than that of air water interfaces the adsorption constant κ varied significantly between the surfactants particularly it shows that the triton x 100 was the most active to be adsorbed to the interface among the three surfactants in addition the values of κ of oil water interface were higher than that of the air water interface suggesting that for a given surfactant the adsorption of the surfactant molecules to the oil water interface are more active than to the air water interface the results shown in table 2 were able to provide some insight into the underlying relationship between surfactant concentration and ift surface tension for a given surfactant and resultant degree of oil separation for a given measurements as discussed in section 3 2 3 1 2 commercial cleaners four commercial cleaners were identified as likely to be present in bilgewater tanks of armed forces vessels based on a previous inventory survey 3 these include blast off prc deck floor cleaner solid surge and type 1 detergent the composition of the cleaners is proprietary and the concentration and chemical structures are unknown however the material and safety data sheets msds indicate the primary surfactants for all the cleaners are nonionic 3 nevertheless builders stabilizers and secondary surfactants which may not be included in the msds will also impact how the surfactants interact with an oil water interface as indicated by the discrepancy in surfactant properties for example between triton x 100 and type 1 detergent therefore the only way to predict the impact that these cleaners will have on emulsion stability is to identify the properties of the cleaners experimentally cmcift for the four cleaners was calculated based on data presented in fig 1b which ranged significantly type 1 detergent had the lowest cmcift at 105 ppm then solid surge with a cmcift of 396 ppm blast off had a cmcift of 5 381 ppm and prc deck floor cleaner had the largest cmcift at 6 832 ppm table 1 the large range of cmcift values between the cleaners was ideal for determining the impact of cmcift on emulsion stability likewise the equilibrium ift measurements with mineral oil above cmcift also varied significantly between the commercial cleaners table 1 the cleaner with the lowest equilibrium ift above cmc was type 1 detergent with an ift of 2 14 mn m blast off and solid surge had ifts of 3 44 mn m and 4 08 mn m respectively prc deck cleaner had the largest ift above cmc with an ift of 7 68 mn m interestingly ift s of the commercial cleaners above cmc were within a similar range as the model surfactants 3 2 emulsion stability macro phase oil separation in many cases macro phase oil separation was visually observed fig s5 however the oil layer was only visible from above and could not be clearly photographed from the side fig s4 therefore emulsion stability was quantified by weighing the amount of oil that was separated from the creaming layer and aqueous phase using a separatory funnel fig 2 shows the quantity of oil that coalesced into a separate phase as a fraction of the initial amount of oil added with increasing surfactant concentration shown as percentage of cmcift the effects of oil content homogenization speed and surfactant concentration were compared 3 2 1 effect of cmc on macro phase oil separation for all surfactants in each condition the amount of oil separation decreased with increasing surfactant concentration fig 2 at larger concentrations of surfactant more oil was contained in the surfactant stabilized emulsions the specific concentration at which each sample shifted from predominantly separated oil to stabilized emulsion correlated closely with cmcift surprisingly macro phase oil separation was relatively independent of oil content under high and low homogenization similar relationships of macro phase oil separation with surfactant concentration were observed for both 10 and 20 mineral oil contents one possible explanation for this finding is that surface area to volume ratio of droplets could have been similar between 10 and 20 mineral oil as droplet size is independent of oil content thus the interfacial area only doubles for the increase in mineral oil content from 10 to 20 for example assuming a uniform droplet size of 3 μm the surface area would only increase from approximately 200 to 400 m2 l for 10 and 20 oil respectively from the maximum surface concentrations calculated in table 2 the increased surface area would only consume an extra 6 10 4 moles of surfactant or a few hundred ppm depending on the surfactant thus the difference in stability with increased oil concentration may be obscured by the large increments of surfactant concentration used in this study an even more compelling explanation is that droplets coalesce to a droplet size distribution with a surface area that can be supported by the surfactant s cmcift this could be why d50 or the droplet diameter at 50 cumulative distribution decreases with surfactant concentration above cmcift section 3 3 the additional surfactant can be used to stabilize the larger surface area of the smaller droplet size distribution an increased dependency on homogenization intensity at low surfactant concentrations was also observed in fig 2 the greater dependence on homogenization intensity at low surfactant concentrations has been observed in literature 22 and occurs because at low surfactant concentrations the interfacial energy is large therefore more energy is needed to disrupt the oil water interface into droplets model equations have been developed to predict the relationship between homogenization intensity and emulsion stability in surfactant rich and poor regimes 16 39 however it is not clear if cmc or cmcift can be used to define whether an emulsion system is surfactant rich or poor in tcholakova et al 16 the authors defined surfactant rich as concentrations greater than 0 1 wt for sds emulsions rather than using the cmc of sds 0 24 wt likewise maindarkar et al 22 used 0 1 wt for emulsions stabilized by pluronic f 68 which has a cmc of 334 ppm maindarkar et al 22 also indicated that the surfactant rich regime depends strongly on the oil concentration in our experiments it was clearly shown that surfactant rich or surfactant poor regimes can be defined by the cmcift fig 2 rather than by a specific surfactant concentration or oil concentration 3 2 2 effect of ift on macro phase oil separation ift is known to have a large impact on emulsion droplet size distribution and stability fig 3 shows the oil separation as a function of ift for the three model surfactants with varying oil concentration and homogenization intensity for all surfactant types oil concentrations and homogenization intensities oil separation increased as ift increased as ift deceases the energy required to disrupt the oil water interface is reduced and allows for a smaller droplet size distribution model equations presented by walstra et al 40 and tcholakova et al 16 show that droplet diameter depends primarily on the oil water ift under surfactant rich regimes in this study there are clear differences between the effects of ift under high and low intensity homogenization fig 3 for high intensity homogenization the relationship between ift and emulsion stability varied between surfactant types this is likely due to the differences in langmuir constants observed between the surfactants table 2 larger κ values are associated with more active surfactants 19 here the κ value of triton x 100 was two orders of magnitude larger than that for sds which informs why γoil for triton x 100 is notably lower than that for sds for a given surfactant concentration fig 1a the triton x 100 system also had the steepest slope in percent of oil separation for a given ift fig 3a and b due to the larger κ value and resultant lower surfactant concentration and interfacial coverage at a given ift likewise the oil separation of sds stabilized emulsions was the least dependent on ift due to the lower κ value and relatively saturated surfactant coverage for a given ift for example for emulsions prepared under high intensity homogenization and 20 mineral oil fig 3a sds demonstrated greater than 50 oil separation when ift was above 37 mn m however emulsions prepared with triton cg 110 demonstrated similar oil separation when ift was above 23 mn m and 17 mn m for triton x 100 emulsions prepared using low intensity homogenization demonstrated a steep decrease in emulsion stability between 5 and 15 mn m regardless of surfactant type fig 3b d this difference in oil separation for the high intensity and low intensity homogenization is likely due to the formation and stabilization of emulsion droplets for samples prepared with high intensity homogenization there was an excess of energy where droplets were being broken up and re coalesced at a rate similar to the rate of surfactant mass transport 17 41 for samples prepared with low intensity homogenization mechanical energy input into the system was limited and ift determined the fragmentation of droplets therefore the homogenization intensity has an impact on the importance of ift on emulsion stability 3 3 droplet size distribution the average diameters of the emulsions droplet size were determined by optical microscopy and laser diffraction the effects of homogenization speed surfactant type oil content and surfactant concentration on droplet size distribution are shown in fig 4 where d50 represents the droplet diameter at 50 of the cumulative distribution as expected emulsions prepared by high speed homogenization created droplets of much smaller diameter 10 25 μm than those prepared by low speed homogenization 25 550 μm droplet size was independent of oil content for each surfactant however droplet size did depend on surfactant type and concentration as well as homogenization speed for the all surfactants droplet size decreased with increasing surfactant concentration considering droplet size was only measured in samples above cmcift this result was somewhat surprising ideally ift should be at equilibrium when the surfactant concentration is above cmcift therefore droplet size distribution was expected to be constant above cmcift the discrepancy could be explained by the method of ift measurement ift was measured using the du noüy ring method which means the surfactant loss to the interface is negligible however in an emulsion system the small droplets create a very large interfacial area that can adsorb a significant amount of surfactant 31 as such increasing surfactant concentration beyond the cmcift effectively increases the capacity for the maximum interfacial area without affecting measurable ift therefore with greater capacity for increased interfacial area more droplets of smaller diameter are formed at increasing surfactant concentrations above cmcift in addition droplet size was measured after 72 h therefore droplet size during homogenization may have been equal for emulsion systems with similar ift and it was the coalescence over the 72 h that resulted in a change in droplet size distribution with increasing surfactant concentration the effect of surfactant concentration on droplet size was much larger at low intensity homogenization compared to high homogenization the d50 of an sds emulsion at 8 000 ppm was 300 μm but decreased to 132 μm at sds 10 000 ppm triton x 100 and triton cg 110 both shared this relationship between surfactant concentration and droplet size during an emulsification process the interfacial area increases significantly and droplets are divided to form smaller droplets below a certain droplet size there will not be enough surfactant to cover the interface completely therefore the droplet will tend to coalesce until the interfacial area is saturated with surfactant 42 in this case droplet size distribution is mostly dependent on surfactant concentration and oil volume fraction under high homogenization 3 4 commercially stabilized emulsions to determine if the transition of emulsion behavior near cmcift in emulsion samples prepared with model surfactants fig 2 can be used to predict the behavior of bilgewater emulsions the oil separation of emulsion samples prepared using commercial cleaners was analyzed fig 5 shows the percent oil separation after 72 h for various concentrations of prc deck cleaner blast off solid surge and type 1 detergent under high and low homogenization intensities the discontinuity of oil separation at cmcift was also apparent for the commercial cleaners prc deck cleaner blast off and solid surge all demonstrated an inflection of oil separation near cmcift oil separation in emulsion samples prepared with commercial cleaners were also compared to cmc values determined using traditional surface tension measurements fig s6 in this case oil separation did not correspond well to cmc for example emulsions prepared with prc deck cleaner displayed greater than 80 oil separation for concentrations 10 times higher than cmc likewise prc deck cleaner emulsions prepared under low intensity homogenization did not demonstrate an inflection of oil separation until 5 cmc the difference in relationship between oil separation as a function of cmc compared to a function of cmcift can be explained by how surfactants adsorb at an interface in particular certain components of the cleaners that typically adsorb at the air water interface may be miscible in mineral oil therefore they would not contribute in reducing the ift thus more cleaner would be needed to reach a maximum surface concentration as such cmcift calculated based on ift measurements were more useful for predicting emulsion stability the trend demonstrated in figs 2 and 5 show how a cleaner s cmcift can be used to predict its ability to stabilized bilgewater emulsions 3 5 cmcift as a practical method for qualifying shipboard cleaners results from this study indicate cmcift as a practical and experimental parameter for predicting a cleaner s likelihood of developing stable emulsions therefore it is recommended that cmcift be used to evaluate the risk of using a particular shipboard cleaner for example if a cleaner is determined to have a cmcift of 105 ppm as was the case for type 1 detergent table 1 the risk of that cleaner contributing to emulsion stability would be much larger than that of a cleaner with a cmcift of 6 832 ppm as was observed with prc this is because only a small amount of type 1 detergent needs to be present in the bilge before the concentration reaches cmcift to put it in perspective only 0 5 gals of type 1 detergent would need to make its way into a 5 000 gal bilge tank before the concentration exceeded the cmcift where 34 gals of prc would have to be added to the same size tank before its cmcift was reached however it is important that cmc be measured under representative conditions for example when cmc was measured using surface tension measurements i e aqueous air interface the inflection point of oil separation was up to 10 times smaller than the cmcift fig s6 the discrepancy in predicting emulsion behavior between cmc measured using surface tension cmc and ift measurements cmcift is likely attributable to components in cleaners that decrease surface tension but do not actually contribute to the electrostatic or steric stabilization while the results from this study are promising emulsions prepared in a lab do not represent the complexity and variability of emulsions seen in ship bilges the salinity ph oil composition and temperature of bilgewater can vary significantly depending on daily shipboard activities 3 all of which can influence cmc and emulsion stability therefore it is extremely difficult to account for all parameters that may impact emulsion stability the goal of this study was not to use cmcift as a quantitative predictor of emulsion stability but instead to understand how cmcift impacts emulsion stability and to provide decision makers with a tool for flagging potentially problematic cleaners from being used on ships 4 conclusions the complexity of bilgewater makes the relationship between cleaner components and emulsion stability difficult to predict concentration and types of oil are constantly changing which can directly affect how different types of surfactants will interact with the oil water interface also cleaner chemical compositions are proprietary and therefore largely unknown in this study we have investigated experimental properties of emulsion systems that could be used to predict emulsion stability in particular we evaluated how ift cmc and cmcift impact macro phase oil separation in model surfactants and commercial cleaners the emulsion samples shifted from predominantly separated oil to stabilized emulsion at surfactant concentrations correlating closely with cmcift the change in emulsion behavior is due to the packing of surfactant at the oil water interface as the surfactant concentration approaches cmcift the amount of surfactant adsorbed at the interface approaches its highest packing density and the mechanical stability of the surfactant layer can be expected to be largest thus improving emulsion stabilization in addition it was found that neither ift nor droplet size was directly related to the breaking of a cream layer into a separate oil layer therefore the stability of the emulsions prepared in this study is best explained by an electrostatic steric stabilizing mechanism rather than the initial droplet formation in conclusion cmcift has been demonstrated as a practical and experimental method to predict emulsions stability for complex systems cleaners developed for use on ships could be tested for cmcift using a representative oil and flagged as having a greater potential contribution to bilgewater emulsion stability if the cleaner s cmcift was found to be low declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements this work was supported by the
