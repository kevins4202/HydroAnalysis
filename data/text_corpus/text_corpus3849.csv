19245,in an effort to provide early warnings for the occurrence of eutrophication it is highly desirable to develop an accurate and efficient technique to ensure continuous monitoring of dissolved reactive phosphorus drp in the aquatic environment from the viewpoint of environmental management herein a new diffusive gradient in thin film dgt technique was developed and evaluated for in situ measurement of drp in waters in which zr based metal organic frameworks mofs uio 66 were utilized as aqueous binding agent abbreviated as uio 66 dgt as expected the uio 66 dgt demonstrated high uptake capacity towards phosphorus 20 8 μg p cm 2 meanwhile an excellent linearity between the accumulated drp mass and deployment time over 5 d r2 0 996 was obtained regardless of high or low phosphate solution in addition effective diffusion coefficients d of drp increased exponentially with increasing ionic strengths r2 0 99 based on the rectified d the performance of the uio 66 dgt was independent of solution ph 6 5 8 5 and ionic strengths ranging from 0 01 to 100 mmol l 1 furthermore field deployments of the uio 66 dgt were undertaken in a natural eutrophic lake lake chaohu china it was noteworthy that drp could be continually accumulated by the uio 66 dgt for more than 14 d and good agreements were obtained between the concentrations measured by dgt cdgt and those by ex situ chemical extraction method in solution csol as reflected by cdgt csol of 0 9 1 1 in situ determination of drp speciation was also carried out at different sites across lake chaohu overall this study contributed to a better constructing of liquid binding phase dgt for the measurement of drp in waters facilitating the widespread application of the uio 66 dgt as a routine monitoring technique and for large scale environmental analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords diffusive gradients in thin films dissolved reactive phosphorus metal organic frameworks uio 66 in situ measurement 1 introduction water eutrophication is expanding worldwide with increasing magnitude and frequency often resulting in the promotion of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in freshwaters baken et al 2015 fang et al 2018 smil 2003 both nitrogen n and phosphorus p are key factors to accelerate the process of eutrophication chen et al 2018a ding et al 2018a which may vary temporally across seasons geographically with regions and even spatially within a lake xu et al 2015 noteworthy among all species of phosphorus dissolved reactive phosphorus drp play the primary role in sustaining cyanobacterial blooms funes et al 2015 xu et al 2015 therefore the accurate measurement of drp speciation in waters is quite important for the early warning or recovering of eutrophic waters the traditional detection method is based on molybdenum blue spectrophotometry ion chromatography or inductively coupled plasma electrometer guo et al 2005 motomizu et al 1983 ogle et al 2004 before analysis water samples must suffer from several steps including the field sample collection storage transportation and purification which is time consuming and may cause some physical chemical and biological changes of the collected samples during the process moreover it is difficult to objectively reflect the actual distribution of phosphorus in waters thus it is highly desirable to develop an effective in situ sampling technique to accurately measure the concentration of drp in natural waters in order to alleviate the need for preservation and storage of samples it is well recognized that the diffusive gradient in thin film dgt technique as a promising tool for in situ sampling the labile fraction of analytes in waters developed by davison and coworkers in the early 1990s davlson and zhang 1994 zhang et al 1998 has attracted widespread attention in virtue of its possibility of selective sampling of the species as well as avoiding any changes in speciation and significant sample disturbance chen et al 2013 ding et al 2018b guan et al 2015 huynh et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 the primary dgt device was constructed of a thin hydrogel diffusive layer a hydrogel like binding layer and a protective filter membrane chen et al 2017 zhang and davison 1995 in which the dissolved analytes passed through the diffusion layer to the binding layer imbued with the specific binding agent with strong affinity toward the target analyte at a rate governed by fick s first law of diffusion ding et al 2015 it should be mentioned that the binding agents must have sufficiently high capacity to capture the target analytes and ensure the solute concentration to be zero at the boundary between the diffusion layer and the binding layer that is the measurements of different substances depended on the affinity of binding agents used in the dgt devices toward the target substances chen et al 2018b hence development of new binding agents has received increasing attention in recent years various hydrogel binding agents were successfully developed to measure various analytes e g chelex 100 resin for labile metals species wu et al 2015a speron thiol resin for total dissolved mercury docekalová and divis 2005 purolite a520e for nitrate huang et al 2016a and molecularly imprinted polymer for 4 chlorophenol dong et al 2014 concurrently several types of hydrogel binding agents including ferrihydrite titanium dioxide and half dried amorphous zirconium oxide have been extensively used to accumulate drp in aquatic and soil systems ding et al 2010 2013 panther et al 2010 wu et al 2015b zhang et al 1998 despite these huge advances associated with solid binding agents their applications usually suffered from some unavoidable drawbacks such as poor mechanical resistance poor reproducibility and poorly defined gel structure and etc as a result the key to address the above mentioned constraints was to develop novel binding agents for the trapping of drp to provide more reliable data in the past few years the aqueous binding agents received increasing attention due to a great deal of outstanding advantages such as facile for handing and massive production the excellent contact between the binding agent and diffusive layer a theoretically ideal mass transport and well defined reproducible diffusive layer fan et al 2013 rendering them ideal candidates for the binding agents of dgt recently several polymer based liquid binding phases such as poly 4 styrenesulfonate solution li et al 2003 polyquaternary ammonium salt chen et al 2014a and sodium polyacrylate fan et al 2009b have been developed in these studies dialysis membranes were used as diffusive layer to partition and retain the liquid binding phases li et al 2003 the traditional diffusive layer used in dgt was agarose cross linked polyacrylamide apa hydrogel which often interacted electrostatically with metals and adsorbed some compounds via its functional groups zhang and davison 1999 more recently another type of hydrogel agarose was increasingly used as diffusive gels benefiting from its feasibility to a wide range of inorganic and organic analytes wang et al 2016b nevertheless these gels were not suitable for the liquid binding phases because they had an open pore size of 5 μm wang et al 2016b in contrast taking into account a wide variety of pore sizes dialysis membranes could allow the passage of analytes and retain the liquid binding phases liu et al 2016 however only few liquid binding phases were found to be compatible with commercial membranes fan et al 2009a zhang et al 2018 because they often hindered the effective transport of target analytes hence it remains a valuable goal to develop new aqueous binding agents compatible well with various membrane pore structures for realizing the widespread use of such liquid type dgt devices as a new class of porous materials metal organic frameworks mofs can be constructed with high surface areas predictable structures and tunable pore sizes wang et al 2015 which can match with a wide variety of membrane pore structures benefiting from the multiple structure types excellent stability and intriguing properties zr based mofs was expected as one of the most promising mof materials for practical applications audu et al 2016 bai et al 2016 very recently we found that zr based mofs uio 66 presented high affinity towards p gu et al 2017 it was also verified that the zr o nodes in the mofs acted as specific anchors for the effective capture of p via the formation of zr o p bonds bui et al 2018 these precedents prompted us to further propose that uio 66 could be used as an alternative binding agent of dgt devices for measuring drp in aqueous solutions in the present study uio 66 suspension was developed as the new liquid binding agent of dgt technique for the in situ measurement of drp in waters uptake capacity of uio 66 dgt for drp was evaluated and the influences of ph and ionic strength on the performance of uio 66 dgt were systematically investigated under laboratory conditions meanwhile field experiments were carried out by deployment of uio 66 dgt in a natural freshwater lake lake chaohu for in situ measuring drp at different time intervals finally the application of the developed uio 66 dgt was assessed in eight different sites across lake chaohu for 7 d to reveal the drp status of the whole lake 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials materials used in this study were detailed in the supporting information si text s1 2 2 synthesis and characterization of uio 66 uio 66 particles used in the present study were synthesized by a simple solvothermal method according to our previous study gu et al 2017 typically 56 0 mg of zrcl4 and 39 9 mg of bdc were mixed in 30 ml of dmf under magnetic stirring 137 4 μl of acetic acid was added to the above solution as modulator subsequently the mixture was transferred into a 50 ml teflon lined steel autoclave and placed in an oven at 120 c for 24 h after cooling down to room temperature the resultant solid product was isolated by centrifugation and washed several times with dmf after that these samples were activated in methanol for 3 d at 60 c in order to remove the trapped dmf molecules under drying overnight under vacuum condition at 60 c the samples were stored in a desiccator for further use the crystal phases of uio 66 were examined by x ray diffraction xrd philips x pert pro patterns of the powders the size and morphology of samples were characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem su8020 and transmission electron microscope tem fei tecnai g2 f20 the zeta potential was analyzed by a zetasizer3000hsa malvern analyzer 2 3 dgt assembly and deployment the component of dgt cell body was shown in fig s1 the dgt devices were assembled as described previously liu et al 2016 typically the binding phase solution was added into the container base with solution volume of 2 2 ml afterwards the silica rubber spacer was fixed onto the base and the diffusive membrane was placed on the top of the gasket at last the dgt cap was tightened securely to complete the assembly a purchased dialysis membrane of 35 0 3 μm thickness was used as diffusive layer as measured by an optical microscope before used the dialysis membrane was pretreated by boiling in the mix solution of 2 0 w v nahco3 and 1 0 mmol l 1 edta 2na for 10 min at ph 8 0 after a thoroughgoing rinse by excessive deionized water at 60 c the pretreated membranes were stored in the mix solution of deionized water and ethanol v v 1 1 at 4 c 2 4 analytical method and dgt concentration calculation concentration of dissolved and total p in synthetic solutions and lake water samples were directly analyzed by the molybdenum blue colorimetric method murphy and riley 1962 before analysis the drp captured by uio 66 dgt was eluted by 0 5 mol l 1 naoh for 8 h and neutralized by 2 0 mol l 1 h2so4 the mass m of drp in binding solution was calculated by eq 1 zhang and davison 1995 1 m c e v n a o h v u i o 66 v h 2 s o 4 f e where ce is the concentration of drp in eluent vnaoh is the volume of added naoh solution vuio 66 is the volume of binding agent 2 2 ml vh2so4 is the volume of h2so4 added into eluent and fe is the elution efficiency in this study fe of drp was obtained using different concentrations of naoh 0 01 1 mol l 1 as an eluent for a wide range of drp concentrations 0 1 10 mg l 1 the drp concentration measured by dgt cdgt was calculated by eq 2 2 c d g t m δ g d a t where δg d cm2 s 1 a and t represent the thickness of dialysis membrane 35 μm the diffusion coefficient of drp area of the sampling window of dgt devices and the deployment time respectively 2 5 diffusion coefficients measurement the diffusion coefficients d of drp across the dialysis membranes were determined by a specially designed diffusion cell according to the process reported previously bennett et al 2010 lucas et al 2012 the diffusion cell was constructed with two 400 ml perspex compartments each with an interconnecting 3 0 cm diameter opening a 3 0 cm diameter of dialysis membrane 35 μm thickness was placed on the opening to provide the mass transport between two compartments the source compartment labeled as a contained 1 0 mmol l 1 of kh2po4 in 400 ml of 10 mmol l 1 nano3 solution as the carrier solution the receptor compartment labeled as b was filled with 400 ml of 10 mmol l 1 nano3 solution both compartments were stirred continuously by magnetic stirrer samples were taken from both compartments and drp concentration was measured by the molybdenum blue colorimetric method at 15 min intervals up to 120 min the same experiments were also undertaken in different nano3 and na2so4 solution 0 01 100 mmol l 1 the d was calculated based on eq 3 3 d m δ g a c t where m δg a c and t represent the mass of phosphorus accumulated in the compartment b the thickness of dialysis membrane 35 μm the exposed area of the diffusive membrane 7 07 cm2 phosphorus concentration in the source compartment initial 31 mg p l 1 and the deployment time respectively 2 6 effect of deployment time on dgt uptake the accumulation of drp over time was tested by deploying a series of uio 66 dgt devices to a well stirred synthetic solution with 0 20 mg l 1 p and 10 mmol l 1 nano3 over periods of 5 d at ph 6 5 sufficient volume 24 l of the bulk solution was to maintain the negligible concentration depletion of drp by the dgt devices the same validation test was also undertaken in low drp concentration 0 02 mg p l 1 at a certain interval three dgt devices were withdrawn from the solution and eluted by 0 5 mol l 1 naoh the amounts of drp in the eluent were measured by molybdenum blue colorimetric method the mass of drp m accumulated in the uio 66 dgt from a known p concentration solution c by passing through a diffusive layer with the known area a and thickness δg over a deployment time t can be predicted by the dgt equation 4 4 m d a c t δ g 2 7 the binding properties of the uio 66 dgt to acquire the optimal loading of uio 66 used for the dgt technique the dgt devices with various concentrations of uio 66 solutions 0 10 0 20 0 50 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 mg ml 1 were deployed in a well stirred solution containing 0 20 mg l 1 p and 10 mmol l 1 nano3 at ph 6 5 for 24 h the capacity of the uio 66 dgt was estimated by deploying uio 66 dgt devices in 12 l of well stirred solutions with different kh2po4 concentrations 0 1 10 mg p l 1 for 24 h ph 6 5 10 mmol l 1 nano3 for effects of ph and ionic strength a number of dgt devices were immersed in 0 20 mg l 1 p solutions with a series of ph values 4 5 5 5 6 5 7 5 8 5 and 9 5 and ionic strengths 0 01 0 1 1 10 and 100 mmol l 1 as nano3 for 24 h the effects of potentially competing anions co3 2 and so4 2 with two different concentrations 10 or 100 mmol l 1 on the uptake of drp by the uio 66 dgt were investigated by deploying uio 66 dgt samplers for 24 h in continuously stirred solution additionally in order to eliminate the effect of the elevated ph caused by the addition of co3 2 on the performance of the uio 66 dgt ph of na2co3 solution was adjusted to be 8 0 using 0 1 mol l 1 hno3 or naoh 2 8 field deployment to test the applicability of the uio 66 dgt in wild fresh water dgt devices were used in a water microcosm taken from lake chaohu the fifth largest freshwater lake in china with an area of 760 km2 located in anhui province fresh water was collected on may 20 2017 from a severely polluted region of lake chaohu at 31 41 50 n 117 24 13 e the basic parameters of the lake water were listed in table s2 the dgt devices were deployed over a period of 0 67 h the drp concentrations of the received water were measured through the entire deployment to ensure the drp concentration was maintained and the d in the water of lake chaohu was calculated by eq 3 the accumulation of drp over time was also tested in lake chaohu in situ by deploying a series of uio 66 dgt devices to site 1 fig s2 30 cm beneath the water surface over 14 d at different intervals three dgt devices were withdrawn from water meanwhile lake water was also simultaneously grabbed filtered by 0 45 μm filter membranes and used to detect drp directly besides dgt devices were deployed at the eight field sites throughout the lake chaohu as displayed in fig s2 sites 1 to 4 were located in the west half lake while sites 5 to 8 were located in the east half lake close to the densely populated city at each site three uio 66 dgt devices were deployed 30 cm beneath the water surface for 7 d temperature drp ph and other details of water were measured three times during the deployment after deployment the dgt devices were taken off from water rinsed with deionized water and stored at 4 c before analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and structural characterization of uio 66 the morphology and particle size of the synthesized uio 66 were identified by fesem and tem image as shown in fig 1 a most of the as prepared uio 66 particles displayed a typical octahedral morphology with an average edge length of around 500 nm tem characterization further confirmed the octahedral morphology fig 1b furthermore the representative tem image of uio 66 and corresponding eds element mappings revealed that zirconium red zone oxygen green zone and carbon blue zone were homogeneously distributed throughout octahedral frameworks fig 1c f meanwhile the crystallographic structure of the synthesized uio 66 was confirmed by the xrd pattern fig 1g in which the main diffraction peaks matched well with the simulated patterns of uio 66 and no other peaks were observed these findings suggested the successful preparation of uio 66 particles the binding agent used for dgt devices must have fast and efficient adsorption capacity for the analytes to investigate the adsorption rate of p on uio 66 the adsorption experiments were conducted by immersing uio 66 in phosphate solution with a concentration of 15 mg p l 1 under magnetic stirring at ph 6 5 fig s3a as a consequence 85 of p was adsorbed by uio 66 at first 10 min and then the sorption equilibrium was achieved within around 60 min indicating a rapid uptake of p by uio 66 to obtain the maximum uptake capacities of p by uio 66 the adsorption isotherm experiment was carried out at the same conditions fig s3b the adsorption data could be fitted by langmuir model the fitting parameters were summarized in table s1 the saturated adsorption capacity of phosphate on uio 66 was calculated from the langmuir model to be 415 mg g 1 which was significantly greater than other prevalent zirconium containing adsorbents su et al 2015 wang et al 2016a in which the phosphate adsorption capacity on ce0 8zr0 2o2 nanoparticles and the hierarchical mesoporous zro2 sio2 nanofibrous membranes were 112 mg g 1 su et al 2015 and 43 8 mg g 1 wang et al 2016a respectively these findings highlighted the huge potential of uio 66 as binding agents for dgt devices effective elution was also required for the recovery of drp from the dgt binding agents after deployment li et al 2002 previous studies showed that naoh could effectively remove p from zirconium oxide ding et al 2010 thus the elution efficiency of drp from uio 66 was investigated by adding different concentrations of naoh solution as shown in fig s4 the elution efficiency fe increased with increasing naoh concentrations the fe reached 96 with 0 5 mol l 1 naoh and maintained stable with further increasing naoh concentrations to 1 0 mol l 1 taking into account the fact that high concentration base interfered with subsequent drp concentration analysis 0 5 mol l 1 naoh was selected to elute drp from uio 66 and fe of 0 96 was used for the calculation of drp mass accumulated in uio 66 3 2 diffusion coefficients of drp the diffusion coefficient d of drp was measured by diffusion cell fig 2 a showed the different accumulated mass of drp over time which suggested a linear uptake of drp by uio 66 r2 0 998 through the slope of the linear line d was calculated to be 1 55 0 02 10 7 cm2 s 1 which was lower than that in the synthetic polyacrylamide hydrogel of 7 39 10 6 cm2 s 1 zhang et al 1998 the possible reason could be attributed to the lower porosity structure and lower water content of dialysis membrane importantly the water content of the polyacrylamide hydrogel was about 95 whereas the corresponding value was 50 for dialysis membrane the d values were also measured in solutions with different ionic strengths i as a result the d values increased with increasing the ionic strengths in both nano3 and na2so4 solutions fig 2b consistent with the experimental results reported by chen and panther chen et al 2014b panther et al 2008 i e the d values of both cr vi through cellulose acetate dialysis membrane and as v through the negatively charged nafion membrane increased with the increase of ionic strengths as reported the increase in the d values with high ionic strength may be ascribed to a variation of the donnan potential between the diffusive layer and the external solution golmohamadi et al 2012 which altered the chemical partitioning of drp within the diffusive layer meanwhile the partition coefficients of anions increased with increasing ionic strengths due to progressive screening of the anionic sites in the diffusive layer as predicted by the boltzmann and poisson boltzmann equations fatin rouge et al 2003 similar donnan effects were also found in agarose and polyacrylamide hydrogels huang et al 2016b sangi et al 2002 in our case the d value of drp was highly dependent on the ionic strength in the investigated waters as well known the ionic strength can be determined according to eq 5 5 i 1 2 i 1 n c i z i 2 where ci is the molar concentration of ion i m mol l 1 zi is the charge number of that ion meanwhile the relationship between d and i could be calibrated based on the regression analysis in which an exponential curve d 2 69 10 7exp i 0 017 3 05 10 7 provided an excellent and highly significant fit to the data fig 2b r2 0 99 as a result the d values can be facilely deduced from the dependent relationship mentioned above once the ionic strength was identified in the investigated waters 3 3 optimization of uio 66 loading to explore the appropriate loading of uio 66 used as the binding agent the dgt devices with different uio 66 concentrations 0 1 4 0 mg ml 1 were arranged in a well stirred solution with 0 20 mg p l 1 for 24 h as seen from fig 3 the drp mass accumulated by the uio 66 dgt devices increased with the uio 66 loading rising from 0 1 to 1 0 mg ml 1 whereas the value reached a plateau with the uio 66 loading increasing up to 4 0 mg ml 1 for comparison the loading of uio 66 at high p concentration 2 0 mg l 1 was also examined as demonstrated in fig s6 the similar drp mass accumulated trend could be obtained that is 1 0 mg ml 1 of uio 66 was sufficient for the measurements of high p these results indicated that the accumulated drp mass was independent of uio 66 loading when its loading was more than 1 0 mg ml 1 which ascribed to the enhancement of high loading of uio 66 in capturing the drp diffusion into the dgt device and hindering its diffusion out nevertheless exorbitant uio 66 raised the cost of assembling dgt devices therefore 1 0 mg ml 1 of uio 66 was selected as the binding agent in the following measurements 3 4 validation of uio 66 dgt the uio 66 dgt was validated by assessing the relationship between measured mass of drp and deployment time fig 4 a depicted the drp mass accumulated by uio 66 dgt at different time intervals the accumulated drp mass increased linearly over 5 d r2 0 996 what is more cdgt calculated using eq 2 was in good agreement with the drp concentration in solution csol reflected by the measured to predicted ratios cdgt csol being 1 02 0 02 n 24 the same validation was also conducted at lower phosphate concentration of 0 02 mg p l 1 from fig 4b it could be seen that a linear uptake of drp by the uio 66 dgt was achieved within 5 d of the deployment time r2 0 997 combined with eq 2 the ratios of cdgt csol was calculated to be 0 98 0 03 n 15 suggesting the successful application of uio 66 dgt in both high and low phosphate concentration waters 3 5 the capacity of uio 66 dgt the binding agent might be saturated when the dgt device was used in environment matrixes with high drp concentration or for a long period of time therefore the uptake capacity of drp by the uio 66 dgt was investigated by deploying the uio 66 dgt devices in solutions with different drp concentration 0 10 10 mg p l 1 for 24 h the accumulated drp mass at different drp concentration was depicted in fig 5 a linear relationship was got with the drp concentration up to 5 mg p l 1 further increasing the drp concentration the accumulated mass of drp was less than that calculated by eq 4 clearly suggesting the binding capacity of uio 66 dgt mismatched with the dgt formula at this point thus the binding capacity of uio 66 dgt was estimated as 147 μg p or 20 8 μg p cm 2 which was about 4 times of the metsorb binding phase 40 μg p panther et al 2010 and 10 times of the commonly used ferrihydrite gel binding phase 2 μg p cm 2 zhang et al 1998 nevertheless this value was lower than the zro chelex mixed binding gel and zr oxide gel binding phase whose capacities was 90 μg p cm 2 xu et al 2013 and above 100 μg p cm 2 respectively ding et al 2010 the underlying reason behind the different binding capacities may be attributed to the amount of the binding agents in various dgt devices in our case the amount of uio 66 used in the liquid binding agent was very small 10 mg uio 66 particles dispersed into 10 ml of deionized water while zr oxide gel was got from the mixture of a weight of 1 8 g half dried amorphous zirconium hydroxide and 3 6 ml of gel solution ding et al 2010 in order to further evaluate the superiority of the developed uio 66 dgt zirconium oxide and iron oxide powder were dispersed in deionized water respectively and utilized as the liquid binding agents for dgt measurements of drp as displayed in fig s7 the mass of drp accumulated in uio 66 dgt agreed well with the predicted value however as for zro2 dgt or fe2o3 dgt the accumulated mass was much lower than the predicted mass at 3 24 h consequently the zro2 dgt and fe2o3 dgt significantly underestimated the drp concentration in waters these results suggested that uio 66 was a promising material as the liquid binding phase of dgt devices furthermore the capacity of uio 66 dgt used in the present study could be further extended by simply increasing the uio 66 dosage deployed in the dgt device besides the typical advantages of the conventional liquid binding phases such as excellent contacts between the binding layer and the diffusive layer a theoretically ideal mass transport good reproducibility a well defined reproducible diffusive layer the present liquid binding phase dgt technique possessed the additional characteristics associated with the low dosage of uio 66 binding phase and high uptake capacity towards phosphorus as well as preferable affinity towards the target drp species more significantly the present uio 66 binding phase can be compatible with the commercial membranes facilitating the future large scale application 3 6 effects of ph and ionic strength the variation of solution ph can affect the speciation of drp surface charges of uio 66 as well as the interaction between drp and binding agent thus the effect of ph on the performance of uio 66 dgt was studied which was evaluated by the ratios of cdgt csol fig 6 a depicted the cdgt csol ratios under ph ranging from 4 5 to 9 5 obviously there was a strong dependent relationship between the ratio of cdgt csol and solution ph in which the ratio was 1 0 when solution ph was 6 5 and then decreased significantly with ph increasing from 6 5 to 9 5 on the basis of the zero potentials of uio 66 shown in fig s5 the surface of uio 66 displayed positive charges at low ph facilitating the binding of negatively charged drp hpo4 2 h2po4 via electrostatic attraction with ph increasing to alkaline condition uio 66 was deprotonated and less capable of binding with negatively charged drp due to the strong coulomb repulsive interaction when ph was in the ranges of 6 5 8 5 the cdgt csol ratios were within the interval of 0 9 1 1 thus the optimum ph ranges of uio 66 dgt for trapping drp were 6 5 8 5 besides the effects of ionic strengths and some potentially interfering anions on the performance of uio 66 dgt were also studied as illustrated in fig 6b the accumulated drp mass increased from 0 9 to 13 0 μg at 24 h with varying nano3 concentrations from 0 01 to 100 mmol l 1 which was ascribed to the d values increasing with ionic strength fig 2b combining with the d values obtained at different ionic strengths cdgt was calculated according to eq 3 fig 6c showed that the cdgt csol ratios were all within the intervals of 0 9 1 1 confirming that the uio 66 dgt devices could reliably determine drp at different ionic strengths with rectified d since the sulfate so4 2 and carbonate ions co3 2 are commonly found in natural waters which might interfere with the determination of drp concentration the effects of so4 2 and co3 2 were assessed as displayed in fig s8 the accumulated drp mass increased with rising so4 2 and co3 2 concentrations from 10 to 100 mmol l 1 importantly at the same concentration of nano3 na2so4 and na2co3 the accumulated drp mass was in the sequence of na2so4 na2co3 nano3 which ascribed to the fact that the d values increased with increasing ionic strengths at ph 8 0 hco3 was the main species in carbonate solutions thus the ionic strength values were in the sequence of na2so4 na2co3 nano3 under the same concentrations based on the rectified d the cdgt csol ratios were plotted against the concentrations of no3 so4 2 and co3 2 in fig 6d obviously the determination of drp concentration was shown to be accurate 10 in the presence of so4 2 up to 100 mmol l 1 as for co3 2 the detection of drp was accurate at low concentration of 10 mmol l 1 which would be underestimated up to 20 in the presence of high co3 2 concentration 100 mmol l 1 this phenomenon was likely caused by competitive action between phosphate and carbonate for the identical sorption sites on uio 66 gu et al 2017 considering the fact that the concentration of carbonate at normal seawater ca 2 4 mmol l 1 zoccola et al 2015 was much less than 10 mmol l 1 the proposed uio 66 dgt was feasible for the accurate determination of drp in normal freshwater and seawater 3 7 field deployments the aforementioned laboratory results indicated that the uio 66 dgt was likely to be a robust tool for selectively measuring drp in situ in order to ensure the reliability of the uio 66 dgt in natural water the uio 66 dgt devices were deployed in the lake chaohu water firstly the d of drp was measured in the laboratory by deploying the uio 66 dgt devices in the collected lake chaohu water without any treatment in which drp concentration was determined to be 0 16 mg p l 1 as shown in fig 7 a the accumulated mass of drp by uio 66 dgt was linearly increased during a long period of deployment 67 h suggesting the potential of uio 66 dgt in natural waters the slope of the line was fitted to be 0 12 r2 0 996 accordingly combined with eq 3 the d of drp in lake chaohu water was calculated to be 8 67 0 11 10 8 cm2 s 1 which was less than that 1 55 0 02 10 7 cm2 s 1 in 10 mmol l 1 nano3 solution meanwhile the d value was significantly less than the measured value in water of 8 46 10 6 cm2 s 1 zhang et al 1998 that is the transport across the membrane was the rate limiting step therefore in our dgt measurements the formation of a diffusion boundary layer dbl at the membrane interface will usually have a very minor contribution to the overall mass transport this implied the thickness of the membrane could be used as δg in the dgt equation with no need for the further correction about dbl thickness the possible reason behind the decreased d of drp might be correlated with the little bio fouling of the dialysis membrane during the deployment period and the presence of organic compounds and other interfering ions in natural waters liu et al 2012 the validity of the uio 66 dgt for real samples analysis was evaluated by deploying uio 66 dgt devices at site 1 fig s2 in lake chaohu for 14 d as shown in fig 7b the accumulate drp mass increased linearly with the deployment time r2 0 996 combined with eq 2 cdgt was calculated at different deployment time as shown in fig 7c the cdgt csol ratios were all in the range of 0 9 1 1 indicating that uio 66 dgt could be used for in situ detection of drp in lake chaohu in order to assess the feasibility and reliability of the uio 66 dgt in different pollution level waters the deployments of uio 66 dgt devices were tested in various eight sites across lake chaohu for 7 d the distribution of the eight sites was displayed in fig s2 during the deployments of uio 66 dgt lake water was grabbed at day 1 4 and 7 filtered by 0 45 μm filter membranes and used to detect drp directly the average 0 45 μm filtered measurements obtained from grab samples csol and the accumulated drp mass by three separate uio 66 dgt samplers were given in table s3 furthermore based on the accumulated drp mass by uio 66 dgt the cdgt values at different deployment sites were calculated by eq 2 it was noteworthy that the accumulated drp mass by uio 66 dgt at the west half lake sites 1 4 was much high than that sites 5 8 in the east half lake consistent with the average drp concentrations of sequential multiple grab samplings despite various sites that is the uio 66 dgt can truly reflect the temporal and spatial diversification of drp across the whole lake water the underlying cause was ascribed to the fact that the former is close to the densely populated city in which much more anthropogenic events lead to more phosphorus emissions significantly as shown in table 1 the cdgt csol ratios of the eight sites were all in the ranges of 0 83 1 13 confirming the feasibility of uio 66 dgt for the detection of drp in natural water with different pollution levels further investigations were still needed for the deployment of uio 66 dgt at different waters 4 conclusion in the present study a hydrostable uio 66 was successfully fabricated by a simple one pot solvothermal method benefiting from its high affinity towards p uio 66 was innovatively applied as an efficient binding agent of dgt device for drp measurement the uio 66 dgt performance was validated in both high and low phosphate concentration waters in addition the diffusion coefficients of drp increased with rising ionic strengths from 0 01 to 100 mmol l 1 accompanied by the increase of accumulated drp mass by uio 66 dgt based on the rectified d the performance of uio 66 dgt was independent of ph and ionic strength field deployments of the uio 66 dgt validated the potential of this technique for in situ measurement of drp importantly good agreements were obtained between cdgt and csol in the lake water which indicated that uio 66 dgt was applicable to the detection of drp in the natural water with different pollution levels these findings paved a way

19245,in an effort to provide early warnings for the occurrence of eutrophication it is highly desirable to develop an accurate and efficient technique to ensure continuous monitoring of dissolved reactive phosphorus drp in the aquatic environment from the viewpoint of environmental management herein a new diffusive gradient in thin film dgt technique was developed and evaluated for in situ measurement of drp in waters in which zr based metal organic frameworks mofs uio 66 were utilized as aqueous binding agent abbreviated as uio 66 dgt as expected the uio 66 dgt demonstrated high uptake capacity towards phosphorus 20 8 μg p cm 2 meanwhile an excellent linearity between the accumulated drp mass and deployment time over 5 d r2 0 996 was obtained regardless of high or low phosphate solution in addition effective diffusion coefficients d of drp increased exponentially with increasing ionic strengths r2 0 99 based on the rectified d the performance of the uio 66 dgt was independent of solution ph 6 5 8 5 and ionic strengths ranging from 0 01 to 100 mmol l 1 furthermore field deployments of the uio 66 dgt were undertaken in a natural eutrophic lake lake chaohu china it was noteworthy that drp could be continually accumulated by the uio 66 dgt for more than 14 d and good agreements were obtained between the concentrations measured by dgt cdgt and those by ex situ chemical extraction method in solution csol as reflected by cdgt csol of 0 9 1 1 in situ determination of drp speciation was also carried out at different sites across lake chaohu overall this study contributed to a better constructing of liquid binding phase dgt for the measurement of drp in waters facilitating the widespread application of the uio 66 dgt as a routine monitoring technique and for large scale environmental analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords diffusive gradients in thin films dissolved reactive phosphorus metal organic frameworks uio 66 in situ measurement 1 introduction water eutrophication is expanding worldwide with increasing magnitude and frequency often resulting in the promotion of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in freshwaters baken et al 2015 fang et al 2018 smil 2003 both nitrogen n and phosphorus p are key factors to accelerate the process of eutrophication chen et al 2018a ding et al 2018a which may vary temporally across seasons geographically with regions and even spatially within a lake xu et al 2015 noteworthy among all species of phosphorus dissolved reactive phosphorus drp play the primary role in sustaining cyanobacterial blooms funes et al 2015 xu et al 2015 therefore the accurate measurement of drp speciation in waters is quite important for the early warning or recovering of eutrophic waters the traditional detection method is based on molybdenum blue spectrophotometry ion chromatography or inductively coupled plasma electrometer guo et al 2005 motomizu et al 1983 ogle et al 2004 before analysis water samples must suffer from several steps including the field sample collection storage transportation and purification which is time consuming and may cause some physical chemical and biological changes of the collected samples during the process moreover it is difficult to objectively reflect the actual distribution of phosphorus in waters thus it is highly desirable to develop an effective in situ sampling technique to accurately measure the concentration of drp in natural waters in order to alleviate the need for preservation and storage of samples it is well recognized that the diffusive gradient in thin film dgt technique as a promising tool for in situ sampling the labile fraction of analytes in waters developed by davison and coworkers in the early 1990s davlson and zhang 1994 zhang et al 1998 has attracted widespread attention in virtue of its possibility of selective sampling of the species as well as avoiding any changes in speciation and significant sample disturbance chen et al 2013 ding et al 2018b guan et al 2015 huynh et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 the primary dgt device was constructed of a thin hydrogel diffusive layer a hydrogel like binding layer and a protective filter membrane chen et al 2017 zhang and davison 1995 in which the dissolved analytes passed through the diffusion layer to the binding layer imbued with the specific binding agent with strong affinity toward the target analyte at a rate governed by fick s first law of diffusion ding et al 2015 it should be mentioned that the binding agents must have sufficiently high capacity to capture the target analytes and ensure the solute concentration to be zero at the boundary between the diffusion layer and the binding layer that is the measurements of different substances depended on the affinity of binding agents used in the dgt devices toward the target substances chen et al 2018b hence development of new binding agents has received increasing attention in recent years various hydrogel binding agents were successfully developed to measure various analytes e g chelex 100 resin for labile metals species wu et al 2015a speron thiol resin for total dissolved mercury docekalová and divis 2005 purolite a520e for nitrate huang et al 2016a and molecularly imprinted polymer for 4 chlorophenol dong et al 2014 concurrently several types of hydrogel binding agents including ferrihydrite titanium dioxide and half dried amorphous zirconium oxide have been extensively used to accumulate drp in aquatic and soil systems ding et al 2010 2013 panther et al 2010 wu et al 2015b zhang et al 1998 despite these huge advances associated with solid binding agents their applications usually suffered from some unavoidable drawbacks such as poor mechanical resistance poor reproducibility and poorly defined gel structure and etc as a result the key to address the above mentioned constraints was to develop novel binding agents for the trapping of drp to provide more reliable data in the past few years the aqueous binding agents received increasing attention due to a great deal of outstanding advantages such as facile for handing and massive production the excellent contact between the binding agent and diffusive layer a theoretically ideal mass transport and well defined reproducible diffusive layer fan et al 2013 rendering them ideal candidates for the binding agents of dgt recently several polymer based liquid binding phases such as poly 4 styrenesulfonate solution li et al 2003 polyquaternary ammonium salt chen et al 2014a and sodium polyacrylate fan et al 2009b have been developed in these studies dialysis membranes were used as diffusive layer to partition and retain the liquid binding phases li et al 2003 the traditional diffusive layer used in dgt was agarose cross linked polyacrylamide apa hydrogel which often interacted electrostatically with metals and adsorbed some compounds via its functional groups zhang and davison 1999 more recently another type of hydrogel agarose was increasingly used as diffusive gels benefiting from its feasibility to a wide range of inorganic and organic analytes wang et al 2016b nevertheless these gels were not suitable for the liquid binding phases because they had an open pore size of 5 μm wang et al 2016b in contrast taking into account a wide variety of pore sizes dialysis membranes could allow the passage of analytes and retain the liquid binding phases liu et al 2016 however only few liquid binding phases were found to be compatible with commercial membranes fan et al 2009a zhang et al 2018 because they often hindered the effective transport of target analytes hence it remains a valuable goal to develop new aqueous binding agents compatible well with various membrane pore structures for realizing the widespread use of such liquid type dgt devices as a new class of porous materials metal organic frameworks mofs can be constructed with high surface areas predictable structures and tunable pore sizes wang et al 2015 which can match with a wide variety of membrane pore structures benefiting from the multiple structure types excellent stability and intriguing properties zr based mofs was expected as one of the most promising mof materials for practical applications audu et al 2016 bai et al 2016 very recently we found that zr based mofs uio 66 presented high affinity towards p gu et al 2017 it was also verified that the zr o nodes in the mofs acted as specific anchors for the effective capture of p via the formation of zr o p bonds bui et al 2018 these precedents prompted us to further propose that uio 66 could be used as an alternative binding agent of dgt devices for measuring drp in aqueous solutions in the present study uio 66 suspension was developed as the new liquid binding agent of dgt technique for the in situ measurement of drp in waters uptake capacity of uio 66 dgt for drp was evaluated and the influences of ph and ionic strength on the performance of uio 66 dgt were systematically investigated under laboratory conditions meanwhile field experiments were carried out by deployment of uio 66 dgt in a natural freshwater lake lake chaohu for in situ measuring drp at different time intervals finally the application of the developed uio 66 dgt was assessed in eight different sites across lake chaohu for 7 d to reveal the drp status of the whole lake 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials materials used in this study were detailed in the supporting information si text s1 2 2 synthesis and characterization of uio 66 uio 66 particles used in the present study were synthesized by a simple solvothermal method according to our previous study gu et al 2017 typically 56 0 mg of zrcl4 and 39 9 mg of bdc were mixed in 30 ml of dmf under magnetic stirring 137 4 μl of acetic acid was added to the above solution as modulator subsequently the mixture was transferred into a 50 ml teflon lined steel autoclave and placed in an oven at 120 c for 24 h after cooling down to room temperature the resultant solid product was isolated by centrifugation and washed several times with dmf after that these samples were activated in methanol for 3 d at 60 c in order to remove the trapped dmf molecules under drying overnight under vacuum condition at 60 c the samples were stored in a desiccator for further use the crystal phases of uio 66 were examined by x ray diffraction xrd philips x pert pro patterns of the powders the size and morphology of samples were characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem su8020 and transmission electron microscope tem fei tecnai g2 f20 the zeta potential was analyzed by a zetasizer3000hsa malvern analyzer 2 3 dgt assembly and deployment the component of dgt cell body was shown in fig s1 the dgt devices were assembled as described previously liu et al 2016 typically the binding phase solution was added into the container base with solution volume of 2 2 ml afterwards the silica rubber spacer was fixed onto the base and the diffusive membrane was placed on the top of the gasket at last the dgt cap was tightened securely to complete the assembly a purchased dialysis membrane of 35 0 3 μm thickness was used as diffusive layer as measured by an optical microscope before used the dialysis membrane was pretreated by boiling in the mix solution of 2 0 w v nahco3 and 1 0 mmol l 1 edta 2na for 10 min at ph 8 0 after a thoroughgoing rinse by excessive deionized water at 60 c the pretreated membranes were stored in the mix solution of deionized water and ethanol v v 1 1 at 4 c 2 4 analytical method and dgt concentration calculation concentration of dissolved and total p in synthetic solutions and lake water samples were directly analyzed by the molybdenum blue colorimetric method murphy and riley 1962 before analysis the drp captured by uio 66 dgt was eluted by 0 5 mol l 1 naoh for 8 h and neutralized by 2 0 mol l 1 h2so4 the mass m of drp in binding solution was calculated by eq 1 zhang and davison 1995 1 m c e v n a o h v u i o 66 v h 2 s o 4 f e where ce is the concentration of drp in eluent vnaoh is the volume of added naoh solution vuio 66 is the volume of binding agent 2 2 ml vh2so4 is the volume of h2so4 added into eluent and fe is the elution efficiency in this study fe of drp was obtained using different concentrations of naoh 0 01 1 mol l 1 as an eluent for a wide range of drp concentrations 0 1 10 mg l 1 the drp concentration measured by dgt cdgt was calculated by eq 2 2 c d g t m δ g d a t where δg d cm2 s 1 a and t represent the thickness of dialysis membrane 35 μm the diffusion coefficient of drp area of the sampling window of dgt devices and the deployment time respectively 2 5 diffusion coefficients measurement the diffusion coefficients d of drp across the dialysis membranes were determined by a specially designed diffusion cell according to the process reported previously bennett et al 2010 lucas et al 2012 the diffusion cell was constructed with two 400 ml perspex compartments each with an interconnecting 3 0 cm diameter opening a 3 0 cm diameter of dialysis membrane 35 μm thickness was placed on the opening to provide the mass transport between two compartments the source compartment labeled as a contained 1 0 mmol l 1 of kh2po4 in 400 ml of 10 mmol l 1 nano3 solution as the carrier solution the receptor compartment labeled as b was filled with 400 ml of 10 mmol l 1 nano3 solution both compartments were stirred continuously by magnetic stirrer samples were taken from both compartments and drp concentration was measured by the molybdenum blue colorimetric method at 15 min intervals up to 120 min the same experiments were also undertaken in different nano3 and na2so4 solution 0 01 100 mmol l 1 the d was calculated based on eq 3 3 d m δ g a c t where m δg a c and t represent the mass of phosphorus accumulated in the compartment b the thickness of dialysis membrane 35 μm the exposed area of the diffusive membrane 7 07 cm2 phosphorus concentration in the source compartment initial 31 mg p l 1 and the deployment time respectively 2 6 effect of deployment time on dgt uptake the accumulation of drp over time was tested by deploying a series of uio 66 dgt devices to a well stirred synthetic solution with 0 20 mg l 1 p and 10 mmol l 1 nano3 over periods of 5 d at ph 6 5 sufficient volume 24 l of the bulk solution was to maintain the negligible concentration depletion of drp by the dgt devices the same validation test was also undertaken in low drp concentration 0 02 mg p l 1 at a certain interval three dgt devices were withdrawn from the solution and eluted by 0 5 mol l 1 naoh the amounts of drp in the eluent were measured by molybdenum blue colorimetric method the mass of drp m accumulated in the uio 66 dgt from a known p concentration solution c by passing through a diffusive layer with the known area a and thickness δg over a deployment time t can be predicted by the dgt equation 4 4 m d a c t δ g 2 7 the binding properties of the uio 66 dgt to acquire the optimal loading of uio 66 used for the dgt technique the dgt devices with various concentrations of uio 66 solutions 0 10 0 20 0 50 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 mg ml 1 were deployed in a well stirred solution containing 0 20 mg l 1 p and 10 mmol l 1 nano3 at ph 6 5 for 24 h the capacity of the uio 66 dgt was estimated by deploying uio 66 dgt devices in 12 l of well stirred solutions with different kh2po4 concentrations 0 1 10 mg p l 1 for 24 h ph 6 5 10 mmol l 1 nano3 for effects of ph and ionic strength a number of dgt devices were immersed in 0 20 mg l 1 p solutions with a series of ph values 4 5 5 5 6 5 7 5 8 5 and 9 5 and ionic strengths 0 01 0 1 1 10 and 100 mmol l 1 as nano3 for 24 h the effects of potentially competing anions co3 2 and so4 2 with two different concentrations 10 or 100 mmol l 1 on the uptake of drp by the uio 66 dgt were investigated by deploying uio 66 dgt samplers for 24 h in continuously stirred solution additionally in order to eliminate the effect of the elevated ph caused by the addition of co3 2 on the performance of the uio 66 dgt ph of na2co3 solution was adjusted to be 8 0 using 0 1 mol l 1 hno3 or naoh 2 8 field deployment to test the applicability of the uio 66 dgt in wild fresh water dgt devices were used in a water microcosm taken from lake chaohu the fifth largest freshwater lake in china with an area of 760 km2 located in anhui province fresh water was collected on may 20 2017 from a severely polluted region of lake chaohu at 31 41 50 n 117 24 13 e the basic parameters of the lake water were listed in table s2 the dgt devices were deployed over a period of 0 67 h the drp concentrations of the received water were measured through the entire deployment to ensure the drp concentration was maintained and the d in the water of lake chaohu was calculated by eq 3 the accumulation of drp over time was also tested in lake chaohu in situ by deploying a series of uio 66 dgt devices to site 1 fig s2 30 cm beneath the water surface over 14 d at different intervals three dgt devices were withdrawn from water meanwhile lake water was also simultaneously grabbed filtered by 0 45 μm filter membranes and used to detect drp directly besides dgt devices were deployed at the eight field sites throughout the lake chaohu as displayed in fig s2 sites 1 to 4 were located in the west half lake while sites 5 to 8 were located in the east half lake close to the densely populated city at each site three uio 66 dgt devices were deployed 30 cm beneath the water surface for 7 d temperature drp ph and other details of water were measured three times during the deployment after deployment the dgt devices were taken off from water rinsed with deionized water and stored at 4 c before analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and structural characterization of uio 66 the morphology and particle size of the synthesized uio 66 were identified by fesem and tem image as shown in fig 1 a most of the as prepared uio 66 particles displayed a typical octahedral morphology with an average edge length of around 500 nm tem characterization further confirmed the octahedral morphology fig 1b furthermore the representative tem image of uio 66 and corresponding eds element mappings revealed that zirconium red zone oxygen green zone and carbon blue zone were homogeneously distributed throughout octahedral frameworks fig 1c f meanwhile the crystallographic structure of the synthesized uio 66 was confirmed by the xrd pattern fig 1g in which the main diffraction peaks matched well with the simulated patterns of uio 66 and no other peaks were observed these findings suggested the successful preparation of uio 66 particles the binding agent used for dgt devices must have fast and efficient adsorption capacity for the analytes to investigate the adsorption rate of p on uio 66 the adsorption experiments were conducted by immersing uio 66 in phosphate solution with a concentration of 15 mg p l 1 under magnetic stirring at ph 6 5 fig s3a as a consequence 85 of p was adsorbed by uio 66 at first 10 min and then the sorption equilibrium was achieved within around 60 min indicating a rapid uptake of p by uio 66 to obtain the maximum uptake capacities of p by uio 66 the adsorption isotherm experiment was carried out at the same conditions fig s3b the adsorption data could be fitted by langmuir model the fitting parameters were summarized in table s1 the saturated adsorption capacity of phosphate on uio 66 was calculated from the langmuir model to be 415 mg g 1 which was significantly greater than other prevalent zirconium containing adsorbents su et al 2015 wang et al 2016a in which the phosphate adsorption capacity on ce0 8zr0 2o2 nanoparticles and the hierarchical mesoporous zro2 sio2 nanofibrous membranes were 112 mg g 1 su et al 2015 and 43 8 mg g 1 wang et al 2016a respectively these findings highlighted the huge potential of uio 66 as binding agents for dgt devices effective elution was also required for the recovery of drp from the dgt binding agents after deployment li et al 2002 previous studies showed that naoh could effectively remove p from zirconium oxide ding et al 2010 thus the elution efficiency of drp from uio 66 was investigated by adding different concentrations of naoh solution as shown in fig s4 the elution efficiency fe increased with increasing naoh concentrations the fe reached 96 with 0 5 mol l 1 naoh and maintained stable with further increasing naoh concentrations to 1 0 mol l 1 taking into account the fact that high concentration base interfered with subsequent drp concentration analysis 0 5 mol l 1 naoh was selected to elute drp from uio 66 and fe of 0 96 was used for the calculation of drp mass accumulated in uio 66 3 2 diffusion coefficients of drp the diffusion coefficient d of drp was measured by diffusion cell fig 2 a showed the different accumulated mass of drp over time which suggested a linear uptake of drp by uio 66 r2 0 998 through the slope of the linear line d was calculated to be 1 55 0 02 10 7 cm2 s 1 which was lower than that in the synthetic polyacrylamide hydrogel of 7 39 10 6 cm2 s 1 zhang et al 1998 the possible reason could be attributed to the lower porosity structure and lower water content of dialysis membrane importantly the water content of the polyacrylamide hydrogel was about 95 whereas the corresponding value was 50 for dialysis membrane the d values were also measured in solutions with different ionic strengths i as a result the d values increased with increasing the ionic strengths in both nano3 and na2so4 solutions fig 2b consistent with the experimental results reported by chen and panther chen et al 2014b panther et al 2008 i e the d values of both cr vi through cellulose acetate dialysis membrane and as v through the negatively charged nafion membrane increased with the increase of ionic strengths as reported the increase in the d values with high ionic strength may be ascribed to a variation of the donnan potential between the diffusive layer and the external solution golmohamadi et al 2012 which altered the chemical partitioning of drp within the diffusive layer meanwhile the partition coefficients of anions increased with increasing ionic strengths due to progressive screening of the anionic sites in the diffusive layer as predicted by the boltzmann and poisson boltzmann equations fatin rouge et al 2003 similar donnan effects were also found in agarose and polyacrylamide hydrogels huang et al 2016b sangi et al 2002 in our case the d value of drp was highly dependent on the ionic strength in the investigated waters as well known the ionic strength can be determined according to eq 5 5 i 1 2 i 1 n c i z i 2 where ci is the molar concentration of ion i m mol l 1 zi is the charge number of that ion meanwhile the relationship between d and i could be calibrated based on the regression analysis in which an exponential curve d 2 69 10 7exp i 0 017 3 05 10 7 provided an excellent and highly significant fit to the data fig 2b r2 0 99 as a result the d values can be facilely deduced from the dependent relationship mentioned above once the ionic strength was identified in the investigated waters 3 3 optimization of uio 66 loading to explore the appropriate loading of uio 66 used as the binding agent the dgt devices with different uio 66 concentrations 0 1 4 0 mg ml 1 were arranged in a well stirred solution with 0 20 mg p l 1 for 24 h as seen from fig 3 the drp mass accumulated by the uio 66 dgt devices increased with the uio 66 loading rising from 0 1 to 1 0 mg ml 1 whereas the value reached a plateau with the uio 66 loading increasing up to 4 0 mg ml 1 for comparison the loading of uio 66 at high p concentration 2 0 mg l 1 was also examined as demonstrated in fig s6 the similar drp mass accumulated trend could be obtained that is 1 0 mg ml 1 of uio 66 was sufficient for the measurements of high p these results indicated that the accumulated drp mass was independent of uio 66 loading when its loading was more than 1 0 mg ml 1 which ascribed to the enhancement of high loading of uio 66 in capturing the drp diffusion into the dgt device and hindering its diffusion out nevertheless exorbitant uio 66 raised the cost of assembling dgt devices therefore 1 0 mg ml 1 of uio 66 was selected as the binding agent in the following measurements 3 4 validation of uio 66 dgt the uio 66 dgt was validated by assessing the relationship between measured mass of drp and deployment time fig 4 a depicted the drp mass accumulated by uio 66 dgt at different time intervals the accumulated drp mass increased linearly over 5 d r2 0 996 what is more cdgt calculated using eq 2 was in good agreement with the drp concentration in solution csol reflected by the measured to predicted ratios cdgt csol being 1 02 0 02 n 24 the same validation was also conducted at lower phosphate concentration of 0 02 mg p l 1 from fig 4b it could be seen that a linear uptake of drp by the uio 66 dgt was achieved within 5 d of the deployment time r2 0 997 combined with eq 2 the ratios of cdgt csol was calculated to be 0 98 0 03 n 15 suggesting the successful application of uio 66 dgt in both high and low phosphate concentration waters 3 5 the capacity of uio 66 dgt the binding agent might be saturated when the dgt device was used in environment matrixes with high drp concentration or for a long period of time therefore the uptake capacity of drp by the uio 66 dgt was investigated by deploying the uio 66 dgt devices in solutions with different drp concentration 0 10 10 mg p l 1 for 24 h the accumulated drp mass at different drp concentration was depicted in fig 5 a linear relationship was got with the drp concentration up to 5 mg p l 1 further increasing the drp concentration the accumulated mass of drp was less than that calculated by eq 4 clearly suggesting the binding capacity of uio 66 dgt mismatched with the dgt formula at this point thus the binding capacity of uio 66 dgt was estimated as 147 μg p or 20 8 μg p cm 2 which was about 4 times of the metsorb binding phase 40 μg p panther et al 2010 and 10 times of the commonly used ferrihydrite gel binding phase 2 μg p cm 2 zhang et al 1998 nevertheless this value was lower than the zro chelex mixed binding gel and zr oxide gel binding phase whose capacities was 90 μg p cm 2 xu et al 2013 and above 100 μg p cm 2 respectively ding et al 2010 the underlying reason behind the different binding capacities may be attributed to the amount of the binding agents in various dgt devices in our case the amount of uio 66 used in the liquid binding agent was very small 10 mg uio 66 particles dispersed into 10 ml of deionized water while zr oxide gel was got from the mixture of a weight of 1 8 g half dried amorphous zirconium hydroxide and 3 6 ml of gel solution ding et al 2010 in order to further evaluate the superiority of the developed uio 66 dgt zirconium oxide and iron oxide powder were dispersed in deionized water respectively and utilized as the liquid binding agents for dgt measurements of drp as displayed in fig s7 the mass of drp accumulated in uio 66 dgt agreed well with the predicted value however as for zro2 dgt or fe2o3 dgt the accumulated mass was much lower than the predicted mass at 3 24 h consequently the zro2 dgt and fe2o3 dgt significantly underestimated the drp concentration in waters these results suggested that uio 66 was a promising material as the liquid binding phase of dgt devices furthermore the capacity of uio 66 dgt used in the present study could be further extended by simply increasing the uio 66 dosage deployed in the dgt device besides the typical advantages of the conventional liquid binding phases such as excellent contacts between the binding layer and the diffusive layer a theoretically ideal mass transport good reproducibility a well defined reproducible diffusive layer the present liquid binding phase dgt technique possessed the additional characteristics associated with the low dosage of uio 66 binding phase and high uptake capacity towards phosphorus as well as preferable affinity towards the target drp species more significantly the present uio 66 binding phase can be compatible with the commercial membranes facilitating the future large scale application 3 6 effects of ph and ionic strength the variation of solution ph can affect the speciation of drp surface charges of uio 66 as well as the interaction between drp and binding agent thus the effect of ph on the performance of uio 66 dgt was studied which was evaluated by the ratios of cdgt csol fig 6 a depicted the cdgt csol ratios under ph ranging from 4 5 to 9 5 obviously there was a strong dependent relationship between the ratio of cdgt csol and solution ph in which the ratio was 1 0 when solution ph was 6 5 and then decreased significantly with ph increasing from 6 5 to 9 5 on the basis of the zero potentials of uio 66 shown in fig s5 the surface of uio 66 displayed positive charges at low ph facilitating the binding of negatively charged drp hpo4 2 h2po4 via electrostatic attraction with ph increasing to alkaline condition uio 66 was deprotonated and less capable of binding with negatively charged drp due to the strong coulomb repulsive interaction when ph was in the ranges of 6 5 8 5 the cdgt csol ratios were within the interval of 0 9 1 1 thus the optimum ph ranges of uio 66 dgt for trapping drp were 6 5 8 5 besides the effects of ionic strengths and some potentially interfering anions on the performance of uio 66 dgt were also studied as illustrated in fig 6b the accumulated drp mass increased from 0 9 to 13 0 μg at 24 h with varying nano3 concentrations from 0 01 to 100 mmol l 1 which was ascribed to the d values increasing with ionic strength fig 2b combining with the d values obtained at different ionic strengths cdgt was calculated according to eq 3 fig 6c showed that the cdgt csol ratios were all within the intervals of 0 9 1 1 confirming that the uio 66 dgt devices could reliably determine drp at different ionic strengths with rectified d since the sulfate so4 2 and carbonate ions co3 2 are commonly found in natural waters which might interfere with the determination of drp concentration the effects of so4 2 and co3 2 were assessed as displayed in fig s8 the accumulated drp mass increased with rising so4 2 and co3 2 concentrations from 10 to 100 mmol l 1 importantly at the same concentration of nano3 na2so4 and na2co3 the accumulated drp mass was in the sequence of na2so4 na2co3 nano3 which ascribed to the fact that the d values increased with increasing ionic strengths at ph 8 0 hco3 was the main species in carbonate solutions thus the ionic strength values were in the sequence of na2so4 na2co3 nano3 under the same concentrations based on the rectified d the cdgt csol ratios were plotted against the concentrations of no3 so4 2 and co3 2 in fig 6d obviously the determination of drp concentration was shown to be accurate 10 in the presence of so4 2 up to 100 mmol l 1 as for co3 2 the detection of drp was accurate at low concentration of 10 mmol l 1 which would be underestimated up to 20 in the presence of high co3 2 concentration 100 mmol l 1 this phenomenon was likely caused by competitive action between phosphate and carbonate for the identical sorption sites on uio 66 gu et al 2017 considering the fact that the concentration of carbonate at normal seawater ca 2 4 mmol l 1 zoccola et al 2015 was much less than 10 mmol l 1 the proposed uio 66 dgt was feasible for the accurate determination of drp in normal freshwater and seawater 3 7 field deployments the aforementioned laboratory results indicated that the uio 66 dgt was likely to be a robust tool for selectively measuring drp in situ in order to ensure the reliability of the uio 66 dgt in natural water the uio 66 dgt devices were deployed in the lake chaohu water firstly the d of drp was measured in the laboratory by deploying the uio 66 dgt devices in the collected lake chaohu water without any treatment in which drp concentration was determined to be 0 16 mg p l 1 as shown in fig 7 a the accumulated mass of drp by uio 66 dgt was linearly increased during a long period of deployment 67 h suggesting the potential of uio 66 dgt in natural waters the slope of the line was fitted to be 0 12 r2 0 996 accordingly combined with eq 3 the d of drp in lake chaohu water was calculated to be 8 67 0 11 10 8 cm2 s 1 which was less than that 1 55 0 02 10 7 cm2 s 1 in 10 mmol l 1 nano3 solution meanwhile the d value was significantly less than the measured value in water of 8 46 10 6 cm2 s 1 zhang et al 1998 that is the transport across the membrane was the rate limiting step therefore in our dgt measurements the formation of a diffusion boundary layer dbl at the membrane interface will usually have a very minor contribution to the overall mass transport this implied the thickness of the membrane could be used as δg in the dgt equation with no need for the further correction about dbl thickness the possible reason behind the decreased d of drp might be correlated with the little bio fouling of the dialysis membrane during the deployment period and the presence of organic compounds and other interfering ions in natural waters liu et al 2012 the validity of the uio 66 dgt for real samples analysis was evaluated by deploying uio 66 dgt devices at site 1 fig s2 in lake chaohu for 14 d as shown in fig 7b the accumulate drp mass increased linearly with the deployment time r2 0 996 combined with eq 2 cdgt was calculated at different deployment time as shown in fig 7c the cdgt csol ratios were all in the range of 0 9 1 1 indicating that uio 66 dgt could be used for in situ detection of drp in lake chaohu in order to assess the feasibility and reliability of the uio 66 dgt in different pollution level waters the deployments of uio 66 dgt devices were tested in various eight sites across lake chaohu for 7 d the distribution of the eight sites was displayed in fig s2 during the deployments of uio 66 dgt lake water was grabbed at day 1 4 and 7 filtered by 0 45 μm filter membranes and used to detect drp directly the average 0 45 μm filtered measurements obtained from grab samples csol and the accumulated drp mass by three separate uio 66 dgt samplers were given in table s3 furthermore based on the accumulated drp mass by uio 66 dgt the cdgt values at different deployment sites were calculated by eq 2 it was noteworthy that the accumulated drp mass by uio 66 dgt at the west half lake sites 1 4 was much high than that sites 5 8 in the east half lake consistent with the average drp concentrations of sequential multiple grab samplings despite various sites that is the uio 66 dgt can truly reflect the temporal and spatial diversification of drp across the whole lake water the underlying cause was ascribed to the fact that the former is close to the densely populated city in which much more anthropogenic events lead to more phosphorus emissions significantly as shown in table 1 the cdgt csol ratios of the eight sites were all in the ranges of 0 83 1 13 confirming the feasibility of uio 66 dgt for the detection of drp in natural water with different pollution levels further investigations were still needed for the deployment of uio 66 dgt at different waters 4 conclusion in the present study a hydrostable uio 66 was successfully fabricated by a simple one pot solvothermal method benefiting from its high affinity towards p uio 66 was innovatively applied as an efficient binding agent of dgt device for drp measurement the uio 66 dgt performance was validated in both high and low phosphate concentration waters in addition the diffusion coefficients of drp increased with rising ionic strengths from 0 01 to 100 mmol l 1 accompanied by the increase of accumulated drp mass by uio 66 dgt based on the rectified d the performance of uio 66 dgt was independent of ph and ionic strength field deployments of the uio 66 dgt validated the potential of this technique for in situ measurement of drp importantly good agreements were obtained between cdgt and csol in the lake water which indicated that uio 66 dgt was applicable to the detection of drp in the natural water with different pollution levels these findings paved a way for developing new aqueous binding agents for dgt devices acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national key r d program of china 2017yfa0207202 the national natural science

19246,herein we proposed a new catalytic oxidation system i e iron iii tetraamidomacrocyclic ligand feiii taml mediated activation of peroxymonosulfate pms for highly efficient organic degradation using p chlorophenol 4 cp as a model one pms feiii taml is capable of degrading 4 cp completely in 9 min at the initial 4 cp of 50 μm and ph 7 whereas the recently explored system h2o2 feiii taml could only result in 22 4 cp removal in 20 min under otherwise identical conditions more attractively inorganic anions i e cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 exhibited insignificant effect on 4 cp degradation and the negative effect of natural organic matters nom on the degradation of 4 cp in pms feiii taml is much weaker than the sulfate radical based oxidation process pms co2 combined with in situ xanes spectra uv visible spectra electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra and radical quenching experiments high valent iron oxo complex feiv o taml instead of singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide radical o2 sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals ho was the key active species responsible for 4 cp degradation the formation rate k i and consumption rate k ii of the feiv o taml in pms feiii taml were ph dependent in the range of 6 0 11 5 as expected increasing the feiii taml and pms dosage resulted in a higher steady state concentration of feiv o taml and enhanced the 4 cp degradation accordingly in addition the oxidation capacity of pms was almost totally utilized in pms feiii taml for 4 cp oxidation due to the two electron abstraction from 4 cp by one pms we believe this study will shed new light on effective pms activation by fe ligand complexes to efficiently degrade organic contaminants via nonradical pathway graphical abstract image 1 keywords iron iii tetraamidomacrocyclic ligand peroxymonosulfate high valent iron oxo complex catalytic oxidation nonradical pathway 1 introduction the ligand complexed fe at high oxidation states have attracted enormous interest in both research and application in degradation of aqueous organic pollutants liu et al 2018 su et al 2018 particularly the n donor ligand complexed fe i e non heme iron has been developed and successfully used to produce high valent iron oxo complexes bryliakov and talsi 2014 canals et al 2013 sorokin 2013 a classical case is feiii tetraamidomacrocyclic ligands feiii tamls developed to simulate the peroxidase and cytochrome p450 enzymes kundu et al 2015b feiii taml activators are also regarded as green and efficient catalysts for h2o2 oxidation su et al 2018 for instance feiii taml activators of dosage as low as 0 1 10 μm brought about the rate constants of h2o2 activation as high as 104 m 1s 1 under the optimal conditions sen gupta et al 2002 such outstanding reactivity make feiii tamls ideal candidates in oxidative degradation of phenols wang et al 2017a pesticides tang et al 2016 estrogens shappell et al 2008 dyes warner et al 2015 pharmaceutical ingredients shen et al 2011 and even explosives kundu et al 2013 however their catalytic activity toward h2o2 is strongly ph dependent with the optimal ph at 10 ghosh et al 2008 at circumneutral phs where most contaminated waters fall their reactivity significantly dropped down for instance nearly 100 degradation of reactive black 15 was observed at ph 10 after 15 min in h2o2 feiii taml whereas only 20 decolorization was realized at neutral phs chahbane et al 2007 therefore more efforts are urgently required to improve the catalytic efficiency of feiii taml activators for their application at circumneutral phs peroxymonosulfate pms also known as oxone is a derivative of h2o2 where one hydrogen atom is replaced by a sulfonate group ghanbari and moradi 2017 nowadays pms has been extensively investigated for catalytic degradation of organic contaminants of concern chen et al 2018 feng et al 2017 gong et al 2018 in general sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical ho are produced when the peroxide bond o o of pms is homolytically cleaved as catalyzed by transition metals zou et al 2013 metal oxide duan et al 2018 and ultraviolet uv irradiation guan et al 2011 in addition pms could be catalyzed by benzoquinone zhou et al 2015 phenols zhou et al 2017 and n doped graphene liang et al 2017 to produce singlet oxygen 1o2 which is a nonradical reactive oxygen species ros of electrophilic nature and prefers to oxidize pollutants with electron rich functional groups lee et al 2011 another nonradical pathway based on electron transfer from organic substrates to pms mediated by catalysts i e carbon nanotubes cnts yun et al 2018a modification nanodiamonds yun et al 2018b and noble metals ahn et al 2016 have also been discovered generally pms is easy to be activated over h2o2 in both radical and nonradical pathway due to its asymmetric structure ho oso3 for instance pms exhibited much higher reactivity than h2o2 for atrazine degradation via reactive radicals in the presence of magnetic porous copper ferrite cufe2o4 guan et al 2013 as for nonradical activation process it has reported that carbonized polypyrrole with graphitic n exhibited outstanding pms activation for selective degradation of phenol whereas negligible phenol degradation was observed for h2o2 hu et al 2017 recently iron porphyrin and phthalocyanine complexes were reported to activate pms for contaminant degradation via high valent iron oxo complexes chen et al 2017 jiang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 for example günay and cimen observed that feiv o pts was produced for 2 4 6 trichloropenol tcp degradation in the presence of fe porphyrin tetrasulfonate feiiipts gunay and cimen 2017 moreover the iron complexes usually exhibit high pms catalytic efficiency over a wide ph range light stimulated iron ii hexadecachlorophthalocyanine feiipccl16 could effectively activate pms at ph 5 9 to generate powerful feiv o intermediate for carbamazepine oxidation wu et al 2017 except for the iron complexes mentioned above our recent study found that fe n moieties fixated in the framework of graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 could activate pms to produce high valent iron oxo species which exhibited efficient and selective degradation toward p chlorophenol 4 cp li et al 2018 inspired by the above studies we speculate that feiii tamls possibly activate pms to generate high valent iron oxo complex over a wide ph range however to the best of our knowledge such pms activation process has never been reported yet the main objective of this study was to investigate the catalytic degradation of the pms feiii taml system by using 4 cp as a model compound effects of ph feiii taml and pms dosage on the kinetics of 4 cp degradation were examined and the underlying mechanism was systematically probed in addition the effect of coexisting anions and natural organic matters noms on 4 cp degradation was elucidated and the stoichiometric efficiency of pms was considered 2 experimental 2 1 reagents and

nitroblue tetrazolium nbt were obtained from sigma aldrich shanghai the prototype feiii taml activator its molecular structure shown in fig s1 was purchased from greenox catalysts inc mellon institute pittsburgh pa usa due to the commercial unavailability of taml it was obtained by adjusting the ph of feiii taml stock solution to 2 with hcl and stood for 24 h before fe iii removal via precipitation ghosh et al 2003 α mno2 and cufe2o4 were synthesized according to previous studies saputra et al 2013 zhang et al 2013b the sample of natural organic matter nom was obtained from international humic substances society ihss all the other chemicals were of analytical grade or more pure and used without further purification deionized di water with resistivity of 18 2 mω cm was used throughout the experiments stock solutions of feiii taml pms and h2o2 were freshly prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of the reagents in di water the concentration of feiii taml stock solution was measured by the uv visible spectrophotometer uv 2700 shimadzu co japan using the molar absorption coefficients of 6600 m 1 cm 1 at 366 nm wang et al 2017a 2 2 experimental procedures degradation kinetic experiments were conducted in 100 ml glass bottles in 20 c water bath under magnetic stirring first preset volumes of stock solutions containing target organic compounds i e 4 cp and oxidants i e pms and h2o2 were added to the 10 mm phosphate buffered solution and the substrates i e cl nom was added when necessary the ph values were quickly adjusted by sodium hydroxide or perchloric acid then the experiments were triggered by adding desired dosage of catalyst i e feiii taml and co2 during the experiments ph was kept at a preset value within a deviation 0 2 samples 0 7 ml were withdrawn at different intervals from the reactor and 0 1 ml na2so3 0 1 m was added to quench the reaction before analysis all kinetic experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate and the average values with standard deviations were presented fe k edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectra were collected at the 1w2b beamline of beijing synchrotron radiation facility beijing china at room temperature before analysis the spectra was calibrated by setting the maximum of the first derivative of fe foil spectrum to 7112 ev the xanes spectra of feiii taml and pms feiii taml were collected in fluorescence mode the spectrum of pms feiii taml was collected in an in situ reactor containing pms 4 0 mm ph 7 and feiii taml 2 mm after 5 min reaction zhang et al 2013a all the xanes spectra were

oxidation products were determined using automatic scanning uv visible spectrophotometer uv 2700 shimadzu co japan total organic carbon toc was identified by toc v cpn analyzer shimadzu japan the pms and h2o2 concentration was measured by the spectrophotometric method proposed elsewhere liang et al 2008 sellers 1980 superoxide radicals o2 were examined by nbt method bielski et al 1980 so4 ho and 1o2 were detected employing electron paramagnetic resonance epr emx 10 12 bruker germany spectra with 50 0 mm of dmpo and temp as the spin trapping agent respectively liang et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 feiii taml mediated catalytic activation of pms for organics degradation to preliminarily probe the catalytic reactivity of the pms feiii taml system the oxidation of different organic pollutants was investigated as shown in fig 1 a complete degradation of 4 cp and bpa was observed whereas less than 12 nb was degraded in 20 min atz and phba were moderately removed with the efficiency of 50 and 67 respectively the above results suggested that the pms feiii taml system could degraded various organic pollutants with widely varying efficiencies the catalytic efficiency of the pms feiii taml system was further investigated by comparing with other oxidation systems for 4 cp degradation as seen in fig 2 negligible 4 cp degradation occurred in 20 min by feiii taml only and pms taml at ph 7 while 3 of 4 cp was reduced by pms only such low removal of 4 cp by pms was possibly attributed to the formation of singlet oxygen 1o2 via the slow self decomposition of pms 0 2 m 1s 1 zhou et al 2015 on the contrary pms feiii taml exhibited highly efficient degradation of 4 cp where 50 μm of 4 cp initially underwent a complete degradation in 9 min however only 22 of 4 cp was removed in h2o2 feiii taml which has been extensively investigated to degrade various organic pollutants kundu et al 2013 tang et al 2016 wang et al 2017a obviously the 4 cp degradation in pms feiii taml was much faster than in h2o2 feiii taml at neutral ph in addition pms feiii taml exhibited much higher efficiency for 4 cp degradation than so4 based oxidation as activated by heterogeneous α mno2 and cufe2o4 whereas comparable performance was observed for that activated by co2 the reusability of feiii taml was examined by successively adding 4 cp to the pms feiii taml system as shown in fig s2 nearly 100 4 cp removal was achieved after 5 runs suggesting feiii taml was stable for cyclic use the above results indicate that pms feiii taml is an attractive option for degradation of pollutants of concern in pms activation processes 1o2 o2 ho so4 and high valent iron oxo species i e feiv o are possible reactive species guan et al 2011 qi et al 2016 wang et al 2017b zhou et al 2015 epr spectra with temp as the trapping agent was used to examine the generation of 1o2 as shown in fig s3 a very weak 3 fold characteristic peak of the temp 1o2 adduct was detected in pms feiii taml with similar intensity to that in pms only suggesting 1o2 was not the major reactive species for 4 cp degradation as shown in fig s4 no reduction products of nbt were observed at 530 nm suggesting negligible formation of o2 in pms feiii taml system to confirm the potential role of ho and so4 on the 4 cp oxidation in pms feiii taml etoh was then employed as the radical scavenger because it possesses high reactivity towards so4 and ho with the second order rate constant of 1 6 7 7 107 m 1s 1 and 1 2 2 8 109 m 1s 1 respectively buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 negligible impact of etoh 100 mm on 4 cp degradation was observed fig s5 demonstrating that neither so4 nor ho was the major reactive species responsible for 4 cp degradation the evolution of the reactive radicals was further recorded by epr spectra employing dmpo as the trapping agent no signal of the typical dmpo ho or dmpo so4 adduct was detected in the epr spectrum fig s6 whereas a 5 5 dimethylpyrrolidone 2 oxy 1 dmpox peak was observed in pms feiii taml ahn et al 2016 the dmpox peak was also detected in h2o2 feiii taml as known feiii taml could activate h2o2 to produce high valent iron oxo complex feiv o taml chanda et al 2008 it is reasonable to speculate that feiv o taml was also generated in pms feiii taml due to its similar structure of pms to h2o2 fe k edge xanes spectra were employed to investigate the evolution of the fe oxidation state in pms feiii taml system as shown in fig 3 a the energy position of feiii taml was 7124 2 ev with the addition of pms fe k edge position of feiii taml shifted to higher region by 1 2 ev 7125 4 ev suggesting the formation of feiv o taml tiago de oliveira et al 2007 the formation of feiv o taml in pms feiii taml was further confirmed by uv visible spectra chanda et al 2008 as shown in fig 3b feiii taml exhibited a typical absorbance at 366 nm after addition of pms the typical absorbance disappeared whereas three new absorption bands at 420 525 and 800 nm appeared the new spectral pattern agreed well with that derived from h2o2 feiii taml at ph 8 5 and other work chanda et al 2008 validating the generation of feiv o taml in pms feiii taml negligible uv visible spectra change was detected in h2o2 feiii taml at ph 7 further demonstrating the inferior activation activity toward h2o2 at circumneutral phs in addition no uv visible spectra of fev o taml was observed previous study showed that h2o2 and other organic peroxides benzoyl peroxide tert butylperoxide and tertbutylhydroperoxide could result in the formation of feiv o taml only via single electron oxidation even in acetonitrile at 40 c collins and ryabov 2017 similar to h2o2 pms is assumably incapable of oxidizing feiii taml to fev o taml therefore the 4 cp degradation in pms feiii taml could be ascribed to the formation of feiv o taml compared with so4 and ho high valent iron species with moderate oxidation potential feature their selectivity in pollutants degradation sharma 2011 feiv o taml preferred to oxidizing organics through one or two electron transfer pathway with ph dependent activity collins and ryabov 2017 kundu et al 2012 the observed intermediates of 4 cp degradation in pms feiii taml are summarized in table s2 the detected carboxylate products i e maleic acid indicated the cleavage of the benzene ring during reaction less than 15 toc was removed fig s7 probably arising from the inferior oxidation potential of feiv o taml to so4 and ho for organic mineralization 3 2 kinetic modeling the kinetic model for 4 cp degradation by pms feiii taml were proposed based on the general catalytic mechanism of feiii taml activators eqs 1 4 kundu et al 2015a 1 fe iii taml pms k 1 k 1 fe iv o taml 2 fe iv o taml 4 cp k ii p pri fe iii taml 3 fe iv o taml p pri k i p fin fe iii taml 4 fe iv o taml pms k iii fe iii taml o 2 so 4 2 where k i and k i are the reversible reaction rates for feiii taml k ii and k i represent the reaction rate of feiv o taml with 4 cp and its primary degradation products respectively k iii is the decomposition rate of feiv o taml by pms ppri and pfin represented the primary and final degradation products of 4 cp respectively during the catalytic oxidation process feiii taml was reversibly oxidized by pms to form feiv o taml which either attacked 4 cp and its degradation intermediates or was decomposed by pms by applying the steady state approximation to the feiv o taml the concentration of feiv o taml and the 4 cp degradation in pms feiii taml could be described as eqs 5 and 6 respectively for simplicity k i and k iii was not considered in the presence of 4 cp as suggested previously kundu et al 2015a 5 fe iv o taml ss k i fe iii taml 0 pms k i pms k ii 4 cp σ k i p pri 6 d 4 cp dt k 4 cp 7 k k i k ii

taml feiv o taml k is the pseudo first order rate constants for 4 cp oxidation in pms feiii taml 3 2 1 effect of ph effect of ph on 4 cp degradation in pms feiii taml was examined over a wide ph range from 6 to 11 5 as shown in fig s8 the degradation of 4 cp below 60 removal fitted well with pseudo first order kinetic model at each tested ph however it deviated from the model at higher 4 cp removal data not shown correspondingly the k values for 4 cp oxidation were obtained table s3 and plotted as a function of ph inset of fig s8 the k values increased slightly at ph increasing from 6 to 8 5 and dramatically from 8 5 to 10 followed by a drop from 10 to 11 5 previous studies showed that the protonation states of pms guan et al 2011 feiii taml ghosh et al 2008 and 4 cp li et al 2018 as well as the oxidation potentials of feiv o taml kundu et al 2012 which are all dependent upon solution ph could exert profound impact on the formation rate k i or consumption rate k ii of feiv o taml to further investigate the effect of ph on 4 cp degradation the initial rate method was employed to calculate the k i and k ii values ghosh et al 2008 the initial rate r ini of 4 cp degradation was determined from the slope of the linear plot using the experimentally determined concentration of 4 cp 20 4 cp removal in this study r 2 0 96 the k i and k ii values were obtained from the slopes 1 k i and intercepts 1 k ii 4 cp 0 of eq 8 by varying the pms concentration from 0 5 mm to 3 0 mm kundu et al 2015a 8 fe iii taml t r init 1 k i pms 1 k ii 4 cp 0 as shown in fig 4 similar to k k i was also ph dependent the ph profiles of k i values could be rationalized qualitatively based on the ph dependent species distribution of feiii taml and pms text s1 feiii taml is six coordinate with two axial water ligands one of which tends to form hydroxo after deprotonation ghosh et al 2008 similar to h2o2 feiii taml ghosh et al 2008 the formation of feiv o taml in pms feiii tam combined both the pms binding to feiii taml and decomposition to an oxo ligand text s1 the deprotonated species feiii taml oh2 oh 2 of higher electron density than feiii taml oh2 2 would be oxidized by hso5 much faster in parallel so5 2 is of higher electron density than hso5 and therefore reacts slower with feiii taml oh2 oh 2 due to the stronger electrostatic repulsion as a result the plot of k i vs ph yielded an asymmetric bell shaped profile as shown in fig s9 the pka of feiii taml was 10 5 close to that reported elsewhere ghosh et al 2008 considering the pka2 of pms 9 4 guan et al 2011 the highest k i values should be theoretically available at ph between 9 4 and 10 5 which agreed well with the experiment data ph 10 the above results suggested that the ionization of both the axial coordinated water of feiii taml and pms played vital roles in the generation of feiv o taml moreover the k i values of pms feiii taml was higher than that of h2o2 feiii taml at ph 9 inset of fig 4 for example the formation rate of feiv o taml in pms feiii taml was about 30 14 and 2 times that in h2o2 feiii taml at ph 6 7 and 8 respectively obviously pms is more efficient than h2o2 to produce feiv o taml at circumneutral phs such superior catalytic activity could be ascribed to the asymmetry structure of the pms molecule with peroxide bond o o cleaved more readily than h2o2 guan et al 2013 hu et al 2017 it was not the case at ph 9 probably due to the stronger electrostatic repulsion arising from the deprotonated so5 2 which possesses higher negative charge density than molecule h2o2 pka 11 8 ling et al 2016 or ho2 in general pms feiii taml shows greater potential than h2o2 feiii taml in remediation of contaminated waters at circumneutral phs on the other side k ii also exhibited strong ph dependence with the highest value at ph 10 fig 4 the k ii values were about 2 orders of magnitude that of k i suggesting the formation of feiv o taml species was the rate determining step for 4 cp degradation the ph profile of k ii values could be explained by the competition between the electronic effects associated with protonation deprotonation of the feiii taml and the relative solvation effects due to the protonation state of feiii taml and feiv o taml both of which contributed to the overall free energy of electron transfer from 4 cp to feiv o taml kundu et al 2012 as the ph increased feiv o taml became less oxidizing due to the enhanced electronic effects whereas a lower solvation energy made it more easily reduced by 4 cp meanwhile the electrostatic repulsion between feiv o taml and 4 cp was increased which is unfavorable for 4 cp degradation the well fitting results of pseudo first order kinetics fig s8 also suggested the feiv o taml ss kept constant almost at the 4 cp removal below 60 eq 5 it probably arose from the formed primary degradation products which have a similar reactivity for feiv o taml with 4 cp i e k i k i therefore the feiv o taml ss at various phs could be obtained by using the initial concentration of 4 cp at a constant concentration of feiii taml and excessive pms as shown in fig s10 feiv o taml ss increased as ph increasing from 6 to 10 and then decreased at higher phs feiv o taml ss varied in the same way as k i because the formation of feiv o taml was the rate determining step for 4 cp oxidation and the highest k i was available at ph 10 furthermore feiv o taml ss were calculated to be 0 022 0 074 μm in this study that is the feiv o taml ss feiii taml 0 values ranged from 11 to 37 obviously feiii taml could be regarded as a promising activator of pms 3 2 2 effect of feiii taml dosage feiv o taml was reported to undergo spontaneous dimerization at ph 10 when feiii taml reached 1 μm or higher which would significantly compromise its oxidation potential banerjee et al 2015 to avoid such negative effect on the 4 cp oxidation the feiii taml dosage were set at 0 05 0 50 μm as shown in fig 5 a at the excessive dosage of pms 2 mm the 4 cp degradation was well fitted with the pseudo first order kinetic model at each given feiii taml dosage and ph 7 the k values were summarized in table s4 in addition the inset in fig 5a showed that the k values were increased linearly with the feiii taml dosage suggesting it was proportional to the formed feiv o taml the above results agreed well with the proposed kinetic model eq 7 3 2 3 effects of pms dosage effect of the pms dosage on 4 cp oxidation in pms feiii taml was examined at ph 7 as shown in fig 5b the decomposition of 4 cp followed the pseudo first order kinetics at varying pms levels the k values obtained in table s5 were plotted vs pms concentration inset of fig 5b at a preset feiii taml dosage 0 2 μm higher the pms dosage faster the oxidation rate for 4 cp in addition the k values increased linearly with the pms dosage up to 2 0 mm and then deviated from the linearity with the pms dosage increased from 3 0 to 5 0 mm at a given ph and feiii taml concentration the k values were determined by the concentration of pms and 4 cp according to eq 7 at ph 7 k ii was 263 times higher than k i resulting in at least 6 6 times of k ii 4 cp 0 higher than k i pms 0 at pms 2 0 mm thus the effect of k i pms 0 on the k values could be insignificant and eq 7 could be rewritten as eq 9 where a linear relationship was obtained between the k values and pms concentration 9 k k i k ii fe iii taml 0 pms k ii 4 cp σ k i p pri at higher pms dosage 2 0 mm the effect of k i pms 0 on the k values could not be neglected resulting in a deviation of the k vs pms plot from linearity 3 2 4 effects of reaction temperature the effect of reaction temperature on 4 cp degradation was explored at ph 7 fig s11 the k values increased from 0 093 to 2 263 min 1 as the temperature went up from 5 to 30 c based on the k values and the arrhenius equation the apparent activation energy e a for 4 cp degradation in pms feiii taml was calculated to be 30 5 kj mol 3 3 stoichiometric efficiency of pms previous study showed that feiii taml exhibited two different peroxide activating activity i e peroxidase like activity which transfer two oxidation equivalents from h2o2 to reducing substrates and catalase like activity which promote the disproportionation of h2o2 into o2 and h2o during feiii taml activation the latter process tends to decrease the stoichiometric efficiency of oxidation systems used to degrade refractory organic pollutants ghosh et al 2008 the decomposition of pms in the absence presence of 4 cp were examined to investigate the peroxide activating activity in pms feiii taml in 4 cp free no h2o2 decomposition was observed by feiii taml at ph 7 fig 6 a due to the inferior activation activity of feiii taml toward h2o2 at circumneutral phs whereas the decomposition of h2o2 reached 72 at ph 10 fig 6b owing to the high catalase like activity of feiii taml during h2o2 activation ghosh et al 2008 as for pms its reduction by self decomposition or feiii taml catalyzed decomposition was below 6 at ph 7 or 10 fig 6 suggesting the catalase like activity during pms activation was negligible therefore the k iii values could be neglected when determination of k i k ii and feiv o taml ss as suggested above the reason for the inefficiency of catalase like activity of pms feiii taml was possibly related to the electron withdrawing effect of sulfonate group which is expected to lower the electron density of o atom in the o o bond of pms and consequently prevent pms from being oxidized by feiv o taml eq 4 the above results further demonstrated that pms feiii taml was superior to h2o2 feiii taml for degradation of refractory organic pollution in the presence of 4 cp 200 μm 18 and 83 of pms were decomposed in 20 min at ph 7 and 10 respectively suggesting 4 cp was likely to serve as an electron donor to accelerate the decomposition of pms this was because feiv o taml was readily reduced by 4 cp to form feiii taml and the increasing concentration of feiii taml feiii taml t feiii taml feiv o taml accelerated the pms activation through eq 1 similar result was also observed in h2o2 feiii taml fig 6 if k ii 4 cp 0 k i pms the decomposition of pms followed well with the pseudo first order kinetic model which could be descripted as eq 10 text s2 10 d pms dt k i fe iii taml 0 pms the k i values obtained according to eq 10 was 3 3 102 m 1s 1 and 2 9 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 and 10 respectively comparable to that obtained by the initial rate method 2 7 102 m 1s 1 and 3 1 103 m 1s 1 respectively to evaluate the effectiveness of pms utilization for 4 cp degradation in pms feiii taml we calculated the stoichiometric efficiency η which is defined as the number of moles of 4 cp oxidized for every mole of pms activated eq 11 liu et al 2016 11 η δ 4 cp δ pms 100 where 4 cp and pms are the degradation and decomposition amounts of 4 cp and pms respectively as shown in fig s12 the oxidized 4 cp was linearly with the disappearance of pms with a slope of 0 97 1 0 gc ms results showed that benzoquinone was the major degradation intermediate after pms feiii taml oxidation fig s13 the formation of benzoquinone from 4 cp needs two electron abstraction by the oxidant eq 12 thus it can be calculated that almost all the oxidation capacity of pms was utilized in the pms feiii taml process as two electrons were abstracted from 4 cp by one pms to formation of benzoquinone eq 13 the pms feiii taml system is more efficient than the conventional co2 activated pms process where at least half of the oxidation capacity of pms was wasted eq 14 12 c6h5clo oh 2e c6h4o2 2h cl 13 hso5 2e so4 2 oh 14 hso5 co2 so4 oh co3 3 4 effect of inorganic anions and nom inorganic anions i e cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 exhibit negative effect on the so4 and ho involved oxidation because both radicals could oxidize inorganic anions such as cl and hco3 to produce the corresponding inorganic radicals with lower oxidation potential ji et al 2016 oh et al 2016 as for pms feiii taml negligible effect was observed on 4 cp degradation in the presence of 10 0 mm cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 fig 7 a however hco3 significantly inhibited 4 cp oxidation in pms co2 fig 7b via scavenging so4 and ho ji et al 2016 fig 7c shows that the 4 cp removal decreased from 90 to 66 in 9 min as the nom concentration increased from 2 5 to 20 mg c l respectively the negative effect of nom on 4 cp degradation was probably due to the direct competition of nom with 4 cp for feiv o taml for example when the nom concentration increased from 2 5 to 20 mg c l the k values for 4 cp degradation dropped down from 0 161 to 0 101 min 1 table s6 even that 4 cp removal in pms feiii taml was superior to the sulfate radical based oxidation fig 7d in which a large fraction of radicals were consumed by nom lutze et al 2015 oh et al 2016 the above results indicate that feiv o taml is more selective than so4 and ho for 4 cp degradation 4 conclusions in summary feiii taml 0 2 μm was used as green activator of pms for organic pollutants degradation the pms feiii taml system degraded various organic pollutants such as nb atz phba bpa and 4 cp with different efficiencies in istu xanes spectra uv visible spectra epr and radical quenching experiments confirmed feiv o taml was the major reactive species for degradation of 4 cp a model compound the catalytic oxidation performance of the pms feiii taml system was significantly influenced by solution ph with the highest activity at ph 10 increasing the pms and feiii taml dosage resulted in an enhanced 4 cp degradation the oxidation capacity of pms was almost completely utilized in the pms feiii taml process as one pms abstracted two electrons from 4 cp more interestingly negligible effect was observed on 4 cp degradation in the presence of 10 0 mm cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 and the negative effect of nom on 4 cp degradation in pms feiii taml system was much weaker than the conventional pms co2 system thus the pms feiii taml system can be regarded as a promising way to effectively degrade refractory organic contaminants in wastewater acknowledgments we

19246,herein we proposed a new catalytic oxidation system i e iron iii tetraamidomacrocyclic ligand feiii taml mediated activation of peroxymonosulfate pms for highly efficient organic degradation using p chlorophenol 4 cp as a model one pms feiii taml is capable of degrading 4 cp completely in 9 min at the initial 4 cp of 50 μm and ph 7 whereas the recently explored system h2o2 feiii taml could only result in 22 4 cp removal in 20 min under otherwise identical conditions more attractively inorganic anions i e cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 exhibited insignificant effect on 4 cp degradation and the negative effect of natural organic matters nom on the degradation of 4 cp in pms feiii taml is much weaker than the sulfate radical based oxidation process pms co2 combined with in situ xanes spectra uv visible spectra electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra and radical quenching experiments high valent iron oxo complex feiv o taml instead of singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide radical o2 sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals ho was the key active species responsible for 4 cp degradation the formation rate k i and consumption rate k ii of the feiv o taml in pms feiii taml were ph dependent in the range of 6 0 11 5 as expected increasing the feiii taml and pms dosage resulted in a higher steady state concentration of feiv o taml and enhanced the 4 cp degradation accordingly in addition the oxidation capacity of pms was almost totally utilized in pms feiii taml for 4 cp oxidation due to the two electron abstraction from 4 cp by one pms we believe this study will shed new light on effective pms activation by fe ligand complexes to efficiently degrade organic contaminants via nonradical pathway graphical abstract image 1 keywords iron iii tetraamidomacrocyclic ligand peroxymonosulfate high valent iron oxo complex catalytic oxidation nonradical pathway 1 introduction the ligand complexed fe at high oxidation states have attracted enormous interest in both research and application in degradation of aqueous organic pollutants liu et al 2018 su et al 2018 particularly the n donor ligand complexed fe i e non heme iron has been developed and successfully used to produce high valent iron oxo complexes bryliakov and talsi 2014 canals et al 2013 sorokin 2013 a classical case is feiii tetraamidomacrocyclic ligands feiii tamls developed to simulate the peroxidase and cytochrome p450 enzymes kundu et al 2015b feiii taml activators are also regarded as green and efficient catalysts for h2o2 oxidation su et al 2018 for instance feiii taml activators of dosage as low as 0 1 10 μm brought about the rate constants of h2o2 activation as high as 104 m 1s 1 under the optimal conditions sen gupta et al 2002 such outstanding reactivity make feiii tamls ideal candidates in oxidative degradation of phenols wang et al 2017a pesticides tang et al 2016 estrogens shappell et al 2008 dyes warner et al 2015 pharmaceutical ingredients shen et al 2011 and even explosives kundu et al 2013 however their catalytic activity toward h2o2 is strongly ph dependent with the optimal ph at 10 ghosh et al 2008 at circumneutral phs where most contaminated waters fall their reactivity significantly dropped down for instance nearly 100 degradation of reactive black 15 was observed at ph 10 after 15 min in h2o2 feiii taml whereas only 20 decolorization was realized at neutral phs chahbane et al 2007 therefore more efforts are urgently required to improve the catalytic efficiency of feiii taml activators for their application at circumneutral phs peroxymonosulfate pms also known as oxone is a derivative of h2o2 where one hydrogen atom is replaced by a sulfonate group ghanbari and moradi 2017 nowadays pms has been extensively investigated for catalytic degradation of organic contaminants of concern chen et al 2018 feng et al 2017 gong et al 2018 in general sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical ho are produced when the peroxide bond o o of pms is homolytically cleaved as catalyzed by transition metals zou et al 2013 metal oxide duan et al 2018 and ultraviolet uv irradiation guan et al 2011 in addition pms could be catalyzed by benzoquinone zhou et al 2015 phenols zhou et al 2017 and n doped graphene liang et al 2017 to produce singlet oxygen 1o2 which is a nonradical reactive oxygen species ros of electrophilic nature and prefers to oxidize pollutants with electron rich functional groups lee et al 2011 another nonradical pathway based on electron transfer from organic substrates to pms mediated by catalysts i e carbon nanotubes cnts yun et al 2018a modification nanodiamonds yun et al 2018b and noble metals ahn et al 2016 have also been discovered generally pms is easy to be activated over h2o2 in both radical and nonradical pathway due to its asymmetric structure ho oso3 for instance pms exhibited much higher reactivity than h2o2 for atrazine degradation via reactive radicals in the presence of magnetic porous copper ferrite cufe2o4 guan et al 2013 as for nonradical activation process it has reported that carbonized polypyrrole with graphitic n exhibited outstanding pms activation for selective degradation of phenol whereas negligible phenol degradation was observed for h2o2 hu et al 2017 recently iron porphyrin and phthalocyanine complexes were reported to activate pms for contaminant degradation via high valent iron oxo complexes chen et al 2017 jiang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 for example günay and cimen observed that feiv o pts was produced for 2 4 6 trichloropenol tcp degradation in the presence of fe porphyrin tetrasulfonate feiiipts gunay and cimen 2017 moreover the iron complexes usually exhibit high pms catalytic efficiency over a wide ph range light stimulated iron ii hexadecachlorophthalocyanine feiipccl16 could effectively activate pms at ph 5 9 to generate powerful feiv o intermediate for carbamazepine oxidation wu et al 2017 except for the iron complexes mentioned above our recent study found that fe n moieties fixated in the framework of graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 could activate pms to produce high valent iron oxo species which exhibited efficient and selective degradation toward p chlorophenol 4 cp li et al 2018 inspired by the above studies we speculate that feiii tamls possibly activate pms to generate high valent iron oxo complex over a wide ph range however to the best of our knowledge such pms activation process has never been reported yet the main objective of this study was to investigate the catalytic degradation of the pms feiii taml system by using 4 cp as a model compound effects of ph feiii taml and pms dosage on the kinetics of 4 cp degradation were examined and the underlying mechanism was systematically probed in addition the effect of coexisting anions and natural organic matters noms on 4 cp degradation was elucidated and the stoichiometric efficiency of pms was considered 2 experimental 2 1 reagents and

nitroblue tetrazolium nbt were obtained from sigma aldrich shanghai the prototype feiii taml activator its molecular structure shown in fig s1 was purchased from greenox catalysts inc mellon institute pittsburgh pa usa due to the commercial unavailability of taml it was obtained by adjusting the ph of feiii taml stock solution to 2 with hcl and stood for 24 h before fe iii removal via precipitation ghosh et al 2003 α mno2 and cufe2o4 were synthesized according to previous studies saputra et al 2013 zhang et al 2013b the sample of natural organic matter nom was obtained from international humic substances society ihss all the other chemicals were of analytical grade or more pure and used without further purification deionized di water with resistivity of 18 2 mω cm was used throughout the experiments stock solutions of feiii taml pms and h2o2 were freshly prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of the reagents in di water the concentration of feiii taml stock solution was measured by the uv visible spectrophotometer uv 2700 shimadzu co japan using the molar absorption coefficients of 6600 m 1 cm 1 at 366 nm wang et al 2017a 2 2 experimental procedures degradation kinetic experiments were conducted in 100 ml glass bottles in 20 c water bath under magnetic stirring first preset volumes of stock solutions containing target organic compounds i e 4 cp and oxidants i e pms and h2o2 were added to the 10 mm phosphate buffered solution and the substrates i e cl nom was added when necessary the ph values were quickly adjusted by sodium hydroxide or perchloric acid then the experiments were triggered by adding desired dosage of catalyst i e feiii taml and co2 during the experiments ph was kept at a preset value within a deviation 0 2 samples 0 7 ml were withdrawn at different intervals from the reactor and 0 1 ml na2so3 0 1 m was added to quench the reaction before analysis all kinetic experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate and the average values with standard deviations were presented fe k edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectra were collected at the 1w2b beamline of beijing synchrotron radiation facility beijing china at room temperature before analysis the spectra was calibrated by setting the maximum of the first derivative of fe foil spectrum to 7112 ev the xanes spectra of feiii taml and pms feiii taml were collected in fluorescence mode the spectrum of pms feiii taml was collected in an in situ reactor containing pms 4 0 mm ph 7 and feiii taml 2 mm after 5 min reaction zhang et al 2013a all the xanes spectra were

and h2o2 concentration was measured by the spectrophotometric method proposed elsewhere liang et al 2008 sellers 1980 superoxide radicals o2 were examined by nbt method bielski et al 1980 so4 ho and 1o2 were detected employing electron paramagnetic resonance epr emx 10 12 bruker germany spectra with 50 0 mm of dmpo and temp as the spin trapping agent respectively liang et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 feiii taml mediated catalytic activation of pms for organics degradation to preliminarily probe the catalytic reactivity of the pms feiii taml system the oxidation of different organic pollutants was investigated as shown in fig 1 a complete degradation of 4 cp and bpa was observed whereas less than 12 nb was degraded in 20 min atz and phba were moderately removed with the efficiency of 50 and 67 respectively the above results suggested that the pms feiii taml system could degraded various organic pollutants with widely varying efficiencies the catalytic efficiency of the pms feiii taml system was further investigated by comparing with other oxidation systems for 4 cp degradation as seen in fig 2 negligible 4 cp degradation occurred in 20 min by feiii taml only and pms taml at ph 7 while 3 of 4 cp was reduced by pms only such low removal of 4 cp by pms was possibly attributed to the formation of singlet oxygen 1o2 via the slow self decomposition of pms 0 2 m 1s 1 zhou et al 2015 on the contrary pms feiii taml exhibited highly efficient degradation of 4 cp where 50 μm of 4 cp initially underwent a complete degradation in 9 min however only 22 of 4 cp was removed in h2o2 feiii taml which has been extensively investigated to degrade various organic pollutants kundu et al 2013 tang et al 2016 wang et al 2017a obviously the 4 cp degradation in pms feiii taml was much faster than in h2o2 feiii taml at neutral ph in addition pms feiii taml exhibited much higher efficiency for 4 cp degradation than so4 based oxidation as activated by heterogeneous α mno2 and cufe2o4 whereas comparable performance was observed for that activated by co2 the reusability of feiii taml was examined by successively adding 4 cp to the pms feiii taml system as shown in fig s2 nearly 100 4 cp removal was achieved after 5 runs suggesting feiii taml was stable for cyclic use the above results indicate that pms feiii taml is an attractive option for degradation of pollutants of concern in pms activation processes 1o2 o2 ho so4 and high valent iron oxo species i e feiv o are possible reactive species guan et al 2011 qi et al 2016 wang et al 2017b zhou et al 2015 epr spectra with temp as the trapping agent was used to examine the generation of 1o2 as shown in fig s3 a very weak 3 fold characteristic peak of the temp 1o2 adduct was detected in pms feiii taml with similar intensity to that in pms only suggesting 1o2 was not the major reactive species for 4 cp degradation as shown in fig s4 no reduction products of nbt were observed at 530 nm suggesting negligible formation of o2 in pms feiii taml system to confirm the potential role of ho and so4 on the 4 cp oxidation in pms feiii taml etoh was then employed as the radical scavenger because it possesses high reactivity towards so4 and ho with the second order rate constant of 1 6 7 7 107 m 1s 1 and 1 2 2 8 109 m 1s 1 respectively buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 negligible impact of etoh 100 mm on 4 cp degradation was observed fig s5 demonstrating that neither so4 nor ho was the major reactive species responsible for 4 cp degradation the evolution of the reactive radicals was further recorded by epr spectra employing dmpo as the trapping agent no signal of the typical dmpo ho or dmpo so4 adduct was detected in the epr spectrum fig s6 whereas a 5 5 dimethylpyrrolidone 2 oxy 1 dmpox peak was observed in pms feiii taml ahn et al 2016 the dmpox peak was also detected in h2o2 feiii taml as known feiii taml could activate h2o2 to produce high valent iron oxo complex feiv o taml chanda et al 2008 it is reasonable to speculate that feiv o taml was also generated in pms feiii taml due to its similar structure of pms to h2o2 fe k edge xanes spectra were employed to investigate the evolution of the fe oxidation state in pms feiii taml system as shown in fig 3 a the energy position of feiii taml was 7124 2 ev with the addition of pms fe k edge position of feiii taml shifted to higher region by 1 2 ev 7125 4 ev suggesting the formation of feiv o taml tiago de oliveira et al 2007 the formation of feiv o taml in pms feiii taml was further confirmed by uv visible spectra chanda et al 2008 as shown in fig 3b feiii taml exhibited a typical absorbance at 366 nm after addition of pms the typical absorbance disappeared whereas three new absorption bands at 420 525 and 800 nm appeared the new spectral pattern agreed well with that derived from h2o2 feiii taml at ph 8 5 and other work chanda et al 2008 validating the generation of feiv o taml in pms feiii taml negligible uv visible spectra change was detected in h2o2 feiii taml at ph 7 further demonstrating the inferior activation activity toward h2o2 at circumneutral phs in addition no uv visible spectra of fev o taml was observed previous study showed that h2o2 and other organic peroxides benzoyl peroxide tert butylperoxide and tertbutylhydroperoxide could result in the formation of feiv o taml only via single electron oxidation even in acetonitrile at 40 c collins and ryabov 2017 similar to h2o2 pms is assumably incapable of oxidizing feiii taml to fev o taml therefore the 4 cp degradation in pms feiii taml could be ascribed to the formation of feiv o taml compared with so4 and ho high valent iron species with moderate oxidation potential feature their selectivity in pollutants degradation sharma 2011 feiv o taml preferred to oxidizing organics through one or two electron transfer pathway with ph dependent activity collins and ryabov 2017 kundu et al 2012 the observed intermediates of 4 cp degradation in pms feiii taml are summarized in table s2 the detected carboxylate products i e maleic acid indicated the cleavage of the benzene ring during reaction less than 15 toc was removed fig s7 probably arising from the inferior oxidation potential of feiv o taml to so4 and ho for organic mineralization 3 2 kinetic modeling the kinetic model for 4 cp degradation by pms feiii taml were proposed based on the general catalytic mechanism of feiii taml activators eqs 1 4 kundu et al 2015a 1 fe iii taml pms k 1 k 1 fe iv o taml 2 fe iv o taml 4 cp k ii p pri fe iii taml 3 fe iv o taml p pri k i p fin fe iii taml 4 fe iv o taml pms k iii fe iii taml o 2 so 4 2 where k i and k i are the reversible reaction rates for feiii taml k ii and k i represent the reaction rate of feiv o taml with 4 cp and its primary degradation products respectively k iii is the decomposition rate of feiv o taml by pms ppri and pfin represented the primary and final degradation products of 4 cp respectively during the catalytic oxidation process feiii taml was reversibly oxidized by pms to form feiv o taml which either attacked 4 cp and its degradation intermediates or was decomposed by pms by applying the steady state approximation to the feiv o taml the concentration of feiv o taml and the 4 cp degradation in pms feiii taml could be described as eqs 5 and 6 respectively for simplicity k i and k iii was not considered in the presence of 4 cp as suggested previously kundu et al 2015a 5 fe iv o taml ss k i fe iii taml 0 pms k i pms k ii 4 cp σ k i p pri 6 d 4 cp dt k 4 cp 7 k k i k ii

taml feiv o taml k is the pseudo first order rate constants for 4 cp oxidation in pms feiii taml 3 2 1 effect of ph effect of ph on 4 cp degradation in pms feiii taml was examined over a wide ph range from 6 to 11 5 as shown in fig s8 the degradation of 4 cp below 60 removal fitted well with pseudo first order kinetic model at each tested ph however it deviated from the model at higher 4 cp removal data not shown correspondingly the k values for 4 cp oxidation were obtained table s3 and plotted as a function of ph inset of fig s8 the k values increased slightly at ph increasing from 6 to 8 5 and dramatically from 8 5 to 10 followed by a drop from 10 to 11 5 previous studies showed that the protonation states of pms guan et al 2011 feiii taml ghosh et al 2008 and 4 cp li et al 2018 as well as the oxidation potentials of feiv o taml kundu et al 2012 which are all dependent upon solution ph could exert profound impact on the formation rate k i or consumption rate k ii of feiv o taml to further investigate the effect of ph on 4 cp degradation the initial rate method was employed to calculate the k i and k ii values ghosh et al 2008 the initial rate r ini of 4 cp degradation was determined from the slope of the linear plot using the experimentally determined concentration of 4 cp 20 4 cp removal in this study r 2 0 96 the k i and k ii values were obtained from the slopes 1 k i and intercepts 1 k ii 4 cp 0 of eq 8 by varying the pms concentration from 0 5 mm to 3 0 mm kundu et al 2015a 8 fe iii taml t r init 1 k i pms 1 k ii 4 cp 0 as shown in fig 4 similar to k k i was also ph dependent the ph profiles of k i values could be rationalized qualitatively based on the ph dependent species distribution of feiii taml and pms text s1 feiii taml is six coordinate with two axial water ligands one of which tends to form hydroxo after deprotonation ghosh et al 2008 similar to h2o2 feiii taml ghosh et al 2008 the formation of feiv o taml in pms feiii tam combined both the pms binding to feiii taml and decomposition to an oxo ligand text s1 the deprotonated species feiii taml oh2 oh 2 of higher electron density than feiii taml oh2 2 would be oxidized by hso5 much faster in parallel so5 2 is of higher electron density than hso5 and therefore reacts slower with feiii taml oh2 oh 2 due to the stronger electrostatic repulsion as a result the plot of k i vs ph yielded an asymmetric bell shaped profile as shown in fig s9 the pka of feiii taml was 10 5 close to that reported elsewhere ghosh et al 2008 considering the pka2 of pms 9 4 guan et al 2011 the highest k i values should be theoretically available at ph between 9 4 and 10 5 which agreed well with the experiment data ph 10 the above results suggested that the ionization of both the axial coordinated water of feiii taml and pms played vital roles in the generation of feiv o taml moreover the k i values of pms feiii taml was higher than that of h2o2 feiii taml at ph 9 inset of fig 4 for example the formation rate of feiv o taml in pms feiii taml was about 30 14 and 2 times that in h2o2 feiii taml at ph 6 7 and 8 respectively obviously pms is more efficient than h2o2 to produce feiv o taml at circumneutral phs such superior catalytic activity could be ascribed to the asymmetry structure of the pms molecule with peroxide bond o o cleaved more readily than h2o2 guan et al 2013 hu et al 2017 it was not the case at ph 9 probably due to the stronger electrostatic repulsion arising from the deprotonated so5 2 which possesses higher negative charge density than molecule h2o2 pka 11 8 ling et al 2016 or ho2 in general pms feiii taml shows greater potential than h2o2 feiii taml in remediation of contaminated waters at circumneutral phs on the other side k ii also exhibited strong ph dependence with the highest value at ph 10 fig 4 the k ii values were about 2 orders of magnitude that of k i suggesting the formation of feiv o taml species was the rate determining step for 4 cp degradation the ph profile of k ii values could be explained by the competition between the electronic effects associated with protonation deprotonation of the feiii taml and the relative solvation effects due to the protonation state of feiii taml and feiv o taml both of which contributed to the overall free energy of electron transfer from 4 cp to feiv o taml kundu et al 2012 as the ph increased feiv o taml became less oxidizing due to the enhanced electronic effects whereas a lower solvation energy made it more easily reduced by 4 cp meanwhile the electrostatic repulsion between feiv o taml and 4 cp was increased which is unfavorable for 4 cp degradation the well fitting results of pseudo first order kinetics fig s8 also suggested the feiv o taml ss kept constant almost at the 4 cp removal below 60 eq 5 it probably arose from the formed primary degradation products which have a similar reactivity for feiv o taml with 4 cp i e k i k i therefore the feiv o taml ss at various phs could be obtained by using the initial concentration of 4 cp at a constant concentration of feiii taml and excessive pms as shown in fig s10 feiv o taml ss increased as ph increasing from 6 to 10 and then decreased at higher phs feiv o taml ss varied in the same way as k i because the formation of feiv o taml was the rate determining step for 4 cp oxidation and the highest k i was available at ph 10 furthermore feiv o taml ss were calculated to be 0 022 0 074 μm in this study that is the feiv o taml ss feiii taml 0 values ranged from 11 to 37 obviously feiii taml could be regarded as a promising activator of pms 3 2 2 effect of feiii taml dosage feiv o taml was reported to undergo spontaneous dimerization at ph 10 when feiii taml reached 1 μm or higher which would significantly compromise its oxidation potential banerjee et al 2015 to avoid such negative effect on the 4 cp oxidation the feiii taml dosage were set at 0 05 0 50 μm as shown in fig 5 a at the excessive dosage of pms 2 mm the 4 cp degradation was well fitted with the pseudo first order kinetic model at each given feiii taml dosage and ph 7 the k values were summarized in table s4 in addition the inset in fig 5a showed that the k values were increased linearly with the feiii taml dosage suggesting it was proportional to the formed feiv o taml the above results agreed well with the proposed kinetic model eq 7 3 2 3 effects of pms dosage effect of the pms dosage on 4 cp oxidation in pms feiii taml was examined at ph 7 as shown in fig 5b the decomposition of 4 cp followed the pseudo first order kinetics at varying pms levels the k values obtained in table s5 were plotted vs pms concentration inset of fig 5b at a preset feiii taml dosage 0 2 μm higher the pms dosage faster the oxidation rate for 4 cp in addition the k values increased linearly with the pms dosage up to 2 0 mm and then deviated from the linearity with the pms dosage increased from 3 0 to 5 0 mm at a given ph and feiii taml concentration the k values were determined by the concentration of pms and 4 cp according to eq 7 at ph 7 k ii was 263 times higher than k i resulting in at least 6 6 times of k ii 4 cp 0 higher than k i pms 0 at pms 2 0 mm thus the effect of k i pms 0 on the k values could be insignificant and eq 7 could be rewritten as eq 9 where a linear relationship was obtained between the k values and pms concentration 9 k k i k ii fe iii taml 0 pms k ii 4 cp σ k i p pri at higher pms dosage 2 0 mm the effect of k i pms 0 on the k values could not be neglected resulting in a deviation of the k vs pms plot from linearity 3 2 4 effects of reaction temperature the effect of reaction temperature on 4 cp degradation was explored at ph 7 fig s11 the k values increased from 0 093 to 2 263 min 1 as the temperature went up from 5 to 30 c based on the k values and the arrhenius equation the apparent activation energy e a for 4 cp degradation in pms feiii taml was calculated to be 30 5 kj mol 3 3 stoichiometric efficiency of pms previous study showed that feiii taml exhibited two different peroxide activating activity i e peroxidase like activity which transfer two oxidation equivalents from h2o2 to reducing substrates and catalase like activity which promote the disproportionation of h2o2 into o2 and h2o during feiii taml activation the latter process tends to decrease the stoichiometric efficiency of oxidation systems used to degrade refractory organic pollutants ghosh et al 2008 the decomposition of pms in the absence presence of 4 cp were examined to investigate the peroxide activating activity in pms feiii taml in 4 cp free no h2o2 decomposition was observed by feiii taml at ph 7 fig 6 a due to the inferior activation activity of feiii taml toward h2o2 at circumneutral phs whereas the decomposition of h2o2 reached 72 at ph 10 fig 6b owing to the high catalase like activity of feiii taml during h2o2 activation ghosh et al 2008 as for pms its reduction by self decomposition or feiii taml catalyzed decomposition was below 6 at ph 7 or 10 fig 6 suggesting the catalase like activity during pms activation was negligible therefore the k iii values could be neglected when determination of k i k ii and feiv o taml ss as suggested above the reason for the inefficiency of catalase like activity of pms feiii taml was possibly related to the electron withdrawing effect of sulfonate group which is expected to lower the electron density of o atom in the o o bond of pms and consequently prevent pms from being oxidized by feiv o taml eq 4 the above results further demonstrated that pms feiii taml was superior to h2o2 feiii taml for degradation of refractory organic pollution in the presence of 4 cp 200 μm 18 and 83 of pms were decomposed in 20 min at ph 7 and 10 respectively suggesting 4 cp was likely to serve as an electron donor to accelerate the decomposition of pms this was because feiv o taml was readily reduced by 4 cp to form feiii taml and the increasing concentration of feiii taml feiii taml t feiii taml feiv o taml accelerated the pms activation through eq 1 similar result was also observed in h2o2 feiii taml fig 6 if k ii 4 cp 0 k i pms the decomposition of pms followed well with the pseudo first order kinetic model which could be descripted as eq 10 text s2 10 d pms dt k i fe iii taml 0 pms the k i values obtained according to eq 10 was 3 3 102 m 1s 1 and 2 9 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 and 10 respectively comparable to that obtained by the initial rate method 2 7 102 m 1s 1 and 3 1 103 m 1s 1 respectively to evaluate the effectiveness of pms utilization for 4 cp degradation in pms feiii taml we calculated the stoichiometric efficiency η which is defined as the number of moles of 4 cp oxidized for every mole of pms activated eq 11 liu et al 2016 11 η δ 4 cp δ pms 100 where 4 cp and pms are the degradation and decomposition amounts of 4 cp and pms respectively as shown in fig s12 the oxidized 4 cp was linearly with the disappearance of pms with a slope of 0 97 1 0 gc ms results showed that benzoquinone was the major degradation intermediate after pms feiii taml oxidation fig s13 the formation of benzoquinone from 4 cp needs two electron abstraction by the oxidant eq 12 thus it can be calculated that almost all the oxidation capacity of pms was utilized in the pms feiii taml process as two electrons were abstracted from 4 cp by one pms to formation of benzoquinone eq 13 the pms feiii taml system is more efficient than the conventional co2 activated pms process where at least half of the oxidation capacity of pms was wasted eq 14 12 c6h5clo oh 2e c6h4o2 2h cl 13 hso5 2e so4 2 oh 14 hso5 co2 so4 oh co3 3 4 effect of inorganic anions and nom inorganic anions i e cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 exhibit negative effect on the so4 and ho involved oxidation because both radicals could oxidize inorganic anions such as cl and hco3 to produce the corresponding inorganic radicals with lower oxidation potential ji et al 2016 oh et al 2016 as for pms feiii taml negligible effect was observed on 4 cp degradation in the presence of 10 0 mm cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 fig 7 a however hco3 significantly inhibited 4 cp oxidation in pms co2 fig 7b via scavenging so4 and ho ji et al 2016 fig 7c shows that the 4 cp removal decreased from 90 to 66 in 9 min as the nom concentration increased from 2 5 to 20 mg c l respectively the negative effect of nom on 4 cp degradation was probably due to the direct competition of nom with 4 cp for feiv o taml for example when the nom concentration increased from 2 5 to 20 mg c l the k values for 4 cp degradation dropped down from 0 161 to 0 101 min 1 table s6 even that 4 cp removal in pms feiii taml was superior to the sulfate radical based oxidation fig 7d in which a large fraction of radicals were consumed by nom lutze et al 2015 oh et al 2016 the above results indicate that feiv o taml is more selective than so4 and ho for 4 cp degradation 4 conclusions in summary feiii taml 0 2 μm was used as green activator of pms for organic pollutants degradation the pms feiii taml system degraded various organic pollutants such as nb atz phba bpa and 4 cp with different efficiencies in istu xanes spectra uv visible spectra epr and radical quenching experiments confirmed feiv o taml was the major reactive species for degradation of 4 cp a model compound the catalytic oxidation performance of the pms feiii taml system was significantly influenced by solution ph with the highest activity at ph 10 increasing the pms and feiii taml dosage resulted in an enhanced 4 cp degradation the oxidation capacity of pms was almost completely utilized in the pms feiii taml process as one pms abstracted two electrons from 4 cp more interestingly negligible effect was observed on 4 cp degradation in the presence of 10 0 mm cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 and the negative effect of nom on 4 cp degradation in pms feiii taml system was much weaker than the conventional pms co2 system thus the pms feiii taml system can be regarded as a promising way to effectively degrade refractory organic contaminants in wastewater acknowledgments we

19247,this work uncovers the implications of the estimation of exogenous inactivation rates for e coli after the initial lag phase and presents a strategy for the determination of the second order inactivation rate constants k2nd of these bacteria with relevant transient species promoted by solar light in natural waters for this purpose specific precursors were considered nitrate ion rose bengal anthraquinone 2 sulfonate as well as the respective photo generated transient species i e hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and triplet excited states under these conditions and by using suitable reference compounds acesulfame k and 2 4 6 trimethylphenol in different series of experiments the k2nd values were obtained after developing a proper competition kinetics methodology the k2nd values were 2 5 0 9 1011 3 8 1 6 107 and 1 8 0 7 1010 m 1 s 1 for the inactivation of e coli by oh 1o2 and the triplet state of anthraquinone 2 sulfonate 3aq2s respectively the measurement of a reaction rate constant that is higher than the diffusion control limit for small molecules in aqueous solution implies that bacteria behave differently from molecules e g because of the large size difference between bacteria and the transients the obtained k2nd values were used for the modeling of the bacteria inactivation kinetics in outdoor systems both water bodies and sodis bottles limited to the exponential decay phase that follows the initial lag time afterwards the role of dissolved organic matter dom as precursor of transient species for bacterial elimination was systematically studied the interaction of different sunlight wavelength regions uvb uv a blue green and yellow light with suwannee river sw and nordic lake organic matter nd was tested and the photoinduced disinfection exerted by dom isolates sw dom suwannee river humic acid suwannee river fulvic acid or pony lake fulvic acid was compared it was not possible to achieve a complete differentiation of the individual contributions of dom triplet states 3dom and 1o2 to bacterial inactivation however the application of competition kinetics to e coli under solar irradiation in the presence of sw led to a k2nd value of 2 17 0 40 1010 m 1 s 1 which is very near the value for inactivation by 3aq2s and suggests that the latter behaved very similar to sw 3dom and was a good 3dom proxy in the present case the determination of the second order inactivation rate constants of e coli with oh 3dom and 1o2 represents a significant progress in the understanding of the external inactivation pathways of bacteria it also allows predicting that after the lag phase 1o2 would contribute to photoinactivation to a far lesser extent than oh and 3dom graphical abstract image 1 keywords solar disinfection

efficiently eliminate a series of pathogenic bacteria responsible for enteric diseases mcguigan et al 2012 sodis takes advantage of solar light ultraviolet constituents which induce direct

matter dom giannakis et al 2016b 2016a romero maraccini et al 2013 romero et al 2011 rosado lausell et al 2013 vione et al 2006 for instance the photo excitation of no3 by sunlight produces the highly oxidative species oh which has documented disinfection capabilities eqs 1 and 2 mack and bolton 1999 meanwhile the interaction of sunlight with dom can produce a singlet excited electronic state eq 3 which through intersystem crossing isc may evolve into a triplet state 3dom eq 4 the triplet state is a reactive transient and it can act as disinfecting agent for bacteria eq 5 and viruses mattle et

quantitative information such as the second order rate constants k2nd for the inactivation of the bacteria by the transient species is scarce works on the apparent first order degradation kinetics for 8 types of bacteria under sunlight irradiation have been established but unfortunately the second order rate constants have not been assessed maraccini et al 2016a 2016b it would be very useful to know the k2nd values for bacterial inactivation because differently from the first order rate constants that strongly depend on the experimental conditions and are laboratory dependent the second order ones allow for generalizations bodrato and vione 2014 additionally although it is well known that dom plays an important role during the sodis process giannakis et al 2016b ndounla et al 2014 sciacca et al 2011 spuhler et al 2010 the literature has few studies seeking to understand the interaction of sunlight components with dom more specifically very little is known on how the origin and concentration of dissolved organic matter influence bacterial disinfection nguyen 2015 sinton et al 2002 while the knowledge base on viruses is significantly higher on aspects such as the photo generation of transients kohn and nelson 2007 reactivity silverman et al 2015 and effectiveness on different strains fisher et al 2011 romero maraccini et al 2013 the complexity of bacterial pathogens has not allowed for significant knowledge advancements therefore this work was focused on the following aspects that merit investigation as indicated by the absence of relevant studies 1 the k2nd

determination more details on the experimental procedure and handling can be found in mangayayam et al 2017 and giannakis et al 2018 2 3 reaction systems 2 3 1 competition kinetics using specific precursors of transient species under simulated sunlight aqueous samples 100 ml were placed in cylindrical pyrex glass bottles that have a cut off wavelength of 295 nm with a diameter of 4 cm and a height of 7 5 cm irradiation experiments were carried out with an atlas suntest cps solar simulator where the bottles were placed directly under the suntest lamp and magnetically stirred at 750 rpm here nano3 was used as oh source aq2s was chosen as a proxy compound for dom and rb was used as source of singlet oxygen 1o2 more information about these specific precursors of transient species is presented in supplementary material text sm1 2 3 2 light sources used for dom excitation the study of dom interaction with the different sunlight components was carried out in homemade aluminum reflective boxes equipped with the corresponding lamps the used uv b source was an array of three 20 w philips tl d 01 uvb lamps with narrowband emission at 313 nm for uv a radiation it was used an array of three 18 w philips tl d blb lamps with narrowband emission at 365 nm the irradiation under blue light was done with three lamps philips tl d 18 w 18 and that under green light with three lamps philips tl d 18 w 17 the yellow light was generated by five philips tl d 18 w 16 lamps such conditions were chosen so as to obtain for all of the lamps an irradiance of 40 2 w m2 over the irradiated solutions the emission spectrum of each lamp can be found in figure sm1 during the experiments the bottles were placed directly under the lamps and the solutions were magnetically stirred with magnetic bars 2 4 analytical techniques the irradiance spectrum produced by the specific lamps and the suntest apparatus was measured using an usb2000 spectrophotometer equipped with a pyranometer which is able to measure irradiance from 300 to 2800 nm the total organic carbon toc content in the dom solutions was determined using a shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer toc vcsn this analyzer was calibrated with standard solutions of potassium hydrogen phthalate the uv vis absorption spectra of the dom samples were measured with a shimadzu spectrophotometer uv 1800 the time evolution of the chosen reference substrates ace tmp and ffa was monitored by hplc using a hp agilent 1100 series chromatograph equipped with a dad detector and a supelco c18 column 250 4 6 mm 5 μm a summary of the chromatographic methods is presented in table 1 2 5 competition kinetics calculations the second order reaction rate constant quantifies the interaction reaction of bacteria with transient species this is a useful quantitative information for generalizations and kinetic analyses to obtain the second order reaction rate constants of e coli with relevant transient species the competition kinetics method was applied this method uses reference compound s and takes advantage of its their known reactivity with a given transient species mack and bolton 1999 competition kinetics methodology is based on the simultaneous elimination and monitoring of both the reference compound and the target therefore for the simultaneous degradation of a reference substance and of e coli our target the second order reaction rate constants in m 1 s 1 units of both the reference compound and the studied bacteria can be respectively expressed as follows k t r a n s i e n t s p e c i e s r e f e r e n c e c o m p o u n d k r e f e r e n c e c o m p o u n d 1 t r a n s i e n t s p e c i e s and k 2 n d k e c o l i 1 t r a n s i e n t s p e c i e s here k1 represents the pseudo first order decay constant of either the reference compound or the bacteria and transient species is the steady state molar concentration of the transient species in the simultaneous elimination of the reference and target these two components are in the same system and experience the same concentration of transient species therefore one can reformulate the above equations as k t r a n s i e n t s p e c i e s r e f e r e n c e c o m p o u n d k r e f e r e n c e c o m p o u n d 1 k 2 n d k e c o l i 1 experimentally one monitors the elimination of both bacteria and the reference compound and obtains their pseudo first order decay constants k1 then the second order rate constant k2nd between the bacteria and the relevant transient species can be determined according to eq 8 8 k 2 n d k t r a n s i e n t s p e c i e s r e f e r e n c e c o m p o u n d k e c o l i 1 k r e f e r e n c e c o m p o u n d 1 the k1 values are calculated as the slope from ln x xo vs time plots elaborated with the experimental data in the case of the reference compound xo and x denote the initial concentration and the concentrations at different treatment times respectively similarly for the e coli xo and x are the initial bacteria concentration and the concentrations at different treatment times respectively the second order reaction rate constant of the reference compound with the transient species k t r a n s i e n t s p e c i e s r e f e r e n c e c o m p o u n d in units of m 1 s 1 is usually available in the literature for the reaction of bacteria with oh 3aq2s and 1o2 acesulfame k ace was chosen as reference compound ace has second order reaction rate constants k o h a c e 5 9 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 k 3 a q 2 s a c e 5 5 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 and k 1 o 2 a c e 2 8 1 1 104 m 1 s 1 minella et al 2017 meanwhile for dom as 3dom source the reference compound was 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp which has a 3dom reaction rate constant of 1 8 109 m 1 s 1 and a much lower reaction rate constant with 1o2 6 3 107 m 1 s 1 halladja et al 2007 2 6 modeling of the photoinduced inactivation of bacteria the software apex aqueous photochemistry of environmentally occurring xenobiotics was here used to assess the photochemical inactivation lifetime of bacteria during the exponential decay phase that follows the initial lag time the apex software was used following the methodology described in the previous works of bodrato and vione and kohn et al bodrato and vione 2014 kohn et al 2016 further information on the modeling with apex is presented in text sm1 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli disinfection by transient species generated with solar light 3 1 1 bacterial inactivation by photo generated transient species the initial tests dealt with the ability of solar light to produce transient species from the precursors and to induce e coli elimination as a consequence to do so the effect of different nano3 aq2s or rb concentrations on bacteria disinfection was considered together with proper control runs dark experiments as well as experiments under irradiation alone without transient species precursors fig 1 solar light alone at 600 w m2 irradiance induced a reduction of 2 log units of the e coli population after 180 min of irradiation while 10 mm nano3 in the dark had practically no effect on bacteria during 180 min contact time control experiment fig 1a however the combination of sunlight with sodium nitrate accelerated significantly the elimination of bacteria which can be associated to the generation of oh and its subsequent reaction with e coli fig 1a also shows that an increase of sodium nitrate concentration from 1 to 10 mm lowered the time required for complete disinfection most likely due to a higher oh production from the photolysis of more concentrated nano3 eq 1 the e coli inactivation by the solar mediated excitation of anthraquinone 2 sulfonate is shown in fig 1b aq2s in the dark control experiment did not produce bacteria elimination even after 240 min of contact in contrast the irradiation of 0 01 mm aq2s resulted in an e coli reduction 3 5 log units that was higher compared to that observed under solar light alone 2 8 log units this is coherent with a disinfection effect by 3aq2s the microorganism elimination was significantly enhanced by increasing the aq2s concentration from 0 01 to 0 03 mm fig 1b however a further aq2s increase up to 0 1 mm had a detrimental effect on bacterial inactivation which became even lower than that observed with sunlight alone elevated aq2s levels could cause self competitive effects between excited states and the ground state photosensitizer maddigapu et al 2010 in addition to light shielding that can limit the direct action of radiation on e coli fig 1c shows the e coli treatment under simulated sunlight in the presence of rose bengal rb similar to the other photosensitizers rb in the dark did not show disinfecting action but the rb sunlight combinations induced strong e coli inactivation a relatively low 1 μm concentration of rb was enough to produce complete bacteria inactivation after 90 min irradiation when the rb concentration was increased from 1 to 100 μm the inactivation rate was significantly enhanced these findings highlight the ability of simulated sunlight to promote 1o2 formation through rb excitation considering these results 10 mm of nano3 0 03 mm of aq2s and 10 μm of rb were selected as concentrations values of photosensitizers for the competition kinetics experiments 3 1 2 competition kinetics using the specific photosensitizers under simulated sunlight ace was selected as reference compound for the competition kinetics experiments because it is non toxic and it is not biodegraded by e coli additionally ace does not undergo direct photolysis under sunlight and its second order reaction rate constants with oh 3aq2s and 1o2 are known minella et al 2017 fig 2 reports the experimental results used to calculate the pseudo first order rate constants for the interaction between e coli and the transient species note that in the case of the bacteria the initial lag phase was not considered and only the exponential decay phase was taken into account eq sm1 was used to calculate the second order inactivation rate constant of e coli by hydroxyl radicals 2 5 0 9 1011 m 1 s 1 by applying a corresponding procedure the second order inactivation rate constant between e coli and 3aq2s was calculated as 1 8 0 7 1010 m 1 s 1 finally the interaction between e coli and 1o2 yielded the corresponding second order inactivation rate constant 3 8 1 6 107 m 1 s 1 a summary of these results is reported in table 2 bottom row it can be noted from the data in table 2 that in all the cases the determined second order rate constants of e coli were higher than the respective ones with ace from a thermodynamic point of view bacteria are non equilibrium systems desmond le quéméner and bouchez 2014 thus they can either compensate for disturbances the lag phase or be easily affected by the attacks of reactive transient species which produces fast reaction kinetics after the lag phase it is also noticeable that k2nd e coli oh was much higher than the usually reported diffusion control limit for aqueous solutions 1010 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 actually such limit is derived from the assumption that the two reactants are similar in size which cannot clearly be the case for a transient species and a bacterium if the size difference is very large the diffusion limit can be increased by even a couple of orders of magnitude desmond le quéméner and bouchez 2014 moreover a bacterial cell could even incorporate some photosensitizer molecules the photolysis of which would thus take place inside the cell and thereby circumvent the need for the two species to encounter by diffusion finally the inactivation of bacteria under simulated or natural sunlight could be significantly enhanced by synergistic intracellular effects between uv a uv b and internal photoinduced transient species the synergy between uv a and uv b radiation has for instance been shown to induce faster inactivation than the sum of uv a and uv b provided separately buettner and hall 1987 the issue is that uv a and uv b radiations are able to damage the bacterial cell by means of different mechanisms that taken together in some circumstances could speed up the cell death this effect is enabled by the very complex structure and functioning of a bacterium and cannot be operational with a simple molecule such as ace on the other hand the measured second order inactivation rate constants with oh 3aq2s and 1o2 allow for modeling of the kinetics of the photoreactions involving oh 3cdom and 1o2 in sunlit surface waters as well as in sodis systems the results of photochemical modeling by using the apex software are reported in fig 3 first order photoinactivation rate constant as a function of the dissolved organic carbon doc two cases are shown of which one is representative of a natural water body water depth d 10 m fig 3a and the other of a sodis system 10 cm depth as for a water bottle placed over a roof fig 3b the inactivation kinetics is obviously much faster hours vs days in the shallower system in both cases oh and 3dom would be the main photoinactivation pathways for e coli while 1o2 would play a negligible role in particular under the assumed conditions 0 1 mm nitrate and 1 μm nitrite as oh sources in addition to dom and in the water body scenario the inactivation with oh would prevail for doc 4 ppmc and that with 3dom for doc 4 ppmc an increase of the doc is anyway detrimental to inactivation because elevated doc inhibits the oh process to a higher extent than it enhances 3dom minella et al 2017 a similar behavior is observed in the sodis system but in this case the oh 3dom transition is observed at around 7 ppmc it is to be highlighted that the predicted inactivation is referred to the first order process that follows the lag time thus the actual inactivation may be considerably longer in particular because the inactivation lifetime is the time needed to just halve the number of bacteria the achievement of effective disinfection in sodis by oh 3dom indirect inactivation would require much more than a day long exposure considering that actual sodis is considerably more effective than predicted here mcguigan et al 2012 it is clear that direct inactivation is very important inside a water bottle exposed to sunlight the same is not necessarily true in a real water body where the penetration of uv radiation the most effective towards direct inactivation in a water column of some meters is quite limited the modeling of dom photoactivity was based on its total amount measured as the doc and not on its source and type the experiments that follow are aimed at elucidating the effect of different types of dom on the photoinduced inactivation of bacteria taking into account both the reaction pathways and the inactivation kinetics 3 2 systematic study of the effect of dom on e coli inactivation 3 2 1 effect of the light type for the evaluation of the effect of different solar light components on the e coli inactivation in the presence of dom lamps emitting selectively uvb light uva light blue light bl green light gl and yellow light yl were tested as radiation sources a widely used reference dom suwannee river dom sw and a representative aquatic dom nordic lake dom nd semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 at a moderate concentration i e 2 0 ppm toc were considered control experiments for bacteria and dom in the dark were carried out as well figure sm2 fig 4 presents the disinfection curves obtained by using the different light types in the absence and presence of nd or sw under the tested conditions uv b and uv a by themselves i e without dom produced a strong inactivation of e coli whereas bl gl and yl had a low to negligible disinfection effect see text sm2 through these control tests i e dom absence one gets insight into the relationship between light induced inactivation pathways and the bacterial and enzyme photo reactivation processes giannakis et al 2015a b rincón and pulgarin 2004 thompson and sancar 2002 comparing the bacteria population evolution with and without dom it can be noted that dom particularly enhanced inactivation on the presence of uv b for sw and uv a radiation for both sw and nd in contrast the disinfection profiles of e coli exposed to bl gl or yl solar light components with wavelength longer than 400 nm either with or without dom were very close fig 4 the uv vis spectra of sw and nd figure sm3 suggest that these dom types have their strongest absorptivity in the uv a and uv b regions which is mainly associated to the presence of chromophoric moieties such as quinones and aromatic carbonyls relevant groups in the formation of 3dom chen et al 2002 golanoski et al 2012 sharpless 2012 sharpless and blough 2014 vione et al 2014 this issue could explain the acceleration of e coli disinfection in the presence of dom irradiated by uv a or uv b light fig 4 3 2 2 effects of dom type and concentration for the effect of dom concentration on e coli inactivation the experiments were carried out using uv a light see text sm3 fig 5 shows the e coli evolution under uv a irradiation with different concentrations 1 0 2 0 and 5 0 ppm toc of nd or sw for nd the presence of 1 0 or 2 0 ppm toc significantly enhanced the elimination of bacteria however at 5 ppm toc the resulting disinfection was back at approximately the same level observed without dom in contrast the addition of sw dom at both 2 0 and 5 0 ppm toc had an accelerating effect on the bacteria elimination as shown in eqs 3 7 dom is able to produce transient species that can inactivate bacteria giannakis et al 2016b ndounla et al 2014 sciacca et al 2011 spuhler et al 2010 and this effect is higher as the dom concentration increases however a large amount of dom may induce a detrimental effect associated to the scavenging of photogenerated reactive species most notably oh and the attenuation of light rodríguez et al 2016 because dom is largely made up of humic substances i e humic and fulvic acids rodríguez et al 2016 in order to study the ability of these components to inactivate e coli suwannee river humic acid swha and fulvic acid swfa as well as pony lake fulvic acid plfa were also tested the rationale for choosing swfa an allochthonous humic substance and plfa an autochthonous humic substance was to get insight into the role of the fulvic acid source on bacteria inactivation fig 5c compares the logarithmic reduction of e coli population after 180 min of treatment with sw and different humic substances at variable concentrations it can be observed that sw enhanced disinfection as the toc increased while swha swfa and plfa produced a disinfection peak at 1 0 ppm toc after the peak bacterial elimination decreased as the toc increased the differences among the tested dom samples and humic substances including their different sources halladja et al 2007 could be examined considering their optical and chemical characteristics i e e365nm phenolic content and electron donating capacity see table 3 figures sm3 and sm4 which affect their ability to produce transient species it can be noted that nd absorbs uv a light to a higher extent than sw see the e365nm value as a consequence compared to sw a lower nd concentration is required to have significant radiation absorption and produce a noticeable enhancement of e coli inactivation however nd has also higher ability to screen light and inhibit photo processes at high concentration see fig 5a and b as far as humic substances are concerned they are concentrated fractions of their respective dom types see ihss web site international humic substances society 2018 therefore the uv light absorption ability of swha and swfa is stronger than sw as indicated by the e365nm parameter see table 3 this means that low amounts of swha and swfa may produce a similar effect as that of sw at higher concentrations see fig 5c considering the data in table 3 it can be observed that swha and swfa have more phenolic moieties than sw because phenols are reducing agents the electron donating capability edc coherently follows the order swha swfa sw walpen et al 2016 it has been proposed that the radiation absorption of dom in the near uv region results primarily from intermolecular charge transfer between hydroxy methoxy aromatic electron donors which could be phenols and or methoxylated phenols and carbonyl containing electron acceptors such moieties include quinones and or aromatic ketones aldehydes sharpless and blough 2014 hence the higher phenolic moieties content and edc of swha or swfa compared to sw may explain their higher photo activity and the reason why a similar bacteria inactivation was achieved with lower swha or swfa concentrations 1 ppm compared to sw 5 ppm fig 5c however it should be indicated that a further characterization of dom regarding the other photochemically relevant moieties i e electron acceptors quinones and ketones will provides additional information on differences among the dom samples and humic substances on the other hand one should consider that plfa has more condensed aromatic groups than swfa and these groups promote the photochemical reactivity of plfa sciacca et al 2010 pfla has also a higher amount of nitrogen than swfa international humic substances society 2018 and the functional groups containing n are very important for some photochemical reactions of fulvic acids bushaw et al 1996 d andrilli et al 2013 therefore although plfa shows lower uv light absorption than swfa figure sm4 it is more effective in inducing bacteria disinfection fig 5c 3 2 3 competition kinetics using dom as source of transient species to complement the understanding of dom reactivity toward e coli a competition kinetics was applied to systems that use uv a light and sw or nd as sources of transient species most notably 3dom 1o2 and oh the compound 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp at 0 05 mm initial concentration was used as 3dom probe and reference substrate because tmp reacts mostly with 3dom with second order reaction rate constant k d 3 o m t m p 1 8 109 m 1 s 1 while reactions with 1o2 and oh occur to a lesser extent semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 tmp is non biodegradable pubchem 2018 and a preliminary assessment showed that it has no significant toxic effects on e coli even at 1 0 mm concentration figure sm5 the compound furfuryl alcohol ffa can be used as 1o2 probe semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 but unfortunately it cannot be used in competition experiments in the presence of bacteria because of its toxicity figure sm6 the overall rationale of the procedure here described is that the competition kinetics between tmp and the bacteria gives an estimate of the k2nd of e coli using the value of k d 3 o m t m p as reference under the hypothesis that bacteria inactivation is mostly caused by 3dom the k2nd value obtained for e coli with 3dom by using sw dom under uv a irradiation was 1 9 0 1 1010 m 1 s 1 which is very near the k2nd value measured with ace and aq2s see table 2 the most likely explanation to this finding is that 3aq2s and 3sw have similar ability to inactivate the bacteria and that inactivation by irradiated sw is mainly carried out by the triplet states 3sw in contrast with nd it was obtained k2nd 5 6 4 4 109 m 1 s 1 that is quite far from the target value this may mean that either the disinfection ability of 3nd is very different from that of 3aq2s and or that the disinfection carried out by nd under irradiation also involves an important role of additional transient species e g 1o2 and or oh interestingly nd is reported to have a high ability to produce singlet oxygen sharpless 2012 in order to get insight into the likely role of triplet states and 1o2 in bacteria inactivation with irradiated sw and nd two systems were tested the former was purged with n2 to remove o2 from the aqueous media while the latter was left in contact with air in a normal arrangement no n2 purging the normal air equilibrated system allows for the combined participation of 3dom and 1o2 to the disinfection process the n2 purged system was used to determine the interaction with 3dom solely indeed in the absence of dissolved o2 there is no formation of 1o2 while the 3cdom mediated processes are enhanced the half life time of 3dom in aerated aqueous solutions is in fact in the μs range while it is around an order of magnitude higher 20 80 μs in the absence of oxygen vione et al 2014 a comparable issue happens with the steady state 3dom in the same conditions a strong inhibition of bacteria inactivation was observed in the presence of nd irradiated under n2 atmosphere compared to the air equilibrated system figure sm7 which indicates that in this case 1o2 had an important role in e coli inactivation in contrast to nd the sw system with n2 purge was able to cause significant inactivation of bacteria this finding confirms that the excited triplet state of sw 3sw plays an important disinfecting action another supportive argument is the higher ffa degradation rate constant observed with nd under uv a irradiation compared to sw which suggests higher 1o2 photo production by nd see fig 6 a which also reports for comparison the values of the 1o2 formation quantum yields by nd and sw taken from the literature semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 these results agree well with the inferences derived from the discussion of the k2nd values and the overall findings suggest that the triplet states dominated the inactivation of bacteria in the case of irradiated sw while 1o2 played an important role in the case of nd therefore a qualitative schematic comparison between sw and nd can be proposed fig 6b on the other hand complementary experiments were performed under simulated sunlight which is relevant to actual sodis systems fig 7 and text sm4 competition kinetics to obtain the second order reaction rate constant for e coli with 3sw under solar light irradiation was carried out yielding k2nd 2 17 0 40 1010 m 1 s 1 which is in very good agreement with the value obtained with aq2s see table 2 this confirmed that aq2s is an excellent dom proxy in the case of sodis for e coli finally in addition to the irradiation of bacteria in the presence of dom the photo fenton pf process with 0 5 ppm fe2 and 10 ppm h2o2 eqs 9 and 10 was also studied as a source of hydroxyl radicals pf can be used to improve sodis in real waters ndounla et al 2013 sciacca et al 2010 coherently with literature reports it was also able to fast inactivate e coli in our system fig 7 interestingly the second order reaction rate constant for bacteria and hydroxyl radical from the pf system k2nd 1 27 0 45 10 11m 1s 1 also determined using competition kinetics data not shown was similar to the obtained by the photolysis of nano3 table 2 indicating the good applicability of competition kinetics to the same transient species generated in different ways 9 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 10 fe3 h2o sunlight fe2 oh h 4 conclusions we show here that simulated sunlight is able to promote significant formation of transient species from specific precursors i e nano3 aq2s and rb thereby enhancing the photoinduced disinfection of e coli the studied experimental system also enabled a successful application of the competition kinetics method to determine the second order inactivation rate constants of the bacteria with hydroxyl radicals the excited triplet state of aq2s here used as dom proxy as well as singlet oxygen these rate constants allow for the modeling of the bacteria inactivation kinetics in outdoor systems both water bodies and sodis bottles but only when the lag phase is over indeed a major difference between bacteria on the one case and viruses and chemicals on the other is that the photoinactivation of bacteria does not follow a purely first order kinetics but a lag phase is observed before the onset of inactivation bacteria are in fact able to carry out a certain level of compensation for the photoinduced damage but at the moment a suitable model approach is not available for the prediction of the bacterial lag time under environmental conditions the model results suggest that 1o2 plays a minor role in inactivation compared to oh and 3dom but also that the direct inactivation inside a sodis bottle likely plays a more important role than the indirect processes triggered by oh 3dom 1o2 which cannot really account for the photoinduced disinfection observed in sodis systems a further series of experiments showed that the uv a and uv b components of solar radiation significantly activated dom for e coli elimination the strong absorption by organic matter in the uv a and uv b regions is known to be associated to the presence of chromophoric and photoactive moieties such as quinones and aromatic carbonyls interestingly the use of humic substances isolated from dom had a comparable effect on disinfection as dom itself but the relevant behavior of humic isolates unequivocal disinfection enhancement at low toc inhibition effects at high toc was observed at lower amounts compared to the corresponding dom this is a reasonable finding when considering that humic substances are concentrated dom fractions additionally the comparison between nordic lake nd and suwannee river sw organic matter showed that in the nd case the photoinduced inactivation was likely carried out by both 3dom and 1o2 while 3dom alone prevailed in the case of sw this conclusion was obtained at the qualitative semi quantitative level by means of experiments that used competition kinetics with tmp as well as by comparison of results obtained in aerated systems vs n2 atmosphere unfortunately the latter comparison did not allow for a more precise quantitative differentiation between the 3dom and 1o2 pathways this fact could be associated to an incomplete removal of oxygen from the system or to the intrinsic dependence of 1o2 formation from 3dom actually the n2 atmosphere inhibits 1o2 but enhances 3dom at the same time especially when both 1o2 and 3dom are significantly involved in bacteria photoinactivation as in the case of nd if one additionally considers that it is not possible to carry out competition kinetics with the 1o2 probe ffa due to the toxicity of such alcohol to bacteria the use of individual precursors of transient species e g aq2s and rb is a more suitable approach to separately determine the k2nd values with 3dom and 1o2 still the competition kinetics with tmp in the presence of sw suggested that the k2nd value for e coli obtained with the use of aq2s was very near the value that could be measured upon sw irradiation this means that the ability of 3aq2s to inactivate bacteria is comparable to that of 3sw and that therefore aq2s was here a good proxy for sw dom furthermore although some preliminary data were obtained concerning the ability of different dom types to induce e coli disinfection in order to better understand the role of overall dom its origin autochthonous vs allochthonous and the presence of humic or fulvic acids more chemical analyses e g nmr ir of these substances are required chemical characterization of the ketone and quinone group content and structural forms in dom and humic substances are thus necessary to improve the comprehension of the interaction of these compounds with uv light and bacteria therefore a comprehensive dom characterization should be carried out in future works

19247,this work uncovers the implications of the estimation of exogenous inactivation rates for e coli after the initial lag phase and presents a strategy for the determination of the second order inactivation rate constants k2nd of these bacteria with relevant transient species promoted by solar light in natural waters for this purpose specific precursors were considered nitrate ion rose bengal anthraquinone 2 sulfonate as well as the respective photo generated transient species i e hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and triplet excited states under these conditions and by using suitable reference compounds acesulfame k and 2 4 6 trimethylphenol in different series of experiments the k2nd values were obtained after developing a proper competition kinetics methodology the k2nd values were 2 5 0 9 1011 3 8 1 6 107 and 1 8 0 7 1010 m 1 s 1 for the inactivation of e coli by oh 1o2 and the triplet state of anthraquinone 2 sulfonate 3aq2s respectively the measurement of a reaction rate constant that is higher than the diffusion control limit for small molecules in aqueous solution implies that bacteria behave differently from molecules e g because of the large size difference between bacteria and the transients the obtained k2nd values were used for the modeling of the bacteria inactivation kinetics in outdoor systems both water bodies and sodis bottles limited to the exponential decay phase that follows the initial lag time afterwards the role of dissolved organic matter dom as precursor of transient species for bacterial elimination was systematically studied the interaction of different sunlight wavelength regions uvb uv a blue green and yellow light with suwannee river sw and nordic lake organic matter nd was tested and the photoinduced disinfection exerted by dom isolates sw dom suwannee river humic acid suwannee river fulvic acid or pony lake fulvic acid was compared it was not possible to achieve a complete differentiation of the individual contributions of dom triplet states 3dom and 1o2 to bacterial inactivation however the application of competition kinetics to e coli under solar irradiation in the presence of sw led to a k2nd value of 2 17 0 40 1010 m 1 s 1 which is very near the value for inactivation by 3aq2s and suggests that the latter behaved very similar to sw 3dom and was a good 3dom proxy in the present case the determination of the second order inactivation rate constants of e coli with oh 3dom and 1o2 represents a significant progress in the understanding of the external inactivation pathways of bacteria it also allows predicting that after the lag phase 1o2 would contribute to photoinactivation to a far lesser extent than oh and 3dom graphical abstract image 1 keywords solar disinfection

countries to treat biologically polluted water from natural sources such as lakes rivers or wells for drinking purposes fernàndez ibañez et al 2017 ndounla et al 2014 this technique has been proved to efficiently eliminate a series of pathogenic bacteria responsible for enteric diseases mcguigan et al 2012 sodis takes advantage of solar light ultraviolet constituents which induce direct photochemical reactions on the dna bases of the cells and or the formation of reactive oxygen species ros by excitation of intracellular photosensitizers giannakis et al 2016b mcguigan et al 2012

matter dom giannakis et al 2016b 2016a romero maraccini et al 2013 romero et al 2011 rosado lausell et al 2013 vione et al 2006 for instance the photo excitation of no3 by sunlight produces the highly oxidative species oh which has documented disinfection capabilities eqs 1 and 2 mack and bolton 1999 meanwhile the interaction of sunlight with dom can produce a singlet excited electronic state eq 3 which through intersystem crossing isc may evolve into a triplet state 3dom eq 4 the triplet state is a reactive transient and it can act as disinfecting agent for bacteria eq 5 and viruses mattle et

quantitative information such as the second order rate constants k2nd for the inactivation of the bacteria by the transient species is scarce works on the apparent first order degradation kinetics for 8 types of bacteria under sunlight irradiation have been established but unfortunately the second order rate constants have not been assessed maraccini et al 2016a 2016b it would be very useful to know the k2nd values for bacterial inactivation because differently from the first order rate constants that strongly depend on the experimental conditions and are laboratory dependent the second order ones allow for generalizations bodrato and vione 2014 additionally although it is well known that dom plays an important role during the sodis process giannakis et al 2016b ndounla et al 2014 sciacca et al 2011 spuhler et al 2010 the literature has few studies seeking to understand the interaction of sunlight components with dom more specifically very little is known on how the origin and concentration of dissolved organic matter influence bacterial disinfection nguyen 2015 sinton et al 2002 while the knowledge base on viruses is significantly higher on aspects such as the photo generation of transients kohn and nelson 2007 reactivity silverman et al 2015 and effectiveness on different strains fisher et al 2011 romero maraccini et al 2013 the complexity of bacterial pathogens

precursors of transient species under simulated sunlight aqueous samples 100 ml were placed in cylindrical pyrex glass bottles that have a cut off wavelength of 295 nm with a diameter of 4 cm and a height of 7 5 cm irradiation experiments were carried out with an atlas suntest cps solar simulator where the bottles were placed directly under the suntest lamp and magnetically stirred at 750 rpm here nano3 was used as oh source aq2s was chosen as a proxy compound for dom and rb was used as source of singlet oxygen 1o2 more information about these specific precursors of transient species is presented in supplementary material text sm1 2 3 2 light sources used for dom excitation the study of dom interaction with the different sunlight components was carried out in homemade aluminum reflective boxes equipped with the corresponding lamps the used uv b source was an array of three 20 w philips tl d 01 uvb lamps with narrowband emission at 313 nm for uv a radiation it was used an array of three 18 w philips tl d blb lamps with narrowband emission at 365 nm the irradiation under blue light was done with three lamps philips tl d 18 w 18 and that under green light with three lamps philips tl d 18 w 17 the yellow light was generated by five philips tl d 18 w 16 lamps such conditions were chosen so as to obtain for all of the lamps an irradiance of 40 2 w m2 over the irradiated solutions the emission spectrum of each lamp can be found in figure sm1 during the experiments the bottles were placed directly under the lamps and the solutions were magnetically stirred with magnetic bars 2 4 analytical techniques the irradiance spectrum produced by the specific lamps and the suntest apparatus was measured using an usb2000 spectrophotometer equipped with a pyranometer which is able to measure irradiance from 300 to 2800 nm the total organic carbon toc content in the dom solutions was determined using a shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer toc vcsn this analyzer was calibrated with standard solutions of potassium hydrogen phthalate the uv vis absorption spectra of the dom samples were measured with a shimadzu spectrophotometer uv 1800 the time evolution of the chosen reference substrates ace tmp and ffa was monitored by hplc using a hp agilent 1100 series chromatograph equipped with a dad detector and a supelco c18 column 250 4 6 mm 5 μm a summary of the chromatographic methods is presented in table 1 2 5 competition kinetics calculations the second order reaction rate constant quantifies the interaction reaction of bacteria with transient species this is a useful quantitative information for generalizations and kinetic analyses to obtain the second order reaction rate constants of e coli with relevant transient species the competition kinetics method was applied this method uses reference compound s and takes advantage of its their known reactivity with a given transient species mack and bolton 1999 competition kinetics methodology is based on the simultaneous elimination and monitoring of both the reference compound and the target therefore for the simultaneous degradation of a reference substance and of e coli our target the second order reaction rate constants in m 1 s 1 units of both the reference compound and the studied bacteria can be respectively expressed as follows k t r a n s i e n t s p e c i e s r e f e r e n c e c o m p o u n d k r e f e r e n c e c o m p o u n d 1 t r a n s i e n t s p e c i e s and k 2 n d k e c o l i 1 t r a n s i e n t s p e c i e s here k1 represents the pseudo first order decay constant of either the reference compound or the bacteria and transient species is the steady state molar concentration of the transient species in the simultaneous elimination of the reference and target these two components are in the same system and experience the same concentration of transient species therefore one can reformulate the above equations as k t r a n s i e n t s p e c i e s r e f e r e n c e c o m p o u n d k r e f e r e n c e c o m p o u n d 1 k 2 n d k e c o l i 1 experimentally one monitors the elimination of both bacteria and the reference compound and obtains their pseudo first order decay constants k1 then the second order rate constant k2nd between the bacteria and the relevant transient species can be determined according to eq 8 8 k 2 n d k t r a n s i e n t s p e c i e s r e f e r e n c e c o m p o u n d k e c o l i 1 k r e f e r e n c e c o m p o u n d 1 the k1 values are calculated as the slope from ln x xo vs time plots elaborated with the experimental data in the case of the reference compound xo and x denote the initial concentration and the concentrations at different treatment times respectively similarly for the e coli xo and x are

halladja et al 2007 2 6 modeling of the photoinduced inactivation of bacteria the software apex aqueous photochemistry of environmentally occurring xenobiotics was here used to assess the photochemical inactivation lifetime of bacteria during the exponential decay phase that follows the initial lag time the apex software was used following the methodology described in the previous works of bodrato and vione and kohn et al bodrato and vione 2014 kohn et al 2016 further information on the modeling with apex is presented in text sm1 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli disinfection by transient species generated with solar light 3 1 1 bacterial inactivation by photo generated transient species the initial tests dealt with the ability of solar light to produce transient species from the precursors and to induce e coli elimination as a consequence to do so the effect of different nano3 aq2s or rb concentrations on bacteria disinfection was considered together with proper control runs dark experiments as well as experiments under irradiation alone without transient species precursors fig 1 solar light alone at 600 w m2 irradiance induced a reduction of 2 log units of the e coli population after 180 min of irradiation while 10 mm nano3 in the dark had practically no effect on bacteria during 180 min contact time control experiment fig 1a however the combination of sunlight with sodium nitrate accelerated significantly the elimination of bacteria which can be associated to the generation of oh and its subsequent reaction with e coli fig 1a also shows that an increase of sodium nitrate concentration from 1 to 10 mm lowered the time required for complete disinfection most likely due to a higher oh production from the photolysis of more concentrated nano3 eq 1 the e coli inactivation by the solar mediated excitation of anthraquinone 2 sulfonate is shown in fig 1b aq2s in the dark control experiment did not produce bacteria elimination even after 240 min of contact in contrast the irradiation of 0 01 mm aq2s resulted in an e coli reduction 3 5 log units that was higher compared to that observed under solar light alone 2 8 log units this is coherent with a disinfection effect by 3aq2s the microorganism elimination was significantly enhanced by increasing the aq2s concentration from 0 01 to 0 03 mm fig 1b however a further aq2s increase up to 0 1 mm had a detrimental effect on bacterial inactivation which became even lower than that observed with sunlight alone elevated aq2s levels could cause self competitive effects between excited states and the ground state photosensitizer maddigapu et al 2010 in addition to light shielding that can limit the direct action of radiation on e coli fig 1c shows the e coli treatment under simulated sunlight in the presence of rose bengal rb similar to the other photosensitizers rb in the dark did not show disinfecting action but the rb sunlight combinations induced strong e coli inactivation a relatively low 1 μm concentration of rb was enough to produce complete bacteria inactivation after 90 min irradiation when the rb concentration was increased from 1 to 100 μm the inactivation rate was significantly enhanced these findings highlight the ability of simulated sunlight to promote 1o2 formation through rb excitation considering these results 10 mm of nano3 0 03 mm of aq2s and 10 μm of rb were selected as concentrations values of photosensitizers for the competition kinetics experiments 3 1 2 competition kinetics using the specific photosensitizers under simulated sunlight ace was selected as reference compound for the competition kinetics experiments because it is non toxic and it is not biodegraded by e coli additionally ace does not undergo direct photolysis under sunlight and its second order reaction rate constants with oh 3aq2s and 1o2 are known minella et al 2017 fig 2 reports the experimental results used to calculate the pseudo first order rate constants for the interaction between e coli and the transient species note that in the case of the bacteria the initial lag phase was not considered and only the exponential decay phase was taken into account eq sm1 was used to calculate the second order inactivation rate constant of e coli by hydroxyl radicals 2 5 0 9 1011 m 1 s 1 by applying a corresponding procedure the second order inactivation rate constant between e coli and 3aq2s was calculated as 1 8 0 7 1010 m 1 s 1 finally the interaction between e coli and 1o2 yielded the corresponding second order inactivation rate constant 3 8 1 6 107 m 1 s 1 a summary of these results is reported in table 2 bottom row it can be noted from the data in table 2 that in all the cases the determined second order rate constants of e coli were higher than the respective ones with ace from a thermodynamic point of view bacteria are non equilibrium systems desmond le quéméner and bouchez 2014 thus they can either compensate for disturbances the lag phase or be easily affected by the attacks of reactive transient species which produces fast reaction kinetics after the lag phase it is also noticeable that k2nd e coli oh was much higher than the usually reported diffusion control limit for aqueous solutions 1010 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 actually such limit is derived from the assumption that the two reactants are similar in size which cannot clearly be the case for a transient species and a bacterium if the size difference is very large the diffusion limit can be increased by even a couple of orders of magnitude desmond le quéméner and bouchez 2014 moreover a bacterial cell could even incorporate some photosensitizer molecules the photolysis of which would thus take place inside the cell and thereby circumvent the need for the two species to encounter by diffusion finally the inactivation of bacteria under simulated or natural sunlight could be significantly enhanced by synergistic intracellular effects between uv a uv b and internal photoinduced transient species the synergy between uv a and uv b radiation has for instance been shown to induce faster inactivation than the sum of uv a and uv b provided separately buettner and hall 1987 the issue is that uv a and uv b radiations are able to damage the bacterial cell by means of different mechanisms that taken together in some circumstances could speed up the cell death this effect is enabled by the very complex structure and functioning of a bacterium and cannot be operational with a simple molecule such as ace on the other hand the measured second order inactivation rate constants with oh 3aq2s and 1o2 allow for modeling of the kinetics of the photoreactions involving oh 3cdom and 1o2 in sunlit surface waters as well as in sodis systems the results of photochemical modeling by using the apex software are reported in fig 3 first order photoinactivation rate constant as a function of the dissolved organic carbon doc two cases are shown of which one is representative of a natural water body water depth d 10 m fig 3a and the other of a sodis system 10 cm depth as for a water bottle placed over a roof fig 3b the inactivation kinetics is obviously much faster hours vs days in the shallower system in both cases oh and 3dom would be the main photoinactivation pathways for e coli while 1o2 would play a negligible role in particular under the assumed conditions 0 1 mm nitrate and 1 μm nitrite as oh sources in addition to dom and in the water body scenario the inactivation with oh would prevail for doc 4 ppmc and that with 3dom for doc 4 ppmc an increase of the doc is anyway detrimental to inactivation because elevated doc inhibits the oh process to a higher extent than it enhances 3dom minella et al 2017 a similar behavior is observed in the sodis system but in this case the oh 3dom transition is observed at around 7 ppmc it is to be highlighted that the predicted inactivation is referred to the first order process that follows the lag time thus the actual inactivation may be considerably longer in particular because the inactivation lifetime is the time needed to just halve the number of bacteria the achievement of effective disinfection in sodis by oh 3dom indirect inactivation would require much more than a day long exposure considering that actual sodis is considerably more effective than predicted here mcguigan et al 2012 it is clear that direct inactivation is very important inside a water bottle exposed to sunlight the same is not necessarily true in a real water body where the penetration of uv radiation the most effective towards direct inactivation in a water column of some meters is quite limited the modeling of dom photoactivity was based on its total amount measured as the doc and not on its source and type the experiments that follow are aimed at elucidating the effect of different types of dom on the photoinduced inactivation of bacteria taking into account both the reaction pathways and the inactivation kinetics 3 2 systematic study of the effect of dom on e coli inactivation 3 2 1 effect of the light type for the evaluation of the effect of different solar light components on the e coli inactivation in the presence of dom lamps emitting selectively uvb light uva light blue light bl green light gl and yellow light yl were tested as radiation sources a widely used reference dom suwannee river dom sw and a representative aquatic dom nordic lake dom nd semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 at a moderate concentration i e 2 0 ppm toc were considered control experiments for bacteria and dom in the dark were carried out as well figure sm2 fig 4 presents the disinfection curves obtained by using the different light types in the absence and presence of nd or sw under the tested conditions uv b and uv a by themselves i e without dom produced a strong inactivation of e coli whereas bl gl and yl had a low to negligible disinfection effect see text sm2 through these control tests i e dom absence one gets insight into the relationship between light induced inactivation pathways and the bacterial and enzyme photo reactivation processes giannakis et al 2015a b rincón and pulgarin 2004 thompson and sancar 2002 comparing the bacteria population evolution with and without dom it can be noted that dom particularly enhanced inactivation on the presence of uv b for sw and uv a radiation for both sw and nd in contrast the disinfection profiles of e coli exposed to bl gl or yl solar light components with wavelength longer than 400 nm either with or without dom were very close fig 4 the uv vis spectra of sw and nd figure sm3 suggest that these dom types have their strongest absorptivity in the uv a and uv b regions which is mainly associated to the presence of chromophoric moieties such as quinones and aromatic carbonyls relevant groups in the formation of 3dom chen et al 2002 golanoski et al 2012 sharpless 2012 sharpless and blough 2014 vione et al 2014 this issue could explain the acceleration of e coli disinfection in the presence of dom irradiated by uv a or uv b light fig 4 3 2 2 effects of dom type and concentration for the effect of dom concentration on e coli inactivation the experiments were carried out using uv a light see text sm3 fig 5 shows the e coli evolution under uv a irradiation with different concentrations 1 0 2 0 and 5 0 ppm toc of nd or sw for nd the presence of 1 0 or 2 0 ppm toc significantly enhanced the elimination of bacteria however at 5 ppm toc the resulting disinfection was back at approximately the same level observed without dom in contrast the addition of sw dom at both 2 0 and 5 0 ppm toc had an accelerating effect on the bacteria elimination as shown in eqs 3 7 dom is able to produce transient species that can inactivate bacteria giannakis et al 2016b ndounla et al 2014 sciacca et al 2011 spuhler et al 2010 and this effect is higher as the dom concentration increases however a large amount of dom may induce a detrimental effect associated to the scavenging of photogenerated reactive species most notably oh and the attenuation of light rodríguez et al 2016 because dom is largely made up of humic substances i e humic and fulvic acids rodríguez et al 2016 in order to study the ability of these components to inactivate e coli suwannee river humic acid swha and fulvic acid swfa as well as pony lake fulvic acid plfa were also tested the rationale for choosing swfa an allochthonous humic substance and plfa an autochthonous humic substance was to get insight into the role of the fulvic acid source on bacteria inactivation fig 5c compares the logarithmic reduction of e coli population after 180 min of treatment with sw and different humic substances at variable concentrations it can be observed that sw enhanced disinfection as the toc increased while swha swfa and plfa produced a disinfection peak at 1 0 ppm toc after the peak bacterial elimination decreased as the toc increased the differences among the tested dom samples and humic substances including their different sources halladja et al 2007 could be examined considering their optical and chemical characteristics i e e365nm phenolic content and electron donating capacity see table 3 figures sm3 and sm4 which affect their ability to produce transient species it can be noted that nd absorbs uv a light to a higher extent than sw see the e365nm value as a consequence compared to sw a lower nd concentration is required to have significant radiation absorption and produce a noticeable enhancement of e coli inactivation however nd has also higher ability to screen light and inhibit photo processes at high concentration see fig 5a and b as far as humic substances are concerned they are concentrated fractions of their respective dom types see ihss web site international humic substances society 2018 therefore the uv light absorption ability of swha and swfa is stronger than sw as indicated by the e365nm parameter see table 3 this means that low amounts of swha and swfa may produce a similar effect as that of sw at higher concentrations see fig 5c considering the data in table 3 it can be observed that swha and swfa have more phenolic moieties than sw because phenols are reducing agents the electron donating capability edc coherently follows the order swha swfa sw walpen et al 2016 it has been proposed that the radiation absorption of dom in the near uv region results primarily from intermolecular charge transfer between hydroxy methoxy aromatic electron donors which could be phenols and or methoxylated phenols and carbonyl containing electron acceptors such moieties include quinones and or aromatic ketones aldehydes sharpless and blough 2014 hence the higher phenolic moieties content and edc of swha or swfa compared to sw may explain their higher photo activity and the reason why a similar bacteria inactivation was achieved with lower swha or swfa concentrations 1 ppm compared to sw 5 ppm fig 5c however it should be indicated that a further characterization of dom regarding the other photochemically relevant moieties i e electron acceptors quinones and ketones will provides additional information on differences among the dom samples and humic substances on the other hand one should consider that plfa has more condensed aromatic groups than swfa and these groups promote the photochemical reactivity of plfa sciacca et al 2010 pfla has also a higher amount of nitrogen than swfa international humic substances society 2018 and the functional groups containing n are very important for some photochemical reactions of fulvic acids bushaw et al 1996 d andrilli et al 2013 therefore although plfa shows lower uv light absorption than swfa figure sm4 it is more effective in inducing bacteria disinfection fig 5c 3 2 3 competition kinetics using dom as source of transient species to complement the understanding of dom reactivity toward e coli a competition kinetics was applied to systems that use uv a light and sw or nd as sources of transient species most notably 3dom 1o2 and oh the compound 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp at 0 05 mm initial concentration was used as 3dom probe and reference substrate because tmp reacts mostly with 3dom with second order reaction rate constant k d 3 o m t m p 1 8 109 m 1 s 1 while reactions with 1o2 and oh occur to a lesser extent semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 tmp is non biodegradable pubchem 2018 and a preliminary assessment showed that it has no significant toxic effects on e coli even at 1 0 mm concentration figure sm5 the compound furfuryl alcohol ffa can be used as 1o2 probe semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 but unfortunately it cannot be used in competition experiments in the presence of bacteria because of its toxicity figure sm6 the overall rationale of the procedure here described is that the competition kinetics between tmp and the bacteria gives an estimate of the k2nd of e coli using the value of k d 3 o m t m p as reference under the hypothesis that bacteria inactivation is mostly caused by 3dom the k2nd value obtained for e coli with 3dom by using sw dom under uv a irradiation was 1 9 0 1 1010 m 1 s 1 which is very near the k2nd value measured with ace and aq2s see table 2 the most likely explanation to this finding is that 3aq2s and 3sw have similar ability to inactivate the bacteria and that inactivation by irradiated sw is mainly carried out by the triplet states 3sw in contrast with nd it was obtained k2nd 5 6 4 4 109 m 1 s 1 that is quite far from the target value this may mean that either the disinfection ability of 3nd is very different from that of 3aq2s and or that the disinfection carried out by nd under irradiation also involves an important role of additional transient species e g 1o2 and or oh interestingly nd is reported to have a high ability to produce singlet oxygen sharpless 2012 in order to get insight into the likely role of triplet states and 1o2 in bacteria inactivation with irradiated sw and nd two systems were tested the former was purged with n2 to remove o2 from the aqueous media while the latter was left in contact with air in a normal arrangement no n2 purging the normal air equilibrated system allows for the combined participation of 3dom and 1o2 to the disinfection process the n2 purged system was used to determine the interaction with 3dom solely indeed in the absence of dissolved o2 there is no formation of 1o2 while the 3cdom mediated processes are enhanced the half life time of 3dom in aerated aqueous solutions is in fact in the μs range while it is around an order of magnitude higher 20 80 μs in the absence of oxygen vione et al 2014 a comparable issue happens with the steady state 3dom in the same conditions a strong inhibition of bacteria inactivation was observed in the presence of nd irradiated under n2 atmosphere compared to the air equilibrated system figure sm7 which indicates that in this case 1o2 had an important role in e coli inactivation in contrast to nd the sw system with n2 purge was able to cause significant inactivation of bacteria this finding confirms that the excited triplet state of sw 3sw plays an important disinfecting action another supportive argument is the higher ffa degradation rate constant observed with nd under uv a irradiation compared to sw which suggests higher 1o2 photo production by nd see fig 6 a which also reports for comparison the values of the 1o2 formation quantum yields by nd and sw taken from the literature semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 these results agree well with the inferences derived from the discussion of the k2nd values and the overall findings suggest that the triplet states dominated the inactivation of bacteria in the case of irradiated sw while 1o2 played an important role in the case of nd therefore a qualitative schematic comparison between sw and nd can be proposed fig 6b on the other hand complementary experiments were performed under simulated sunlight which is relevant to actual sodis systems fig 7 and text sm4 competition kinetics to obtain the second order reaction rate constant for e coli with 3sw under solar light irradiation was carried out yielding k2nd 2 17 0 40 1010 m 1 s 1 which is in very good agreement with the value obtained with aq2s see table 2 this confirmed that aq2s is an excellent dom proxy in the case of sodis for e coli finally in addition to the irradiation of bacteria in the presence of dom the photo fenton pf process with 0 5 ppm fe2 and 10 ppm h2o2 eqs 9 and 10 was also studied as a source of hydroxyl radicals pf can be used to improve sodis in real waters ndounla et al 2013 sciacca et al 2010 coherently with literature reports it was also able to fast inactivate e coli in our system fig 7 interestingly the second order reaction rate constant for bacteria and hydroxyl radical from the pf system k2nd 1 27 0 45 10 11m 1s 1 also determined using competition kinetics data not shown was similar to the obtained by the photolysis of nano3 table 2 indicating the good applicability of competition kinetics to the same transient species generated in different ways 9 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 10 fe3 h2o sunlight fe2 oh h 4 conclusions we show here that simulated sunlight is able to promote significant formation of transient species from specific precursors i e nano3 aq2s and rb thereby enhancing the photoinduced disinfection of e coli the studied experimental system also enabled a successful application of the competition kinetics method to determine the second order inactivation rate constants of the bacteria with hydroxyl radicals the excited triplet state of aq2s here used as dom proxy as well as singlet oxygen these rate constants allow for the modeling of the bacteria inactivation kinetics in outdoor systems both water bodies and sodis bottles but only when the lag phase is over indeed a major difference between bacteria on the one case and viruses and chemicals on the other is that the photoinactivation of bacteria does not follow a purely first order kinetics but a lag phase is observed before the onset of inactivation bacteria are in fact able to carry out a certain level of compensation for the photoinduced damage but at the moment a suitable model approach is not available for the prediction of the bacterial lag time under environmental conditions the model results suggest that 1o2 plays a minor role in inactivation compared to oh and 3dom but also that the direct inactivation inside a sodis bottle likely plays a more important role than the indirect processes triggered by oh 3dom 1o2 which cannot really account for the photoinduced disinfection observed in sodis systems a further series of experiments showed that the uv a and uv b components of solar radiation significantly activated dom for e coli elimination the strong absorption by organic matter in the uv a and uv b regions is known to be associated to the presence of chromophoric and photoactive moieties such as quinones and aromatic carbonyls interestingly the use of humic substances isolated from dom had a comparable effect on disinfection as dom itself but the relevant behavior of humic isolates unequivocal disinfection enhancement at low toc inhibition effects at high toc was observed at lower amounts compared to the corresponding dom this is a reasonable finding when considering that humic substances are concentrated dom fractions additionally the comparison between nordic lake nd and suwannee river sw organic matter showed that in the nd case the photoinduced inactivation was likely carried out by both 3dom and 1o2 while 3dom alone prevailed in the case of sw this conclusion was obtained at the qualitative semi quantitative level by means of experiments that used competition kinetics with tmp as well as by comparison of results obtained in aerated systems vs n2 atmosphere unfortunately the latter comparison did not allow for a more precise quantitative differentiation between the 3dom and 1o2 pathways this fact could be associated to an incomplete removal of oxygen from the system or to the intrinsic dependence of 1o2 formation from 3dom actually the n2 atmosphere inhibits 1o2 but enhances 3dom at the same time especially when both 1o2 and 3dom are significantly involved in bacteria photoinactivation as in the case of nd if one additionally considers that it is not possible to carry out competition kinetics with the 1o2 probe ffa due to the toxicity of such alcohol to bacteria the use of individual precursors of transient species e g aq2s and rb is a more suitable approach to separately determine the k2nd values with 3dom and 1o2 still the competition kinetics with tmp in the presence of sw suggested that the k2nd value for e coli obtained with the use of aq2s was very near the value that could be measured upon sw irradiation this means that the ability of 3aq2s to inactivate bacteria is comparable to that of 3sw and that therefore aq2s was here a good proxy for sw dom furthermore although some preliminary data were obtained concerning the ability of different dom types to induce e coli disinfection in order to better understand the role of overall dom its origin autochthonous vs allochthonous and the presence of humic or fulvic acids more chemical analyses e g nmr ir of these substances are required chemical characterization of the ketone and quinone group content and structural forms in dom and humic substances are thus necessary to improve the comprehension of the interaction of these compounds with uv light and bacteria therefore a comprehensive dom characterization should be carried out in future works

19248,iodinated disinfection byproducts dbps are widely present in disinfected drinking waters and wastewater effluents and they have drawn increasing concern owing to their high toxicity to date the reported iodinated dbps mainly include aliphatic and aromatic ones and iodinated trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are the most commonly detected aliphatic iodinated dbps in disinfected waters in this study the formation of iodinated thms and haas from aromatic iodinated dbps during chloramination was investigated the decomposition kinetics of the aromatic iodinated dbps and the formation of iodinated thms and haas were studied the formation pathways of iodinated thms and haas from the aromatic iodinated dbps were explored the factors affecting the formation were examined and the toxicity change was evaluated the results revealed that four aromatic iodinated dbps 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol all underwent transformation to form triiodomethane tim monoiodoacetic acid miaa and diiodoacetic acid diaa during chloramination the decomposition of the aromatic iodinated dbps all followed a pseudo first order decay during chloramination and the rank order of the decomposition rate constants was as follows 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol several polar iodinated intermediates were detected and identified e g 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone and iodobutenedioic acid during chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol based on which the formation pathways of tim miaa and diaa from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination were proposed and further validated the results also revealed that monochloramine dose ph temperature and short free chlorine contact time all affected the formation of tim miaa and diaa from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination the cytotoxicity order of the eight iodinated dbps was miaa 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol 2 4 6 triiodophenol 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone diaa 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde tim the toxicity of the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiiodophenol sample first decreased and then increased over time due to the transformation graphical abstract image 1 keywords dbps iodinated dbps aromatic iodinated dbps iodinated thms iodinated haas chloramination 1 introduction iodide widely exists in source waters and wastewater effluents 0 4 104 2 μg l gong and zhang 2013 richardson et al 2008 and it can be oxidized to hoi during water disinfection hoi can further react with organic matter in waters to form iodinated disinfection byproducts dbps bichsel and von gunten 2000 which have been demonstrated to be significantly more toxic than their chlorinated and or brominated analogues liu and zhang 2014 plewa et al 2004 therefore iodinated dbps have drawn increasing concern recently iodinated dbps have been reported to be widely present in disinfected waters predominantly including two categories aliphatic ones and aromatic ones pan et al 2016 plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2008 yang and zhang 2013 to date the reported aliphatic iodinated dbps mainly comprise iodinated trihalomethanes thms iodinated aliphatic acids and iodinated haloacetamides chu et al 2012 plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2008 while the reported aromatic iodinated dbps are mainly classified into four groups based on the structures iodinated phenols iodinated hydroxybenzaldehydes iodinated hydroxybenzoic acids and iodinated nitrophenols pan et al 2016 yang and zhang 2013 recently more and more water utilities have switched from chlorination to chloramination or a combination of them to control the concentrations of regulated thms and haloacetic acids haas richardson et al 2008 seidel et al 2005 however higher occurrence frequencies and levels of iodinated dbps were generated in chloraminated drinking waters compared with chlorinated ones hua and reckhow 2007 chlorinated and brominated thms and haas are two major classes of organic dbps regulated by u s epa richardson et al 2007 since iodinated thms and haas are significantly more toxic than their chlorinated and or brominated analogues liu and zhang 2014 plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2007 and are commonly present in chloraminated drinking waters hu et al 2018 pan et al 2016 they may become regulated dbps in the future moreover triiodomethane tim could result in odor problems with a low concentration threshold of 0 02 μg l cancho et al 2000 thus iodinated thms and haas may need to be specifically concerned besides the newly identified aromatic iodinated dbps also received much attention owing to their wide occurrence and high toxicity among them 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were of higher occurrence frequencies and levels than other aromatic iodinated dbps in disinfected waters pan et al 2016 yang and zhang 2013 thus the investigation concerning iodinated thms and haas as well as the four aromatic iodinated dbps may be critical for water quality control previously it has been reported that some dbps further reacted with disinfectants to undergo transformation and decomposition to form other dbps for example 4 iodophenol transformed to 2 4 6 triiodophenol and further to 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol during chloramination gong et al 2017 in another previous study it was demonstrated that some aromatic brominated dbps transformed to other halogenated dbps including chlorinated and brominated thms and haas during chlorination however the transformation pathways were not thoroughly studied and few quantitative data were provided regarding the transformation zhai and zhang 2011 in practice a certain level of residual disinfectant is necessary in distribution systems of drinking water to inhibit the regrowth of microorganisms therefore such transformation of dbps in the presence of disinfectants can take place not only in the disinfection process of waters but also during the transportation of disinfected drinking waters indicating that these reactions may affect the dbp concentrations and overall toxicity of tap water it is also worth mentioning that monochloramine is widely used as a secondary disinfectant because it can persist longer than chlorine seidel et al 2005 suggesting that residual monochloramine possibly reacts with aromatic iodinated dbps for a relative long time in distribution systems since aromatic brominated dbps were able to act as intermediate dbps to form chlorinated and brominated thms and haas during chlorination it is likely that aromatic iodinated dbps can also undergo transformation to form iodinated thms and haas during chloramination hence it is practically significant to study the formation of iodinated thms and haas from aromatic iodinated dbps during chloramination thus in this study the formation of iodinated thms and haas from four aromatic iodinated dbps 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol during chloramination was investigated the purposes were 1 to study the decomposition kinetics of the aromatic iodinated dbps and the formation of iodinated thms and haas during chloramination 2 to explore the formation pathways of iodinated thms and haas from the aromatic iodinated dbps 3 to examine the effects of different factors on the formation of iodinated thms and haas from the aromatic iodinated dbps and 4 to evaluate the toxicity

stoichiometric amount of ascorbic acid was added after the contact times as the quenching agent gong et al 2016 duplicate samples were prepared for each set 2 3 sample pretreatment to quantify iodinated thms in a sample 50 ml of the sample was pretreated by liquid liquid extraction lle with mtbe according to the epa 551 1 method u s epa 1995 to determine the four aromatic iodinated dbps and

the intermediates in a sample 1 l of the sample was pretreated by lle with mtbe based on a previous method ding and zhang 2009 to test the cytotoxicity of a sample 3 l of the sample was preconcentrated using lle with mtbe according to a previous method yu et al 2016 the details of sample pretreatment are illustrated in the si section 3 2 4 instrumental analysis a gas chromatography system agilent 7890a was equipped with an electron capture detector to determine the iodinated thms a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system agilent 1260 was coupled by an electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometer esi tqms ab sciex api4000 to detect the polar iodinated dbps in this study the direct infusion precursor ion scan pis m z 126 9 was adopted to detect the polar iodinated compounds selectively and more detailed information of the pis mode is illustrated in the si section 4 to identify an unknown iodine containing molecular ion detected by the direct infusion pis m z 126 9 the retention time of the molecular ion was obtained through hplc ms ms multiple reaction monitoring mrm then product ion scans of the molecular ion were conducted at the specific retention time to obtain the fragment information to propose a structure finally the proposed structure was confirmed using the corresponding standard compound besides the mrm mode was also adopted to obtain the peak areas of the analytes based on which they could be quantified in addition due to the lack of the corresponding standard compound the identification of the ion with m z 241 in the samples was performed by a high resolution hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer ab sciex 5600 coupled with a hplc system agilent 1260 the full scan mode was adopted to obtain the accurate m z value of this ion and the product ion scan was performed to get its fragment information the detailed instrument parameters are elucidated in the si section 5 2 5 cytotoxicity test the cytotoxicity tests were performed using hepg2 cells based on a previous method yu et al 2016 the cells were cultivated in dmem at 37 c in a humidified atmosphere with 5 co2 in 96 well plates and the cell density was 104 cells well after 24 h of culture they were exposed to dmem containing the sample extracts or standard compounds the concentration factors of the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiodophenol samples used for the cytotoxicity test were 1500 938 750 469 375 235 117 59 29 and 15 after an exposure for 24 h cck 8 solution 10 μl was added into each well and then incubated for 1 h finally the number of cells in each well was determined based on its relative absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader tecan infinite m200 six replicates were determined the ec50 value was obtained by plotting the response curve using the graphpad prism 5 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 decomposition kinetics of the aromatic iodinated dbps and formation of iodinated thms and haas the molar concentrations of each aromatic iodinated dbp i e 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol and the formed iodinated thms and haas i e dcim tim miaa and diaa in the chloraminated samples with different contact times are demonstrated in fig 1 and si figs s1 s3 the original concentrations of the aromatic iodinated dbps were 100 μg l 2 4 6 triiodophenol 212 nm 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 267 nm 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid 256 nm 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol 256 nm as shown in fig 1a the concentration of 2 4 6 triiodophenol decreased sharply from 195 19 to 1 91 nm as the reaction time increased from 0 to 12 h and then kept stable when the reaction time further increased to 72 h the initial concentration of monochloramine was 30 mg l as cl2 422 μm which was highly excessive compared with those of the aromatic iodinated dbps therefore the monochloramine concentration was considered to be constant during chloramination as presented in fig 1d the 2 4 6 triiodophenol concentration followed a pseudo first order decay d c d t k c the integrated form is as follows l n c k t l n c 0 the regression was performed with the experimental data from 0 to 12 h as demonstrated in fig 1d l n c 0 29 t 15 16 the units of c and t are m and hour respectively thus the apparent rate constant k was 0 29 h 1 the results revealed that the decomposition of the other three aromatic iodinated dbps also followed a pseudo first order decay si figs s1 s3 the k values of 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxy benzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were calculated as 0 14 0 13 and 0 01 h 1 respectively hence the decomposition rate constant order of the four aromatic iodinated dbps during chloramination was 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol indicating that 2 4 6 triiodophenol was the most reactive while 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol was the least previously it has been reported that the nitro group deactivated electrophilic reactions of the benzene rings due to its strong electronegativity ju and parales 2010 to further clarify the relationship between the structures of these aromatic iodinated dbps and their decomposition rate constants the atomic charges of 2 6 diiodophenol the base compound 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid the isomer of 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were calculated using gaussian 09 software at the b3lyp 3 21g level si table s2 fig s4 sebastian and sundaraganesan 2010 a higher atomic charge value indicates a higher electrophilic or oxidative stability chen et al 2016 as shown in si table s2 the average atomic charges of the six carbons in the benzene ring of 2 6 diiodophenol 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were calculated to be 0 16 0 15 0 13 0 13 and 0 10 respectively revealing that these four substituting groups i e i cho cooh and no2 deactivated the benzene rings following the order of no2 cooh cho i which agreed with the decomposition rate constant order of the aromatic iodinated dbps as shown in fig 1b tim miaa and diaa were formed during the chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol while dcim was not detected in all the samples the concentrations of miaa and diaa increased significantly from 0 to 6 h i e from 0 to 0 12 nm and from 0 to 0 09 nm respectively and thereafter their concentrations kept increasing slightly until 72 h the concentration of tim increased from 0 to 8 37 nm when the reaction time increased from 0 to 24 h and afterwards declined slightly until 72 h the formation trends of tim and iodinated haas were generally in agreement with those in a previous study investigating the formation of tim and iodinated haas during chloramination of iodide containing waters liu et al 2017 based on the concentrations of the three products it was found that the formation of iodinated thms was much higher than that of iodinated haas during the chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol which was in accordance with a previous study reporting that the formation of tim was higher than that of iodinated haas during chloramination of iodide containing waters liu et al 2017 the molar conversion percentages from 2 4 6 triiodophenol to tim miaa and diaa were in the range of 0 4 3 0 0 07 and 0 0 05 respectively suggesting that besides these three products a certain amount of other products were also formed during the chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol similar results were obtained during the chloramination of the other three aromatic iodinated dbps si figs s1 s3 specifically the concentrations of iodinated thms and haas generated from 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol e g tim 0 0 52 nm were significantly lower than those from 2 4 6 triiodophenol tim 0 8 37 nm 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde tim 0 5 85 nm and 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid tim 0 8 40 nm possibly due to the following reasons 1 among the four aromatic iodinated dbps 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol had the lowest reactivity and decomposition rate constant k 0 01 h 1 during chloramination 2 some other products especially some nitrogenous dbps might be formed from 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol during chloramination thus reducing the formation of tim and iodinated haas previous studies have demonstrated that nitrogenous organic precursors easily generated nitrogenous dbps during disinfection such as haloacetonitriles and halonitromethanes yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 during chloramination these aromatic iodinated dbps underwent transformation to form iodinated thms haas and several other iodinated products to determine the iodine proportion of tim miaa and diaa the iodine transformation percentages from 2 4 6 triiodophenol to them at different contact times were calculated as follows i o d i n e t r a n s f o r m a t i o n p e r c e n t a g e c t i m 3 c m i a a c d i a a 2 195 c 2 4 6 t r i i o d o p h e n o l 3 the unit of c is nm and the detected initial concentration of 2 4 6 triiodophenol in the sample was 195 nm c2 4 6 triiodophenol ctim cmiaa and cdiaa were the detected concentrations of 2 4 6 triiodophenol tim miaa and diaa in the samples at different contact times i e 0 5 1 6 12 24 48 and 72 h respectively the iodine transformation percentages from 2 4 6 triiodophenol to tim miaa and diaa during chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol from 0 to 72 h are presented in fig 1c it first increased to 7 9 at 1 h and then declined to 3 1 at 6 h which kept relatively stable afterwards the reason might be that the concentration of 2 4 6 triiodophenol significantly decreased from 1 to 24 h resulting in increasing levels of the total transformed iodine and although the tim concentration kept increasing from 1 to 24 h the proportion of tim miaa and diaa in the total transformed iodine still decreased the iodine transformation percentages from the other three aromatic iodinated dbps to miaa diaa and tim were also calculated si figs s1 s3 the maximum iodine transformation percentages from 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol to miaa diaa and tim within 72 h were 3 4 5 0 and 1 2 respectively as elaborated above the decomposition rate constant of 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination was higher than those of the other three aromatic iodinated dbps and the maximum iodine transformation percentage from 2 4 6 triiodophenol to tim miaa and diaa within 72 h was also the largest among the four aromatic iodinated dbps previously it has been reported that 2 4 6 triiodophenol was widely present in disinfected drinking waters and saline wastewater effluents pan et al 2016 yang and zhang 2013 and it was relatively toxic among all iodinated dbps liu and zhang 2014 yang and zhang 2013 hence 2 4 6 triiodophenol was selected as a representative of the aromatic iodinated dbps for further investigation in this study 3 2 formation pathways of iodinated thms and haas from aromatic iodinated dbps during chloramination 3 2 1 identification of polar iodinated intermediates based on a previous method all electrospray ionizable iodine containing compounds are selectively detected by pis m z 126 9 using lc ms ms ding and zhang 2009 fig 2 presents the pis m z 126 9 spectrum of the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiodophenol sample besides the peak of 2 4 6 triiodophenol m z 471 several other peaks peak clusters showed up in the spectrum including m z 241 361 374 375 379 381 and 390 suggesting that some polar iodinated intermediates were formed during chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol in our previous study the ions with m z 374 379 381 and 390 have been identified as 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrosophenol 2 6 diiodo 4 chlorophenol and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol respectively gong et al 2017 in this study the ions with m z 361 and 375 in the pis m z 126 9 spectrum were fully identified and their structures are demonstrated in fig 2 the identification of the ion with m z 361 is elucidated as an example here fig 3 displays the mrm chromatogram of ion m z 361 in the sample fig 3b and its product ion scan spectrum fig 3e its long retention time 6 13 min suggested that this compound was likely to be aromatic zhai and zhang 2011 losses of 128 and 28 were observed in the product ion scan spectrum suggesting that this compound might contain at least one iodine atom one loss of 128 and one hydroxyl group on the benzene ring one loss of 28 after subtracting one benzene ring one hydroxyl group and one iodine atom from m z 361 the residual part was 143 which was proposed to be one iodine atom and one oxygen atom hence the ion with m z 361 was proposed to be 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone m h 2e or 2 6 diiodo 1 4 hydroquinone m h or their isomers notably the fragment ion with m z 233 fig 3e was also observed in the product ion scan spectrum of 2 3 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone in a previous study huang et al 2013 the standard solution of 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone was prepared to further confirm the structure fig 3 also presents the mrm chromatogram of 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone fig 3a the sample mixed with 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone fig 3c and the product ion scan spectrum of 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone fig 3d the retention time and product ion scan spectrum of the compound in the sample were the same as that of 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone confirming that the intermediate with m z 361 in the sample was 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone similarly the intermediate with m z 375 was identified as 2 6 diiodo 3 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone more details can be found in the si section 6 besides the ion with m z 241 was identified with a high resolution hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer coupled with a hplc as shown in si fig s6a the retention time of the ion with m z 240 90 was 0 84 min suggesting that this compound was likely to be aliphatic zhai and zhang 2011 formula finder in peakview software was adopted to explore its molecular formula and the result was c4h3o4i with a mass accuracy of 1 5 ppm to further determine its chemical structure product ion scan was conducted in the product ion scan spectrum si fig s6c the fragment ion peaks with m z 196 91 and 153 08 suggested sequential losses of co2 from m z 240 90 indicating the existence of two carboxyl groups in the compound with m z 240 90 moreover the fragment ion peak with m z 126 90 in the spectrum indicated that there was at least one i atom in this compound based on the above information the only rational structure of the compound with m z 241 should be iodobutenedioic acid which has been reported in drinking waters previously ding and zhang 2009 moreover 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone 2 6 diiodo 3 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone and iodobutenedioic acid were also detected and identified in chloraminated 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol samples si figs s7 s15 suggesting that tim miaa and diaa might be generated from the four aromatic iodinated dbps through similar pathways during chloramination 3 2 2 exploration of formation pathways based on the structures of the intermediates the formation pathways of tim miaa and diaa from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination were tentatively proposed fig 4 as shown in fig 4 2 4 6 triiodophenol underwent transformation to form 2 6 diiodo 4 aminophenol ⅰ 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrosophenol ⅱ and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol ⅲ during chloramination which has been successfully verified previously gong et al 2017 then 2 4 6 triiodophenol and ⅲ both transformed to 2 6 diiodo 1 4 hydroquinone ⅳ firstly and then to 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone ⅴ which was similar to the transformation of aromatic brominated dbps during chlorination zhai and zhang 2011 previously chlorinated and brominated benzoquinones were demonstrated to be unstable and easily transform to chlorinated and brominated hydroxybenzoquinones in waters especially under alkaline conditions qin et al 2010 wang et al 2014 hence 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone might rapidly transform to 2 6 diiodo 3 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone vi in previous studies chlorinated and brominated benzoquinones and hydroxybenzoquinones were demonstrated to be the intermediates before the cleavage of benzene rings during the decomposition of phenolic compounds in the presence of disinfectants nihemaiti et al 2017 zhai and zhang 2011 thus 2 6 diiodo 3 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone vi might also undergo benzene ring cleavage and then transform to generate tim and iodobutenedioic acid ⅹ via several hydroxylation and oxidation reactions notably ⅴ vi and ⅹ were all successfully detected and identified in the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiodophenol samples section 3 2 1 some aliphatic iodinated intermediates ⅶ ⅷ and ⅸ in the formation pathways were tentatively proposed but not detected in the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiodophenol samples possibly due to their low instrumental responses and stability finally miaa and diaa were generated from ⅹ during chloramination to validate the proposed formation pathways some additional experiments were performed first the concentrations of ⅲ and ⅴ as well as the mrm peak areas of the intermediates without commercial standard compounds ⅱ ⅵ and ⅹ in the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiodophenol samples with different contact times were determined si fig s16 the concentration of ⅹ increased continuously while those of the other intermediates first increased and then decreased over time which supported the proposed formation pathways because ⅹ was aliphatic while the other four were all aromatic second to verify the cleavage site of the benzene ring the molecular orbital calculations for vi were conducted using gaussian 09 software at the b3lyp 3 21g level si section 7 among the six carbon atoms in the benzene ring 4c and 5c si section 7 have larger 2fed2 homo values based on the frontier orbital theory atoms with larger 2fed2 homo values are probable attack points for electron extraction thus theoretically electrophilic reactions were more likely to occur at 4c and 5c which is in accordance with the reactions in the proposed pathways third the entropy δs enthalpy δh and gibbs free energy δg of the reactions in the proposed pathways were calculated using gaussian 09 software at the b3lyp 3 21g level as shown in si table s3 δg values at 20 c of all the reactions were below 0 kj mol 1 suggesting that all the reactions in the proposed pathways were favorable fourth chloramination of an important intermediate i e 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone ⅴ was performed the results revealed that higher concentrations of tim 0 33 78 nm miaa 0 0 32 nm and diaa 0 1 00 nm were generated during chloramination of 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone si fig s17b compared with that of 2 4 6 triiodophenol besides 2 6 diiodo 3 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone vi and iodobutenedioic acid ⅹ were both detected si fig s17c and identified si figs s18 s19 in chloraminated 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone samples all the results suggested that the proposed formation pathways were reasonable notably 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone was found to be an important intermediate during the formation of iodinated thms and haas from the four aromatic iodinated dbps in chloramination owing to the following reasons 1 it was formed during chloramination of all the four aromatic iodinated dbps 2 its concentrations 0 10 75 nm were relatively high during chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol si fig s16a 3 it was relatively unstable and decomposed rapidly during chloramination resulting in high formation of iodinated thms and haas si fig s17 3 3 factors affecting the formation of iodinated thms and haas from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination 3 3 1 monochloramine dose to clarify how monochloramine dose affected the formation of tim miaa and diaa during chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol the samples with different monochloramine doses i e 0 2 5 10 20 30 50 and 100 mg l as cl2 were prepared as shown in fig 5 a the 2 4 6 triiodophenol concentration decreased from 207 76 to 3 17 nm when the monochloramine dose increased from 0 to 100 mg l as cl2 indicating that higher monochloramine doses favored the decomposition of 2 4 6 triiodophenol in the proposed pathways reaction 1 would be enhanced with higher monochloramine doses previous studies have also demonstrated that several iodinated dbps decomposed at high monochloramine doses gong et al 2017 with the increasing monochloramine dose the concentrations of tim miaa and diaa first increased to a maximum and then kept stable or declined slightly it has been reported that more aliphatic dbps were generated with increasing the disinfectant dose during chlorination or chloramination chu et al 2017 hua and reckhow 2008 liu et al 2017 nihemaiti et al 2017 and thus the formation of tim miaa and diaa first increased with the increasing monochloramine dose but when the monochloramine dose further increased the dbp species might shift from being more iodinated to being more chlorinated liu et al 2017 and thus the formation of iodinated thms and haas slightly decreased 3 3 2 ph formation of tim miaa and diaa from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination was examined under different ph values i e 5 6 7 8 and 9 as displayed in fig 5b the 2 4 6 triiodophenol concentration increased continuously when the ph value increased from 5 to 9 suggesting that acidic conditions facilitated the decomposition of 2 4 6 triiodophenol possibly owing to the following reasons 1 monochloramine was more reactive because of its higher level of protonation at lower ph hua and reckhow 2008 2 at lower ph monochloramine might undergo disproportionation to form dichloramine which was more reactive than monochloramine hua and reckhow 2008 schreiber and mitch 2006 vikesland et al 2001 the formation of miaa and diaa did not significantly change with the increasing ph from 5 to 9 whereas the concentration of tim increased about 5 times i e from 1 67 to 9 55 nm previous studies have also demonstrated that alkaline conditions favored the formation of thms during chlorination or chloramination chu et al 2017 hua and reckhow 2008 liu et al 2017 since base catalyzed reactions played a crucial part in the formation of thms peters et al 1980 reckhow et al 1990 3 3 3 temperature formation of tim miaa and diaa from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination was examined with different temperatures i e 10 20 30 and 40 c the results are shown in fig 5c it can be found that the 2 4 6 triiodophenol concentration decreased when temperature increased but the concentrations of tim miaa and diaa increased continuously indicating that higher temperature facilitated the decomposition of 2 4 6 triiodophenol and the formation of tim miaa and diaa previously it was also reported that higher temperature accelerated the decomposition of aromatic iodinated dbps and the formation of thms and haas gong et al 2017 hua and reckhow 2008 3 3 4 short free chlorine contact time monochloramine is widely adopted as a secondary disinfectant in distribution systems of drinking water because of its high stability seidel et al 2005 in practice chlorine and ammonia are usually dosed at different locations in water treatment plants allowing for a short free chlorine contact time in this study the influence of short free chlorine contact time was evaluated before chloramination and the results are presented in fig 5d the 2 4 6 triiodophenol concentration decreased when free chlorine contact time increased from 0 to 60 min suggesting that short chlorination before chloramination promoted the decomposition of 2 4 6 triiodophenol the concentrations of tim and diaa kept decreasing when the free chlorine contact time increased from 0 to 60 min while the concentration of miaa first decreased when the free chlorine contact time increased from 0 to 15 min and then kept relatively stable until 60 min it was possibly owing to the reason that a certain amount of 2 4 6 triiodophenol was transformed to chlorinated intermediates during chlorination or a certain amount of iodine in 2 4 6 triiodophenol was released and then oxidized to iodate during chlorination wendel et al 2014 previously it has been reported that the formation of iodinated thms was more favorable in preformed monochloramine disinfection as compared to prechlorination followed by ammonia addition jones et al 2011 3 4 toxicity change in this study it was found that iodinated thms and haas were generated from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination the toxicity of the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiodophenol sample might also change during the transformation thus the comparative cytotoxicity of the eight iodinated dbps as well as the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiodophenol samples with different contact times was evaluated using hepg2 cells the response curves for the tested iodinated dbps are shown in fig 6 a and the ec50 values of tim miaa diaa 2 4 6 triiodophenol 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde and 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid were calculated to be 1609 12 395 151 182 79 962 and 400 μm respectively hence the cytotoxicity rank order of the tested iodinated dbps was miaa 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol 2 4 6 triiodophenol 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone diaa 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde tim previously it was also reported that the cytotoxicity of miaa was higher than that of diaa sayess et al 2017 the high toxicity of miaa was related to its lipophilicity and electrophilic reactivity plewa et al 2004 moreover the toxicity order of the four aromatic iodinated dbps was in line with that in previous studies gong et al 2017 yang and zhang 2013 among the four aromatic iodinated dbps 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol was of the highest cytotoxicity possibly due to the existence of the nitro group in 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol richardson et al 2007 moreover the cytotoxicity of the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiodophenol samples at 0 0 5 1 6 12 24 48 and 72 h are presented in fig 6b and their ec50 values were calculated as 411 441 446 478 347 272 72 and 83 concentration factor respectively suggesting that the cytotoxicity of the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiiodophenol sample first decreased 0 6 h and then increased 6 72 h over time spearman s correlation analysis was adopted to examine the correlation between the ec50 values and the concentrations or peak areas of all detectable products fig 1 and si fig s16 at different contact times and the results are shown in si table s4 because 6 h seemed to be an important turning point of the reaction based on the concentration and toxicity results the correlation analysis was conducted for the data of 0 6 h and 6 72 h respectively the results revealed that from 0 to 6 h the ec50 value was negatively correlated with the 2 4 6 triiodophenol concentration suggesting that the cytotoxicity was positively correlated with the 2 4 6 triiodophenol concentration besides from 0 to 6 h the concentration of 2 4 6 triiodophenol was in the range of 71 0 195 2 nm which was much higher than those of the other detectable products thus the cytotoxicity of the sample might be predominantly attributed to 2 4 6 triiodophenol before 6 h however from 6 to 72 h the ec50 value was negatively correlated with the miaa concentration suggesting that the cytotoxicity was positively correlated with the miaa concentration therefore miaa might partly contribute to the increasing toxicity of the sample after 6 h but due to the low concentrations of miaa its contribution to the toxicity of the sample should be limited some other products might be formed after 6 h which made a significant contribution to the increasing toxicity of the sample 4 conclusions in this study it was found that tim miaa and diaa were generated from four aromatic iodinated dbps 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol during chloramination indicating that aromatic iodinated dbps might act as intermediate dbps to generate aliphatic iodinated dbps during chloramination the decomposition of the aromatic iodinated dbps all followed a pseudo first order decay during chloramination and the decomposition rate constant order was as follows 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol several polar iodinated intermediates were detected and identified e g 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone and iodobutenedioic acid during chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol based on which the formation pathways of tim miaa and diaa from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination were proposed and further validated the results also demonstrated that monochloramine dose ph temperature and short free chlorine contact time affected the formation of tim miaa and diaa from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination the cytotoxicity order of the eight iodinated dbps was miaa 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol 2 4 6 triiodophenol 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone diaa 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde tim the toxicity of the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiiodophenol sample first decreased and then increased over time due to the transformation indicating that chloraminated waters with long reaction times may need to be concerned owing to the increasing toxicity further investigation regarding the transformation of different iodine species and the formation of other iodinated products during this process may need to be conducted to figure out the products which made a significant contribution to the increasing toxicity acknowledgement this work was supported by the

19248,iodinated disinfection byproducts dbps are widely present in disinfected drinking waters and wastewater effluents and they have drawn increasing concern owing to their high toxicity to date the reported iodinated dbps mainly include aliphatic and aromatic ones and iodinated trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are the most commonly detected aliphatic iodinated dbps in disinfected waters in this study the formation of iodinated thms and haas from aromatic iodinated dbps during chloramination was investigated the decomposition kinetics of the aromatic iodinated dbps and the formation of iodinated thms and haas were studied the formation pathways of iodinated thms and haas from the aromatic iodinated dbps were explored the factors affecting the formation were examined and the toxicity change was evaluated the results revealed that four aromatic iodinated dbps 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol all underwent transformation to form triiodomethane tim monoiodoacetic acid miaa and diiodoacetic acid diaa during chloramination the decomposition of the aromatic iodinated dbps all followed a pseudo first order decay during chloramination and the rank order of the decomposition rate constants was as follows 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol several polar iodinated intermediates were detected and identified e g 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone and iodobutenedioic acid during chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol based on which the formation pathways of tim miaa and diaa from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination were proposed and further validated the results also revealed that monochloramine dose ph temperature and short free chlorine contact time all affected the formation of tim miaa and diaa from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination the cytotoxicity order of the eight iodinated dbps was miaa 2 6 diiodo 4

decreased and then increased over time due to the transformation graphical abstract image 1 keywords dbps iodinated dbps aromatic iodinated dbps iodinated thms iodinated haas chloramination 1 introduction iodide widely exists in source waters and wastewater effluents 0 4 104 2 μg l gong and zhang 2013 richardson et al 2008 and it can be oxidized to hoi during water disinfection hoi can further react with organic matter in waters to form iodinated disinfection byproducts dbps bichsel and von gunten 2000 which have been demonstrated to be significantly more toxic than their chlorinated and or brominated analogues liu and zhang 2014 plewa et al 2004 therefore iodinated dbps have drawn increasing concern recently iodinated dbps have been reported to be widely present in disinfected waters predominantly including two categories aliphatic ones and aromatic ones pan et al 2016 plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2008 yang and zhang 2013 to date the reported aliphatic iodinated dbps mainly comprise iodinated trihalomethanes thms iodinated aliphatic acids and iodinated haloacetamides chu et al 2012 plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2008 while the reported aromatic iodinated dbps are mainly classified into four groups based on the structures iodinated phenols iodinated hydroxybenzaldehydes iodinated hydroxybenzoic acids and iodinated nitrophenols pan et al 2016 yang and zhang 2013 recently more and more water utilities have switched from chlorination to chloramination or a combination of them to control the concentrations of regulated thms and haloacetic acids haas richardson et al 2008 seidel et al 2005 however higher occurrence frequencies and levels of iodinated dbps were generated in chloraminated drinking waters compared with chlorinated ones hua and reckhow 2007 chlorinated and brominated thms and haas are two major classes of organic dbps regulated by u s epa richardson et al 2007 since iodinated thms and haas are significantly more toxic than their chlorinated and or brominated analogues liu and zhang 2014 plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2007 and are commonly present in chloraminated drinking waters hu et al 2018 pan et al 2016 they may become regulated dbps in the future moreover triiodomethane tim could result in odor problems with a low concentration threshold of 0 02 μg l cancho et al 2000 thus iodinated thms and haas may need to be specifically concerned besides the newly identified aromatic iodinated dbps also received much attention owing to their wide occurrence and high toxicity among them 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were of higher occurrence frequencies and levels than other aromatic iodinated dbps in disinfected waters pan et al 2016 yang and zhang 2013 thus the investigation concerning iodinated thms and haas as well as the four aromatic iodinated dbps may be critical for water quality control previously it has been reported that some dbps further reacted with disinfectants to undergo transformation and decomposition to form other dbps for example 4 iodophenol transformed to 2 4 6 triiodophenol and further to 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol during chloramination gong et al 2017 in another previous study it was demonstrated that some aromatic brominated dbps transformed to other halogenated dbps including chlorinated and brominated thms and haas during chlorination however the transformation pathways were not thoroughly studied and few quantitative data were provided regarding the transformation zhai and zhang 2011 in practice a certain level of residual disinfectant is necessary in distribution systems of drinking water to inhibit the regrowth of microorganisms therefore such transformation of dbps in the presence of disinfectants can take place not only in the disinfection process of waters but also during the transportation of disinfected drinking waters indicating that these reactions may affect the dbp concentrations and overall toxicity of tap water it is also worth mentioning that monochloramine is widely used as a secondary disinfectant because it can persist longer than chlorine seidel et al 2005 suggesting that residual monochloramine possibly reacts with aromatic iodinated dbps for a relative long time in distribution systems since aromatic brominated dbps were able to act as intermediate dbps to form chlorinated and brominated thms and haas during chlorination it is likely that aromatic iodinated dbps can also undergo transformation to form iodinated thms and haas during chloramination hence it is practically significant to study the formation of iodinated thms and haas from aromatic iodinated dbps during chloramination thus in this study the formation of iodinated thms and haas from four aromatic iodinated dbps 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol during chloramination was investigated the purposes were 1 to study the decomposition kinetics of the aromatic iodinated dbps and the formation of iodinated thms and haas during chloramination 2 to explore the formation pathways of iodinated thms and haas from the aromatic iodinated dbps 3 to examine the effects of different factors on the formation of iodinated thms and haas from the aromatic iodinated dbps and 4 to evaluate the toxicity

nitrophenol during chloramination one set of chloraminated samples were prepared for each aromatic iodinated dbp with different contact times i e 0 0 5 1 6 12 24 48 and 72 h for each set eight aliquots 280 ml of a solution containing 100 μg l of an aromatic iodinated dbp were prepared chloramination was performed at ph 8 at 20 c with a monochloramine dose of 30 mg l as cl2 in this study the excessive monochloramine dose was adopted to better determine the decomposition kinetics of the aromatic iodinated dbps and the formation of the iodinated thms and haas to further validate the

iodinated thms in a sample 50 ml of the sample was pretreated by liquid liquid extraction lle with mtbe according to the epa 551 1 method u s epa 1995 to determine the four aromatic iodinated dbps and

preconcentrated using lle with mtbe according to a previous method yu et al 2016 the details of sample pretreatment are illustrated in the si section 3 2 4 instrumental analysis a gas chromatography system agilent 7890a was equipped with an electron capture detector to determine the iodinated thms a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system agilent 1260 was coupled by an electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometer esi tqms ab sciex api4000 to detect the polar iodinated dbps in this study the direct infusion precursor ion scan pis m z 126 9 was adopted to detect the polar iodinated compounds selectively and more detailed information of the pis mode is illustrated in the si section 4 to identify an unknown iodine containing molecular ion detected by the direct infusion pis m z 126 9 the retention time of the molecular ion was obtained through hplc ms ms multiple reaction monitoring mrm then product ion scans of the molecular ion were conducted at the specific retention time to obtain the fragment information to propose a structure finally the proposed structure was confirmed using the corresponding standard compound besides the mrm mode was also adopted to obtain the peak areas of the analytes based on which they could be quantified in addition due to the lack of the corresponding standard compound the identification of the ion with m z 241 in the samples was performed by a high resolution hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer ab sciex 5600 coupled with a hplc system agilent 1260 the full scan mode was adopted to obtain the accurate m z value of this ion and the product ion scan was performed to get its fragment information the detailed instrument parameters are elucidated in the si section 5 2 5 cytotoxicity test the cytotoxicity tests were performed using hepg2 cells based on a previous method yu et al 2016 the cells were cultivated in dmem at 37 c in a humidified atmosphere with 5 co2 in 96 well plates and the cell density was 104 cells well after 24 h of culture they were exposed to dmem containing the sample extracts or standard compounds the concentration factors of the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiodophenol samples used for the cytotoxicity test were 1500 938 750 469 375 235 117 59 29 and 15 after an exposure for 24 h cck 8 solution 10 μl was added into each well and then incubated for 1 h finally the number of cells in each well was determined based on its relative absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader tecan infinite m200 six replicates were determined the ec50 value was obtained by plotting the response curve using the graphpad prism 5 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 decomposition kinetics of the aromatic iodinated dbps and formation of iodinated thms and haas the molar concentrations of each aromatic iodinated dbp i e 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol and the formed iodinated thms and haas i e dcim tim miaa and diaa in the chloraminated samples with different contact times are demonstrated in fig 1 and si figs s1 s3 the original concentrations of the aromatic iodinated dbps were 100 μg l 2 4 6 triiodophenol 212 nm 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 267 nm 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid 256 nm 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol 256 nm as shown in fig 1a the concentration of 2 4 6 triiodophenol decreased sharply from 195 19 to 1 91 nm as the reaction time increased from 0 to 12 h and then kept stable when the reaction time further increased to 72 h the initial concentration of monochloramine was 30 mg l as cl2 422 μm which was highly excessive compared with those of the aromatic iodinated dbps therefore the monochloramine concentration was considered to be constant during chloramination as presented in fig 1d the 2 4 6 triiodophenol concentration followed a pseudo first order decay d c d t k c the integrated form is as follows l n c k t l n c 0 the regression was performed with the experimental data from 0 to 12 h as demonstrated in fig 1d l n c 0 29 t 15 16 the units of c and t are m and hour respectively thus the apparent rate constant k was 0 29 h 1 the results revealed that the decomposition of the other three aromatic iodinated dbps also followed a pseudo first order decay si figs s1 s3 the k values of 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxy benzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were calculated as 0 14 0 13 and 0 01 h 1 respectively hence the decomposition rate constant order of the four aromatic iodinated dbps during chloramination was 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol indicating that 2 4 6 triiodophenol was the most reactive while 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol was the least previously it has been reported that the nitro group deactivated electrophilic reactions of the benzene rings due to its strong electronegativity ju and parales 2010 to further clarify the relationship between the structures of these aromatic iodinated dbps and their decomposition rate constants the atomic charges of 2 6 diiodophenol the base compound 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid the isomer of 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were calculated using gaussian 09 software at the b3lyp 3 21g level si table s2 fig s4 sebastian and sundaraganesan 2010 a higher atomic charge value indicates a higher electrophilic or oxidative stability chen et al 2016 as shown in si table s2 the average atomic charges of the six carbons in the benzene ring of 2 6 diiodophenol 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were calculated to be 0 16 0 15 0 13 0 13 and 0 10 respectively revealing that these four substituting groups i e i cho cooh and no2 deactivated the benzene rings following the order of no2 cooh cho i which agreed with the decomposition rate constant order of the aromatic iodinated dbps as shown in fig 1b tim miaa and diaa were formed during the chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol while dcim was not detected in all the samples the concentrations of miaa and diaa increased significantly from 0 to 6 h i e from 0 to 0 12 nm and from 0 to 0 09 nm respectively and thereafter their concentrations kept increasing slightly until 72 h the concentration of tim increased from 0 to 8 37 nm when the reaction time increased from 0 to 24 h and afterwards declined slightly until 72 h the formation trends of tim and iodinated haas were generally in agreement with those in a previous study investigating the formation of tim and iodinated haas during chloramination of iodide containing waters liu et al 2017 based on the concentrations of the three products it was found that the formation of iodinated thms was much higher than that of iodinated haas during the chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol which was in accordance with a previous study reporting that the formation of tim was higher than that of iodinated haas during chloramination of iodide containing waters liu et al 2017 the molar conversion percentages from 2 4 6 triiodophenol to tim miaa and diaa were in the range of 0 4 3 0 0 07 and 0 0 05 respectively suggesting that besides these three products a certain amount of other products were also formed during the chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol similar results were obtained during the chloramination of the other three aromatic iodinated dbps si figs s1 s3 specifically the concentrations of iodinated thms and haas generated from 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol e g tim 0 0 52 nm were significantly lower than those from 2 4 6 triiodophenol tim 0 8 37 nm 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde tim 0 5 85 nm and 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid tim 0 8 40 nm possibly due to the following reasons 1 among the four aromatic iodinated dbps 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol had the lowest reactivity and decomposition rate constant k 0 01 h 1 during chloramination 2 some other products especially some nitrogenous dbps might be formed from 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol during chloramination thus reducing the formation of tim and iodinated haas previous studies have demonstrated that nitrogenous organic precursors easily generated nitrogenous dbps during disinfection such as haloacetonitriles and halonitromethanes yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 during chloramination these aromatic iodinated dbps underwent transformation to form iodinated thms haas and several other iodinated products to determine the iodine proportion of tim miaa and diaa the iodine transformation percentages from 2 4 6 triiodophenol to them at different contact times were calculated as follows i o d i n e t r a n s f o r m a t i o n p e r c e n t a g e c t i m 3 c m i a a c d i a a 2 195 c 2 4 6 t r i i o d o p h e n o l 3 the unit of c is nm and the detected initial concentration of 2 4 6 triiodophenol in the sample was 195 nm c2 4 6 triiodophenol ctim cmiaa and cdiaa were the detected concentrations of 2 4 6 triiodophenol tim miaa and diaa in the samples at different contact times i e 0 5 1 6 12 24 48 and 72 h respectively the iodine transformation percentages from 2 4 6 triiodophenol to tim miaa and diaa during chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol from 0 to 72 h are presented in fig 1c it first increased to 7 9 at 1 h and then declined to 3 1 at 6 h which kept relatively stable afterwards the reason might be that the concentration of 2 4 6 triiodophenol significantly decreased from 1 to 24 h resulting in increasing levels of the total transformed iodine and although the tim concentration kept increasing from 1 to 24 h the proportion of tim miaa and diaa in the total transformed iodine still decreased the iodine transformation percentages from the other three aromatic iodinated dbps to miaa diaa and tim were also calculated si figs s1 s3 the maximum iodine transformation percentages from 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol to miaa diaa and tim within 72 h were 3 4 5 0 and 1 2 respectively as elaborated above the decomposition rate constant of 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination was higher than those of the other three aromatic iodinated dbps and the maximum iodine transformation percentage from 2 4 6 triiodophenol to tim miaa and diaa within 72 h was also the largest among the four aromatic iodinated dbps previously it has been reported that 2 4 6 triiodophenol was widely present in disinfected drinking waters and saline wastewater effluents pan et al 2016 yang and zhang 2013 and it was relatively toxic among all iodinated dbps liu and zhang 2014 yang and zhang 2013 hence 2 4 6 triiodophenol was selected as a representative of the aromatic iodinated dbps for further investigation in this study 3 2 formation pathways of iodinated thms and haas from aromatic iodinated dbps during chloramination 3 2 1 identification of polar iodinated intermediates based on a previous method all electrospray ionizable iodine containing compounds are selectively detected by pis m z 126 9 using lc ms ms ding and zhang 2009 fig 2 presents the pis m z 126 9 spectrum of the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiodophenol sample besides the peak of 2 4 6 triiodophenol m z 471 several other peaks peak clusters showed up in the spectrum including m z 241 361 374 375 379 381 and 390 suggesting that some polar iodinated intermediates were formed during chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol in our previous study the ions with m z 374 379 381 and 390 have been identified as 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrosophenol 2 6 diiodo 4 chlorophenol and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol respectively gong et al 2017 in this study the ions with m z 361 and 375 in the pis m z 126 9 spectrum were fully identified and their structures are demonstrated in fig 2 the identification of the ion with m z 361 is elucidated as an example here fig 3 displays the mrm chromatogram of ion m z 361 in the sample fig 3b and its product ion scan spectrum fig 3e its long retention time 6 13 min suggested that this compound was likely to be aromatic zhai and zhang 2011 losses of 128 and 28 were observed in the product ion scan spectrum suggesting that this compound might contain at least one iodine atom one loss of 128 and one hydroxyl group on the benzene ring one loss of 28 after subtracting one benzene ring one hydroxyl group and one iodine atom from m z 361 the residual part was 143 which was proposed to be one iodine atom and one oxygen atom hence the ion with m z 361 was proposed to be 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone m h 2e or 2 6 diiodo 1 4 hydroquinone m h or their isomers notably the fragment ion with m z 233 fig 3e was also observed in the product ion scan spectrum of 2 3 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone in a previous study huang et al 2013 the standard solution of 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone was prepared to further confirm the structure fig 3 also presents the mrm chromatogram of 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone fig 3a the sample mixed with 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone fig 3c and the product ion scan spectrum of 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone fig 3d the retention time and product ion scan spectrum of the compound in the sample were the same as that of 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone confirming that the intermediate with m z 361 in the sample was 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone similarly the intermediate with m z 375 was identified as 2 6 diiodo 3 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone more details can be found in the si section 6 besides the ion with m z 241 was identified with a high resolution hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer coupled with a hplc as shown in si fig s6a the retention time of the ion with m z 240 90 was 0 84 min suggesting that this compound was likely to be aliphatic zhai and zhang 2011 formula finder in peakview software was adopted to explore its molecular formula and the result was c4h3o4i with a mass accuracy of 1 5 ppm to further determine its chemical structure product ion scan was conducted in the product ion scan spectrum si fig s6c the fragment ion peaks with m z 196 91 and 153 08 suggested sequential losses of co2 from m z 240 90 indicating the existence of two carboxyl groups in the compound with m z 240 90 moreover the fragment ion peak with m z 126 90 in the spectrum indicated that there was at least one i atom in this compound based on the above information the only rational structure of the compound with m z 241 should be iodobutenedioic acid which has been reported in drinking waters previously ding and zhang 2009 moreover 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone 2 6 diiodo 3 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone and iodobutenedioic acid were also detected and identified in chloraminated 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol samples si figs s7 s15 suggesting that tim miaa and diaa might be generated from the four aromatic iodinated dbps through similar pathways during chloramination 3 2 2 exploration of formation pathways based on the structures of the intermediates the formation pathways of tim miaa and diaa from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination were tentatively proposed fig 4 as shown in fig 4 2 4 6 triiodophenol underwent transformation to form 2 6 diiodo 4 aminophenol ⅰ 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrosophenol ⅱ and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol ⅲ during chloramination which has been successfully verified previously gong et al 2017 then 2 4 6 triiodophenol and ⅲ both transformed to 2 6 diiodo 1 4 hydroquinone ⅳ firstly and then to 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone ⅴ which was similar to the transformation of aromatic brominated dbps during chlorination zhai and zhang 2011 previously chlorinated and brominated benzoquinones were demonstrated to be unstable and easily transform to chlorinated and brominated hydroxybenzoquinones in waters especially under alkaline conditions qin et al 2010 wang et al 2014 hence 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone might rapidly transform to 2 6 diiodo 3 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone vi in previous studies chlorinated and brominated benzoquinones and hydroxybenzoquinones were demonstrated to be the intermediates before the cleavage of benzene rings during the decomposition of phenolic compounds in the presence of disinfectants nihemaiti et al 2017 zhai and zhang 2011 thus 2 6 diiodo 3 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone vi might also undergo benzene ring cleavage and then transform to generate tim and iodobutenedioic acid ⅹ via several hydroxylation and oxidation reactions notably ⅴ vi and ⅹ were all successfully detected and identified in the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiodophenol samples section 3 2 1 some aliphatic iodinated intermediates ⅶ ⅷ and ⅸ in the formation pathways were tentatively proposed but not detected in the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiodophenol samples possibly due to their low instrumental responses and stability finally miaa and diaa were generated from ⅹ during chloramination to validate the proposed formation pathways some additional experiments were performed first the concentrations of ⅲ and ⅴ as well as the mrm peak areas of the intermediates without commercial standard compounds ⅱ ⅵ and ⅹ in the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiodophenol samples with different contact times were determined si fig s16 the concentration of ⅹ increased continuously while those of the other intermediates first increased and then decreased over time which supported the proposed formation pathways because ⅹ was aliphatic while the other four were all aromatic second to verify the cleavage site of the benzene ring the molecular orbital calculations for vi were conducted using gaussian 09 software at the b3lyp 3 21g level si section 7 among the six carbon atoms in the benzene ring 4c and 5c si section 7 have larger 2fed2 homo values based on the frontier orbital theory atoms with larger 2fed2 homo values are probable attack points for electron extraction thus theoretically electrophilic reactions were more likely to occur at 4c and 5c which is in accordance with the reactions in the proposed pathways third the entropy δs enthalpy δh and gibbs free energy δg of the reactions in the proposed pathways were calculated using gaussian 09 software at the b3lyp 3 21g level as shown in si table s3 δg values at 20 c of all the reactions were below 0 kj mol 1 suggesting that all the reactions in the proposed pathways were favorable fourth chloramination of an important intermediate i e 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone ⅴ was performed the results revealed that higher concentrations of tim 0 33 78 nm miaa 0 0 32 nm and diaa 0 1 00 nm were generated during chloramination of 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone si fig s17b compared with that of 2 4 6 triiodophenol besides 2 6 diiodo 3 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone vi and iodobutenedioic acid ⅹ were both detected si fig s17c and identified si figs s18 s19 in chloraminated 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone samples all the results suggested that the proposed formation pathways were reasonable notably 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone was found to be an important intermediate during the formation of iodinated thms and haas from the four aromatic iodinated dbps in chloramination owing to the following reasons 1 it was formed during chloramination of all the four aromatic iodinated dbps 2 its concentrations 0 10 75 nm were relatively high during chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol si fig s16a 3 it was relatively unstable and decomposed rapidly during chloramination resulting in high formation of iodinated thms and haas si fig s17 3 3 factors affecting the formation of iodinated thms and haas from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination 3 3 1 monochloramine dose to clarify how monochloramine dose affected the formation of tim miaa and diaa during chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol the samples with different monochloramine doses i e 0 2 5 10 20 30 50 and 100 mg l as cl2 were prepared as shown in fig 5 a the 2 4 6 triiodophenol concentration decreased from 207 76 to 3 17 nm when the monochloramine dose increased from 0 to 100 mg l as cl2 indicating that higher monochloramine doses favored the decomposition of 2 4 6 triiodophenol in the proposed pathways reaction 1 would be enhanced with higher monochloramine doses previous studies have also demonstrated that several iodinated dbps decomposed at high monochloramine doses gong et al 2017 with the increasing monochloramine dose the concentrations of tim miaa and diaa first increased to a maximum and then kept stable or declined slightly it has been reported that more aliphatic dbps were generated with increasing the disinfectant dose during chlorination or chloramination chu et al 2017 hua and reckhow 2008 liu et al 2017 nihemaiti et al 2017 and thus the formation of tim miaa and diaa first increased with the increasing monochloramine dose but when the monochloramine dose further increased the dbp species might shift from being more iodinated to being more chlorinated liu et al 2017 and thus the formation of iodinated thms and haas slightly decreased 3 3 2 ph formation of tim miaa and diaa from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination was examined under different ph values i e 5 6 7 8 and 9 as displayed in fig 5b the 2 4 6 triiodophenol concentration increased continuously when the ph value increased from 5 to 9 suggesting that acidic conditions facilitated the decomposition of 2 4 6 triiodophenol possibly owing to the following reasons 1 monochloramine was more reactive because of its higher level of protonation at lower ph hua and reckhow 2008 2 at lower ph monochloramine might undergo disproportionation to form dichloramine which was more reactive than monochloramine hua and reckhow 2008 schreiber and mitch 2006 vikesland et al 2001 the formation of miaa and diaa did not significantly change with the increasing ph from 5 to 9 whereas the concentration of tim increased about 5 times i e from 1 67 to 9 55 nm previous studies have also demonstrated that alkaline conditions favored the formation of thms during chlorination or chloramination chu et al 2017 hua and reckhow 2008 liu et al 2017 since base catalyzed reactions played a crucial part in the formation of thms peters et al 1980 reckhow et al 1990 3 3 3 temperature formation of tim miaa and diaa from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination was examined with different temperatures i e 10 20 30 and 40 c the results are shown in fig 5c it can be found that the 2 4 6 triiodophenol concentration decreased when temperature increased but the concentrations of tim miaa and diaa increased continuously indicating that higher temperature facilitated the decomposition of 2 4 6 triiodophenol and the formation of tim miaa and diaa previously it was also reported that higher temperature accelerated the decomposition of aromatic iodinated dbps and the formation of thms and haas gong et al 2017 hua and reckhow 2008 3 3 4 short free chlorine contact time monochloramine is widely adopted as a secondary disinfectant in distribution systems of drinking water because of its high stability seidel et al 2005 in practice chlorine and ammonia are usually dosed at different locations in water treatment plants allowing for a short free chlorine contact time in this study the influence of short free chlorine contact time was evaluated before chloramination and the results are presented in fig 5d the 2 4 6 triiodophenol concentration decreased when free chlorine contact time increased from 0 to 60 min suggesting that short chlorination before chloramination promoted the decomposition of 2 4 6 triiodophenol the concentrations of tim and diaa kept decreasing when the free chlorine contact time increased from 0 to 60 min while the concentration of miaa first decreased when the free chlorine contact time increased from 0 to 15 min and then kept relatively stable until 60 min it was possibly owing to the reason that a certain amount of 2 4 6 triiodophenol was transformed to chlorinated intermediates during chlorination or a certain amount of iodine in 2 4 6 triiodophenol was released and then oxidized to iodate during chlorination wendel et al 2014 previously it has been reported that the formation of iodinated thms was more favorable in preformed monochloramine disinfection as compared to prechlorination followed by ammonia addition jones et al 2011 3 4 toxicity change in this study it was found that iodinated thms and haas were generated from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination the toxicity of the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiodophenol sample might also change during the transformation thus the comparative cytotoxicity of the eight iodinated dbps as well as the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiodophenol samples with different contact times was evaluated using hepg2 cells the response curves for the tested iodinated dbps are shown in fig 6 a and the ec50 values of tim miaa diaa 2 4 6 triiodophenol 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde and 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid were calculated to be 1609 12 395 151 182 79 962 and 400 μm respectively hence the cytotoxicity rank order of the tested iodinated dbps was miaa 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol 2 4 6 triiodophenol 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone diaa 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde tim previously it was also reported that the cytotoxicity of miaa was higher than that of diaa sayess et al 2017 the high toxicity of miaa was related to its lipophilicity and electrophilic reactivity plewa et al 2004 moreover the toxicity order of the four aromatic iodinated dbps was in line with that in previous studies gong et al 2017 yang and zhang 2013 among the four aromatic iodinated dbps 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol was of the highest cytotoxicity possibly due to the existence of the nitro group in 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol richardson et al 2007 moreover the cytotoxicity of the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiodophenol samples at 0 0 5 1 6 12 24 48 and 72 h are presented in fig 6b and their ec50 values were calculated as 411 441 446 478 347 272 72 and 83 concentration factor respectively suggesting that the cytotoxicity of the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiiodophenol sample first decreased 0 6 h and then increased 6 72 h over time spearman s correlation analysis was adopted to examine the correlation between the ec50 values and the concentrations or peak areas of all detectable products fig 1 and si fig s16 at different contact times and the results are shown in si table s4 because 6 h seemed to be an important turning point of the reaction based on the concentration and toxicity results the correlation analysis was conducted for the data of 0 6 h and 6 72 h respectively the results revealed that from 0 to 6 h the ec50 value was negatively correlated with the 2 4 6 triiodophenol concentration suggesting that the cytotoxicity was positively correlated with the 2 4 6 triiodophenol concentration besides from 0 to 6 h the concentration of 2 4 6 triiodophenol was in the range of 71 0 195 2 nm which was much higher than those of the other detectable products thus the cytotoxicity of the sample might be predominantly attributed to 2 4 6 triiodophenol before 6 h however from 6 to 72 h the ec50 value was negatively correlated with the miaa concentration suggesting that the cytotoxicity was positively correlated with the miaa concentration therefore miaa might partly contribute to the increasing toxicity of the sample after 6 h but due to the low concentrations of miaa its contribution to the toxicity of the sample should be limited some other products might be formed after 6 h which made a significant contribution to the increasing toxicity of the sample 4 conclusions in this study it was found that tim miaa and diaa were generated from four aromatic iodinated dbps 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol during chloramination indicating that aromatic iodinated dbps might act as intermediate dbps to generate aliphatic iodinated dbps during chloramination the decomposition of the aromatic iodinated dbps all followed a pseudo first order decay during chloramination and the decomposition rate constant order was as follows 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol several polar iodinated intermediates were detected and identified e g 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone and iodobutenedioic acid during chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol based on which the formation pathways of tim miaa and diaa from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination were proposed and further validated the results also demonstrated that monochloramine dose ph temperature and short free chlorine contact time affected the formation of tim miaa and diaa from 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chloramination the cytotoxicity order of the eight iodinated dbps was miaa 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol 2 4 6 triiodophenol 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone diaa 3 5 diiodosalicylic acid 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde tim the toxicity of the chloraminated 2 4 6 triiiodophenol sample first decreased and then increased over time due to the transformation indicating that chloraminated waters with long reaction times may need to be concerned owing to the increasing toxicity further investigation regarding the transformation of different iodine species and the formation of other iodinated products during this process may need to be conducted to figure out the products which made a significant contribution to the increasing toxicity acknowledgement this work was supported by the

19249,in order to attain a high efficiency and low cost adsorbent for both arsenate as v and arsenite as iii removal from as contaminated water a novel nanostructured fe ti mn composite oxide ftmo was fabricated through a one step simultaneous oxidation and co precipitation method batch control experiments and series of spectroscopy detection technologies were carried out to investigate the surface change of the ftmo adsorbent and the respective role of fe ti and mn content in the arsenic adsorption process the results showed that the ftmo adsorbent had a high adsorption capacity for both as v and as iii especially for the latter one via the formation of inner sphere complexes at the water oxide interface under both darkness and light conditions the material could effectively oxidize as iii to as v and light illumination could further apparently enhance the as iii oxidation thus achieving high adsorption efficiency of as iii combined with the characterizations from ftir esr and xps it was assumed that the predominant as iii removal mechanism could be attributed to the coupling of various processes including photooxidation oxidation and adsorption the ti and mn contents were dominant for the as iii oxidation while the fe content mainly played an important role for the adsorption of newly formed as v however the involvement of surface hydroxyl groups and the formation of inner sphere surface complexes were primarily responsible for the as v adsorption mechanism moreover the successful removal of arsenic from real water matrices made the ftmo a potentially attractive adsorbent for both as v and as iii removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords fe ti mn composite oxide photooxidation oxidation adsorption arsenic 1 introduction in natural water sources arsenic normally presents as two inorganic species i e arsenate as v and arsenite as iii based on the prevailing redox conditions under an oxidizing and alkaline environment as v is the main arsenic species and exists as oxyanions h2aso4 or haso4 2 whereas under reducing conditions such as aquifers with near neutral ph trivalent nonionized arsenite as h3aso3 is the dominant arsenic species ferguson and gavis 1972 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 compared to as v as iii is more mobile toxic and difficult to be removed due to its low affinity to various adsorbents resulting from the nonionic h3aso3 mohan and pittman jr 2007 luong et al 2018 elevated levels of arsenic contaminated water derived from natural and anthropogenic sources not only causes significant problems in the provision of safe drinking water bissen and frimmel 2003 but lately has also raised concern regarding food safety heikens et al 2007 because of the high toxicity and carcinogenicity of arsenic the world health organization who has set that the maximum contaminant level mcl for arsenic in drinking water is 10 μg l who 2011 the concentration of arsenic in natural aqueous environments is substantially governed by mineral surface interactions owing to their abundance in the environment and high affinity for arsenic species metal oxides minerals particularly fe oxyhydr oxides are promising materials to control the fate and transport of arsenic in natural aquatic systems through adsorption or coprecipitation mohan and pittman jr 2007 for this reason synthetic iron hydro oxides zhao et al 2011 zhang and jia 2014 wang and giammar 2015 yang et al 2017 including ferrihydrite goethite hematite and akaganeite which are representatives of naturally occurring iron oxide materials have been extensively applied as adsorbents to remove arsenic from the aqueous phase during practical water treatment engineering these synthetic iron hydro oxides demonstrate high arsenic species immobilization efficiencies due to their strong affinity and high selectivity for inorganic arsenic species especially for as v accompanied by the advantages of low cost and extensive availability despite the high adsorption capacity iron based adsorbents exhibit low removal efficiency for as iii via simple adsorption due to its low affinity smedley and kinniburgh 2002 mohan and pittman jr 2007 lata and samadder 2016 thus oxidizing as iii into more easily extractable as v is preferred to achieve efficient arsenic immobilization zhang et al 2016 numerous oxidants or oxidant generating systems have been studied for as

park and choi 2011 guan et al 2012 gude et al 2017 despite their high efficacy in oxidizing as iii some reagents may cause several secondary problems owing to the by products formation or residuals

adsorbent to remove arsenic through the formation of inner sphere surface complexes pena et al 2006 guan et al 2012 more importantly as a typical photocatalyst tio2 can absorb photons to form an electron ecb and a hole hvb in the presence of natural light or uv light irradiation the photogenerated electron ecb conduction band and the hole hvb valence band react with surface adsorbed h2o and

v and mn ii to solution under low ph condition scott and morgan 1995 shown in reaction 10 specifically it has been proved that as iii oxidation with synthetic birnessite was followed by two steps involving the reduction of mn iv to mn iii and mn iii to mn ii given in reaction 11 and 12 moore et al 1990 nesbitt et al 1998 in addition individual manganese oxide can likewise be used for as v

drawn considerable attentions for improving arsenic removal it is provided that the complexation of metal oxides not only improves the surface properties i e wide ph range high surface area and physical chemical stability but also gets synergistic effects in heterogeneous mixed oxides thereby effectively enhancing both as iii and as v immobilization a multifunctional nanostructured fe ti mn composite oxide ftmo adsorbent was recently synthesized by a simple chemical coprecipitation method in our laboratory the prepared ftmo adsorbent exhibited high adsorption capacity toward both as v and as iii especially for the as iii species although removal characteristics of arsenic by single component fe ti or mn oxide have been intensively studied no information is available about the molecular scale adsorption mechanisms of arsenic by the ftmo adsorbent if the ftmo adsorbent is applied for arsenic removal will the mechanism be similar with that of single oxide and will the material possess the features of photocatalytic oxidation oxidation and adsorption thus a systematic study on the oxidation and adsorption of both as v and as iii by ftmo adsorbent has been conducted using zeta ftir esr and xps techniques in the present paper the main objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the oxidation state change of arsenic and material elements during arsenic removal using various spectroscopic techniques 2 to evaluate the respective role of fe ti and mn oxide in arsenic adsorption 3 to explain the possible mechanisms of both as v and as iii removal by ftmo adsorbent 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all of the reagents in this study were analytical grade and used without further purification the disodium hydrogen arsenate heptahydrate na2haso4 7h2o

chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china as v and as iii stock solution with concentration of 1000 mg l each was prepared by dissolving na2haso4 7h2o or naaso2 into deionized di water a milli q water purification system from millipore bedford ma usa respectively the working solution of required concentration of as v or as iii was freshly obtained by diluting the as v or as iii stock solution with di water besides the concentration of arsenic species was indicated as elemental as concentration 2 2 ftmo preparation the ftmo adsorbent was synthesized via an oxidation and coprecipitation approach

with naoh tio2 was prepared via hydrolyzing ticl4 with naoh and mno2 was synthesized by the reaction between kmno4 and mnso4 4h2o 2 3 batch adsorption tests bath experiments were conducted to investigate the adsorption isotherms of as v and as iii by the feooh tio2 mno2 and ftmo at room temperature 25 1 c the initial arsenic concentration varied from 2 mg l to 50 mg l with ph adjusted to 7 0 0 1 with 0 1 m hno3 and or naoh in each test 10 mg of the adsorbent sample was loaded in a 100 ml plastic vessel containing 50 ml arsenic solution with predetermined concentration ionic strength of the solution was adjusted to 0 01 m with nano3 the vessels were shaken on an orbit shaker at 170 rpm for 24 h then all samples were filtered by a 0 45 μm membrane filter and analyzed for arsenic in order to investigate the photocatalytic efficiency of the ftmo material kinetics tests were carried out respectively under darkness natural light and uv light an 8 w mercury lamp philips uv light tuv 8 w g5 254 nm poland conditions at room temperature 25 1 c the arsenite stock solution was diluted with deionized water in 1000 ml glass vessels to get 500 ml of 268 μg l arsenite solution at an ionic strength of 0 01 m nano3 the solution ph values were adjusted to 7 0 0 1 and kept constant by adding 0 1 m hno3 and or naoh and 0 1 g of ftmo adsorbent was added to the prepared arsenite solution to obtain a 200 mg l suspension the suspension was mixed with a magnetic stirrer at an agitation speed of 170 rpm about 5 ml samples were taken from the vessel at predetermined times the samples were immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter and analyzed for arsenic controlled experiments were examined at higher initial arsenic concentrations about 11 1 mg l as v and 8 6 mg l as iii under the same condition the effect of ionic strength on arsenic adsorption by ftmo adsorbent was performed by adding 10 mg of ftmo sample into a 100 ml plastic vessel containing 50 ml of arsenic solution the initial arsenic concentrations were 10 mg l as v and 15 mg l as iii respectively with the solution ionic strength varied from 0 001 m to 0 1 m by adding nano3 the ph of the solutions was adjusted every 4 h with diluted hno3 or and naoh solution to designated values in the range 4 10 during the shaking process the equilibrium ph was measured and the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter for arsenic measurement after the solutions were mixed for 24 h simulated and actual water adsorption experiments were carried out using four different water sources including simulated river water added arsenic concentration of 212 as v μg l or 198 as iii μg l songhua river heilongjiang province actual surface water actual arsenic concentration of 82 μg l as v 92 jilin province and actual underground water actual arsenic concentration of 168 μg l as iii 73 jilin province detailed water quality information can be found in table s1 100 mg of ftmo adsorbent was added into a vessel containing 2000 ml of one feed water after stirring for 6 h the mixture was separated and the residual arsenic concentration in solution was measured the concentration of as iii as v and other metal ion was determined using a high performance liquid chromatography hyphenated with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hplc icp ms nexion300x perkin elmer co usa 2 4 ftmo characterization the surface morphology of the adsorbent was obtained using a high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem jeol jem 2100 japan elemental mappings were taken on stem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx with an acquisition time of 20 min the specific surface area pore size distribution and pore volume were measured by a n2 adsorption desorption isotherm according to the bet method with a surface area analyzer asap 2000 micromeritics co usa a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer 2000 malvern uk was used to analyze the zeta potential of ftmo particles before and after arsenic adsorption the surface analyses of the ftmo adsorbent before and after arsenic adsorption were conducted using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 220i xl vg scientific uk and fourier

provided in text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the synthesized ftmo tem images and corresponding element maps of ftmo adsorbent before and after as v as iii adsorption are shown in fig 1 the ftmo adsorbent was heterogeneous aggregated and composed of nano particles which resulted in a rough surface according to the elemental mapping fe ti mn and o dispersed homogenously in the ftmo adsorbent after as v and as iii adsorption the arsenic mapping was visibly emerged suggesting that arsenic species were effectively adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent in addition the ftmo adsorbent had a higher bet surface area 434 3 m2 g and a larger pore volume 0 61 cm3 g compared to pure feooh tio2 and mno2 shown in table s2 indicating that the composite oxide had a higher potentiality for permeability and adsorption 3 2 adsorption isotherms batch isotherm studies were carried out to evaluate the arsenic adsorption capacity of the pure metal oxide and the ftmo composite oxide as could be seen from fig 2 the arsenic adsorption capacities of pure feooh and ftmo were evidently higher than that of pure tio2 and mno2 suggesting that the fe content of ftmo adsorbent played a dominant role in arsenic adsorption it was interesting that the higher adsorption capacity of as v on the feooh adsorbent was achieved than that of as iii at low arsenic equilibrium concentration about 0 1 mg l while the ftmo adsorbent could more effectively remove as iii than as v at low equilibrium concentration shown in the inset graph from fig 2 additionally the ftmo exhibited higher effectiveness in removing both as v and as iii than that of pure feooh these results might be duo to the fact that the composite ftmo effectively oxidized as iii to easily combinative as v and the possible synergistic effect in the composite oxide system enhanced both as v and as iii oxidative formed as v removal furthermore the larger specific surface area and pore volume of the ftmo adsorbent might also be one of the reasons why the arsenic adsorption capacity of the ftmo was higher than that of other pure oxide both langmuir and freundlich models freundlich 1906 langmuir 1916 text s3 were employed to simulate the adsorption isotherms data and the detailed adsorption constants obtained were summarized in table s3 the results showed that the freundlich model was more suitable to describe the experimental data than langmuir model due to its higher correlation coefficients normally the freundlich model elaborates adsorption where the adsorbent has a heterogeneous surface with adsorption sites that have different energies freundlich 1906 therefore the result suggested that the surface of ftmo adsorbent was heterogeneous and the discrepant adsorption sites with different energies might lead to a non homogeneous multilayer adsorption of as v additionally as iii removal by the ftmo might involve not only a non homogeneous multilayer adsorption process but redox reaction on the surface the maximum arsenic adsorption capacities were compared between the ftmo and previously reported composite adsorbents table s4 it was found that the ftmo outperformed many other adsorbents reported in the literature indicating that the ftmo material is a rather promising alternative for arsenic removal in actual water treatment 3 3 reaction kinetics the arsenic removal efficiency and the process of arsenic species transformation are key factors for designing adsorption contactors in practical applications therefore the kinetics of as iii removal and the concentration changes of arsenic species with time under darkness natural light and uv light were investigated as shown in fig 3 for darkness condition the total arsenic concentration rapidly reduced from 268 μg l to below 10 μg l the maximum permissible arsenic level within approximately 2 h suggesting that the ftmo adsorbent could quickly remove arsenic from the aqueous solution no as v was detected from the initial as iii solution however as v started to emerge along with the decrease of the as iii concentration during the reaction process until its concentration reached to a maximum of 9 4 μg l at 10 min this result was possibly ascribed to the higher oxidation rate of as iii to as v by mn content of the ftmo than as v adsorption at the early stage of removal process thereafter concentrations of all arsenic species slowly reduced till equilibrium for natural light and uv light conditions similar trends were observed in as iii adsorption process except that there was a faster decrease of total arsenic to below 10 μg l i e approximately 1 h and 50 min under natural light and uv light respectively and a higher peak concentration of as v reached i e 14 2 μg l and 16 9 μg l under natural light and uv light respectively in addition similar phenomena were found in as iii removal at high initial concentrations while the light illumination had no significant influence on the as v removal by the ftmo adsorbent shown in fig s1 the above results indicated that reactive oxygen species ros generated from light activated ti content of the ftmo adsorbent could enhance as iii oxidation and therefore improve its removal efficiency 3 4 effect of ionic strength and leaching of metallic ions the influence of ionic strength on the removal of as v and as iii by the ftmo adsorbent was illustrated in fig 4 no significant change or a slight increase of as v and as iii adsorption capacity was observed as the ionic strength increased from 0 001 m to 0 1 m generally adsorption of anions via outer sphere association is strongly sensitive to ionic strength where their adsorption is suppressed by competitive adsorption of weakly adsorbing anions e g cl or no3 through electrostatic forces in contrast the adsorption of anions by ligand exchange inner sphere association either shows little sensitivity to ionic strength or responds to higher ionic strength with greater adsorption mcbride 1997 which suggested that both as v and as iii oxidative formed as v anions might be chemically adsorbed by the ftmo material via forming inner sphere surface complexes at the water oxide interface in addition the leaching of metallic ions from the ftmo adsorbent at different phs was evaluated and shown in fig s2 for as v adsorption the release of metallic ions i e fe ti and mn was negligible at solution ph varying from 5 to 10 which suggested that the adsorbent possessed excellent physical and chemical stability for as iii adsorption similar leaching trends of metallic ions were found except that obvious leaching of mn ions 1 6 mg l emerged at solution ph 5 0 which was far below the theoretical value 5 6 mg l based on the reaction 10 this result might be ascribed to that the mn content of ftmo adsorbent oxidized as iii to as v coupling with the reductive release of mn ii ions from the surface of adsorbent to solution at low solution ph scott and morgan 1995 thereafter a part of mn ii ions in the solution were gradually re adsorbed by the material besides a portion of reductive formed mn ii ions might also be directly bonded on the surface of the ftmo adsorbent during the as iii removal process 3 5 real water tests to explore the ftmo sample application for practical treatment of arsenic contaminated water batch experiments in four water matrices including simulated river waters actual surface water and actual underground water were carried out and the results were presented in fig 5 obviously the ftmo adsorbent effectively removed arsenic both as v and as iii from different water matrices and all arsenic concentrations were reduced to a value less than 10 μg l the maximum permissible arsenic level after 6 h of adsorption reaction suggesting the great potential of the ftmo adsorbent on practical applications for arsenic removal 3 6 zeta potential measurements the isoelectric point iep of metal oxides is determined by protonation and deprotonation of surface hydroxyl groups the formation of inter sphere surface complexes can shift the iep due to the covalent bonding between a metal ion and an electron donating ligand e g oh or some combination of covalent and ionic bonding i e chemical reaction goldberg and johnston 2001 the zeta potentials of the ftmo adsorbent suspensions were measured before and after as v and as iii adsorption fig 6 it could be seen that the iep of the original adsorbent was about 5 9 however after as iii and as v adsorption it decreased obviously to around 4 7 and 4 2 respectively normally the specific adsorption inter sphere complexes of anions renders the surface of oxides more negatively charged which results in a shift of the iep of adsorbent to a lower ph value stumm and morgan 1996 consequently a part of nonionized as iii was possibly oxidized to anionic as v by the ftmo adsorbent and a specific adsorption chemical adsorption rather than a purely electrostatic interaction occurred at the aqueous arsenic species ftmo adsorbent interface 3 7 analysis of the ftir spectra fourier transform infrared ftir is widely used to measure the vibrations and rotations of molecular functional groups resulting from the energy exchange when radiation interacts with a sample ftir spectra of the ftmo adsorbent before and after reaction with arsenic were shown in fig 7 for the original adsorbent it was noted that the peak at 1625 cm 1 was associated with the deformation of water molecules indicating the presence of physisorbed water on the material zhang et al 2007 and two peaks at 1134 cm 1 and 1043 cm 1 were primarily ascribed to the bending vibration of hydroxyl group on metal oxides m oh li et al 2010 zhang et al 2005 after reaction with as v or as iii the m oh bending bands peaks at 1134 cm 1 and 1043 cm 1 weakened and disappeared gradually while a new band at 819 cm 1 appeared and its intensity increased with the increase of arsenic concentration it is normally reported that the sorptive bands of as iii o vibration and as v o vibration are located at 794 cm 1 and 820 cm 1 respectively goldberg and johnston 2001 pena et al 2006 zhang et al 2007 indicating that initial as iii was oxidized to as v these results also suggested that both as v and as iii were bound as a surface complex rather than a precipitated solid phase and the replacement of surface hydroxyl groups by the arsenic species was the main arsenic removal mechanism 3 8 identification of ros in the as iii ftmo light system as highly active and green oxidants reactive oxygen species ros including hydroxyl radical oh superoxide anion o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 are of great significance for environmental chemistry ros are commonly produced in the tio2 light process wang et al 2011 in order to examine and identify the ros formed in the as iii ftmo light system as we proposed above epr experiments were conducted to detect oh and o2 with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo or 1o2 with 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxyl tempo esr spectra of dmpo spin trapping adducts and tempo adducts were in situ recorded following irradiation of ftmo suspensions by dark visible light and uv light for the hydroxyl radical oh as shown in fig 8 a no characteristic signals were exhibited with ftmo or dmpo alone as well as ftmo with dmpo under dark conditions whereas four characteristic peaks representing dmpo oh with the intensities of 1 2 2 1 and special hyperfine coupling constants of αn αh 14 9 g cui et al 2017 were obviously observed in the suspension of ftmo adsorbent under visible light and uv light irradiation while no such signals were detected when as iii stock solution was added into the ftmo light system these results suggested that the tio2 content in ftmo adsorbent could be efficiently excited by visible light and uv light to create oh and the oh could successfully oxidize as iii to as v for the superoxide anion o2 the species of o2 was not detected in aqueous ftmo adsorbent dispersion under visible light or uv light illumination by dmpo spin trap esr measurements fig 8a normally o2 could not accumulate to a sufficiently large concentration to be detected in water due to their rapid dismutation reaction mccord and fridovich 1969 in order to restrain the disproportionation to give the peroxide dianion o2 2 free o2 radical in solutions is usually examined by esr dmpo spin trapping technique in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso media ben hur et al 1985 as illustrated in fig 8b six characteristic signals of dmpo o2 adducts special hyperfine coupling constants of αn 14 3 g αh 11 7 g clément et al 2005 dikalov et al 2005 were exhibited in dmso solvent of ftmo adsorbent under visible light and uv light however such signals were not detected under dark conditions or as iii ftmo light system confirming that light irradiation could activate tio2 content in ftmo adsorbent to produce o2 which as intermediates subsequently oxidized as iii for the singlet oxygen 1o2 the indirect detection of 1o2 production by means of esr spectroscopy is on the basis of the formation of stable nitroxide radical adducts lion et al 1976 the non paramagnetic spin trap tempo was chosen as a probe for 1o2 typical 3 line epr spectra of tempo 1o2 adducts special hyperfine coupling constants of αn 16 9 g li et al 2017 with equal intensities in the ftmo light system was captured in fig 8c revealing that 1o2 might be produced as the ros during the photocatalysis of the tio2 content in ftmo adsorbent moreover no such typical signals found in as iii ftmo light system also implied effective as iii oxidation by 1o2 in general the visible light activity of pure tio2 is usually weak fujishima et al 2008 wang et al 2011 the above test results indicated that some synergistic effect between fe ti and mn components in ftmo adsorbent might exist and could improve the visible light photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 content the tio2 content in ftmo adsorbent can be efficiently excited by visible light or uv light to generate electron hole pairs subsequently the pair is separated into an electron and a hole the photogenerated electron ecb in the conduction band and the valence band hole hvb can react with adsorbed oxygen h2o to produce a series of ros hoffmann et al 1995 which results in the effective oxidization of as iii to as v 3 9 surface characterization using xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps is used to identify the chemical state of elements in the uppermost few atomic layers of solid surfaces biesinger et al 2011 the surface compositions of the ftmo adsorbent before and after as v and as iii adsorption were investigated by xps and the as3d fe2p ti2p mn2p and o1s core level photoelectron spectra were presented in fig 9 as shown in fig 9a after reaction with as v or as iii the as3d core level of the adsorbent emerged clearly indicating the presence of arsenic on the surface of the ftmo material the as3d binding energies for the adsorbent after as v and as iii adsorption was 45 3 ev and 45 2 ev respectively generally reported binding energies of as3d core level for as iii and as v in arsenic oxides ranges from 44 3 to 44 5 and 45 2 45 6 ev respectively nesbitt et al 1998 chen et al 2018 on the basis of xps data fitting table s5 after both as v and as iii adsorption the adsorbed arsenic species were mainly as v which indicated that the ftmo adsorbent could effectively oxidize as iii and remove both as v and as iii the fe2p deconvoluted spectra of the samples were shown in fig 9b for the virgin ftmo adsorbent the binding energy value of fe2p3 2 710 4 ev and the splitting spin orbit value of fe2p δe 13 6 ev indicated that the oxidation state of fe phase in the adsorbent was 3 moulder et al 1992 tan et al 1990 after reaction with as v or as iii the binding energy and the peak shape of fe2p3 2 changed negligibly however a significant decrease of the fe2p spectra intensity of the spent ftmo materials was observed suggesting strong interactions between arsenic and fe phase zhang et al 2005 in other words fe species in the ftmo adsorbent might mainly perform as an arsenic adsorbent fig 9c illustrated the ti2p spectra of the adsorbent before and after arsenic adsorption the binding energy of ti2p3 2 458 1 ev and the peak shape of ti2p splitting value δe 5 7 ev indicated that the dominating chemical state of ti in the virgin adsorbent was ti iv moulder et al 1992 li et al 2010 after as v binding adsorption the ti2p spectra intensity of the ftmo adsorbent showed little change indicating that ti species had no strong interactions with as v however an obvious decrease of ti2p spectra intensity after as iii adsorption was observed this result might be ascribed as follows on the one hand the interactions between ti species and as iii species could influence and reduce the ti2p spectra intensity zhang et al 2005 on the other hand the mno2 content was reductively dissolved to solution during the as iii oxidation adsorption process scott and morgan 1995 part of reductively dissolved mn ii ions could be re adsorbed on the surface adsorption sites of the tio2 content and then oxidized to mn iii mn iv by a series of ros the reduction of original mno2 content and the re adsorption oxidation of mn ii ions might lead to some external structural changes of the material which might also decrease the ti2p spectra intensity this inference might need further clarification from the mn2p core level spectra of the virgin adsorbent displayed in fig 9d the energy spacing between the mn2p3 2 and mn2p1 2 states was 11 7 ev and the mn2p3 2 peaks appeared at 641 7 ev which might correspond with the binding energy of mn iii or mn iv in mn phase an et al 2008 cai et al 2014 in addition the spectrum for mn2p3 2 could be deconvoluted as a pair of triplets table s6 the peak at 640 7 ev was in agreement with mn2p3 2 of mno the peak at 641 6 ev could be attributed to the mn2p3 2 of mn iii in mn2o3 while the peak at 642 1 ev could be assigned to mn iv oxide nesbitt and banerjee 1998 thirupathi and smirniotis 2012 liang et al 2015 the percentages of mn iv mn iii and mn ii fitted from xps data in original ftmo adsorbent were about 62 12 and 26 respectively suggesting that the mn species in the virgin material was mainly mno2 after as v adsorption the peak shape of mn2p3 2 and the amount of each mn phase changed slightly similar to the case of ti2p this result implied that no strong interactions happened between as v and mn phase however after as iii adsorption the binding energy and the peak shape of mn2p3 2 altered obviously the content of mn iv decreased to about 17 whereas that of mn iii and mn ii increased to about 39 and 44 respectively indicating that some of the mn iv was converted to mn iii and mn ii during the as iii adsorption process this phenomenon might be ascribed to the reduction of mn iv to mn iii mn ii by bundled as iii on the surface of the ftmo adsorbent the reductive formed mn ii ions could be directly bonded on the surface of the ftmo adsorbent and could also be released to the aqueous phase especially under low ph condition part of reductively dissolved mn ii species could be adsorbed again by the ftmo sample zhang et al 2014 therewith it could further be oxidized to mnooh and or mno2 by a series of ros at the surface of the adsorbent hence it could be deduced that mn species in ftmo oxide were mainly oxidants playing an important role in the process of as iii oxidation additionally the high resolution scans of o1s spectra could be divided into three overlapped o1s peaks positioned at 529 5 ev 530 9 ev and 532 0 ev which could be assigned to oxide oxygen o2 hydroxyl group oh and adsorbed water h2o respectively li et al 2010 zhang et al 2005 as shown in fig 9e and table s7 fitting parameters as a key contributor to arsenic adsorption hydroxyl group was observed abundant on the surface of the virgin ftmo adsorbent after as v and as iii adsorption the peak area ratio of oh group decreased obviously from about 39 6 to 23 5 as v and 21 0 as iii respectively by contrast the peak area ratio of o2 increased signally from about 51 2 to 61 1 and 64 3 respectively which suggested that oh group on the ftmo adsorbent was partially substituted by arsenic species both as v and as iii during the arsenic adsorption process and subsequently inner sphere surface complexes were formed chen et al 2018 these results were consistent with the results obtained by ftir 3 10 arsenic removal mechanism as mentioned in the previous analysis the as iii removal mechanism was very complicated and the removal process might be coupled by photooxidation a oxidation b and adsorption c process specifically a for the photooxidation process the as iii molecules firstly transported from the bulk phase to the solid water interface via convection or diffusion visible light or uv light irradiation could activate the ti content in the ftmo adsorbent to produce electron hole pairs which was separated into an electron ecb and a hole hvb subsequently the ecb and hvb migrated to the surface where they were ultimately trapped wang et al 2011 the conduction band electron ecb could directly reduce the adsorbed molecular oxygen to generate the superoxide anion o2 at the surface of ftmo adsorbent while the surface hydroxyl or adsorbed water at material surface was oxidized by the valence band hole hvb to yield the hydroxyl radical oh in addition both the oxidation of o2 by hvb and the direct energy migration to molecular oxygen could produce the singlet oxygen 1o2 jańczyk et al 2006 guan et al 2012 the series of reactive oxygen species ros could effectively oxidize the adsorbed as iii to as v at the solid liquid interface b for the oxidation process of mn content in the ftmo adsorbent the as iii molecules were primarily adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent then the adsorbed as iii transferred one and or two electrons to the mn atoms by which as iii was oxidized to as v manning et al 2002 concurrently the oxidative formed as v and reductive formed mn ii ions could be separated from the surface of material into the aqueous solution especially under low ph condition and could also be directly bonded on the surface of the ftmo adsorbent part of reductively dissolved mn ii ions could be re adsorbed again by the ftmo adsorbent and then oxidized to mn iii mn iv by a series of ros at the surface of the adsorbent which improved the recycle ability and the oxidation efficiency of mn content in the ftmo material c for the adsorption approach the oxidative formed as v in the aqueous solution was transported again to the solid water interface and the formed as v was adsorbed onto the surface of the adsorbent via replacing the surface hydroxyl group or the adsorbed as iii and then forming the inner sphere surface complexes waychunas et al 1993 furthermore some synergistic effect in the composite oxide system might also enhance both the visible light photocatalytic efficiency of ti content and the overall arsenic adsorption capacity the as v adsorption mechanism was relatively simple and might be only an adsorption process in which the as v adsorption was mainly achieved through the replacement of the surface hydroxyl group and the formation of inner sphere surface complexes the arsenic removal mechanism by the ftmo adsorbent was exhibited in fig 10 4 conclusions a novel nanostructured ftmo adsorbent was synthesized for effective arsenic removal the developed material showed a significantly higher as iii uptake than as v the results of the kinetics experiment indicated that as iii specie was oxidized to as v and the light illumination could enhance the oxidation and removal efficiency of as iii the effect of ionic strength and zeta potential measurements results confirmed that both as iii and as v were removed via specific adsorption chemical adsorption rather than a purely electrostatic interaction ftir esr along with xps were used to investigate the surface change of the ftmo adsorbent before and after reaction with as iii and as v the as v adsorption mechanism was mainly achieved through the replacement of the surface hydroxyl group and the formation of inner sphere surface complexes at the water oxide interface however the as iii removal mechanism was a photooxidation oxidation coupled with adsorption approach the ti and mn content were mainly responsible for as iii oxidation and the fe content was dominant for the oxidative formed as v adsorption furthermore the material effectively removed arsenic from real water matrices suggesting the great potential of the ftmo adsorbent on the application for practical

19249,in order to attain a high efficiency and low cost adsorbent for both arsenate as v and arsenite as iii removal from as contaminated water a novel nanostructured fe ti mn composite oxide ftmo was fabricated through a one step simultaneous oxidation and co precipitation method batch control experiments and series of spectroscopy detection technologies were carried out to investigate the surface change of the ftmo adsorbent and the respective role of fe ti and mn content in the arsenic adsorption process the results showed that the ftmo adsorbent had a high adsorption capacity for both as v and as iii especially for the latter one via the formation of inner sphere complexes at the water oxide interface under both darkness and light conditions the material could effectively oxidize as iii to as v and light illumination could further apparently enhance the as iii oxidation thus achieving high adsorption efficiency of as iii combined with the characterizations from ftir esr and xps it was assumed that the predominant as iii removal mechanism could be attributed to the coupling of various processes including photooxidation oxidation and adsorption the ti and mn contents were dominant for the as iii oxidation while the fe content mainly played an important role for the adsorption of newly formed as v however the involvement of surface hydroxyl groups and the formation of inner sphere surface complexes were primarily responsible for the as v adsorption mechanism moreover the successful removal of arsenic from real water matrices made the ftmo a potentially attractive adsorbent for both as v and as iii removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords fe ti mn composite oxide photooxidation oxidation adsorption arsenic 1 introduction in natural water sources arsenic normally presents as two inorganic species i e arsenate as v and arsenite as iii based on the prevailing redox conditions under an oxidizing and alkaline environment as v is the main arsenic species and exists as oxyanions h2aso4 or haso4 2 whereas under reducing conditions such as aquifers with near neutral ph trivalent nonionized arsenite as h3aso3 is the dominant arsenic species ferguson and gavis 1972 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 compared to as v as iii is more mobile toxic and difficult to be removed due to its low affinity to various adsorbents resulting from the nonionic h3aso3 mohan and pittman jr 2007 luong et al 2018 elevated levels of arsenic contaminated water derived from natural and anthropogenic sources not only causes significant problems in the provision of safe drinking water bissen and frimmel 2003 but lately has also raised concern regarding food safety heikens et al 2007 because of the high toxicity and carcinogenicity of arsenic the world health organization who has set that the maximum contaminant level mcl for arsenic in drinking water is 10 μg l who 2011 the concentration of arsenic in natural aqueous environments is substantially governed by mineral surface interactions owing to their abundance in the environment and high affinity for arsenic species metal oxides minerals particularly fe oxyhydr oxides are promising materials to control the fate and transport of arsenic in natural aquatic systems through adsorption or coprecipitation mohan and pittman jr 2007 for this reason synthetic iron hydro oxides zhao et al 2011 zhang and jia 2014 wang and giammar 2015 yang et al 2017 including ferrihydrite goethite hematite and akaganeite which are representatives of naturally occurring iron oxide materials have been extensively applied as adsorbents to remove arsenic from the aqueous phase during practical water treatment engineering these synthetic iron hydro oxides demonstrate high arsenic species immobilization efficiencies due to their strong affinity and high selectivity for inorganic arsenic species especially for as v accompanied by the advantages of low cost and extensive availability despite the high adsorption capacity iron based adsorbents exhibit low removal efficiency for as iii via simple adsorption due to its low affinity smedley and kinniburgh 2002 mohan and pittman jr 2007 lata and samadder 2016 thus oxidizing as iii into more easily extractable as v is preferred to achieve efficient arsenic immobilization zhang et al 2016 numerous oxidants or oxidant generating systems have been studied for as

park and choi 2011 guan et al 2012 gude et al 2017 despite their high efficacy in oxidizing as iii some reagents may cause several secondary problems owing to the by products formation or residuals

affinity to arsenic and has been widely used as effective adsorption and photocatalytic media in environmental remediation dutta et al 2004 ferguson et al 2005 guan et al 2012 tio2 can function as an adsorbent to remove arsenic through the formation of inner sphere surface complexes pena et al 2006 guan et al 2012 more importantly as a typical photocatalyst tio2 can absorb photons to form an electron ecb and a hole hvb in the presence of natural light or uv light irradiation the photogenerated electron ecb conduction band and the hole hvb valence band react with surface adsorbed h2o and

v and mn ii to solution under low ph condition scott and morgan 1995 shown in reaction 10 specifically it has been proved that as iii oxidation with synthetic birnessite was followed by two steps involving the reduction of mn iv to mn iii and mn iii to mn ii given in reaction 11 and 12 moore et al 1990 nesbitt et al 1998 in addition individual manganese oxide can likewise be used for as v

drawn considerable attentions for improving arsenic removal it is provided that the complexation of metal oxides not only improves the surface properties i e wide ph range high surface area and physical chemical stability but also gets synergistic effects in heterogeneous mixed oxides thereby effectively enhancing both as iii and as v immobilization a multifunctional nanostructured fe ti mn composite oxide ftmo adsorbent was recently synthesized by a simple chemical coprecipitation method in our laboratory the prepared ftmo adsorbent exhibited high adsorption capacity toward both as v and as iii especially for the as iii species although removal characteristics of arsenic by single component fe ti or mn oxide have been intensively studied no information is available about the molecular scale adsorption mechanisms of arsenic by the ftmo adsorbent if the ftmo adsorbent is applied for arsenic removal will the mechanism be similar with that of single oxide and will the material possess the features of photocatalytic oxidation oxidation and adsorption thus a systematic study on the oxidation and adsorption of both as v and as iii by ftmo adsorbent has been conducted using zeta ftir esr and xps techniques in the present paper the main objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the oxidation state change of arsenic and material elements during arsenic removal using various spectroscopic techniques 2 to evaluate the respective role of fe ti and mn oxide in arsenic adsorption 3 to explain the possible mechanisms of both as v and as iii removal by ftmo adsorbent 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all of the reagents in this study were analytical grade and used without further purification the disodium hydrogen arsenate heptahydrate na2haso4 7h2o

strength of 0 01 m nano3 the solution ph values were adjusted to 7 0 0 1 and kept constant by adding 0 1 m hno3 and or naoh and 0 1 g of ftmo adsorbent was added to the prepared arsenite solution to obtain a 200 mg l suspension the suspension was mixed with a magnetic stirrer at an agitation speed of 170 rpm about 5 ml samples were taken from the vessel at predetermined times the samples were immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter and analyzed for arsenic controlled experiments were examined at higher initial arsenic concentrations about 11 1 mg l as v and 8 6 mg l as iii under the same condition the effect of ionic strength on arsenic adsorption by ftmo adsorbent was performed by adding 10 mg of ftmo sample into a 100 ml plastic vessel containing 50 ml of arsenic solution the initial arsenic concentrations were 10 mg l as v and 15 mg l as iii respectively with the solution ionic strength varied from 0 001 m to 0 1 m by adding nano3 the ph of the solutions was adjusted every 4 h with diluted hno3 or and naoh solution to designated values in the range 4 10 during the shaking process the equilibrium ph was measured and the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter for arsenic measurement after the solutions were mixed for 24 h simulated and actual water adsorption experiments were carried out using four different water sources including simulated river water added arsenic concentration of 212 as v μg l or 198 as iii μg l songhua river heilongjiang province actual surface water actual arsenic concentration of 82 μg l as v 92 jilin province and actual underground water actual arsenic concentration of 168 μg l as iii 73 jilin province detailed water quality information can be found in table s1 100 mg of ftmo adsorbent was added into a vessel containing 2000 ml of one feed water after stirring for 6 h the mixture was separated and the residual arsenic concentration in solution was measured the concentration of as iii as v and other metal ion was determined using a high performance liquid chromatography hyphenated with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hplc icp ms nexion300x perkin elmer co usa 2 4 ftmo characterization the surface morphology of the adsorbent was obtained using a high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem jeol jem 2100 japan elemental mappings were taken on stem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx with an acquisition time of 20 min the specific surface area pore size distribution and pore volume were measured by a n2 adsorption desorption isotherm according to the bet method with a surface area analyzer asap 2000 micromeritics co usa a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer 2000 malvern uk was used to analyze the zeta potential of ftmo particles before and after arsenic adsorption the surface analyses of the ftmo adsorbent before and after arsenic adsorption were conducted using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 220i xl vg scientific uk and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is10 thermo scientific usa epr experiments were conducted using dmpo and tempo as spin trapping agents to detect reactive oxygen species ros by determining the corresponding signals of the characteristic adducts and tested on an electron paramagnetic resonance epr instrument bruker germany the operation details of these measurement techniques were provided in text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the synthesized ftmo tem images and corresponding element maps of ftmo adsorbent before and after as v as iii adsorption are shown in fig 1 the ftmo adsorbent was heterogeneous aggregated and composed of nano particles which resulted in a rough surface according to the elemental mapping fe ti mn and o dispersed homogenously in the ftmo adsorbent after as v and as iii adsorption the arsenic mapping was visibly emerged suggesting that arsenic species were effectively adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent in addition the ftmo adsorbent had a higher bet surface area 434 3 m2 g and a larger pore volume 0 61 cm3 g compared to pure feooh tio2 and mno2 shown in table s2 indicating that the composite oxide had a higher potentiality for permeability and adsorption 3 2 adsorption isotherms batch isotherm studies were carried out to evaluate the arsenic adsorption capacity of the pure metal oxide and the ftmo composite oxide as could be seen from fig 2 the arsenic adsorption capacities of pure feooh and ftmo were evidently higher than that of pure tio2 and mno2 suggesting that the fe content of ftmo adsorbent played a dominant role in arsenic adsorption it was interesting that the higher adsorption capacity of as v on the feooh adsorbent was achieved than that of as iii at low arsenic equilibrium concentration about 0 1 mg l while the ftmo adsorbent could more effectively remove as iii than as v at low equilibrium concentration shown in the inset graph from fig 2 additionally the ftmo exhibited higher effectiveness in removing both as v and as iii than that of pure feooh these results might be duo to the fact that the composite ftmo effectively oxidized as iii to easily combinative as v and the possible synergistic effect in the composite oxide system enhanced both as v and as iii oxidative formed as v removal furthermore the larger specific surface area and pore volume of the ftmo adsorbent might also be one of the reasons why the arsenic adsorption capacity of the ftmo was higher than that of other pure oxide both langmuir and freundlich models freundlich 1906 langmuir 1916 text s3 were employed to simulate the adsorption isotherms data and the detailed adsorption constants obtained were summarized in table s3 the results showed that the freundlich model was more suitable to describe the experimental data than langmuir model due to its higher correlation coefficients normally the freundlich model elaborates adsorption where the adsorbent has a heterogeneous surface with adsorption sites that have different energies freundlich 1906 therefore the result suggested that the surface of ftmo adsorbent was heterogeneous and the discrepant adsorption sites with different energies might lead to a non homogeneous multilayer adsorption of as v additionally as iii removal by the ftmo might involve not only a non homogeneous multilayer adsorption process but redox reaction on the surface the maximum arsenic adsorption capacities were compared between the ftmo and previously reported composite adsorbents table s4 it was found that the ftmo outperformed many other adsorbents reported in the literature indicating that the ftmo material is a rather promising alternative for arsenic removal in actual water treatment 3 3 reaction kinetics the arsenic removal efficiency and the process of arsenic species transformation are key factors for designing adsorption contactors in practical applications therefore the kinetics of as iii removal and the concentration changes of arsenic species with time under darkness natural light and uv light were investigated as shown in fig 3 for darkness condition the total arsenic concentration rapidly reduced from 268 μg l to below 10 μg l the maximum permissible arsenic level within approximately 2 h suggesting that the ftmo adsorbent could quickly remove arsenic from the aqueous solution no as v was detected from the initial as iii solution however as v started to emerge along with the decrease of the as iii concentration during the reaction process until its concentration reached to a maximum of 9 4 μg l at 10 min this result was possibly ascribed to the higher oxidation rate of as iii to as v by mn content of the ftmo than as v adsorption at the early stage of removal process thereafter concentrations of all arsenic species slowly reduced till equilibrium for natural light and uv light conditions similar trends were observed in as iii adsorption process except that there was a faster decrease of total arsenic to below 10 μg l i e approximately 1 h and 50 min under natural light and uv light respectively and a higher peak concentration of as v reached i e 14 2 μg l and 16 9 μg l under natural light and uv light respectively in addition similar phenomena were found in as iii removal at high initial concentrations while the light illumination had no significant influence on the as v removal by the ftmo adsorbent shown in fig s1 the above results indicated that reactive oxygen species ros generated from light activated ti content of the ftmo adsorbent could enhance as iii oxidation and therefore improve its removal efficiency 3 4 effect of ionic strength and leaching of metallic ions the influence of ionic strength on the removal of as v and as iii by the ftmo adsorbent was illustrated in fig 4 no significant change or a slight increase of as v and as iii adsorption capacity was observed as the ionic strength increased from 0 001 m to 0 1 m generally adsorption of anions via outer sphere association is strongly sensitive to ionic strength where their adsorption is suppressed by competitive adsorption of weakly adsorbing anions e g cl or no3 through electrostatic forces in contrast the adsorption of anions by ligand exchange inner sphere association either shows little sensitivity to ionic strength or responds to higher ionic strength with greater adsorption mcbride 1997 which suggested that both as v and as iii oxidative formed as v anions might be chemically adsorbed by the ftmo material via forming inner sphere surface complexes at the water oxide interface in addition the leaching of metallic ions from the ftmo adsorbent at different phs was evaluated and shown in fig s2 for as v adsorption the release of metallic ions i e fe ti and mn was negligible at solution ph varying from 5 to 10 which suggested that the adsorbent possessed excellent physical and chemical stability for as iii adsorption similar leaching trends of metallic ions were found except that obvious leaching of mn ions 1 6 mg l emerged at solution ph 5 0 which was far below the theoretical value 5 6 mg l based on the reaction 10 this result might be ascribed to that the mn content of ftmo adsorbent oxidized as iii to as v coupling with the reductive release of mn ii ions from the surface of adsorbent to solution at low solution ph scott and morgan 1995 thereafter a part of mn ii ions in the solution were gradually re adsorbed by the material besides a portion of reductive formed mn ii ions might also be directly bonded on the surface of the ftmo adsorbent during the as iii removal process 3 5 real water tests to explore the ftmo sample application for practical treatment of arsenic contaminated water batch experiments in four water matrices including simulated river waters actual surface water and actual underground water were carried out and the results were presented in fig 5 obviously the ftmo adsorbent effectively removed arsenic both as v and as iii from different water matrices and all arsenic concentrations were reduced to a value less than 10 μg l the maximum permissible arsenic level after 6 h of adsorption reaction suggesting the great potential of the ftmo adsorbent on practical applications for arsenic removal 3 6 zeta potential measurements the isoelectric point iep of metal oxides is determined by protonation and deprotonation of surface hydroxyl groups the formation of inter sphere surface complexes can shift the iep due to the covalent bonding between a metal ion and an electron donating ligand e g oh or some combination of covalent and ionic bonding i e chemical reaction goldberg and johnston 2001 the zeta potentials of the ftmo adsorbent suspensions were measured before and after as v and as iii adsorption fig 6 it could be seen that the iep of the original adsorbent was about 5 9 however after as iii and as v adsorption it decreased obviously to around 4 7 and 4 2 respectively normally the specific adsorption inter sphere complexes of anions renders the surface of oxides more negatively charged which results in a shift of the iep of adsorbent to a lower ph value stumm and morgan 1996 consequently a part of nonionized as iii was possibly oxidized to anionic as v by the ftmo adsorbent and a specific adsorption chemical adsorption rather than a purely electrostatic interaction occurred at the aqueous arsenic species ftmo adsorbent interface 3 7 analysis of the ftir spectra fourier transform infrared ftir is widely used to measure the vibrations and rotations of molecular functional groups resulting from the energy exchange when radiation interacts with a sample ftir spectra of the ftmo adsorbent before and after reaction with arsenic were shown in fig 7 for the original adsorbent it was noted that the peak at 1625 cm 1 was associated with the deformation of water molecules indicating the presence of physisorbed water on the material zhang et al 2007 and two peaks at 1134 cm 1 and 1043 cm 1 were primarily ascribed to the bending vibration of hydroxyl group on metal oxides m oh li et al 2010 zhang et al 2005 after reaction with as v or as iii the m oh bending bands peaks at 1134 cm 1 and 1043 cm 1 weakened and disappeared gradually while a new band at 819 cm 1 appeared and its intensity increased with the increase of arsenic concentration it is normally reported that the sorptive bands of as iii o vibration and as v o vibration are located at 794 cm 1 and 820 cm 1 respectively goldberg and johnston 2001 pena et al 2006 zhang et al 2007 indicating that initial as iii was oxidized to as v these results also suggested that both as v and as iii were bound as a surface complex rather than a precipitated solid phase and the replacement of surface hydroxyl groups by the arsenic species was the main arsenic removal mechanism 3 8 identification of ros in the as iii ftmo light system as highly active and green oxidants reactive oxygen species ros including hydroxyl radical oh superoxide anion o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 are of great significance for environmental chemistry ros are commonly produced in the tio2 light process wang et al 2011 in order to examine and identify the ros formed in the as iii ftmo light system as we proposed above epr experiments were conducted to detect oh and o2 with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo or 1o2 with 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxyl tempo esr spectra of dmpo spin trapping adducts and tempo adducts were in situ recorded following irradiation of ftmo suspensions by dark visible light and uv light for the hydroxyl radical oh as shown in fig 8 a no characteristic signals were exhibited with ftmo or dmpo alone as well as ftmo with dmpo under dark conditions whereas four characteristic peaks representing dmpo oh with the intensities of 1 2 2 1 and special hyperfine coupling constants of αn αh 14 9 g cui et al 2017 were obviously observed in the suspension of ftmo adsorbent under visible light and uv light irradiation while no such signals were detected when as iii stock solution was added into the ftmo light system these results suggested that the tio2 content in ftmo adsorbent could be efficiently excited by visible light and uv light to create oh and the oh could successfully oxidize as iii to as v for the superoxide anion o2 the species of o2 was not detected in aqueous ftmo adsorbent dispersion under visible light or uv light illumination by dmpo spin trap esr measurements fig 8a normally o2 could not accumulate to a sufficiently large concentration to be detected in water due to their rapid dismutation reaction mccord and fridovich 1969 in order to restrain the disproportionation to give the peroxide dianion o2 2 free o2 radical in solutions is usually examined by esr dmpo spin trapping technique in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso media ben hur et al 1985 as illustrated in fig 8b six characteristic signals of dmpo o2 adducts special hyperfine coupling constants of αn 14 3 g αh 11 7 g clément et al 2005 dikalov et al 2005 were exhibited in dmso solvent of ftmo adsorbent under visible light and uv light however such signals were not detected under dark conditions or as iii ftmo light system confirming that light irradiation could activate tio2 content in ftmo adsorbent to produce o2 which as intermediates subsequently oxidized as iii for the singlet oxygen 1o2 the indirect detection of 1o2 production by means of esr spectroscopy is on the basis of the formation of stable nitroxide radical adducts lion et al 1976 the non paramagnetic spin trap tempo was chosen as a probe for 1o2 typical 3 line epr spectra of tempo 1o2 adducts special hyperfine coupling constants of αn 16 9 g li et al 2017 with equal intensities in the ftmo light system was captured in fig 8c revealing that 1o2 might be produced as the ros during the photocatalysis of the tio2 content in ftmo adsorbent moreover no such typical signals found in as iii ftmo light system also implied effective as iii oxidation by 1o2 in general the visible light activity of pure tio2 is usually weak fujishima et al 2008 wang et al 2011 the above test results indicated that some synergistic effect between fe ti and mn components in ftmo adsorbent might exist and could improve the visible light photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 content the tio2 content in ftmo adsorbent can be efficiently excited by visible light or uv light to generate electron hole pairs subsequently the pair is separated into an electron and a hole the photogenerated electron ecb in the conduction band and the valence band hole hvb can react with adsorbed oxygen h2o to produce a series of ros hoffmann et al 1995 which results in the effective oxidization of as iii to as v 3 9 surface characterization using xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps is used to identify the chemical state of elements in the uppermost few atomic layers of solid surfaces biesinger et al 2011 the surface compositions of the ftmo adsorbent before and after as v and as iii adsorption were investigated by xps and the as3d fe2p ti2p mn2p and o1s core level photoelectron spectra were presented in fig 9 as shown in fig 9a after reaction with as v or as iii the as3d core level of the adsorbent emerged clearly indicating the presence of arsenic on the surface of the ftmo material the as3d binding energies for the adsorbent after as v and as iii adsorption was 45 3 ev and 45 2 ev respectively generally reported binding energies of as3d core level for as iii and as v in arsenic oxides ranges from 44 3 to 44 5 and 45 2 45 6 ev respectively nesbitt et al 1998 chen et al 2018 on the basis of xps data fitting table s5 after both as v and as iii adsorption the adsorbed arsenic species were mainly as v which indicated that the ftmo adsorbent could effectively oxidize as iii and remove both as v and as iii the fe2p deconvoluted spectra of the samples were shown in fig 9b for the virgin ftmo adsorbent the binding energy value of fe2p3 2 710 4 ev and the splitting spin orbit value of fe2p δe 13 6 ev indicated that the oxidation state of fe phase in the adsorbent was 3 moulder et al 1992 tan et al 1990 after reaction with as v or as iii the binding energy and the peak shape of fe2p3 2 changed negligibly however a significant decrease of the fe2p spectra intensity of the spent ftmo materials was observed suggesting strong interactions between arsenic and fe phase zhang et al 2005 in other words fe species in the ftmo adsorbent might mainly perform as an arsenic adsorbent fig 9c illustrated the ti2p spectra of the adsorbent before and after arsenic adsorption the binding energy of ti2p3 2 458 1 ev and the peak shape of ti2p splitting value δe 5 7 ev indicated that the dominating chemical state of ti in the virgin adsorbent was ti iv moulder et al 1992 li et al 2010 after as v binding adsorption the ti2p spectra intensity of the ftmo adsorbent showed little change indicating that ti species had no strong interactions with as v however an obvious decrease of ti2p spectra intensity after as iii adsorption was observed this result might be ascribed as follows on the one hand the interactions between ti species and as iii species could influence and reduce the ti2p spectra intensity zhang et al 2005 on the other hand the mno2 content was reductively dissolved to solution during the as iii oxidation adsorption process scott and morgan 1995 part of reductively dissolved mn ii ions could be re adsorbed on the surface adsorption sites of the tio2 content and then oxidized to mn iii mn iv by a series of ros the reduction of original mno2 content and the re adsorption oxidation of mn ii ions might lead to some external structural changes of the material which might also decrease the ti2p spectra intensity this inference might need further clarification from the mn2p core level spectra of the virgin adsorbent displayed in fig 9d the energy spacing between the mn2p3 2 and mn2p1 2 states was 11 7 ev and the mn2p3 2 peaks appeared at 641 7 ev which might correspond with the binding energy of mn iii or mn iv in mn phase an et al 2008 cai et al 2014 in addition the spectrum for mn2p3 2 could be deconvoluted as a pair of triplets table s6 the peak at 640 7 ev was in agreement with mn2p3 2 of mno the peak at 641 6 ev could be attributed to the mn2p3 2 of mn iii in mn2o3 while the peak at 642 1 ev could be assigned to mn iv oxide nesbitt and banerjee 1998 thirupathi and smirniotis 2012 liang et al 2015 the percentages of mn iv mn iii and mn ii fitted from xps data in original ftmo adsorbent were about 62 12 and 26 respectively suggesting that the mn species in the virgin material was mainly mno2 after as v adsorption the peak shape of mn2p3 2 and the amount of each mn phase changed slightly similar to the case of ti2p this result implied that no strong interactions happened between as v and mn phase however after as iii adsorption the binding energy and the peak shape of mn2p3 2 altered obviously the content of mn iv decreased to about 17 whereas that of mn iii and mn ii increased to about 39 and 44 respectively indicating that some of the mn iv was converted to mn iii and mn ii during the as iii adsorption process this phenomenon might be ascribed to the reduction of mn iv to mn iii mn ii by bundled as iii on the surface of the ftmo adsorbent the reductive formed mn ii ions could be directly bonded on the surface of the ftmo adsorbent and could also be released to the aqueous phase especially under low ph condition part of reductively dissolved mn ii species could be adsorbed again by the ftmo sample zhang et al 2014 therewith it could further be oxidized to mnooh and or mno2 by a series of ros at the surface of the adsorbent hence it could be deduced that mn species in ftmo oxide were mainly oxidants playing an important role in the process of as iii oxidation additionally the high resolution scans of o1s spectra could be divided into three overlapped o1s peaks positioned at 529 5 ev 530 9 ev and 532 0 ev which could be assigned to oxide oxygen o2 hydroxyl group oh and adsorbed water h2o respectively li et al 2010 zhang et al 2005 as shown in fig 9e and table s7 fitting parameters as a key contributor to arsenic adsorption hydroxyl group was observed abundant on the surface of the virgin ftmo adsorbent after as v and as iii adsorption the peak area ratio of oh group decreased obviously from about 39 6 to 23 5 as v and 21 0 as iii respectively by contrast the peak area ratio of o2 increased signally from about 51 2 to 61 1 and 64 3 respectively which suggested that oh group on the ftmo adsorbent was partially substituted by arsenic species both as v and as iii during the arsenic adsorption process and subsequently inner sphere surface complexes were formed chen et al 2018 these results were consistent with the results obtained by ftir 3 10 arsenic removal mechanism as mentioned in the previous analysis the as iii removal mechanism was very complicated and the removal process might be coupled by photooxidation a oxidation b and adsorption c process specifically a for the photooxidation process the as iii molecules firstly transported from the bulk phase to the solid water interface via convection or diffusion visible light or uv light irradiation could activate the ti content in the ftmo adsorbent to produce electron hole pairs which was separated into an electron ecb and a hole hvb subsequently the ecb and hvb migrated to the surface where they were ultimately trapped wang et al 2011 the conduction band electron ecb could directly reduce the adsorbed molecular oxygen to generate the superoxide anion o2 at the surface of ftmo adsorbent while the surface hydroxyl or adsorbed water at material surface was oxidized by the valence band hole hvb to yield the hydroxyl radical oh in addition both the oxidation of o2 by hvb and the direct energy migration to molecular oxygen could produce the singlet oxygen 1o2 jańczyk et al 2006 guan et al 2012 the series of reactive oxygen species ros could effectively oxidize the adsorbed as iii to as v at the solid liquid interface b for the oxidation process of mn content in the ftmo adsorbent the as iii molecules were primarily adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent then the adsorbed as iii transferred one and or two electrons to the mn atoms by which as iii was oxidized to as v manning et al 2002 concurrently the oxidative formed as v and reductive formed mn ii ions could be separated from the surface of material into the aqueous solution especially under low ph condition and could also be directly bonded on the surface of the ftmo adsorbent part of reductively dissolved mn ii ions could be re adsorbed again by the ftmo adsorbent and then oxidized to mn iii mn iv by a series of ros at the surface of the adsorbent which improved the recycle ability and the oxidation efficiency of mn content in the ftmo material c for the adsorption approach the oxidative formed as v in the aqueous solution was transported again to the solid water interface and the formed as v was adsorbed onto the surface of the adsorbent via replacing the surface hydroxyl group or the adsorbed as iii and then forming the inner sphere surface complexes waychunas et al 1993 furthermore some synergistic effect in the composite oxide system might also enhance both the visible light photocatalytic efficiency of ti content and the overall arsenic adsorption capacity the as v adsorption mechanism was relatively simple and might be only an adsorption process in which the as v adsorption was mainly achieved through the replacement of the surface hydroxyl group and the formation of inner sphere surface complexes the arsenic removal mechanism by the ftmo adsorbent was exhibited in fig 10 4 conclusions a novel nanostructured ftmo adsorbent was synthesized for effective arsenic removal the developed material showed a significantly higher as iii uptake than as v the results of the kinetics experiment indicated that as iii specie was oxidized to as v and the light illumination could enhance the oxidation and removal efficiency of as iii the effect of ionic strength and zeta potential measurements results confirmed that both as iii and as v were removed via specific adsorption chemical adsorption rather than a purely electrostatic interaction ftir esr along with xps were used to investigate the surface change of the ftmo adsorbent before and after reaction with as iii and as v the as v adsorption mechanism was mainly achieved through the replacement of the surface hydroxyl group and the formation of inner sphere surface complexes at the water oxide interface however the as iii removal mechanism was a photooxidation oxidation coupled with adsorption approach the ti and mn content were mainly responsible for as iii oxidation and the fe content was dominant for the oxidative formed as v adsorption furthermore the material effectively removed arsenic from real water matrices suggesting the great potential of the ftmo adsorbent on the application for practical
