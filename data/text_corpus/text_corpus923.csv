4615,a reliable fog forecast can assist in water resource management and mitigate against hazardous effects on transport networks however diagnosing fog from numerical weather prediction models remains a challenge and various methods have been developed to achieve this one approach is to use a multi rule based method where threshold values of multiple variables are employed to define fog conditions in the forecast such a method is presented here for next day forecasts of radiation fog at abu dhabi in the united arab emirates variables tested include the dew point depression wind speed modified richardson index inversion depth relative humidity and liquid water content of these the best performing rule included relative humidity 94 wind speed 3ms 1 and inversion depth 250 m with a probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far of 0 62 0 37 the worst performing rule was liquid water content with a pod far of 0 37 0 31 model performance was more sensitive to inversion depth than wind speed and rules that included inversion depth performed better than rules that included the modified richardson number a qualitative spatial analysis showed that rules produced realistic fog patches when compared to satellite images this suggests that the geophysical parameters chosen to define rules are well suited for defining fog as long as the model bias is sufficiently small to fall within the threshold values this method worked well for the study region and did not demonstrate any seasonal bias keywords radiation fog operational forecast rule based method lwc visibility tdep wrf arid region 1 introduction a reliable fog forecast can assist in water resource management and mitigate against hazardous effects on transport networks gultepe et al 2009 gultepe et al 2007 westcott and kristovich 2009 de villiers and van heerden 2007 stolaki et al 2009 however diagnosing fog from numerical weather prediction models remains a challenge bergot et al 2015 bergot et al 2007 yang et al 2010 and various methods have been developed to achieve this one approach is to use a multi rule based method where threshold values of multiple variables are employed to define fog conditions in the forecast e g zhou and du 2010 such a method is presented here for next day forecasts of radiation fog at abu dhabi in the united arab emirates fog is defined as conditions where visibility is less than 1000 m due to the presence of water droplets world meteorological organization 2008 it is the most extreme condition of low visibility from condensation followed by mist 1 km vis 5 km and haze vis 5 km haze is due to high water vapour mixing ratio but relative humidity is below 90 historically fog is difficult to diagnose from mesoscale model variables bergot et al 2015 bergot et al 2007 yang et al 2010 one option for defining fog in the model is to use the cloud water mixing ratio sometimes referred to as liquid water content lwc in the lowest model level if positive or in excess of a given threshold fog is deemed to be present at the site a variant of this method is to integrate the cloud water mixing ratio over a set of model levels instead of just taking the value at the lowest level an approached followed e g by yang et al 2010 however mesoscale models are often too coarse in resolution to solve this condensation process explicitly or display deficiencies in the physical parameterization at these scales e g bergot et al 2017 furthermore the challenge to separate fog from mist and haze still remains the final desired model diagnostic of a fog forecast is visibility many visibility equations have been published based on observations using lwc as the main dependent variable with variations that include water vapour mixing ratio wind speed or relative humidity rh clark et al 2008 gultepe and milbrandt 2007 stoelinga et al 1999 bang et al 2009 smirnova et al 2000 gultepe et al 2006 a visibility forecast provides actionable information to end users the physics of visibility is based on mie theory and the associated extinction efficiency related to particle size however in situ information on particle size is scarce and has been shown to vary from case to case at a single location e g zhang et al 2014 the main drawback of this approach is again the dependence on model performance of lwc droplet number and droplet size distribution this has led to the development of visibility equations based on relative humidity in place of droplet information e g bang et al 2009 bieringer et al 2006 smirnova et al 2000 alternatively a multi variable rule based method can be used where model variables within a certain range or below a predefined threshold indicate fog conditions as was first proposed by croft et al 1997 this approach has been shown to improve forecast skill compared to lwc methods zhou and du 2010 zhou and du 2010 defined a set of variables to represent fog conditions for the different types of fog described by tardif and rasmussen 2007 for fog to be present either of the following conditions need to be met i lwc 0 015 g kg 1 or ii cloud top 400 m and cloud base 50 m or iii 10 m wind speed 2 m s 1 and 2 m rh 90 these three categories accounted for types of fog like advection stratus lowering or ground fog the hit rate or probability of detection pod the fraction of the fog events that are successfully predicted by the model optimal score of 1 using these criteria ranged from 0 1 to 0 6 which was overall higher than using a lwc 0 criteria for fog the false alarm ratio the fraction of the model forecasts that turned out not to be correct optimal score of 0 ranged from about 0 4 to 0 65 for these criteria which was about the same as the lwc 0 method baker et al 2002 used a different set of criteria to diagnose radiation fog which accounted for vertical mixing of moisture and atmospheric stability firstly like zhou and du s third condition they assume that the surface relative humidity is above 95 and that wind speed is calm and below 3 ms 1 in addition they define two new parameters the cross over temperature which is the 2 m dew point temperature during the warmest hours of the day and a modified richardson index which indicates vertical stability due to temperature and wind speed the thresholds proposed for these two new parameters are tcrossover 1 66 c and 0 04 respectively although they do not report on model performance we will discuss more on the use of the modified richardson parameter in the methodology section as it proves useful for radiation fog cases payra and mohan 2014 used i near surface relative humidity gradient rh2 meters rhsurface 4 5 ii 10 meter wind speed 1 4 2 8 ms 1 iii near surface temperature gradient tsurface t2 meters 0 c and iv dew point depression less than 8 c criteria to define fog over northern india and reported high pod results in excess of 90 however they do not state the false alarm ratio which we assume to be high as well menut et al 2014 added a new rule to diagnose fog which is the rate of cooling in the hours preceding radiation fog events in paris their main aim was to model pre fog conditions and they found that the cooling rate of 2 m temperature should be 0 5 c over a 3 h period in addition and due to the availability of measurements at their sites of interest they required the net infrared flux to be 10 wm 2 which means that surface cooling should be occurring the rh 2 m 90 and 10 m wind speed 3 ms 1 their best model pod far scores were 0 58 0 37 to 0 74 0 37 which corresponds to the best performance so far for a multi rule based approach interestingly they also applied these thresholds to the observed data at their site and reported a pod far of 0 87 0 39 in other words if the model simulated the observations exactly this is the theoretical best performance that can be achieved with the employed criteria and thresholds román cascón et al 2016 later applied the same criteria to two sites in europe one in the netherlands and one in spain when using the same threshold values their model forecast pod far scores were 0 20 0 10 and 0 34 0 17 for the netherlands and spain respectively which is a rather poor forecast performance however when applied to the observed data the pod far scores were 0 86 0 21 and 0 64 0 14 respectively which is a very good result due to the poor model performance they adjusted the threshold values based on observations collected at the sites and later improved the model pod far scores to 0 86 0 37 and 0 59 0 35 for netherlands and spain respectively the observed pod far scores also improved to 82 1 30 6 and 73 9 22 3 respectively while criteria variables remained the same in this instance the optimum threshold can change from site to site which can only be determined if site specific observations are available in this paper a rule based application of diagnosing fog from an operational version of the weather research and forecasting wrf model is presented the rules are based on commonly available variables from automatic weather stations and soundings so that the method is transferable to other locations with similar measurements the performance of the next day s forecast is assessed against station data from abu dhabi s international airport and the results are discussed with reference to previous studies that are summarized above finally a qualitative spatial comparison of the model fog mask and the satellite rgb image is presented the work is structured as follows in section 2 a description of the observational datasets the rule based method and the setup of the wrf model is presented in section 3 the thresholds employed for each criterion are determined in section 4 the performance of the wrf model is evaluated a summary of the main findings is given in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 study area the united arab emirates uae is an arid country located on the northeastern edge of the arabian peninsula fig 1 with a mean annual rainfall of about 78 mm year ouarda and charron 2014 wehbe et al 2017 wehbe et al 2018 it covers an area of 83 600 km2 which is mostly sparse to bare vegetation and the main soil type is sand and loamy sand it relies heavily on groundwater and desalination as sources of fresh water and treated sewage effluent for irrigation aldababseh et al 2018 despite being an arid region the mean water vapour mixing ratio can reach 11 18 g kg in winter summer and the region experiences frequent fog in winter which can extend over most of the country aldababseh and temimi 2017 bartok et al 2012 de villiers and van heerden 2007 weston et al 2021 abu dhabi s international airport experiences radiation fog de villiers and van heerden 2007 between 8 and 51 days per year weston et al 2021 the sea breeze transports moisture from the arabian gulf to the interior and can penetrate 130 km inland eager et al 2008 while fog can extend up to about 200 km inland at the southern border with saudi arabia e g weston and temimi 2020 fog in the uae forms under calm conditions on winter nights the clear night sky combined with the high albedo desert surface means that the air temperature drops quickly at night this leads to the formation of nocturnal inversion layers which trap advected moisture near the surface eg temimi et al 2020 moisture is transported in during the day with the sea breeze at night the return land breeze is weaker and often calm fog is most frequent at the coldest time of the night just before sunrise and dissipates shortly after sunrise de villiers and van heerden 2007 weston et al 2021 the emirates have an expanding agricultural sector and have utilized groundwater waste water and desalinated water aldababseh et al 2018 fog harvesting sites in neighboring saudi arabia captured between 2 500 and 3 200 l of water in less than three months during the fog season gandhidasan and abualhamayel 2012 however fog harvesting has yet to be considered as a source of fresh water to supplement agricultural irrigation in the uae the study site is abu dhabi s international airport auh which is located on the mainland coast line in abu dhabi city the airport is at the edge of the city and is mostly surrounded by bare ground rather than urban area the airport has meteorological aerodrome reports metar hourly observations that include standard atmospheric state measurements along with visibility and weather codes 2 2 study period the study period covered 10 winter months 303 days over two seasons the first season is from december 2016 to march 2017 and the second season is october 2017 to march 2018 during this period 35 fog days were recorded at auh 2 3 data sets 2 3 1 metar data metar observations from auh were used to identify fog conditions and for model verification data was downloaded from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national climatic data center ncdc database ncei 2001 these reports include visibility measurements and a weather code indicating the presence of fog table 1 fog was defined as conditions where visibility was less than or equal to 1000 m and one of the fog codes were present both parameters are required to define fog as low visibility can also occur due to dust events or rainfall events relative humidity cannot be used to define fog events as it is high during rainfall events 2 3 2 radiosonde radiosonde data was used to characterize vertical profiles of temperature during fog and clear sky conditions this was conducted to see if there is a difference in surface layer inversion characteristics under fog conditions that may be helpful in defining fog rules furthermore the vertical temperature profiles forms part of the modified richardson index described in section 3 3 which is a parameter used to define some rules seventeen years of data from 2000 to 2017 were obtained from the university of wyoming s website oolman 2019 the 00 utc sounding was analysed as it corresponds to 04 h00 local standard time lst roughly when fog forms at the site e g chaouch et al 2016 weston et al 2019 profiles for fog conditions were identified by matching the date of fog days from the metar data described above clear sky conditions were defined as days that lacked cloud cover codes in the metar defined as ovc overcast or 8 8 bkn broken or 7 8 sct scattered or 4 8 and few few or 2 8 and lacked the fog code 2 3 3 seviri the fog product night microphysical from the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri instrument on board meteosat 10 situated over 9 5 e was utilized for this study schmetz et al 2002 the resolution is about 4 km and images are available every 15 min in this fog product the red channel is the difference between 12 0 and 10 8 µm channels linear stretch 4 to 2 k the green channel is the difference between 10 8 and 3 9 µm channels linear stretch 0 to 10 k and the blue channel is the 10 8 µm channel linear stretch 243 to 293 k this is used for a qualitative assessment of the spatial extent of the model predicted fog extent 2 4 defining rules in the rule based approach threshold values are defined for selected variables namely the 2 meter dew point depression 10 meter horizontal wind speed atmospheric stability and visibility a combination of these thresholds defines a rule in order to determine suitable threshold values at the site the metar data was analyzed for fog and non fog conditions the metar data was analyzed for the years 2000 2016 and for the months of october to march excluding december 2016 which is included in the model results these months are when fog activity is highest and the sample period excludes the modelling period frequency distributions of surface variables dew point depression and wind speed are calculated and act as a guide for selecting a suitable threshold the results of this analysis are presented in section3 radiation fog occurs under stable conditions to represent the vertical stratification of the atmosphere baker et al 2002 introduced a modified richardson index mri which accounts for the vertical temperature gradient and wind shear and is defined as 1 mri t b t sfc u 1 943 2 where tb boundary layer temperature c where boundary layer is at either 900 hpa or psfc 35 hpa pressure level tsfc surface temperature c and u surface wind speed in ms 1 values of mri above 0 04 are considered stable 0 025 0 04 are indicative of marginally stable conditions and 0 025 corresponds to a mixed layer the mri was calculated at auh using a combination of the metar and radiosonde data the suitability of the 0 04 value was assessed for fog cases at the auh site the results of the analysis are presented in section 3 radiosonde data was analyzed from january 2000 to march 2017 a linear relationship between relative humidity and visibility was defined from the metar observations visibility in kilometers was calculated using a linear equation where relative humidity is the independent variable eq 2 visibility was assumed to be 0 m when relative humidity was 100 2 vis m r h c when rh 85 where m is the slope and c is the y intercept a visibility equation normally includes an exponential function over a large range in visibility 0 10 km bang et al 2009 clark et al 2008 gultepe et al 2006 smirnova et al 2000 smith et al 2002 stoelinga et al 1999 however fog cases occur on a short segment of the exponential curve and near the y limit i e low visibility which can be treated as a linear segment a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the observed rh data by perturbing m and c and assessed against observed fog events a contingency table was constructed for a time window of 00 to 12 local time if fog was reported in this window and the visibility was 1000 m it is considered a hit the probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far were calculated from the contingency table the equation with the best score was applied to model output as the visibility rule for defining fog it is assumed that rules are relevant over land only as they are based on observations reported at a land based station marine fog is not considered at any level in the design or evaluation of the rules 2 5 wrf model a two nest configuration of 12 and 4 km fig 1 with one way feedback is run with wrf v4 1 2 skamarock et al 2019 only results from the 4 km domain are analyzed and presented in this paper simulations are initialized at 06 utc with the 0 25 gfs version 14 ncep 2015 and run for 48 h the first 30 h from the forecast are selected for verification excluding the first 6 h which allow for model spin up chaouch et al 2016 weston et al 2019 land cover classes are taken from the united states geological survey usgs global database loveland et al 2000 sertel et al 2010 model physics parameterization included the rapid radiative transfer model for general circulation model applications rrtmg for short wave radiation and rrtm for longwave radiation iacono et al 2008 mlawer et al 1997 the quasi normal scale elimination qnse planetary boundary layer pbl scheme is implemented with its associated surface layer physics scheme sukoriansky et al 2005 chaouch et al 2016 tested seven pbl parameterization schemes for five fog events in auh and found that the qnse scheme gave the best results for fog events in the region capturing the vertical temperature and moisture profiles at abu dhabi the regular thompson cloud microphysics scheme is employed thompson et al 2008 following the results of fonseca et al 2020 schwitalla et al 2020 the unified noah land surface model is implemented for land surface physics the kain fritsch cumulus scheme kain 2004 is active in the 12 km grid but is not employed in the 4 km domain there were 45 vertical levels with the lowest four levels at about 26 85 160 and 250 m above ground level a night time cold bias in the wrf model has previously been reported for this region weston et al 2019 fonseca et al 2019 have shown that modifications to the soil properties in arid areas can counter act this bias for instance a decrease in soil porosity reduces the air spaces between soil particles and effectively increases the thermal inertia of the surface the net effect is a decrease in the daytime maximum and an increase in the night time minimum temperatures the default soil texture in wrf is from the state soil geographic statsgo food and agriculture organization fao soil database dy and fung 2016 sanchez et al 2009 according to this dataset the soil texture in the uae is mostly sand loamy sand and sandy loam with some sections of clay near the coast however the results of an extensive local survey of soil texture reported most soil types as sand ead 2009 accordingly clay sandy loam and loamy sand soil types within the uae were converted to sand in the nested wrf domain fig 2 loam was left as is furthermore the soil porosity was decreased by 10 percent over sand and by 30 percent over loam 2 6 model verification 2 6 1 meteorological variables the model meteorological variables of temperature depression tdep rh wind speed dry bulb temperature t and dew point temperature td are verified against the metar observations and the bias mean gross error mge and root mean square error rmse was calculated for tdep rh the daily minimum maximum value was verified for wind speed hourly values from the morning window of 00 h00 to 08 h00 local time was verified 2 6 2 fog verification the aim of the verification conducted in this study is to assess the model s performance in providing an accurate forecast for the following day the model predictions from the closest grid point to the abu dhabi international airport are considered this means that 24 h from 16 h00 to 10 h00 next day lst 12 h00 to 06 h00 utc are considered as a valid forecast an 8 hour window from 00 h00 to 08 h00 lst is subset from the valid forecast to evaluate whether fog was present in the metar and was predicted by the model this corresponds to forecast hours 15 to 23 from these results the scores in the contingency table see table 2 are computed from which the probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far are calculated the probability of detection pod which is sometimes called hit rate is calculated as follows 3 pod total h i t s total h i t s t o t a l m i s s e s where 1 is the perfect score a score of 0 8 can be interpreted as 8 out of 10 observations are correctly predicted the false alarm ratio is calculated using the equation below 4 far total f a l s e a l a r m s total h i t s t o t a l f a l s e a l a r m s the optimal score for the far is 0 as it would indicate no false alarms and the theoretical maximum is 1 all events are false alarms a score of 0 4 can be interpreted as 4 out of 10 predicted events were not observed as a way of summarizing the results the euclidian distance to a perfect score is calculated as follows 5 euclidian d i s t a n c e 1 p o d 2 0 f a r 2 this is useful for evaluating cases that have different pod and far scores as the case with the shortest distance to a perfect score constitutes a better result 3 rule based method 3 1 summary of rules a summary of the rules is presented here as a reference table 3 the rationale for these rules are discussed in this section 3 2 dew point depression and wind speed dew point depression tdep and wind speed rules normally occur together for radiation fog dew point depression the difference between the air temperature and the dew point temperature is indicative of how close to saturation the air is with respect to water vapour dew point depression and relative humidity represent the same process in the atmosphere i e saturation and can be used interchangeably to define fog conditions a range in relative humidity from 90 to 100 corresponds to a tdep of 2 0 c some published rule based methods use relative humidity such as menut et al 2014 zhou and du 2010 zhou et al 2012 while others use dewpoint depression payra and mohan 2014 radiation fog requires calm conditions tardif and rasmussen 2007 and proposed thresholds of wind speed ws range from 1 to 3 ms 1 menut et al 2014 payra and mohan 2014 zhou and du 2010 zhou et al 2012 an analysis of the metar data showed that the 100th percentile for tdep under fog conditions was 2 c fig 3 a this was used as the tdep threshold in defining the first rule similarly the 90th percentile for wind speed was 3 1 ms 1 an initial threshold of 2 8 ms 1 was tested as per payra and mohan 2014 before increasing to 3 ms 1 these thresholds are used in the static threshold rules it is evident from fig 3 that there is an overlap between fog and non fog conditions in particular for the wind speed this is a limitation of the rule based method as non fog conditions will always be captured in the threshold sample and therefore limit the verification scores even if the model produced a perfect forecast a sliding rule was proposed as an alternative to the static thresholds where the thresholds change according to a category as tdep is decreased the density of data points at higher wind speeds increased during fog events fig 4 three categories were defined with the following ranges for tdep wind speed 0 2 c 0 2 ms 1 0 1 c 0 3 ms 1 0 c 3 5 ms 1 if any of the three conditions occur it is assumed there is fog in the model 3 3 atmospheric stability the radiosonde data was analysed to check for the suitability of using a mri threshold of 0 04 highlighted with a black line in fig 5 the red dots represent fog cases that are captured by the threshold of 0 04 the green dots on the other hand indicate fog events that have a mri between 0 001 and 0 037 from this analysis we conclude that the 0 04 threshold could be too restrictive for diagnosing fog at this site thus an extra threshold of 0 001 was tested as an additional rule a mri greater than zero means that a temperature inversion is present and the wind speed becomes less important an argument can be made that if a temperature inversion is present and is sufficiently established there is no need to include the wind speed and associated wind shear as the atmosphere is already stable furthermore wind speed is already accounted for independently in the static rules and is not required as part of the stability rule this led to adding an additional parameter to classify atmospheric stability which is the depth of the nocturnal surface inversion layer z inv this excludes wind speed or the inversion strength and simply makes use of the depth of the inversion layer weston et al 2021 reported that surface inversions are deeper during fog events than during clear sky conditions at abu dhabi airport one reason that may explain the deeper inversion layer during fog conditions is turbulence which promotes mixing below the top of the inversion a few authors have indicated that some amount of turbulence is required for fog to form e g gultepe et al 2007 haeffelin et al 2013 while too much turbulence will inhibit or dissipate fog e g zhou and ferrier 2008 in some cases a minimum wind speed and associated turbulence was identified in order for fog to form payra and mohan 2014 report that wind speed should be 1 4 ms 1 terpstra 1999 report 1 ms 1 and haefflin et al 2013 report 0 5 ms 1 zhou and ferrier 2008 show that turbulence has a positive correlation with the depth of saturated air near the surface furthermore they indicate that fog is inhibited when the saturated air depth is shallow 100 m we have not included a rule that represents the depth of saturated air as this would require us to use the liquid water content in the model however accounting for the depth of moisture near the surface may be considered in future studies we run a sensitivity test using threshold values of 150 m and 250 m above ground level for the depth of the inversion layer referred to as z inv in the results section 3 4 relative humidity and visibility results of the metar analysis at auh show the challenge of fitting a line to the data as the range in visibility is large at similar relative humidity fig 6 this may be in part due to a lack of precision in the metar data the relative humidity is derived from the dry bulb and dew point temperatures where the dew point temperature does not contain decimal places in metar observations the discontinuity of relative humidity in fig 6 is attributed to this loss of precision in dew point temperature this adds an additional challenge in fitting a curve to this data set nevertheless the application of a linear relationship in the low visibility range of this data set proved to be helpful the results of the sensitivity analysis for a range of values of m and c are presented in table 4 the best scores for pod far of 0 85 0 33 were achieved with m 0 166 and c 16 66 if the far was 0 5 or higher it means that half the forecasts are false alarms and hence the method is not suitable to be employed the results of this analysis indicate the best possible score that the model can achieve if using the visibility rule the straight line is effectively the same as using a static threshold for humidity of 94 this converts to a tdep of about 1 4 c which was not possible to test in the observed data due to the referred lack of precision the range of visibility at similar relative humidity indicates that there are other driving forces to the fog formation clark et al 2008 included the aerosol number in conjunction with relative humidity when defining visibility as aerosol loading affects fog formation aerosol information is not available at this site however other measurements in the country indicate that surface condensation nuclei loading is high throughout winter and that the fine aerosols are hygroscopic filioglou et al 2020 hamdan et al 2018 kaku et al 2016 this equation was applied to the model forecast and is referred to as the vis rule although it is representing a static threshold of 94 1 4 c for rh tdep 4 model verification 4 1 wrf meteorological verification the statistical verification of the daily minimum maximum of tdep rh is presented in table 5 along with the hourly verification of wind speed over all the mornings the tdep is shown to have a cold negative bias with a mean gross error mge of 1 7 c on fog mornings only the tdep has a warm positive bias with a mge of 1 13 c similarly rh has an overall positive bias with mge of 7 82 but a negative bias on fog mornings with mge of 5 29 the td mge positive bias on all days and non fog days is larger than the t mge this is in agreement with the rh mge and bias on these same days and can be the reason for the negative tdep mge on fog days the t mge positive bias is larger than the td mge which may result in a larger tdep than observed and the reported positive bias wind speed has an overall positive bias and mge of 1 23 ms 1 and on fog mornings the bias is positive with a mge of 0 90 ms 1 4 2 wrf fog verification the rules in table 3 were applied to the observed data and the results are reported in table 6 the rationale of applying the rules to the observations is to indicate the best case scenario for the model if it performed perfectly for all the parameters in general rules containing the vis rh threshold rules 9 through 14 outperformed the static and sliding combinations 1 through 8 with rules 12 vis ws3 and 9 vis performing the best with a pod far of 0 89 0 24 0 28 respectively rules 10 11 and 13 vis z 250m vis z 150m and vis z 250m ws3 performed equally with pod far of 0 69 0 14 in general rules that include mri 0 001 i e an inversion is present outperformed mri 0 04 rules e g 5 vs 3 and 15 vs 14 if the presence of an inversion is extrapolated to include the depth of the inversion the far is further decreased e g rule 5 vs 7 and 14 vs 11 the static and sliding rules provide the highest pod 0 8 and 0 71 respectively and a good starting point in terms of far 0 58 and 0 54 table 7 further changes are needed to achieve a far below 0 5 which is accomplished in some cases through the introduction of the atmospheric stability parameter the addition of the mri 0 04 criterion rules 3 4 reduces the far to below 0 5 for both the static and sliding rules while using 0 001 as a threshold for the mri rules 5 6 maintains a far above 0 5 this suggests that mri 0 001 is too lenient the sliding rule with mri 0 04 rule 4 is eliminated due to a low pod score which suggests that this combination is too restrictive the addition of the z inv 250 m condition rules 7 8 achieves similar results to the static mri 0 004 rule rule 3 but returns a lower distance score thus the mri rule is not required at this site this pattern is reiterated when discussing the visibility rule below the general conclusion from these comparisons is that the static rule outperforms the sliding rule and that the inversion depth can be used in place of the mri for atmospheric stability the visibility rule is essentially a more restrictive version of the static rule where relative humidity needs to be greater than or equal to 94 which equates to a tdep threshold of about 1 4 c it is found that the visibility rule combined with a higher wind speed threshold of 3 ms 1 performed better than the previous threshold of 2 8 ms 1 better far and distance not shown however when the visibility rule is combined with the inversion depth z inv 250 m rule 13 it outperforms the visibility ws3 rule 12 based on lower distance this indicates that the stable atmosphere parameter holds more weight than the wind speed in diagnosing fog from the model a sensitivity test to compare an inversion depth of 150 m and 250 m was conducted and showed that the 250 m threshold performed better e g rules 10 and 11 all these parameters were combined and the final rule with the best performance was rule 13 visibility z inv250m ws3 this met the criteria with a pod far of 0 62 0 37 and the lowest euclidian distance of 0 5304 rule 13 compared well to the observed pod far of 0 69 0 14 table 6 and is most likely limited by the performance of rh during fog days for example rule 9 vis only achieved a pod of 0 68 in the model compared to 0 89 in the observed data future improvements in the model parameterisaton schemes may further improve the prediction of rh and hence the performance of this rule as already discussed the visibility rule is the same as using a static threshold of 94 for relative humidity rule 16 confirmed this and showed the same results as rule 13 the use of liquid water content as a rule 17 performed the worst with pod far of 0 37 0 31 in this case the rule based method out performs the use of lwc to diagnose fog in the model a comparison of the observed fog days with the fog days from the model obtained with rule 13 indicates that the rule is applicable throughout the verification period fig 7 it generates hits in early season october mid season december and january and at the end of the season march notable performance is that february and november 2017 did not have any observed events and the model did not generate any false alarms in these months in contrast february 2018 had four fog days and the model did not capture any of these upon inspection it was noted that the model tdep was larger than observations during february 2018 and no fog events were captured by the rule fig 7 the reason for this bias is not clear yet but may be due to some larger scale variability that is not captured in the simulations the results of previous rule based studies discussed in the introduction are summarized in fig 8 along with this study while the methodologies vary widely between these studies e g model resolution number of stations for verification etc it does provide context on the model performance the comparison shows that the results from this study are in the favorable range where pod is greater than 0 6 and far is below 0 5 furthermore the comparison indicates that simulations with longer lead times to the fog events return better scores in the case of the uae the longer lead time makes sense as the fog formation depends on the advection of moisture during the day preceding the night time fog event in addition the cooling cycle of the land is included in the forecast which should capture the fog events in the forecast a fog forecast study from the uae by bartok et al 2012 is included in their study fog was diagnosed using visibility from the pafog model and not a rule based method it is interesting to note the high far from bartok et al 2012 while their study makes use of visibility which is assumed to be derived from the cloud microphysics it seems that their model system is overactive in the fog forecast as pointed out earlier for fog and non fog conditions tdep and wind speed ranges overlap in the uae which also results in an overactive forecast this was constrained through the addition of stricter thresholds and the inclusion of the inversion depth parameter thus the rule based method is shown to be useful in situations where fog forecasts are overactive an important consideration regarding forecast assessment is its final application for example in terms of road safety does a false alarm or a missed event hold more weight if missed events are less desirable then less restrictive rules can be implemented at the cost of increasing the false alarms this will require more input from the forecaster with regards to decision making it would require an analysis of the economic impact of the forecast through a cost loss analysis e g zhou et al 2012 such an analysis is beyond the scope of this study 4 3 spatial comparison with satellite in this section the rule 13 is applied to all data points in the model domain to create a fog mask a qualitative comparison is then made to the meteosat 10 seviri false colour composite fog product an extensive fog patch occurred on 2017 01 04 which extended from the coast to about 200 km inland at the southern border with saudi arabia fig 9 a the fog occurs over land and does not extend over the gulf waters where the air temperature is warmer this was a missed event in the model which although it does not capture the fog at abu dhabi it does capture the inland fog this suggests that although the rule is based on observations at abu dhabi it can be applied to the wider model domain a similar event was observed on 2016 12 30 fig 9 c and was recorded as a hit in the forecast in this case the model fog patch was along the coast and did no capture the inland fog fig 9 d not all fog events extend inland as is the case on 2016 12 27 fig 9 e f which occurs along the coast here the model captures the fog mask quite well from the examples presented here it seems that the model captures the inland fog more often than not and that the geophysical parameters in rule 13 are representing the physical process of fog formation fig 9 and fig 10 it often occurs that the fog patch does not extend continuously from west to east across the uae but rather features separate elements concentrated in specific regions fig 10 the reason for these patches could be related to the location of onshore flow or more precisely the inhibition of onshore flow for example steinhoff et al 2018 demonstrated that the position of a surface low pressure over the gulf can inhibit moisture transport over the eastern half of the uae while promoting it over the western half this blocking mechanism mostly occurs in summer but similar blocking mechanisms are most likely present in winter months similar circulation has been reported for summer june july and up to october reid et al 2008 schwitalla et al 2020 for our cases there is a clear boundary in the satellite rgb between fog and no fog that is representative of a change in physical conditions e g moisture or temperature as the model is based on geophysical parameters it appears to capture this boundary in the forecast fog patch for some cases this suggests that there is a realism in the model simulations of these events the conclusion from this qualitative analysis is that the multi rule based method can produce realistic fog patches provided the model bias is within the threshold values 5 summary diagnosing fog from numerical weather prediction models is a challenge some approaches rely on liquid water content or diagnosing visibility as a model output another option is to use a multi rule based approach where several criteria must be met in order to diagnose fog in this paper we test a range of multi rule based methods for forecasting next day fog at abu dhabi international airport in the united arab emirates a range of rules were tested and evaluated against metar observations at abu dhabi international airport a combination of the following variables were used to define a rule dew point depression relative humidity wind speed modified richardson index depth of inversion layer and liquid water content the worst performing rule was rule 17 where liquid water content was greater than 0 g kg this produced a pod far of 0 37 0 31 the best performing rule was rule 13 16 where relative humidity 94 wind speed 3 ms 1 and the depth of the inversion layer 250 m are required for fog to be present at the site the rule show no seasonal bias and achieved a pod far score of 0 62 0 37 for forecasting fog on the following day this is a good result in comparison to other rule based studies with similar forecast lead times of about 14 h the depth of the inversion layer added value in defining fog conditions for this site inversion depth performed better in combination with relative humidity than with a wind speed or mri condition an inherent limitation of the rule based method is that fog and non fog conditions can exhibit similar geophysical conditions as a result the far was never lower than 0 3 in the model performance fog formation occurred at around forecast hour 20 for these simulations a comparison with other studies showed similar forecast hours were required 20 to 30 for forecasts with pod 0 7 this makes sense for radiation fog events that require the cooling cycle to be captured in the simulation for an accurate forecast rule 13 was extended to the model domain and the fog mask was compared qualitatively against seviri rgb fog products this showed that the rule did well in capturing most of the observed fog patches with the exception of february 2018 furthermore the modelled and observed fog patches exhibit clearly defined borders suggesting that the geophysical parameters used to diagnose fog are also simulated well in the model this indicates that there is a realism in the model simulations of fog events the multi rule based method is useful in this case for diagnosing fog and performed better than using liquid water content alone if model performance of selected geophysical parameters e g tdep are further improved through model parameterisation this method will be even more robust thus further improvement of the model meteorological variables will be useful in this case funding funding from

4615,a reliable fog forecast can assist in water resource management and mitigate against hazardous effects on transport networks however diagnosing fog from numerical weather prediction models remains a challenge and various methods have been developed to achieve this one approach is to use a multi rule based method where threshold values of multiple variables are employed to define fog conditions in the forecast such a method is presented here for next day forecasts of radiation fog at abu dhabi in the united arab emirates variables tested include the dew point depression wind speed modified richardson index inversion depth relative humidity and liquid water content of these the best performing rule included relative humidity 94 wind speed 3ms 1 and inversion depth 250 m with a probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far of 0 62 0 37 the worst performing rule was liquid water content with a pod far of 0 37 0 31 model performance was more sensitive to inversion depth than wind speed and rules that included inversion depth performed better than rules that included the modified richardson number a qualitative spatial analysis showed that rules produced realistic fog patches when compared to satellite images this suggests that the geophysical parameters chosen to define rules are well suited for defining fog as long as the model bias is sufficiently small to fall within the threshold values this method worked well for the study region and did not demonstrate any seasonal bias keywords radiation fog operational forecast rule based method lwc visibility tdep wrf arid region 1 introduction a reliable fog forecast can assist in water resource management and mitigate against hazardous effects on transport networks gultepe et al 2009 gultepe et al 2007 westcott and kristovich 2009 de villiers and van heerden 2007 stolaki et al 2009 however diagnosing fog from numerical weather prediction models remains a challenge bergot et al 2015 bergot et al 2007 yang et al 2010 and various methods have been developed to achieve this one approach is to use a multi rule based method where threshold values of multiple variables are employed to define fog conditions in the forecast e g zhou and du 2010 such a method is presented here for next day forecasts of radiation fog at abu dhabi in the united arab emirates fog is defined as conditions where visibility is less than 1000 m due to the presence of water droplets world meteorological organization 2008 it is the most extreme condition of low visibility from condensation followed by mist 1 km vis 5 km and haze vis 5 km haze is due to high water vapour mixing ratio but relative humidity is below 90 historically fog is difficult to diagnose from mesoscale model variables bergot et al 2015 bergot et al 2007 yang et al 2010 one option for defining fog in the model is to use the cloud water mixing ratio sometimes referred to as liquid water content lwc in the lowest model level if positive or in excess of a given threshold fog is deemed to be present at the site a variant of this method is to integrate the cloud water mixing ratio over a set of model levels instead of just taking the value at the lowest level an approached followed e g by yang et al 2010 however mesoscale models are often too coarse in resolution to solve this condensation process explicitly or display deficiencies in the physical parameterization at these scales e g bergot et al 2017 furthermore the challenge to separate fog from mist and haze still remains the final desired model diagnostic of a fog forecast is visibility many visibility equations have been published based on observations using lwc as the main dependent variable with variations that include water vapour mixing ratio wind speed or relative humidity rh clark et al 2008 gultepe and milbrandt 2007 stoelinga et al 1999 bang et al 2009 smirnova et al 2000 gultepe et al 2006 a visibility forecast provides actionable information to end users the physics of visibility is based on mie theory and the associated extinction efficiency related to particle size however in situ information on particle size is scarce and has been shown to vary from case to case at a single location e g zhang et al 2014 the main drawback of this approach is again the dependence on model performance of lwc droplet number and droplet size distribution this has led to the development of visibility equations based on relative humidity in place of droplet information e g bang et al 2009 bieringer et al 2006 smirnova et al 2000 alternatively a multi variable rule based method can be used where model variables within a certain range or below a predefined threshold indicate fog conditions as was first proposed by croft et al 1997 this approach has been shown to improve forecast skill compared to lwc methods zhou and du 2010 zhou and du 2010 defined a set of variables to represent fog conditions for the different types of fog described by tardif and rasmussen 2007 for fog to be present either of the following conditions need to be met i lwc 0 015 g kg 1 or ii cloud top 400 m and cloud base 50 m or iii 10 m wind speed 2 m s 1 and 2 m rh 90 these three categories accounted for types of fog like advection stratus lowering or ground fog the hit rate or probability of detection pod the fraction of the fog events that are successfully predicted by the model optimal score of 1 using these criteria ranged from 0 1 to 0 6 which was overall higher than using a lwc 0 criteria for fog the false alarm ratio the fraction of the model forecasts that turned out not to be correct optimal score of 0 ranged from about 0 4 to 0 65 for these criteria which was about the same as the lwc 0 method baker et al 2002 used a different set of criteria to diagnose radiation fog which accounted for vertical mixing of moisture and atmospheric stability firstly like zhou and du s third condition they assume that the surface relative humidity is above 95 and that wind speed is calm and below 3 ms 1 in addition they define two new parameters the cross over temperature which is the 2 m dew point temperature during the warmest hours of the day and a modified richardson index which indicates vertical stability due to temperature and wind speed the thresholds proposed for these two new parameters are tcrossover 1 66 c and 0 04 respectively although they do not report on model performance we will discuss more on the use of the modified richardson parameter in the methodology section as it proves useful for radiation fog cases payra and mohan 2014 used i near surface relative humidity gradient rh2 meters rhsurface 4 5 ii 10 meter wind speed 1 4 2 8 ms 1 iii near surface temperature gradient tsurface t2 meters 0 c and iv dew point depression less than 8 c criteria to define fog over northern india and reported high pod results in excess of 90 however they do not state the false alarm ratio which we assume to be high as well menut et al 2014 added a new rule to diagnose fog which is the rate of cooling in the hours preceding radiation fog events in paris their main aim was to model pre fog conditions and they found that the cooling rate of 2 m temperature should be 0 5 c over a 3 h period in addition and due to the availability of measurements at their sites of interest they required the net infrared flux to be 10 wm 2 which means that surface cooling should be occurring the rh 2 m 90 and 10 m wind speed 3 ms 1 their best model pod far scores were 0 58 0 37 to 0 74 0 37 which corresponds to the best performance so far for a multi rule based approach interestingly they also applied these thresholds to the observed data at their site and reported a pod far of 0 87 0 39 in other words if the model simulated the observations exactly this is the theoretical best performance that can be achieved with the employed criteria and thresholds román cascón et al 2016 later applied the same criteria to two sites in europe one in the netherlands and one in spain when using the same threshold values their model forecast pod far scores were 0 20 0 10 and 0 34 0 17 for the netherlands and spain respectively which is a rather poor forecast performance however when applied to the observed data the pod far scores were 0 86 0 21 and 0 64 0 14 respectively which is a very good result due to the poor model performance they adjusted the threshold values based on observations collected at the sites and later improved the model pod far scores to 0 86 0 37 and 0 59 0 35 for netherlands and spain respectively the observed pod far scores also improved to 82 1 30 6 and 73 9 22 3 respectively while criteria variables remained the same in this instance the optimum threshold can change from site to site which can only be determined if site specific observations are available in this paper a rule based application of diagnosing fog from an operational version of the weather research and forecasting wrf model is presented the rules are based on commonly available variables from automatic weather stations and soundings so that the method is transferable to other locations with similar measurements the performance of the next day s forecast is assessed against station data from abu dhabi s international airport and the results are discussed with reference to previous studies that are summarized above finally a qualitative spatial comparison of the model fog mask and the satellite rgb image is presented the work is structured as follows in section 2 a description of the observational datasets the rule based method and the setup of the wrf model is presented in section 3 the thresholds employed for each criterion are determined in section 4 the performance of the wrf model is evaluated a summary of the main findings is given in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 study area the united arab emirates uae is an arid country located on the northeastern edge of the arabian peninsula fig 1 with a mean annual rainfall of about 78 mm year ouarda and charron 2014 wehbe et al 2017 wehbe et al 2018 it covers an area of 83 600 km2 which is mostly sparse to bare vegetation and the main soil type is sand and loamy sand it relies heavily on groundwater and desalination as sources of fresh water and treated sewage effluent for irrigation aldababseh et al 2018 despite being an arid region the mean water vapour mixing ratio can reach 11 18 g kg in winter summer and the region experiences frequent fog in winter which can extend over most of the country aldababseh and temimi 2017 bartok et al 2012 de villiers and van heerden 2007 weston et al 2021 abu dhabi s international airport experiences radiation fog de villiers and van heerden 2007 between 8 and 51 days per year weston et al 2021 the sea breeze transports moisture from the arabian gulf to the interior and can penetrate 130 km inland eager et al 2008 while fog can extend up to about 200 km inland at the southern border with saudi arabia e g weston and temimi 2020 fog in the uae forms under calm conditions on winter nights the clear night sky combined with the high albedo desert surface means that the air temperature drops quickly at night this leads to the formation of nocturnal inversion layers which trap advected moisture near the surface eg temimi et al 2020 moisture is transported in during the day with the sea breeze at night the return land breeze is weaker and often calm fog is most frequent at the coldest time of the night just before sunrise and dissipates shortly after sunrise de villiers and van heerden 2007 weston et al 2021 the emirates have an expanding agricultural sector and have utilized groundwater waste water and desalinated water aldababseh et al 2018 fog harvesting sites in neighboring saudi arabia captured between 2 500 and 3 200 l of water in less than three months during the fog season gandhidasan and abualhamayel 2012 however fog harvesting has yet to be considered as a source of fresh water to supplement agricultural irrigation in the uae the study site is abu dhabi s international airport auh which is located on the mainland coast line in abu dhabi city the airport is at the edge of the city and is mostly surrounded by bare ground rather than urban area the airport has meteorological aerodrome reports metar hourly observations that include standard atmospheric state measurements along with visibility and weather codes 2 2 study period the study period covered 10 winter months 303 days over two seasons the first season is from december 2016 to march 2017 and the second season is october 2017 to march 2018 during this period 35 fog days were recorded at auh 2 3 data sets 2 3 1 metar data metar observations from auh were used to identify fog conditions and for model verification data was downloaded from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national climatic data center ncdc database ncei 2001 these reports include visibility measurements and a weather code indicating the presence of fog table 1 fog was defined as conditions where visibility was less than or equal to 1000 m and one of the fog codes were present both parameters are required to define fog as low visibility can also occur due to dust events or rainfall events relative humidity cannot be used to define fog events as it is high during rainfall events 2 3 2 radiosonde radiosonde data was used to characterize vertical profiles of temperature during fog and clear sky conditions this was conducted to see if there is a difference in surface layer inversion characteristics under fog conditions that may be helpful in defining fog rules furthermore the vertical temperature profiles forms part of the modified richardson index described in section 3 3 which is a parameter used to define some rules seventeen years of data from 2000 to 2017 were obtained from the university of wyoming s website oolman 2019 the 00 utc sounding was analysed as it corresponds to 04 h00 local standard time lst roughly when fog forms at the site e g chaouch et al 2016 weston et al 2019 profiles for fog conditions were identified by matching the date of fog days from the metar data described above clear sky conditions were defined as days that lacked cloud cover codes in the metar defined as ovc overcast or 8 8 bkn broken or 7 8 sct scattered or 4 8 and few few or 2 8 and lacked the fog code 2 3 3 seviri the fog product night microphysical from the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri instrument on board meteosat 10 situated over 9 5 e was utilized for this study schmetz et al 2002 the resolution is about 4 km and images are available every 15 min in this fog product the red channel is the difference between 12 0 and 10 8 µm channels linear stretch 4 to 2 k the green channel is the difference between 10 8 and 3 9 µm channels linear stretch 0 to 10 k and the blue channel is the 10 8 µm channel linear stretch 243 to 293 k this is used for a qualitative assessment of the spatial extent of the model predicted fog extent 2 4 defining rules in the rule based approach threshold values are defined for selected variables namely the 2 meter dew point depression 10 meter horizontal wind speed atmospheric stability and visibility a combination of these thresholds defines a rule in order to determine suitable threshold values at the site the metar data was analyzed for fog and non fog conditions the metar data was analyzed for the years 2000 2016 and for the months of october to march excluding december 2016 which is included in the model results these months are when fog activity is highest and the sample period excludes the modelling period frequency distributions of surface variables dew point depression and wind speed are calculated and act as a guide for selecting a suitable threshold the results of this analysis are presented in section3 radiation fog occurs under stable conditions to represent the vertical stratification of the atmosphere baker et al 2002 introduced a modified richardson index mri which accounts for the vertical temperature gradient and wind shear and is defined as 1 mri t b t sfc u 1 943 2 where tb boundary layer temperature c where boundary layer is at either 900 hpa or psfc 35 hpa pressure level tsfc surface temperature c and u surface wind speed in ms 1 values of mri above 0 04 are considered stable 0 025 0 04 are indicative of marginally stable conditions and 0 025 corresponds to a mixed layer the mri was calculated at auh using a combination of the metar and radiosonde data the suitability of the 0 04 value was assessed for fog cases at the auh site the results of the analysis are presented in section 3 radiosonde data was analyzed from january 2000 to march 2017 a linear relationship between relative humidity and visibility was defined from the metar observations visibility in kilometers was calculated using a linear equation where relative humidity is the independent variable eq 2 visibility was assumed to be 0 m when relative humidity was 100 2 vis m r h c when rh 85 where m is the slope and c is the y intercept a visibility equation normally includes an exponential function over a large range in visibility 0 10 km bang et al 2009 clark et al 2008 gultepe et al 2006 smirnova et al 2000 smith et al 2002 stoelinga et al 1999 however fog cases occur on a short segment of the exponential curve and near the y limit i e low visibility which can be treated as a linear segment a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the observed rh data by perturbing m and c and assessed against observed fog events a contingency table was constructed for a time window of 00 to 12 local time if fog was reported in this window and the visibility was 1000 m it is considered a hit the probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far were calculated from the contingency table the equation with the best score was applied to model output as the visibility rule for defining fog it is assumed that rules are relevant over land only as they are based on observations reported at a land based station marine fog is not considered at any level in the design or evaluation of the rules 2 5 wrf model a two nest configuration of 12 and 4 km fig 1 with one way feedback is run with wrf v4 1 2 skamarock et al 2019 only results from the 4 km domain are analyzed and presented in this paper simulations are initialized at 06 utc with the 0 25 gfs version 14 ncep 2015 and run for 48 h the first 30 h from the forecast are selected for verification excluding the first 6 h which allow for model spin up chaouch et al 2016 weston et al 2019 land cover classes are taken from the united states geological survey usgs global database loveland et al 2000 sertel et al 2010 model physics parameterization included the rapid radiative transfer model for general circulation model applications rrtmg for short wave radiation and rrtm for longwave radiation iacono et al 2008 mlawer et al 1997 the quasi normal scale elimination qnse planetary boundary layer pbl scheme is implemented with its associated surface layer physics scheme sukoriansky et al 2005 chaouch et al 2016 tested seven pbl parameterization schemes for five fog events in auh and found that the qnse scheme gave the best results for fog events in the region capturing the vertical temperature and moisture profiles at abu dhabi the regular thompson cloud microphysics scheme is employed thompson et al 2008 following the results of fonseca et al 2020 schwitalla et al 2020 the unified noah land surface model is implemented for land surface physics the kain fritsch cumulus scheme kain 2004 is active in the 12 km grid but is not employed in the 4 km domain there were 45 vertical levels with the lowest four levels at about 26 85 160 and 250 m above ground level a night time cold bias in the wrf model has previously been reported for this region weston et al 2019 fonseca et al 2019 have shown that modifications to the soil properties in arid areas can counter act this bias for instance a decrease in soil porosity reduces the air spaces between soil particles and effectively increases the thermal inertia of the surface the net effect is a decrease in the daytime maximum and an increase in the night time minimum temperatures the default soil texture in wrf is from the state soil geographic statsgo food and agriculture organization fao soil database dy and fung 2016 sanchez et al 2009 according to this dataset the soil texture in the uae is mostly sand loamy sand and sandy loam with some sections of clay near the coast however the results of an extensive local survey of soil texture reported most soil types as sand ead 2009 accordingly clay sandy loam and loamy sand soil types within the uae were converted to sand in the nested wrf domain fig 2 loam was left as is furthermore the soil porosity was decreased by 10 percent over sand and by 30 percent over loam 2 6 model verification 2 6 1 meteorological variables the model meteorological variables of temperature depression tdep rh wind speed dry bulb temperature t and dew point temperature td are verified against the metar observations and the bias mean gross error mge and root mean square error rmse was calculated for tdep rh the daily minimum maximum value was verified for wind speed hourly values from the morning window of 00 h00 to 08 h00 local time was verified 2 6 2 fog verification the aim of the verification conducted in this study is to assess the model s performance in providing an accurate forecast for the following day the model predictions from the closest grid point to the abu dhabi international airport are considered this means that 24 h from 16 h00 to 10 h00 next day lst 12 h00 to 06 h00 utc are considered as a valid forecast an 8 hour window from 00 h00 to 08 h00 lst is subset from the valid forecast to evaluate whether fog was present in the metar and was predicted by the model this corresponds to forecast hours 15 to 23 from these results the scores in the contingency table see table 2 are computed from which the probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far are calculated the probability of detection pod which is sometimes called hit rate is calculated as follows 3 pod total h i t s total h i t s t o t a l m i s s e s where 1 is the perfect score a score of 0 8 can be interpreted as 8 out of 10 observations are correctly predicted the false alarm ratio is calculated using the equation below 4 far total f a l s e a l a r m s total h i t s t o t a l f a l s e a l a r m s the optimal score for the far is 0 as it would indicate no false alarms and the theoretical maximum is 1 all events are false alarms a score of 0 4 can be interpreted as 4 out of 10 predicted events were not observed as a way of summarizing the results the euclidian distance to a perfect score is calculated as follows 5 euclidian d i s t a n c e 1 p o d 2 0 f a r 2 this is useful for evaluating cases that have different pod and far scores as the case with the shortest distance to a perfect score constitutes a better result 3 rule based method 3 1 summary of rules a summary of the rules is presented here as a reference table 3 the rationale for these rules are discussed in this section 3 2 dew point depression and wind speed dew point depression tdep and wind speed rules normally occur together for radiation fog dew point depression the difference between the air temperature and the dew point temperature is indicative of how close to saturation the air is with respect to water vapour dew point depression and relative humidity represent the same process in the atmosphere i e saturation and can be used interchangeably to define fog conditions a range in relative humidity from 90 to 100 corresponds to a tdep of 2 0 c some published rule based methods use relative humidity such as menut et al 2014 zhou and du 2010 zhou et al 2012 while others use dewpoint depression payra and mohan 2014 radiation fog requires calm conditions tardif and rasmussen 2007 and proposed thresholds of wind speed ws range from 1 to 3 ms 1 menut et al 2014 payra and mohan 2014 zhou and du 2010 zhou et al 2012 an analysis of the metar data showed that the 100th percentile for tdep under fog conditions was 2 c fig 3 a this was used as the tdep threshold in defining the first rule similarly the 90th percentile for wind speed was 3 1 ms 1 an initial threshold of 2 8 ms 1 was tested as per payra and mohan 2014 before increasing to 3 ms 1 these thresholds are used in the static threshold rules it is evident from fig 3 that there is an overlap between fog and non fog conditions in particular for the wind speed this is a limitation of the rule based method as non fog conditions will always be captured in the threshold sample and therefore limit the verification scores even if the model produced a perfect forecast a sliding rule was proposed as an alternative to the static thresholds where the thresholds change according to a category as tdep is decreased the density of data points at higher wind speeds increased during fog events fig 4 three categories were defined with the following ranges for tdep wind speed 0 2 c 0 2 ms 1 0 1 c 0 3 ms 1 0 c 3 5 ms 1 if any of the three conditions occur it is assumed there is fog in the model 3 3 atmospheric stability the radiosonde data was analysed to check for the suitability of using a mri threshold of 0 04 highlighted with a black line in fig 5 the red dots represent fog cases that are captured by the threshold of 0 04 the green dots on the other hand indicate fog events that have a mri between 0 001 and 0 037 from this analysis we conclude that the 0 04 threshold could be too restrictive for diagnosing fog at this site thus an extra threshold of 0 001 was tested as an additional rule a mri greater than zero means that a temperature inversion is present and the wind speed becomes less important an argument can be made that if a temperature inversion is present and is sufficiently established there is no need to include the wind speed and associated wind shear as the atmosphere is already stable furthermore wind speed is already accounted for independently in the static rules and is not required as part of the stability rule this led to adding an additional parameter to classify atmospheric stability which is the depth of the nocturnal surface inversion layer z inv this excludes wind speed or the inversion strength and simply makes use of the depth of the inversion layer weston et al 2021 reported that surface inversions are deeper during fog events than during clear sky conditions at abu dhabi airport one reason that may explain the deeper inversion layer during fog conditions is turbulence which promotes mixing below the top of the inversion a few authors have indicated that some amount of turbulence is required for fog to form e g gultepe et al 2007 haeffelin et al 2013 while too much turbulence will inhibit or dissipate fog e g zhou and ferrier 2008 in some cases a minimum wind speed and associated turbulence was identified in order for fog to form payra and mohan 2014 report that wind speed should be 1 4 ms 1 terpstra 1999 report 1 ms 1 and haefflin et al 2013 report 0 5 ms 1 zhou and ferrier 2008 show that turbulence has a positive correlation with the depth of saturated air near the surface furthermore they indicate that fog is inhibited when the saturated air depth is shallow 100 m we have not included a rule that represents the depth of saturated air as this would require us to use the liquid water content in the model however accounting for the depth of moisture near the surface may be considered in future studies we run a sensitivity test using threshold values of 150 m and 250 m above ground level for the depth of the inversion layer referred to as z inv in the results section 3 4 relative humidity and visibility results of the metar analysis at auh show the challenge of fitting a line to the data as the range in visibility is large at similar relative humidity fig 6 this may be in part due to a lack of precision in the metar data the relative humidity is derived from the dry bulb and dew point temperatures where the dew point temperature does not contain decimal places in metar observations the discontinuity of relative humidity in fig 6 is attributed to this loss of precision in dew point temperature this adds an additional challenge in fitting a curve to this data set nevertheless the application of a linear relationship in the low visibility range of this data set proved to be helpful the results of the sensitivity analysis for a range of values of m and c are presented in table 4 the best scores for pod far of 0 85 0 33 were achieved with m 0 166 and c 16 66 if the far was 0 5 or higher it means that half the forecasts are false alarms and hence the method is not suitable to be employed the results of this analysis indicate the best possible score that the model can achieve if using the visibility rule the straight line is effectively the same as using a static threshold for humidity of 94 this converts to a tdep of about 1 4 c which was not possible to test in the observed data due to the referred lack of precision the range of visibility at similar relative humidity indicates that there are other driving forces to the fog formation clark et al 2008 included the aerosol number in conjunction with relative humidity when defining visibility as aerosol loading affects fog formation aerosol information is not available at this site however other measurements in the country indicate that surface condensation nuclei loading is high throughout winter and that the fine aerosols are hygroscopic filioglou et al 2020 hamdan et al 2018 kaku et al 2016 this equation was applied to the model forecast and is referred to as the vis rule although it is representing a static threshold of 94 1 4 c for rh tdep 4 model verification 4 1 wrf meteorological verification the statistical verification of the daily minimum maximum of tdep rh is presented in table 5 along with the hourly verification of wind speed over all the mornings the tdep is shown to have a cold negative bias with a mean gross error mge of 1 7 c on fog mornings only the tdep has a warm positive bias with a mge of 1 13 c similarly rh has an overall positive bias with mge of 7 82 but a negative bias on fog mornings with mge of 5 29 the td mge positive bias on all days and non fog days is larger than the t mge this is in agreement with the rh mge and bias on these same days and can be the reason for the negative tdep mge on fog days the t mge positive bias is larger than the td mge which may result in a larger tdep than observed and the reported positive bias wind speed has an overall positive bias and mge of 1 23 ms 1 and on fog mornings the bias is positive with a mge of 0 90 ms 1 4 2 wrf fog verification the rules in table 3 were applied to the observed data and the results are reported in table 6 the rationale of applying the rules to the observations is to indicate the best case scenario for the model if it performed perfectly for all the parameters in general rules containing the vis rh threshold rules 9 through 14 outperformed the static and sliding combinations 1 through 8 with rules 12 vis ws3 and 9 vis performing the best with a pod far of 0 89 0 24 0 28 respectively rules 10 11 and 13 vis z 250m vis z 150m and vis z 250m ws3 performed equally with pod far of 0 69 0 14 in general rules that include mri 0 001 i e an inversion is present outperformed mri 0 04 rules e g 5 vs 3 and 15 vs 14 if the presence of an inversion is extrapolated to include the depth of the inversion the far is further decreased e g rule 5 vs 7 and 14 vs 11 the static and sliding rules provide the highest pod 0 8 and 0 71 respectively and a good starting point in terms of far 0 58 and 0 54 table 7 further changes are needed to achieve a far below 0 5 which is accomplished in some cases through the introduction of the atmospheric stability parameter the addition of the mri 0 04 criterion rules 3 4 reduces the far to below 0 5 for both the static and sliding rules while using 0 001 as a threshold for the mri rules 5 6 maintains a far above 0 5 this suggests that mri 0 001 is too lenient the sliding rule with mri 0 04 rule 4 is eliminated due to a low pod score which suggests that this combination is too restrictive the addition of the z inv 250 m condition rules 7 8 achieves similar results to the static mri 0 004 rule rule 3 but returns a lower distance score thus the mri rule is not required at this site this pattern is reiterated when discussing the visibility rule below the general conclusion from these comparisons is that the static rule outperforms the sliding rule and that the inversion depth can be used in place of the mri for atmospheric stability the visibility rule is essentially a more restrictive version of the static rule where relative humidity needs to be greater than or equal to 94 which equates to a tdep threshold of about 1 4 c it is found that the visibility rule combined with a higher wind speed threshold of 3 ms 1 performed better than the previous threshold of 2 8 ms 1 better far and distance not shown however when the visibility rule is combined with the inversion depth z inv 250 m rule 13 it outperforms the visibility ws3 rule 12 based on lower distance this indicates that the stable atmosphere parameter holds more weight than the wind speed in diagnosing fog from the model a sensitivity test to compare an inversion depth of 150 m and 250 m was conducted and showed that the 250 m threshold performed better e g rules 10 and 11 all these parameters were combined and the final rule with the best performance was rule 13 visibility z inv250m ws3 this met the criteria with a pod far of 0 62 0 37 and the lowest euclidian distance of 0 5304 rule 13 compared well to the observed pod far of 0 69 0 14 table 6 and is most likely limited by the performance of rh during fog days for example rule 9 vis only achieved a pod of 0 68 in the model compared to 0 89 in the observed data future improvements in the model parameterisaton schemes may further improve the prediction of rh and hence the performance of this rule as already discussed the visibility rule is the same as using a static threshold of 94 for relative humidity rule 16 confirmed this and showed the same results as rule 13 the use of liquid water content as a rule 17 performed the worst with pod far of 0 37 0 31 in this case the rule based method out performs the use of lwc to diagnose fog in the model a comparison of the observed fog days with the fog days from the model obtained with rule 13 indicates that the rule is applicable throughout the verification period fig 7 it generates hits in early season october mid season december and january and at the end of the season march notable performance is that february and november 2017 did not have any observed events and the model did not generate any false alarms in these months in contrast february 2018 had four fog days and the model did not capture any of these upon inspection it was noted that the model tdep was larger than observations during february 2018 and no fog events were captured by the rule fig 7 the reason for this bias is not clear yet but may be due to some larger scale variability that is not captured in the simulations the results of previous rule based studies discussed in the introduction are summarized in fig 8 along with this study while the methodologies vary widely between these studies e g model resolution number of stations for verification etc it does provide context on the model performance the comparison shows that the results from this study are in the favorable range where pod is greater than 0 6 and far is below 0 5 furthermore the comparison indicates that simulations with longer lead times to the fog events return better scores in the case of the uae the longer lead time makes sense as the fog formation depends on the advection of moisture during the day preceding the night time fog event in addition the cooling cycle of the land is included in the forecast which should capture the fog events in the forecast a fog forecast study from the uae by bartok et al 2012 is included in their study fog was diagnosed using visibility from the pafog model and not a rule based method it is interesting to note the high far from bartok et al 2012 while their study makes use of visibility which is assumed to be derived from the cloud microphysics it seems that their model system is overactive in the fog forecast as pointed out earlier for fog and non fog conditions tdep and wind speed ranges overlap in the uae which also results in an overactive forecast this was constrained through the addition of stricter thresholds and the inclusion of the inversion depth parameter thus the rule based method is shown to be useful in situations where fog forecasts are overactive an important consideration regarding forecast assessment is its final application for example in terms of road safety does a false alarm or a missed event hold more weight if missed events are less desirable then less restrictive rules can be implemented at the cost of increasing the false alarms this will require more input from the forecaster with regards to decision making it would require an analysis of the economic impact of the forecast through a cost loss analysis e g zhou et al 2012 such an analysis is beyond the scope of this study 4 3 spatial comparison with satellite in this section the rule 13 is applied to all data points in the model domain to create a fog mask a qualitative comparison is then made to the meteosat 10 seviri false colour composite fog product an extensive fog patch occurred on 2017 01 04 which extended from the coast to about 200 km inland at the southern border with saudi arabia fig 9 a the fog occurs over land and does not extend over the gulf waters where the air temperature is warmer this was a missed event in the model which although it does not capture the fog at abu dhabi it does capture the inland fog this suggests that although the rule is based on observations at abu dhabi it can be applied to the wider model domain a similar event was observed on 2016 12 30 fig 9 c and was recorded as a hit in the forecast in this case the model fog patch was along the coast and did no capture the inland fog fig 9 d not all fog events extend inland as is the case on 2016 12 27 fig 9 e f which occurs along the coast here the model captures the fog mask quite well from the examples presented here it seems that the model captures the inland fog more often than not and that the geophysical parameters in rule 13 are representing the physical process of fog formation fig 9 and fig 10 it often occurs that the fog patch does not extend continuously from west to east across the uae but rather features separate elements concentrated in specific regions fig 10 the reason for these patches could be related to the location of onshore flow or more precisely the inhibition of onshore flow for example steinhoff et al 2018 demonstrated that the position of a surface low pressure over the gulf can inhibit moisture transport over the eastern half of the uae while promoting it over the western half this blocking mechanism mostly occurs in summer but similar blocking mechanisms are most likely present in winter months similar circulation has been reported for summer june july and up to october reid et al 2008 schwitalla et al 2020 for our cases there is a clear boundary in the satellite rgb between fog and no fog that is representative of a change in physical conditions e g moisture or temperature as the model is based on geophysical parameters it appears to capture this boundary in the forecast fog patch for some cases this suggests that there is a realism in the model simulations of these events the conclusion from this qualitative analysis is that the multi rule based method can produce realistic fog patches provided the model bias is within the threshold values 5 summary diagnosing fog from numerical weather prediction models is a challenge some approaches rely on liquid water content or diagnosing visibility as a model output another option is to use a multi rule based approach where several criteria must be met in order to diagnose fog in this paper we test a range of multi rule based methods for forecasting next day fog at abu dhabi international airport in the united arab emirates a range of rules were tested and evaluated against metar observations at abu dhabi international airport a combination of the following variables were used to define a rule dew point depression relative humidity wind speed modified richardson index depth of inversion layer and liquid water content the worst performing rule was rule 17 where liquid water content was greater than 0 g kg this produced a pod far of 0 37 0 31 the best performing rule was rule 13 16 where relative humidity 94 wind speed 3 ms 1 and the depth of the inversion layer 250 m are required for fog to be present at the site the rule show no seasonal bias and achieved a pod far score of 0 62 0 37 for forecasting fog on the following day this is a good result in comparison to other rule based studies with similar forecast lead times of about 14 h the depth of the inversion layer added value in defining fog conditions for this site inversion depth performed better in combination with relative humidity than with a wind speed or mri condition an inherent limitation of the rule based method is that fog and non fog conditions can exhibit similar geophysical conditions as a result the far was never lower than 0 3 in the model performance fog formation occurred at around forecast hour 20 for these simulations a comparison with other studies showed similar forecast hours were required 20 to 30 for forecasts with pod 0 7 this makes sense for radiation fog events that require the cooling cycle to be captured in the simulation for an accurate forecast rule 13 was extended to the model domain and the fog mask was compared qualitatively against seviri rgb fog products this showed that the rule did well in capturing most of the observed fog patches with the exception of february 2018 furthermore the modelled and observed fog patches exhibit clearly defined borders suggesting that the geophysical parameters used to diagnose fog are also simulated well in the model this indicates that there is a realism in the model simulations of fog events the multi rule based method is useful in this case for diagnosing fog and performed better than using liquid water content alone if model performance of selected geophysical parameters e g tdep are further improved through model parameterisation this method will be even more robust thus further improvement of the model meteorological variables will be useful in this case funding funding from

4616,studying fog requires a good understanding of both its horizontal and vertical distributions among these two the vertical one is the most challenging to observe different methods have been adopted for observing this variable among which the most commonly used are satellite datasets together with airborne and meteorological surface observations yet all these techniques present significant limitations as for spatial and temporal resolution when describing the vertical fog structure in this manuscript we introduce the ground optical fog observation system gofos a new method to describe the advective fog s frequency and vertical distribution this tool is based on in situ optical observations taking advantage of the topography of the atacama desert coastal mountains where advective fog is frequent during 2017 the gofos reported a fog presence 10 during summer and of 50 during winter also the gofos shows a diurnal variability of fog presence that decreases around noon and increases again starting from the afternoon the vertical structure observed by the gofos shows a cloud depth of 250 m subject to diurnal and seasonal variabilities by analyzing gofos results through a comparison with the ones obtained by standard observations a 93 agreement was found between the fog frequencies detected by the gofos and goes also we found a 80 consistency between gofos fog frequency values and marine boundary layer regimes related to fog formation moreover we observed that the cloud base height estimated by the gofos is correlated with the iquique airport ceilometer measurements r 0 6 finally the mean cloud top height estimated by the gofos differs by 8 from the antofagasta airport radio soundings measurements these results provide useful information for the selection of optimal sites for fog harvesting and for getting a better understanding of the interactions between fog and its ecosystem in conclusion through this study the gofos demonstrated its potential as a simple reliable and affordable method for systematic fog monitoring that might also be adapted to different topographic conditions keywords fog observation cloud vertical structure standard meteorological observations advective fog coastal atacama 1 introduction fog is a meteorological phenomenon defined by a dense boundary layer cloud in permanent contact with the earth s surface roach 1994 stull 1988 different conditions of the atmospheric boundary layer can originate three types of fogs radiative fog forms from air masses cooling in contact with a cold surface under stable atmospheric conditions roach et al 1976 bruijnzeel et al 2005 orographic fog forms under steep terrain conditions where air masses lift while cooling down cereceda et al 2002 likewise the well known marine stratocumulus cloud deck forms large fog banks when interacting with higher enough reliefs generating advective fog bruijnzeel et al 2005 the variety of conditions in which fog occurs determines its worldwide distribution eugster 2008 klemm et al 2012 and creates the opportunity for addressing it under different research perspectives fog studies have largely focused on the impact of fog on the development of certain economic activities associated with land and aerial transport bendix 2002 more recently the scientific community has focused on the study of fog as a potential untapped freshwater resource this research field is becoming more and more relevant in relation to climate change studies especially for water stressed areas as in the case of the coast of the atacama desert 18 30 s 71 w schemenauer and cereceda 1994a larraín et al 2002 cereceda et al 2008a klemm et al 2012 marzol 2002 marzol and sánchez 2008 del río et al 2018 on this coast we mainly find the advective fog formed as a result of the combination of three physical processes firstly the subsidence of warm air related to the se pacific anticyclone interacts with the cold wet and well mixed marine boundary layer mbl generating a thermal inversion layer cereceda et al 2002 2008a garreaud et al 2008 muñoz et al 2016 lobos et al 2018 del río et al 2018 secondly the newly formed thermal inversion enhanced by the long wave radiative cooling promotes the formation of semi permanent stratocumulus sc clouds in the se pacific ocean duynkerke et al 1995 garreaud et al 2008 2011 garreaud and muñoz 2004 serpetzoglou et al 2008 finally predominant s sw winds transport the sc cloud towards the coast of the atacama desert where the cloud intercepts the coastal mountain this interaction leads to the formation of advective fog whose diurnal variability is strongly influenced by the ocean land thermodynamics lobos et al 2018 rutllant et al 2003 muñoz et al 2016 the vertical structure of the sc cloud has already been explored serpetzoglou et al 2008 bretherton et al 2010 rutllant and garreaud 2005 garreaud et al 2011 muñoz et al 2011 2016 rutllant et al 2003 conversely less is known about sc cloud distribution when interacting with the coastal cordillera topography forming advective fog lobos et al 2018 cereceda et al 2008a 2008b a better understanding of advective fog frequency and its vertical structure is important for detecting where the fog mostly occurs and for characterizing its diurnal evolution and seasonality this knowledge is essential for localizing optimal sites for fog harvesting marzol 2005 schemenauer joe 1989 schemenauer cereceda 1994b additionally the presence of fog within the coast of the atacama desert supports a unique natural ecosystem rich in biodiversity and endemism schulz et al 2011a muñoz schick et al 2001 pinto et al 2006 koch et al 2019 this ecosystem is particularly sensitive to environmental variations related to nutrient and water inputs that depend on the fog latorre et al 2011 as a consequence the knowledge of cloud vertical variations has a high conservation value in this sense we can conclude that fog frequency and vertical distribution are relevant in terms of climate change biodiversity conservation and freshwater sources larraín et al 2002 schulz et al 2011b klemm et al 2012 the study of advective fog or stratocumulus fog cloud scf in this paper as a potential freshwater source requires an accurate understanding of horizontal and vertical fog distribution among these the vertical component is the most challenging variation to measure this has been studied before by using different methods and combinations of them namely satellite images as well as surface and airborne observations gultepe et al 2007 the most frequently used method to obtain an scf horizontal scale is the analysis of satellite images on one hand satellites optimally describe the seasonal and diurnal fog cycles as well as fog frequency bendix 2002 farías et al 2005 torregrosa et al 2015 del río et al 2018 on the other hand the analysis of these images presents significant limitations in describing the fog vertical structure bendix et al 2005 cermark 2007 as for the surface observations method i e meteorological stations this is more suitable for measuring local meteorological variables allowing accurate site specific characterizations of fog with high temporal resolution yet this method reveals its limitations when it comes to characterizing the vertical fog structure for extended areas for example a large number of weather stations fog collectors and cloud radars are needed for a regional scale fog study schween et al 2020 leading to increased economic costs airborne observations are so far the best alternative for measuring the vertical structure of scf clouds although they present severe limitations in terms of temporal resolution given that the vertical distribution of the scf is very dynamic thus losing accuracy in describing diurnal cycles moreover the frequently used radiosoundings are typically launched from airports or flatlands thus providing results that do not consider the influence of topography within this paper we propose a new method called ground optical fog observation system gofos for measuring frequency and vertical components of the scf while addressing some of the issues listed above the results derived from the testing of this method have been validated through standard methods and observations thanks to this analysis we could observe how the gofos combines the synchronous high temporal resolution of surface observations with vertical observations taking advantage of the local topography through this study we aim to answer the following question how does the gofos perform characterizing the scf frequency and its vertical structure the article is structured as follows in section 2 the gofos instrumentation and operation are described together with the relative data processing within section 3 the results regarding scf frequency and vertical distribution are shown within section 4 the gofos performance is analyzed by comparing its results with the ones obtained through standard methods finally in section 5 the main conclusions of this study are presented together with gofos potential future applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 gofos instrumentation and installation the ground optical fog observation system gofos was installed in the coastal cordillera of the atacama desert at 15 to 20 km from the coastline and between 600 and 1350 m above the sea level asl where advective fog can be found fig 1 a and b the gofos is composed of two optical time lapse cameras configured to acquire an image every 10 min and a series of solar powered lights that automatically activate in the dark the cameras brinno protlc are installed on a plastic tripod and connected to a 10 w solar panel for getting continuous power supply fig 1c the light system is installed on a 1 5 m galvanized iron pole and it consists of 44 leds configured in a red mode supplied by a 6 w solar panel fig 1d the cameras are strategically placed in two sites at 1350 m asl 20 580429 s 70 029714 w and at 600 m asl 20 627451 s 70 058907 w the choice of these specific locations permits the observation of both the top and the base of the stratocumulus clouds fig 1b covering the 750 m height range that corresponds to the area of stratocumulus fog scf presence cereceda et al 2008b these cameras oversee a transect of pole lights located every 50 m along the slope from 600 to 1350 m asl the top camera frames from e to w i e towards the pacific ocean nine pole lights located between 850 m and 1250 m asl the bottom camera frames from w to e a profile of pole lights installed between 650 m and 900 m asl the observation of the well defined fog day cycle with higher frequencies during the afternoon night and dawn cereceda et al 2008a is performed through different methods during night and day times a night image showing lights indicates the absence of fog contrarily assuming that lights can be covered by the fog itself the same night image without lights shown indicates the presence of fog as for day images by taking into account the exact location and height of the pole lights in the slope it is possible to visually determine the presence or absence of scf as well as the level height of the cloud top ct and cloud base cb moreover if the cameras capture images composed of fog only i e foggy blank images scf presence is recorded at the correspondent location and height in summary the cameras observations indicate the stratocumulus fog cloud presence the ct and cb heights and the cloud depth cd the top camera captured images from august 2016 to january 2018 whereas the bottom one captured images from january 2017 to january 2018 2 2 data processing initially a subset of 5080 pictures acquired by gofos cameras was manually processed to obtain a database of ct cb and cd measures more specifically the 5080 pictures were labeled by a supervisor who determined the presence or absence of fog for each sample additionally pictures were manually classified as either night or day images for the night ones a binary classification was done by visual inspection of the pole light elevation corresponding to each picture according to this classification the value 1 corresponding to non visible light indicates fog presence fig 2 b and d and the value 0 corresponding to visible light indicates fog absence fig 2a and c the previous data subset was used to run a deep learning model based on a convolutional neural network an algorithm that had already been successful used in several weather image interpretation processes liu et al 2016 shi et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 the model was run using the python programming language python software foundation https www python org and an architecture based on the one proposed by shi et al 2016 the neural network received as input specific cropped regions of pictures where the pole lights were located returning as output the correspondent probability of fog presence according to these outputs if the probability was lower than 25 no fog was detected if the probability was higher than 75 the fog was detected if the probability was between 25 and 75 the software let the user supervisor determine the presence or absence of fog after running the fully automated classification process the following quality statistics have been obtained accuracy correct

correct p o s i t i v e s correct p o s i t i v e s f a l s e n e g a t i v e s 80 53 in case of uncertainties due to dimmed lights or lights interacting with cloud boundaries the software was configured so that the user could manually classify the images fig 2e and f improving the algorithm s performance to avoid false negatives detections then the binary results were automatically systematized into a database the remaining pictures nearly 32 000 were automatically classified by the model whereas for daylight pictures the entire binary classification was performed manually finally diurnal and nocturnal datasets were unified the presence of fog was confirmed if at least one of the observations diurnal and nocturnal corresponded to the binary value 1 this method was used to calculate the scf frequency for a determined time period an hour a day or a month for example 50 of an hour of fog presence corresponds to 3 observations taken every 10 min reporting the value 1 50 of a day of fog presence corresponds to 72 observations reporting the value 1 and 50 of a month of fog presence corresponds to 2160 measurements with value 1 the heights of ct and cb were estimated through the highest and lowest synchronic fog observations respectively finally the cd was calculated based on the corresponding cb and ct values 2 3 supporting data for gofos validation to validate our observations and critically analyze gofos performance we compared its results with datasets listed and summarized in table 1 obtained by surface airborne and satellite observations in this way we analyzed gofos detections in terms of scf frequency ct and cb 2 3 1 scf frequency as for the fog frequency gofos results were compared with different data derived from surface observations and satellite images table 1 for the comparison with surface observations results we used values of air temperature relative humidity and air pressure recorded by two weather stations the first of these ones is located at 50 m asl at iquique airport 20 54917 s 70 16944 w and 15 km from the gofos it is administrated by the meteorological direction of chile dmc and it has been recording 10 minutes resolution data since 1981 fig 1b the second fully equipped weather station operating with the same time resolution was installed in november 2016 at 1 220 m asl 20 491615 s 70 058724 w and 10 km from the gofos firstly we follow the methodology suggested by lobos et al 2018 which defines marine boundary layer regimes related to fog formation or dissipation these regimes are based on a threshold derived from thermal and moisture gradients over a vertical section of the mbl the reference thresholds for fog formation are 0 0031 k m 1 and 0 0016 g kg 1 m 1 thus we calculated the two marine boundary layer mbl fog regimes well mixed fog formation or stratified fog dissipation these results have been modified according to the thresholds derived by gofos observations using this information we compared our results for scf presence with the ones obtained from well mixed and stratified fog regimes these regimes are calculated by estimating the potential temperature θ and specific humidity q from both weather stations over a vertical gradient from 50 m to 1220 m asl subsequently we calculated the θ and q values per vertical meter thanks to this data we could classify the abl fog

airport this dataset is the result of a systematic visual observation performed by an operator of the airport every hour for the whole year 2017 these datasets belong to the dmc to estimate the scf frequency we detected fog presence if oktas values were 7 being 8 8 the maximum cloud cover value in combination with a low cloud condition cb altitude 1500 m asl recorded by the oktas operator finally we compared the scf frequency obtained by the gofos with results derived from geostationary operational environmental satellite goes images we calculated the scf frequency reported by the goes in february and september 2017 respectively the lowest and highest fog season month in the coastal atacama desert cereceda et al 2008a for each of these two months five images per day captured at 00 39 04 39 07 39 12 39 and 19 39 local time lt were processed to represent the fog diurnal cycle farias et al 2005 as for the nocturnal cycle the scf detection was obtained through a widely used method based on the difference between short 3 8 µm and long 10 9 µm thermal infrared wavelengths eyre 1984 ellrod 1995 lee et al 1997 anthis and cracknell 1999 bendix 2002 underwood et al 2004 del río et al 2018 this method classifies as low clouds the pixels presenting both low bright 2 µm and high temperature 273 k jedlovec and laws 2003 torregrosa et al 2015 on the other hand the diurnal scf identification was based on change detection techniques contrasting each image with 100 cloud free ones 2 3 2 cloud base to analyze gofos measurements of the cb height we compared these with two other surface observation data sources table 1 the first dataset is obtained by a ceilometer located within iquique airport this instrument administrated by the dmc recorded cb values every hour from august to december 2017 the second dataset came from standard meteorological observations taken by the airport weather station located at 50 m asl based on such observations we applied the methodology suggested by wetzel and boone 1995 and already utilized by lobos et al 2018 for calculating the lift condensation level lcl on the coast of the atacama desert doing so we assume the lcl to be the base of the scf cloud lobos et al 2018 2 3 3 cloud top to validate the ct heights estimated by the gofos we compared these with the radiosoundings dataset belonging to dmc of cerro moreno airport antofagasta 23 45361 s 70 44056 w these radiosoundings measurements are taken daily at 12 00 utc 08 00 local time 330 km southern than the gofos ones fig 1a the analysis of this dataset for the whole 2017 revealed a thermal inversion layer height lower than or equal to 1400 m asl 3 results and discussions the advective fog in the atacama desert is characterized by scf frequency and vertical variability the complex terrain in which this phenomenon takes place represents a significant variable whose effects are difficult to observe and quantify within this context the gofos enables us to describe in situ scf variations in the following section gofos observations regarding scf frequency cloud top ct cloud base cb and cloud depth cd are reported 3 1 scf frequency according to the gofos gofos observations reveal remarkable seasonal and diurnal scf frequency cycles the seasonal cycle presents its minimum and its maximum during the austral summer and winter respectively fig 3 a fig 3a shows that the lowest scf frequencies occur during summer specifically in january 2 presence and february 1 5 presence the scf frequency starts to escalate fast at the end of autumn increasing more than double in a month the highest frequency values occur during winter in july 49 presence and august 50 presence during the southern spring from september to december this frequency constantly decreases until the beginning of summer it is interesting to observe how even though during spring the fog frequency is not the highest together with winter these two seasons correspond to a long fog period covering the second half of the year fig 3b shows scf diurnal cycle monthly means for representative months february for summer may for autumn august for winter and november for spring within these months the same diurnal cycles yet characterized by different magnitudes are observed during the diurnal cycle the highest scf frequency occurs during the night 00 00 06 00 lt the early morning 06 00 09 00 lt and the evening 19 00 00 00 lt conversely the lowest frequency occurs during the late morning and the afternoon 10 00 18 00 lt all the reported months except may present a fog frequency pick between 20 00 and 22 00 lt during may the pick occurs at dawn 06 00 09 00 lt during february and august a total absence of fog is reported from the morning to the afternoon slightly higher frequency values ranging from 3 to 5 are recorded at mid day 11 00 13 00 lt in may and in november the vertical distribution of the gofos along the coastal cordillera enables us to quantify the vertical variability of scf frequency revealing where fog regularly occurs fig 4 shows the annual scf frequency vertical variability observed through the gofos along the altitudinal pole lights transect for 2017 we notice that the scf frequency starts increasing at 600 m asl and reaches its highest value at 1000 m asl at 1000 m asl the frequency of scf starts to decline gradually until 1300 m asl at 1000 m asl the total annual frequency of scf is 30 consistently with the values represented in fig 3 we also noticed that locations below 700 m asl and above 1300 m asl present lower scf presence near 10 at 950 m asl the increment of scf frequency presents a discontinuity that might be due to a technical limitation of the gofos bottom system the absence of a light pole at this height if so a scf frequency between 20 and 25 would be expected at this point 3 2 vertical fog distribution gofos observations describe the seasonal diurnal cycles of vertical advective fog distribution fig 5 a shows the weekly average seasonal variability of cd measured from the ct to the cb these results reveal that the largest cd occurs during summer 315 m thick when the ct and cb are at their highest point fig 5a for example january february and march present average cds of 325 300 and 275 m respectively this gradual thinning of the cd is mainly due to the decreasing ct height while the cb one is steady during autumn cd values decrease reaching approximately 230 m due to both ct and cb height drops the cd decrease continues during winter cd 220 m together with the decline of ct and cb values during this season the cd reaches its minimum in august 170 m finally we notice that the spring average cd 230 m is slightly higher than the winter one fig 5b shows the average cd diurnal cycle during january in the graph we find some gaps indicating the absence of scf fig 3a and b also it is possible to observe that the scf is thicker in the afternoon i e 15 00 lt than in the morning while in june the development of the cd diurnal cycle is continuous over the day fig 5c this is due to the rapid scf rise occurring between 13 00 and 14 00 lt followed by a progressive decrease until midnight 20 00 24 00 lt finally during november fig 5d a continuous scf increase can be observed with the highest cd 400 m reached during the afternoon 14 00 18 00 lt fig 6 a shows the inverse relationship between ct diurnal cycle and fog frequency the lower higher the ct height the higher lower the scf frequency it is relevant to note that the highest recorded ct values is 1000 m of height consistently with the data showed in fig 4 as for the annual negative correlation between ct and scf frequency fig 6a the r2 of 0 40 p 0 005 increases until 0 60 p 0 005 if summer months are excluded from the analysis fig 6a also shows that the highest scf frequencies correspond to the lowest ct heights between 900 and 1100 m asl and that these frequencies increase mainly during the night when the ct is shallower conversely the lowest scf presence occurs between noon and the afternoon consistently with its diurnal cycle presented in fig 3b on the other hand fig 6b shows a low correspondence between the cb height and the scf frequency this means that these two variables are mainly independent of each other nevertheless as for the scf diurnal cycle we can observe that the cb one has a similar trend to the ct one fig 6a and b where the highest lowest frequency of scf presence occurs during the night and the morning noon afternoon fig 6c shows a positive correlation between the ct and cb height values the highest correspondence between these two variables occurs during the night and at dawn when scf regularly forms with ct at 1000 m of height and cb at 850 m of height the annual correlation between ct and cb values is characterized by an r2 of 0 44 p 0 005 while the monthly analysis report that 75 of the analyzed months present an r2 of 0 77 p 0 005 revealing a strong correlation between these variables 4 gofos and the standard stratocumulus and fog observations methods within this section we compare gofos observations of stratocumulus fog scf frequency cloud base cb and cloud top ct with the ones obtained through the standard methods introduced in section 2 3 and listed in table 1 4 1 scf frequency observed by the gofos and standard methods 4 1 1 the atmospheric boundary layer regimes we compared gofos observations of the scf frequency with the estimations of fog formation presence and dissipation absence classified through the marine boundary layer mbl regimes method by lobos et al 2018 section 2 3 eqs 1 and 2 for performing this comparison we only analyzed fog presence events whose ct is at least at 1220 m asl because the mbl regimes method requires the presence of weather stations below the ct for correct fog classification the scf presence observed through the gofos 467 total hours in 2017 87 corresponds with an mbl under moisture q well mixed regime whereas the correspondence decreases to 79 considering an mbl regime under thermal well mixed conditions we hypothesize that the higher agreement between gofos scf frequency observations and the q well mixed regime is due to the direct relationship existing between q and the fog the high consistency between gofos results and both θ and q well mixed regimes indicates that scf has a high possibility 80 to form when q and θ within the mbl are lower than 1 88 g kg 1 and 3 65 k respectively yet we observe seasonal and diurnal variabilities of these results fig 7 shows the distribution of the analyzed cases of both scf frequency and mbl regimes for january june and november representative months for summer winter and spring respectively on one hand analyzing january data fig 7a we notice that 12 out of the 14 cases present a correspondence between θ well mixed regimes and scf frequency reaching an 85 agreement between these two datasets on the other hand the results reveal a 50 consistency between the q well mixed regime and scf frequency as for june fig 7b the agreement between θ well mixed regime and scf frequency decreases to 64 whereas a 77 consistency with q well mixed regimes is found finally in november fig 7c both well mixed regimes reach their highest agreement with gofos scf frequency observations 95 for the q well mixed regime and 85 for the θ well mixed regime as for the diurnal variabilities of well mixed regimes and gofos observations table 2 shows their average agreement for january june and november in general high correspondence is found during the evening night transition where gofos results are more consistent with q well mixed regimes than with the θ well mixed ones data related to january 2017 show less scf presence together with a significant correspondence between the mbl regimes method and gofos observations in june the mbl regimes method reports higher daily scf presence and lower agreement with gofos observations finally in november the mbl regimes technique shows the highest scf presence and the best correspondence with gofos dataset these results are consistent with the ones obtained by lobos et al 2018 over the same study area during 2015 4 1 2 satellite dataset and oktas observations the scf presence measured by the gofos was compared with the ones recorded through goes satellite datasets and oktas observations from iquique airport the processed goes images define scf frequency within the study area over the gofos and oktas working ranges which correspond to one goes cell size pixel of 1 4 km as for the oktas dataset we considered observations reporting a cloud cover 7 to correspond to scf presence we performed two different kinds of comparisons between february and september monthly averages of the scf frequency to estimate these averages we analyzed five images per day taken by the goes at 0 39 04 39 07 39 12 39 19 39 local time gofos measurements taken every 10 min and oktas hourly observations firstly we correlated the results obtained by goes with the ones derived by the gofos secondly we compared oktas and goes monthly means for each of the five goes images for the corresponding 5 moments of the day table 3 shows monthly scf frequency means estimated by goes for the two study fields over the gofos installation and in the iquique airport area during september goes results show slightly less scf frequency than gofos and oktas measurements reaching a 93 agreement with these two even though gofos and oktas monthly mean estimations are based on significantly more data the analysis of satellite images at selected hours represents an effective method for describing the monthly scf frequency as for the monthly average diurnal cycles the highest difference between goes and gofos results occurs at sunset nevertheless the observations taken during the rest of the day show a high agreement among these two datasets reaching a 100 correspondence at noon also comparing results obtained by goes and the oktas we find high agreement among these two at night nearly 100 agreement but such correspondence decreases at noon and sunset the comparison between gofos and oktas results shows that the oktas detected a higher scf frequency both as monthly and daily averages except for the measurements taken at sunset the higher scf frequency shown by the oktas may be due to the location from which the two measurements were taken since iquique airport is located on the coastal plain 3 km from the coastline where oceanic conditions dominate and the land heat influence is lower on the other hand the gofos is located over the coastal cordillera 15 20 km onshore where the topography and the land heating significatively influence the dissipation of the fog lobos et al 2018 the scf diurnal cycles defined by oktas and gofos observations reveal the described geographic influence showing similar percentages of scf frequency at night and dawn such results are associated with scf inland advection events farías et al 2005 conversely the biggest difference between observations obtained through these two methods occurs at noon when solar radiation dissipates the scf as for february 2017 the comparison between gofos oktas and goes results should be interpreted cautiously due to a low scf frequency within the study area yet scf presence monthly means show a strong agreement between goes and gofos results since both datasets report a 1 5 of scf frequency for this month as for the comparison between goes and oktas results the scf frequency reported by goes is about 50 lower than the one obtained by the oktas measurements table 3 as for scf frequency monthly hourly means goes shows a similar level of agreement with both gofos and oktas values since observations obtained through these last two techniques present identical scf frequencies at night and different ones at dawn noon and sunset gofos and oktas measurements provide a site specific estimation of scf presence the precision of the results obtained through these techniques would be difficult to equal through satellite data sources yet satellite datasets allow us to monitor and understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of the scf phenomenon 4 2 cloud base observed through the gofos and surface observations within this section we compare cb values obtained by the gofos with the ones obtained through two other techniques the ceilometer and the lift condensation level lcl method firstly we compare our cb results with measurements taken by a ceilometer in the airport of iquique secondly we use meteorological data provided by iquique airport to estimate the lcl wetzel and boone 1995 assuming it to correspond to the base of stratocumulus clouds section 2 3 fig 8 shows boxplots of the cb height monthly means derived by both gofos and ceilometer results from august to december 2017 we found an expected positive correlation between both datasets r 0 6 95 confidence level yet this analysis shows how the cb height indicated by the gofos is on average 80 m higher than the one measured by the ceilometer such a difference might be due to topographic reasons since the mountain barrier present in the study area forces the scf to rise cereceda et al 2008b as for the comparison between the cb values estimated through the lcl method cblcl and the ones described by the gofos cbgofos we generally observe lower cblcl these results are shown in fig 9 together with a comparison between ct measurements obtained by the gofos and by the antofagasta airport radiosounding this comparison is analyzed in the next section moreover table 4 summarizes the descriptive statistics related to the comparison shown in fig 9 the mean cb values observed by the gofos differ only by 7 from the cb values estimated through the lcl methods being the cbgofos higher than the cblcl table 4 this difference is due to the influence that topography exerts over the cb rising its value fig 1b also both these methods report similar standard deviations 76 m for gofos results and 80 m for the ones obtained through the lcl method comparing the cb extreme values derived from the two datasets we observe that the maximum cb height detected through both methods almost coincide while minimum values differ by 9 from each other finally analyzing the interquartile area 25 50 and 75 we observe large differences of 100 m probably caused by the seasonal scf variability affecting both methods 4 3 cloud top observed by the gofos and radiosounding finally we compared ct observations derived from the gofos ctgofos with the ones obtained by the antofagasta airport radiosoundings ctrs this comparison is shown in fig 9 and summarized in table 4 where it is possible to observe that the ctgofos mean is 80 m higher than the ctrs one to analyze this mismatch three factors are taken into account firstly we have to carefully take into consideration the different latitudes of the two observation points the gofos one is approximately 330 km further n than the antofagasta airport and the annual displacement of the se pacific anticyclone which causes an increase of the ct height from s to n garreaud et al 2008 however we believe that no significant differences are generated by the latitudinal variation since both locations present similar synoptic and geographical conditions secondly rs are launched from the coastal plain while gofos measurements are taken from the coastal cordillera where local topography influences the ct height thirdly the difference between observation times plays a significant role in determining the contrast between ctgofo and ctrs values since ctgofos results are based on observations taken for all hours of fog events whereas ctrs values are based on 08 00 lt measurements only when the boundary layer is likely to be shallow it is possible to conclude that higher ctgofos values are justified by the influence of topography moreover comparing ct mean heights obtained through these two methods we notice about an 8 difference among their results the standard deviation of both methods is also similar analyzing their extreme values it emerges that the respective cts differ of maximum 100 m and minimum 30 m between gofos and rs results finally the trends shown within the interquartile area are consistent with these observations 60 100 m 5 conclusions in this paper we present the gofos as a new method for describing fog frequency and vertical distribution combining the advantages of high temporal resolution of surface observations with the ones given by the peculiar geography of the coastal atacama desert this technique characterizes the vertical elevation range of the stratocumulus cloud providing direct observations of the advective fog presence the height of the cloud base cb and the one of the cloud top ct such information allows us for the first time to characterize in situ the vertical distribution of the scf phenomenon a high agreement was found between gofos fog frequency results and the ones measured through standard methods reaching 93 correspondence between gofos and goes datasets likewise there is a consistency between gofos observations and the ones obtained through the marine boundary layer mbl regimes method for studying fog formation and dissipation this agreement reaches 87 when comparing observations made by the gofos with specific humidity well mixed regimes on the other hand gofos results are 79 consistent with potential temperature well mixed regimes this two ways validation may be further explored to improve the mbl regimes method for obtaining a better classification of the scf formation or dissipation the gofos is also presented as a reliable method for determining vertical scf cloud variability by setting the highest fog frequency at 1000 m asl this frequency is consistent with the highest ct and the thinnest cd means during the fog season june november as for the cb this maintains a steady state along the annual cycle on the other hand cb is significantly variable within its diurnal cycle where the highest scf frequency occurs during the night and morning and the lowest scf frequency occurs during the noon and afternoon in agreement with the highest ct s observations gofos observations of scf vertical distribution demonstrated to be consistent with results obtained by more commonly used methods finally the gofos can well describe the influence of topography on scf dynamics nevertheless this method presents some uncertainties firstly only the clouds located within gofos installation range can be analyzed this limited coverage reduces the capacity of observation of the method secondly a better description of the scf vertical variability would be obtained through a higher resolution than the one provided by the gofos 50 m vertical resolution thirdly the gofos location which significantly influences its results through topography and slope orientation might be considered as an exceptional one finally long term measurements 5 years would allow validating gofos results based on longer time series of data this would allow analyzing gofos performance in representing larger scale phenomena e g the enso phases moreover given the distance between the camera and the pole lights there might be a lag in the measurement despite these uncertainties the gofos was revealed to be a simple reliable and affordable technique thus this method represents a good alternative for the systematic and automatic monitoring of fog presence and its vertical distribution moreover the gofos can be adapted and improved for different topographic conditions potentials and projections related to this new method are described below the gofos allows us to better understand the relationship between scf vertical structure and frequency these data are useful to qualify potential areas for fog harvesting the gofos provides the possibility to relate scf vertical distribution to spatial changes in fog dependent ecosystems this knowledge significantly contributes to the study of the relationship between atmosphere and biosphere for better understanding past and future climatic changes the gofos contributes to the validation of other methodologies such as the mbl regimes method for classifying fog formation and dissipation two key variables for fog forecasting the gofos contributes to the validation of satellite datasets adding ground truth to the scf identification and characterization process local scale datasets provided by the gofos and the weather stations significantly contribute to our understanding of the physics of cloud formation these results could be improved by adding to the gofos installation more sensors measuring additional atmospheric variables such as temperature relative humidity wind speed and air pressure through this upgrade the gofos could better characterize the thermodynamics of the scf vertical profile providing fundamental knowledge for the understanding of fog presence and its physical characteristics such as its liquid water content credit authorship contribution statement camilo del río felipe

4616,studying fog requires a good understanding of both its horizontal and vertical distributions among these two the vertical one is the most challenging to observe different methods have been adopted for observing this variable among which the most commonly used are satellite datasets together with airborne and meteorological surface observations yet all these techniques present significant limitations as for spatial and temporal resolution when describing the vertical fog structure in this manuscript we introduce the ground optical fog observation system gofos a new method to describe the advective fog s frequency and vertical distribution this tool is based on in situ optical observations taking advantage of the topography of the atacama desert coastal mountains where advective fog is frequent during 2017 the gofos reported a fog presence 10 during summer and of 50 during winter also the gofos shows a diurnal variability of fog presence that decreases around noon and increases again starting from the afternoon the vertical structure observed by the gofos shows a cloud depth of 250 m subject to diurnal and seasonal variabilities by analyzing gofos results through a comparison with the ones obtained by standard observations a 93 agreement was found between the fog frequencies detected by the gofos and goes also we found a 80 consistency between gofos fog frequency values and marine boundary layer regimes related to fog formation moreover we observed that the cloud base height estimated by the gofos is correlated with the iquique airport ceilometer measurements r 0 6 finally the mean cloud top height estimated by the gofos differs by 8 from the antofagasta airport radio soundings measurements these results provide useful information for the selection of optimal sites for fog harvesting and for getting a better understanding of the interactions between fog and its ecosystem in conclusion through this study the gofos demonstrated its potential as a simple reliable and affordable method for systematic fog monitoring that might also be adapted to different topographic conditions keywords fog observation cloud vertical structure standard meteorological observations advective fog coastal atacama 1 introduction fog is a meteorological phenomenon defined by a dense boundary layer cloud in permanent contact with the earth s surface roach 1994 stull 1988 different conditions of the atmospheric boundary layer can originate three types of fogs radiative fog forms from air masses cooling in contact with a cold surface under stable atmospheric conditions roach et al 1976 bruijnzeel et al 2005 orographic fog forms under steep terrain conditions where air masses lift while cooling down cereceda et al 2002 likewise the well known marine stratocumulus cloud deck forms large fog banks when interacting with higher enough reliefs generating advective fog bruijnzeel et al 2005 the variety of conditions in which fog occurs determines its worldwide distribution eugster 2008 klemm et al 2012 and creates the opportunity for addressing it under different research perspectives fog studies have largely focused on the impact of fog on the development of certain economic activities associated with land and aerial transport bendix 2002 more recently the scientific community has focused on the study of fog as a potential untapped freshwater resource this research field is becoming more and more relevant in relation to climate change studies especially for water stressed areas as in the case of the coast of the atacama desert 18 30 s 71 w schemenauer and cereceda 1994a larraín et al 2002 cereceda et al 2008a klemm et al 2012 marzol 2002 marzol and sánchez 2008 del río et al 2018 on this coast we mainly find the advective fog formed as a result of the combination of three physical processes firstly the subsidence of warm air related to the se pacific anticyclone interacts with the cold wet and well mixed marine boundary layer mbl generating a thermal inversion layer cereceda et al 2002 2008a garreaud et al 2008 muñoz et al 2016 lobos et al 2018 del río et al 2018 secondly the newly formed thermal inversion enhanced by the long wave radiative cooling promotes the formation of semi permanent stratocumulus sc clouds in the se pacific ocean duynkerke et al 1995 garreaud et al 2008 2011 garreaud and muñoz 2004 serpetzoglou et al 2008 finally predominant s sw winds transport the sc cloud towards the coast of the atacama desert where the cloud intercepts the coastal mountain this interaction leads to the formation of advective fog whose diurnal variability is strongly influenced by the ocean land thermodynamics lobos et al 2018 rutllant et al 2003 muñoz et al 2016 the vertical structure of the sc cloud has already been explored serpetzoglou et al 2008 bretherton et al 2010 rutllant and garreaud 2005 garreaud et al 2011 muñoz et al 2011 2016 rutllant et al 2003 conversely less is known about sc cloud distribution when interacting with the coastal cordillera topography forming advective fog lobos et al 2018 cereceda et al 2008a 2008b a better understanding of advective fog frequency and its vertical structure is important for detecting where the fog mostly occurs and for characterizing its diurnal evolution and seasonality this knowledge is essential for localizing optimal sites for fog harvesting marzol 2005 schemenauer joe 1989 schemenauer cereceda 1994b additionally the presence of fog within the coast of the atacama desert supports a unique natural ecosystem rich in biodiversity and endemism schulz et al 2011a muñoz schick et al 2001 pinto et al 2006 koch et al 2019 this ecosystem is particularly sensitive to environmental variations related to nutrient and water inputs that depend on the fog latorre et al 2011 as a consequence the knowledge of cloud vertical variations has a high conservation value in this sense we can conclude that fog frequency and vertical distribution are relevant in terms of climate change biodiversity conservation and freshwater sources larraín et al 2002 schulz et al 2011b klemm et al 2012 the study of advective fog or stratocumulus fog cloud scf in this paper as a potential freshwater source requires an accurate understanding of horizontal and vertical fog distribution among these the vertical component is the most challenging variation to measure this has been studied before by using different methods and combinations of them namely satellite images as well as surface and airborne observations gultepe et al 2007 the most frequently used method to obtain an scf horizontal scale is the analysis of satellite images on one hand satellites optimally describe the seasonal and diurnal fog cycles as well as fog frequency bendix 2002 farías et al 2005 torregrosa et al 2015 del río et al 2018 on the other hand the analysis of these images presents significant limitations in describing the fog vertical structure bendix et al 2005 cermark 2007 as for the surface observations method i e meteorological stations this is more suitable for measuring local meteorological variables allowing accurate site specific characterizations of fog with high temporal resolution yet this method reveals its limitations when it comes to characterizing the vertical fog structure for extended areas for example a large number of weather stations fog collectors and cloud radars are needed for a regional scale fog study schween et al 2020 leading to increased economic costs airborne observations are so far the best alternative for measuring the vertical structure of scf clouds although they present severe limitations in terms of temporal resolution given that the vertical distribution of the scf is very dynamic thus losing accuracy in describing diurnal cycles moreover the frequently used radiosoundings are typically launched from airports or flatlands thus providing results that do not consider the influence of topography within this paper we propose a new method called ground optical fog observation system gofos for measuring frequency and vertical components of the scf while addressing some of the issues listed above the results derived from the testing of this method have been validated through standard methods and observations thanks to this analysis we could observe how the gofos combines the synchronous high temporal resolution of surface observations with vertical observations taking advantage of the local topography through this study we aim to answer the following question how does the gofos perform characterizing the scf frequency and its vertical structure the article is structured as follows in section 2 the gofos instrumentation and operation are described together with the relative data processing within section 3 the results regarding scf frequency and vertical distribution are shown within section 4 the gofos performance is analyzed by comparing its results with the ones obtained through standard methods finally in section 5 the main conclusions of this study are presented together with gofos potential future applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 gofos instrumentation and installation the ground optical fog observation system gofos was installed in the coastal cordillera of the atacama desert at 15 to 20 km from the coastline and between 600 and 1350 m above the sea level asl where advective fog can be found fig 1 a and b the gofos is composed of two optical time lapse cameras configured to acquire an image every 10 min and a series of solar powered lights that automatically activate in the dark the cameras brinno protlc are installed on a plastic tripod and connected to a 10 w solar panel for getting continuous power supply fig 1c the light system is installed on a 1 5 m galvanized iron pole and it consists of 44 leds configured in a red mode supplied by a 6 w solar panel fig 1d the cameras are strategically placed in two sites at 1350 m asl 20 580429 s 70 029714 w and at 600 m asl 20 627451 s 70 058907 w the choice of these specific locations permits the observation of both the top and the base of the stratocumulus clouds fig 1b covering the 750 m height range that corresponds to the area of stratocumulus fog scf presence cereceda et al 2008b these cameras oversee a transect of pole lights located every 50 m along the slope from 600 to 1350 m asl the top camera frames from e to w i e towards the pacific ocean nine pole lights located between 850 m and 1250 m asl the bottom camera frames from w to e a profile of pole lights installed between 650 m and 900 m asl the observation of the well defined fog day cycle with higher frequencies during the afternoon night and dawn cereceda et al 2008a is performed through different methods during night and day times a night image showing lights indicates the absence of fog contrarily assuming that lights can be covered by the fog itself the same night image without lights shown indicates the presence of fog as for day images by taking into account the exact location and height of the pole lights in the slope it is possible to visually determine the presence or absence of scf as well as the level height of the cloud top ct and cloud base cb moreover if the cameras capture images composed of fog only i e foggy blank images scf presence is recorded at the correspondent location and height in summary the cameras observations indicate the stratocumulus fog cloud presence the ct and cb heights and the cloud depth cd the top camera captured images from august 2016 to january 2018 whereas the bottom one captured images from january 2017 to january 2018 2 2 data processing initially a subset of 5080 pictures acquired by gofos cameras was manually processed to obtain a database of ct cb and cd measures more specifically the 5080 pictures were labeled by a supervisor who determined the presence or absence of fog for each sample additionally pictures were manually classified as either night or day images for the night ones a binary classification was done by visual inspection of the pole light elevation corresponding to each picture according to this classification the value 1 corresponding to non visible light indicates fog presence fig 2 b and d and the value 0 corresponding to visible light indicates fog absence fig 2a and c the previous data subset was used to run a deep learning model based on a convolutional neural network an algorithm that had already been successful used in several weather image interpretation processes liu et al 2016 shi et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 the model was run using the python programming language python software foundation https www python org and an architecture based on the one proposed by shi et al 2016 the neural network received as input specific cropped regions of pictures where the pole lights were located returning as output the correspondent probability of fog presence according to these outputs if the probability was lower than 25 no fog was detected if the probability was higher than 75 the fog was detected if the probability was between 25 and 75 the software let the user supervisor determine the presence or absence of fog after running the fully automated classification process the following quality statistics have been obtained accuracy correct

configured so that the user could manually classify the images fig 2e and f improving the algorithm s performance to avoid false negatives detections then the binary results were automatically systematized into a database the remaining pictures nearly 32 000 were automatically classified by the model whereas for daylight pictures the entire binary classification was performed manually finally diurnal and nocturnal datasets were unified the presence of fog was confirmed if at least one of the observations diurnal and nocturnal corresponded to the binary value 1 this method was used to calculate the scf frequency for a determined time period an hour a day or a month for example 50 of an hour of fog presence corresponds to 3 observations taken every 10 min reporting the value 1 50 of a day of fog presence corresponds to 72 observations reporting the value 1 and 50 of a month of fog presence corresponds to 2160 measurements with value 1 the heights of ct and cb were estimated through the highest and lowest synchronic fog observations respectively finally the cd was calculated based on the corresponding cb and ct values 2 3 supporting data for gofos validation to validate our observations and critically analyze gofos performance we compared its results with datasets listed and summarized in table 1 obtained by surface airborne and satellite observations in this way we analyzed gofos detections in terms of scf frequency ct and cb 2 3 1 scf frequency as for the fog frequency gofos results were compared with different data derived from surface observations and satellite images table 1 for the comparison with surface observations results we used values of air temperature relative humidity and air pressure recorded by two weather stations the first of these ones is located at 50 m asl at iquique airport 20 54917 s 70 16944 w and 15 km from the gofos it is administrated by the meteorological direction of chile dmc and it has been recording 10 minutes resolution data since 1981 fig 1b the second fully equipped weather station operating with the same time resolution was installed in november 2016 at 1 220 m asl 20 491615 s 70 058724 w and 10 km from the gofos firstly we follow the methodology suggested by lobos et al 2018 which defines marine boundary layer regimes related to fog formation or dissipation these regimes are based on a threshold derived from thermal and moisture gradients over a vertical section of the mbl the reference thresholds for fog formation are 0 0031 k m 1 and 0 0016 g kg 1 m 1 thus we calculated the two marine boundary layer mbl fog regimes well mixed fog formation or stratified fog dissipation these results have been modified according to the thresholds derived by gofos observations using this information we compared our results for scf presence with the ones obtained from well mixed and stratified fog regimes these regimes are calculated by estimating the potential temperature θ and specific humidity q from both weather stations over a vertical gradient from 50 m to 1220 m asl subsequently we calculated the θ and q values per vertical meter thanks to this data we could classify the abl fog formation presence regime well mixed and fog dissipation absence regime stratified according to 1 θ z δ θ δ z 3 65 10 3 k m 1 w e l l m i x e d 3 65 10 3 k m 1 s t r a t i f i e d 2 q z δ q δ z 1 88 10 3 g kg 1 m 1 w e l l m i x e d 1 88 10 3 g kg 1 m 1 s t r a t i f i e d secondly we used another surface observations dataset to validate our results for scf frequency the oktas one from iquique airport this dataset is the result of a systematic visual observation performed by an operator of the airport every hour for the whole year 2017 these datasets belong to the dmc to estimate the scf frequency we detected fog presence if oktas values were 7 being 8 8 the maximum cloud cover value in combination with a low cloud condition cb altitude 1500 m asl recorded by the oktas operator finally we compared the scf frequency obtained by the gofos with results derived from geostationary operational environmental satellite goes images we calculated the scf frequency reported by the goes in february and september 2017 respectively the lowest and highest fog season month in the coastal atacama desert cereceda et al 2008a for each of these two months five images per day captured at 00 39 04 39 07 39 12 39 and 19 39 local time lt were processed to represent the fog diurnal cycle farias et al 2005 as for the nocturnal cycle the scf detection was obtained through a widely used method based on the difference between short 3 8 µm and long 10 9 µm thermal infrared wavelengths eyre 1984 ellrod 1995 lee et al 1997 anthis and cracknell 1999 bendix 2002 underwood et al 2004 del río et al 2018 this method classifies as low clouds the pixels presenting both low bright 2 µm and high temperature 273 k jedlovec and laws 2003 torregrosa et al 2015 on the other hand the diurnal scf identification was based on change detection techniques contrasting each image with 100 cloud free ones 2 3 2 cloud base to analyze gofos measurements of the cb height we compared these with two other surface observation data sources table 1 the first dataset is obtained by a ceilometer located within iquique airport this instrument administrated by the dmc recorded cb values every hour from august to december 2017 the second dataset came from standard meteorological observations taken by the airport weather station located at 50 m asl based on such observations we applied the methodology suggested by wetzel and boone 1995 and already utilized by lobos et al 2018 for calculating the lift condensation level lcl on the coast of the atacama desert doing so we assume the lcl to be the base of the scf cloud lobos et al 2018 2 3 3 cloud top to validate the ct heights estimated by the gofos we compared these with the radiosoundings dataset belonging to dmc of cerro moreno airport antofagasta 23 45361 s 70 44056 w these radiosoundings measurements are taken daily at 12 00 utc 08 00 local time 330 km southern than the gofos ones fig 1a the analysis of this dataset for the whole 2017 revealed a thermal inversion layer height lower than or equal to 1400 m asl 3 results and discussions the advective fog in the atacama desert is characterized by scf frequency and vertical variability the complex terrain in which this phenomenon takes place represents a significant variable whose effects are difficult to observe and quantify within this context the gofos enables us to describe in situ scf variations in the following section gofos observations regarding scf frequency cloud top ct cloud base cb and cloud depth cd are reported 3 1 scf frequency according to the gofos gofos observations reveal remarkable seasonal and diurnal scf frequency cycles the seasonal cycle presents its minimum and its maximum during the austral summer and winter respectively fig 3 a fig 3a shows that the lowest scf frequencies occur during summer specifically in january 2 presence and february 1 5 presence the scf frequency starts to escalate fast at the end of autumn increasing more than double in a month the highest frequency values occur during winter in july 49 presence and august 50 presence during the southern spring from september to december this frequency constantly decreases until the beginning of summer it is interesting to observe how even though during spring the fog frequency is not the highest together with winter these two seasons correspond to a long fog period covering the second half of the year fig 3b shows scf diurnal cycle monthly means for representative months february for summer may for autumn august for winter and november for spring within these months the same diurnal cycles yet characterized by different magnitudes are observed during the diurnal cycle the highest scf frequency occurs during the night 00 00 06 00 lt the early morning 06 00 09 00 lt and the evening 19 00 00 00 lt conversely the lowest frequency occurs during the late morning and the afternoon 10 00 18 00 lt all the reported months except may present a fog frequency pick between 20 00 and 22 00 lt during may the pick occurs at dawn 06 00 09 00 lt during february and august a total absence of fog is reported from the morning to the afternoon slightly higher frequency values ranging from 3 to 5 are recorded at mid day 11 00 13 00 lt in may and in november the vertical distribution of the gofos along the coastal cordillera enables us to quantify the vertical variability of scf frequency revealing where fog regularly occurs fig 4 shows the annual scf frequency vertical variability observed through the gofos along the altitudinal pole lights transect for 2017 we notice that the scf frequency starts increasing at 600 m asl and reaches its highest value at 1000 m asl at 1000 m asl the frequency of scf starts to decline gradually until 1300 m asl at 1000 m asl the total annual frequency of scf is 30 consistently with the values represented in fig 3 we also noticed that locations below 700 m asl and above 1300 m asl present lower scf presence near 10 at 950 m asl the increment of scf frequency presents a discontinuity that might be due to a technical limitation of the gofos bottom system the absence of a light pole at this height if so a scf frequency between 20 and 25 would be expected at this point 3 2 vertical fog distribution gofos observations describe the seasonal diurnal cycles of vertical advective fog distribution fig 5 a shows the weekly average seasonal variability of cd measured from the ct to the cb these results reveal that the largest cd occurs during summer 315 m thick when the ct and cb are at their highest point fig 5a for example january february and march present average cds of 325 300 and 275 m respectively this gradual thinning of the cd is mainly due to the decreasing ct height while the cb one is steady during autumn cd values decrease reaching approximately 230 m due to both ct and cb height drops the cd decrease continues during winter cd 220 m together with the decline of ct and cb values during this season the cd reaches its minimum in august 170 m finally we notice that the spring average cd 230 m is slightly higher than the winter one fig 5b shows the average cd diurnal cycle during january in the graph we find some gaps indicating the absence of scf fig 3a and b also it is possible to observe that the scf is thicker in the afternoon i e 15 00 lt than in the morning while in june the development of the cd diurnal cycle is continuous over the day fig 5c this is due to the rapid scf rise occurring between 13 00 and 14 00 lt followed by a progressive decrease until midnight 20 00 24 00 lt finally during november fig 5d a continuous scf increase can be observed with the highest cd 400 m reached during the afternoon 14 00 18 00 lt fig 6 a shows the inverse relationship between ct diurnal cycle and fog frequency the lower higher the ct height the higher lower the scf frequency it is relevant to note that the highest recorded ct values is 1000 m of height consistently with the data showed in fig 4 as for the annual negative correlation between ct and scf frequency fig 6a the r2 of 0 40 p 0 005 increases until 0 60 p 0 005 if summer months are excluded from the analysis fig 6a also shows that the highest scf frequencies correspond to the lowest ct heights between 900 and 1100 m asl and that these frequencies increase mainly during the night when the ct is shallower conversely the lowest scf presence occurs between noon and the afternoon consistently with its diurnal cycle presented in fig 3b on the other hand fig 6b shows a low correspondence between the cb height and the scf frequency this means that these two variables are mainly independent of each other nevertheless as for the scf diurnal cycle we can observe that the cb one has a similar trend to the ct one fig 6a and b where the highest lowest frequency of scf presence occurs during the night and the morning noon afternoon fig 6c shows a positive correlation between the ct and cb height values the highest correspondence between these two variables occurs during the night and at dawn when scf regularly forms with ct at 1000 m of height and cb at 850 m of height the annual correlation between ct and cb values is characterized by an r2 of 0 44 p 0 005 while the monthly analysis report that 75 of the analyzed months present an r2 of 0 77 p 0 005 revealing a strong correlation between these variables 4 gofos and the standard stratocumulus and fog observations methods within this section we compare gofos observations of stratocumulus fog scf frequency cloud base cb and cloud top ct with the ones obtained through the standard methods introduced in section 2 3 and listed in table 1 4 1 scf frequency observed by the gofos and standard methods 4 1 1 the atmospheric boundary layer regimes we compared gofos observations of the scf frequency with the estimations of fog formation presence and dissipation absence classified through the marine boundary layer mbl regimes method by lobos et al 2018 section 2 3 eqs 1 and 2 for performing this comparison we only analyzed fog presence events whose ct is at least at 1220 m asl because the mbl regimes method requires the presence of weather stations below the ct for correct fog classification the scf presence observed through the gofos 467 total hours in 2017 87 corresponds with an mbl under moisture q well mixed regime whereas the correspondence decreases to 79 considering an mbl regime under thermal well mixed conditions we hypothesize that the higher agreement between gofos scf frequency observations and the q well mixed regime is due to the direct relationship existing between q and the fog the high consistency between gofos results and both θ and q well mixed regimes indicates that scf has a high possibility 80 to form when q and θ within the mbl are lower than 1 88 g kg 1 and 3 65 k respectively yet we observe seasonal and diurnal variabilities of these results fig 7 shows the distribution of the analyzed cases of both scf frequency and mbl regimes for january june and november representative months for summer winter and spring respectively on one hand analyzing january data fig 7a we notice that 12 out of the 14 cases present a correspondence between θ well mixed regimes and scf frequency reaching an 85 agreement between these two datasets on the other hand the results reveal a 50 consistency between the q well mixed regime and scf frequency as for june fig 7b the agreement between θ well mixed regime and scf frequency decreases to 64 whereas a 77 consistency with q well mixed regimes is found finally in november fig 7c both well mixed regimes reach their highest agreement with gofos scf frequency observations 95 for the q well mixed regime and 85 for the θ well mixed regime as for the diurnal variabilities of well mixed regimes and gofos observations table 2 shows their average agreement for january june and november in general high correspondence is found during the evening night transition where gofos results are more consistent with q well mixed regimes than with the θ well mixed ones data related to january 2017 show less scf presence together with a significant correspondence between the mbl regimes method and gofos observations in june the mbl regimes method reports higher daily scf presence and lower agreement with gofos observations finally in november the mbl regimes technique shows the highest scf presence and the best correspondence with gofos dataset these results are consistent with the ones obtained by lobos et al 2018 over the same study area during 2015 4 1 2 satellite dataset and oktas observations the scf presence measured by the gofos was compared with the ones recorded through goes satellite datasets and oktas observations from iquique airport the processed goes images define scf frequency within the study area over the gofos and oktas working ranges which correspond to one goes cell size pixel of 1 4 km as for the oktas dataset we considered observations reporting a cloud cover 7 to correspond to scf presence we performed two different kinds of comparisons between february and september monthly averages of the scf frequency to estimate these averages we analyzed five images per day taken by the goes at 0 39 04 39 07 39 12 39 19 39 local time gofos measurements taken every 10 min and oktas hourly observations firstly we correlated the results obtained by goes with the ones derived by the gofos secondly we compared oktas and goes monthly means for each of the five goes images for the corresponding 5 moments of the day table 3 shows monthly scf frequency means estimated by goes for the two study fields over the gofos installation and in the iquique airport area during september goes results show slightly less scf frequency than gofos and oktas measurements reaching a 93 agreement with these two even though gofos and oktas monthly mean estimations are based on significantly more data the analysis of satellite images at selected hours represents an effective method for describing the monthly scf frequency as for the monthly average diurnal cycles the highest difference between goes and gofos results occurs at sunset nevertheless the observations taken during the rest of the day show a high agreement among these two datasets reaching a 100 correspondence at noon also comparing results obtained by goes and the oktas we find high agreement among these two at night nearly 100 agreement but such correspondence decreases at noon and sunset the comparison between gofos and oktas results shows that the oktas detected a higher scf frequency both as monthly and daily averages except for the measurements taken at sunset the higher scf frequency shown by the oktas may be due to the location from which the two measurements were taken since iquique airport is located on the coastal plain 3 km from the coastline where oceanic conditions dominate and the land heat influence is lower on the other hand the gofos is located over the coastal cordillera 15 20 km onshore where the topography and the land heating significatively influence the dissipation of the fog lobos et al 2018 the scf diurnal cycles defined by oktas and gofos observations reveal the described geographic influence showing similar percentages of scf frequency at night and dawn such results are associated with scf inland advection events farías et al 2005 conversely the biggest difference between observations obtained through these two methods occurs at noon when solar radiation dissipates the scf as for february 2017 the comparison between gofos oktas and goes results should be interpreted cautiously due to a low scf frequency within the study area yet scf presence monthly means show a strong agreement between goes and gofos results since both datasets report a 1 5 of scf frequency for this month as for the comparison between goes and oktas results the scf frequency reported by goes is about 50 lower than the one obtained by the oktas measurements table 3 as for scf frequency monthly hourly means goes shows a similar level of agreement with both gofos and oktas values since observations obtained through these last two techniques present identical scf frequencies at night and different ones at dawn noon and sunset gofos and oktas measurements provide a site specific estimation of scf presence the precision of the results obtained through these techniques would be difficult to equal through satellite data sources yet satellite datasets allow us to monitor and understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of the scf phenomenon 4 2 cloud base observed through the gofos and surface observations within this section we compare cb values obtained by the gofos with the ones obtained through two other techniques the ceilometer and the lift condensation level lcl method firstly we compare our cb results with measurements taken by a ceilometer in the airport of iquique secondly we use meteorological data provided by iquique airport to estimate the lcl wetzel and boone 1995 assuming it to correspond to the base of stratocumulus clouds section 2 3 fig 8 shows boxplots of the cb height monthly means derived by both gofos and ceilometer results from august to december 2017 we found an expected positive correlation between both datasets r 0 6 95 confidence level yet this analysis shows how the cb height indicated by the gofos is on average 80 m higher than the one measured by the ceilometer such a difference might be due to topographic reasons since the mountain barrier present in the study area forces the scf to rise cereceda et al 2008b as for the comparison between the cb values estimated through the lcl method cblcl and the ones described by the gofos cbgofos we generally observe lower cblcl these results are shown in fig 9 together with a comparison between ct measurements obtained by the gofos and by the antofagasta airport radiosounding this comparison is analyzed in the next section moreover table 4 summarizes the descriptive statistics related to the comparison shown in fig 9 the mean cb values observed by the gofos differ only by 7 from the cb values estimated through the lcl methods being the cbgofos higher than the cblcl table 4 this difference is due to the influence that topography exerts over the cb rising its value fig 1b also both these methods report similar standard deviations 76 m for gofos results and 80 m for the ones obtained through the lcl method comparing the cb extreme values derived from the two datasets we observe that the maximum cb height detected through both methods almost coincide while minimum values differ by 9 from each other finally analyzing the interquartile area 25 50 and 75 we observe large differences of 100 m probably caused by the seasonal scf variability affecting both methods 4 3 cloud top observed by the gofos and radiosounding finally we compared ct observations derived from the gofos ctgofos with the ones obtained by the antofagasta airport radiosoundings ctrs this comparison is shown in fig 9 and summarized in table 4 where it is possible to observe that the ctgofos mean is 80 m higher than the ctrs one to analyze this mismatch three factors are taken into account firstly we have to carefully take into consideration the different latitudes of the two observation points the gofos one is approximately 330 km further n than the antofagasta airport and the annual displacement of the se pacific anticyclone which causes an increase of the ct height from s to n garreaud et al 2008 however we believe that no significant differences are generated by the latitudinal variation since both locations present similar synoptic and geographical conditions secondly rs are launched from the coastal plain while gofos measurements are taken from the coastal cordillera where local topography influences the ct height thirdly the difference between observation times plays a significant role in determining the contrast between ctgofo and ctrs values since ctgofos results are based on observations taken for all hours of fog events whereas ctrs values are based on 08 00 lt measurements only when the boundary layer is likely to be shallow it is possible to conclude that higher ctgofos values are justified by the influence of topography moreover comparing ct mean heights obtained through these two methods we notice about an 8 difference among their results the standard deviation of both methods is also similar analyzing their extreme values it emerges that the respective cts differ of maximum 100 m and minimum 30 m between gofos and rs results finally the trends shown within the interquartile area are consistent with these observations 60 100 m 5 conclusions in this paper we present the gofos as a new method for describing fog frequency and vertical distribution combining the advantages of high temporal resolution of surface observations with the ones given by the peculiar geography of the coastal atacama desert this technique characterizes the vertical elevation range of the stratocumulus cloud providing direct observations of the advective fog presence the height of the cloud base cb and the one of the cloud top ct such information allows us for the first time to characterize in situ the vertical distribution of the scf phenomenon a high agreement was found between gofos fog frequency results and the ones measured through standard methods reaching 93 correspondence between gofos and goes datasets likewise there is a consistency between gofos observations and the ones obtained through the marine boundary layer mbl regimes method for studying fog formation and dissipation this agreement reaches 87 when comparing observations made by the gofos with specific humidity well mixed regimes on the other hand gofos results are 79 consistent with potential temperature well mixed regimes this two ways validation may be further explored to improve the mbl regimes method for obtaining a better classification of the scf formation or dissipation the gofos is also presented as a reliable method for determining vertical scf cloud variability by setting the highest fog frequency at 1000 m asl this frequency is consistent with the highest ct and the thinnest cd means during the fog season june november as for the cb this maintains a steady state along the annual cycle on the other hand cb is significantly variable within its diurnal cycle where the highest scf frequency occurs during the night and morning and the lowest scf frequency occurs during the noon and afternoon in agreement with the highest ct s observations gofos observations of scf vertical distribution demonstrated to be consistent with results obtained by more commonly used methods finally the gofos can well describe the influence of topography on scf dynamics nevertheless this method presents some uncertainties firstly only the clouds located within gofos installation range can be analyzed this limited coverage reduces the capacity of observation of the method secondly a better description of the scf vertical variability would be obtained through a higher resolution than the one provided by the gofos 50 m vertical resolution thirdly the gofos location which significantly influences its results through topography and slope orientation might be considered as an exceptional one finally long term measurements 5 years would allow validating gofos results based on longer time series of data this would allow analyzing gofos performance in representing larger scale phenomena e g the enso phases moreover given the distance between the camera and the pole lights there might be a lag in the measurement despite these uncertainties the gofos was revealed to be a simple reliable and affordable technique thus this method represents a good alternative for the systematic and automatic monitoring of fog presence and its vertical distribution moreover the gofos can be adapted and improved for different topographic conditions potentials and projections related to this new method are described below the gofos allows us to better understand the relationship between scf vertical structure and frequency these data are useful to qualify potential areas for fog harvesting the gofos provides the possibility to relate scf vertical distribution to spatial changes in fog dependent ecosystems this knowledge significantly contributes to the study of the relationship between atmosphere and biosphere for better understanding past and future climatic changes the gofos contributes to the validation of other methodologies such as the mbl regimes method for classifying fog formation and dissipation two key variables for fog forecasting the gofos contributes to the validation of satellite datasets adding ground truth to the scf identification and characterization process local scale datasets provided by the gofos and the weather stations significantly contribute to our understanding of the physics of cloud formation these results could be improved by adding to the gofos installation more sensors measuring additional atmospheric variables such as temperature relative humidity wind speed and air pressure through this upgrade the gofos could better characterize the thermodynamics of the scf vertical profile providing fundamental knowledge for the understanding of fog presence and its physical characteristics such as its liquid water content credit authorship contribution statement camilo del río felipe

4617,the uplift of the tibetan plateau tp not only may enhance physical denudation and chemical weathering but also makes this area contain the largest glacier storage outside the polar regions there is an argument on whether glaciation favours chemical weathering and carbon sequestration to explore chemical weathering processes and intensities in the cold glacial region of the central tp hydrochemistry of the river water in two catchments i e the qugaqiong and qugaqie was monitored from april to september 2018 with high frequency sampling these two catchments share similar geographical features except there are some cold glaciers in the upper reaches of the qugaqie the results of chemical composition show that the river water of the qugaqie has a lower proportion of ca2 and hco3 but higher so4 2 and k na compared with the qugaqiong the seasonal variation of ionic concentration in the qugaqie is significant but minor in the qugaqiong those differences highlight the glacial impact in the qugaqie compared with the non glacierized qugaqiong solutes in the glacial runoff of the qugaqie mainly derive from sulfide oxidation its contribution to cations in the runoff of the zhadang glacier and the hanging glacier reaches 39 and 36 the second most important contribution is carbonate dissolution 32 for both glacial runoffs silicate weathering provides fewer solutes and its contribution is only 20 and 11 in the two glacial runoffs respectively river water of the qugaqiong shares similar hydrochemical characteristics with the non glacial tributaries draining granodiorite biotite adamellite in the qugaqie the contribution of sulfide oxidation to solutes in those rivers decreases to 10 while carbonate dissolution increases to 50 glacial comminution exposed trace sulfide minerals thus made sulfide oxidation became pretty active due to this reaction is much faster than other mineral dissolution the carbonate weathering rate cwr and silicate weathering rate swr in the qugaqie catchment are 9 7 t km2 y and 6 7 t km2 y in comparison values in the qugaqiong catchment are 6 9 t km2 y and 3 8 t km2 y respectively which means cwr and swr is 1 4 and 1 8 times higher in the qugaqie catchment respectively higher runoff and physical erosion rates are considered as the main reasons for higher chemical denudation rates in the qugaqie catchment the drainage system of the glaciers is dominated by the distributed pattern which caused longer residences time of water thus further promoted chemical weathering in the glacierized region our observation supports the idea that glaciation in the glacierized catchment of the central tp enhances chemical weathering especially for swr chemical denudation rates in the qugaqie catchment remain at a moderate level compared with other glacierized catchments in the world and lithology and runoff are important factors to cause this spatial heterogeneity keywords glaciation central tibetan plateau chemical weathering silicate carbonate 1 introduction the glacier is an important geographical feature on the earth s surface in high latitude and high altitude cold climate environments there are about 215 543 glaciers and ice caps outside the greenland and antarctic ice sheets with a total area of 705 253 km2 farinotti et al 2019 in general chemical denudation rates are low in glacierized areas due to low temperatures thin soil and lack of vegetation anderson 2005 anderson and dietrich 2001 berner 1998 drever and zobrist 1992 white and blum 1995 however glaciation generates important differences between glacial and non glacial physical and chemical processes anderson et al 1997 high flushing rates large quantities of freshly ground chemically reactive rock flour and high suspended load concentrations in the glacierized catchment favour chemical weathering sharp et al 1995 anderson 2007 this leads to the question that do glaciers enhance or inhibit chemical weathering rates relative to other environments the importance of glaciers in the global carbon cycle and climate change hinges on this answer anderson et al 1997 some studies conclude that chemical weathering of temperate glaciated catchments yields solute fluxes above the global mean rate anderson et al 1997 sharp et al 1995 their observation has led to the speculation that glaciation can cause significant atmospheric co2 drawdown and thus provide negative feedback on climate sharp et al 1995 tranter 1996 however some researchers have argued that solutes in glacial runoff primarily derive from sulfide oxidation and carbonate dissolution while silicate weathering which could lead to carbon sequestration in the geological time scale is restrained anderson et al 1997 deuerling et al 2019 hindshaw et al 2016 hosein et al 2004 glaciation may increase chemical weathering rates but there is much controversy about this and findings from one glaciated area are not easily extrapolated to other areas making it difficult to apply them to long term carbon cycle models goudie and viles 2012 the lack of sufficient field observation data about chemical weathering in glacierized areas is the main reason for the controversy the tibetan plateau tp is a hotspot area in the research of chemical weathering this region has attracted numerous scientists attention due to the famous hypothesis global cooling in the cenozoic have been caused by the uplift of the tp through enhancing silicate weathering raymo and ruddiman 1992 the strong uplift makes the tp become the world s largest and highest cenozoic plateau yao et al 2015 the high elevation of the tp not only may enhance physical denudation and chemical weathering but also makes this area and surrounding mountains contain the largest number of glaciers outside the polar regions with a total glacial area of 100 000 km2 yao et al 2012 however chemical weathering research conducted in glacierized areas of the tp is limited hodson et al 2002 west et al 2002 wu 2018 kumar et al 2019 li et al 2019 shukla et al 2019 singh et al 2019 furthermore the areas studied in previous research are located on the margins of the plateau and most are temperate glaciers studies of chemical weathering in cold glaciers on the central or inland regions of the tp are still sparse due to the harsh sampling conditions even though these types of glaciers are widespread there as a consequence it is still an open question that what s the influence of cold glaciers on chemical denudation of rocks in this study we present data about the chemical weathering processes and intensities of two catchments the qugaqiong and qugaqie on the western nyaingêntanglha mountains central tp these two catchments contain similar lithology climate and other geographical characteristics but differ in glaciation cold glaciers are present in the upper reaches of the qugaqie whereas in the qugaqiong glaciers are nonexistent the purpose of this study is to gain insight into the influences of glaciation on the processes and intensities of chemical weathering on the central tp 2 study site the qugaqiong and qugaqie catchment are located at the northern slope of the western nyaingêntanglha mountains central tp a and b in fig 1 the drainage area of the qugaqiong and qugaqie is 24 km2 and 59 km2 with a mean elevation of 5174 4733 5786 m and 5391 4733 6093 m respectively the study areas have a semiarid subarctic plateau climate gao et al 2011 according to records from the nagenna mountain meteorological station b in fig 1 the total precipitation and mean air temperature during the period october 2017 to september 2018 were 464 mm and 0 98 c respectively precipitation from june to september 2018 was 424 mm accounting for more than 90 of the annual rainfall the mean air temperature in this period was about 7 8 c therefore the study areas have relatively warm and wet weather in the monsoon season may to october but are cold and arid during the non monsoon period november to april the two catchments share similar lithology with biotite adamellites and granodiorites distributed in the southern part while the middle and northern of the catchments are covered by sandstone slate and quaternary sediments all rocks in the study areas are silicate and only trace carbonate minerals are found kapp et al 2005 investigated geochemical characteristics of the nyaingêntanglh mountain and they found the content of cao and mgo in most samples of its crystalline complex are less than 2 0 and 0 5 respectively in addition the qugaqiong and qugaqie share similar geographical environments in climate soil and vegetation due to their neighbouring proximity however about 5 km2 land upstream of the qugaqie is covered by cold glaciers i e the zhadang glacier genpu glacier and hanging glacier accounting for 9 of the entire drainage area yu et al 2019 glacial meltwater is the main source of the qugaqie river water accounting for 50 of the total runoff in 2006 2008 gao et al 2015 a large glacial deficit in summer resulted in negative annual mass balances of 1200 mm during 2005 2012 qu et al 2014 the qugaqiong is mainly recharged by groundwater and there is no glacial runoff in this catchment thus both catchments show many similarities in geographical settings except for the condition of glaciation this provides an ideal backdrop to explore the impact of glaciation on chemical weathering of the central tp 3 methodology the sampling campaign for the qugaqiong and qugaqie had been carried out between april and september 2018 two monitoring sections downstream of the qugaqiong and qugaqie i e s2 and s1 c in fig 1 were chosen to obtain high resolution seasonal variation about runoff hydrochemistry and suspended particulate matter spm in addition stream water samples from tributaries of the qugaqie which have different recharge forms and bedrocks were collected to shed light on chemical weathering processes in these areas the sampling and monitoring methods are similar to previous research which was also conducted in this area yu et al 2019 and so we only describe it briefly here automatic water stage recorders onset hobo u20 were placed in the monitoring sections during the monitoring period with a resolution of 0 0014 m and accuracy of 0 1 synchronous runoff of the two rivers was obtained through the area velocity method proposed by us department of the interior 1997 in the middle of each month the cross sectional area was measured at an interval of 1 m using a steel dip sticks with a resolution of 0 01 m the water velocity was also measured at an interval of 1 m in the vertical at 0 6 of the depth below the surface using a propeller current meter jiangsu nanshui water technology ls1206b 1 5 for accuracy according to the research of rantz et al 1982 then synchronous runoff can be calculated by the cross sectional areas multiply water velocities rating curves were developed based on the relationship of synchronous discharge and continuously recorded water stages consequently the high temporal resolution of runoff during the monitoring period could be calculated using the rating curves a similar method has been applied by kumar et al 2019 in a himalayan glacierized basin and errors in runoff measurement are believed to 5 10 therefore the errors in the runoff determination of this study are estimated at less than 10 water temperature wt ph value and specific conductivity at 25 c of the stream water were measured in situ using a portable multi parameter meter hanna hi98129 with resolutions of 0 1 c 0 01 and 1 μs cm respectively the concentration of hco3 in river water was obtained in the field using the alkamerck alkalinity test merck with a resolution of 0 1 mmol l river water at s1 and s2 was sampled weekly using 1 l acid washed hdpe bottles nalgene stream water from tributaries of the qugaqie was collected in late may early june august and late september early october of 2016 2018 the rainwater at the nam co station for multisphere observation and research namor fig 1 was collected during the monitoring period in addition surface snow ice was sampled on the zhadang glacier genpu glacier and hanging glaciers with clean plastic bags 1242 ml nasco whirl pak the concentration of hco3 in rainfall and snow ice is calculated by ionic charge balance riverine sediments were also sampled using clean plastic bags 532 ml nasco whirl pak as a consequence 37 river water samples in the monitoring sections of the qugaqie and qugaqiong 23 glacial runoff samples 21 stream water samples in the non glacial tributary of the qugaqie 28 rainfall samples at the namor and 36 snow ice samples were collected all the samples were transported to the namor within two hours and stored in a refrigerator 18 c the samples were then transported to the key laboratory of tibetan environment changes and land surface processes lhasa branch chinese academy of sciences as soon as possible frozen treatment may result in calcite precipitation due to the enrichment effect in the freezing process however quick freeze and low tds of river water limited this precipitation and makes this process may only exert minor and negligible influences on the hydrochemistry of this study spm concentrations of river water were obtained by filtering a known weight of water samples through pre weighted lcr ptfe membrane filters diameter 47 mm pore size 0 45 μm millipore filtered water was used for the measurement of cations and anions riverine sediments were digested using hydrofluoric and nitric acid in a teflon beaker after leaching using acetic acid cations for all samples were measured using icp oes teledyne prodigy and anions were tested using ic dionex ics900 the sensitivity of cationic and anionic measurement is 0 001 mg l and 0 01 mg l with an accuracy of 2 and 5 respectively saturation of calcite dolomite and gypsum are calculated from hydrochemical data water temperature ph and concentrations of k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 using the modified program watspec wigley 1997 4 results molar ratio of ca na in riverine sediments of the qugaqiong qugaqie and zhadang glacierized catchment is 0 23 0 28 and 0 27 and the molar ratio of mg k is 0 19 0 11 and 0 14 respectively similar elemental ratios of riverine sediments further demonstrate that the lithology is similar in these catchments 4 1 runoff runoff of the qugaqiong during the period may to october 2018 was 0 15 108 m3 i e 625 mm in runoff depth and shows pronounced seasonal variation the peak occurs in july and was slightly lower in august total runoff in july and august accounts for over 60 to water flux during this monsoon season the minimum occurs in october which is only 13 of the runoff in july the seasonal variation of runoff is consistent with the change of precipitation recorded by the meteorological station the automatic water stage recorder in s1 was unfortunately lost hence we calculated the runoff in the qugaqie during the monitoring period based on the instantaneous water discharge data measured in the middle month of may to september 2018 the runoff of the qugaqie during the period may to september 2018 was 0 67 108 m3 and also shows remarked seasonal change the maximum and minimum value occurred in august and may 2018 respectively and the latter was only 12 of the former runoff in october 2016 only accounts for 6 of the total runoff in the monsoon season of this years yu et al 2019 additionally this parameter during the non monsoon period is only 5 of the total runoff for one hydrological year yu et al 2019 hence the absence of water flux data in october and the non monsoon season of 2018 did not cause significant uncertainty regarding the runoff calculation for the qugaqie the runoff of the qugaqie from may to september 2017 was calculated based on instantaneous water discharge data on the 15th of every month in this period the value is 0 46 108 m3 which is only 4 less than the result obtained by high resolution monitoring yu et al 2019 therefore this method does not cause a significant deviation from the actual situation in the study areas runoff of the qugaqie counted using instantaneous water discharge data in the middle of the month is an alternative method to obtain water discharge when a high resolution hydrological measurement is not available 4 2 physico chemical parameters water temperatures of the qugaqiong and qugaqie during the monitoring period range from 2 7 c to 14 0 c and 0 4 c to 12 1 c with mean values of 8 1 c and 7 4 c respectively seasonal variation of the former does not show any trend but the latter is consistent with the change of air temperature with higher values in august and lower values in late april the ph values of the qugaqiong and qugaqie range from 7 78 to 8 94 and 7 72 to 8 73 respectively the mean value of ph in both rivers is 8 23 and shows lower value in the mid monsoon season but higher in the beginning and end of this period the stream water of the qugaqie tributaries is also mildly alkaline and mean values range from 7 21 to 7 91 which is even lower than the mean value of river water from s1 during the monitoring period this illogical phenomenon is caused by the difference in sampling dates most stream water samples from the tributaries are collected in the mid monsoon season a large proportion of meltwater from snow ice and rainwater was flushed into the river making the ph values low due to ph values in the precipitation being relatively low li et al 2007 spm in river water of the qugaqiong and qugaqie varies from 0 13 mg l to 147 15 mg l and 10 26 mg l to 212 01 mg l with mean values of 11 64 mg l and 62 65 mg l respectively this demonstrates a 5 times higher spm concentration in the qugaqie river than in the qugaqiong river total dissolved solids tds k na ca2 mg2 sio2 cl no3 so4 2 hco3 in mg l is a parameter reflecting ionic concentration in water tds of the qugaqiong and qugaqie during the monitoring period ranges from 20 21 mg l to 43 98 mg l and 21 95 mg l to 71 00 mg l with mean values of 34 38 mg l and 33 02 mg l respectively mean tds values of the tributaries in the qugaqie vary from 17 01 mg l to 36 01 mg l 26 mg l on average this parameter in most tributaries of the qugaqie is lower than the mean value from s1 which is also caused by the difference in sampling dates aforementioned the major ionic elemental composition in river water of the qugaqiong and qugaqie is shown in table 1 cationic elemental concentration in these two rivers follows an order of ca2 na sio2 mg2 k and anionic concentration is hco3 so4 2 no3 cl as depicted in fig 2 ca2 is the dominant cation for all samples with proportions of over 50 of total cations the proportion of ca2 in river water of the qugaqiong and qugaqie ranges from 64 to 71 and 52 to 68 with mean values of 68 and 64 respectively the mean proportion of k na in the qugaqiong and qugaqie accounts for 18 14 23 and 24 18 38 of total cations whereas the mean proportion of mg2 in these two rivers is the lowest i e 14 13 17 in the qugaqiong and 12 10 14 in the qugaqie hco3 is the dominant anion and accounts for over 60 for most samples the mean proportion of hco3 to total anions in the qugaqiong and qugaqie reaches 79 70 86 and 70 59 77 respectively so4 2 is the second most important anion accounting for 19 and 28 on average in those two rivers respectively proportions of cl are minor with a mean value of 2 in both rivers glacial runoff shows a tiny difference in cationic composition from stream water of the non glacial tributaries nevertheless glacial runoff has lower hco3 but higher so4 2 in anionic composition ca2 and hco3 is the most important cation and anion respectively in all samples indicating the dissolution of carbonate may be a crucial geochemical process controlling hydrochemistry in the study areas however the qugaqiong river water has a higher proportion of ca2 and hco3 but lower so4 2 and k na compared with the qugaqie which means that the contribution of carbonate dissolution may be more important to solutes in the qugaqiong river water whereas sulfide oxidation and silicate weathering are more intense in the qugaqie catchment the mean value of total cationic charges tz of the qugaqiong and qugaqie during the monitoring period is 446 9 ranging from 292 0 to 598 6 μeq and 442 9 295 5 887 6 μeq respectively the mean value of total anionic charges tz in the stream water of the qugaqiong and qugaqie tributaries is 439 4 247 3 574 1 μeq and 421 1 276 9 906 1 μeq respectively the normalised inorganic charge balances nicb z z z 100 of the qugaqiong and qugaqie range from 8 to 15 and 7 to 17 with mean values of 7 and 2 respectively the nicb values in most samples are within 10 demonstrating most ions in river water of this study have been accurately measured the nicb values in runoff of the zhadang glacier and genpu glacier are higher but their mean values are also no more than 10 10 and 6 respectively the mean values of nicb in gw4 and gw5 are 0 and 3 respectively whereas this parameter in gw1 3 is 17 26 and 12 which may be caused by underestimation of hco3 in field measurement due to its low concentration all saturation indexes of calcite dolomite and gypsum are below 0 in river water of both the qugaqiong and qugaqie with mean values of 1 2 3 3 3 7 and 1 4 3 7 3 6 respectively this information indicates calcite dolomite and gypsum could still be dissolved by the river water and the possibility of precipitation of these minerals is low high spm concentration may influence ionic concentration through the exchange of divalent ions from solution for monovalent ions on surface exchange namely ca2 and mg2 is exchanged for na and k tranter 2003 high concentrations of spm in the qugaqie occurred in june 2018 with a mean value of 101 mg l while the minimum is five times lower in september 2018 19 mg l therefore more k and na should be released into the river water by the cationic exchange in june 2018 due to higher spm concentrations however the fact that the concentration of monovalent ions is 1 3 times higher in september 2018 invalidates this assumption thus the influence of ionic exchange with spm on ionic concentration is weak the chemical weathering processes and intensities in the study areas can be well constrained using the ionic concentration we obtained 5 discussion 5 1 sources of riverine solutes the atmospheric input needs to be excluded before distinguishing solutes originating from chemical weathering of rocks atmospheric input for the qugaqiong which is mainly recharged by groundwater is calculated using a rainwater correction method proposed by grosbois et al 2000 1 x x x cl rain cl ref x refers to ionic concentration in river water x denotes the corrected ionic concentration derived from precipitation x cl rain represents the molar ratio of ions and cl in rainwater clref is calculated by the evapotranspiration factor f multiplied by the weighted mean cl concentration of the rainwater furthermore f is obtained from the total amount of precipitation in mm y divided by the total runoff depth in mm y in this catchment all the cations in this equation are in μmol l rainwater samples were not collected in the qugaqie catchment nor in the qugaqiong catchment due to the logistic problem hence we take the rainwater samples collected at the namor as the rainfall endmember this may overestimate the contribution of atmospheric input to some extent due to ionic concentration may be lower in regions with higher elevation li et al 2007 lower concentration of cl in river water of the qugaqiong and non glacial runoffs of the qugaqie than the precipitation table 1 can ascribe to this reason however a significant difference in the concentration of other ions especially for cations between precipitation and river water makes this overestimation negligible the total runoff in the qugaqiong catchment was about 625 mm in 2018 which is even higher than the amount of monitored precipitation at the namor during this period this unexpected phenomenon can be explained by heavier precipitation in the alpine regions according to the records of the meteorological station in upstream of the qugaqie 5400 m above sea level near the sampling site of gw1 in fig 1 precipitation from june 2016 to may 2017 was about 760 mm while the precipitation at the namor during the same period was only 489 mm gao et al 2015 also found the precipitation in the zhadang glacier catchment was 27 higher than in the whole qugaqie catchment in 2007 and 2008 therefore we applied the f value 1 22 obtained in the niyaqu catchment 60 km away from the study area to exclude the input of precipitation at s2 yu et al 2019 this method is also applied for the non glacial runoffs of the qugaqie the precipitation correction at s1 was deciphered using the method proposed by yu et al 2019 the atmospheric input in the glacial runoffs is excluded using the mean ionic concentration of snow ice of the zhadang glaciers and the result is shown in fig 4 molar ratios of elements after the precipitation correction are good indicators of the sources of riverine solutes from chemical weathering gaillardet et al 1999 the molar ratio of ca2 na versus hco3 na and ca2 na versus mg2 na in river water of the qugaqiong qugaqie and its tributaries are shown in fig 3 denotes ions have been excluded from atmospheric input all samples fall between the endmembers of carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering which means chemical weathering of these two kinds of rock is the dominant factor controlling the hydrochemistry of the river water however significant spatial heterogeneity is also depicted in fig 3 most glacial runoffs are closer to the carbonate dissolution endmember than other river water the non glacial tributaries of the qugaqie are located in the middle of the endmembers between carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering some stream water at the monitoring section of the qugaqie s1 is unexpectedly closer to the silicate weathering endmember relative to other samples this phenomenon is caused by the difference in the sampling date of those samples as mentioned above the samples at s1 close to the silicate weathering endmember were collected at the very beginning of the monsoon season when the river is mainly recharged by groundwater and its residence time is relatively long than that of the mid monsoon season which favours silicate weathering hindshaw et al 2011 maher 2010 the glacial runoffs as a comparison are primarily recharged by meltwater with a high flush rate and short residence time this runoff regime favours the dissolution of carbonate minerals but suppresses silicate weathering anderson et al 1997 thus carbonate dissolution becomes more active than silicate weathering in the glacial environments even though the content of carbonate minerals is minor while silicate is abundant in bedrocks beneath the glaciers river water of the qugaqiong remains at the middle of the endmembers of carbonate and silicate dissolution and overlaps with most non glacial tributaries of the qugaqie indicating both the contributions from carbonate and silicate weathering are important for their riverine solutes molar ratios of ca2 na versus mg2 na in the river water even indicate some fraction of the solutes originates from evaporite dissolution however the absence of gypsum and halite layers in the study areas denied this assumption therefore we attribute all cl to atmospheric input and all so4 2 to sulfide oxidation after the correction from atmospheric input feng et al 2017 also attribute sulfate in the river of yamdrok co basin south of the nam co basin to pyrite weathering based on isotopic fingerprints the possibility that mg2 and na derive from the dissolution of sodium sulfate or other evaporites is also low due to the absence of these kinds of deposits mg2 and na in the study regions are believed to derive from carbonate and or silicate weathering ultimately we assumed riverine solutes in the study areas originate from atmospheric input sulfide oxidation chemical weathering of silicate and carbonate the forward model galy and france lanord 1999 was applied to quantify the contributions to riverine solutes of the qugaqiong and qugaqie furthermore the differences in chemical weathering processes caused by the difference in glaciation in the two catchments can be accurately evaluated the contribution of the sources to major cations in stream water of tributaries of the qugaqie is shown in fig 4 the mean contribution of atmospheric input silicate weathering carbonate dissolution and sulfide oxidation to the cations of the zhadang glacial runoff is 9 20 32 and 39 respectively sulfide oxidation is crucial in governing the hydrochemistry of this area and its value even reaches 50 at the end of the monsoon season the dissolution of carbonate is the second most important source while the contribution from silicate weathering seems less important the influence of atmospheric input on solutes in this runoff is also minute but slightly higher during the glacial ablation period with a peak of 14 in august sulfide oxidation is also the dominant source of riverine solutes in the hanging glacial runoff with a mean value of 36 carbonate dissolution is the second most important source accounting for 32 solutes originating from silicate weathering and atmospheric input are minor with mean contributions of 11 and 20 respectively carbonate dissolution becomes the dominant process controlling the evolution of solutes in the genpu glacial runoff with a mean value of 38 while the contribution of sulfide oxidation is slightly lower 32 the mean proportion of silicate weathering and atmospheric input is 16 and 19 respectively the lower proportion of sulfide oxidation in the genpu glacial runoff relative to that of the zhadang and hanging glacial runoff may be caused by the difference in the location of the sampling sites due to the difficulty in accessing the genpu glacier the sampling site for this runoff is much further away from the glacier snout c in fig 1 groundwater is an important source for the genpu glacier runoff on its sampling site because some creeks mainly recharged by groundwater flow into while this kind of influence on the zhadang glacial runoff and hanging glacial runoff is negligible obviously sulfide oxidation is active in catchments occupied by cold glaciers and hydrochemistry of the runoff in glacierized areas of this study is primarily controlled by this process this phenomenon is also revealed in other research conducted in temperate glaciers anderson et al 1997 2000 hindshaw et al 2016 shukla et al 2019 solutes in the non glacial tributaries have similar provenances except for gw5 the contribution of sulfide oxidation decreases markedly in gw1 4 compared with that of the glacial runoff with a mean value of 10 carbonate dissolution on the contrary becomes the most important source accounting for about 55 this distinct difference is caused by the absence of glaciation in gw1 4 even though they share similar lithology with the glacial areas the mean contribution of silicate is 20 which is close to the values in the runoff of the zhadang glacier and genpu glacier the mean value of atmospheric input is about 15 with a decreasing trend from upstream to downstream we speculate this spatial difference is caused by higher precipitation in upstream areas as discussed previously glacial comminution exposed trace sulfide minerals thus made sulfide oxidation became pretty active due to this reaction is much faster than other mineral dissolution besides glacier cover increases the probability of high ph weathering solutions by excluding the co2 from the atmosphere at the weathering site gíslason et al 1996 therefore carbonate dissolution is inhibited by high ph in the glacial runoff the lower contribution of carbonate weathering to solutes in the glacial runoff than that of the non glacial tributaries draining similar lithology is attributed to this mechanism as for riverine solutes in gw5 the mean contributions of sulfide oxidation and carbonate dissolution are close and both are about 35 solutes from silicate weathering and atmospheric input are 18 and 12 respectively a higher proportion of sulfide oxidation than in other non glacial tributaries may be caused by a higher content of sulfide minerals in bedrocks of the gw5 sandstone and slate sandstone is known to contain pyrite that dissolves oxidatively to produce sulfuric acid jin et al 2014 hindshaw et al 2016 also found sulfate comprised 72 86 of the summer anion budget and that sulfide oxidation is an important source of riverine solutes in a high arctic unglaciated catchment dominated by sandstone and shale in lithology solute sources for river water sampled in the monitoring sections s1 and s2 were also quantified by the forward model and the results are depicted in fig 5 as the monsoon season progresses the contribution of sulfide oxidation to cations of river water of the qugaqie increases from 20 at the beginning of the season to 35 at the end of the monsoon season 2018 the mean proportion of sulfide oxidation to cations in the qugaqie is 24 the proportion of atmospheric input is minor in the beginning and end of the monsoon season 6 but reaches 18 in the middle of this season this seasonal variation coincides with the glacial ablation period the mean contribution of atmospheric input during the monitoring period is about 14 contributions of carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering are quite close for the whole qugaqie catchment both are about 31 but show different seasonal variation patterns silicate weathering is higher in the early monitoring period with a percentage of 54 but decreases markedly in the middle period about 26 the contribution of carbonate dissolution shows a contrary tendency with a higher percentage in the middle period 34 than that of the beginning 25 and end of the monitoring period 27 the pronounced seasonal variation for these sources in the qugaqie catchment is caused by the seasonal change in recharge forms in the beginning and end of the monsoon season river water is mainly recharged by groundwater while the contribution from meltwater of the glacier is minor due to the low temperature hence silicate weathering is the dominant geochemical process controlling hydrochemistry due to the main recharge form being groundwater and its long residence time favours silicate weathering however the contribution of glacial meltwater can reach 81 from june to july gao et al 2015 becoming the most important source of river water in the mid monsoon season because of the intense ablation of the glaciers therefore the contributions of sulfide oxidation and carbonate dissolution are higher at s1 during the mid monsoon season because most water comes from glacial runoff which has high proportions of sulfide oxidation and carbonate dissolution in solutes the disparities of mean contributions of sources to riverine solutes are minor in terms of values calculated from late april to late september 2018 and the values obtained in a hydrological year yu et al 2019 in the qugaqie catchment both the atmospheric input and sulfide oxidation are 4 higher but silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution are 4 lower in this study the differences may be caused by the absence of monitoring during the non monsoon season in this study the mean contribution of atmospheric input sulfide oxidation silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution to riverine solutes of the qugaqiong during the monitoring period is 13 17 22 and 48 respectively those are completely different from the contributions at s1 but similar to the non glacial tributaries which drain granodiorite biotite or adamellite highlighting that chemical weathering processes are similar in catchments sharing similar bedrocks and recharge forms it is worth noting that the contribution of atmospheric input in the qugaqiong is lower than that of the qugaqie the higher contribution of atmospheric input in the qugaqie is caused by the extra recharge of meltwater from the glaciers in addition to rainfall inputs in contrast to the qugaqie the percentage of sources of riverine solutes in the qugaqiong only show minute seasonal variation this phenomenon is also found in the niyaqu catchment eastern nam co which is mainly recharged by groundwater too yu et al 2019 the minor seasonal variation may be caused by the difference in groundwater residence time in the monsoon season of 2018 the seasonal change of the proportion of atmospheric input in the qugaqiong is even consistent with the seasonal variation of runoff and precipitation this coincidence illustrated the accuracy of the model we used to quantify sources of riverine solutes and that the results we obtained are robust 5 2 chemical weathering rates chemical weathering rates in the qugaqiong catchment are calculated using solute flux collected in a high frequency sampling campaign multiplied by daily runoff on the sampling date whereas chemical weathering rates in the qugaqie catchment are obtained using solute flux multiplied by runoff in the middle of every month of the monitoring period due to lack of high resolution hydrological data uncertainty regarding the calculation of chemical weathering rates in the study areas resulting from this method is mainly produced from the following aspects 1 the calculation of annual runoff the error in the runoff measurement is estimated as 10 as discussed above 2 the determination of cationic concentration the accuracy of cationic measurements is 2 then 2 uncertainty will be caused when we calculated cationic flux by these 5 cations k na ca2 mg2 and sio2 the total error caused in the calculation of chemical weathering rates can be evaluated by the error propagation equation of σ w r σ q 2 σ c 2 where σwr denotes error in the calculation of chemical weathering rates σq and σc represents the error in runoff measurement and ionic concentration test respectively namely the uncertainty of chemical weathering rates calculation in the study regions is 10 the absence of monitoring work during october and non monsoon season in the qugaqie may produce underestimation to some extent however this underestimation is minor according to the previous research conducted in this catchment even though this uncertainty is difficult to be quantified yu et al 2019 the runoff during october and non monsoon season 2017 accounted for 11 of the annual runoff according to previous research yu et al 2019 this value may be applicable to the neighbouring qugaqiong because they share similar geographical characteristics besides runoff of the qugaqie calculated by instantaneous water discharge data in the middle of every month may result in an underestimation of 4 compared to that by high resolution monitoring according to the data obtained in monsoon season 2017 yu et al 2019 in addition the absence of monitoring work during october and non monsoon season 2018 may also produce some underestimation in cationic concentration ca2 mg2 car and k na ca2 mg2 sil of the qugaqie river water is 17 and 30 lower in the monitoring work from may to september 2017 than the annual values respectively yu et al 2019 however the condition that only 11 runoff occurred in this period makes the errors in ionic concentration calculation reduced to 2 and 3 for carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering respectively carbonate weathering rate cwr in the qugaqiong catchment is relatively high from june to august 2018 with a mean value of 19 6 t km2 y the maximum occurs in june 2018 21 6 t km2 y and is caused by the comparably high concentration of ca2 mg2 and hco3 which mainly originates from carbonate dissolution silicate weathering rate swr increases as the monsoon season progresses and the maximum occurs in september 2018 12 0 t km2 y the high value in september is caused by high concentrations of cations elements i e k na and sio2 which originate from silicate weathering additionally the runoff of the qugaqiong is still high this month the minimum cwr and swr values occur in may 2018 and this phenomenon is attributed to the lowest runoff being in this period the maximum cwr and swr in the qugaqie catchment occur in august 2018 with mean values of 41 5 t km2 y and 27 4 t km2 y respectively the minimum of both cwr and swr in this catchment also occur in may 2018 with mean values of 5 3 t km2 y and 6 1 t km2 y respectively seasonal variation of chemical weathering rates is in accordance with the temporal change of runoff indicating the seasonal change of chemical denudation intensities in the qugaqie catchment is controlled by runoff this assumption has also been revealed in previous research yu et al 2019 we compared the correlations between the cwr and swr with runoff wt and physical erosion rates per in the qugaqiong catchment to explore the governing factor for seasonal variation of chemical weathering rates in this region the results are shown in fig 7 both the cwr and swr in the qugaqiong show a significant positive correlation with runoff but a low correlation with wt the correlation between the cwr and per is lower than the correlation between the swr and per this indicates runoff is the most important factor in controlling the seasonal variation of chemical weathering rates the influence of temperature on seasonal variation of chemical denudation rates seems to be covered by other factors even though the cwr increases roughly with rising temperatures the relationship between the cwr and swr with per shows a logarithmic function with a threshold value of 4 t km2 y the swr increases rapidly when per less than 4 t km2 y but the increment becomes insignificant when per is over this threshold the relationship between swr with per in the qugaqie also shows a similar pattern but its threshold is 100 t km2 y yu et al 2019 the notable difference in threshold is caused by glaciation in the qugaqie catchment large quantities of rock flour caused by comminution at the bottom of the glaciers can be flushed into the river water of the qugaqie whereas most rock detritus is filtrated by soil or sediments in the qugaqiong catchment even though numerous particles are formed due to strong physical erosion processes such as frost shattering hall et al 2002 the higher elevation and slope in the qugaqie catchment are also beneficial to the transportation of particles the cwr and swr of the qugaqiong and qugaqie in a hydrological year are calculated from the data obtained during the monitoring period and we assume there is no chemical exhumation in the other months of 2018 the absence of monitoring in the non monsoon period would not cause a significant deviation from the actual situation for the reasons discussed before the cwr and swr in the qugaqie catchment during 2018 are 9 7 t km2 y and 6 7 t km2 y respectively these values are 7 and 10 higher than the corresponding values from october 2016 to september 2017 9 1 t km2 y and 6 1 t km2 y respectively yu et al 2019 higher values in 2018 are caused by higher runoff in this period annual runoff in 2018 and from october 2016 to september 2017 was about 0 67 108m3 and 0 48 108m3 respectively which means runoff in 2018 was 40 higher than that in the period from october 2016 to september 2017 such an interannual variation is not unexpected because the runoff from may to september 2018 is very close to the value from may to october 2016 0 69 108m3 the cwr and swr in the qugaqiong are 6 9 t km2 y and 3 8 t km2 y respectively the cwr and swr in the qugaqie is 1 4 and 1 8 times higher than that in the qugaqiong catchment indicating glaciation in the qugaqie increased chemical weathering rate of both carbonate and silicate chemical weathering processes are similar in catchments of the qugaqiong and the non glacial tributaries of the qugaqie chemical denudation intensities may also be comparable due to similarities in lithology recharge form and other geographical characteristics hence the difference in chemical weathering rates between the qugaqiong and qugaqie catchments is mainly caused by the glacierized regions as mentioned above carbonate dissolution is the second most important source of solutes in the glacial runoff about 33 while this contribution to riverine solutes in the qugaqiong and non glacial tributaries of the qugaqie reaches 48 higher runoff in the glacierized regions results in higher cwr than the groundwater recharge areas even though the contribution of carbonate dissolution is relatively low in glacial runoff there this hypothesis can be supported by the fact that runoff of the qugaqie during the monitoring period is 1 8 times higher than the corresponding value of the qugaqiong 1155 mm and 625 mm respectively as for the swr the contribution of silicate weathering to riverine solutes in the glacial zones and non glacial areas of the qugaqie is similar both are about 19 and the proportion of this source to solutes in the qugaqiong is 22 moreover the quantity of tds in these rivers is close table 1 therefore more runoff in the glacial zones would enhance silicate weathering runoff of the qugaqie is 1 8 times higher than that of the qugaqiong while the swr in the former catchment is also 1 8 times higher this coincidence further demonstrates the governing impact of runoff on silicate weathering the mean per values in the qugaqie and qugaqiong catchments are 195 9 t km2 y and 26 9 t km2 y respectively as analysed previously the correlations between per with the cwr and swr are significant in the qugaqiong catchment per is also an important environmental factor governing chemical weathering rates in the qugaqie catchment yu et al 2019 fresh rock flour caused by subglacial abrasion and grinding along with disruption of mineral lattices and high surface area make glacial sediments exceptionally weatherable anderson et al 1997 in addition the mineral surface area increases with glacial runoffs anderson 2005 those factors make the proportions of solutes originated from silicate weathering in the glacial regions are comparable with that in the non glacial catchments thus the 7 3 times higher per in the qugaqie provided abundant materials for chemical weathering and is also responsible for higher swr in this region anderson 2005 analysed the relationship between per and silica flux in glacial catchments and concluded the production of new reactive mineral surface area by glacial erosion drives silicate weathering fluxes it is worth noting that the correlation between runoff and per is significant in both catchments i e per increase sharply with the increment of runoff and their relationship can be well constrained by an exponential equation thus runoff may exert a profound influence on per in the study areas the high runoff period often accompanied by high per due to the transportation of particles can be greatly enhanced at that time therefore the relationships between runoff per and chemical denudation rates are highly coupled and inter related despite the predominance of carbonate weathering and sulfide oxidation in most glacial systems silicate mineral weathering could also be enhanced under certain hydrological conditions such as within long residence time distributed subglacial drainage system hindshaw et al 2011 tranter et al 2002 urra et al 2019 the chilly climate in the glacierized region of the qugaqie makes the distributed flowpaths becomes the predominant way there is only one moulin on the smooth surface of the zhadang glacier during the ablation period that demonstrated this assumption fig 8 this situation may be also prevalent in other cold glaciers drainage systems in the qugaqie catchment due to they share a similar geographical environment ca si ratio in glacial runoff could shed light on the geochemical processes that occurred in the subglacial system hindshaw et al 2011 the elevated ca si ratio is thought to be caused by enhanced calcite dissolution while the low ca si ratio indicates silicate weathering is more intensity secondary calcite precipitation or re dissolvement may change this elemental ratio dramatically however the low saturation index of calcite and dolomite abbreviate as sic and sid respectively in the glacial runoff of the qugaqie catchment denied this hypothesis the values of sic and sid of the zhadang glacial runoff ranged from 2 65 to 0 81 and 6 11 to 2 30 with an average of 1 85 and 4 52 respectively all these values below than 0 throughout the monitoring period indicate that this glacial runoff is far from equilibration and calcite and dolomite can still be dissolved for instance sic and sid for samples collected at 10 00 october 6 2017 is only 1 89 and 4 72 respectively even though riverine solutes concentration is relatively high in this period this situation may also prevail in other glacierized regions of the qugaqie catchment due to they share similar lithology and other environmental settings hence we believe the possibility of calcite precipitation in glacierized regions of the qugaqie catchment is low and its influence on the evolvement of ca2 si is minor as depicted in fig 8 the ca si ratio of the qugaqie is low with values close to 1 5 before the indian monsoon arrived denotes after the atmospheric input correction this parameter increased slightly at the beginning of the monsoon season but the increment becomes sharply with the monsoon season progresses and formed a peak from june 15 to july 4 2018 when snow melting is intense ca si ratio decreased significantly and became relatively stable after july 4 2018 with an average of 2 0 obviously hydrochemistry of the qugaqie river water is characterized by a low ca si ratio in most periods indicating the glacial drainage system was dominated by the distributed pattern waters of the delayed flow are relatively concentrated because they flow through the distributed system where they are in contact with large quantities of relatively reactive recently comminuted rock flour and importantly because there is a renewable supply of protons available to sustain prolonged chemical weathering tranter et al 1993 slow transit of water and relatively long residence time in the distributed drainage system makes rock water interaction stronger which promotes silicate mineral weathering due to its relatively low rates of dissolution this mechanism has been revealed by tranter et al 2002 and they think the longer residence times of water in the distributed drainage system allow silicate weathering to occur kumar et al 2019 also proved the prevailing of a distributed subglacial drainage system in the chhota shigri glacial catchment generates more solutes during the positive annual mass balances period especially for ions originated from silicate weathering the peak of ca si ratio from june 15 to july 4 2018 infers drainage system during this period may be dominated by a channelized pattern when snow cover thaws out and moulin becomes an effective channel to the migration of meltwater to the glacier bed the accumulated water caused by the ablation of snow and ice may break through the barriers under the glacier which may be the reason for the formation of a channelized drainage system in a cold glacier the channelized drainage system allows carbonate dissolution to become more important compared with that in a distributed system due to the short residence time of water in the former the higher proportion of carbonate dissolution to total cations of the qugaqie from june 15 to july 4 2018 and the maximum occurred on june 15 39 consisting with the seasonal variation of ca si ratio illustrated this assumption however more observations are needed to clarify the seasonal evolvement of the drainage system in the subglacial drainage system of qugaqie catchment 5 3 comparison with other glacierized areas in order to understand the chemical weathering intensity of the qugaqie which is partly occupied by cold glaciers we compiled the chemical denudation rates and environmental features of this catchment i e bedrocks drainage area runoff depth and glacier coverage with other glacial areas unfortunately studies on chemical weathering rates in glacierized catchments are still scarce and some of them do not describe the cwr and swr therefore we have only compiled the total cationic denudation rates tcdr to represent chemical weathering intensity in the study areas of the referenced work the results are shown in table 2 the tcdr of the qugaqie catchment is moderate when compared with other glacierized areas we compiled chemical weathering rates of the qugaqie are close to these catchments which have similar bedrocks i e igneous rocks diorite and gneiss axtmann and stallard 1995 hasnain et al 1989 sharp et al 1995 wu 2018 however the value in the qugaqie is much lower than catchments with rocks which are susceptible to dissolution such as evaporite carbonate and basalt but higher than catchments with weathering resistant rocks crystalline rock sandstone and granite church 1974 gíslason et al 1996 hasnain and thayyen 1996 hodson et al 2002 hodgkins et al 1997 león and pedrozo 2015 singh et al 2019 wu 2018 obviously lithology is crucial to tcdr in glacierized areas for instance tcdr in tunuyán glacial catchment dominated by evaporite could reach 128 0 t km2 y even though runoff depth is only 320 mm león and pedrozo 2015 however some catchments dominated by granite or gneiss have a distinct difference in tcdr gneiss is the most widespread bedrock in both chhota shigri and barnes while tcdr in the former is nearly eight times higher church 1974 hasnain et al 1989 therefore other environmental factors may also influence the spatial distribution of the tcdr to some extent as depicted in fig 9 tcdr increases with the increment of runoff and shows a significant positive correlation p 0 05 runoff reflecting the amount of meltwater in a glacierized catchment benefits chemical weathering because water is a necessary and crucial factor in this process moreover water can facilitate glacier movement on bedrocks by acting as a sliding agent resulting in plenty of weatherable materials been produced by intense crushing and grinding of subglacial bedrock and sediments of glaciers the significant positive correlation between the tcdr and runoff demonstrated those hypotheses the correlations between tcdr with drainage area and glacial coverage are insignificant p 0 05 indicating the influence of those factors on tcdr is minor from the perspective of glacierized catchments compiled in this study lithology in these catchments with large drainage areas is often complex and contain more easily weathered stratum or minerals which may be the reason for the higher tcdr in catchments with a broad area such as the batura glacierized catchment hodson et al 2002 however some large catchments are also dominated by a single lithology for instance the rocks in the barnes glacierized area are dominated by granite and gneiss church 1974 even though the drainage area of this catchment can reach 205 km2 weathering resistant rocks meybeck 1987 couple with low runoff caused the extremely low tcdr in this catchment hence the correlation between drainage area and tcdr is weak even though they roughly increase in parallel not all rocks in such high glacial coverage catchments are weatherable or weathering resistant in addition glacial coverage does not show a significant correlation with runoff fig 9 therefore the influence of glacial coverage on chemical weathering rates is insignificant and its impact may be overwhelmed by the influence of lithology and runoff the low correlations between tcdr with the drainage area and glacial coverage however may also be an artifact of limited data in addition the dataset of tcdr we compiled from other literature is obtained by different sampling strategy and most of them based on short observation periods which may partly responsible for the low correlations therefore more reliable chemical weathering rates obtained by high frequency sampling and long monitoring periods need to be accumulated in the future works to better explore the processes and controlling factors of chemical weathering in glacierized catchments of the world 6 conclusions the qugaqiong and qugaqie located on the central tp share similar geographical characteristics except for several cold glaciers located upstream in the qugaqie catchment this study investigates whether cold glaciers influence processes and intensities of chemical weathering on the tp the analysis of glacial runoff shows that sulfide oxidation is the most dominant source of riverine solutes and followed by carbonate dissolution the qugaqiong and non glacial tributaries of the qugaqie draining granodiorite biotite adamellite share similar hydrochemistry the evolution of riverine solutes in those catchments is governed by carbonate dissolution and the contribution from sulfide oxidation is much lower than that of the glacierized areas the cwr in catchments of the qugaqie and qugaqiong is 9 7 t km2 y and 6 9 t km2 y this similarity can be explained by lower runoff depth coupled with higher contribution of carbonate dissolution to solutes in the qugaqiong and higher runoff depth combined with lower contribution of carbonate dissolution in glacierized areas of the qugaqie the swr in the qugaqie and qugaqiong is 6 7 t km2 y and 3 8 t km2 y respectively the 1 4 times higher cwr and 1 8 times higher swr in the qugaqie catchment is attributed to the 1 8 times higher runoff depth and 7 3 times higher per in this glacierized catchment the drainage system of the glacier is dominated by the distributed pattern which caused longer residences time of water thus further promoted chemical weathering in the glacierized region our results emphasize that glaciation enhances chemical weathering on the central tp tcdr in the qugaqie catchment remains at a moderate level compared with other glacierized catchments in the world lithology and runoff are crucial to the spatial heterogeneity of chemical denudation rates in these catchments however more data with high quality dealing with chemical weathering rates in the glacial environment are still needed in future works to better understand the chemical weathering and its controlling factors in glacierized regions of the world especially on the tp where glacier is ubiquitous credit authorship contribution statement zhengliang yu conceptualization investigation

4617,the uplift of the tibetan plateau tp not only may enhance physical denudation and chemical weathering but also makes this area contain the largest glacier storage outside the polar regions there is an argument on whether glaciation favours chemical weathering and carbon sequestration to explore chemical weathering processes and intensities in the cold glacial region of the central tp hydrochemistry of the river water in two catchments i e the qugaqiong and qugaqie was monitored from april to september 2018 with high frequency sampling these two catchments share similar geographical features except there are some cold glaciers in the upper reaches of the qugaqie the results of chemical composition show that the river water of the qugaqie has a lower proportion of ca2 and hco3 but higher so4 2 and k na compared with the qugaqiong the seasonal variation of ionic concentration in the qugaqie is significant but minor in the qugaqiong those differences highlight the glacial impact in the qugaqie compared with the non glacierized qugaqiong solutes in the glacial runoff of the qugaqie mainly derive from sulfide oxidation its contribution to cations in the runoff of the zhadang glacier and the hanging glacier reaches 39 and 36 the second most important contribution is carbonate dissolution 32 for both glacial runoffs silicate weathering provides fewer solutes and its contribution is only 20 and 11 in the two glacial runoffs respectively river water of the qugaqiong shares similar hydrochemical characteristics with the non glacial tributaries draining granodiorite biotite adamellite in the qugaqie the contribution of sulfide oxidation to solutes in those rivers decreases to 10 while carbonate dissolution increases to 50 glacial comminution exposed trace sulfide minerals thus made sulfide oxidation became pretty active due to this reaction is much faster than other mineral dissolution the carbonate weathering rate cwr and silicate weathering rate swr in the qugaqie catchment are 9 7 t km2 y and 6 7 t km2 y in comparison values in the qugaqiong catchment are 6 9 t km2 y and 3 8 t km2 y respectively which means cwr and swr is 1 4 and 1 8 times higher in the qugaqie catchment respectively higher runoff and physical erosion rates are considered as the main reasons for higher chemical denudation rates in the qugaqie catchment the drainage system of the glaciers is dominated by the distributed pattern which caused longer residences time of water thus further promoted chemical weathering in the glacierized region our observation supports the idea that glaciation in the glacierized catchment of the central tp enhances chemical weathering especially for swr chemical denudation rates in the qugaqie catchment remain at a moderate level compared with other glacierized catchments in the world and lithology and runoff are important factors to cause this spatial heterogeneity keywords glaciation central tibetan plateau chemical weathering silicate carbonate 1 introduction the glacier is an important geographical feature on the earth s surface in high latitude and high altitude cold climate environments there are about 215 543 glaciers and ice caps outside the greenland and antarctic ice sheets with a total area of 705 253 km2 farinotti et al 2019 in general chemical denudation rates are low in glacierized areas due to low temperatures thin soil and lack of vegetation anderson 2005 anderson and dietrich 2001 berner 1998 drever and zobrist 1992 white and blum 1995 however glaciation generates important differences between glacial and non glacial physical and chemical processes anderson et al 1997 high flushing rates large quantities of freshly ground chemically reactive rock flour and high suspended load concentrations in the glacierized catchment favour chemical weathering sharp et al 1995 anderson 2007 this leads to the question that do glaciers enhance or inhibit chemical weathering rates relative to other environments the importance of glaciers in the global carbon cycle and climate change hinges on this answer anderson et al 1997 some studies conclude that chemical weathering of temperate glaciated catchments yields solute fluxes above the global mean rate anderson et al 1997 sharp et al 1995 their observation has led to the speculation that glaciation can cause significant atmospheric co2 drawdown and thus provide negative feedback on climate sharp et al 1995 tranter 1996 however some researchers have argued that solutes in glacial runoff primarily derive from sulfide oxidation and carbonate dissolution while silicate weathering which could lead to carbon sequestration in the geological time scale is restrained anderson et al 1997 deuerling et al 2019 hindshaw et al 2016 hosein et al 2004 glaciation may increase chemical weathering rates but there is much controversy about this and findings from one glaciated area are not easily extrapolated to other areas making it difficult to apply them to long term carbon cycle models goudie and viles 2012 the lack of sufficient field observation data about chemical weathering in glacierized areas is the main reason for the controversy the tibetan plateau tp is a hotspot area in the research of chemical weathering this region has attracted numerous scientists attention due to the famous hypothesis global cooling in the cenozoic have been caused by the uplift of the tp through enhancing silicate weathering raymo and ruddiman 1992 the strong uplift makes the tp become the world s largest and highest cenozoic plateau yao et al 2015 the high elevation of the tp not only may enhance physical denudation and chemical weathering but also makes this area and surrounding mountains contain the largest number of glaciers outside the polar regions with a total glacial area of 100 000 km2 yao et al 2012 however chemical weathering research conducted in glacierized areas of the tp is limited hodson et al 2002 west et al 2002 wu 2018 kumar et al 2019 li et al 2019 shukla et al 2019 singh et al 2019 furthermore the areas studied in previous research are located on the margins of the plateau and most are temperate glaciers studies of chemical weathering in cold glaciers on the central or inland regions of the tp are still sparse due to the harsh sampling conditions even though these types of glaciers are widespread there as a consequence it is still an open question that what s the influence of cold glaciers on chemical denudation of rocks in this study we present data about the chemical weathering processes and intensities of two catchments the qugaqiong and qugaqie on the western nyaingêntanglha mountains central tp these two catchments contain similar lithology climate and other geographical characteristics but differ in glaciation cold glaciers are present in the upper reaches of the qugaqie whereas in the qugaqiong glaciers are nonexistent the purpose of this study is to gain insight into the influences of glaciation on the processes and intensities of chemical weathering on the central tp 2 study site the qugaqiong and qugaqie catchment are located at the northern slope of the western nyaingêntanglha mountains central tp a and b in fig 1 the drainage area of the qugaqiong and qugaqie is 24 km2 and 59 km2 with a mean elevation of 5174 4733 5786 m and 5391 4733 6093 m respectively the study areas have a semiarid subarctic plateau climate gao et al 2011 according to records from the nagenna mountain meteorological station b in fig 1 the total precipitation and mean air temperature during the period october 2017 to september 2018 were 464 mm and 0 98 c respectively precipitation from june to september 2018 was 424 mm accounting for more than 90 of the annual rainfall the mean air temperature in this period was about 7 8 c therefore the study areas have relatively warm and wet weather in the monsoon season may to october but are cold and arid during the non monsoon period november to april the two catchments share similar lithology with biotite adamellites and granodiorites distributed in the southern part while the middle and northern of the catchments are covered by sandstone slate and quaternary sediments all rocks in the study areas are silicate and only trace carbonate minerals are found kapp et al 2005 investigated geochemical characteristics of the nyaingêntanglh mountain and they found the content of cao and mgo in most samples of its crystalline complex are less than 2 0 and 0 5 respectively in addition the qugaqiong and qugaqie share similar geographical environments in climate soil and vegetation due to their neighbouring proximity however about 5 km2 land upstream of the qugaqie is covered by cold glaciers i e the zhadang glacier genpu glacier and hanging glacier accounting for 9 of the entire drainage area yu et al 2019 glacial meltwater is the main source of the qugaqie river water accounting for 50 of the total runoff in 2006 2008 gao et al 2015 a large glacial deficit in summer resulted in negative annual mass balances of 1200 mm during 2005 2012 qu et al 2014 the qugaqiong is mainly recharged by groundwater and there is no glacial runoff in this catchment thus both catchments show many similarities in geographical settings except for the condition of glaciation this provides an ideal backdrop to explore the impact of glaciation on chemical weathering of the central tp 3 methodology the sampling campaign for the qugaqiong and qugaqie had been carried out between april and september 2018 two monitoring sections downstream of the qugaqiong and qugaqie i e s2 and s1 c in fig 1 were chosen to obtain high resolution seasonal variation about runoff hydrochemistry and suspended particulate matter spm in addition stream water samples from tributaries of the qugaqie which have different recharge forms and bedrocks were collected to shed light on chemical weathering processes in these areas the sampling and monitoring methods are similar to previous research which was also conducted in this area yu et al 2019 and so we only describe it briefly here automatic water stage recorders onset hobo u20 were placed in the monitoring sections during the monitoring period with a resolution of 0 0014 m and accuracy of 0 1 synchronous runoff of the two rivers was obtained through the area velocity method proposed by us department of the interior 1997 in the middle of each month the cross sectional area was measured at an interval of 1 m using a steel dip sticks with a resolution of 0 01 m the water velocity was also measured at an interval of 1 m in the vertical at 0 6 of the depth below the surface using a propeller current meter jiangsu nanshui water technology ls1206b 1 5 for accuracy according to the research of rantz et al 1982 then synchronous runoff can be calculated by the cross sectional areas multiply water velocities rating curves were developed based on the relationship of synchronous discharge and continuously recorded water stages consequently the high temporal resolution of runoff during the monitoring period could be calculated using the rating curves a similar method has been applied by kumar et al 2019 in a himalayan glacierized basin and errors in runoff measurement are believed to 5 10 therefore the errors in the runoff determination of this study are estimated at less than 10 water temperature wt ph value and specific conductivity at 25 c of the stream water were measured in situ using a portable multi parameter meter hanna hi98129 with resolutions of 0 1 c 0 01 and 1 μs cm respectively the concentration of hco3 in river water was obtained in the field using the alkamerck alkalinity test merck with a resolution of 0 1 mmol l river water at s1 and s2 was sampled weekly using 1 l acid washed hdpe bottles nalgene stream water from tributaries of the qugaqie was collected in late may early june august and late september early october of 2016 2018 the rainwater at the nam co station for multisphere observation and research namor fig 1 was collected during the monitoring period in addition surface snow ice was sampled on the zhadang glacier genpu glacier and hanging glaciers with clean plastic bags 1242 ml nasco whirl pak the concentration of hco3 in rainfall and snow ice is calculated by ionic charge balance riverine sediments were also sampled using clean plastic bags 532 ml nasco whirl pak as a consequence 37 river water samples in the monitoring sections of the qugaqie and qugaqiong 23 glacial runoff samples 21 stream water samples in the non glacial tributary of the qugaqie 28 rainfall samples at the namor and 36 snow ice samples were collected all the samples were transported to the namor within two hours and stored in a refrigerator 18 c the samples were then transported to the key laboratory of tibetan environment changes and land surface processes lhasa branch chinese academy of sciences as soon as possible frozen treatment may result in calcite precipitation due to the enrichment effect in the freezing process however quick freeze and low tds of river water limited this precipitation and makes this process may only exert minor and negligible influences on the hydrochemistry of this study spm concentrations of river water were obtained by filtering a known weight of water samples through pre weighted lcr ptfe membrane filters diameter 47 mm pore size 0 45 μm millipore filtered water was used for the measurement of cations and anions riverine sediments were digested using hydrofluoric and nitric acid in a teflon beaker after leaching using acetic acid cations for all samples were measured using icp oes teledyne prodigy and anions were tested using ic dionex ics900 the sensitivity of cationic and anionic measurement is 0 001 mg l and 0 01 mg l with an accuracy of 2 and 5 respectively saturation of calcite dolomite and gypsum are calculated from hydrochemical data water temperature ph and concentrations of k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 using the modified program watspec wigley 1997 4 results molar ratio of ca na in riverine sediments of the qugaqiong qugaqie and zhadang glacierized catchment is 0 23 0 28 and 0 27 and the molar ratio of mg k is 0 19 0 11 and 0 14 respectively similar elemental ratios of riverine sediments further demonstrate that the lithology is similar in these catchments 4 1 runoff runoff of the qugaqiong during the period may to october 2018 was 0 15 108 m3 i e 625 mm in runoff depth and shows pronounced seasonal variation the peak occurs in july and was slightly lower in august total runoff in july and august accounts for over 60 to water flux during this monsoon season the minimum occurs in october which is only 13 of the runoff in july the seasonal variation of runoff is consistent with the change of precipitation recorded by the meteorological station the automatic water stage recorder in s1 was unfortunately lost hence we calculated the runoff in the qugaqie during the monitoring period based on the instantaneous water discharge data measured in the middle month of may to september 2018 the runoff of the qugaqie during the period may to september 2018 was 0 67 108 m3 and also shows remarked seasonal change the maximum and minimum value occurred in august and may 2018 respectively and the latter was only 12 of the former runoff in october 2016 only accounts for 6 of the total runoff in the monsoon season of this years yu et al 2019 additionally this parameter during the non monsoon period is only 5 of the total runoff for one hydrological year yu et al 2019 hence the absence of water flux data in october and the non monsoon season of 2018 did not cause significant uncertainty regarding the runoff calculation for the qugaqie the runoff of the qugaqie from may to september 2017 was calculated based on instantaneous water discharge data on the 15th of every month in this period the value is 0 46 108 m3 which is only 4 less than the result obtained by high resolution monitoring yu et al 2019 therefore this method does not cause a significant deviation from the actual situation in the study areas runoff of the qugaqie counted using instantaneous water discharge data in the middle of the month is an alternative method to obtain water discharge when a high resolution hydrological measurement is not available 4 2 physico chemical parameters water temperatures of the qugaqiong and qugaqie during the monitoring period range from 2 7 c to 14 0 c and 0 4 c to 12 1 c with mean values of 8 1 c and 7 4 c respectively seasonal variation of the former does not show any trend but the latter is consistent with the change of air temperature with higher values in august and lower values in late april the ph values of the qugaqiong and qugaqie range from 7 78 to 8 94 and 7 72 to 8 73 respectively the mean value of ph in both rivers is 8 23 and shows lower value in the mid monsoon season but higher in the beginning and end of this period the stream water of the qugaqie tributaries is also mildly alkaline and mean values range from 7 21 to 7 91 which is even lower than the mean value of river water from s1 during the monitoring period this illogical phenomenon is caused by the difference in sampling dates most stream water samples from the tributaries are collected in the mid monsoon season a large proportion of meltwater from snow ice and rainwater was flushed into the river making the ph values low due to ph values in the precipitation being relatively low li et al 2007 spm in river water of the qugaqiong and qugaqie varies from 0 13 mg l to 147 15 mg l and 10 26 mg l to 212 01 mg l with mean values of 11 64 mg l and 62 65 mg l respectively this demonstrates a 5 times higher spm concentration in the qugaqie river than in the qugaqiong river total dissolved solids tds k na ca2 mg2 sio2 cl no3 so4 2 hco3 in mg l is a parameter reflecting ionic concentration in water tds of the qugaqiong and qugaqie during the monitoring period ranges from 20 21 mg l to 43 98 mg l and 21 95 mg l to 71 00 mg l with mean values of 34 38 mg l and 33 02 mg l respectively mean tds values of the tributaries in the qugaqie vary from 17 01 mg l to 36 01 mg l 26 mg l on average this parameter in most tributaries of the qugaqie is lower than the mean value from s1 which is also caused by the difference in sampling dates aforementioned the major ionic elemental composition in river water of the qugaqiong and qugaqie is shown in table 1 cationic elemental concentration in these two rivers follows an order of ca2 na sio2 mg2 k and anionic concentration is hco3 so4 2 no3 cl as depicted in fig 2 ca2 is the dominant cation for all samples with proportions of over 50 of total cations the proportion of ca2 in river water of the qugaqiong and qugaqie ranges from 64 to 71 and 52 to 68 with mean values of 68 and 64 respectively the mean proportion of k na in the qugaqiong and qugaqie accounts for 18 14 23 and 24 18 38 of total cations whereas the mean proportion of mg2 in these two rivers is the lowest i e 14 13 17 in the qugaqiong and 12 10 14 in the qugaqie hco3 is the dominant anion and accounts for over 60 for most samples the mean proportion of hco3 to total anions in the qugaqiong and qugaqie reaches 79 70 86 and 70 59 77 respectively so4 2 is the second most important anion accounting for 19 and 28 on average in those two rivers respectively proportions of cl are minor with a mean value of 2 in both rivers glacial runoff shows a tiny difference in cationic composition from stream water of the non glacial tributaries nevertheless glacial runoff has lower hco3 but higher so4 2 in anionic composition ca2 and hco3 is the most important cation and anion respectively in all samples indicating the dissolution of carbonate may be a crucial geochemical process controlling hydrochemistry in the study areas however the qugaqiong river water has a higher proportion of ca2 and hco3 but lower so4 2 and k na compared with the qugaqie which means that the contribution of carbonate dissolution may be more important to solutes in the qugaqiong river water whereas sulfide oxidation and silicate weathering are more intense in the qugaqie catchment the mean value of total cationic charges tz of the qugaqiong and qugaqie during the monitoring period is 446 9 ranging from 292 0 to 598 6 μeq and 442 9 295 5 887 6 μeq respectively the mean value of total anionic charges tz in the stream water of the qugaqiong and qugaqie tributaries is 439 4 247 3 574 1 μeq and 421 1 276 9 906 1 μeq respectively the normalised inorganic charge balances nicb z z z 100 of the qugaqiong and qugaqie range from 8 to 15 and 7 to 17 with mean values of 7 and 2 respectively the nicb values in most samples are within 10 demonstrating most ions in river water of this study have been accurately measured the nicb values in runoff of the zhadang glacier and genpu glacier are higher but their mean values are also no more than 10 10 and 6 respectively the mean values of nicb in gw4 and gw5 are 0 and 3 respectively whereas this parameter in gw1 3 is 17 26 and 12 which may be caused by underestimation of hco3 in field measurement due to its low concentration all saturation indexes of calcite dolomite and gypsum are below 0 in river water of both the qugaqiong and qugaqie with mean values of 1 2 3 3 3 7 and 1 4 3 7 3 6 respectively this information indicates calcite dolomite and gypsum could still be dissolved by the river water and the possibility of precipitation of these minerals is low high spm concentration may influence ionic concentration through the exchange of divalent ions from solution for monovalent ions on surface exchange namely ca2 and mg2 is exchanged for na and k tranter 2003 high concentrations of spm in the qugaqie occurred in june 2018 with a mean value of 101 mg l while the minimum is five times lower in september 2018 19 mg l therefore more k and na should be released into the river water by the cationic exchange in june 2018 due to higher spm concentrations however the fact that the concentration of monovalent ions is 1 3 times higher in september 2018 invalidates this assumption thus the influence of ionic exchange with spm on ionic concentration is weak the chemical weathering processes and intensities in the study areas can be well constrained using the ionic concentration we obtained 5 discussion 5 1 sources of riverine solutes the atmospheric input needs to be excluded before distinguishing solutes originating from chemical weathering of rocks atmospheric input for the qugaqiong which is mainly recharged by groundwater is calculated using a rainwater correction method proposed by grosbois et al 2000 1 x x x cl rain cl ref x refers to ionic concentration in river water x denotes the corrected ionic concentration derived from precipitation x cl rain represents the molar ratio of ions and cl in rainwater clref is calculated by the evapotranspiration factor f multiplied by the weighted mean cl concentration of the rainwater furthermore f is obtained from the total amount of precipitation in mm y divided by the total runoff depth in mm y in this catchment all the cations in this equation are in μmol l rainwater samples were not collected in the qugaqie catchment nor in the qugaqiong catchment due to the logistic problem hence we take the rainwater samples collected at the namor as the rainfall endmember this may overestimate the contribution of atmospheric input to some extent due to ionic concentration may be lower in regions with higher elevation li et al 2007 lower concentration of cl in river water of the qugaqiong and non glacial runoffs of the qugaqie than the precipitation table 1 can ascribe to this reason however a significant difference in the concentration of other ions especially for cations between precipitation and river water makes this overestimation negligible the total runoff in the qugaqiong catchment was about 625 mm in 2018 which is even higher than the amount of monitored precipitation at the namor during this period this unexpected phenomenon can be explained by heavier precipitation in the alpine regions according to the records of the meteorological station in upstream of the qugaqie 5400 m above sea level near the sampling site of gw1 in fig 1 precipitation from june 2016 to may 2017 was about 760 mm while the precipitation at the namor during the same period was only 489 mm gao et al 2015 also found the precipitation in the zhadang glacier catchment was 27 higher than in the whole qugaqie catchment in 2007 and 2008 therefore we applied the f value 1 22 obtained in the niyaqu catchment 60 km away from the study area to exclude the input of precipitation at s2 yu et al 2019 this method is also applied for the non glacial runoffs of the qugaqie the precipitation correction at s1 was deciphered using the method proposed by yu et al 2019 the atmospheric input in the glacial runoffs is excluded using the mean ionic concentration of snow ice of the zhadang glaciers and the result is shown in fig 4 molar ratios of elements after the precipitation correction are good indicators of the sources of riverine solutes from chemical weathering gaillardet et al 1999 the molar ratio of ca2 na versus hco3 na and ca2 na versus mg2 na in river water of the qugaqiong qugaqie and its tributaries are shown in fig 3 denotes ions have been excluded from atmospheric input all samples fall between the endmembers of carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering which means chemical weathering of these two kinds of rock is the dominant factor controlling the hydrochemistry of the river water however significant spatial heterogeneity is also depicted in fig 3 most glacial runoffs are closer to the carbonate dissolution endmember than other river water the non glacial tributaries of the qugaqie are located in the middle of the endmembers between carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering some stream water at the monitoring section of the qugaqie s1 is unexpectedly closer to the silicate weathering endmember relative to other samples this phenomenon is caused by the difference in the sampling date of those samples as mentioned above the samples at s1 close to the silicate weathering endmember were collected at the very beginning of the monsoon season when the river is mainly recharged by groundwater and its residence time is relatively long than that of the mid monsoon season which favours silicate weathering hindshaw et al 2011 maher 2010 the glacial runoffs as a comparison are primarily recharged by meltwater with a high flush rate and short residence time this runoff regime favours the dissolution of carbonate minerals but suppresses silicate weathering anderson et al 1997 thus carbonate dissolution becomes more active than silicate weathering in the glacial environments even though the content of carbonate minerals is minor while silicate is abundant in bedrocks beneath the glaciers river water of the qugaqiong remains at the middle of the endmembers of carbonate and silicate dissolution and overlaps with most non glacial tributaries of the qugaqie indicating both the contributions from carbonate and silicate weathering are important for their riverine solutes molar ratios of ca2 na versus mg2 na in the river water even indicate some fraction of the solutes originates from evaporite dissolution however the absence of gypsum and halite layers in the study areas denied this assumption therefore we attribute all cl to atmospheric input and all so4 2 to sulfide oxidation after the correction from atmospheric input feng et al 2017 also attribute sulfate in the river of yamdrok co basin south of the nam co basin to pyrite weathering based on isotopic fingerprints the possibility that mg2 and na derive from the dissolution of sodium sulfate or other evaporites is also low due to the absence of these kinds of deposits mg2 and na in the study regions are believed to derive from carbonate and or silicate weathering ultimately we assumed riverine solutes in the study areas originate from atmospheric input sulfide oxidation chemical weathering of silicate and carbonate the forward model galy and france lanord 1999 was applied to quantify the contributions to riverine solutes of the qugaqiong and qugaqie furthermore the differences in chemical weathering processes caused by the difference in glaciation in the two catchments can be accurately evaluated the contribution of the sources to major cations in stream water of tributaries of the qugaqie is shown in fig 4 the mean contribution of atmospheric input silicate weathering carbonate dissolution and sulfide oxidation to the cations of the zhadang glacial runoff is 9 20 32 and 39 respectively sulfide oxidation is crucial in governing the hydrochemistry of this area and its value even reaches 50 at the end of the monsoon season the dissolution of carbonate is the second most important source while the contribution from silicate weathering seems less important the influence of atmospheric input on solutes in this runoff is also minute but slightly higher during the glacial ablation period with a peak of 14 in august sulfide oxidation is also the dominant source of riverine solutes in the hanging glacial runoff with a mean value of 36 carbonate dissolution is the second most important source accounting for 32 solutes originating from silicate weathering and atmospheric input are minor with mean contributions of 11 and 20 respectively carbonate dissolution becomes the dominant process controlling the evolution of solutes in the genpu glacial runoff with a mean value of 38 while the contribution of sulfide oxidation is slightly lower 32 the mean proportion of silicate weathering and atmospheric input is 16 and 19 respectively the lower proportion of sulfide oxidation in the genpu glacial runoff relative to that of the zhadang and hanging glacial runoff may be caused by the difference in the location of the sampling sites due to the difficulty in accessing the genpu glacier the sampling site for this runoff is much further away from the glacier snout c in fig 1 groundwater is an important source for the genpu glacier runoff on its sampling site because some creeks mainly recharged by groundwater flow into while this kind of influence on the zhadang glacial runoff and hanging glacial runoff is negligible obviously sulfide oxidation is active in catchments occupied by cold glaciers and hydrochemistry of the runoff in glacierized areas of this study is primarily controlled by this process this phenomenon is also revealed in other research conducted in temperate glaciers anderson et al 1997 2000 hindshaw et al 2016 shukla et al 2019 solutes in the non glacial tributaries have similar provenances except for gw5 the contribution of sulfide oxidation decreases markedly in gw1 4 compared with that of the glacial runoff with a mean value of 10 carbonate dissolution on the contrary becomes the most important source accounting for about 55 this distinct difference is caused by the absence of glaciation in gw1 4 even though they share similar lithology with the glacial areas the mean contribution of silicate is 20 which is close to the values in the runoff of the zhadang glacier and genpu glacier the mean value of atmospheric input is about 15 with a decreasing trend from upstream to downstream we speculate this spatial difference is caused by higher precipitation in upstream areas as discussed previously glacial comminution exposed trace sulfide minerals thus made sulfide oxidation became pretty active due to this reaction is much faster than other mineral dissolution besides glacier cover increases the probability of high ph weathering solutions by excluding the co2 from the atmosphere at the weathering site gíslason et al 1996 therefore carbonate dissolution is inhibited by high ph in the glacial runoff the lower contribution of carbonate weathering to solutes in the glacial runoff than that of the non glacial tributaries draining similar lithology is attributed to this mechanism as for riverine solutes in gw5 the mean contributions of sulfide oxidation and carbonate dissolution are close and both are about 35 solutes from silicate weathering and atmospheric input are 18 and 12 respectively a higher proportion of sulfide oxidation than in other non glacial tributaries may be caused by a higher content of sulfide minerals in bedrocks of the gw5 sandstone and slate sandstone is known to contain pyrite that dissolves oxidatively to produce sulfuric acid jin et al 2014 hindshaw et al 2016 also found sulfate comprised 72 86 of the summer anion budget and that sulfide oxidation is an important source of riverine solutes in a high arctic unglaciated catchment dominated by sandstone and shale in lithology solute sources for river water sampled in the monitoring sections s1 and s2 were also quantified by the forward model and the results are depicted in fig 5 as the monsoon season progresses the contribution of sulfide oxidation to cations of river water of the qugaqie increases from 20 at the beginning of the season to 35 at the end of the monsoon season 2018 the mean proportion of sulfide oxidation to cations in the qugaqie is 24 the proportion of atmospheric input is minor in the beginning and end of the monsoon season 6 but reaches 18 in the middle of this season this seasonal variation coincides with the glacial ablation period the mean contribution of atmospheric input during the monitoring period is about 14 contributions of carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering are quite close for the whole qugaqie catchment both are about 31 but show different seasonal variation patterns silicate weathering is higher in the early monitoring period with a percentage of 54 but decreases markedly in the middle period about 26 the contribution of carbonate dissolution shows a contrary tendency with a higher percentage in the middle period 34 than that of the beginning 25 and end of the monitoring period 27 the pronounced seasonal variation for these sources in the qugaqie catchment is caused by the seasonal change in recharge forms in the beginning and end of the monsoon season river water is mainly recharged by groundwater while the contribution from meltwater of the glacier is minor due to the low temperature hence silicate weathering is the dominant geochemical process controlling hydrochemistry due to the main recharge form being groundwater and its long residence time favours silicate weathering however the contribution of glacial meltwater can reach 81 from june to july gao et al 2015 becoming the most important source of river water in the mid monsoon season because of the intense ablation of the glaciers therefore the contributions of sulfide oxidation and carbonate dissolution are higher at s1 during the mid monsoon season because most water comes from glacial runoff which has high proportions of sulfide oxidation and carbonate dissolution in solutes the disparities of mean contributions of sources to riverine solutes are minor in terms of values calculated from late april to late september 2018 and the values obtained in a hydrological year yu et al 2019 in the qugaqie catchment both the atmospheric input and sulfide oxidation are 4 higher but silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution are 4 lower in this study the differences may be caused by the absence of monitoring during the non monsoon season in this study the mean contribution of atmospheric input sulfide oxidation silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution to riverine solutes of the qugaqiong during the monitoring period is 13 17 22 and 48 respectively those are completely different from the contributions at s1 but similar to the non glacial tributaries which drain granodiorite biotite or adamellite highlighting that chemical weathering processes are similar in catchments sharing similar bedrocks and recharge forms it is worth noting that the contribution of atmospheric input in the qugaqiong is lower than that of the qugaqie the higher contribution of atmospheric input in the qugaqie is caused by the extra recharge of meltwater from the glaciers in addition to rainfall inputs in contrast to the qugaqie the percentage of sources of riverine solutes in the qugaqiong only show minute seasonal variation this phenomenon is also found in the niyaqu catchment eastern nam co which is mainly recharged by groundwater too yu et al 2019 the minor seasonal variation may be caused by the difference in groundwater residence time in the monsoon season of 2018 the seasonal change of the proportion of atmospheric input in the qugaqiong is even consistent with the seasonal variation of runoff and precipitation this coincidence illustrated the accuracy of the model we used to quantify sources of riverine solutes and that the results we obtained are robust 5 2 chemical weathering rates chemical weathering rates in the qugaqiong catchment are calculated using solute flux collected in a high frequency sampling campaign multiplied by daily runoff on the sampling date whereas chemical weathering rates in the qugaqie catchment are obtained using solute flux multiplied by runoff in the middle of every month of the monitoring period due to lack of high resolution hydrological data uncertainty regarding the calculation of chemical weathering rates in the study areas resulting from this method is mainly produced from the following aspects 1 the calculation of annual runoff the error in the runoff measurement is estimated as 10 as discussed above 2 the determination of cationic concentration the accuracy of cationic measurements is 2 then 2 uncertainty will be caused when we calculated cationic flux by these 5 cations k na ca2 mg2 and sio2 the total error caused in the calculation of chemical weathering rates can be evaluated by the error propagation equation of σ w r σ q 2 σ c 2 where σwr denotes error in the calculation of chemical weathering rates σq and σc represents the error in runoff measurement and ionic concentration test respectively namely the uncertainty of chemical weathering rates calculation in the study regions is 10 the absence of monitoring work during october and non monsoon season in the qugaqie may produce underestimation to some extent however this underestimation is minor according to the previous research conducted in this catchment even though this uncertainty is difficult to be quantified yu et al 2019 the runoff during october and non monsoon season 2017 accounted for 11 of the annual runoff according to previous research yu et al 2019 this value may be applicable to the neighbouring qugaqiong because they share similar geographical characteristics besides runoff of the qugaqie calculated by instantaneous water discharge data in the middle of every month may result in an underestimation of 4 compared to that by high resolution monitoring according to the data obtained in monsoon season 2017 yu et al 2019 in addition the absence of monitoring work during october and non monsoon season 2018 may also produce some underestimation in cationic concentration ca2 mg2 car and k na ca2 mg2 sil of the qugaqie river water is 17 and 30 lower in the monitoring work from may to september 2017 than the annual values respectively yu et al 2019 however the condition that only 11 runoff occurred in this period makes the errors in ionic concentration calculation reduced to 2 and 3 for carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering respectively carbonate weathering rate cwr in the qugaqiong catchment is relatively high from june to august 2018 with a mean value of 19 6 t km2 y the maximum occurs in june 2018 21 6 t km2 y and is caused by the comparably high concentration of ca2 mg2 and hco3 which mainly originates from carbonate dissolution silicate weathering rate swr increases as the monsoon season progresses and the maximum occurs in september 2018 12 0 t km2 y the high value in september is caused by high concentrations of cations elements i e k na and sio2 which originate from silicate weathering additionally the runoff of the qugaqiong is still high this month the minimum cwr and swr values occur in may 2018 and this phenomenon is attributed to the lowest runoff being in this period the maximum cwr and swr in the qugaqie catchment occur in august 2018 with mean values of 41 5 t km2 y and 27 4 t km2 y respectively the minimum of both cwr and swr in this catchment also occur in may 2018 with mean values of 5 3 t km2 y and 6 1 t km2 y respectively seasonal variation of chemical weathering rates is in accordance with the temporal change of runoff indicating the seasonal change of chemical denudation intensities in the qugaqie catchment is controlled by runoff this assumption has also been revealed in previous research yu et al 2019 we compared the correlations between the cwr and swr with runoff wt and physical erosion rates per in the qugaqiong catchment to explore the governing factor for seasonal variation of chemical weathering rates in this region the results are shown in fig 7 both the cwr and swr in the qugaqiong show a significant positive correlation with runoff but a low correlation with wt the correlation between the cwr and per is lower than the correlation between the swr and per this indicates runoff is the most important factor in controlling the seasonal variation of chemical weathering rates the influence of temperature on seasonal variation of chemical denudation rates seems to be covered by other factors even though the cwr increases roughly with rising temperatures the relationship between the cwr and swr with per shows a logarithmic function with a threshold value of 4 t km2 y the swr increases rapidly when per less than 4 t km2 y but the increment becomes insignificant when per is over this threshold the relationship between swr with per in the qugaqie also shows a similar pattern but its threshold is 100 t km2 y yu et al 2019 the notable difference in threshold is caused by glaciation in the qugaqie catchment large quantities of rock flour caused by comminution at the bottom of the glaciers can be flushed into the river water of the qugaqie whereas most rock detritus is filtrated by soil or sediments in the qugaqiong catchment even though numerous particles are formed due to strong physical erosion processes such as frost shattering hall et al 2002 the higher elevation and slope in the qugaqie catchment are also beneficial to the transportation of particles the cwr and swr of the qugaqiong and qugaqie in a hydrological year are calculated from the data obtained during the monitoring period and we assume there is no chemical exhumation in the other months of 2018 the absence of monitoring in the non monsoon period would not cause a significant deviation from the actual situation for the reasons discussed before the cwr and swr in the qugaqie catchment during 2018 are 9 7 t km2 y and 6 7 t km2 y respectively these values are 7 and 10 higher than the corresponding values from october 2016 to september 2017 9 1 t km2 y and 6 1 t km2 y respectively yu et al 2019 higher values in 2018 are caused by higher runoff in this period annual runoff in 2018 and from october 2016 to september 2017 was about 0 67 108m3 and 0 48 108m3 respectively which means runoff in 2018 was 40 higher than that in the period from october 2016 to september 2017 such an interannual variation is not unexpected because the runoff from may to september 2018 is very close to the value from may to october 2016 0 69 108m3 the cwr and swr in the qugaqiong are 6 9 t km2 y and 3 8 t km2 y respectively the cwr and swr in the qugaqie is 1 4 and 1 8 times higher than that in the qugaqiong catchment indicating glaciation in the qugaqie increased chemical weathering rate of both carbonate and silicate chemical weathering processes are similar in catchments of the qugaqiong and the non glacial tributaries of the qugaqie chemical denudation intensities may also be comparable due to similarities in lithology recharge form and other geographical characteristics hence the difference in chemical weathering rates between the qugaqiong and qugaqie catchments is mainly caused by the glacierized regions as mentioned above carbonate dissolution is the second most important source of solutes in the glacial runoff about 33 while this contribution to riverine solutes in the qugaqiong and non glacial tributaries of the qugaqie reaches 48 higher runoff in the glacierized regions results in higher cwr than the groundwater recharge areas even though the contribution of carbonate dissolution is relatively low in glacial runoff there this hypothesis can be supported by the fact that runoff of the qugaqie during the monitoring period is 1 8 times higher than the corresponding value of the qugaqiong 1155 mm and 625 mm respectively as for the swr the contribution of silicate weathering to riverine solutes in the glacial zones and non glacial areas of the qugaqie is similar both are about 19 and the proportion of this source to solutes in the qugaqiong is 22 moreover the quantity of tds in these rivers is close table 1 therefore more runoff in the glacial zones would enhance silicate weathering runoff of the qugaqie is 1 8 times higher than that of the qugaqiong while the swr in the former catchment is also 1 8 times higher this coincidence further demonstrates the governing impact of runoff on silicate weathering the mean per values in the qugaqie and qugaqiong catchments are 195 9 t km2 y and 26 9 t km2 y respectively as analysed previously the correlations between per with the cwr and swr are significant in the qugaqiong catchment per is also an important environmental factor governing chemical weathering rates in the qugaqie catchment yu et al 2019 fresh rock flour caused by subglacial abrasion and grinding along with disruption of mineral lattices and high surface area make glacial sediments exceptionally weatherable anderson et al 1997 in addition the mineral surface area increases with glacial runoffs anderson 2005 those factors make the proportions of solutes originated from silicate weathering in the glacial regions are comparable with that in the non glacial catchments thus the 7 3 times higher per in the qugaqie provided abundant materials for chemical weathering and is also responsible for higher swr in this region anderson 2005 analysed the relationship between per and silica flux in glacial catchments and concluded the production of new reactive mineral surface area by glacial erosion drives silicate weathering fluxes it is worth noting that the correlation between runoff and per is significant in both catchments i e per increase sharply with the increment of runoff and their relationship can be well constrained by an exponential equation thus runoff may exert a profound influence on per in the study areas the high runoff period often accompanied by high per due to the transportation of particles can be greatly enhanced at that time therefore the relationships between runoff per and chemical denudation rates are highly coupled and inter related despite the predominance of carbonate weathering and sulfide oxidation in most glacial systems silicate mineral weathering could also be enhanced under certain hydrological conditions such as within long residence time distributed subglacial drainage system hindshaw et al 2011 tranter et al 2002 urra et al 2019 the chilly climate in the glacierized region of the qugaqie makes the distributed flowpaths becomes the predominant way there is only one moulin on the smooth surface of the zhadang glacier during the ablation period that demonstrated this assumption fig 8 this situation may be also prevalent in other cold glaciers drainage systems in the qugaqie catchment due to they share a similar geographical environment ca si ratio in glacial runoff could shed light on the geochemical processes that occurred in the subglacial system hindshaw et al 2011 the elevated ca si ratio is thought to be caused by enhanced calcite dissolution while the low ca si ratio indicates silicate weathering is more intensity secondary calcite precipitation or re dissolvement may change this elemental ratio dramatically however the low saturation index of calcite and dolomite abbreviate as sic and sid respectively in the glacial runoff of the qugaqie catchment denied this hypothesis the values of sic and sid of the zhadang glacial runoff ranged from 2 65 to 0 81 and 6 11 to 2 30 with an average of 1 85 and 4 52 respectively all these values below than 0 throughout the monitoring period indicate that this glacial runoff is far from equilibration and calcite and dolomite can still be dissolved for instance sic and sid for samples collected at 10 00 october 6 2017 is only 1 89 and 4 72 respectively even though riverine solutes concentration is relatively high in this period this situation may also prevail in other glacierized regions of the qugaqie catchment due to they share similar lithology and other environmental settings hence we believe the possibility of calcite precipitation in glacierized regions of the qugaqie catchment is low and its influence on the evolvement of ca2 si is minor as depicted in fig 8 the ca si ratio of the qugaqie is low with values close to 1 5 before the indian monsoon arrived denotes after the atmospheric input correction this parameter increased slightly at the beginning of the monsoon season but the increment becomes sharply with the monsoon season progresses and formed a peak from june 15 to july 4 2018 when snow melting is intense ca si ratio decreased significantly and became relatively stable after july 4 2018 with an average of 2 0 obviously hydrochemistry of the qugaqie river water is characterized by a low ca si ratio in most periods indicating the glacial drainage system was dominated by the distributed pattern waters of the delayed flow are relatively concentrated because they flow through the distributed system where they are in contact with large quantities of relatively reactive recently comminuted rock flour and importantly because there is a renewable supply of protons available to sustain prolonged chemical weathering tranter et al 1993 slow transit of water and relatively long residence time in the distributed drainage system makes rock water interaction stronger which promotes silicate mineral weathering due to its relatively low rates of dissolution this mechanism has been revealed by tranter et al 2002 and they think the longer residence times of water in the distributed drainage system allow silicate weathering to occur kumar et al 2019 also proved the prevailing of a distributed subglacial drainage system in the chhota shigri glacial catchment generates more solutes during the positive annual mass balances period especially for ions originated from silicate weathering the peak of ca si ratio from june 15 to july 4 2018 infers drainage system during this period may be dominated by a channelized pattern when snow cover thaws out and moulin becomes an effective channel to the migration of meltwater to the glacier bed the accumulated water caused by the ablation of snow and ice may break through the barriers under the glacier which may be the reason for the formation of a channelized drainage system in a cold glacier the channelized drainage system allows carbonate dissolution to become more important compared with that in a distributed system due to the short residence time of water in the former the higher proportion of carbonate dissolution to total cations of the qugaqie from june 15 to july 4 2018 and the maximum occurred on june 15 39 consisting with the seasonal variation of ca si ratio illustrated this assumption however more observations are needed to clarify the seasonal evolvement of the drainage system in the subglacial drainage system of qugaqie catchment 5 3 comparison with other glacierized areas in order to understand the chemical weathering intensity of the qugaqie which is partly occupied by cold glaciers we compiled the chemical denudation rates and environmental features of this catchment i e bedrocks drainage area runoff depth and glacier coverage with other glacial areas unfortunately studies on chemical weathering rates in glacierized catchments are still scarce and some of them do not describe the cwr and swr therefore we have only compiled the total cationic denudation rates tcdr to represent chemical weathering intensity in the study areas of the referenced work the results are shown in table 2 the tcdr of the qugaqie catchment is moderate when compared with other glacierized areas we compiled chemical weathering rates of the qugaqie are close to these catchments which have similar bedrocks i e igneous rocks diorite and gneiss axtmann and stallard 1995 hasnain et al 1989 sharp et al 1995 wu 2018 however the value in the qugaqie is much lower than catchments with rocks which are susceptible to dissolution such as evaporite carbonate and basalt but higher than catchments with weathering resistant rocks crystalline rock sandstone and granite church 1974 gíslason et al 1996 hasnain and thayyen 1996 hodson et al 2002 hodgkins et al 1997 león and pedrozo 2015 singh et al 2019 wu 2018 obviously lithology is crucial to tcdr in glacierized areas for instance tcdr in tunuyán glacial catchment dominated by evaporite could reach 128 0 t km2 y even though runoff depth is only 320 mm león and pedrozo 2015 however some catchments dominated by granite or gneiss have a distinct difference in tcdr gneiss is the most widespread bedrock in both chhota shigri and barnes while tcdr in the former is nearly eight times higher church 1974 hasnain et al 1989 therefore other environmental factors may also influence the spatial distribution of the tcdr to some extent as depicted in fig 9 tcdr increases with the increment of runoff and shows a significant positive correlation p 0 05 runoff reflecting the amount of meltwater in a glacierized catchment benefits chemical weathering because water is a necessary and crucial factor in this process moreover water can facilitate glacier movement on bedrocks by acting as a sliding agent resulting in plenty of weatherable materials been produced by intense crushing and grinding of subglacial bedrock and sediments of glaciers the significant positive correlation between the tcdr and runoff demonstrated those hypotheses the correlations between tcdr with drainage area and glacial coverage are insignificant p 0 05 indicating the influence of those factors on tcdr is minor from the perspective of glacierized catchments compiled in this study lithology in these catchments with large drainage areas is often complex and contain more easily weathered stratum or minerals which may be the reason for the higher tcdr in catchments with a broad area such as the batura glacierized catchment hodson et al 2002 however some large catchments are also dominated by a single lithology for instance the rocks in the barnes glacierized area are dominated by granite and gneiss church 1974 even though the drainage area of this catchment can reach 205 km2 weathering resistant rocks meybeck 1987 couple with low runoff caused the extremely low tcdr in this catchment hence the correlation between drainage area and tcdr is weak even though they roughly increase in parallel not all rocks in such high glacial coverage catchments are weatherable or weathering resistant in addition glacial coverage does not show a significant correlation with runoff fig 9 therefore the influence of glacial coverage on chemical weathering rates is insignificant and its impact may be overwhelmed by the influence of lithology and runoff the low correlations between tcdr with the drainage area and glacial coverage however may also be an artifact of limited data in addition the dataset of tcdr we compiled from other literature is obtained by different sampling strategy and most of them based on short observation periods which may partly responsible for the low correlations therefore more reliable chemical weathering rates obtained by high frequency sampling and long monitoring periods need to be accumulated in the future works to better explore the processes and controlling factors of chemical weathering in glacierized catchments of the world 6 conclusions the qugaqiong and qugaqie located on the central tp share similar geographical characteristics except for several cold glaciers located upstream in the qugaqie catchment this study investigates whether cold glaciers influence processes and intensities of chemical weathering on the tp the analysis of glacial runoff shows that sulfide oxidation is the most dominant source of riverine solutes and followed by carbonate dissolution the qugaqiong and non glacial tributaries of the qugaqie draining granodiorite biotite adamellite share similar hydrochemistry the evolution of riverine solutes in those catchments is governed by carbonate dissolution and the contribution from sulfide oxidation is much lower than that of the glacierized areas the cwr in catchments of the qugaqie and qugaqiong is 9 7 t km2 y and 6 9 t km2 y this similarity can be explained by lower runoff depth coupled with higher contribution of carbonate dissolution to solutes in the qugaqiong and higher runoff depth combined with lower contribution of carbonate dissolution in glacierized areas of the qugaqie the swr in the qugaqie and qugaqiong is 6 7 t km2 y and 3 8 t km2 y respectively the 1 4 times higher cwr and 1 8 times higher swr in the qugaqie catchment is attributed to the 1 8 times higher runoff depth and 7 3 times higher per in this glacierized catchment the drainage system of the glacier is dominated by the distributed pattern which caused longer residences time of water thus further promoted chemical weathering in the glacierized region our results emphasize that glaciation enhances chemical weathering on the central tp tcdr in the qugaqie catchment remains at a moderate level compared with other glacierized catchments in the world lithology and runoff are crucial to the spatial heterogeneity of chemical denudation rates in these catchments however more data with high quality dealing with chemical weathering rates in the glacial environment are still needed in future works to better understand the chemical weathering and its controlling factors in glacierized regions of the world especially on the tp where glacier is ubiquitous credit authorship contribution statement zhengliang yu conceptualization investigation

4618,ocean surge inundation occurs frequently in low lying coastal areas worldwide while studies have been conducted to examine aquifer salinization and recovery caused by ocean surge inundation evaporation is predominantly overlooked based on numerical simulations considering variably saturated density dependent pore water flow and salt transport this study examines the combined effects of evaporation and ocean surge inundation on soil salinization in coastal unconfined aquifers the results show that evaporation enhances soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation due to evaporation induced water uptake the downward movement of salt is weakened and the salt from the ocean surge inundation is significantly trapped in the unsaturated zone the pore water salinity in the shallow soil layer is increased by soil evaporation particularly in the low elevation area with longer seawater inundation the sensitive analysis shows that the evaporation enhanced soil salinization is more remarkable for silt loam and clay loam aquifers rather than sandy loam aquifers a higher mean sea level favors salt trapping in the shallow soil layer of aquifers these results demonstrate the importance of evaporation on soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation and that could be considered in future studies keywords soil salinization evaporation ocean surge aquifer numerical simulation 1 introduction soil salinization is a global issue threatening vegetation and crops resulting in ecosystem degradation and challenging global food security fao 2020 in densely populated and low lying coastal areas soil salinization is mainly caused by seawater intrusion lateral movement of coastal seawater into freshwater aquifers ataie ashtiani et al 2013 ferguson and gleeson 2012 michael et al 2013 werner et al 2013 and ocean surge inundation coastal flooding due to anomalous sea level height associated with low pressure weather systems gingerich et al 2017 illangasekare et al 2006 violette et al 2009 yu et al 2016 due to global climate change sea level rise is accelerated and ocean storm surges become frequent along the global coastline hoffman et al 2010 lowe and gregory 2005 marcos et al 2011 storlazzi et al 2015 ipcc 2013 the combination of the two would cause seawater to overtop coastal dykes and flood inland areas fig 1 in general ocean surge inundation has three stages i with the approach of an intense cyclone the sea level height increases and surges move towards the onshore aquifer fig 1a ii surges run up and seawater overtops the crest of the coastal dyke fig 1b iii seawater inundates low elevation areas and infiltrates into coastal soils resulting in soil salinization fig 1c ocean surge inundation causes dense saltwater to overlie light freshwater thus developing saline plumes liu and tokunaga 2019 xiao et al 2019 inundation seriously threatens freshwater storage in low lying areas through salt contamination chui and terry 2013 gingerich et al

mineral weathering man made salinization of irrigation long term impacts to freshwater can be caused by vertical infiltration of only a small amount of seawater yang et al 2013 the field investigation

and terry 2012 shallow soils with high permeability allow more saltwater to get through during seawater inundation facilitating salt transport into an aquifer giambastiani et al 2017 when ocean surge inundation occurs an thicker unsaturated zone can collect a larger amount of saltwater holding and allen 2015b moreover yu et al 2016 demonstrated that coastal topographic features e g dykes ponds dunes and channels are important for controlling seawater infiltration and groundwater salinization by affecting runoff process and infiltration time the results from a field investigation showed that depressions become an continuing source of salt contamination to an aquifer after ocean storm surges terry and falkland 2010 the recovery time for an aquifer with high permeability is relatively short in comparison with that with low permeability holding and allen 2015b yang et al 2018 geological heterogeneity also affect the recovery of aquifer salinization holding and allen 2015b mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 vithanage et al 2012 mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 found that aquifer heterogeneity would reduce the volume of intruding saltwater in an ocean surge inundation event in comparison with a homogenous aquifer vithanage et al 2012 conducted laboratory experiments and showed that a layered configuration can greatly change migration paths of saline plumes and also the recovery time of the aquifer while these previous studies have advanced our understanding of soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation evaporation is predominantly overlooked evaporation is a vital hydrological factor affecting water circulation and balance in almost all water systems it is well established that evaporation can remove freshwater from soils but leave salt behind inducing soil salinization paine 2003 the salt accumulation caused by evaporation can also change density dependent groundwater flow shen et al 2018 wang et al 2007 xin et al 2017 geng et al 2016 found that the pore water salinity in beach intertidal zone is much higher than seawater salinity due to evaporation the evaporation rate depends on soil types and local groundwater depths geng and boufadel 2017 najib et al 2016 trabelsi et al 2012 despite the possible importance combined effects of evaporation and ocean surge inundation on soil salinization remain unclear to fill this research gap we investigated numerically the soil salinization process in unconfined aquifers after ocean surge inundation three commonly encountered soil types were considered to examine pore water flow and salinity distributions subjected to evaporation the results help to address the following key research questions 1 how does evaporation change the water exchange between inundating seawater and the aquifer after ocean surge inundation 2 how does evaporation affect salinity distributions in the shallow soil layer 3 how does evaporation influence change with soil types and mean sea levels 2 conceptual model and numerical simulations in this study a vertical cross section of a coastal unconfined aquifer was considered the configuration is given in fig 1d the aquifer was assumed to be hydraulically homogeneous and isotropic a dyke was located at the seaward boundary ad the slope of soil surface cd was set to 0 002 i e mild slope the dyke was allowed to pond the overtopping seawater caused by ocean surges to focus on soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation and evaporation rainfall infiltration was excluded in this study therefore the ponded seawater can infiltrate into the aquifer and be evaporated from both the water and soil surface fig 1d the aquifer was assumed to be laterally bounded by the mean sea level and the landward groundwater table boundaries ad and bc respectively the aquifer bottom ab was set to be an impermeable base as widely adopted previously bittelli et al 2008 geng and boufadel 2015 shen et al 2018 xin et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 a soil evaporation model based on a bulk aerodynamic approach was adopted as follows 1 e ρ a min 1 1 8 φ s ss φ s ss 0 3 0 622 p v p a 0 378 p v q a 94 909 u w 0 9036 2 p v 0 6108 e 17 27 t s t s 237 3 where

respectively p v and p a are the saturated vapor pressure m l 1 t 2 and the atmospheric pressure at the soil surface m l 1 t 2 respectively u w is the wind speed l t 1 t s is the temperature at the soil surface c in this study we set parameters as ρ a 1 205 kg m3 q a 0 0072 t s 15 c p a 101 kpa u w 3 m s φ 0 45 these settings give a potential evaporation rate i e water surface evaporation at 10 mm d fig 2 a which is commonly encountered in coastal areas sperna weiland et al 2012 for the ponded surface water upward evaporation i e 10 mm d and downward infiltration were considered the variations of surface water level and salinity were calculated by the following equations based on the principle of mass balance 3 v f v t v i v e 4 m f m t ρ f v i ρ w v e 5 m s m st m si 6 m si ρ f v i c s 7 ρ f m f v f 8 c s m s m f where v t is the total volume of ocean surge inundation v f and m f represent the volume l 3 and mass m of the ponded surface water respectively m t and m st are the water and salt mass of ocean surge inundation respectively m v i and v e are the water loss due to infiltration and evaporation respectively l 3 note that the two are determined by the groundwater model and the evaporation model respectively m s and m si are the salt mass of the ponded surface water and the infiltrated water respectively m ρ f is the density of the ponded surface water m l 3 and ρ w is the density of freshwater m l 3 c s is the salinity of the ponded surface water the initial density 1025 kg m3 and salinity 35 ppt of the ponded surface water were assigned to be the same of seawater it is worth noting that we considered evaporation that takes up freshwater only the density and salinity of the ponded surface water are expected to increase due to evaporation this is different from the previous studies excluding evaporation chui and terry 2013 holding and allen 2015b yang et al 2018 yu et al 2016 the variably saturated density dependent pore water flow and salt transport in the aquifer was simulated using sutra voss and provost 2010 the governing equations are given as follows 9 ρ φ s w t ρ q ρ f q 10 q k ψ p ρ g z 11 φ s w ρ c t ρ q c φ s w ρ d c ρ f q c s where q is the darcy velocity l t 1 and k ψ is the relative hydraulic conductivity l t 1 depending on the pore water pressure head ψ l q is the fluid sink t 1 caused by soil evaporation s w is the

respectively d is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor l 2 t 1 ρ is the pore water density m l 3 and ρ f is the density of the fluid sink m l 3 the pore water density was assumed to be linearly associated with the salinity ρ ρ 0 ξ c where ρ 0 is the freshwater density m l 3 and ξ is a constant value equaling to 714 3 kg m3 k ψ and s w are approximated using the van genuchten 1980 formulas as

water saturation α l 1 and n are water retention parameters in the model boundary ab was set to a no flow boundary the landward boundary bc and seaward boundary ad were assigned to fixed head boundaries the surface of the aquifer cd was set as the time variant boundary for those nodes submerged by the surface water the pressure was specified according to the thickness of the overlying surface water satisfying hydrostatic pressure distribution for those nodes exposed no overlying surface water the boundary condition was two fold if the previously calculated pore water pressure was larger than zero seepage face was allowed to develop and the associated pressure was set to zero otherwise the nodes were specified as a flux boundary with soil evaporation dependent on soil water saturation at the soil surface for the section with the submerged nodes and seepage face water surface evaporation was considered the evaporation flux was coupled into the model via the sink in sutra salt was retained in soils through the solute source when water was evaporated xin et al 2017 the surface water was coupled into the groundwater model by setting up the specified head boundary we calculated the total volume of infiltrated surface water influx calculated by sutra through the boundary nodes boundary cd at each time step then the volume of ponded saltwater and the surface water elevation were determined based on water mass balance until the ponded water disappeared using eqs 3 and 4 the surface water was assumed to be well mixed and with a uniform salinity since evaporation took up freshwater but left salt behind the salinity of ponded saltwater was accumulated based on salt mass balance eq 5 eight simulation cases were conducted with three common soil types in coastal areas silt loam clay loam and sandy loam considered details are given in table 1 the cases with evaporation were compared with those without evaporation for all the three soil types cases 1 6 parameter values for the selected soil types table 1 were referred from carsel and parrish 1988 the soil water retention curves are presented in fig 2b the landward groundwater table elevation h f was set to 23 0 m water salinity set to 0 ppt the mean sea level h s was set to 22 0 m for cases 1 6 water salinity set to 35 ppt focusing on silt loam we also conducted two additional simulations with increased mean sea levels the results help to understand the impact of sea level rise in all the simulations the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were set to 0 5 m and 0 05 m respectively hunt et al 2011 the molecular diffusivity was set to 10 9 m2 s voss and provost 2010 the modelled aquifer was discretized into 65 400 elements 66 110 nodes the horizontal mesh size was uniform 1 3 m the vertical mesh was refined for the top 6 m soil layer with a mesh size of 0 005 m for all the simulations the model was initially run to the steady state pressure and salinity unchanged with the specified seaward and landward water levels then an inundation event was introduced and the elevation of the surface water level was set to 25 4 m note that the whole aquifer was initially inundated i e the per unit width volume of the overlying seawater were 40 m3 then the model was run for 1 year with a time step of 120 s 3 results in this section we first focus on silt loam and discuss the salinization process caused by ocean surge inundation section 3 1 then effects of soil types and mean sea levels on soil salinization are discussed respectively in section 3 2 and section 3 3 it should be noted that the denser seawater laterally intruded into the lower aquifer resulting in a saltwater wedge as illustrated in fig 1d this saltwater wedge is expected to be altered by ocean surge inundation mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 as well established by previous studies mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 yang et al 2018 the lateral movement of the saltwater wedge in the deep aquifer is insensitive to ocean surge inundation therefore we focused on pore water flow and salinity distributions in the shallow aquifer note that saltwater wedges developed in deep aquifers are not demonstrated due to the layouts of figures given later 3 1 effect of evaporation on soil salinization process initially the pore water salinity pws in the shallow soil layer was 0 and the groundwater table was controlled by landward and seaward boundaries increasing from x 0 to 200 m fig 3 a as expected the overlying seawater caused by ocean surge inundation infiltrated into the silt loam aquifer k s 1 23 10 6 m s α 2 0 m 1 and n 1 41 of which the shallow soil layer was initially unsaturated fig 3 as a result saline plumes developed and expanded in the aquifer without and with the consideration of evaporation fig 3 without evaporation the salinity of surface water remained unchanged 35 ppt during the period of infiltration fig 4 e at day 1 the elevation of surface water decreased to 25 22 m fig 4b approximately 70 of surface water infiltrated into the aquifer in the first day fig 4a as the seaward soils were with lower elevations the surface water kept entering the soils whereas water infiltration had stopped for the landward area the saline plume became thicker at the seaward fig 3c consistent with the impact of surface depressions discussed by holding and allen 2015a the pws in the shallow soil layer reached the seawater salinity 35 ppt due to infiltration of the ponded seawater the infiltration process of the ponded surface water lasted for 2 8 d without evaporation the variation of the water volume became mild after day 1 resulting from the smaller infiltration rate with the decreased surface water soil interface fig 4a and 4d the saline plume expanded downward in the unsaturated zone continuously fig 3 the pws was reduced to 31 1 ppt at day 5 due to the downward migration of saltwater driven by gravity and the density gradient to quantify the expansion of the saline plume we averaged the elevations of the 5 seawater isohaline along the x direction hereinafter termed as 5 seawater front it was found that from day 1 to day 5 the 5 seawater front moved from 24 60 to 24 08 m the ponded saltwater recharged the groundwater and raised the groundwater table the effect of inundation on the groundwater table was found to be prolonged for silt loam the recovery of the groundwater table was slow the results demonstrated a convex shape of the groundwater table with the peak elevation 23 20 m appeared at x 90 3 m at day 100 fig 3g in this way the unsaturated zone contracted and that could inhibit the downward expansion of the saline flume the 5 seawater front lowered by 0 53 m from day 5 to day 100 similar to that from day 1 to day 5 the expansion of the saline plume gradually slowed down with only 0 27 m downward migration for the 5 seawater front from day 100 to day 300 fig 3g and 3i the groundwater table did not change obviously at day 300 in comparison with that at day 100 suggesting that groundwater flow in the silt loam aquifer was slow without evaporation saltwater in the shallow soil layer was gradually mixed with fresh groundwater and the pws decreased to 26 9 ppt at day 300 with evaporation the time taken for the surface water infiltration decreased by 0 2 d in comparison with the case without evaporation i e the water from ocean surge inundation entered the aquifer with less time the volume 11 41 versus 12 41 m3 at day 1 and the elevation 25 21 versus 25 22 m at day 1 of the surface water decreased quicker in comparison with the case without evaporation fig 4a and 4b the infiltration process was regulated by evaporation from the water surface the flux of evaporation varied from 2 00 to 1 06 m3 d during the first day fig 4c removing a total of 1 46 m3 surface water concurrently the volume of infiltrating water decreased by 0 46 m3 in comparison with the case without evaporation the salinity of surface water increased due to evaporation the salinity of surface water increased to 37 4 ppt at day 1 and the pws in the shallow soil layer slightly exceeded the seawater salinity 35 ppt it was found that the salinity of surface water increased significantly during the end of infiltration after day 2 fig 4e this led to the significantly increased pws at the seaward soils the pws reached 57 2 ppt at day 5 different from the case without evaporation the pore water can be evaporated from coastal soils without overlying water this contributed to the changed salinity distribution a hypersaline plume was developing due to both evaporation from water and soil surface fig 3f evaporation from soils can be classified into two stages i soil evaporation mainly supported by the increased soil moisture due to surface water infiltration ii soil evaporation mainly supported by the water delivery from the deep soil layer by the capillarity during the first stage the soil water saturation at the near surface soil layer rapidly increased by water infiltration subsequently decreased to a lower value by evaporation induced water uptake and the gravity driven downward movement when the water saturation at the near surface soil layer was lower than that determined by capillarity the matric suction was expected to take up water from the deep aquifer then soil evaporation turned to the second stage the evaporation rate in the second stage was limited by capillary flow the variation of the soil moisture led to the change in the evaporation rate after the whole aquifer exposed the evaporation flux from the whole soil surface started to decrease until day 50 at which a stable evaporation flux appeared fig 5 evaporation caused water loss for the system a total of 16 8 m3 water 42 of the whole inundated water was removed by evaporation from water and soil surface in the first 100 days resulting in an obvious difference in the groundwater table at day 100 fig 3g and 3h soil evaporation continuously contributed to the recovery of the groundwater table and the enhancement of the pws the pws of the hypersaline plume increased to 79 6 ppt at day 100 and the downward expansion of the saline plume was slowed down by evaporation 23 77 m in comparison with 23 55 m at day 100 respectively for the 5 seawater fronts of the cases with and without evaporation the evaporation rate was affected by the decreased soil moisture at the near surface soil layer therefore the pws just increased from 79 6 to 89 7 ppt from day 100 to day 300 fig 3h and 3j this suggests that the increase of the pws was much faster during the first stage of soil evaporation rather than that during the second stage while the potential evaporation rate was set to 10 mm d the averaged actual evaporation rate from the whole soils was 0 34 mm d in one year the low evaporation rate was due to decreased soil evaporation with the weak upward capillary flow during the second stage to quantify the change of the pws in the shallow aquifer we calculated the vertically averaged pws in the top 1 m soil layer at day 0 the vertically averaged pws in both cases was 0 fig 6 for all the time the vertically averaged pws decreased from x 0 to x 200 m the infiltration of the overlying saltwater increased the vertically averaged pws without evaporation the vertically averaged pws at day 5 day 100 day 300 was largely overlapped fig 6a the vertically averaged pws in the top 1 m soil layer can only reach 23 8 ppt for the case without evaporation with evaporation the vertically averaged pws increased with time fig 6b different from the case without evaporation it was found that the vertically averaged pws in the seaward soils from x 0 to x 10 5 m exceeded the seawater salinity 35 ppt at day 100 and the horizontal extent of the seaward soils with the vertically averaged pws over the seawater salinity extended to 38 0 m at day 300 the vertically averaged pws reached 0 14 1 28 8 37 0 and 43 6 ppt respectively for day 0 1 5 100 and 300 fig 6b this suggests that the extent of soil salinization of the silt loam aquifer was gradually aggravated by evaporation induced freshwater uptake we further calculated the amount of salt stored in the per unit width top 1 m soil layer smts without evaporation dense saltwater continuously moved downward thus the smts increased to a peak with a salt trapping percentage of 72 1 at day 2 7 then continuously declined hereinafter the salt trapping percentage was determined as the ratio of the salt mass stored in the top 1 m soil layer to the total amount of the infiltrated salt 1435 kg a total of 312 8 kg 21 8 salt was transported to the deeper soil layer out of the top 1 m from day 2 7 to day 365 and the change of the smts was mild after day 100 fig 7 that is the strong capillarity of silt loam led to saltwater trapping in the top 1 m soil layer with evaporation the downward migration of saltwater was slightly inhibited thus a larger peak of the smts 73 8 was reached fig 7 to maintain evaporation capillarity delivered water from the deep soil layer to the shallow soil layer resulting in upward transport of salt the results showed that the smts started to increase again at day 53 5 from day 53 5 to day 365 salt was transported back to the top 1 m soil layer and salt trapping percentage increased from 62 7 to 72 7 evaporation increased a salt trapping percentage by 22 3 at day 365 in comparison with the case without evaporation note that evaporation could increase the pore water salinity in the near surface soil layer and thus enhance the upward density gradient this enhanced upward density gradient is expected to increase the downward movement of salt however for the silt loam aquifer the capillarity is relatively strong that can maintain a high soil evaporation the evaporation could induce upward pore water flow and salt movement geng et al 2016 which can cancel out the downward salt movement caused by the density gradient fig 7 3 2 sensitivity analysis on soil types we examined soil salinization in clay loam fig 8 and sandy loam fig 9 aquifers subjected to the same ocean surge inundation and compared the results with those for silt loam aquifers soil salinization in clay loam aquifers k s 7 22 10 7 m s α 1 9 m 1 and n 1 31 was overall similar to that in silt loam aquifers evaporation induced the high pws in the shallow aquifer particularly in the seaward areas fig 8 however clay loam is with a smaller hydraulic conductivity and stronger capillarity in this way the surface water infiltration took 4 9 and 4 3 d respectively for the case without and with evaporation these time durations were higher than that for silt loam 2 8 and 2 6 d the salinity distributions for the two cases without and with evaporation in clay loam aquifers were similar with those in silt loam aquifers fig 3 and fig 8 for the case without evaporation the pws in the clay loam aquifer decreased to the same value as that in the silt loam aquifer 26 9 ppt at day 300 for the case with evaporation the longer infiltration process for the clay loam aquifer prolonged water surface evaporation and led to a higher water salinity this resulted in a larger pws at day 5 75 7 ppt versus 57 2 ppt however the increment of the pws was small in the clay loam aquifer after day 5 due to the slower transport of saltwater 83 9 versus 79 6 ppt at day 100 91 8 versus 89 7 ppt at day 300 the expansion of salt plumes in the clay loam aquifer was inhibited for both cases without evaporation and with evaporation fig 3 and fig 8 and the 5 seawater fronts were shallower 23 53 versus 23 28 m 23 90 versus 23 63 m at day 300 the variations of the smts for the two clay loam cases were also similar with the silt loam cases fig 10 a the time of reaching peaks at day 5 2 for the smts was delayed in the clay loam cases and the peaks were slightly lower than the results for the silt loam cases for the clay loam case without evaporation more saltwater was trapped in the top 1 m soil layer at day 365 for the higher water retention capacity of clay loam 53 4 versus 50 4 respectively for the cases of clay loam and silt loam with evaporation more salt was transported upward back to the top 1 m soil layer from day 47 9 in comparison with the case of silt loam 10 2 versus 10 0 the smts at day 365 accounted for 74 9 of the infiltrated salt in the clay loam case with evaporation in contrast sandy loam is with a larger hydraulic conductivity and weaker capillarity k s 1 23 10 5 m s α 7 5 m 1 and n 1 89 it is expected to behave oppositely in comparison with clay loam the surface water rapidly entered the aquifer in 0 3 day the salinity distributions in the sandy loam aquifers were obviously different from the results for silt loam the expansion of saline plumes was relatively fast in comparison with the silt loam cases fig 9 the infiltrated saltwater started to influence the groundwater table of seaward soils at day 5 fig 9e because the saltwater transport was faster in sandy loam aquifers the groundwater table rapidly recovered the groundwater table from x 0 to x 200 m was monotonically increased at both day 100 and day 300 fig 9g and 9i different from the results for silt loam the 5 seawater front reached 22 19 m at day 300 for the case without evaporation much lower than that of silt loam 23 28 m similar to the silt loam case without evaporation the pws in the shallow soil layer continuously decreased 26 2 ppt at day 300 for the sandy loam case without evaporation with evaporation the expansion of saline plumes in the sandy loam aquifer was slightly inhibited 22 21 versus 22 19 m at day 300 which was similar to the results for the silt loam and clay loam cases although evaporation was considered at the near surface soil layer it was found that the change of groundwater tables was similar to the case without evaporation fig 9 as all the ponded saltwater entered the aquifer in the first day pore water started to be evaporated at seaward soils and the pws in the shallow soil layer was increased by soil evaporation the pws reached 40 4 ppt at day 1 in the sandy loam case larger than the cases of silt loam 37 4 ppt and clay loam 36 9 ppt however the evaporation influence on the pws at day 5 day 100 and day 300 was not obvious the pws decreased to 32 1 26 8 and 26 1 ppt respectively most of saltwater can migrate into the deep soil layer of the sandy loam aquifer due to the weaker capillarity the water saturation at the soil surface can be decreased to approximately 0 2 for the sandy loam aquifer fig 2b and evaporation was not allowed in the presently considered evaporation model when the soil water saturation was lower than 0 4 fig 2a therefore the effect of evaporation on the smts was not obvious in the sandy loam aquifer the results of the smts for the case with evaporation nearly overlapped with the case without evaporation the curves increased sharply and then decreased continuously fig 10b the peaks at day 0 4 of the smts were 1029 9 kg 71 8 and 1020 4 kg 71 1 respectively for the sandy loam cases without and with evaporation at day 365 the salt trapping percentage for the smts was only approximately 22 in both cases 3 3 sensitivity analysis on mean sea levels three cases with different mean sea levels case 2 h s 22 m case 7 h s 21 5 m case 8 h s 21 m were examined in this section silt loam was considered and the landward groundwater table was fixed at 23 m with the reduced mean sea level the thickness of the unsaturated zone was larger leading to the lower relative hydraulic conductivity at the soil surface the water volume entering the soils by infiltration was decreased in the case with a lower mean sea level at the same elapsed time therefore the elevation of surface water was affected the elevations were both 25 22 m at day 1 for h s 21 21 5 m slightly greater than 25 21 m for h s 22 m the surface water salinities 37 4 ppt at day 1 in the two cases h s 21 and 21 5 m were similar to the case with h s 22 m the salinity distributions in the shallow soil layer for the cases of different mean sea levels were similar fig 11 the hypersaline plumes were formed close to the soil surface and the pws progressively increased in the two cases affected by evaporation the expansion of saline plumes was similar for the three cases for h s 22 m the 5 seawater fronts were 24 14 23 77 and 23 63 m at day 5 100 and 300 for h s 21 5 m the 5 seawater fronts were 24 19 23 78 and 23 68 m at day 5 100 and 300 for h s 21 m the 5 seawater fronts were 24 21 23 78 and 23 66 m at day 5 100 and 300 the pws reached 79 9 and 79 0 ppt at day 100 respectively for h s 21 and 21 5 m however the pws slightly decreased at day 300 for the two cases 79 2 and 78 2 ppt respectively for h s 21 and 21 5 m different from the case of h s 22 m 79 6 ppt at day 100 and 89 7 ppt at day 300 the phenomenon can be explained through analyzing the variation of the smts fig 12 the quicker downward movement of saltwater led to a slightly smaller peak of the smts for the case with a higher mean sea level 75 5 74 6 and 73 8 respectively for h s 21 21 5 and 22 m the results showed that the smts in the two cases h s 21 and 21 5 m gradually declined after the peak which was different from the smts in the case of h s 22 m it was caused by the weak capillarity and the decreased soil evaporation in the two cases i e a higher mean sea level would favor evaporation induced salt trapping salt trapping percentages at day 365 were 61 6 and 61 2 for h s 21 and 21 5 m respectively fig 12 much lower than that for h s 22 m 4 discussions the previous studies suggested that an aquifer could recovery after ocean surge inundation chui and terry 2013 gingerich et al 2017 holding and allen 2015a mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 yu et al 2016 they predominately considered high permeability soils with weak capillarity capacity in fact this condition is commonly found for beach aquifers worldwide for most of coastal areas for agriculture soils with low permeability and strong capillarity capacity are typical e g silt loam and clay loam mcleod et al 2010 our results suggested that for the silt loam and clay loam aquifers more than half of the infiltrated salt remained in the top 1 m soil layer 365 days after an ocean surge inundation event salt was trapped by the strong capillarity related to the two soil types the salt trapping was not remarkable for sandy loam in which the capillarity was weak this suggests that silt loam and clay loam aquifers are hard to recovery after ocean surge inundation for a large portion of coastal areas groundwater tables are shallow this would prolong the soil salinization process as suggested by our sensitivity analysis on mean sea levels as evaporation takes up freshwater but leave salt behind it increases the salinity of both ponded surface water and pore water in the shallow soil layer in this way the pore water salinity in the shallow soil layer could be higher than the flooded seawater our results showed that the variation of salt stored in the shallow soil layer was non monotonic it demonstrated a peak after surge inundation and then decreased without evaporation whereas with evaporation it increased back this suggests that the evaporation took back the infiltrated saltwater from the deep to shallow aquifer the increased salt stored in the shallow soil layer was caused by evaporation induced water uptake and upward capillary flow our results also showed that capillary flow inhibited soil evaporation at low soil moisture contents consistent with the results in lehmann et al 2018 the process of soil salinization was prolonged and hypersaline plumes were developed the remarkably increased pore water salinity caused by evaporation is expected to change soil conditions resulting in the variation of the inhabitation environment for creatures and the succession of plant communities sea level rise is found to increase ocean surges more frequently storlazzi et al 2015 the combined effect of sea level rise and ocean surges can increase the inundation risk of inland areas mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2017 the results from chui and terry 2013 suggested that the influence of ocean surge inundation on groundwater salinization of aquifers can be reduced with sea level rise in comparison with that without sea level rise in contrast our results indicated that the high mean sea level can intensify evaporation and further aggravate the extent of soil salinization our study was limited by the fixed volume of ocean surge inundation in reality sea level rise would enhance the volume of overtopping seawater therefore evaporation induced salt accumulation in coastal aquifers would be much more pronounced the removal of salt in coastal soils with low hydraulic conductivity is very slow in natural systems mcleod et al 2010 constructing subsurface drainage systems is an appropriate method to shorten the remediation of salinization caused by ocean surge inundation elsayed and oumeraci 2018 in an aquifer equipped with subsurface drainage systems saltwater discharges through subsurface drains enhancing the lateral salt transport the groundwater table would be lowered with subsurface drainage systems based on our results the lowered groundwater table would enhance the downward seawater movement from ocean surge inundation but inhibit the upward water delivery by capillarity in this way the salt accumulation in the shallow soil layer would be relieved 5 conclusions we have examined the effect of evaporation on soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation based on our results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 evaporation can aggravate soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation due to evaporation from water and soil surface the pore water salinity at the near surface soil layer can be remarkably increased particularly in the low elevation area with longer seawater inundation 2 evaporation induced water uptake in combination with strong capillarity e g for silt loam and clay loam weakens the downward movement of salt in the shallow soil layer salt can be significantly trapped in the unsaturated zone significantly reducing the recovery capacity of the aquifer 3 mean sea levels alter the salt transport and salinity distributions in the shallow soil layer with a higher mean sea level the evaporation impact on soil salinization is more remarkable for the aquifer it is worth noting that our simulation results were based on homogenous and isotropic aquifers rainfall infiltration would also affect soil salinization in coastal areas via flushing we considered evaporation but excluded plant transpiration while the two processes behave similarly in most of hydrological systems the latter is more complex affected by meteorological conditions soil conditions and plants and important in farmlands while these aquifer properties and forcing factors remain to be investigated this study has revealed the importance of evaporation which should be considered in the future studies on soil

4618,ocean surge inundation occurs frequently in low lying coastal areas worldwide while studies have been conducted to examine aquifer salinization and recovery caused by ocean surge inundation evaporation is predominantly overlooked based on numerical simulations considering variably saturated density dependent pore water flow and salt transport this study examines the combined effects of evaporation and ocean surge inundation on soil salinization in coastal unconfined aquifers the results show that evaporation enhances soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation due to evaporation induced water uptake the downward movement of salt is weakened and the salt from the ocean surge inundation is significantly trapped in the unsaturated zone the pore water salinity in the shallow soil layer is increased by soil evaporation particularly in the low elevation area with longer seawater inundation the sensitive analysis shows that the evaporation enhanced soil salinization is more remarkable for silt loam and clay loam aquifers rather than sandy loam aquifers a higher mean sea level favors salt trapping in the shallow soil layer of aquifers these results demonstrate the importance of evaporation on soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation and that could be considered in future studies keywords soil salinization evaporation ocean surge aquifer numerical simulation 1 introduction soil salinization is a global issue threatening vegetation and crops resulting in ecosystem degradation and challenging global food security fao 2020 in densely populated and low lying coastal areas soil salinization is mainly caused by seawater intrusion lateral movement of coastal seawater into freshwater aquifers ataie ashtiani et al 2013 ferguson and gleeson 2012 michael et al 2013 werner et al 2013 and ocean surge inundation coastal flooding due to anomalous sea level height associated with low pressure weather systems gingerich et al 2017 illangasekare et al 2006 violette et al 2009 yu et al 2016 due to global climate change sea level rise is accelerated and ocean storm surges become frequent along the global coastline hoffman et al 2010 lowe and gregory 2005 marcos et al 2011 storlazzi et al 2015 ipcc 2013 the combination of the two would cause seawater to overtop coastal dykes and flood inland areas fig 1 in general ocean surge inundation has three stages i with the approach of an intense cyclone the sea level height increases and surges move towards the onshore aquifer fig 1a ii surges run up and seawater overtops the crest of the coastal dyke fig 1b iii seawater inundates low elevation areas and infiltrates into coastal soils resulting in soil salinization fig 1c ocean surge inundation causes dense saltwater to overlie light freshwater thus developing saline plumes liu and tokunaga 2019 xiao et al 2019 inundation seriously threatens freshwater storage in low lying areas through salt contamination chui and terry 2013 gingerich et al 2017 holding and allen 2015a 2015b ocean surge inundation vertically infiltrates an aquifer causing soil salinization rapidly which is different from soil salinization caused by other factors e g mineral weathering man made salinization of irrigation long term impacts to freshwater can be caused by vertical infiltration of only a small amount of seawater yang et al 2013 the field investigation

and terry 2012 shallow soils with high permeability allow more saltwater to get through during seawater inundation facilitating salt transport into an aquifer giambastiani et al 2017 when ocean surge inundation occurs an thicker unsaturated zone can collect a larger amount of saltwater holding and allen 2015b moreover yu et al 2016 demonstrated that coastal topographic features e g dykes ponds dunes and channels are important for controlling seawater infiltration and groundwater salinization by affecting runoff process and infiltration time the results from a field investigation showed that depressions become an continuing source of salt contamination to an aquifer after ocean storm surges terry and falkland 2010 the recovery time for an aquifer with high permeability is relatively short in comparison with that with low permeability holding and allen 2015b yang et al 2018 geological heterogeneity also affect the recovery of aquifer salinization holding and allen 2015b mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 vithanage et al 2012 mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 found that aquifer heterogeneity would reduce the volume of intruding saltwater in an ocean surge inundation event in comparison with a homogenous aquifer vithanage et al 2012 conducted laboratory experiments and showed that a layered configuration can greatly change migration paths of saline plumes and also the recovery time of the aquifer while these previous studies have advanced our understanding of soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation evaporation is predominantly overlooked evaporation is a vital hydrological factor affecting water circulation and balance in almost all water systems it is well established that evaporation can remove freshwater from soils but leave salt behind inducing soil salinization paine 2003 the salt accumulation caused by evaporation can also change density dependent groundwater flow shen et al 2018 wang et al 2007 xin et al 2017 geng et al 2016 found that the pore water salinity in beach intertidal zone is much higher than seawater salinity due to evaporation the evaporation rate depends on soil types and local groundwater depths geng and boufadel 2017 najib et al 2016 trabelsi et al 2012 despite the possible importance combined effects of evaporation and ocean surge inundation on soil salinization remain unclear to fill this research gap we investigated numerically the soil salinization process in unconfined aquifers after ocean surge inundation three commonly encountered soil types were considered to examine pore water flow and salinity distributions subjected to evaporation the results help to address the following key research questions 1 how does evaporation change the water exchange between inundating seawater and the aquifer after ocean surge inundation 2 how does evaporation affect salinity distributions in the shallow soil layer 3 how does evaporation influence change with soil types and mean sea levels 2 conceptual model and numerical simulations in this study a vertical cross section of a coastal unconfined aquifer was considered the configuration is given in fig 1d the aquifer was assumed to be hydraulically homogeneous and isotropic a dyke was located at the seaward boundary ad the slope of soil surface cd was set to 0 002 i e mild slope the dyke was allowed to pond the overtopping seawater caused by ocean surges to focus on soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation and evaporation rainfall infiltration was excluded in this study therefore the ponded seawater can infiltrate into the aquifer and be evaporated from both the water and soil surface fig 1d the aquifer was assumed to be laterally bounded by the mean sea level and the landward groundwater table boundaries ad and bc respectively the aquifer bottom ab was set to be an impermeable base as widely adopted previously bittelli et al 2008 geng and boufadel 2015 shen et al 2018 xin et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 a soil evaporation model based on a bulk aerodynamic approach was adopted as follows 1 e ρ a min 1 1 8 φ s ss φ s ss 0 3 0 622 p v p a 0 378 p v q a 94 909 u w 0 9036 2 p v 0 6108 e 17 27 t s t s 237 3 where

respectively p v and p a are the saturated vapor pressure m l 1 t 2 and the atmospheric pressure at the soil surface m l 1 t 2 respectively u w is the wind speed l t 1 t s is the temperature at the soil surface c in this study we set parameters as ρ a 1 205 kg m3 q a 0 0072 t s 15 c p a 101 kpa u w 3 m s φ 0 45 these settings give a potential evaporation rate i e water surface evaporation at 10 mm d fig 2 a which is commonly encountered in coastal areas sperna weiland et al 2012 for the ponded surface water upward evaporation i e 10 mm d and downward infiltration were considered the variations of surface water level and salinity were calculated by the following equations based on the principle of mass balance 3 v f v t v i v e 4 m f m t ρ f v i ρ w v e 5 m s m st m si 6 m si ρ f v i c s 7 ρ f m f v f 8 c s m s m f where v t is the total volume of ocean surge inundation v f and m f represent the volume l 3 and mass m of the ponded surface water respectively m t and m st are the water and salt mass of ocean surge inundation respectively m v i and v e are the water loss due to infiltration and evaporation respectively l 3 note that the two are determined by the groundwater model and the evaporation model respectively m s and m si are the salt mass of the ponded surface water and the infiltrated water respectively m ρ f is the density of the ponded surface water m l 3 and ρ w is the density of freshwater m l 3 c s is the salinity of the ponded surface water the initial density 1025 kg m3 and salinity 35 ppt of the ponded surface water were assigned to be the same of seawater it is worth noting that we considered evaporation that takes up freshwater only the density and salinity of the ponded surface water are expected to increase due to evaporation this is different from the previous studies excluding evaporation chui and terry 2013 holding and allen 2015b yang et al 2018 yu et al 2016 the variably saturated density dependent pore water flow and salt transport in the aquifer was simulated using sutra voss and provost 2010 the governing equations are given as follows 9 ρ φ s w t ρ q ρ f q 10 q k ψ p ρ g z 11 φ s w ρ c t ρ q c φ s w ρ d c ρ f q c s where q is the darcy velocity l t 1 and k ψ is the relative hydraulic conductivity l t 1 depending on the pore water pressure head ψ l q is the fluid sink t 1 caused by soil evaporation s w is the

respectively d is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor l 2 t 1 ρ is the pore water density m l 3 and ρ f is the density of the fluid sink m l 3 the pore water density was assumed to be linearly associated with the salinity ρ ρ 0 ξ c where ρ 0 is the freshwater density m l 3 and ξ is a constant value equaling to 714 3 kg m3 k ψ and s w are approximated using the van genuchten 1980 formulas as

water saturation α l 1 and n are water retention parameters in the model boundary ab was set to a no flow boundary the landward boundary bc and seaward boundary ad were assigned to fixed head boundaries the surface of the aquifer cd was set as the time variant boundary for those nodes submerged by the surface water the pressure was specified according to the thickness of the overlying surface water satisfying hydrostatic pressure distribution for those nodes exposed no overlying surface water the boundary condition was two fold if the previously calculated pore water pressure was larger than zero seepage face was allowed to develop and the associated pressure was set to zero otherwise the nodes were specified as a flux boundary with soil evaporation dependent on soil water saturation at the soil surface for the section with the submerged nodes and seepage face water surface evaporation was considered the evaporation flux was coupled into the model via the sink in sutra salt was retained in soils through the solute source when water was evaporated xin et al 2017 the surface water was coupled into the groundwater model by setting up the specified head boundary we calculated the total volume of infiltrated surface water influx calculated by sutra through the boundary nodes boundary cd at each time step then the volume of ponded saltwater and the surface water elevation were determined based on water mass balance until the ponded water disappeared using eqs 3 and 4 the surface water was assumed to be well mixed and with a uniform salinity since evaporation took up freshwater but left salt behind the salinity of ponded saltwater was accumulated based on salt mass balance eq 5 eight simulation cases were conducted with three common soil types in coastal areas silt loam clay loam and sandy loam considered details are given in table 1 the cases with evaporation were compared with those without evaporation for all the three soil types cases 1 6 parameter values for the selected soil types table 1 were referred from carsel and parrish 1988 the soil water retention curves are presented in fig 2b the landward groundwater table elevation h f was set to 23 0 m water salinity set to 0 ppt the mean sea level h s was set to 22 0 m for cases 1 6 water salinity set to 35 ppt focusing on silt loam we also conducted two additional simulations with increased mean sea levels the results help to understand the impact of sea level rise in all the simulations the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were set to 0 5 m and 0 05 m respectively hunt et al 2011 the molecular diffusivity was set to 10 9 m2 s voss and provost 2010 the modelled aquifer was discretized into 65 400 elements 66 110 nodes the horizontal mesh size was uniform 1 3 m the vertical mesh was refined for the top 6 m soil layer with a mesh size of 0 005 m for all the simulations the model was initially run to the steady state pressure and salinity unchanged with the specified seaward and landward water levels then an inundation event was introduced and the elevation of the surface water level was set to 25 4 m note that the whole aquifer was initially inundated i e the per unit width volume of the overlying seawater were 40 m3 then the model was run for 1 year with a time step of 120 s 3 results in this section we first focus on silt loam and discuss the salinization process caused by ocean surge inundation section 3 1 then effects of soil types and mean sea levels on soil salinization are discussed respectively in section 3 2 and section 3 3 it should be noted that the denser seawater laterally intruded into the lower aquifer resulting in a saltwater wedge as illustrated in fig 1d this saltwater wedge is expected to be altered by ocean surge inundation mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 as well established by previous studies mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 yang et al 2018 the lateral movement of the saltwater wedge in the deep aquifer is insensitive to ocean surge inundation therefore we focused on pore water flow and salinity distributions in the shallow aquifer note that saltwater wedges developed in deep aquifers are not demonstrated due to the layouts of figures given later 3 1 effect of evaporation on soil salinization process initially the pore water salinity pws in the shallow soil layer was 0 and the groundwater table was controlled by landward and seaward boundaries increasing from x 0 to 200 m fig 3 a as expected the overlying seawater caused by ocean surge inundation infiltrated into the silt loam aquifer k s 1 23 10 6 m s α 2 0 m 1 and n 1 41 of which the shallow soil layer was initially unsaturated fig 3 as a result saline plumes developed and expanded in the aquifer without and with the consideration of evaporation fig 3 without evaporation the salinity of surface water remained unchanged 35 ppt during the period of infiltration fig 4 e at day 1 the elevation of surface water decreased to 25 22 m fig 4b approximately 70 of surface water infiltrated into the aquifer in the first day fig 4a as the seaward soils were with lower elevations the surface water kept entering the soils whereas water infiltration had stopped for the landward area the saline plume became thicker at the seaward fig 3c consistent with the impact of surface depressions discussed by holding and allen 2015a the pws in the shallow soil layer reached the seawater salinity 35 ppt due to infiltration of the ponded seawater the infiltration process of the ponded surface water lasted for 2 8 d without evaporation the variation of the water volume became mild after day 1 resulting from the smaller infiltration rate with the decreased surface water soil interface fig 4a and 4d the saline plume expanded downward in the unsaturated zone continuously fig 3 the pws was reduced to 31 1 ppt at day 5 due to the downward migration of saltwater driven by gravity and the density gradient to quantify the expansion of the saline plume we averaged the elevations of the 5 seawater isohaline along the x direction hereinafter termed as 5 seawater front it was found that from day 1 to day 5 the 5 seawater front moved from 24 60 to 24 08 m the ponded saltwater recharged the groundwater and raised the groundwater table the effect of inundation on the groundwater table was found to be prolonged for silt loam the recovery of the groundwater table was slow the results demonstrated a convex shape of the groundwater table with the peak elevation 23 20 m appeared at x 90 3 m at day 100 fig 3g in this way the unsaturated zone contracted and that could inhibit the downward expansion of the saline flume the 5 seawater front lowered by 0 53 m from day 5 to day 100 similar to that from day 1 to day 5 the expansion of the saline plume gradually slowed down with only 0 27 m downward migration for the 5 seawater front from day 100 to day 300 fig 3g and 3i the groundwater table did not change obviously at day 300 in comparison with that at day 100 suggesting that groundwater flow in the silt loam aquifer was slow without evaporation saltwater in the shallow soil layer was gradually mixed with fresh groundwater and the pws decreased to 26 9 ppt at day 300 with evaporation the time taken for the surface water infiltration decreased by 0 2 d in comparison with the case without evaporation i e the water from ocean surge inundation entered the aquifer with less time the volume 11 41 versus 12 41 m3 at day 1 and the elevation 25 21 versus 25 22 m at day 1 of the surface water decreased quicker in comparison with the case without evaporation fig 4a and 4b the infiltration process was regulated by evaporation from the water surface the flux of evaporation varied from 2 00 to 1 06 m3 d during the first day fig 4c removing a total of 1 46 m3 surface water concurrently the volume of infiltrating water decreased by 0 46 m3 in comparison with the case without evaporation the salinity of surface water increased due to evaporation the salinity of surface water increased to 37 4 ppt at day 1 and the pws in the shallow soil layer slightly exceeded the seawater salinity 35 ppt it was found that the salinity of surface water increased significantly during the end of infiltration after day 2 fig 4e this led to the significantly increased pws at the seaward soils the pws reached 57 2 ppt at day 5 different from the case without evaporation the pore water can be evaporated from coastal soils without overlying water this contributed to the changed salinity distribution a hypersaline plume was developing due to both evaporation from water and soil surface fig 3f evaporation from soils can be classified into two stages i soil evaporation mainly supported by the increased soil moisture due to surface water infiltration ii soil evaporation mainly supported by the water delivery from the deep soil layer by the capillarity during the first stage the soil water saturation at the near surface soil layer rapidly increased by water infiltration subsequently decreased to a lower value by evaporation induced water uptake and the gravity driven downward movement when the water saturation at the near surface soil layer was lower than that determined by capillarity the matric suction was expected to take up water from the deep aquifer then soil evaporation turned to the second stage the evaporation rate in the second stage was limited by capillary flow the variation of the soil moisture led to the change in the evaporation rate after the whole aquifer exposed the evaporation flux from the whole soil surface started to decrease until day 50 at which a stable evaporation flux appeared fig 5 evaporation caused water loss for the system a total of 16 8 m3 water 42 of the whole inundated water was removed by evaporation from water and soil surface in the first 100 days resulting in an obvious difference in the groundwater table at day 100 fig 3g and 3h soil evaporation continuously contributed to the recovery of the groundwater table and the enhancement of the pws the pws of the hypersaline plume increased to 79 6 ppt at day 100 and the downward expansion of the saline plume was slowed down by evaporation 23 77 m in comparison with 23 55 m at day 100 respectively for the 5 seawater fronts of the cases with and without evaporation the evaporation rate was affected by the decreased soil moisture at the near surface soil layer therefore the pws just increased from 79 6 to 89 7 ppt from day 100 to day 300 fig 3h and 3j this suggests that the increase of the pws was much faster during the first stage of soil evaporation rather than that during the second stage while the potential evaporation rate was set to 10 mm d the averaged actual evaporation rate from the whole soils was 0 34 mm d in one year the low evaporation rate was due to decreased soil evaporation with the weak upward capillary flow during the second stage to quantify the change of the pws in the shallow aquifer we calculated the vertically averaged pws in the top 1 m soil layer at day 0 the vertically averaged pws in both cases was 0 fig 6 for all the time the vertically averaged pws decreased from x 0 to x 200 m the infiltration of the overlying saltwater increased the vertically averaged pws without evaporation the vertically averaged pws at day 5 day 100 day 300 was largely overlapped fig 6a the vertically averaged pws in the top 1 m soil layer can only reach 23 8 ppt for the case without evaporation with evaporation the vertically averaged pws increased with time fig 6b different from the case without evaporation it was found that the vertically averaged pws in the seaward soils from x 0 to x 10 5 m exceeded the seawater salinity 35 ppt at day 100 and the horizontal extent of the seaward soils with the vertically averaged pws over the seawater salinity extended to 38 0 m at day 300 the vertically averaged pws reached 0 14 1 28 8 37 0 and 43 6 ppt respectively for day 0 1 5 100 and 300 fig 6b this suggests that the extent of soil salinization of the silt loam aquifer was gradually aggravated by evaporation induced freshwater uptake we further calculated the amount of salt stored in the per unit width top 1 m soil layer smts without evaporation dense saltwater continuously moved downward thus the smts increased to a peak with a salt trapping percentage of 72 1 at day 2 7 then continuously declined hereinafter the salt trapping percentage was determined as the ratio of the salt mass stored in the top 1 m soil layer to the total amount of the infiltrated salt 1435 kg a total of 312 8 kg 21 8 salt was transported to the deeper soil layer out of the top 1 m from day 2 7 to day 365 and the change of the smts was mild after day 100 fig 7 that is the strong capillarity of silt loam led to saltwater trapping in the top 1 m soil layer with evaporation the downward migration of saltwater was slightly inhibited thus a larger peak of the smts 73 8 was reached fig 7 to maintain evaporation capillarity delivered water from the deep soil layer to the shallow soil layer resulting in upward transport of salt the results showed that the smts started to increase again at day 53 5 from day 53 5 to day 365 salt was transported back to the top 1 m soil layer and salt trapping percentage increased from 62 7 to 72 7 evaporation increased a salt trapping percentage by 22 3 at day 365 in comparison with the case without evaporation note that evaporation could increase the pore water salinity in the near surface soil layer and thus enhance the upward density gradient this enhanced upward density gradient is expected to increase the downward movement of salt however for the silt loam aquifer the capillarity is relatively strong that can maintain a high soil evaporation the evaporation could induce upward pore water flow and salt movement geng et al 2016 which can cancel out the downward salt movement caused by the density gradient fig 7 3 2 sensitivity analysis on soil types we examined soil salinization in clay loam fig 8 and sandy loam fig 9 aquifers subjected to the same ocean surge inundation and compared the results with those for silt loam aquifers soil salinization in clay loam aquifers k s 7 22 10 7 m s α 1 9 m 1 and n 1 31 was overall similar to that in silt loam aquifers evaporation induced the high pws in the shallow aquifer particularly in the seaward areas fig 8 however clay loam is with a smaller hydraulic conductivity and stronger capillarity in this way the surface water infiltration took 4 9 and 4 3 d respectively for the case without and with evaporation these time durations were higher than that for silt loam 2 8 and 2 6 d the salinity distributions for the two cases without and with evaporation in clay loam aquifers were similar with those in silt loam aquifers fig 3 and fig 8 for the case without evaporation the pws in the clay loam aquifer decreased to the same value as that in the silt loam aquifer 26 9 ppt at day 300 for the case with evaporation the longer infiltration process for the clay loam aquifer prolonged water surface evaporation and led to a higher water salinity this resulted in a larger pws at day 5 75 7 ppt versus 57 2 ppt however the increment of the pws was small in the clay loam aquifer after day 5 due to the slower transport of saltwater 83 9 versus 79 6 ppt at day 100 91 8 versus 89 7 ppt at day 300 the expansion of salt plumes in the clay loam aquifer was inhibited for both cases without evaporation and with evaporation fig 3 and fig 8 and the 5 seawater fronts were shallower 23 53 versus 23 28 m 23 90 versus 23 63 m at day 300 the variations of the smts for the two clay loam cases were also similar with the silt loam cases fig 10 a the time of reaching peaks at day 5 2 for the smts was delayed in the clay loam cases and the peaks were slightly lower than the results for the silt loam cases for the clay loam case without evaporation more saltwater was trapped in the top 1 m soil layer at day 365 for the higher water retention capacity of clay loam 53 4 versus 50 4 respectively for the cases of clay loam and silt loam with evaporation more salt was transported upward back to the top 1 m soil layer from day 47 9 in comparison with the case of silt loam 10 2 versus 10 0 the smts at day 365 accounted for 74 9 of the infiltrated salt in the clay loam case with evaporation in contrast sandy loam is with a larger hydraulic conductivity and weaker capillarity k s 1 23 10 5 m s α 7 5 m 1 and n 1 89 it is expected to behave oppositely in comparison with clay loam the surface water rapidly entered the aquifer in 0 3 day the salinity distributions in the sandy loam aquifers were obviously different from the results for silt loam the expansion of saline plumes was relatively fast in comparison with the silt loam cases fig 9 the infiltrated saltwater started to influence the groundwater table of seaward soils at day 5 fig 9e because the saltwater transport was faster in sandy loam aquifers the groundwater table rapidly recovered the groundwater table from x 0 to x 200 m was monotonically increased at both day 100 and day 300 fig 9g and 9i different from the results for silt loam the 5 seawater front reached 22 19 m at day 300 for the case without evaporation much lower than that of silt loam 23 28 m similar to the silt loam case without evaporation the pws in the shallow soil layer continuously decreased 26 2 ppt at day 300 for the sandy loam case without evaporation with evaporation the expansion of saline plumes in the sandy loam aquifer was slightly inhibited 22 21 versus 22 19 m at day 300 which was similar to the results for the silt loam and clay loam cases although evaporation was considered at the near surface soil layer it was found that the change of groundwater tables was similar to the case without evaporation fig 9 as all the ponded saltwater entered the aquifer in the first day pore water started to be evaporated at seaward soils and the pws in the shallow soil layer was increased by soil evaporation the pws reached 40 4 ppt at day 1 in the sandy loam case larger than the cases of silt loam 37 4 ppt and clay loam 36 9 ppt however the evaporation influence on the pws at day 5 day 100 and day 300 was not obvious the pws decreased to 32 1 26 8 and 26 1 ppt respectively most of saltwater can migrate into the deep soil layer of the sandy loam aquifer due to the weaker capillarity the water saturation at the soil surface can be decreased to approximately 0 2 for the sandy loam aquifer fig 2b and evaporation was not allowed in the presently considered evaporation model when the soil water saturation was lower than 0 4 fig 2a therefore the effect of evaporation on the smts was not obvious in the sandy loam aquifer the results of the smts for the case with evaporation nearly overlapped with the case without evaporation the curves increased sharply and then decreased continuously fig 10b the peaks at day 0 4 of the smts were 1029 9 kg 71 8 and 1020 4 kg 71 1 respectively for the sandy loam cases without and with evaporation at day 365 the salt trapping percentage for the smts was only approximately 22 in both cases 3 3 sensitivity analysis on mean sea levels three cases with different mean sea levels case 2 h s 22 m case 7 h s 21 5 m case 8 h s 21 m were examined in this section silt loam was considered and the landward groundwater table was fixed at 23 m with the reduced mean sea level the thickness of the unsaturated zone was larger leading to the lower relative hydraulic conductivity at the soil surface the water volume entering the soils by infiltration was decreased in the case with a lower mean sea level at the same elapsed time therefore the elevation of surface water was affected the elevations were both 25 22 m at day 1 for h s 21 21 5 m slightly greater than 25 21 m for h s 22 m the surface water salinities 37 4 ppt at day 1 in the two cases h s 21 and 21 5 m were similar to the case with h s 22 m the salinity distributions in the shallow soil layer for the cases of different mean sea levels were similar fig 11 the hypersaline plumes were formed close to the soil surface and the pws progressively increased in the two cases affected by evaporation the expansion of saline plumes was similar for the three cases for h s 22 m the 5 seawater fronts were 24 14 23 77 and 23 63 m at day 5 100 and 300 for h s 21 5 m the 5 seawater fronts were 24 19 23 78 and 23 68 m at day 5 100 and 300 for h s 21 m the 5 seawater fronts were 24 21 23 78 and 23 66 m at day 5 100 and 300 the pws reached 79 9 and 79 0 ppt at day 100 respectively for h s 21 and 21 5 m however the pws slightly decreased at day 300 for the two cases 79 2 and 78 2 ppt respectively for h s 21 and 21 5 m different from the case of h s 22 m 79 6 ppt at day 100 and 89 7 ppt at day 300 the phenomenon can be explained through analyzing the variation of the smts fig 12 the quicker downward movement of saltwater led to a slightly smaller peak of the smts for the case with a higher mean sea level 75 5 74 6 and 73 8 respectively for h s 21 21 5 and 22 m the results showed that the smts in the two cases h s 21 and 21 5 m gradually declined after the peak which was different from the smts in the case of h s 22 m it was caused by the weak capillarity and the decreased soil evaporation in the two cases i e a higher mean sea level would favor evaporation induced salt trapping salt trapping percentages at day 365 were 61 6 and 61 2 for h s 21 and 21 5 m respectively fig 12 much lower than that for h s 22 m 4 discussions the previous studies suggested that an aquifer could recovery after ocean surge inundation chui and terry 2013 gingerich et al 2017 holding and allen 2015a mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 yu et al 2016 they predominately considered high permeability soils with weak capillarity capacity in fact this condition is commonly found for beach aquifers worldwide for most of coastal areas for agriculture soils with low permeability and strong capillarity capacity are typical e g silt loam and clay loam mcleod et al 2010 our results suggested that for the silt loam and clay loam aquifers more than half of the infiltrated salt remained in the top 1 m soil layer 365 days after an ocean surge inundation event salt was trapped by the strong capillarity related to the two soil types the salt trapping was not remarkable for sandy loam in which the capillarity was weak this suggests that silt loam and clay loam aquifers are hard to recovery after ocean surge inundation for a large portion of coastal areas groundwater tables are shallow this would prolong the soil salinization process as suggested by our sensitivity analysis on mean sea levels as evaporation takes up freshwater but leave salt behind it increases the salinity of both ponded surface water and pore water in the shallow soil layer in this way the pore water salinity in the shallow soil layer could be higher than the flooded seawater our results showed that the variation of salt stored in the shallow soil layer was non monotonic it demonstrated a peak after surge inundation and then decreased without evaporation whereas with evaporation it increased back this suggests that the evaporation took back the infiltrated saltwater from the deep to shallow aquifer the increased salt stored in the shallow soil layer was caused by evaporation induced water uptake and upward capillary flow our results also showed that capillary flow inhibited soil evaporation at low soil moisture contents consistent with the results in lehmann et al 2018 the process of soil salinization was prolonged and hypersaline plumes were developed the remarkably increased pore water salinity caused by evaporation is expected to change soil conditions resulting in the variation of the inhabitation environment for creatures and the succession of plant communities sea level rise is found to increase ocean surges more frequently storlazzi et al 2015 the combined effect of sea level rise and ocean surges can increase the inundation risk of inland areas mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2017 the results from chui and terry 2013 suggested that the influence of ocean surge inundation on groundwater salinization of aquifers can be reduced with sea level rise in comparison with that without sea level rise in contrast our results indicated that the high mean sea level can intensify evaporation and further aggravate the extent of soil salinization our study was limited by the fixed volume of ocean surge inundation in reality sea level rise would enhance the volume of overtopping seawater therefore evaporation induced salt accumulation in coastal aquifers would be much more pronounced the removal of salt in coastal soils with low hydraulic conductivity is very slow in natural systems mcleod et al 2010 constructing subsurface drainage systems is an appropriate method to shorten the remediation of salinization caused by ocean surge inundation elsayed and oumeraci 2018 in an aquifer equipped with subsurface drainage systems saltwater discharges through subsurface drains enhancing the lateral salt transport the groundwater table would be lowered with subsurface drainage systems based on our results the lowered groundwater table would enhance the downward seawater movement from ocean surge inundation but inhibit the upward water delivery by capillarity in this way the salt accumulation in the shallow soil layer would be relieved 5 conclusions we have examined the effect of evaporation on soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation based on our results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 evaporation can aggravate soil salinization caused by ocean surge inundation due to evaporation from water and soil surface the pore water salinity at the near surface soil layer can be remarkably increased particularly in the low elevation area with longer seawater inundation 2 evaporation induced water uptake in combination with strong capillarity e g for silt loam and clay loam weakens the downward movement of salt in the shallow soil layer salt can be significantly trapped in the unsaturated zone significantly reducing the recovery capacity of the aquifer 3 mean sea levels alter the salt transport and salinity distributions in the shallow soil layer with a higher mean sea level the evaporation impact on soil salinization is more remarkable for the aquifer it is worth noting that our simulation results were based on homogenous and isotropic aquifers rainfall infiltration would also affect soil salinization in coastal areas via flushing we considered evaporation but excluded plant transpiration while the two processes behave similarly in most of hydrological systems the latter is more complex affected by meteorological conditions soil conditions and plants and important in farmlands while these aquifer properties and forcing factors remain to be investigated this study has revealed the importance of evaporation which should be considered in the future studies on soil

4619,as an inland groundwater fed oasis in northwest china the dunhuang west lake wetland dwlw has been threatened by decreasing groundwater recharge over the past several decades understanding recharging processes for dwlw is a key step for better protection of the oasis but poorly studied to this end we carried out a comprehensive water chemistry and isotope sampling and analysis by taking the oasis and its water sources as a complete system to reveal the oasis water recharging mechanism and flow paths water samples including mountain snowmelt water river water groundwater spring and lake water were collected within and around the dwlw and their environmental isotopes δ18o and δd and water chemistry were analysed results showed that the stable isotope values exhibited strong spatial variations ranging from 90 69 to 42 45 for δd and from 13 81 to 2 90 for δ18o the isotope values were extremely depleted for snowmelt water followed by river water groundwater spring water and were most enriched in lake water the difference in isotopic values from the different water bodies indicates that seasonal rivers primarily originate from the snowmelt water in the adjacent mountains discharge into the aquifer through infiltration then groundwater rises up by forms of springs to the lake oases the river and groundwater interacted frequently causing significant changes in solute in different positions the ion concentrations accumulated continuously along the flow path the total dissolved solid content varied from 416 mg l in river water to 20360 mg l in lake water and the dominant anion facies changed systematically from h c o 3 to s o 4 2 then c l the ionic ration plot chlor alkali index and saturation index demonstrated that dissolution of minerals plays a major role in the change in chemical composition and other processes such as carbonate precipitation associated with cation exchange reaction also influence the chemical composition our results are helpful for understanding the hydrological and hydrochemical processes in arid groundwater fed oases and can be also useful for rational management and assessment of regional scale groundwater resources in oases keywords recharge source hydrogeochemical evolution river groundwater spring lake system groundwater fed oasis dunhuang west lake wetland 1 introduction in desert areas with rare precipitation and limited surface water the oasis ecosystem is highly dependent on groundwater including portions of groundwater transformed from surface water huang et al 2020 min et al 2020 wang et al 2019 in recent years significant declines in groundwater levels induced by human activities have dramatically triggered a series of eco environmental problems in the arid northwest china including land desertification wetland shrinkage spring depletion vegetation degradation etc muyibul et al 2018 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 therefore it is of great practical significance to detect water supply paths of oases and the interaction among different water bodies which play a significant role for a protection approach and maintaining the ecological stability of many important oases in the arid northwest china hydrogeochemical and isotope studies coupled with some conventional analysis methods in the past few decades have been routinely applied to identify surface and groundwater replenishment sources and flow paths bhat and jeelani 2015 shamsi et al 2019 recent investigations have been gradually expanded stable isotope analyses from atmospheric precipitation to river lake

et al 2019 noble and ansari 2019 ogrinc et al 2018 sun et al 2016b the chemical characteristics of the water system can record information on the sources of chemical component and the interactions of multiple water bodies in the hydrological cycle guo et al 2019 by exploring the composition and distribution of anions and cations in different water bodies the generation and evolution processes of water bodies can be determined qualitatively or even quantitatively bajjali et al 1997 chandrajith et al 2013 hydrological and isotopic features of water in the arid and semiarid oases in northwest china have been extensively studied in recent years huang and pang 2010 wang et al 2016 2013 yang et al 2011 however most studies have focused on surface water fed oases and few studies have focused on groundwater fed oases as a typical groundwater fed oasis the dunhuang west lake wetland dwlw is located at the western part of the hexi corridor northwest china the dwlw is the natural barrier to prevent the kumtag desert from invading the hexi corridor and plays a decisive role in securing the sustainable development of dunhuang city and the protection of mogao grottoes a world cultural heritage site over the past half century some springs formed oases have gradually diminished or disappeared in the dwlw ma et al 2015 the groundwater dependent ecosystem has been threatened by declining water tables in this area huang and pang 2010 which will increase the ecosystem vulnerability of surrounding deserts dwlw is located in arid inland area with extreme dry climate and most rivers dry up before reaching the oasis it is unfeasible to monitor direct recharge sources and flow paths from the ground in the meantime systematic hydrochemical and isotopic datasets of the oasis system are scarce making the oasis replenishment processes unclear although there are some studies on the groundwater recharge sources by isotopic tracing methods in dunhuang basin ma et al 2013 sun et al 2016b wang et al 2015 the persuasiveness of the results remains to be discussed without considering replenishment sources and the oases as a single system therefore the replenishment sources and their flow paths and the links between groundwater and rivers that originate from the surrounding mountains qilian mountains and altun mountains are still unclear it is highly required to distinguish the replenishment sources flow paths and changes along the processes by using systematic data and methods and to generate an oasis restoration plan for this fragile arid area thus the objectives of this study are to i identify the chemical and isotopic composition of multiphase water bodies including snowmelt water river water groundwater spring water and lake water and reveal the supply drainage relationship among them ii delineate flow paths and understand the recharge characteristics and contributions of various recharge sources in different oases and iii propose a conceptual model of hydrological and hydrochemical evolution process for oasis water replenishment system a combination of stable isotopes hydrogeochemical and hydrogeological data was used to delineate replenishment sources flow paths and hydrogeochemical evolution the results of this study will provide clear knowledge of the dwlw recharge mechanisms and the hydraulic connection among multiphase water bodies and will also benefit the rational evaluation of regional scale hydrochemical evolution in groundwater fed oases especially for regions with declining groundwater resources 2 study area 2 1 general setting dunhuang west lake national nature reserve dwlr is located at the western end of the hexi corridor of gansu province china and extends between latitudes of 39 45 40 36 n and longitudes of 92 45 93 50 e fig 1 it lies between the north foot of the altun mountains the east edge of the kumtag desert the end of the shule river and south of the beishan with a total area of 6600 km2 duan et al 2015 the dwlr was established in 2003 to protect a set of oases formed by ascending spring or descending spring as oases have been gradually degraded since the 1980s this region is characterized by an extreme continental climate that is extremely hot in the summer and severely cold in the winter the mean annual temperature is approximately 9 3 c with a mean temperature of 23 9 c in summer and a mean temperature of 6 2 c in winter according to observational data from 1955 to 2018 at the dunhuang national meteorological station the annual mean precipitation is only 39 9 mm and the annual potential evapotranspiration is approximately 2400 mm lin et al 2018 with the highest monthly potential evapotranspiration recorded in july the oasis in dwlr assembly named the dwlw in the paper followings is one of the largest wetlands in the arid regions of northwest china and even the central asian plateau covering an area of 980 km2 sun et al 2016a and accounting for 15 of the total area of dwlr there are a set of oases including wanyao tianqiaodun mamitu and huoshao lake as marked in fig 1 and the dwlw is composed of water surface formed by spring overflow and vegetation around the water body the predominant vegetation species are tamarix chinensis populus euphratica nitraria sphaerocarpa and alhagi sparsifolia mainly depending on groundwater for sustenance cui et al 2014 huangdun farm which reflects the hydro geochemical evolution and groundwater recharge condition in dunhuang city is a representative artificial oasis in dunhuang irrigation district in recent decades groundwater over extraction in dunhuang city has caused a decline of regional groundwater table resulting in land desertification wetland shrinkage and spring water depletion thus creating a highly visible indicator of ecological deterioration and desertification in the dwlr ma et al 2015 four oasis subzones were divided based on the hydrogeological conditions in this paper as showed in fig 1 oasis 1 included the wanyao tianqiaodun and mamitu in the core region of the dwlw oasis 2 represented the huoshao lake at the edge of the dwlw oasis 3 primarily comprised the nanquan wetland and oasis 4 represented the huangdun farm 2 2 hydrogeological setting the dwlr and surrounding areas are located to the east of the tarim plate which consists of the south tianshan structural belt the beishan structural belt and the altun structural belt the impermeable basement rocks of the study area consist of conglomerate argillaceous siltstone and mudstone that formed during the tertiary system and these materials were cemented by calcareous mud with relatively close structure sang et al 2007 large volumes of quaternary sediments were deposited in the foreland depression in the dwlr the sediments of the study area are rich in evaporate minerals such as halite sylvite and sodium sulfate sun et al 2016b the main aquifers that overlie this basement material are composed of alluvial and proluvial sediments carried into the area by the danghe river the shule river and some small seasonal rivers and there are lacustrine deposits in some low lying areas fig 2 which are good storage places for groundwater resources ma et al 2013 the groundwater system of dunhuang basin exhibits typical hydrogeology characteristics of the alluvial plain the south of the basin is a single phreatic aquifer with thicknesses between 200 and 400 m and it gradually transits northward into a double layer or multi layer structure of phreatic aquifer 20 m and confined aquifer 30 50 m the overall groundwater generally flows from the se to nw and then discharges in the kumtag desert the dwlr is isolated by the gobi desert chen et al 2015 and the main water resources are provided by two sources of subsurface flow one is the underflow replenishment of multiple seasonal rivers such as duoba cuimutu xitu and shanshui which are recharged by precipitation and melting snow of the eastern altun mountains forming a total runoff of approximately 40 million m3 ma et al 2013 the other source is groundwater recharge formed by surface infiltration of the danghe and shule rivers duan et al 2015 the danghe river originates in the qilian mountains which is located south of the study area and is replenished by glacier meltwater snow springs and precipitation and the meltwater accounts for approximately 39 8 of the total runoff ma et al 2013 the mainstream of the shule river originates from the qilian mountains and the shule river only flows temporarily at the upper reaches and dries out in the middle reaches over the year sun et al 2016b however with the completion and operation of the shule river and danghe river channel restoration and realignment project in 2017 surface runoff reappeared in the lower reaches correspondingly halaqi the terminal lake of shule river also recovered its water storage gradually and reached water surface area of 5 km2 in 2019 3 methods and materials 3 1 sampling a total of 70 sets of water samples were collected at 50 locations in 2019 with 41 samples in may and 29 samples in september in the dwlr and surrounding areas the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 river water samples were collected directly from rivers including danghe river duoba river cuimutu river xitu river shanshui river and shule river that flow towards to dwlw groundwater samples were taken from the groundwater monitoring wells with depth less than 30 m as well as shallow wells drilled with a hand auger to depths between 1 and 8 m across the dwlw in addition lake water was sampled from 0 3 m below the water surface and all spring water samples were taken near the spring outlet to minimize the groundwater exposure to ambient air and evaporation the samples for isotope δ18o and δd and hydrochemical analysis were collected in two 20 ml glass bottles and two 500 ml polyethylene bottles respectively and stored at 4 c fridge after sealed with parafilm all sampling bottles were rinsed three times and filled up with sampling water and then tightly capped all samples were immediately transported to the laboratory for further analysis 3 2 data processing water temperature t ph value and total dissolved solids tds were measured in situ by a multiparameter instrument horiba u 50 horiba advanced techno co ltd japan with an accuracy of 0 1 for ph and 0 5 for tds reading limits the stable isotopes δ18o and δd of water samples were determined using a liquid h o isotope mass spectrometer finnigan mat 253 thermo fisher united states manufactured in bremen germany at the centre laboratory for physical and chemical analysis institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences the δ18o and δd values were measured relative to internal standards that were calibrated using iaea standards using equilibration with co2 he for δ18o and h he for δd both results were expressed in δ with respect to the vienna standard mean ocean water standard vsmow to eliminate the memory effect from previous samples each measurement was repeated five times and only the last three measurements were retained the measurement accuracy of δd and δ18o was 1 and 0 1 2 stdv respectively major ions of water samples n a k c a 2 m g 2 c l h c o 3 n o 3 and s o 4 2 were analysed using standard methods at gansu geological engineering laboratory within a week of sampling the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm millipore membrane filter first the filtrate was acidified with ultra pure nitric acid to a ph value around 2 and then the cations n a k c a 2 m g 2 were measured using an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer icap 7400 thermo fisher united states c l n o 3 and s o 4 2 anions were measured using an ion chromatograph ic 8628 qingdao luhai photoelectric technology co ltd china and h c o 3 and c o 3 2 were analysed by titration 0 01 n h2so4 the ionic charge balance error was less than 5 for water samples the results are shown in table 1 3 3 analytical methods 3 3 1 isosource model stable isotopes δ18o and δd are considered to be appropriate tracers for determining the groundwater origin and are extensively used to study the circulation of natural water bodies kong et al 2018 given that δ18o could be expected to behave relatively conservatively the isosource model developed by the phillips team was used to determine the composition and proportion of different springs from possible sources zhang et al 2014 this method needs to satisfy the isotopic mass conservation qiu et al

indices si are used to predict the reactive mineralogy of the subsurface from groundwater data without collecting the samples of the solid phase and analysing the mineralogy rajmohan and elango 2004 to evaluate the extent to which surface water and groundwater in the dwlw and surrounding areas could dissolve or precipitate minerals the si is calculated using the chemical data of water samples and phreeqc software as follows ghobadi et al 2018 5 si log iap k where iap is the ion activity product of the reaction and k represents the equilibrium constant at the sample temperature when si 0 water is equilibrium with respect to a particular mineral if si 0 water is supersaturated and exhibits a tendency to precipitate the minerals if si 0 water is undersaturated and more minerals can be dissolved in water coetsiers and walraevens 2006 according to the observed chemical data and si values reverse simulation can determine the water rock reaction mechanism by calculating the amount of minerals and gases that might be dissolved or precipitated which cause the difference between the initial and final solutions along the flow direction in inverse modelling at least two groups of ion

evaluate the geochemical evolution and chemical reactions reverse simulation of water samples from the study area was calculated using phreeqc manoj et al 2019 4 results 4 1 hydrochemical characteristics the spatial variations of physical parameters ph and tds in the dwlr and surrounding areas are shown in fig 3 according to the hydrogeological settings and flow directions the water samples were divided into two groups for analysis there are 13 sampling sites no 1 no 13 in the recharge zone and 37 sampling sites no 14 no 50 in the discharge zone the river water in the recharge zone was weakly alkaline with a mean ph value of 8 17 0 22 sd that are typical of carbonate system water generally the ph exhibited a decreasing trend along river flow paths the average ph value of the water samples in the discharge zone varied from 7 27 to 8 63 with a mean value of 7 86 0 41 sd tds values of river water samples varied from 416 to 948 mg l with a mean value of 734 198 sd mg l in the recharge zone however a gradual increase is noted along the groundwater flow path high tds values were found in the mouth of spring varied from 2337 to 5856 mg l reaching the brackish level table 2 indicates that the relative abundance of major cations following an order of n a m g 2 c a 2 k based on meq l correspondingly the order of major anions is s o 4 2 o r c l h c o 3 n o 3 the piper diagram shows distinguishable hydrochemical features among two zones as observed in fig 4 in the recharge zone except for a few samples showing mixed cations na is the dominant cation comprising 40 5 to 58 6 of the total cations m g 2 and c a 2 were secondary dominating cations in different water samples in the discharge zone the major hydrochemical type differs based on location the groundwater samples fall into the so4 cl na type in the oasis 1 whereas the water samples in the end of shule river were classified as cl so4 na and the groundwater showed variable hydrochemical types including hco3 cl na hco3 so4 cl na and cl hco3 so4 na in oasis 3 the highest concentrations of both c l and s o 4 2 were observed in the discharge zone ranging from 13 59 to 60 97 meq l and 11 54 to 43 13 meq l respectively the water samples with wide ranges of solute concentrations in the study area indicate that the groundwater had undergone different hydrological and hydrogeochemical processes 4 2 characteristics of stable isotopes the δd and δ18o values of water samples exhibit notable spatial heterogeneity varying from 90 69 to 42 45 for δd and 13 81 to 2 90 for δ18o respectively table 1 the δd and δ18o values of water samples of the study area were relatively enriched in may and depleted in september due to the higher temperature and intensive evaporation in may the pattern shows a gradual enrichment in δd concentrations from seasonal river water mean 77 0 6 30 to groundwater mean 74 87 5 45 to spring water mean 72 74 8 82 and with a notable peak at the lake water mean 50 5 5 98 according to the isotopic values of different locations and different water types we artificially divided δd values into four categories fig 5 a 90 69 δd 85 00 for river water predominantly located around altun mountains and in the upper reaches of cuimutu river where there are good recharge and circulation condition 84 99 δd 75 00 mainly for seasonal river water in the recharge zone and groundwater in the oases 74 99 δd 65 00 mainly for spring water distributed in the oasis 1 and 64 99 δd 42 45 which mainly represents river water in the lower reaches of the shule river with saline water 5 discussions 5 1 groundwater origins and mixing ratios of different sources generally precipitation is one of the main sources of surface water and groundwater once precipitation reaches the ground surface it may remain on the surface to form surface water or infiltrate into the aquifer to form groundwater in other words given the evaporation enrichment effect in the water flow process if surface water or groundwater comes from precipitation the isotope composition of the precipitation should be the lightest but the fact is reverse fig 6 showed that the weighted average isotopic values of precipitation in dunhuang basin 6 3 for δ18o and 42 for δd observed by sun et al 2016b were higher than those of other water samples in oases indicating that local precipitation is not the main recharge source of oases this conclusion has been endorsed by several previous investigation that the groundwater recharge from local precipitation is less than 1 mm year in arid areas of western chinese he et al 2012 ma et al 2010 wang et al 2016 2015 the qilian lmwl δd 7 80δ18o 16 87 r2 0 95 which was provided by wu et al 2016 represents the isotopic characteristics of precipitation in the qilian mountains as shown in fig 6 seasonal river samples are distributed to the left of the global meteoric water line gmwl and some scatters of seasonal river samples fall exactly on the qilian lmwl demonstrating that the recharge water originated from the cold high altitude inland areas therefore snow and ice melt water from the altun mountains and qilian mountains might be the primary recharge source of river water based on the δ18o and δd values of water samples in the oases we derived an equation of the groundwater evaporation line gwel in fig 6 the intersection point values of gwel and qilian station lmwl were 13 51 88 49 in may and 14 94 99 66 in september respectively the δ18o value of gwel lmwl intersection point could indicate the initial non fractionated isotopic content value of recharge source in order to reveal the mean altitude of the recharge area we use the precipitation δ18o altitude relationship line δ18o 0 0024alt 5 39 alt elevation m derived from the precipitation samples δ18o values and their corresponding altitudes in 15 typical sites of northwest china as shown in fig 7 applying this relationship line and the δ18o value of the cross point between gwle and lmwm we obtained the average altitude of the recharge area of approximately 3383 m in may and 3979 m in september respectively according to the mass conservation principle the contribution ratios of oases from possible recharge sources can be determined by isotopic signatures using the isosource model table 3 based on the delineation of direct recharge sources and the isosource model the oasis 1 is mainly replenished by subsurface flow from seasonal rivers originated from altun mountain danghe river and shule river contributing 74 5 2 6 and 22 9 in may and 60 4 21 3 and 18 3 in september respectively in any case seasonal rivers are the main recharge sources of the oasis 1 oasis 2 is mainly derived from seasonal river and danghe river contributing 56 7 and 43 3 in may respectively the corresponding proportions of seasonal river and danghe river into oasis 2 in september are calculated to be 87 1 and 12 9 which indicate that the underground flow from seasonal rivers is significant in this area the δ18o and δd values in oasis 3 are relatively depleted than adjacent rivers suggesting that part of groundwater is supplied directly by the snow and ice melt water through subsurface flow there is a discrepancy between the contribution ratios of river recharge during different months the direct supply from altun mountains only accounts for 2 4 of the total recharge in may whereas the remaining 97 6 corresponds to seasonal river and danghe river in september recharge contributions of influent water from the seasonal river and danghe river are about 14 2 and 15 1 respectively and altun mountains recharge water accounts for the remaining 70 6 altun mountains begin to melt ice and snow in spring the direct subsurface flow could recharge oasis 3 within a short time so the contribution ratio of river recharge was high in may meanwhile the low flow of seasonal rivers in september which decreased the replenishment ratio of river recharge correspondingly 5 2 major ions indicating groundwater constituent sources in general the major sources of dissolved salts in surface water and groundwater include input from precipitation weathering of rocks regional geologic and anthropogenic input yuan et al 2020 evidenced by gibbs diagrams in fig 8 water samples are clustered in the evaporation dominance and rock dominance zones supporting the notion that rock weathering i e water rock interaction and evaporation crystallization in the dwlr and surrounding areas is the key mechanism in the evolution of water chemical composition water rock interaction is the major factor control the chemical evolution of groundwater in order to distinguish the type of weathered rocks the ion concentration ratios were used hagedorn and whittier 2015 stoichiometric relation among major ions can reveal the possible reactive minerals the concentrations of major ions indicating groundwater constituent sources were statistically analysed fig 9 if n a comes from the dissolution of halite then n a c l will be closed to 1 significantly linear correlations were observed between n a vs c l with correlation coefficients of 0 91 implying halite dissolution as the principal control of n a and c l contents along the groundwater flow path however almost all water samples are above the 1 1 isometric line of n a c l fig 9 a explaining the additional sources of n a from silicate weathering mirabilite dissolution or other anthropogenic input ibe and ebe 2000 in terms of the n a and s o 4 2 relationship the positive correlation between n a vs s o 4 2 0 94 fig 9 d provides robust evidence that n a concentrations partially originated from sodium sulfate furthermore the source of c a 2 and s o 4 2 provided by gypsum and anhydrite dissolution are confirmed because of the strong correlation between c a 2 and s o 4 2 0 82 fig 9 e the equivalent ratio of dissolved s o 4 2 n a and s o 4 2 c a 2 would be 1 2 for mirabilite dissolution and 1 1 for gypsum dissolution respectively the points of the s o 4 2 n a and s o 4 2 c a 2 rations are almost all below the isometric line showing the existence of gypsum dissolution process accompanied with the mirabilite dissolution in the aquifer fig 9 e the stoichiometric relationships between c a 2 m g 2 vs s o 4 2 h c o 3 reflect the contribution of carbonate rock sand sulfate minerals dissolution or precipitation to groundwater chemical compositions dogramaci et al 2012 yang et al 2018 most samples are plotted close to the 1 1 line with the low ion concentration fig 9 g the points gradually deviate as the ion concentration deviates indicating that as the c a 2 m g 2 concentration increases the dissolution advantages of calcite dolomite are replaced by another mineral that is rich in s o 4 2 or h c o 3 the c a 2 and m g 2 contents were excessive compared with the h c o 3 concentrations in most water samples fig 9 f suggesting that relatively small amounts of c a 2 and m g 2 derived from mineral weathering by co2 while large amounts were originated from dissolution of gypsum and magnesium sulfates in addition most water samples had m g 2 c a 2 ratios of 1 fig 9 h suggesting that the aquifer is rich in high magnesium sulfates the explanation has been manifested from evidence downtrend lines of c a 2 m g 2 s o 4 2 h c o 3 vs n a k c l fig 9 i exhibiting the characteristics of mirabilite dissolution which causes the concentration of n a in groundwater to increase continuously and might contribute to the occurrence of cation exchange the cai is positively correlated with tds and nearly all values of cai are greater than 0 thus implying a direct cation exchange occurs between n a and k from water and c a 2 and m g 2 of the rocks fig 10 a as a result the dissolved concentrations of c a 2 and m g 2 increase in the groundwater the c a 2 n a values of the rivers in the recharge zone are mostly between 0 4 and 1 62 and the c a 2 n a values of the spring and groundwater in the discharge zone are all less than 0 5 fig 10 b this finding demonstrates that silicate mineral reactions or cation exchange in groundwater results in the loss of some cations in brief the c a 2 n a ratio decreases along the path of groundwater flow and it can be further demonstrated that some points in the gibbs diagram appear outside the dotted box due to the cation exchange effect 5 3 hydrogeochemical evolution processes during flow paths according to the field survey performed by the gansu geology survey 1978 the soils of this area are rich in evaporite minerals such as halite sylvite gypsum and mirabilite survey 1978 the main formation minerals in the study area are carbonate rock and silicate rock the above ion analysis also shows that mirabilite gypsum and halite minerals affect the main solute components in groundwater table 4 presents the mineral saturation states for water samples with the exception of a few carbonate types calcite and dolomite in the water samples other minerals are found in an unsaturated state in general the si values are as follows carbonate sulfate chloride the na2so4 minerals mirabilite and thenardite were unsaturated in all water samples and the si values in the discharge zone are increased compared with that in the recharge zone indicating the continuous dissolution of na2so4 minerals along the way groundwater was far below saturation with chloride minerals including halite and sylvite as showed by the negative si values ranging between 4 4 and 7 7 which confirms that the soluble component n a c l and k concentration was not limited by mineral equilibrium in the sediments of the study area table 5 showed the inverse modelling results using phreeqc software ding et al 2017 yang et al 2018 which were used to understand the hydrogeochemical evolution processes during flow paths of the groundwater from the recharge zone to the discharge zone based on mineral si result c a 2 n a ratio and the geological condition of the study area the hydrogeochemical processes mainly included the dissolution of dolomite mirabilite gypsum and halite and the precipitation of calcite epsomite and sylvite from the recharge zone to the discharge zone 5 4 conceptual model of recharge source and hydrogeochemical evolution in the dwlw and surrounding areas the isotope distribution of river water groundwater and spring water appear obvious seasonal and spatial variations reflecting the recharge discharge relationship and the characteristics of the regional hydrologic cycle in the recharge zone frequent interactions occur between river water and groundwater primarily recharge groundwater in the form of infiltration groundwater flow downward along the elevation under the influence of gravity and overflow in the form of spring in low lying areas hao et al 2019 numerous seasonal lakes emerge around the spring thus forming the oases in the discharge zone based on the isotopic and hydrogeochemical analyses a conceptual model of recharge source and hydrogeochemical evolution was developed to understand groundwater circulation in the dwlw and surrounding areas fig 11 in the recharge zone the snow and ice melt water from the altun mountains and qilian mountains is the primary recharge source of groundwater due to the low temperature of snow water and the weak evaporation the values of δd and δ18o in the recharge zone are relatively low groundwater with a low velocity could efficiently dissolve the evaporites during vertical recharge and migration processes liu et al 2018 along the regional groundwater flow path from south to north mineral dissolution and cation exchange are the essential factors controlling hydrogeochemical evolution process in west lake wetland fig 11 a similar to most arid regions of the world wang et al 2015 2013 ion chemistry accumulates continuously along the flow path and the dominant anion phase changes systematically from h c o 3 to s o 4 2 to c l the nanquan wetland is located at the leading edge of the danghe alluvial fan with a shallow groundwater table depth fig 11 b and isotopic signature suggests the existence of recharge from snow and ice melt water fresh groundwater in the nanquan wetland might have undergone less evaporation due to rapid recharge through danghe alluvial fan thus leading to low salinity with an average tds of 909 mg l confirming the results of xing et al 2016 the main anions there are consistent with the replenishment zone and the anion concentration is h c o 3 s o 4 2 c l in descending order the danghe river is regulated by danghe reservoir and intercepted for irrigation which might reduce the river leakage to aquifers in the danghe alluvial fan fig 11 c groundwater was overexploited by local inhabitants to meet domestic and agricultural demand along the way which naturally made irrigation return flow through vertical infiltration a major recharge source the isotopic and hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater in huangdun farm are similar with that of danghe river with relatively low tds value of 699 mg l long distance surface evaporation was the dominant process controlling water evolution with salinity levels of approximately 20 360 mg l at the end of shule river the halite dissolution causes the major ions to be n a and c l compared with the entire study area the δd and δ18o are most enriched in this zone with the average values s d of 48 53 2 03 and 5 51 0 79 respectively 6 conclusions the recharge sources and hydrogeochemical evolution processes in groundwater fed oases of arid northwest china were investigated with a comprehensive analysis of the isotopic and hydrogeochemical characteristics of different water bodies the oasis water replenishment system is characterized by a unique cascade recharging system from snowmelt water to seasonal rivers groundwater spring outflow and lake wetlands the δd and δ18o values tended to be enriched along the overall flow path from the southeast to the northwest with minimum values in snow and river water medium values in groundwater and spring water and maximum values in lake water generally tds cl and major ion concentrations gradually increase due to prolonged evaporation and water rock interaction as a result water types evolve from ca hco3 na2so4 to nacl along the recharging route the initial recharge source was derived from snow and ice melt water of the adjacent mountains and the average recharge altitude of the mountains is approximately 3383 m in may and 3979 m in september the dwlw oases are mainly replenished by subsurface flow from the seasonal rivers danghe river and shule river and seasonal rivers are the main recharge sources for the dwlw the lack of snow water isotope sampling at different altitudes needs to be improved in the future studies this study is one of the few attempts to build a conceptual diagram of recharge sources and hydrochemical evolution in groundwater fed oasis by considering the oasis and its water sources as a whole system our results provide new insights into the hydrological and hydrochemical processes in arid groundwater fed oases and this work also provides a better systematic

4619,as an inland groundwater fed oasis in northwest china the dunhuang west lake wetland dwlw has been threatened by decreasing groundwater recharge over the past several decades understanding recharging processes for dwlw is a key step for better protection of the oasis but poorly studied to this end we carried out a comprehensive water chemistry and isotope sampling and analysis by taking the oasis and its water sources as a complete system to reveal the oasis water recharging mechanism and flow paths water samples including mountain snowmelt water river water groundwater spring and lake water were collected within and around the dwlw and their environmental isotopes δ18o and δd and water chemistry were analysed results showed that the stable isotope values exhibited strong spatial variations ranging from 90 69 to 42 45 for δd and from 13 81 to 2 90 for δ18o the isotope values were extremely depleted for snowmelt water followed by river water groundwater spring water and were most enriched in lake water the difference in isotopic values from the different water bodies indicates that seasonal rivers primarily originate from the snowmelt water in the adjacent mountains discharge into the aquifer through infiltration then groundwater rises up by forms of springs to the lake oases the river and groundwater interacted frequently causing significant changes in solute in different positions the ion concentrations accumulated continuously along the flow path the total dissolved solid content varied from 416 mg l in river water to 20360 mg l in lake water and the dominant anion facies changed systematically from h c o 3 to s o 4 2 then c l the ionic ration plot chlor alkali index and saturation index demonstrated that dissolution of minerals plays a major role in the change in chemical composition and other processes such as carbonate precipitation associated with cation exchange reaction also influence the chemical composition our results are helpful for understanding the hydrological and hydrochemical processes in arid groundwater fed oases and can be also useful for rational management and assessment of regional scale groundwater resources in oases keywords recharge source hydrogeochemical evolution river groundwater spring lake system groundwater fed oasis dunhuang west lake wetland 1 introduction in desert areas with rare precipitation and limited surface water the oasis ecosystem is highly dependent on groundwater including portions of groundwater transformed from surface water huang et al 2020 min et al 2020 wang et al 2019 in recent years significant declines in groundwater levels induced by human activities have dramatically triggered a series of eco environmental problems in the arid northwest china including land desertification wetland shrinkage spring depletion vegetation degradation etc muyibul et al 2018 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 therefore it is of great practical significance to detect water supply paths of oases and the interaction among different water bodies which play a significant role for a protection approach and maintaining the ecological stability of many important oases in the arid northwest china hydrogeochemical and isotope studies coupled with some conventional analysis methods in the past few decades have been routinely applied to identify surface and groundwater replenishment sources and flow paths bhat and jeelani 2015 shamsi et al 2019 recent investigations have been gradually expanded stable isotope analyses from atmospheric precipitation to river lake spring groundwater glacier and other multiphase water bodies and significant breakthroughs have been made in groundwater genesis the proportion of groundwater mixing water source and flow path bekele et al 2019 noble and ansari 2019 ogrinc et al 2018 sun et al 2016b the chemical characteristics of the water system can record information on the sources of chemical component and the interactions of multiple water bodies in the hydrological cycle guo et al 2019 by exploring the composition and distribution of anions and cations in different water bodies the generation and evolution processes of water bodies can be determined qualitatively or even quantitatively bajjali et al 1997 chandrajith et al 2013 hydrological and isotopic features of water in the arid and semiarid oases in northwest china have been extensively studied in recent years huang and pang 2010 wang et al 2016 2013 yang et al 2011 however most studies have focused on surface water fed oases and few studies have focused on groundwater fed oases as a typical groundwater fed oasis the dunhuang west lake wetland dwlw is located at the western part of the hexi corridor northwest china the dwlw is the natural barrier to prevent the kumtag desert from invading the hexi corridor and plays a decisive role in securing the sustainable development of dunhuang city and the protection of mogao grottoes a world cultural heritage site over the past half century some springs formed oases have gradually diminished or disappeared in the dwlw ma et al 2015 the groundwater dependent ecosystem has been threatened by declining water tables in this area huang and pang 2010 which will increase the ecosystem vulnerability of surrounding deserts dwlw is located in arid inland area with extreme dry climate and most rivers dry up before reaching the oasis it is unfeasible to monitor direct recharge sources and flow paths from the ground in the meantime systematic hydrochemical and isotopic datasets of the oasis system are scarce making the oasis replenishment processes unclear although there are some studies on the groundwater recharge sources by isotopic tracing methods in dunhuang basin ma et al 2013 sun et al 2016b wang et al 2015 the persuasiveness of the results remains to be discussed without considering replenishment sources and the oases as a single system therefore the replenishment sources and their flow paths and the links between groundwater and rivers that originate from the surrounding mountains qilian mountains and altun mountains are still unclear it is highly required to distinguish the replenishment sources flow paths and changes along the processes by using systematic data and methods and to generate an oasis restoration plan for this fragile arid area thus the objectives of this study are to i identify the chemical and isotopic composition of multiphase water bodies including snowmelt water river water groundwater spring water and lake water and reveal the supply drainage relationship among them ii delineate flow paths and understand the recharge characteristics and contributions of various recharge sources in different oases and iii propose a conceptual model of hydrological and hydrochemical evolution process for oasis water replenishment system a combination of stable isotopes hydrogeochemical and hydrogeological data was used to delineate replenishment sources flow paths and hydrogeochemical evolution the results of this study will provide clear knowledge of the dwlw recharge mechanisms and the hydraulic connection among multiphase water bodies and will also benefit the rational evaluation of regional scale hydrochemical evolution in groundwater fed oases especially for regions with declining groundwater resources 2 study area 2 1 general setting dunhuang west lake national nature reserve dwlr is located at the western end of the hexi corridor of gansu province china and extends between latitudes of 39 45 40 36 n and longitudes of 92 45 93 50 e fig 1 it lies between the north foot of the altun mountains the east edge of the kumtag desert the end of the shule river and south of the beishan with a total area of 6600 km2 duan et al 2015 the dwlr was established in 2003 to protect a set of oases formed by ascending spring or descending spring as oases have been gradually degraded since the 1980s this region is characterized by an extreme continental climate that is extremely hot in the summer and severely cold in the winter the mean annual temperature is approximately 9 3 c with a mean temperature of 23 9 c in summer and a mean temperature of 6 2 c in winter according to observational data from 1955 to 2018 at the dunhuang national meteorological station the annual mean precipitation is only 39 9 mm and the annual potential evapotranspiration is approximately 2400 mm lin et al 2018 with the highest monthly potential evapotranspiration recorded in july the oasis in dwlr assembly named the dwlw in the paper followings is one of the largest wetlands in the arid regions of northwest china and even the central asian plateau covering an area of 980 km2 sun et al 2016a and accounting for 15 of the total area of dwlr there are a set of oases including wanyao tianqiaodun mamitu and huoshao lake as marked in fig 1 and the dwlw is composed of water surface formed by spring overflow and vegetation around the water body the predominant vegetation species are tamarix chinensis populus euphratica nitraria sphaerocarpa and alhagi sparsifolia mainly depending on groundwater for sustenance cui et al 2014 huangdun farm which reflects the hydro geochemical evolution and groundwater recharge condition in dunhuang city is a representative artificial oasis in dunhuang irrigation district in recent decades groundwater over extraction in dunhuang city has caused a decline of regional groundwater table resulting in land desertification wetland shrinkage and spring water depletion thus creating a highly visible indicator of ecological deterioration and desertification in the dwlr ma et al 2015 four oasis subzones were divided based on the hydrogeological conditions in this paper as showed in fig 1 oasis 1 included the wanyao tianqiaodun and mamitu in the core region of the dwlw oasis 2 represented the huoshao lake at the edge of the dwlw oasis 3 primarily comprised the nanquan wetland and oasis 4 represented the huangdun farm 2 2 hydrogeological setting the dwlr and surrounding areas are located to the east of the tarim plate which consists of the south tianshan structural belt the beishan structural belt and the altun structural belt the impermeable basement rocks of the study area consist of conglomerate argillaceous siltstone and mudstone that formed during the tertiary system and these materials were cemented by calcareous mud with relatively close structure sang et al 2007 large volumes of quaternary sediments were deposited in the foreland depression in the dwlr the sediments of the study area are rich in evaporate minerals such as halite sylvite and sodium sulfate sun et al 2016b the main aquifers that overlie this basement material are composed of alluvial and proluvial sediments carried into the area by the danghe river the shule river and some small seasonal rivers and there are lacustrine deposits in some low lying areas fig 2 which are good storage places for groundwater resources ma et al 2013 the groundwater system of dunhuang basin exhibits typical hydrogeology characteristics of the alluvial plain the south of the basin is a single phreatic aquifer with thicknesses between 200 and 400 m and it gradually transits northward into a double layer or multi layer structure of phreatic aquifer 20 m and confined aquifer 30 50 m the overall groundwater generally flows from the se to nw and then discharges in the kumtag desert the dwlr is isolated by the gobi desert chen et al 2015 and the main water resources are provided by two sources of subsurface flow one is the underflow replenishment of multiple seasonal rivers such as duoba cuimutu xitu and shanshui which are recharged by precipitation and melting snow of the eastern altun mountains forming a total runoff of approximately 40 million m3 ma et al 2013 the other source is groundwater recharge formed by surface infiltration of the danghe and shule rivers duan et al 2015 the danghe river originates in the qilian mountains which is located south of the study area and is replenished by glacier meltwater snow springs and precipitation and the meltwater accounts for approximately 39 8 of the total runoff ma et al 2013 the mainstream of the shule river originates from the qilian mountains and the shule river only flows temporarily at the upper reaches and dries out in the middle reaches over the year sun et al 2016b however with the completion and operation of the shule river and danghe river channel restoration and realignment project in 2017 surface runoff reappeared in the lower reaches correspondingly halaqi the terminal lake of shule river also recovered its water storage gradually and reached water surface area of 5 km2 in 2019 3 methods and materials 3 1 sampling a total of 70 sets of water samples were collected at 50 locations in 2019 with 41 samples in may and 29 samples in september in the dwlr and surrounding areas the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 river water samples were collected directly from rivers including danghe river duoba river cuimutu river xitu river shanshui river and shule river that flow towards to dwlw groundwater samples were taken from the groundwater monitoring wells with depth less than 30 m as well as shallow wells drilled with a hand auger to depths between 1 and 8 m across the dwlw in addition lake water was sampled from 0 3 m below the water surface and all spring water samples were taken near the spring outlet to minimize the groundwater exposure to ambient air and evaporation the samples for isotope δ18o and δd and hydrochemical analysis were collected in two 20 ml glass bottles and two 500 ml polyethylene bottles respectively and stored at 4 c fridge after sealed with parafilm all sampling bottles were rinsed three times and filled up with sampling water and then tightly capped all samples were immediately transported to the laboratory for further analysis 3 2 data processing water temperature t ph value and total dissolved solids tds were measured in situ by a multiparameter instrument horiba u 50 horiba advanced techno co ltd japan with an accuracy of 0 1 for ph and 0 5 for tds reading limits the stable isotopes δ18o and δd of water samples were determined using a liquid h o isotope mass spectrometer finnigan mat 253 thermo fisher united states manufactured in bremen germany at the centre laboratory for physical and chemical analysis institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences the δ18o and δd values were measured relative to internal standards that were calibrated using iaea standards using equilibration with co2 he for δ18o and h he for δd both results were expressed in δ with respect to the vienna standard mean ocean water standard vsmow to eliminate the memory effect from previous samples each measurement was repeated five times and only the last three measurements were retained the measurement accuracy of δd and δ18o was 1 and 0 1 2 stdv respectively major ions of water samples n a k c a 2 m g 2 c l h c o 3 n o 3 and s o 4 2 were analysed using standard methods at gansu geological engineering laboratory within a week of sampling the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm millipore membrane filter first the filtrate was acidified with ultra pure nitric acid to a ph value around 2 and then the cations n a k c a 2 m g 2 were measured using an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer icap 7400 thermo fisher united states c l n o 3 and s o 4 2 anions were measured using an ion chromatograph ic 8628 qingdao luhai photoelectric technology co ltd china and h c o 3 and c o 3 2 were analysed by titration 0 01 n h2so4 the ionic charge balance error was less than 5 for water samples the results are shown in table 1 3 3 analytical methods 3 3 1 isosource model stable isotopes δ18o and δd are considered to be appropriate tracers for determining the groundwater origin and are extensively used to study the circulation of natural water bodies kong et al 2018 given that δ18o could be expected to behave relatively conservatively the isosource model developed by the phillips team was used to determine the composition and proportion of different springs from possible sources zhang et al 2014 this method needs to satisfy the isotopic mass conservation qiu et al 2019 1 δ 18 o f 1 δ 18 o 1 f 2 δ 18 o 2 f 3 δ 18 o 3 2 f 1 f 2 f 3 1 where f 1 f 2 f 3 f n are the mixing fraction of n water sources in the recharge zone and δ 18 o 1 δ 18 o 2 δ 18 o 3 δ 18 o n are the δ18o of n different water sources 3 3 2 chlor alkali index during the movement of groundwater clay minerals in the loose sediments of the aquifer system will adsorb certain cations which changes the groundwater chemical composition schoeller 1977 defined the chlor alkali index to study the cation exchange effect guo et al 2019 as follows 3 c a i 1 c l n a k c l 4 c a i 2 c l n a k s o 4 2 h c o 3 c o 3 2 n o 3 if n a or k in groundwater undergo cation exchange with c a 2 or m g 2 from the aquifer material cai1 and cai2 are both positive 3 3 3 mineral saturation indices mineral saturation indices si are used to predict the reactive mineralogy of the subsurface from groundwater data without collecting the samples of the solid phase and analysing the mineralogy rajmohan and elango 2004 to evaluate the extent to which surface water and groundwater in the dwlw and surrounding areas could dissolve or precipitate minerals the si is calculated using the chemical data of water samples and phreeqc software as follows ghobadi et al 2018 5 si log iap k where iap is the ion activity product of the reaction and k represents the equilibrium constant at the sample temperature when si 0 water is equilibrium with respect to a particular mineral if si 0 water is supersaturated and exhibits a tendency to precipitate the minerals if si 0 water is undersaturated and more minerals can be dissolved in water coetsiers and walraevens 2006 according to the observed chemical data and si values reverse simulation can determine the water rock reaction mechanism by calculating the amount of minerals and gases that might be dissolved or precipitated which cause the difference between the initial and final solutions along the flow direction in inverse modelling at least two groups of ion concentration values n a k c a 2 m g 2 c l h c o 3 n o 3 and s o 4 2 and one group of potential reaction substances are needed to complete the mass balance calculation along a specific flow path to evaluate the geochemical evolution and chemical reactions reverse simulation of water samples from the study area was calculated using phreeqc manoj et al 2019 4 results 4 1 hydrochemical characteristics the spatial variations of physical parameters ph and tds in the dwlr and surrounding areas are shown in fig 3 according to the hydrogeological settings and flow directions the water samples were divided into two groups for analysis there are 13 sampling sites no 1 no 13 in the recharge zone and 37 sampling sites no 14 no 50 in the discharge zone the river water in the recharge zone was weakly alkaline with a mean ph value of 8 17 0 22 sd that are typical of carbonate system water generally the ph exhibited a decreasing trend along river flow paths the average ph value of the water samples in the discharge zone varied from 7 27 to 8 63 with a mean value of 7 86 0 41 sd tds values of river water samples varied from 416 to 948 mg l with a mean value of 734 198 sd mg l in the recharge zone however a gradual increase is noted along the groundwater flow path high tds values were found in the mouth of spring varied from 2337 to 5856 mg l reaching the brackish level table 2 indicates that the relative abundance of major cations following an order of n a m g 2 c a 2 k based on meq l correspondingly the order of major anions is s o 4 2 o r c l h c o 3 n o 3 the piper diagram shows distinguishable hydrochemical features among two zones as observed in fig 4 in the recharge zone except for a few samples showing mixed cations na is the dominant cation comprising 40 5 to 58 6 of the total cations m g 2 and c a 2 were secondary dominating cations in different water samples in the discharge zone the major hydrochemical type differs based on location the groundwater samples fall into the so4 cl na type in the oasis 1 whereas the water samples in the end of shule river were classified as cl so4 na and the groundwater showed variable hydrochemical types including hco3 cl na hco3 so4 cl na and cl hco3 so4 na in oasis 3 the highest concentrations of both c l and s o 4 2 were observed in the discharge zone ranging from 13 59 to 60 97 meq l and 11 54 to 43 13 meq l respectively the water samples with wide ranges of solute concentrations in the study area indicate that the groundwater had undergone different hydrological and hydrogeochemical processes 4 2 characteristics of stable isotopes the δd and δ18o values of water samples exhibit notable spatial heterogeneity varying from 90 69 to 42 45 for δd and 13 81 to 2 90 for δ18o respectively table 1 the δd and δ18o values of water samples of the study area were relatively enriched in may and depleted in september due to the higher temperature and intensive evaporation in may the pattern shows a gradual enrichment in δd concentrations from seasonal river water mean 77 0 6 30 to groundwater mean 74 87 5 45 to spring water mean 72 74 8 82 and with a notable peak at the lake water mean 50 5 5 98 according to the isotopic values of different locations and different water types we artificially divided δd values into four categories fig 5 a 90 69 δd 85 00 for river water predominantly located around altun mountains and in the upper reaches of cuimutu river where there are good recharge and circulation condition 84 99 δd 75 00 mainly for seasonal river water in the recharge zone and groundwater in the oases 74 99 δd 65 00 mainly for spring water distributed in the oasis 1 and 64 99 δd 42 45 which mainly represents river water in the lower reaches of the shule river with saline water 5 discussions 5 1 groundwater origins and mixing ratios of different sources generally precipitation is one of the main sources of surface water and groundwater once precipitation reaches the ground surface it may remain on the surface to form surface water or infiltrate into the aquifer to form groundwater in other words given the evaporation enrichment effect in the water flow process if surface water or groundwater comes from precipitation the isotope composition of the precipitation should be the lightest but the fact is reverse fig 6 showed that the weighted average isotopic values of precipitation in dunhuang basin 6 3 for δ18o and 42 for δd observed by sun et al 2016b were higher than those of other water samples in oases indicating that local precipitation is not the main recharge source of oases this conclusion has been endorsed by several previous investigation that the groundwater recharge from local precipitation is less than 1 mm year in arid areas of western chinese he et al 2012 ma et al 2010 wang et al 2016 2015 the qilian lmwl δd 7 80δ18o 16 87 r2 0 95 which was provided by wu et al 2016 represents the isotopic characteristics of precipitation in the qilian mountains as shown in fig 6 seasonal river samples are distributed to the left of the global meteoric water line gmwl and some scatters of seasonal river samples fall exactly on the qilian lmwl demonstrating that the recharge water originated from the cold high altitude inland areas therefore snow and ice melt water from the altun mountains and qilian mountains might be the primary recharge source of river water based on the δ18o and δd values of water samples in the oases we derived an equation of the groundwater evaporation line gwel in fig 6 the intersection point values of gwel and qilian station lmwl were 13 51 88 49 in may and 14 94 99 66 in september respectively the δ18o value of gwel lmwl intersection point could indicate the initial non fractionated isotopic content value of recharge source in order to reveal the mean altitude of the recharge area we use the precipitation δ18o altitude relationship line δ18o 0 0024alt 5 39 alt elevation m derived from the precipitation samples δ18o values and their corresponding altitudes in 15 typical sites of northwest china as shown in fig 7 applying this relationship line and the δ18o value of the cross point between gwle and lmwm we obtained the average altitude of the recharge area of approximately 3383 m in may and 3979 m in september respectively according to the mass conservation principle the contribution ratios of oases from possible recharge sources can be determined by isotopic signatures using the isosource model table 3 based on the delineation of direct recharge sources and the isosource model the oasis 1 is mainly replenished by subsurface flow from seasonal rivers originated from altun mountain danghe river and shule river contributing 74 5 2 6 and 22 9 in may and 60 4 21 3 and 18 3 in september respectively in any case seasonal rivers are the main recharge sources of the oasis 1 oasis 2 is mainly derived from seasonal river and danghe river contributing 56 7 and 43 3 in may respectively the corresponding proportions of seasonal river and danghe river into oasis 2 in september are calculated to be 87 1 and 12 9 which indicate that the underground flow from seasonal rivers is significant in this area the δ18o and δd values in oasis 3 are relatively depleted than adjacent rivers suggesting that part of groundwater is supplied directly by the snow and ice melt water through subsurface flow there is a discrepancy between the contribution ratios of river recharge during different months the direct supply from altun mountains only accounts for 2 4 of the total recharge in may whereas the remaining 97 6 corresponds to seasonal river and danghe river in september recharge contributions of influent water from the seasonal river and danghe river are about 14 2 and 15 1 respectively and altun mountains recharge water accounts for the remaining 70 6 altun mountains begin to melt ice and snow in spring the direct subsurface flow could recharge oasis 3 within a short time so the contribution ratio of river recharge was high in may meanwhile the low flow of seasonal rivers in september which decreased the replenishment ratio of river recharge correspondingly 5 2 major ions indicating groundwater constituent sources in general the major sources of dissolved salts in surface water and groundwater include input from precipitation weathering of rocks regional geologic and anthropogenic input yuan et al 2020 evidenced by gibbs diagrams in fig 8 water samples are clustered in the evaporation dominance and rock dominance zones supporting the notion that rock weathering i e water rock interaction and evaporation crystallization in the dwlr and surrounding areas is the key mechanism in the evolution of water chemical composition water rock interaction is the major factor control the chemical evolution of groundwater in order to distinguish the type of weathered rocks the ion concentration ratios were used hagedorn and whittier 2015 stoichiometric relation among major ions can reveal the possible reactive minerals the concentrations of major ions indicating groundwater constituent sources were statistically analysed fig 9 if n a comes from the dissolution of halite then n a c l will be closed to 1 significantly linear correlations were observed between n a vs c l with correlation coefficients of 0 91 implying halite dissolution as the principal control of n a and c l contents along the groundwater flow path however almost all water samples are above the 1 1 isometric line of n a c l fig 9 a explaining the additional sources of n a from silicate weathering mirabilite dissolution or other anthropogenic input ibe and ebe 2000 in terms of the n a and s o 4 2 relationship the positive correlation between n a vs s o 4 2 0 94 fig 9 d provides robust evidence that n a concentrations partially originated from sodium sulfate furthermore the source of c a 2 and s o 4 2 provided by gypsum and anhydrite dissolution are confirmed because of the strong correlation between c a 2 and s o 4 2 0 82 fig 9 e the equivalent ratio of dissolved s o 4 2 n a and s o 4 2 c a 2 would be 1 2 for mirabilite dissolution and 1 1 for gypsum dissolution respectively the points of the s o 4 2 n a and s o 4 2 c a 2 rations are almost all below the isometric line showing the existence of gypsum dissolution process accompanied with the mirabilite dissolution in the aquifer fig 9 e the stoichiometric relationships between c a 2 m g 2 vs s o 4 2 h c o 3 reflect the contribution of carbonate rock sand sulfate minerals dissolution or precipitation to groundwater chemical compositions dogramaci et al 2012 yang et al 2018 most samples are plotted close to the 1 1 line with the low ion concentration fig 9 g the points gradually deviate as the ion concentration deviates indicating that as the c a 2 m g 2 concentration increases the dissolution advantages of calcite dolomite are replaced by another mineral that is rich in s o 4 2 or h c o 3 the c a 2 and m g 2 contents were excessive compared with the h c o 3 concentrations in most water samples fig 9 f suggesting that relatively small amounts of c a 2 and m g 2 derived from mineral weathering by co2 while large amounts were originated from dissolution of gypsum and magnesium sulfates in addition most water samples had m g 2 c a 2 ratios of 1 fig 9 h suggesting that the aquifer is rich in high magnesium sulfates the explanation has been manifested from evidence downtrend lines of c a 2 m g 2 s o 4 2 h c o 3 vs n a k c l fig 9 i exhibiting the characteristics of mirabilite dissolution which causes the concentration of n a in groundwater to increase continuously and might contribute to the occurrence of cation exchange the cai is positively correlated with tds and nearly all values of cai are greater than 0 thus implying a direct cation exchange occurs between n a and k from water and c a 2 and m g 2 of the rocks fig 10 a as a result the dissolved concentrations of c a 2 and m g 2 increase in the groundwater the c a 2 n a values of the rivers in the recharge zone are mostly between 0 4 and 1 62 and the c a 2 n a values of the spring and groundwater in the discharge zone are all less than 0 5 fig 10 b this finding demonstrates that silicate mineral reactions or cation exchange in groundwater results in the loss of some cations in brief the c a 2 n a ratio decreases along the path of groundwater flow and it can be further demonstrated that some points in the gibbs diagram appear outside the dotted box due to the cation exchange effect 5 3 hydrogeochemical evolution processes during flow paths according to the field survey performed by the gansu geology survey 1978 the soils of this area are rich in evaporite minerals such as halite sylvite gypsum and mirabilite survey 1978 the main formation minerals in the study area are carbonate rock and silicate rock the above ion analysis also shows that mirabilite gypsum and halite minerals affect the main solute components in groundwater table 4 presents the mineral saturation states for water samples with the exception of a few carbonate types calcite and dolomite in the water samples other minerals are found in an unsaturated state in general the si values are as follows carbonate sulfate chloride the na2so4 minerals mirabilite and thenardite were unsaturated in all water samples and the si values in the discharge zone are increased compared with that in the recharge zone indicating the continuous dissolution of na2so4 minerals along the way groundwater was far below saturation with chloride minerals including halite and sylvite as showed by the negative si values ranging between 4 4 and 7 7 which confirms that the soluble component n a c l and k concentration was not limited by mineral equilibrium in the sediments of the study area table 5 showed the inverse modelling results using phreeqc software ding et al 2017 yang et al 2018 which were used to understand the hydrogeochemical evolution processes during flow paths of the groundwater from the recharge zone to the discharge zone based on mineral si result c a 2 n a ratio and the geological condition of the study area the hydrogeochemical processes mainly included the dissolution of dolomite mirabilite gypsum and halite and the precipitation of calcite epsomite and sylvite from the recharge zone to the discharge zone 5 4 conceptual model of recharge source and hydrogeochemical evolution in the dwlw and surrounding areas the isotope distribution of river water groundwater and spring water appear obvious seasonal and spatial variations reflecting the recharge discharge relationship and the characteristics of the regional hydrologic cycle in the recharge zone frequent interactions occur between river water and groundwater primarily recharge groundwater in the form of infiltration groundwater flow downward along the elevation under the influence of gravity and overflow in the form of spring in low lying areas hao et al 2019 numerous seasonal lakes emerge around the spring thus forming the oases in the discharge zone based on the isotopic and hydrogeochemical analyses a conceptual model of recharge source and hydrogeochemical evolution was developed to understand groundwater circulation in the dwlw and surrounding areas fig 11 in the recharge zone the snow and ice melt water from the altun mountains and qilian mountains is the primary recharge source of groundwater due to the low temperature of snow water and the weak evaporation the values of δd and δ18o in the recharge zone are relatively low groundwater with a low velocity could efficiently dissolve the evaporites during vertical recharge and migration processes liu et al 2018 along the regional groundwater flow path from south to north mineral dissolution and cation exchange are the essential factors controlling hydrogeochemical evolution process in west lake wetland fig 11 a similar to most arid regions of the world wang et al 2015 2013 ion chemistry accumulates continuously along the flow path and the dominant anion phase changes systematically from h c o 3 to s o 4 2 to c l the nanquan wetland is located at the leading edge of the danghe alluvial fan with a shallow groundwater table depth fig 11 b and isotopic signature suggests the existence of recharge from snow and ice melt water fresh groundwater in the nanquan wetland might have undergone less evaporation due to rapid recharge through danghe alluvial fan thus leading to low salinity with an average tds of 909 mg l confirming the results of xing et al 2016 the main anions there are consistent with the replenishment zone and the anion concentration is h c o 3 s o 4 2 c l in descending order the danghe river is regulated by danghe reservoir and intercepted for irrigation which might reduce the river leakage to aquifers in the danghe alluvial fan fig 11 c groundwater was overexploited by local inhabitants to meet domestic and agricultural demand along the way which naturally made irrigation return flow through vertical infiltration a major recharge source the isotopic and hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater in huangdun farm are similar with that of danghe river with relatively low tds value of 699 mg l long distance surface evaporation was the dominant process controlling water evolution with salinity levels of approximately 20 360 mg l at the end of shule river the halite dissolution causes the major ions to be n a and c l compared with the entire study area the δd and δ18o are most enriched in this zone with the average values s d of 48 53 2 03 and 5 51 0 79 respectively 6 conclusions the recharge sources and hydrogeochemical evolution processes in groundwater fed oases of arid northwest china were investigated with a comprehensive analysis of the isotopic and hydrogeochemical characteristics of different water bodies the oasis water replenishment system is characterized by a unique cascade recharging system from snowmelt water to seasonal rivers groundwater spring outflow and lake wetlands the δd and δ18o values tended to be enriched along the overall flow path from the southeast to the northwest with minimum values in snow and river water medium values in groundwater and spring water and maximum values in lake water generally tds cl and major ion concentrations gradually increase due to prolonged evaporation and water rock interaction as a result water types evolve from ca hco3 na2so4 to nacl along the recharging route the initial recharge source was derived from snow and ice melt water of the adjacent mountains and the average recharge altitude of the mountains is approximately 3383 m in may and 3979 m in september the dwlw oases are mainly replenished by subsurface flow from the seasonal rivers danghe river and shule river and seasonal rivers are the main recharge sources for the dwlw the lack of snow water isotope sampling at different altitudes needs to be improved in the future studies this study is one of the few attempts to build a conceptual diagram of recharge sources and hydrochemical evolution in groundwater fed oasis by considering the oasis and its water sources as a whole system our results provide new insights into the hydrological and hydrochemical processes in arid groundwater fed oases and this work also provides a better systematic
