8950,ridge furrow with plastic film mulching rm has the potential to enhance crop yields and water productivity particularly in semi arid regions however the combined effects of rm and various urea types on rainfed potato solanum tuberosum l production remain unclear a three year field experiment 2018 2020 was conducted to elucidate the effects of the rm combined with various urea types on water productivity tuber yield and economic benefits in a dryland farming system treatments consisted of two mulching patterns rm and no plastic film mulching nm combined with the application of three urea types common urea u controlled release urea c and mixed c and u at a ratio of 1 1 cu our results indicated that compared to nm the rm system reduced soil evaporative losses which ultimately increased average soil water storage for the 0 60 cm soil layer by 6 7 p 0 05 in addition rm increased the mean soil temperature for the 0 10 cm soil layer by 1 4 c compared with nm these changes in soil under rm helped increase plant height leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index but reduced leaf flavonoid thereby improving tuber yield the application of cu further improved plant height leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index which allowed the exploitation of more soil water to increase tuber yield and water productivity p 0 05 the interactions of mulching and urea type had significant influence on the tuber yield water productivity and partial factor productivity of nitrogen especially with the rmcu rmcu significantly p 0 05 increased potato yield up to 23 5 water productivity 23 7 partial factor productivity of nitrogen 23 5 and economic benefit 38 4 compared to the nmu during both drought and non drought growing seasons we conclude that compared with other treatments rmcu resulted in the highest tuber yield water productivity and economic benefit across three growing seasons and should be considered an effective strategy to foster sustainable potato production in dryland farming systems keywords controlled release urea ridge furrow with plastic film mulching water productivity tuber yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drylands account for approximately 45 of the earth s land area schimel 2010 and are used for rainfed cropping by millions of farmers zhang et al 2021 dryland agriculture is becoming increasingly important to global food security due to increasing food demand by rapidly growing populations solh and van ginkel 2014 potato solanum tuberosum l is the world s fourth largest food crop q li et al 2018a 2018b qin et al 2022 thus its production is crucial for meeting the food demands worldwide liu et al 2020 nevertheless potato production in the main potato growing semi arid regions of china is frequently limited by water shortages and suboptimal field management strategies qin et al 2014 li et al 2018a 2018b chen et al 2019 adopting appropriate agronomy practices and technologies to enhance efficient rainwater collection and utilization is crucial for sustainable crop production in such dryland areas liu et al 2016 ma et al 2020 qiang et al 2022 ridge furrow with plastic film mulching rm system is a low cost micro field rainwater collecting technique that has been developed and widely applied to increase crop production in semi arid regions zhao et al 2014 mo et al 2017a a typical rm system consists of soil surface film mulching and alternating ridge furrow units zhang et al 2020 where soil surface film mulching is primarily utilized to reduce evaporative losses and increase early season soil temperatures zhao et al 2012 liu et al 2016 the ridge furrows also support rainwater collection in the planted area while mitigating surface runoff from heavy rainfall zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a 2022b one of the main attributes of the rm system is that it can improve soil hydrothermal conditions thereby promoting early and stable seedling establishment li et al 2019a 2019b which is important when irrigation is not possible and spring temperatures are low hou et al 2010 qin et al 2014 previous studies demonstrated the potential of the rm system to increase crop production hu et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 by optimizing soil hydrothermal conditions li et al 2013 liang et al 2018 and promoting soil nutrient availability zhou et al 2012 in semi arid regions zhao et al 2014 found that rm increased tuber yield and water productivity wp of potato by 57 4 78 2 and 56 8 70 3 respectively compared with traditional flat planting and without mulching this has been well documented for a number of crops including potato wang et al 2019 maize liu et al 2016 and wheat qiang et al 2022 thus the rm system can be considered critical for ensuring food security in any potato dryland farming area in the world however owing to the lack of irrigation and labor to top dress nitrogen n fertilizers farmers in the semi arid regions in china prefer to apply all n fertilizer at once before plastic film mulching sun et al 2019 qiang et al 2022 with this practice a large amount of available n quickly accumulates in the soil leading to insufficient n supply at the later growth stages thereby limiting photosynthetic efficiency and crop yields sun et al 2019 qiang et al 2022 thus it is important to ensure adequate n fertilizer supply under the rm system during all critical growth stages for potatoes one fertilization strategy is to use controlled release urea which gradually releases n into the soil solution to improve synchrony between soil n availability and crop n demand venterea et al 2011 yang et al 2017 wu et al 2021 it has been reported that controlled release urea application significantly improves n use efficiency and crop yields pack et al 2006 hyatt et al 2010 ziadi et al 2011 li et al 2018a 2018b zhao et al 2022 for example a global meta analysis by zhang et al 2019 found that controlled release urea increased maize yield by 5 3 and n use efficiency by 24 1 compared with urea same n rate yet other studies have shown that controlled release urea releases n too slowly at the early stage after application which may limit crop vegetative growth and n uptake consequently causing yield reductions and lower n use efficiency farmaha and sims 2013 chilundo et al 2016 gao et al 2018 the rate of n released from the controlled release urea is affected by soil moisture and temperature which often cannot be controlled in a field environment grant et al 2012 li et al 2020 furthermore the higher cost of controlled release urea than conventional urea limits its widespread use tang et al 2021 a few studies have been carried out to address the aforementioned issues in order to increase farmers profit margin tang et al 2019 qu et al 2020 one proposed approach is to blend controlled release urea with urea cu which helps meet crop n requirements throughout the entire growing season and the total cost is also reduced due to the decreased controlled release urea ratio zheng et al 2016 guo et al 2022b the application of cu has improved leaf n content and photosynthetic capacity guo et al 2021 and consequently has promoted crop yields payne et al 2015 garcia et al 2018 bai et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a 2022b nevertheless its use for rainfed potato has not been sufficiently studied especially under rm system combining rm with various urea types has the potential to increase nutrient and water availability in soils tang et al 2019 qiang et al 2022 and improve n concentration of leaves sun et al 2011 guo et al 2022a some studies have showed that rm and n application significantly increased leaf area and chlorophyll content compared with flat planting with non mulching li and li 2021 fang et al 2022 the leaf chlorophyll content is strongly correlated to crop n status sun et al 2011 li et al 2019a 2019b guo et al 2022a and has been used to predict potato yield and help determine if additional n is required by the crop gianquinto et al 2004 olivier et al 2006 leaf flavonoid by contrast is negatively correlated with leaf chlorophyll content and n status i e the increase of leaf flavonoid indicates n deficiency in the crop cartelat et al 2005 because of their opposing relationships with respect to plant n content the ratio of leaf chlorophyll to the flavonoid known as the nitrogen balance index has been described as a better indicator of n status for wheat cartelat et al 2005 corn zhu et al 2011 and broccoli tremblay et al 2009 than either leaf flavonoid or chlorophyll alone cartelat et al 2005 tremblay et al 2011 based on the above analysis we hypothesize that the combined rm with various urea types can improve soil hydrothermal conditions and consequently increase tuber yield and water productivity for rain fed potatoes in a semi arid agroecosystem to test this generalized hypothesis we conducted a three year field experiment in a dryland farming region in northern china from 2018 to 2020 the objectives of this study were to evaluate the main and interaction effects of rm coupled with various urea types on 1 soil water storage and soil temperature and 2 potato n status e g leaf chlorophyll leaf flavonoid and nitrogen balance index tuber yield water productivity and partial factor productivity of nitrogen in addition the economic benefits associated with these practices were quantified 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description field experiments were performed at the experimental farm of qingshuihe county research centre 39 57 n 111 39 e hohhot inner mongolia china over three growing seasons from 2018 to 2020 this region has a typical semi arid mid temperate continental monsoon climate in the loess plateau of china ma et al 2020 soils of the field site are sandy loams with soil fractions of 728 g kg 1 sand 134 g kg 1 silt and138 g kg 1 clay ma et al 2020 basic physical and chemical properties of soils are given in table 1 the monthly precipitation and average air temperature in 2018 2020 and 1981 2017 are shown in fig 2 the highest average monthly temperatures and precipitation occur in july and august respectively fig 2 field water holding capacity is around 24 for the upper 0 60 cm of soil air temperature and rainfall data were collected from a weather station located at the experimental site the drought index di was calculated using the following equation qiang et al 2022 1 di r p r m σ where rp is the growing season precipitation rm is the mean of growing season precipitation and σ is the standard deviation of growing season precipitation di was used to classify years as wet di 0 35 normal 0 35 di 0 35 and dry di 0 35 2 2 experimental design and field management the field experiment was a randomized split plot design with two mulching patterns ridge furrow with plastic film mulching rm and no plastic film mulching nm as main plots and three urea types common urea u controlled release urea c and mixed c and u at a ratio of 1 1 cu as sub plots combinations of the two mulching patterns and the three urea types resulted in six treatments including rmu rmc rmcu nmu nmc and nmcu were repeated three times each of these nmu is the management practice most conventionally employed in the area before planting a total of 18 plots 2 mulching patterns 3 urea types 3 replications 18 plots were established each plot was 49 m2 7 m 7 m and bounded by soil ridges to prevent surface runoff overland flow was not observed between plots during the study period the nitrogen 180 kg ha 1 phosphate 120 kg ha 1 and potassium 150 kg ha 1 fertilizers were applied once before planting potatoes and were buried at 15 cm depth in the middle of the ridges of each plot thereafter no fertilizer was applied to any plot the n fertilizer was in the form of conventional urea 46 n or controlled release urea 44 5 n the latter was polyurethane coated urea granules with a nutrient release cycle of approximately 90 days viko global technology ltd ningxia china the plots under rm were arranged with alternated large ridges 70 cm wide 20 cm high and furrows 40 cm width both mulched by plastic films fig 1 the width and depth of the micro ditch within the ridges were 20 and 10 cm respectively two rows of potatoes were planted in the ridges with 40 cm spacing between rows in all plots fig 1 a series of holes were pierced through the surface of the plastic films by iron wires at an interval of 30 cm to permit rainfall infiltration all plastic films were removed by farmers after harvest the potatoes were solely dependent on natural precipitation during the three growing seasons the agronomic management practices used in this study are shown in table s1 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil physicochemical properties the soil samples were collected before planting and after harvest at 20 cm depth intervals down to a 100 cm depth additional soil samples were also collected at 20 cm depth intervals down to a 60 cm depth at the 0th sowing 40th seeding stage 60th tuber initiation stage 80th tuber bulking stage 100th starch accumulation stage and 120th mature stage days after sowing to collect the soil samples we randomly selected five pairs of plants in each plot and collected the soil from the center of the straight line distance between each pair of plants using a soil augur φ 5 cm after removing the surface crop residue the augers were cleaned using a 70 ethanol solution after each sampling for each plot the five cores from each depth were respectively stored in a polyethylene bag and thoroughly mixed and homogenized to form one composite sample for each soil depth layer the soil cores were weighed wet oven dried at 105 0 c for 24 h and weighed again to obtain the soil gravimetric water content swc hou and li 2019 soil water storage sws mm was calculated as per wang et al 2018 a soil temperature recorder fotel l93 4 thermal instruments shanghai china was buried at 10 cm soil depth between two plants in the ridges of each plot and was used to record soil temperature every 2 h through the entire growing season the daily average soil temperature was calculated as the average of the intraday readings 2 3 2 plant sampling for measuring the plant heights and leaf n status we randomly selected 15 plants in each plot all measurements were carried out at the 40th 60th 80th and 100th days after sowing we used the dualex 4 device force a orsay france for simultaneously measuring the leaf chlorophyll flavonoid and nitrogen balance index on the same leaf spot 19 20 mm2 between 9 00 11 00 am measurements were conducted on the terminal leaflet of the last fully expanded leaf commonly the fourth leaf from the apex of the selected plants the measuring spots of each leaf were selected at the basal middle and apical of the leaf blade avoiding the midribs or physical damages on the adaxial side dong et al 2021 the values measured at these three points were averaged as the mean value of the selected leaf at harvest 10 plants were randomly sampled from each plot and all the tubers were weighed and recorded to determine the yield based on fresh weight the tubers were classified as commercial 150 g per tuber medium 50 150 g and small 50 g tan et al 2016 the number and weight of the commercial tubers are represented by grade 1 and weight 1 respectively medium tubers are represented by grade 2 and weight 2 and small tubers are represented by grade 3 and weight 3 2 3 3 evapotranspiration water productivity and partial factor productivity of nitrogen natural rainfall served as the only water source for crop growth during each growing season the groundwater recharge was assumed to be a negligible input due to the fact that the water table at this site is generally 8 0 m below the ground surface it was noted that local rainfall was generally low during the whole growth period and did not cause deep drainage hence evapotranspiration et mm for individual plots was determined using the formula wang et al 2016 2 et p sws where p mm is the total rainfall amount during the growing season and sws mm is the change in soil water storage 0 100 cm between planting and after harvest i e soil water storage at harvesting minus water storage at planting in the 0 100 cm soil layer water productivity wp kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated using the following formula hou and li 2019 3 wp y et where y is tuber yield kg ha 1 et mm is the evapotranspiration of the corresponding plot partial factor productivity of nitrogen pfpn kg kg 1 was calculated according to ma et al 2020 4 pfpn y n where y is tuber yield kg ha 1 n kg ha 1 is the application rate of n fertilizer 2 3 4 economic analysis the major sources of production input in this study were the cost of labor seed potatoes plastic films fertilizers and herbicides the labor involved in each treatment consisted of land preparation making holes in the plastic films of the rm system sowing and harvesting the cost of labor was estimated at 15 7 usd per farmer per workday based on the local wage standard the price of urea and controlled release urea was estimated at 0 28 usd kg 1 and 0 5 usd kg 1 respectively the output in usd was evaluated based on the tuber weight commercial tubers 150 g per tuber were sold at 0 25 usd kg 1 while medium and small tubers 150 g per tuber were sold at 0 16 usd kg 1 the economic benefit eb was calculated based on the difference between the output and the input values at the local scale 2 4 statistical analysis all data are shown as the mean values of the three plot replicates statistical analyses were carried out in r version 4 1 1 r core team 2022 the analysis of variance anova was performed using the r packages lme4 and lmertest kuznetsova et al

difference lsd approach williams and abdi 2010 at the p 0 05 significance level soil water storage plant height leaf chlorophyll flavonoid nitrogen balance index yield and water productivity of potatoes were analyzed using a three way anova approach with mulching urea type and year as the fixed factors pearson s correlation and principal component analysis pca were performed to elucidate and visualize the relationships among soil parameters and plant characteristics pearson s correlations were determined using the r packages hmisc version 4 6 and corrplot version 0 9 the pca was performed using the r packages vegan version 2 5 7 koutecký 2015 and factominer version 2 4 lê et al 2008 r packages corrplot version 0 9 lattice version 0 2 45 sarkar 2008 ggplot2 version 3 3 5 wickham 2011 and factoextra version 1 07 kassambara and mundt 2017 were used to visualize the results figures were produced using the origin 2021 software 3 results 3 1 weather conditions the precipitation and air temperature data during the three growing seasons are illustrated in fig 2 the air temperature had a similar trend during the three growing seasons and the average air temperature was 19 9 19 1 and 19 6 c in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively total rainfall from planting to harvest was 323 2 270 2 and 264 5 mm in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the total rainfall in 2019 and 2020 was much lower than the average of the corresponding period for the past 37 years quantitatively 2019 di 0 5 and 2020 di 0 8 were considered as drought years and 2018 di 0 2 as a year with normal rainfall 3 2 soil water storage the soil water storage dynamics 0 60 cm were substantially different during the three growing seasons table 2 in 2018 the soil water storage was highest at the 60th d and the 120th d and lowest at the 100th d in 2019 the soil water storage was lowest at the 100th d but then peaked at the potato maturity stages the 120th d in 2020 the soil water storage was lowest at the 60th d and then increased through the later growth stages and peaked at the 120th d in general regardless of treatments soil water storage 0 60 cm was higher in 2018 with normal rainfall than in 2019 and 2020 due to relatively drier weather conditions in addition the soil water storage was relatively high at potato maturity mulching urea type and year affected the soil water storage over the growing seasons but the effects varied at different growth stages table 2 regardless of the urea type the average soil water storage in the 0 60 cm layer under rm significantly p 0 05 increased by 6 7 compared with nm on the other hand urea type alone also significantly p 0 05 affected soil water storage except at the 100th d and the 120th d among the urea types cu decreased the mean soil water storage by 1 9 and 2 3 compared with the u and c respectively at the early growth stages the 40th d the soil water storage under rmu rmc and rmcu on average was significantly p 0 05 higher than that under nmu by 9 8 12 4 and 8 9 respectively however such a difference was not significant among rmu rmc and rmcu when it turned to late growth stages the 60 100th d the soil water storage under rmu and rmc was always higher than that under nmu and nmcu p 0 05 except for the 100th d in 2020 what s more the soil water storage of rmu was higher than that under rmcu p 0 05 at the 80th d while there was no significant difference between nmu nmc and nmcu at maturity the 120th d there was no significant difference in soil water storage among all treatments with the exception of rmu which was significantly p 0 05 higher compared to nmcu 3 3 soil temperature the seasonal dynamics of soil temperatures at 0 10 cm depth are presented in fig 3 under all treatments the soil temperature showed a similar seasonal trend and were influenced by air temperature and precipitation the average soil temperature under different treatments during the 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons ranged from 22 3 24 2 c 21 6 23 2 c and 22 2 23 8 c respectively irrespective of the urea type the daily mean soil temperature was always higher under rm than under nm throughout the growing season in comparison to nm rm increased soil temperature on average by 1 4 c additionally the changes in soil temperature under rm and nm varied with growth stage rm increased soil temperature by 1 9 2 1 c during the early growth stages the 0 40th d by 1 4 1 7 c during the middle growth stages the 41 80th d and by 0 8 0 9 c during the late growth stages compared to nm in summary the differences in soil temperature between rm and nm were the largest during emergence becoming smaller as the plant canopy spread 3 4 leaf chlorophyll nitrogen balance index flavonoid and plant height of potato leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index in 2018 were greater than those in 2019 and 2020 and were affected by mulching urea type and year table s2 overall the leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index under rm were significantly p 0 05 higher than those under nm but the trends differed over the three growing seasons for example in 2018 the leaf chlorophyll first increased and peaked at the 60th d and then declined till crop maturity while the nitrogen balance index decreased over time fig 4 by contrast the leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index showed a bimodal distribution over time in 2019 and 2020 fig 4 in addition at the 40 60th d the leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index under cu were significantly p 0 05 higher than those under c but not under u after the 60th d however these two indicators under cu were higher than those under u p 0 05 in general the leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index under rmu and rmcu were higher than those under nmc and nmcu although no significant differences were observed between rmu and rmcu at the 40 60th d in comparison to nmu rmcu significantly p 0 05 increased the leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index respectively by 6 6 and 9 7 at the 80th d and 8 3 and 13 2 at the 100th d respectively mulching urea type and year affected the leaf flavonoid but the effects varied with growth stages table s2 irrespective of urea type rm significantly reduced the leaf flavonoid compared to nm p 0 05 except at the 40th d regardless of mulching at the 40th d the leaf flavonoid under u and cu were lower than that under c but there was no significant difference at the 60 80th d the leaf flavonoid under cu was lower than that under c p 0 05 with no significant difference between the u and cu while after the 80th d this indicator under cu was lower than that under u p 0 05 the leaf flavonoid increased over time and reached its maximum at the 100th d and ranked as rmcu rmc rmu nmcu nmu nmc fig 4 specifically prior to the 80th d there was no significant difference in leaf flavonoid between rmcu and nmu following that leaf flavonoid levels under rmcu decreased significantly p 0 05 by 3 7 in 2018 3 2 in 2019 and 5 5 in 2020 when compared to that under nmu at the 100th d plant height was significantly affected by mulching urea type and year except at the 40th d table s3 overall the plant height under rm was significantly p 0 05 higher than that under nm the maximum plant height was achieved under cu which was significantly higher than that under c p 0 05 at the 100th d however there was no significant difference in plant height between cu and u in general potato height in 2018 was on average higher than it was in 2019 and 2020 the plant height was significantly p 0 05 higher under rmcu mean 50 cm than under nmc mean 47 2 cm at the 100th d fig s1 on average plant height was ranked as rmcu rmu rmc nmcu nmu nmc 3 5 tuber size the weight and number of tubers averaged for 10 plants under different treatments are given in table 3 grade 1 and grade 2 tubers were significantly affected by mulching urea type and year but only urea type and year significantly affected grade 3 tubers table 4 compared to nm rm increased average grade 1 and grade 2 tubers by 7 7 and 6 1 p 0 05 respectively in addition cu increased average grade 1 tubers more than c by 9 7 p 0 05 but the difference between cu and u was not significant there was no significant difference in grade 2 tubers among u c and cu the interaction of mulching and urea type had significant effects on grade 1 and grade 2 tubers compared to nmu the grade 1 tubers under rmcu increased significantly p 0 05 by 18 0 in 2018 and 28 9 in 2019 but showed no significant differences in 2020 table 3 however on average the maximum grade 2 tubers were achieved under rmc and was relatively lower under rmu nmu and nmc tuber weight 1 was significantly affected by mulching urea type and year urea type and year significantly affected tuber weight 2 but only year significantly affected weight 3 table 4 on average rm improved tuber weight 1 by 18 8 p 0 05 compared with nm however no significant difference in weight 2 and weight 3 was observed between rm and nm in addition tuber weight 1 and weight 2 were the highest under cu intermediate under u and lowest under c of the three growing seasons the highest potato tuber weight 1 was obtained in 2018 followed by 2019 and 2020 the combination of mulching and urea type significantly influenced weight 1 compared to nmu rmu rmc and rmcu increased the tuber weight 1 respectively by 16 4 12 4 and 28 6 p 0 05 on average with the maximum tuber weight 1 under rmcu table 3 3 6 tuber yield water productivity and partial factor productivity of nitrogen the mulching urea type and year significantly affected the tuber yield table 4 overall tuber yield in 2018 were 46 5 and 22 9 higher than those from 2019 and 2020 drought years p 0 05 respectively compared with nm tuber yield under rm increased significantly p 0 05 by 13 0 on average over the growing seasons on average cu significantly p 0 05 increased the tuber yield 7 6 more than u and 11 0 more than c tuber yield followed the order of rmcu rmu nmcu rmc nmu nmc in 2018 and followed the order of rmcu rmu rmc nmcu nmu nmc in 2019 and 2020 table 5 therefore the greatest tuber yield was achieved under rmcu across the three growing seasons with 33 2 t ha 1 in 2018 22 8 t ha 1 in 2019 and 27 2 t ha 1 in 2020 compared with other treatments rmcu increased the tuber yield significantly p 0 05 by 12 5 23 3 in 2018 6 8 30 7 in 2019 and 10 0 27 2 in 2020 moreover in 2019 and 2020 drought years rm treatments i e rmu rmc and rmcu had the most significant tuber yield increase the et was also affected by urea type year and urea type year table 4 but was not significantly affected by two mulching practices cu had higher et compared with c and u p 0 05 following the order of cu u c the et was highest during 2018 304 2 mm followed by 2019 276 6 mm and 2020 214 5 mm we observed that et was higher under rmcu but in most cases the combination of mulching treatments and urea types did not significantly affect et table 5 similar to tuber yield wp and pfpn were affected by mulching urea type and year table 4 the wp and pfpn were higher under rm than under nm with an increase of 13 8 and 13 0 p 0 05 respectively regardless of the mulching patterns compared with u and c cu significantly p 0 05 increased wp on average by 6 5 and 8 9 respectively and pfpn by 7 6 and 11 0 respectively we also observed that the wp and pfpn were significantly different among the three years the interactions between mulching and urea type had significant effects on the wp and pfpn averaged across three growing seasons the wp and pfpn were ranked as follows rmcu rmu rmc nmcu nmu nmc table 5 therefore the highest wp and pfpn were recorded under rmcu 82 4 126 3 kg ha 1mm 1and 126 6 184 4 kg kg 1 respectively while nmc consistently had the lowest wp and pfpn rmcu increased wp and pfpn significantly p 0 05 by 17 4 23 7 and 19 6 23 5 respectively compared to nmu across the three growing seasons 3 7 economic benefit we estimated the economic benefits for the different management practices examined table 6 owing to the expenditure in labor plastic film and controlled release urea rmu rmc and rmcu increased input cost the total input was 2581 7 usd ha 1 for rmu 2674 1 usd ha 1 for rmc and 2627 9 usd ha 1 for rmcu which was 16 7 20 9 and 18 8 higher than that of nmu 2212 7 usd ha 1 respectively furthermore rmu rmc and rmcu all required additional labor at a cost of approximately 117 4 usd ha 1 compared with nmu when compared to nmu the total output under rmu rmc and rmcu was increased by 12 2 9 3 and 23 6 respectively across the three growing seasons rmcu delivered the maximum output which was 7290 6 usd ha 1 in 2018 5188 4 usd ha 1 in 2019 and 5761 9 usd ha 1 in 2020 the average economic profit was in the order of rmcu rmu nmcu nmu rmc nmc across the three growing seasons hence rmcu yielded the highest economic profit at the producer level and potentially increased the gross profit by 21 9 in 2018 38 4 in 2019 and 28 4 in 2020 in comparison to nmu in addition rmcu also achieved higher average output to input ratio 2 3 1 than other treatments though the difference was not significant in all treatments 3 8 correlation among factors the pca biplot fig 5 represents the proportion of model variance contributed by the independent variables while the cosine of the angle between each pair of black arrows represents the correlation between the two variables the first two principal components pc accounted for 73 4 of the variability of the dataset with the first axis separating the rm and nm treatments the pca analysis also showed that rm was associated with higher soil water storage and temperature plant height leaf chlorophyll nitrogen balance index wp pfpn and yield while nm was strongly associated with higher leaf flavonoids fig 5 it also showed a strong association between the nmcu treatment and the production of grade 3 tubers the positive correlations p 0 05 between the tuber yield and other yield components fig s2 indicated that soil water storage and temperature could effectively improve plant height leaf chlorophyll nitrogen balance index of potato thereby increasing the weight 1 weight 2 and ultimately determining the tuber yield 4 discussion 4 1 effects of ridge furrow with plastic film mulching and different urea types on soil water storage and temperature the rm system can not only collect rainwater and reduce soil water evaporation but also improve soil thermal status so as to support a more stable soil hydrothermal conditions in the root zone liu et al 2016 tang et al 2019 liao et al 2022 our study showed that rm coupled with various urea types affected the soil water storage differently along the growth stages of potatoes table 2 during the early and middle growth stages the soil water storage was always higher p 0 05 under rmu rmc and rmcu than under nmu and nmcu especially in the drought seasons 2019 and 2020 which is an indication that rm increased and maintained soil moisture fang et al 2022 these results are explained by the fact that rm helps increase the capacity of rainwater collection by mitigating surface runoff reduces soil water loss due to evaporation and ensures rainwater penetrates the soil ramakrishna et al 2006 zhao et al 2012 hou and li 2019 additionally we noticed that rmcu decreased soil water storage p 0 05 during the middle growth stages when compared to rmu a similar result was indicated by tang et al 2019 who found that the soil water content of rmcu was significantly lower than that of rmu as more soil water was absorbed by robust maize for growth however such a phenomenon was not observed under nm without film mulching there was no significant difference in the soil water storage between nmu nmc and nmcu this may be attributable to the fact that rmcu can provide better hydrothermal conditions than nmcu and allow the synchronized release of n in the soils in concert with crop demand which results in higher water demands by more robust or healthier crops under rmcu hu et al 2013 tang et al 2019 at later growth stages no significant differences in soil water storage were observed between treatments with the exception of rmu which the soil water storage significantly p 0 05 increased when compared to nmcu our results disagreed with qiang et al 2022 who reported that the rm rmu and rmc system maintained lower soil water storage from winter wheat re greening to maturity stages perhaps due to different soil conditions climate conditions and crop types mulching induced temperature shifts in agricultural soil have been widely reported in the literature wang et al 2015 mo et al 2017b for instance zheng et al 2021 found that soil temperature was greatly influenced by mulching methods but no significant difference was observed between the urea types mainly because the physical barrier effect of the plastic film prevents the exchange of heat between the air and soil thereby raising the soil temperature fang et al 2022 overall we noticed that the differences in soil temperature between the rm and nm gradually decreased over the growing stages fig 3 which was similar to that reported by zhao et al 2012 in the present study the mean topsoil temperature under rm was 1 9 2 1 c higher than nm during the early growth stages the 0 40th d fig 3 when smaller plant canopies allow the soil surface to receive more insolation and allow the topsoil to warm up more quickly zhou et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 this was especially important in semi arid areas where rm provided a favorable water thermal environment for successful seedling establishment despite irregular and infrequent rainfall during a cold spring at the middle growth stages the 41 80th d the mean topsoil temperature under rm was 1 4 1 7 c higher than that under nm it was noted that this difference between rm and nm decreased at the last growth stage because more areas of the soil surface were shaded as the plant canopy enlarged zhang et al 2017 hou and li 2019 it is worth noting that potato is a shallow rooted and cool season crop with an optimal daytime temperature of 21 c qin et al 2014 previous studies showed that the effects of mulching on the yield and wp of potatoes were greater when the average air temperature was moderate 15 20 c during the growing season q li et al 2018 plastic film mulching may result in consistently higher temperatures in mid summer and cause heat stress to potatoes zhao et al 2012 zhao et al 2014 indeed our study found that soil temperature under rm was significantly higher than the optimal temperature for tuber growth in the middle of the growing season but rm did not reduce potato yield as also reported by zhao et al 2014 and hou and li 2019 4 2 effects of ridge furrow with plastic film mulching and different urea types on leaf n status and plant height mulching combined with n fertilization in particular increased the soil water content and ensured n supply zhao et al 2022 thereby increasing the plant height leaf chlorophyll content and leaf area in the semi arid regions li and li 2021 fang et al 2022 for instance guo et al 2022c showed that mulching management coupled with controlled release urea blended with urea promoted maize growth delayed leaf senescence and increased chlorophyll content photosynthesis similarly we affirmed that rmcu and rmu improved potato plant height leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index but decreased leaf flavonoid in relation to nmc and nmcu at early and middle growth stages figs s1 and 4 this observation may be attributed to the following three reasons firstly rmcu and rmu can enhance the available soil water content and soil temperature for potato growth table 2 and fig 3 secondly rmcu and rmu can alleviate the imbalance between n demand and supply and promote n absorption by crops guo et al 2022a qiang et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 and thirdly plastic film mulching increases the reflectivity of solar radiation and the resistance of air to water vapor exchange thereby improving the photosynthetic capacity of crops liao et al 2022 at later growth stages leaf n status under rmcu was greater than that under rmu or nmu although such improvement may not always be significant this was mainly because rmcu can effectively reduce n loss and ensure sufficient soil n availability to meet the crop n demand during the process of maturation tang et al 2019 li et al 2020 guo et al 2022a thus rmcu could improve potato growth and help achieve a higher tuber yield than other treatments however the leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index showed different trends during the three growing seasons in 2018 compared with leaf chlorophyll at the 40th d the chlorophyll of leaves increased at the 60th d while in 2019 and 2020 the leaf chlorophyll decreased at the 60th d fig 4 this might be due to the fact that soil water storage was highest at the 60th d of 2018 while soil water storage was lower in 2019 and 2020 indicating a higher water stress in plants table 2 in addition our study showed that the plant height leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index in 2018 normal year were higher than those in 2019 and 2020 drought years figs s1 and 4 by contrast the leaf flavonoid showed an opposite trend fig 4 these mainly resulted from the different rainfall during the three growing seasons fig 2 4 3 effects of ridge furrow with plastic film mulching and urea type on tuber yield water productivity and partial factor productivity of nitrogen a large number of studies have demonstrated that combined rm with various urea types prolongs water and nutrient availability for crop growth and eventually increases crop yields pfpn and wp in a semi arid region liu et al 2016 tang et al 2019 qiang et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 found a significant coupling effect between the use of ridge furrow plastic mulching and the application of slow release urea on winter wheat production which significantly increased yield wp and pfpn but whether it can always increase crop yields is controversial in the present study tuber yield wp and pfpn under rmc were lower than those under rmu and rmcu across the three seasons table 5 this disagreed with previous studies liu et al 2016 zhao et al 2022 such a disparity may be attributed to the climatic conditions cultivation practices soil physicochemical properties and crop types among the various regions similar to our study combining mulching practices with cu significantly increased maize growth yield and n used efficiency guo et al 2022a the reason that rmcu maximized tuber yield wp and pfpn in all growing seasons in our experiment may be attributable firstly to its ability to provide better water thermal conditions of the topsoil during the early growth stages thereby facilitating a higher rate of seedling emergence zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2014 secondly to ensure the long term supply of n for crop growth i e cu not only met the crop s demand for n at the early growth stage but also met the large demand for n at the later growth stage farmaha and sims 2013 guo et al 2022c zhang et al 2022a 2022b and thirdly to improve plant nutrient and water uptake n status and the overall robustness and health figs s1 and 4 furthermore we observed that the highest tuber yield was obtained in 2018 followed by 2020 and 2019 table 4 owing to higher precipitation during the potato growing season in 2018 323 2 mm compared with that in 2019 270 2 mm and 2020 264 5 mm most interestingly irrespective of urea types rm was able to improve the tuber yield wp and pfpn more acutely during drier growing seasons than nm did as was also demonstrated in previous studies gu et al 2021 qiang et al 2022 therefore the effects and underlying mechanisms of rm combined with c or cu influencing tuber yield and wp under different water conditions can be very complex and need to be investigated further in long term studies the overall tuber yield has the highest correlation with tuber weights and numbers table 3 which are important quality and grading indicators of potato qin et al 2014 our experiment showed a significant coupling effect of the mulching and urea type on the production of the grade 1 and weight 1 tubers table 4 our study also showed that rm in particular rmcu was able to increase the number and weight of commercial 150 g tubers similarly qin et al 2014 reported that rm increased the production of larger and medium tubers and decreased the production of small tubers such an improvement is attributed to the fact that rm can increase the emergence rate leading to stronger seedlings and stems and higher number of branches per plant and consequently a greater number of tubers during tuber initiation zhao et al 2014 4 4 effects of ridge furrow with plastic film mulching and urea type on economic benefit economic profitability and efficient logistics determine if a beneficial agronomic management regime will be accepted and adopted by the farmers our data demonstrated that rmu rmc and rmcu had higher input cost than other treatments table 6 due to the expenditure in plastic film and controlled release urea in line with the findings by tang et al 2019 in our study the output was evaluated using economic returns of tuber yield according to local price per unit at the time of this study furthermore increased yield may not necessarily translate into higher profits instead the proportion of commercial grade 150 g largely determines the market value of the potatoes which are estimated to be 56 more expensive than smaller potatoes therefore although there are higher costs of controlled release urea plastic films and labor associated with rmcu and rmc the rmcu practice ensured the highest net return in our study by significantly increasing tuber yield and the proportion of commercial potatoes relative to other treatments tables 3 and 5 li et al 2020 reported that controlled release urea increased the net returns by 65 on sandy and 19 on clay soils when compared to conventional urea application but the high cost of controlled release urea still would be a limiting factor in production our study showed that rmcu significantly increased the gross profit by 38 4 more than nmu largely because it increased the output value and the output to input ratio relative to other treatments table 6 a larger output to input ratio means that the same input produces more output which can be a strong incentive for broader adoption by producers our study provided science based evidence to help convince producers in semi arid dryland farming areas to adopt rmcu in potato production 4 5 limitation and perspective we acknowledge that the rmcu practice resulted in higher tuber yield water productivity and economic benefit in this study however there are some limitations using the rmcu system itself on the one hand the long term use of plastic film can cause a large number of residues that are not easily degraded and have become a widespread environmental problem white pollution gao et al 2019 prata et al 2019 these plastic film residues cannot be completely removed and recycled leaving the majority of them in the soil potentially interfering with mechanical tillage threatening the health of cattle and sheep damaging the soil structure and delaying root development which can be detrimental to sustainable agriculture fan et al 2019 gao et al 2019 to improve the agricultural environment this issue requires resolution through the development of innovative covering materials fortunately environmentally friendly biodegradable plastic film or straw mulching could also improve the soil environment and crop yield which could take the place of conventional plastic film to guarantee the sustainable development of agricultural ecosystems hou and li 2019 prata et al 2019 on the other hand we also acknowledge that only one mixing ratio of urea and controlled release urea was included in our study and the effects of urea and controlled release urea at different mixing ratios will need to be investigated in future studies to refine the results 5 conclusion the ridge furrow with plastic film mulching coupled with blended controlled release urea and urea rmcu increased soil water storage and temperature which in turn contributed to improved plant height leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index of potatoes resulting in a higher tuber yield and proportion of commercial potatoes consequently the water productivity partial factor productivity of nitrogen and economic profit of rmcu significantly increased by 17 4 23 7 19 6 23 5 and 21 9 38 4 respectively compared to the local conventional management practices nmu in summary rmcu is a feasible and effective strategy to improve the tuber yield of potatoes as well as water productivity in rainfed farming systems in semi arid areas future studies are required

8950,ridge furrow with plastic film mulching rm has the potential to enhance crop yields and water productivity particularly in semi arid regions however the combined effects of rm and various urea types on rainfed potato solanum tuberosum l production remain unclear a three year field experiment 2018 2020 was conducted to elucidate the effects of the rm combined with various urea types on water productivity tuber yield and economic benefits in a dryland farming system treatments consisted of two mulching patterns rm and no plastic film mulching nm combined with the application of three urea types common urea u controlled release urea c and mixed c and u at a ratio of 1 1 cu our results indicated that compared to nm the rm system reduced soil evaporative losses which ultimately increased average soil water storage for the 0 60 cm soil layer by 6 7 p 0 05 in addition rm increased the mean soil temperature for the 0 10 cm soil layer by 1 4 c compared with nm these changes in soil under rm helped increase plant height leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index but reduced leaf flavonoid thereby improving tuber yield the application of cu further improved plant height leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index which allowed the exploitation of more soil water to increase tuber yield and water productivity p 0 05 the interactions of mulching and urea type had significant influence on the tuber yield water productivity and partial factor productivity of nitrogen especially with the rmcu rmcu significantly p 0 05 increased potato yield up to 23 5 water productivity 23 7 partial factor productivity of nitrogen 23 5 and economic benefit 38 4 compared to the nmu during both drought and non drought growing seasons we conclude that compared with other treatments rmcu resulted in the highest tuber yield water productivity and economic benefit across three growing seasons and should be considered an effective strategy to foster sustainable potato production in dryland farming systems keywords controlled release urea ridge furrow with plastic film mulching water productivity tuber yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drylands account for approximately 45 of the earth s land area schimel 2010 and are used for rainfed cropping by millions of farmers zhang et al 2021 dryland agriculture is becoming increasingly important to global food security due to increasing food demand by rapidly growing populations solh and van ginkel 2014 potato solanum tuberosum l is the world s fourth largest food crop q li et al 2018a 2018b qin et al 2022 thus its production is crucial for meeting the food demands worldwide liu et al 2020 nevertheless potato production in the main potato growing semi arid regions of china is frequently limited by water shortages and suboptimal field management strategies qin et al 2014 li et al 2018a 2018b chen et al 2019 adopting appropriate agronomy practices and technologies to enhance efficient rainwater collection and utilization is crucial for sustainable crop production in such dryland areas liu et al 2016 ma et al 2020 qiang et al 2022 ridge furrow with plastic film mulching rm system is a low cost micro field rainwater collecting technique that has been developed and widely applied to increase crop production in semi arid regions zhao et al 2014 mo et al 2017a a typical rm system consists of soil surface film mulching and alternating ridge furrow units zhang et al 2020 where soil surface film mulching is primarily utilized to reduce evaporative losses and increase early season soil temperatures zhao et al 2012 liu et al 2016 the ridge furrows also support rainwater collection in the planted area while mitigating surface runoff from heavy rainfall zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a 2022b one of the main attributes of the rm system is that it can improve soil hydrothermal conditions thereby promoting early and stable seedling establishment li et al 2019a 2019b which is important when irrigation is not possible and spring temperatures are low hou et al 2010 qin et al 2014 previous studies demonstrated the potential of the rm system to increase crop production hu et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 by optimizing soil hydrothermal conditions li et al 2013 liang et al 2018 and promoting soil nutrient availability zhou et al 2012 in semi arid regions zhao et al 2014 found that rm increased tuber yield and water productivity wp of potato by 57 4 78 2 and 56 8 70 3 respectively compared with traditional flat planting and without mulching this has been well documented for a number of crops including potato wang et al 2019 maize liu et al 2016 and wheat qiang et al 2022 thus the rm system can be considered critical for ensuring food security in any potato dryland farming area in the world however owing to the lack of irrigation and labor to top dress nitrogen n fertilizers farmers in the semi arid regions in china prefer to apply all n fertilizer at once before plastic film mulching sun et al 2019 qiang et al 2022 with this practice a large amount of available n quickly accumulates in the soil leading to insufficient n supply at the later growth stages thereby limiting photosynthetic efficiency and crop yields sun et al 2019 qiang et al 2022 thus it is important to ensure adequate n fertilizer supply under the rm system during all critical growth stages for potatoes one fertilization strategy is to use controlled release urea which gradually releases n into the soil solution to improve synchrony between soil n availability and crop n demand venterea et al 2011 yang et al 2017 wu et al 2021 it has been reported that controlled release urea application significantly improves n use efficiency and crop yields pack et al 2006 hyatt et al 2010 ziadi et al 2011 li et al 2018a 2018b zhao et al 2022 for example a global meta analysis by zhang et al 2019 found that controlled release urea increased maize yield by 5 3 and n use efficiency by 24 1 compared with urea same n rate yet other studies have shown that controlled release urea releases n too slowly at the early stage after application which may limit crop vegetative growth and n uptake consequently causing yield reductions and lower n use efficiency farmaha and sims 2013 chilundo et al 2016 gao et al 2018 the rate of n released from the controlled release urea is affected by soil moisture and temperature which often cannot be controlled in a field environment grant et al 2012 li et al 2020 furthermore the higher cost of controlled release urea than conventional urea limits its widespread use tang et al 2021 a few studies have been carried out to address the aforementioned issues in order to increase farmers profit margin tang et al 2019 qu et al 2020 one proposed approach is to blend controlled release urea with urea cu which helps meet crop n requirements throughout the entire growing season and the total cost is also reduced due to the decreased controlled release urea ratio zheng et al 2016 guo et al 2022b the application of cu has improved leaf n content and photosynthetic capacity guo et al 2021 and consequently has promoted crop yields payne et al 2015 garcia et al 2018 bai et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a 2022b nevertheless its use for rainfed potato has not been sufficiently studied especially under rm system combining rm with various urea types has the potential to increase nutrient and water availability in soils tang et al 2019 qiang et al 2022 and improve n concentration of leaves sun et al 2011 guo et al 2022a some studies have showed that rm and n application significantly increased leaf area and chlorophyll content compared with flat planting with non mulching li and li 2021 fang et al 2022 the leaf chlorophyll content is strongly correlated to crop n status sun et al 2011 li et al 2019a 2019b guo et al 2022a and has been used to predict potato yield and help determine if additional n is required by the crop gianquinto et al 2004 olivier et al 2006 leaf flavonoid by contrast is negatively correlated with leaf chlorophyll content and n status i e the increase of leaf flavonoid indicates n deficiency in the crop cartelat et al 2005 because of their opposing relationships with respect to plant n content the ratio of leaf chlorophyll to the flavonoid known as the nitrogen balance index has been described as a better indicator of n status for wheat cartelat et al 2005 corn zhu et al 2011 and broccoli tremblay et al 2009 than either leaf flavonoid or chlorophyll alone cartelat et al 2005 tremblay et al 2011 based on the above analysis we hypothesize that the combined rm with various urea types can improve soil hydrothermal conditions and consequently increase tuber yield and water productivity for rain fed potatoes in a semi arid agroecosystem to test this generalized hypothesis we conducted a three year field experiment in a dryland farming region in northern china from 2018 to 2020 the objectives of this study were to evaluate the main and interaction effects of rm coupled with various urea types on 1 soil water storage and soil temperature and 2 potato n status e g leaf chlorophyll leaf flavonoid and nitrogen balance index tuber yield water productivity and partial factor productivity of nitrogen in addition the economic benefits associated with these practices were quantified 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description field experiments were performed at the experimental farm of qingshuihe county research centre 39 57 n 111 39 e hohhot inner mongolia china over three growing seasons from 2018 to 2020 this region has a typical semi arid mid temperate continental monsoon climate in the loess plateau of china ma et al 2020 soils of the field site are sandy loams with soil fractions of 728 g kg 1 sand 134 g kg 1 silt and138 g kg 1 clay ma et al 2020 basic physical and chemical properties of soils are given in table 1 the monthly precipitation and average air temperature in 2018 2020 and 1981 2017 are shown in fig 2 the highest average monthly temperatures and precipitation occur in july and august respectively fig 2 field water holding capacity is around 24 for the upper 0 60 cm of soil air temperature and rainfall data were collected from a weather station located at the experimental site the drought index di was calculated using the following equation qiang et al 2022 1 di r p r m σ where rp is the growing season precipitation rm is the mean of growing season precipitation and σ is the standard deviation of growing season precipitation di was used to classify years as wet di 0 35 normal 0 35 di 0 35 and dry di 0 35 2 2 experimental design and field management the field experiment was a randomized split plot design with two mulching patterns ridge furrow with plastic film mulching rm and no plastic film mulching nm as main plots and three urea types common urea u controlled release urea c and mixed c and u at a ratio of 1 1 cu as sub plots combinations of the two mulching patterns and the three urea types resulted in six treatments including rmu rmc rmcu nmu nmc and nmcu were repeated three times each of these nmu is the management practice most conventionally employed in the area before planting a total of 18 plots 2 mulching patterns 3 urea types 3 replications 18 plots were established each plot was 49 m2 7 m 7 m and bounded by soil ridges to prevent surface runoff overland flow was not observed between plots during the study period the nitrogen 180 kg ha 1 phosphate 120 kg ha 1 and potassium 150 kg ha 1 fertilizers were applied once before planting potatoes and were buried at 15 cm depth in the middle of the ridges of each plot thereafter no fertilizer was applied to any plot the n fertilizer was in the form of conventional urea 46 n or controlled release urea 44 5 n the latter was polyurethane coated urea granules with a nutrient release cycle of approximately 90 days viko global technology ltd ningxia china the plots under rm were arranged with alternated large ridges 70 cm wide 20 cm high and furrows 40 cm width both mulched by plastic films fig 1 the width and depth of the micro ditch within the ridges were 20 and 10 cm respectively two rows of potatoes were planted in the ridges with 40 cm spacing between rows in all plots fig 1 a series of holes were pierced through the surface of the plastic films by iron wires at an interval of 30 cm to permit rainfall infiltration all plastic films were removed by farmers after harvest the potatoes were solely dependent on natural precipitation during the three growing seasons the agronomic management practices used in this study are shown in table s1 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil physicochemical properties the soil samples were collected before planting and after harvest at 20 cm depth intervals down to a 100 cm depth additional soil samples were also collected at 20 cm depth intervals down to a 60 cm depth at the 0th sowing 40th seeding stage 60th tuber initiation stage 80th tuber bulking stage 100th starch accumulation stage and 120th mature stage days after sowing to collect the soil samples we randomly selected five pairs of plants in each plot and collected the soil from the center of the straight line distance between each pair of plants using a soil augur φ 5 cm after removing the surface crop residue the augers were cleaned using a 70 ethanol solution after each sampling for each plot the five cores from each depth were respectively stored in a polyethylene bag and thoroughly mixed and homogenized to form one composite sample for each soil depth layer the soil cores were weighed wet oven dried at 105 0 c for 24 h and weighed again to obtain the soil gravimetric water content swc hou and li 2019 soil water storage sws mm was calculated as per wang et al 2018 a soil temperature recorder fotel l93 4 thermal instruments shanghai china was buried at 10 cm soil depth between two plants in the ridges of each plot and was used to record soil temperature every 2 h through the entire growing season the daily average soil temperature was calculated as the average of the intraday readings 2 3 2 plant sampling for measuring the plant heights and leaf n status we randomly selected 15 plants in each plot all measurements were carried out at the 40th 60th 80th and 100th days after sowing we used the dualex 4 device force a orsay france for simultaneously measuring the leaf chlorophyll flavonoid and nitrogen balance index on the same leaf spot 19 20 mm2 between 9 00 11 00 am measurements were conducted on the terminal leaflet of the last fully expanded leaf commonly the fourth leaf from the apex of the selected plants the measuring spots of each leaf were selected at the basal middle and apical of the leaf blade avoiding the midribs or physical damages on the adaxial side dong et al 2021 the values measured at these three points were averaged as the mean value of the selected leaf at harvest 10 plants were randomly sampled from each plot and all the tubers were weighed and recorded to determine the yield based on fresh weight the tubers were classified as commercial 150 g per tuber medium 50 150 g and small 50 g tan et al 2016 the number and weight of the commercial tubers are represented by grade 1 and weight 1 respectively medium tubers are represented by grade 2 and weight 2 and small tubers are represented by grade 3 and weight 3 2 3 3 evapotranspiration water productivity and partial factor productivity of nitrogen natural rainfall served as the only water source for crop growth during each growing season the groundwater recharge was assumed to be a negligible input due to the fact that the water table at this site is generally 8 0 m below the ground surface it was noted that local rainfall was generally low during the whole growth period and did not cause deep drainage hence evapotranspiration et mm for individual plots was determined using the formula wang et al 2016 2 et p sws where p mm is the total rainfall amount during the growing season and sws mm is the change in soil water storage 0 100 cm between planting and after harvest i e soil water storage at harvesting minus water storage at planting in the 0 100 cm soil layer water productivity wp kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated using the following formula hou and li 2019 3 wp y et where y is tuber yield kg ha 1 et mm is the evapotranspiration of the corresponding plot partial factor productivity of nitrogen pfpn kg kg 1 was calculated according to ma et al 2020 4 pfpn y n where y is tuber yield kg ha 1 n kg ha 1 is the application rate of n fertilizer 2 3 4 economic analysis the major sources of production input in this study were the cost of labor seed potatoes plastic films fertilizers and herbicides the labor involved in each treatment consisted of land preparation making holes in the plastic films of the rm system sowing and harvesting the cost of labor was estimated at 15 7 usd per farmer per workday based on the local wage standard the price of urea and controlled release urea was estimated at 0 28 usd kg 1 and 0 5 usd kg 1 respectively the output in usd was evaluated based on the tuber weight commercial tubers 150 g per tuber were sold at 0 25 usd kg 1 while medium and small tubers 150 g per tuber were sold at 0 16 usd kg 1 the economic benefit eb was calculated based on the difference between the output and the input values at the local scale 2 4 statistical analysis all data are shown as the mean values of the

the average of the corresponding period for the past 37 years quantitatively 2019 di 0 5 and 2020 di 0 8 were considered as drought years and 2018 di 0 2 as a year with normal rainfall 3 2 soil water storage the soil water storage dynamics 0 60 cm were substantially different during the three growing seasons table 2 in 2018 the soil water storage was highest at the 60th d and the 120th d and lowest at the 100th d in 2019 the soil water storage was lowest at the 100th d but then peaked at the potato maturity stages the 120th d in 2020 the soil water storage was lowest at the 60th d and then increased through the later growth stages and peaked at the 120th d in general regardless of treatments soil water storage 0 60 cm was higher in 2018 with normal rainfall than in 2019 and 2020 due to relatively drier weather conditions in addition the soil water storage was relatively high at potato maturity mulching urea type and year affected the soil water storage over the growing seasons but the effects varied at different growth stages table 2 regardless of the urea type the average soil water storage in the 0 60 cm layer under rm significantly p 0 05 increased by 6 7 compared with nm on the other hand urea type alone also significantly p 0 05 affected soil water storage except at the 100th d and the 120th d among the urea types cu decreased the mean soil water storage by 1 9 and 2 3 compared with the u and c respectively at the early growth stages the 40th d the soil water storage under rmu rmc and rmcu on average was significantly p 0 05 higher than that under nmu by 9 8 12 4 and 8 9 respectively however such a difference was not significant among rmu rmc and rmcu when it turned to late growth stages the 60 100th d the soil water storage under rmu and rmc was always higher than that under nmu and nmcu p 0 05 except for the 100th d in 2020 what s more the soil water storage of rmu was higher than that under rmcu p 0 05 at the 80th d while there was no significant difference between nmu nmc and nmcu at maturity the 120th d there was no significant difference in soil water storage among all treatments with the exception of rmu which was significantly p 0 05 higher compared to nmcu 3 3 soil temperature the seasonal dynamics of soil temperatures at 0 10 cm depth are presented in fig 3 under all treatments the soil temperature showed a similar seasonal trend and were influenced by air temperature and precipitation the average soil temperature under different treatments during the 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons ranged from 22 3 24 2 c 21 6 23 2 c and 22 2 23 8 c respectively irrespective of the urea type the daily mean soil temperature was always higher under rm than under nm throughout the growing season in comparison to nm rm increased soil temperature on average by 1 4 c additionally the changes in soil temperature under rm and nm varied with growth stage rm increased soil temperature by 1 9 2 1 c during the early growth stages the 0 40th d by 1 4 1 7 c during the middle growth stages the 41 80th d and by 0 8 0 9 c during the late growth stages compared to nm in summary the differences in soil temperature between rm and nm were the largest during emergence becoming smaller as the plant canopy spread 3 4 leaf chlorophyll nitrogen balance index flavonoid and plant height of potato leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index in 2018 were greater than those in 2019 and 2020 and were affected by mulching urea type and year table s2 overall the leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index under rm were significantly p 0 05 higher than those under nm but the trends differed over the three growing seasons for example in 2018 the leaf chlorophyll first increased and peaked at the 60th d and then declined till crop maturity while the nitrogen balance index decreased over time fig 4 by contrast the leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index showed a bimodal distribution over time in 2019 and 2020 fig 4 in addition at the 40 60th d the leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index under cu were significantly p 0 05 higher than those under c but not under u after the 60th d however these two indicators under cu were higher than those under u p 0 05 in general the leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index under rmu and rmcu were higher than those under nmc and nmcu although no significant differences were observed between rmu and rmcu at the 40 60th d in comparison to nmu rmcu significantly p 0 05 increased the leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index respectively by 6 6 and 9 7 at the 80th d and 8 3 and 13 2 at the 100th d respectively mulching urea type and year affected the leaf flavonoid but the effects varied with growth stages table s2 irrespective of urea type rm significantly reduced the leaf flavonoid compared to nm p 0 05 except at the 40th d regardless of mulching at the 40th d the leaf flavonoid under u and cu were lower than that under c but there was no significant difference at the 60 80th d the leaf flavonoid under cu was lower than that under c p 0 05 with no significant difference between the u and cu while after the 80th d this indicator under cu was lower than that under u p 0 05 the leaf flavonoid increased over time and reached its maximum at the 100th d and ranked as rmcu rmc rmu nmcu nmu nmc fig 4 specifically prior to the 80th d there was no significant difference in leaf flavonoid between rmcu and nmu following that leaf flavonoid levels under rmcu decreased significantly p 0 05 by 3 7 in 2018 3 2 in 2019 and 5 5 in 2020 when compared to that under nmu at the 100th d plant height was significantly affected by mulching urea type and year except at the 40th d table s3 overall the plant height under rm was significantly p 0 05 higher than that under nm the maximum plant height was achieved under cu which was significantly higher than that under c p 0 05 at the 100th d however there was no significant difference in plant height between cu and u in general potato height in 2018 was on average higher than it was in 2019 and 2020 the plant height was significantly p 0 05 higher under rmcu mean 50 cm than under nmc mean 47 2 cm at the 100th d fig s1 on average plant height was ranked as rmcu rmu rmc nmcu nmu nmc 3 5 tuber size the weight and number of tubers averaged for 10 plants under different treatments are given in table 3 grade 1 and grade 2 tubers were significantly affected by mulching urea type and year but only urea type and year significantly affected grade 3 tubers table 4 compared to nm rm increased average grade 1 and grade 2 tubers by 7 7 and 6 1 p 0 05 respectively in addition cu increased average grade 1 tubers more than c by 9 7 p 0 05 but the difference between cu and u was not significant there was no significant difference in grade 2 tubers among u c and cu the interaction of mulching and urea type had significant effects on grade 1 and grade 2 tubers compared to nmu the grade 1 tubers under rmcu increased significantly p 0 05 by 18 0 in 2018 and 28 9 in 2019 but showed no significant differences in 2020 table 3 however on average the maximum grade 2 tubers were achieved under rmc and was relatively lower under rmu nmu and nmc tuber weight 1 was significantly affected by mulching urea type and year urea type and year significantly affected tuber weight 2 but only year significantly affected weight 3 table 4 on average rm improved tuber weight 1 by 18 8 p 0 05 compared with nm however no significant difference in weight 2 and weight 3 was observed between rm and nm in addition tuber weight 1 and weight 2 were the highest under cu intermediate under u and lowest under c of the three growing seasons the highest potato tuber weight 1 was obtained in 2018 followed by 2019 and 2020 the combination of mulching and urea type significantly influenced weight 1 compared to nmu rmu rmc and rmcu increased the tuber weight 1 respectively by 16 4 12 4 and 28 6 p 0 05 on average with the maximum tuber weight 1 under rmcu table 3 3 6 tuber yield water productivity and partial factor productivity of nitrogen the mulching urea type and year significantly affected the tuber yield table 4 overall tuber yield in 2018 were 46 5 and 22 9 higher than those from 2019 and 2020 drought years p 0 05 respectively compared with nm tuber yield under rm increased significantly p 0 05 by 13 0 on average over the growing seasons on average cu significantly p 0 05 increased the tuber yield 7 6 more than u and 11 0 more than c tuber yield followed the order of rmcu rmu nmcu rmc nmu nmc in 2018 and followed the order of rmcu rmu rmc nmcu nmu nmc in 2019 and 2020 table 5 therefore the greatest tuber yield was achieved under rmcu across the three growing seasons with 33 2 t ha 1 in 2018 22 8 t ha 1 in 2019 and 27 2 t ha 1 in 2020 compared with other treatments rmcu increased the tuber yield significantly p 0 05 by 12 5 23 3 in 2018 6 8 30 7 in 2019 and 10 0 27 2 in 2020 moreover in 2019 and 2020 drought years rm treatments i e rmu rmc and rmcu had the most significant tuber yield increase the et was also affected by urea type year and urea type year table 4 but was not significantly affected by two mulching practices cu had higher et compared with c and u p 0 05 following the order of cu u c the et was highest during 2018 304 2 mm followed by 2019 276 6 mm and 2020 214 5 mm we observed that et was higher under rmcu but in most cases the combination of mulching treatments and urea types did not significantly affect et table 5 similar to tuber yield wp and pfpn were affected by mulching urea type and year table 4 the wp and pfpn were higher under rm than under nm with an increase of 13 8 and 13 0 p 0 05 respectively regardless of the mulching patterns compared with u and c cu significantly p 0 05 increased wp on average by 6 5 and 8 9 respectively and pfpn by 7 6 and 11 0 respectively we also observed that the wp and pfpn were significantly different among the three years the interactions between mulching and urea type had significant effects on the wp and pfpn averaged across three growing seasons the wp and pfpn were ranked as follows rmcu rmu rmc nmcu nmu nmc table 5 therefore the highest wp and pfpn were recorded under rmcu 82 4 126 3 kg ha 1mm 1and 126 6 184 4 kg kg 1 respectively while nmc consistently had the lowest wp and pfpn rmcu increased wp and pfpn significantly p 0 05 by 17 4 23 7 and 19 6 23 5 respectively compared to nmu across the three growing seasons 3 7 economic benefit we estimated the economic benefits for the different management practices examined table 6 owing to the expenditure in labor plastic film and controlled release urea rmu rmc and rmcu increased input cost the total input was 2581 7 usd ha 1 for rmu 2674 1 usd ha 1 for rmc and 2627 9 usd ha 1 for rmcu which was 16 7 20 9 and 18 8 higher than that of nmu 2212 7 usd ha 1 respectively furthermore rmu rmc and rmcu all required additional labor at a cost of approximately 117 4 usd ha 1 compared with nmu when compared to nmu the total output under rmu rmc and rmcu was increased by 12 2 9 3 and 23 6 respectively across the three growing seasons rmcu delivered the maximum output which was 7290 6 usd ha 1 in 2018 5188 4 usd ha 1 in 2019 and 5761 9 usd ha 1 in 2020 the average economic profit was in the order of rmcu rmu nmcu nmu rmc nmc across the three growing seasons hence rmcu yielded the highest economic profit at the producer level and potentially increased the gross profit by 21 9 in 2018 38 4 in 2019 and 28 4 in 2020 in comparison to nmu in addition rmcu also achieved higher average output to input ratio 2 3 1 than other treatments though the difference was not significant in all treatments 3 8 correlation among factors the pca biplot fig 5 represents the proportion of model variance contributed by the independent variables while the cosine of the angle between each pair of black arrows represents the correlation between the two variables the first two principal components pc accounted for 73 4 of the variability of the dataset with the first axis separating the rm and nm treatments the pca analysis also showed that rm was associated with higher soil water storage and temperature plant height leaf chlorophyll nitrogen balance index wp pfpn and yield while nm was strongly associated with higher leaf flavonoids fig 5 it also showed a strong association between the nmcu treatment and the production of grade 3 tubers the positive correlations p 0 05 between the tuber yield and other yield components fig s2 indicated that soil water storage and temperature could effectively improve plant height leaf chlorophyll nitrogen balance index of potato thereby increasing the weight 1 weight 2 and ultimately determining the tuber yield 4 discussion 4 1 effects of ridge furrow with plastic film mulching and different urea types on soil water storage and temperature the rm system can not only collect rainwater and reduce soil water evaporation but also improve soil thermal status so as to support a more stable soil hydrothermal conditions in the root zone liu et al 2016 tang et al 2019 liao et al 2022 our study showed that rm coupled with various urea types affected the soil water storage differently along the growth stages of potatoes table 2 during the early and middle growth stages the soil water storage was always higher p 0 05 under rmu rmc and rmcu than under nmu and nmcu especially in the drought seasons 2019 and 2020 which is an indication that rm increased and maintained soil moisture fang et al 2022 these results are explained by the fact that rm helps increase the capacity of rainwater collection by mitigating surface runoff reduces soil water loss due to evaporation and ensures rainwater penetrates the soil ramakrishna et al 2006 zhao et al 2012 hou and li 2019 additionally we noticed that rmcu decreased soil water storage p 0 05 during the middle growth stages when compared to rmu a similar result was indicated by tang et al 2019 who found that the soil water content of rmcu was significantly lower than that of rmu as more soil water was absorbed by robust maize for growth however such a phenomenon was not observed under nm without film mulching there was no significant difference in the soil water storage between nmu nmc and nmcu this may be attributable to the fact that rmcu can provide better hydrothermal conditions than nmcu and allow the synchronized release of n in the soils in concert with crop demand which results in higher water demands by more robust or healthier crops under rmcu hu et al 2013 tang et al 2019 at later growth stages no significant differences in soil water storage were observed between treatments with the exception of rmu which the soil water storage significantly p 0 05 increased when compared to nmcu our results disagreed with qiang et al 2022 who reported that the rm rmu and rmc system maintained lower soil water storage from winter wheat re greening to maturity stages perhaps due to different soil conditions climate conditions and crop types mulching induced temperature shifts in agricultural soil have been widely reported in the literature wang et al 2015 mo et al 2017b for instance zheng et al 2021 found that soil temperature was greatly influenced by mulching methods but no significant difference was observed between the urea types mainly because the physical barrier effect of the plastic film prevents the exchange of heat between the air and soil thereby raising the soil temperature fang et al 2022 overall we noticed that the differences in soil temperature between the rm and nm gradually decreased over the growing stages fig 3 which was similar to that reported by zhao et al 2012 in the present study the mean topsoil temperature under rm was 1 9 2 1 c higher than nm during the early growth stages the 0 40th d fig 3 when smaller plant canopies allow the soil surface to receive more insolation and allow the topsoil to warm up more quickly zhou et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 this was especially important in semi arid areas where rm provided a favorable water thermal environment for successful seedling establishment despite irregular and infrequent rainfall during a cold spring at the middle growth stages the 41 80th d the mean topsoil temperature under rm was 1 4 1 7 c higher than that under nm it was noted that this difference between rm and nm decreased at the last growth stage because more areas of the soil surface were shaded as the plant canopy enlarged zhang et al 2017 hou and li 2019 it is worth noting that potato is a shallow rooted and cool season crop with an optimal daytime temperature of 21 c qin et al 2014 previous studies showed that the effects of mulching on the yield and wp of potatoes were greater when the average air temperature was moderate 15 20 c during the growing season q li et al 2018 plastic film mulching may result in consistently higher temperatures in mid summer and cause heat stress to potatoes zhao et al 2012 zhao et al 2014 indeed our study found that soil temperature under rm was significantly higher than the optimal temperature for tuber growth in the middle of the growing season but rm did not reduce potato yield as also reported by zhao et al 2014 and hou and li 2019 4 2 effects of ridge furrow with plastic film mulching and different urea types on leaf n status and plant height mulching combined with n fertilization in particular increased the soil water content and ensured n supply zhao et al 2022 thereby increasing the plant height leaf chlorophyll content and leaf area in the semi arid regions li and li 2021 fang et al 2022 for instance guo et al 2022c showed that mulching management coupled with controlled release urea blended with urea promoted maize growth delayed leaf senescence and increased chlorophyll content photosynthesis similarly we affirmed that rmcu and rmu improved potato plant height leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index but decreased leaf flavonoid in relation to nmc and nmcu at early and middle growth stages figs s1 and 4 this observation may be attributed to the following three reasons firstly rmcu and rmu can enhance the available soil water content and soil temperature for potato growth table 2 and fig 3 secondly rmcu and rmu can alleviate the imbalance between n demand and supply and promote n absorption by crops guo et al 2022a qiang et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 and thirdly plastic film mulching increases the reflectivity of solar radiation and the resistance of air to water vapor exchange thereby improving the photosynthetic capacity of crops liao et al 2022 at later growth stages leaf n status under rmcu was greater than that under rmu or nmu although such improvement may not always be significant this was mainly because rmcu can effectively reduce n loss and ensure sufficient soil n availability to meet the crop n demand during the process of maturation tang et al 2019 li et al 2020 guo et al 2022a thus rmcu could improve potato growth and help achieve a higher tuber yield than other treatments however the leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index showed different trends during the three growing seasons in 2018 compared with leaf chlorophyll at the 40th d the chlorophyll of leaves increased at the 60th d while in 2019 and 2020 the leaf chlorophyll decreased at the 60th d fig 4 this might be due to the fact that soil water storage was highest at the 60th d of 2018 while soil water storage was lower in 2019 and 2020 indicating a higher water stress in plants table 2 in addition our study showed that the plant height leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index in 2018 normal year were higher than those in 2019 and 2020 drought years figs s1 and 4 by contrast the leaf flavonoid showed an opposite trend fig 4 these mainly resulted from the different rainfall during the three growing seasons fig 2 4 3 effects of ridge furrow with plastic film mulching and urea type on tuber yield water productivity and partial factor productivity of nitrogen a large number of studies have demonstrated that combined rm with various urea types prolongs water and nutrient availability for crop growth and eventually increases crop yields pfpn and wp in a semi arid region liu et al 2016 tang et al 2019 qiang et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 found a significant coupling effect between the use of ridge furrow plastic mulching and the application of slow release urea on winter wheat production which significantly increased yield wp and pfpn but whether it can always increase crop yields is controversial in the present study tuber yield wp and pfpn under rmc were lower than those under rmu and rmcu across the three seasons table 5 this disagreed with previous studies liu et al 2016 zhao et al 2022 such a disparity may be attributed to the climatic conditions cultivation practices soil physicochemical properties and crop types among the various regions similar to our study combining mulching practices with cu significantly increased maize growth yield and n used efficiency guo et al 2022a the reason that rmcu maximized tuber yield wp and pfpn in all growing seasons in our experiment may be attributable firstly to its ability to provide better water thermal conditions of the topsoil during the early growth stages thereby facilitating a higher rate of seedling emergence zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2014 secondly to ensure the long term supply of n for crop growth i e cu not only met the crop s demand for n at the early growth stage but also met the large demand for n at the later growth stage farmaha and sims 2013 guo et al 2022c zhang et al 2022a 2022b and thirdly to improve plant nutrient and water uptake n status and the overall robustness and health figs s1 and 4 furthermore we observed that the highest tuber yield was obtained in 2018 followed by 2020 and 2019 table 4 owing to higher precipitation during the potato growing season in 2018 323 2 mm compared with that in 2019 270 2 mm and 2020 264 5 mm most interestingly irrespective of urea types rm was able to improve the tuber yield wp and pfpn more acutely during drier growing seasons than nm did as was also demonstrated in previous studies gu et al 2021 qiang et al 2022 therefore the effects and underlying mechanisms of rm combined with c or cu influencing tuber yield and wp under different water conditions can be very complex and need to be investigated further in long term studies the overall tuber yield has the highest correlation with tuber weights and numbers table 3 which are important quality and grading indicators of potato qin et al 2014 our experiment showed a significant coupling effect of the mulching and urea type on the production of the grade 1 and weight 1 tubers table 4 our study also showed that rm in particular rmcu was able to increase the number and weight of commercial 150 g tubers similarly qin et al 2014 reported that rm increased the production of larger and medium tubers and decreased the production of small tubers such an improvement is attributed to the fact that rm can increase the emergence rate leading to stronger seedlings and stems and higher number of branches per plant and consequently a greater number of tubers during tuber initiation zhao et al 2014 4 4 effects of ridge furrow with plastic film mulching and urea type on economic benefit economic profitability and efficient logistics determine if a beneficial agronomic management regime will be accepted and adopted by the farmers our data demonstrated that rmu rmc and rmcu had higher input cost than other treatments table 6 due to the expenditure in plastic film and controlled release urea in line with the findings by tang et al 2019 in our study the output was evaluated using economic returns of tuber yield according to local price per unit at the time of this study furthermore increased yield may not necessarily translate into higher profits instead the proportion of commercial grade 150 g largely determines the market value of the potatoes which are estimated to be 56 more expensive than smaller potatoes therefore although there are higher costs of controlled release urea plastic films and labor associated with rmcu and rmc the rmcu practice ensured the highest net return in our study by significantly increasing tuber yield and the proportion of commercial potatoes relative to other treatments tables 3 and 5 li et al 2020 reported that controlled release urea increased the net returns by 65 on sandy and 19 on clay soils when compared to conventional urea application but the high cost of controlled release urea still would be a limiting factor in production our study showed that rmcu significantly increased the gross profit by 38 4 more than nmu largely because it increased the output value and the output to input ratio relative to other treatments table 6 a larger output to input ratio means that the same input produces more output which can be a strong incentive for broader adoption by producers our study provided science based evidence to help convince producers in semi arid dryland farming areas to adopt rmcu in potato production 4 5 limitation and perspective we acknowledge that the rmcu practice resulted in higher tuber yield water productivity and economic benefit in this study however there are some limitations using the rmcu system itself on the one hand the long term use of plastic film can cause a large number of residues that are not easily degraded and have become a widespread environmental problem white pollution gao et al 2019 prata et al 2019 these plastic film residues cannot be completely removed and recycled leaving the majority of them in the soil potentially interfering with mechanical tillage threatening the health of cattle and sheep damaging the soil structure and delaying root development which can be detrimental to sustainable agriculture fan et al 2019 gao et al 2019 to improve the agricultural environment this issue requires resolution through the development of innovative covering materials fortunately environmentally friendly biodegradable plastic film or straw mulching could also improve the soil environment and crop yield which could take the place of conventional plastic film to guarantee the sustainable development of agricultural ecosystems hou and li 2019 prata et al 2019 on the other hand we also acknowledge that only one mixing ratio of urea and controlled release urea was included in our study and the effects of urea and controlled release urea at different mixing ratios will need to be investigated in future studies to refine the results 5 conclusion the ridge furrow with plastic film mulching coupled with blended controlled release urea and urea rmcu increased soil water storage and temperature which in turn contributed to improved plant height leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen balance index of potatoes resulting in a higher tuber yield and proportion of commercial potatoes consequently the water productivity partial factor productivity of nitrogen and economic profit of rmcu significantly increased by 17 4 23 7 19 6 23 5 and 21 9 38 4 respectively compared to the local conventional management practices nmu in summary rmcu is a feasible and effective strategy to improve the tuber yield of potatoes as well as water productivity in rainfed farming systems in semi arid areas future studies are required

8951,irrigation adoption is increasing in humid regions to offset short term dry periods especially at the peak of the growing season low soil moisture at the peak growth stage impacts yield and

monitoring in irrigation scheduling to increase water use efficiency wue without compromising the yield benefits camporese et al 2021 hanson et al 2000 kumar et al 2022 li et al 2019 moreira et al 2016 shang and mao 2006 studies have also observed varying impacts of irrigation scheduling on nue in different conditions ballester et al 2021 tested nue under three irrigation frequencies and lower than recommended fertilizer rates and found the intermediate irrigation frequency most effective for producing lint lu et al 2021 found an increase in nue with reduction in irrigation for wheat under monsoon climates da cunha leme filho et al 2020 compared two different irrigation treatments and four different n treatments for corn and found that nue decreased with increasing application amounts and irrigation treatments didn t impact the nue additionally studies show that a n application beyond a range determined by soil climatic and field management practices may result in yield losses and lower nue gao et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 irrigation and nutrient management are challenging in regions with sandy soils and humid climates sandy soils experience soil moisture deficit due to the lower water holding capacity of soils at the same time humid regions also encounter higher nutrient leaching when irrigation is paired with frequent intense precipitation events zurweller et al 2019 therefore planning and adoption of water management practices to offset both moisture deficit and excess moisture conditions is vital for humid regions where supplement irrigation has a potential for widespread nutrient pollution through surface runoff and sub surface leaching lassaletta et al 2016 li et al 2018 wang and li 2019 however variation and unpredictability of precipitation still presents a significant uncertainty in management decisions that impact nue and wue previous studies have tried to maintain adequate soil moisture using frequent light irrigation for humid regions rather than the less frequent heavy irrigation observed in arid regions sadler et al 2003 this method of high frequency and light irrigation has also been proven to improve wue and nue limit n leaching and maintain optimal n levels in corn and sandy soils liu et al 2019 hunsaker et al 1998 phene and beale 1976 however the major limitation of this method is the financial and logistical burdens on farmers due to the increase in irrigation applications especially at times of high gas prices and labor shortages irrigation scheduling techniques that make use of weather forecasts could help address these issues to increase crop productivity wue and nue anupoju et al 2021 attia et al 2021 bergez et al 2002 bergez and garcia 2010 nie et al 2021 vazifedoust et al 2008 zhang and guo 2016 computational modeling studies have evaluated both seasonal and short term forecasted precipitation in irrigation water management cai et al 2011 jamal et al 2018 sangha et al 2020 wang and cai 2009 wilks and wolfe 1998 while the seasonal forecasts provide better lead time and can be used to support decisions about crop type crop pattern and crop placement within irrigated or non irrigated fields short term forecasts have higher accuracy for use in irrigation scheduling an vo et al 2019 jamal et al 2019 sangha et al 2020 the impact of using climate services has been studied using quantitative models or by dissemination of forecast among control groups of farmers and then evaluating the impacts on yield maini and rathore 2011 mapanje et al 2021 however model results may be biased towards the assumptions of risk and trust level in forecast among the farmers relative to model roudier et al 2014 additionally studies that use control groups to directly assess the impact of weather forecasts face the challenge of controlling the information that is leaked to the control group this can be a major hurdle for such studies as it is difficult to ensure that the control group is not influenced by the forecast information additionally studies that use control groups to directly assess the impact of weather forecasts face the challenge of controlling the information that is leaked to the control group this can be a major hurdle for such studies as it is difficult to ensure that the control group is not influenced by the forecast information tall et al 2018 studies have used both deterministic and stochastic weather forecasts in irrigation scheduling however the major limitation of deterministic irrigation scheduling methods is the inherent assumption that under a specific scenario all meteorological parameters such as precipitation wind speed radiation are known with certainty however in practice actual weather often differs from the forecasted conditions therefore the use of probabilistic weather forecasts in irrigation scheduling is helpful in developing optimal irrigation scheduling cai et al 2011 but the effectiveness and challenges of using probabilistic weather forecasts as well as their impact on nue and wue have not been studied in a field experiment for major field crops the goal of this study is to develop a rule based approach to irrigation scheduling using short term weather forecasts and assess its impacts on yield nue and wue for corn and cotton in humid climates in conjunction with real time soil water content crop physiological status and water needs the weather forecast is used to determine the timing and volume of irrigation applied this study was conducted over two years at a field station in suffolk virginia with our novel scheduling approach compared to a non irrigated ni and reference irrigation treatment using four n levels additionally the financial viability of the different treatments was analyzed based on fertilizer fuel and sale price 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and experimental setup the two year study 2020 2021 was conducted for corn and cotton at virginia tech s tidewater agricultural research and extension center arec at suffolk virginia fig 1 soils at the study location were a moderately well drained and deep emporia fine sandy loam and the site experiences an average of 787 mm of rainfall between may and october usda wss 2023 irrigation was applied using a zimmatic lateral move variable rate irrigation vri system water for the vri system was supplied by a pond and the system was powered by a diesel motor the study was designed using split plot arrangement with irrigation as main plot factor and n treatment as sub plot factor under randomized split plot design with four replicates for corn and cotton each plot was 4 rows wide and 15 2 m long the row spacing for corn and cotton was 0 91 m a standard practice in the tidewater region to minimize overlap of nutrient and irrigation treatments 9 14 m alleys were used between each irrigation treatment and 6 meter border plots were planted between corn and cotton the crop management and planting dates are summarized in table 1 2 2 treatments and field data the study included four n treatments and three treatments for irrigation the four n treatments were varied amounts at increments of 90 kg n ha 1 for corn nitrogen treatments of corn were 0 90 kg n ha 1 180 kg n ha 1 and 270 kg n ha 1 for cotton n treatments varied at increments of 45 kg n ha 1 i e 0 kg n ha 1 45 kg n ha 1 90 kg n ha 1 and 135 kg n ha 1 in all fertilizer treatments liquid ammonium nitrate was subsurface banded between the rows at side dress in a split application with 25 of the n applied at planting in a starter band and 75 applied at v5 v7 in corn and matchhead square in cotton the three irrigation treatments were non irrigated ni full irrigation fi and weather informed irrigation wi under the ni treatment irrigation was not applied under the fi treatment the soil moisture was maintained above 70 of plant available water capacity pawc of the soil regardless of predicted precipitation and sufficient irrigation was applied to bring soil moisture back to field capacity thus fi treatment was irrigated more often and at a greater depth than wi treatment the fi treatment avoided conditions of limited soil moisture and the excess irrigation allows us to quantify the impact of excess soil moisture conditions finally the wi treatment aimed to avoid water stress conditions but also avoid saturated conditions that could result in runoff and deep percolation based on vwc readings and rainfall forecasts the volumetric water content vwc in the field was monitored using sentek triscan capacitance probes which sense vwc at every 100 mm 4 in to 1000 mm 36 in depth one probe was installed in each irrigation treatment zone for each crop all corn probes were in the 180 kg n ha 1 n treatment and all cotton probes were installed in the 90 kg n ha 1 n treatment a weather station was installed at the field to capture hourly field weather conditions including precipitation temperature solar radiation dew point vapor pressure relative humidity leaf wetness wind direction and wind speed the weather forecast information for the wi irrigation treatment was obtained from gridded 2 5 km by 2 5 km data products produced by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa national weather service nws the probability of precipitation pop provides a probability of receiving precipitation of greater than or equal to 0 254 mm 0 01 in at any point in the forecast area and forecast period this information was available at 12 hour intervals up to 7 days in advance the quantitative precipitation forecast qpf provides a measurable amount of precipitation greater than 0 254 mm forecasted for any time within the forecasted period qpf data was available at 6 hour intervals forecasts of reference crop evapotranspiration fret is the expected depth of evapotranspiration et from a reference crop short crop with approximate height of 12 cm under the forecasted weather conditions on a daily time step over the next 7 days the reference et value by crop coefficients for each crop growth stage using food and agriculture organization crop coefficients values for corn and cotton allen et al 1998 an r script ran daily to obtain the forecasted weather conditions for the next 72 h probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecasts pqpf were then calculated using pop and qpf while pop obtained from nws is the probability of precipitation above 0 254 mm pqpf is the probability of precipitation above a specific threshold value in this study the threshold was assigned as the daily cet calculated using fret thus the pqpf value of interest is the probability of rainfall exceeding cet denoted the probability of exceedance poe pqpf is based on a climatological distribution which is similar to exponential distribution and calculated in two steps amburn and frederick 2006 firstly the conditional quantitative precipitation forecast μ defined as the expected depth of precipitation given that precipitation occurs is given by μ qpf pop the conditional probability of precipitation exceeding cet given that precipitation occurs is calculated assuming an exponential distribution of expected rainfall depths pr p cet p 0 e cet μ the unconditional probability of precipitation exceeding cet poe is then given by poe pr p cet pr p cet p 0 pop the highest frequency of rainfall amounts is typically non zero when the weather event is expected to cause widespread rainfall and pop is above 90 under such circumstances estimating exceedance probabilities using the gamma distribution where the alpha term equals 3 delivers more accurate results than the exponential distribution amburn and frederick 2006 similar results for high pop have been observed in previous studies by donald et al 1970 therefore poe when pop was above 90 was calculated using poe 0 5 e x β x 2 β 2 2 x β 2 pop where β qpf 3 2 3 irrigation scheduling to estimate soil moisture in the root zone we first determined effective root depth based on crop stage and the observed changes in soil moisture revealed by soil moisture probes effective rooting depth was determined using the soil water extraction patterns observed using soil moisture sensors volumetric water content observations in shallow zones exhibited a daily pattern that included drawdown of soil moisture during daylight hours whereas deeper volumetric water content observations did not exhibit these patterns irmak and rudnick 2014 irmak and rudnick 2014 each sentek probe reported vwc as a percentage of the unit volume of soil for each of the nine vwc sensors spaced at 100 mm 4 in intervals once the effective root depth was determined root zone soil moisture rsm was calculated using observed vwc for each sensor within the effective root zone soil field capacity fc for root zone was determined using vwc observed after 48 h of soil saturation in the field using soil moisture sensors in rootzone sui and vories 2020 vories and sudduth 2021 wp for each sensor depth was determined based on soil texture fc wp and rsm reported as percent of the unit volume of soil were converted to inches of available water within the root zone using following equation rsm mm 1 n vwc n 4 100 25 4 where rsm mm is soil moisture in inches vwc n is the vwc of sensor measured in inches of water per inch of soil x 100 at n depth in the increments of 102 mm n is the number of sensors within the root zone this value is multiplied by 0 04 to convert sensor readings to an estimate of water content in inches across the each 102 mm interval monitored by each individual sensor it is then converted to mm by multiplying with 25 4 the root zone depletion dp was measured as dp obs 100 fc rsm mm pawc where rsm mm is the observed root zone soil moisture pawc is plant available water content measure as difference between soil moisture at wilting point and soil moisture at field capacity for both the fi and wi treatments a set of decision rules were developed to determine the timing of irrigation as well as the depth of irrigation applied fig 2 three trigger levels were decided based on observed dp of soil moisture using these trigger levels for fi treatment irrigation was applied if dp observed dp 1 irrespective of poe irrigation was applied for wi treatment when dp 2 dp observed dp 3 and poe 0 25 dp 3 dp observed dp 4 and poe 0 6 dp observed dp 4 irrespective of poe where dp observed is the observed depletion and values of dp1 through dp4 are presented in table 2 in practice dp observed was not observed to fall below dp 4 irrigation depth in the wi treatment was calculated as follows d wi 0 75 pawc rsm sensor qpf et f irrigation depth in the fi treatment was calculated as d fi pawc rsm sensor where d wi and d wfi is the depth of irrigation applied in mm under wi and fi treatment respectively pawc is the plant available water content fc wp rsm sensor is the current soil moisture in the root zone qpf is the depth of forecasted precipitation over the next 72 h and et f is the forecasted crop evapotranspiration over the next 24 h in instances where the prescribed irrigation depth exceeds 12 7 mm this amount was applied over two irrigation events to avoid exceeding the infiltration capacity of the soil 2 4 data collection and analysis the irrigation and nutrient treatments were analyzed based on yield wue and nue for corn the entire plot was harvested at maturity using a small plot harvester and yield was determined on a 15 5 moisture basis in cotton harvest was conducted 21 days after defoliation following virginia cooperative extension recommendations for cotton frame et al 2016 case ih 2555 cotton picker modified with automatic weigh system using harvester master generic harvest system to weigh plots prior to harvest a 25 boll lint sample was collected to determine lint percentage and lint quality nitrogen uptake was quantified by biomass sampling a meter of row from each plot for corn the biomass sample was taken at black layer and for cotton it was collected at 1st open boll data was check for normality and outliers were discarded the nue is a widely used indicator to access the efficiency of n applications duan et al 2014 langholtz et al 2021 nue has been defined in several ways in the literature and can be broadly categorized as fertilizer based plant based soil based or by approach of isotope based or systems based congreves et al 2021 ladha et al 2005 in this study nue was calculated using recovery efficiency i e the apparent increase in plant n uptake in response to the n inputs this was calculated using the n uptake for the treatment relative to control and thus accounts for background soil n levels the nue was calculated as follows nue n t n o n rate where nt is the n uptake in a specified nutrient treatment kg n ac no is the n uptake in no fertilizer treatment and nrate is the amount of n applied in a specific n treatment irrigation wue has been defined in several ways in the literature based on observations and standpoint of the discipline wue could be defined based on agronomic e g using the ratio of produced biomass or economic yield or physiological perspectives e g co2 assimilation to water consumed bos 1985 sinclair et al 1984 in this study irrigation wue was calculated as an indicator of the efficiency of crop production system corresponding to the amount of irrigation applied the wue was calculated using the following equation ullah et al 2019 wue y i y ni d where yi is the yield of irrigated crop kg ha 1 yni is the yield of ni crop and d is the depth of irrigation applied kg ha 1 the profitability of different irrigation treatments was estimated by calculating the difference in variable operational costs of fuel for irrigation pumping as well as the difference in revenue from yields under each treatment using recent prices for corn cotton and fuel table 3 prices were based on average 2022 fuel prices obtained from us energy information administration and crop prices were obtained from macrotrends macrotrends 2022 quinn 2019 us eia 2022 this analysis is based on the variable input costs associated with irrigation fuel and doesn t consider investment ownership or labor costs the fuel usage in each irrigation event and per acre inch of water applied were calculated using extension irrigation budgets developed by university of georgia department of agricultural and applied economics assuming 65 acres of diesel powered center pivot irrigation university of georgia 2021 fuel costs ai are calculated as follows fuel cost 0 044 hp cf t coverage i n where 0 044 is a conversion factor with units gallons horsepower hour hp is horsepower of the engine cf is cost of fuel per gallon tcoverage is average time for full irrigation application hours in is the total number of irrigation events during the growing season and was calculated as annual acre inch applied divided by average application rate this analysis assumed the use of a 65 hp pump and an average application time of 0 67 h per acre change in financial returns from ni treatment were calculated for each treatment for both corn and cotton using equation c returns r t r 0 r 0 0 4 where r t is the return from a given n and irrigation treatment and r 0 is the return from ni and given treatment and 0 4 is conversion factor from per acre to per ha thus all costs are calculated as a financial different relative to a baseline scenario of ni and corresponding n treatment 2 5 statistical analysis the impacts of n treatment and irrigation on nue wue and yield were analyzed using liner mixed effects models from lme4 package in r bates et al 2015 linear mixed effects models consider both fixed effects which are consistent across treatments groups and random effects that vary across treatment groups the n application and irrigation were considered as fixed effects and replicates were considered as random effects as follows y ij α j i β i x i ε i for n and irrigation treatmen t i 1 to 12 α j i a b u j n j for replicates j 1 to 4 where α j i is the varying intercept based on random replicates and the fixed the treatments β i and b are fixed slopes a is the fixed replicate intercept x i and u j represents predictor variables at treatment and replicate levels and ε i and n j are independent error terms regression models were fit separately for each year due to significant difference between yield across n rates in the years for corn and cotton for each year the interaction effects were evaluated between the treatments using anova main effects were evaluated when no significant interactions occurred between the treatments the mean difference of treatment effects lsd was performed using predictmeans function from predict means package lu et al 2021 the predictmeans function is used to diagnose and make inferences from lmer models and generates means and standard errors and performs contrasts and multiple comparisons a probability level of less than 0 05 was considered significant all the data analysis was performed using the r studio 4 1 r core team 2021 3 results 3 1 variation of precipitation irrigation and soil moisture through time table 4 presents a summary of rainfall and irrigation events in corn based on growth stage growth stages were determined by growing degree days corn received 610 and 664 mm of rainfall in 2020 and 2021 respectively july 2020 was the driest month in the growing season and received only 45 7 mm of rain therefore four applications provided a total of 89 mm and 132 mm of irrigation for wi irrigation and fi treatments respectively during the dry spell of july 2020 table 4 in 2021 may was the driest month in the growing season and rainfall was more evenly distributed in the following months with short dry spells at the end of june and july in 2021 corn received three irrigation applications in june and july compared to fi wi irrigation decreased irrigation by 43 2 and 17 8 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 4 during both years all irrigation treatments were between the v12 and r3 stages of corn table 4 during the cotton growing season the study area received 757 and 715 mm of rainfall in 2020 and 2021 respectively in 2020 104 mm of irrigation was applied for the wi treatment and 163 mm was used for the fi treatment table 5 in 2021 three irrigation applications were made and a total of 30 5 mm were applied for wi treatment and 56 mm were applied for fi treatment in both years no irrigation was applied to the ni treatment of corn and cotton it should be noted that several major rainfall events occurred in 2020 which influenced the study results due to hurricane isaias the study area received 127 mm of rain for six days between 3rd 8th august corn was at the r2 r3 stage at the time of this tropical storm and cotton was between the first flower and peak blooming table 4 and table 5 additionally two heavy rainfall events occurred on the 9th and 18th of september due to hurricane sally corn was harvested at this time and cotton was near the defoliation stage during these rainfall events 241 and 260 mm of rainfall occurred in august and september 2020 respectively table 5 3 2 corn results in 2020 anova results indicate that yield varied significantly across n treatments but not between irrigation treatments or nrate x irrigation interactions across n treatments yield was higher in 180 and 270 kg n ha 1 treatments than 90 kg n ha 1 and 0 kg n ha 1 p 0 05 fig 3 b although insignificant yield was higher in wi yields were higher than fi for the 180 kg n ha 1 treatment which is where the probe used for irrigation scheduling was located but lower in the 270 kg n ha 1 and 90 kg n ha 1 applications table 6 anova results indicate that nue was related to interactive effects between irrigation and n in 2020 nue was higher at 180 kg n ha 1 under wi irrigation than 270 and 90 kg n ha 1 treatment under wi irrigation fig 3 a nue was not significant between n rates and irrigation in both years while not significant wi resulted in the highest nue 0 82 at 180 kg n ha 1 similar to nue 0 81 at 270 kg n ha 1 with fi indicating better nue with lower inputs table 6 no significant relationships between irrigation treatment n treatment or their interactions were observed for wue while not significant wue was higher in wi irrigation than fi table 6 taken together 2020 data suggests that wi resulted in better nue at 180 kg n ha 1 than other wi treatments this could possibly stem from the fact that irrigation volumes in the 270 kg n ha 1 zones were still based on a sensor in the 180 kg n ha 1 zone better yields were observed at higher n treatments in 2021 yield varied across n rates and increase in yield was observed with an increasing n rate however similar to 2020 yield was not significant for irrigation treatments or nrate x irrigation interactions highest yield was observed at 270 n treatment and decreased with n rates fig 3 c while not significant wi yields were higher than fi under all n treatments table 6 in 2021 no significant relationships between irrigation treatment n treatment or their interactions were observed for nue or wue table 6 while not significant wi showed improved nue and wue at 90 and 180 kg n ha 1 treatments the wue was higher under wi in all n treatments table 6 3 3 cotton results in 2020 anova results indicate a significantly different cotton yield under irrigation and nrates but not the nrate x irrigation interactions p 0 05 table 7 cotton yields were higher at 135 kg n ha 1 treatment than 45 kg n ha 1 fig 4 a cotton yields were lower under fi treatment from ni indicating significantly higher yield losses due to fi p 0 05 fig 4 b while not significantly cotton yields were better in wi than fi treatment table 7 anova results indicate that no difference between nue and wue were observed under irrigation n treatments and nrate x irrigation interactions wue was negative for both wi and fi treatments due to lower yields than ni indicating that no yield benefits were observed with supplement irrigation in 2020 table 7 as indicated in anova results significant difference in cotton yields were observed only under nrate but not across irrigation treatments or nrate x irrigation interactions in 2021 overall an increase in yields overall increased with n rates fig 4 c while not significant yield was higher with wi irrigation than both fi and ni anova results indicate a significant difference in wue under n treatments but not under irrigation or nrate x irrigation interactions fig 4 d although insignificant wue and nue were higher for wi irrigation than fi and wi 3 4 profitability the trends for profitability were similar to those for yield indicating the price increase in fuel inputs were compensated by the increase in yields especially at higher n rates fig 5 in 2021 the corn returns were higher under wi irrigation at all n treatments in 2020 fi resulted in economic losses at 180 kg n ha 1 treatment negative returns indicate economical losses due to additional irrigation primarily due to reduction in yield economic trends for cotton were also similar to the yields in both years in 2020 ni resulted in higher yields and economical losses were observed for both fi and wi irrigation treatments in 2021 wi irrigation resulted in higher profits than fi at 45 kg n ha 1 and 90 kg n ha 1 irrigation whereas fi resulted in economic losses in 90 kg n ha 1 treatment 4 discussion 4 1 irrigation with respect to crop growth stage and impacts on yield nue and wue irrigation with respect to the crop stage plays a vital role in the overall yield and wue of the crop irrigation for corn was applied near or after the tasseling stage table 4 corn is susceptible to water stress during tasseling and early reproductive stages previous studies have shown that the irrigation in the reproductive stages of crops is more important than in the early vegetative stages in order to achieve a high crop yield fang et al 2014 consideration of nutrient levels in irrigation management and information on site specific soil moisture conditions is highly important to prevent over or under irrigation bondesan et al 2022 the soil moisture sensor was installed in the 180 kg n ha 1 treatment which might have resulted in under irrigation of 270 kg n ha 1 treatment water stress affects the availability of crop n due to the reduction in mineralization and root activity qi et al 2020 shao et al 2013 lower nue at 270 kg n ha 1 treatment under wi confirms this notion therefore irrigation management is important at higher n rates to make use of increased n availability our results are consistent with previous research demonstrating that higher n application doesn t necessarily correspond to higher n uptake no significant difference in nue was observed for n application rates in both years previous studies have observed a decrease in corn response to high n application rates resulting in lower corn nue ciampitti and vyn 2012 salvagiotti et al 2011 additionally in 2021 nue was greater than 100 under wi and fi 90 kg n ha 1 and 180 kg n ha 1 treatment in this study nue was calculated using recovery efficiency and incorporated both applied and soil n nue above 100 could be due to the priming effects of soil priming effects are short term changes in soil organic matter due to interactions between living and organic matter kuzyakov 2010 kuzyakov et al 2000 it should also be noted that nue from research plots is often greater than production fields under same practices due to difference in scales of fertilizer and irrigation management practices cassman et al 2002 dobermann 2007 results in cotton in 2020 were notable due to the higher yields observed in the ni treatment relative to both irrigation treatments for cotton dry periods prompting irrigation occurred before the peak bloom table 5 precipitation was frequent in the early growth stages july and was supplemented by one irrigation to maintain appropriate soil moisture irrigation in july and subsequent rainfall in august may have also leached more n below the root zone in the irrigated treatments resulting in lower yields additionally in 2020 two major rainfall events due to tropical storms were observed in the following weeks 2020 08 03 to 2020 08 09 and 8 13 2020 to 8 16 2020 the growth stage between the first square and first flower is moderately sensitive to water stress but higher moisture more than crop water demand may result in excess vegetative growth and impacts cotton yield chalise et al 2022 ermanis et al 2021 perry and barnes 2015 additionally cotton yields were potentially impacted due to higher rainfall in the flowering stage which may lead to flowers and young bolls falling off cetin and basbag 2010 these results suggest the need for irrigation strategies in cotton that are specific to the growth stage of the plant and potential for nutrient leaching instead of soil moisture data alone 4 2 challenges of weather informed irrigation and nutrient management in humid climates with sandy soils sandy soils of the coastal regions adds another layer of complexity to irrigation scheduling due to lower pawc and a higher risk of nutrient leaching davis et al 2003 supplemental irrigation in humid areas controls a narrow range of depletion where the water storage capacity in the soil must be identified more effectively to accommodate the possibility of rainfall as experienced in this study conditions of moisture stress and excess can be separated by as little as a week wi irrigation from this study provides an approach to maximize the soil storage reserve for rainfall after irrigation by leveraging weather forecast information to improve wue without impacting the yields however the effects of irrigation can be seen in a dry or a normal condition under humid climates the study years were relatively wet years which may have impacted the results in this study the wi under some n treatments didn t perform better than ni and fi treatment this has been observed in previous studies where irrigation decision using short term weather forecast did not account the longer outlooks beyond the weather forecast window and thus resulted in either excess or limited soil moisture conditions cai et al 2011 previous studies have incorporated weather forecast data into irrigation schedules and have proven that it can potentially reduce irrigation water through improved wue cai et al 2011 gowing and ejieji 2001 lorite et al 2015 wang and cai 2009 however in this field study it was observed that the accuracy of soil moisture storage to accommodate rain is highly influenced by the forecast accuracy of the qpf in accuracy and uncertainties in short term forecasts to maintain appropriate soil moisture conditions remains a key challenge as we focus on farmers as end users of climate forecasting services in humid areas one of the significant challenges in using wi irrigation is the resolution of the available forecast data the nws weather forecast information is available at a 2 5 km grid the pop is calculated based on the likelihood that precipitation will occur and the expected areal extent of that precipitation convective rainfall in humid subtropical climates often results in high intensity rainfall over very small spatial extents that are difficult to capture in observational data and gridded meteorological products schroeer et al 2018 farming decisions using pop for irrigation could lead to the application of irrigation followed shortly by rainfall or the delay of irrigation even when no rainfall ultimately occurs for instance the study area received little to no rainfall between july 10th 2020 to july 27th 2020 as the depletion increased precipitation with pop of 0 43 was expected to bring 12 7 mm of rain according to the forecast on july 21st 2020 and irrigation was postponed however the study area didn t receive any rainfall as a result irrigation as triggered on 23rd july 2020 on the other hand july 30th 2020 we applied irrigation because the pop was 0 18 however on the following day area received 6 35 mm of rainfall one possible solution employed in recent studies includes various machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of the short term weather forecast frnda et al 2022 rasp and lerch 2018 additionally studies have shown that use of longer time frame forecast may be helpful against seasonal droughts jamal et al 2019 4 3 practical implications of forecast data for irrigation management the use of forecast data poses a challenge regarding practical implications because of the accuracy of precipitation with lead time even at a well equipped research station with efficient field management incorporating weather forecasts is a challenge for implementation at our study location field managers must prepare for irrigation move irrigation pipes and enter application depths the day before irrigating to ensure that an event could be initiated the following morning therefore research and recommendations particularly methods that prescribe frequent application of small irrigation depths or variable rate irrigation must account for the wide range of labor required across different types of irrigation systems and longer planning at the farm level to accommodate any misfunction of irrigating equipment and other field challenges additionally studies using the forecasts for irrigation scheduling must account for intra day changes in forecasted precipitation this is especially challenging for farmers during peak growing seasons as a delay of just one day could lead to detrimental depletion levels moreover the forecasted depth of precipitation was often underpredicted for high precipitation events resulting in over irrigation water logging and surface runoff for example the weather forecast predicted 5 33 mm of rainfall on 48 h lead time 7 36 mm on 24 h lead time and 12 7 mm on the day of 6th august 2020 however the study area received 41 9 mm of rainfall that day similarly on 3rd august 22 3 mm of precipitation was predicted 24 h in advance and increased to 25 4 mm on the day of the event but the study area received 38 1 mm zhu and pi 2014 also found significantly lower amounts of predicted heavy precipitation for 3 day or extended forecasts this creates a challenge in identifying the adequate water storage capacity of the soil for rainfall which is essential for humid regions and sandy soils given potential inaccuracies in forecasted rainfall growers using supplemental irrigation should be aware of the different impacts of excess or limited soil moisture throughout the growing season for instance many crops are less sensitive to water stress in early growth stages soil moisture depletion can be greater during early growth stages to avoid excess water and vertical nitrogen movement but should be avoided during later growth stages when crops become more sensitive to water stress even if rainfall is expected in any case precision fertilization strategies such as split applications or fertigation will be beneficial in reducing the risk and volume of nitrogen lost through leaching additional research efforts are needed to make weather informed precision irrigation beneficial and practical for growers research in precision irrigation in humid climates should include weather forecasts to better understand the tradeoffs between yield and irrigation inputs in particular research that quantifies the impacts of over and under irrigation on yields profitability and environmental impacts across different growing stages could support dynamic irrigation strategies that have a higher likelihood of maintaining optimal soil moisture levels in the face of imperfect weather forecasts future studies would focus on combining both short term and long term forecast in a field study climatic variations such as enso could be helpful to predict the frequency of tropical storms which could guide the longer outlook for irrigation additionally the accuracy of weather forecast should be tested before the growing season and the correction factors could be developed at regional scales using machine learning techniques and regional climatic data 5 conclusions irrigation management is complicated in humid regions due to both moisture stress and excess conditions prevailing over a short period of time additionally water stress is more prevalent due to lower water holding capacity of sandy soils which are more prone to n leaching under excess moisture conditions this study quantified the impacts of using short term weather forecasts in two years of field trials for corn and cotton in humid climates under sandy soils a split plot experiment was used to assess yield nue and wue under three irrigation no irrigation weather informed and full irrigation and four nitrogen treatments our weather informed irrigation strategy was based on a novel approach that integrates probabilistic rainfall forecasts with soil moisture sensor data to avoid conditions of excess or depleted soil moisture the yield varied significantly among n rates but not under irrigation treatments nue in corn was significantly different between wi irrigation at 180 and 270 kg n ha 1 for cotton the results in each year varied due to the amount of precipitation and irrigation with respect to crop stage financial analysis suggest that yield benefits associated with forecast informed irrigation outweigh fuel costs even though relatively favorable rainfall conditions in our study years led to good ni yields one challenge in successfully using forecast data for irrigation is the accuracy of predicted irrigation amounts additional irrigation research that incorporates forecast accuracy could lead to further benefits it is suggested that precision irrigation studies providing irrigation scheduling advice schedule advise must account for the practical need for growers to manage irrigation along with wide range of competing demands for their time and attention nevertheless our results suggest that forecast informed irrigation can improve yields nue and wue in humid climates where variable rainfall conditions and sandy soils make irrigation scheduling a challenge declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

8951,irrigation adoption is increasing in humid regions to offset short term dry periods especially at the peak of the growing season low soil moisture at the peak growth stage impacts yield and limits the plant s capacity to uptake nitrogen resulting in low nutrient use efficiency nue however heavy rainfall on fields with supplemental irrigation may result in waterlogging and surface runoff leading to nutrient leaching and runoff this ultimately can lead to lower nue poor water use efficiency wue reduced yields and water quality impacts this makes irrigation management challenging in humid regions as irrigators must avoid both limited and excess water conditions this field study aimed to develop and test an irrigation management methodology using real time soil water availability crop physiological status water needs and short term weather forecasts information from national weather service a rule based approach determined by soil moisture depletion and short term weather forecasts was used to trigger irrigation to avoid both stress and excess water conditions this method was tested in two years of field trials in suffolk virginia to quantify its impacts on yield nue wue and financial returns in corn and cotton under four nitrogen application treatments the relative impact of irrigation and nitrogen treatment was quantified using mixed effects models the yield nue and wue were impacted by both precipitation and irrigation patterns significantly different yields were observed under nrates treatments for both corn and cotton the trends of economic returns were similar to yield and were significantly different between recent and historic prices this study also discusses the impacts of reliability and practical challenges of using weather informed irrigation

agriculture accounts for 70 of global water use fao 2017 in the united states us irrigation accounted for 42 of freshwater withdrawals and 62 of the total water consumption water not returned to the source after being withdrawn the highest consumption among all water use sectors in 2015 dieter et al 2015 irrigation adoption is also increasing in humid regions to offset short term in season droughts especially at the peak of the growing season paoletti and shortridge 2020 walton 2014 on the other hand human acceleration of the n cycle has resulted in a tenfold increase in usage of mineral nitrogen fertilizer between 1911 before the commercialization of the haber bosch process and 1960 12 tg n y 1 and another tenfold increase in the usage of nitrogen between 1960 and 2013 110 tg n y 1 battye et al 2017 this increase is unlikely to be reversed in the near future as an estimated 48 of the world s population depended on n for food in the early 21st century erisman et al 2008 galloway et al 2008 the increase in reactive n results in severe environmental issues ranging from local water and air pollution to global climate change gruber and galloway 2008 nitrogen leaching increases under higher water application and n fertilization wang et al 2021 muhammad et al 2022 therefore careful consideration of the impacts of irrigation and n is important at the field scale for sustainable agricultural systems dai et al 2019 croplands with a potential for n losses through deep percolation exist along the atlantic coastal plain extending from alabama northward through eastern va and the delmarva peninsula potter et al 2006 in northeast us n losses average 44 kg per ha 39 pounds per acre per year waterborne sediment accounted for the highest 34 of the losses followed by 29 losses through volatilization and 17 losses dissolved in runoff and leachate potter et al 2006 excessive n application can have a significant economic impact on the growers in the us unused n results in fertilizer costs of about 6 billion dollars per year houlton et al 2013 yield loss associated with low nutrient use efficiency nue ranges between 9 and 24 for corn and soybeans egli and hatfield 2014a 2014b over 2021 2022 fertilizer prices are well above average and the farm input prices increased more than double the general inflation rate in the us largely impacting energy and fertilizer input prices langemeier 2022 although the optimum amount of n may vary with the crop type and field management practices a common finding of previous research is that n uptake is highly dependent on soil moisture conditions dai et al 2019 sincik et al 2013 improvements in nue and associated gains in environmental conservation were anticipated through precision n and water management still that promise has yet to be realized due to limitations in adoption of technology primarily due to low returns based on current crop practices basso et al 2019 schimmelpfennig 2016 traditionally the main aim of irrigation scheduling techniques was to increase crop productivity with the optimum use of available resources in the past two decades various studies found the use of real time soil moisture monitoring in irrigation scheduling to increase water use efficiency wue without compromising the yield benefits camporese et al 2021 hanson et al 2000 kumar et al 2022 li et al 2019 moreira et al 2016 shang and mao 2006 studies have also observed varying impacts of irrigation scheduling on nue in different conditions ballester et al 2021 tested nue under three irrigation frequencies and lower than recommended fertilizer rates and found the intermediate irrigation frequency most effective for producing lint lu et al 2021 found an increase in nue with reduction in irrigation for wheat under monsoon climates da cunha leme filho et al 2020 compared two different irrigation treatments and four different n treatments for corn and found that nue decreased with increasing application amounts and irrigation treatments didn t impact the nue additionally studies show that a n application beyond a range determined by soil climatic and field management practices may result in yield losses and lower nue gao et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 irrigation and nutrient management are challenging in regions with sandy soils and humid climates sandy soils experience soil moisture deficit due to the lower water holding capacity of soils at the same time humid regions also encounter higher nutrient leaching when irrigation is paired with frequent intense precipitation events zurweller et al 2019 therefore planning and adoption of water management practices to offset both moisture deficit and excess moisture conditions is vital for humid regions where supplement irrigation has a potential for widespread nutrient pollution through surface runoff and sub surface leaching lassaletta et al 2016 li et al 2018 wang and li 2019 however variation and unpredictability of precipitation still presents a significant uncertainty in management decisions that impact nue and wue previous studies have tried to maintain adequate soil moisture using frequent light irrigation for humid regions rather than the less frequent heavy irrigation observed in arid regions sadler et al 2003 this method of high frequency and light irrigation has also been proven to improve wue and nue limit n leaching and maintain optimal n levels in corn and sandy soils liu et al 2019 hunsaker et al 1998 phene and beale 1976 however the major limitation of this method is the financial and logistical burdens on farmers due to the increase in irrigation applications especially at times of high gas prices and labor shortages irrigation scheduling techniques that make use of weather forecasts could help address these issues to increase crop productivity wue and nue anupoju et al 2021 attia et al 2021 bergez et al 2002 bergez and garcia 2010 nie et al 2021 vazifedoust et al 2008 zhang and guo 2016 computational modeling studies have evaluated both seasonal and short term forecasted precipitation in irrigation water management cai et al 2011 jamal et al 2018 sangha et al 2020 wang and cai 2009 wilks and wolfe 1998 while the seasonal forecasts provide better lead time and can be used to support decisions about crop type crop pattern and crop placement within irrigated or non irrigated fields short term forecasts have higher accuracy for use in irrigation scheduling an vo et al 2019 jamal et al 2019 sangha et al 2020 the impact of using climate services has been studied using quantitative models or by dissemination of forecast among control groups of farmers and then evaluating the impacts on yield maini and rathore 2011 mapanje et al 2021 however model results may be biased towards the assumptions of risk and trust level in forecast among the farmers relative to model roudier et al 2014 additionally studies that use control groups to directly assess the impact of weather forecasts face the challenge of controlling the information that is leaked to the control group this can be a major hurdle for such studies as it is difficult to ensure that the control group is not influenced by the forecast information additionally studies that use control groups to directly assess the impact of weather forecasts face the challenge of controlling the information that is leaked to the control group this can be a major hurdle for such studies as it is difficult to ensure that the control group is not influenced by the forecast information tall et al 2018 studies have used both deterministic and stochastic weather forecasts in irrigation scheduling however the major limitation of deterministic irrigation scheduling methods is the inherent assumption that under a specific scenario all meteorological parameters such as precipitation wind speed radiation are known with certainty however in practice actual weather often differs from the forecasted conditions therefore the use of probabilistic weather forecasts in irrigation scheduling is helpful in developing optimal irrigation scheduling cai et al 2011 but the effectiveness and challenges of using probabilistic weather forecasts as well as their impact on nue and wue have not been studied in a field experiment for major field crops the goal of this study is to develop a rule based approach to irrigation scheduling using short term weather forecasts and assess its impacts on yield nue and wue for corn and cotton in humid climates in conjunction with real time soil water content crop physiological status and water needs the weather forecast is used to determine the timing and volume of irrigation applied this study was conducted over two years at a field station in suffolk virginia with our novel scheduling approach compared to a non irrigated ni and reference irrigation treatment using four n levels additionally the financial viability of the different treatments was analyzed based on fertilizer fuel and sale price 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and experimental setup the two year study 2020 2021 was conducted for corn and cotton at virginia tech s tidewater agricultural research and extension center arec at suffolk virginia fig 1 soils at the study location were a moderately well drained and deep emporia fine sandy loam and the site experiences an average of 787 mm of rainfall between may and october usda wss 2023 irrigation was applied using a zimmatic lateral move variable rate irrigation vri system water for the vri system was supplied by a pond and the system was powered by a diesel motor the study was designed using split plot arrangement with irrigation as main plot factor and n treatment as sub plot factor under randomized split plot design with four replicates for corn and cotton each plot was 4 rows wide and 15 2 m long the row spacing for corn and cotton was 0 91 m a standard practice in the tidewater region to minimize overlap of nutrient and irrigation treatments 9 14 m alleys were used between each irrigation treatment and 6 meter border plots were planted between corn and cotton the crop management and planting dates are summarized in table 1 2 2 treatments and field data the study included four n treatments and three treatments for irrigation the four n treatments were varied amounts at increments of 90 kg n ha 1 for corn nitrogen treatments of corn were 0 90 kg n ha 1 180 kg n ha 1 and 270 kg n ha 1 for cotton n treatments varied at increments of 45 kg n ha 1 i e 0 kg n ha 1 45 kg n ha 1 90 kg n ha 1 and 135 kg n ha 1 in all fertilizer treatments liquid ammonium nitrate was subsurface banded between the rows at side dress in a split application with 25 of the n applied at planting in a starter band and 75 applied at v5 v7 in corn and matchhead square in cotton the three irrigation treatments were non irrigated ni full irrigation fi and weather informed irrigation wi under the ni treatment irrigation was not applied under the fi treatment the soil moisture was maintained above 70 of plant available water capacity pawc of the soil regardless of predicted precipitation and sufficient irrigation was applied to bring soil moisture back to field capacity thus fi treatment was irrigated more often and at a greater depth than wi treatment the fi treatment avoided conditions of limited soil moisture and the excess irrigation allows us to quantify the impact of excess soil moisture conditions finally the wi treatment aimed to avoid water stress conditions but also avoid saturated conditions that could result in runoff and deep percolation based on vwc readings and rainfall forecasts the volumetric water content vwc in the field was monitored using sentek triscan capacitance probes which sense vwc at every 100 mm 4 in to 1000 mm 36 in depth one probe was installed in each irrigation treatment zone for each crop all corn probes were in the 180 kg n ha 1 n treatment and all cotton probes were installed in the 90 kg n ha 1 n treatment a weather station was installed at the field to capture hourly field weather conditions including precipitation temperature solar radiation dew point vapor pressure relative humidity leaf wetness wind direction and wind speed the weather forecast information for the wi irrigation treatment was obtained from gridded 2 5 km by 2 5 km data products produced by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa national weather service nws the probability of precipitation pop provides a probability of receiving precipitation of greater than or equal to 0 254 mm 0 01 in at any point in the forecast area and forecast period this information was available at 12 hour intervals up to 7 days in advance the quantitative precipitation forecast qpf provides a measurable amount of precipitation greater than 0 254 mm forecasted for any time within the forecasted period qpf data was available at 6 hour intervals forecasts of reference crop evapotranspiration fret is the expected depth of evapotranspiration et from a reference crop short crop with approximate height of 12 cm under the forecasted weather conditions on a daily time step over the next 7 days the reference et value by crop coefficients for each crop growth stage using food and agriculture organization crop coefficients values for corn and cotton allen et al 1998 an r script ran daily to obtain the forecasted weather conditions for the next 72 h probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecasts pqpf were then calculated using pop and qpf while pop obtained from nws is the probability of precipitation above 0 254 mm pqpf is the probability of precipitation above a specific threshold value in this study the threshold was assigned as the daily cet calculated using fret thus the pqpf value of interest is the probability of rainfall exceeding cet denoted the probability of exceedance poe pqpf is based on a climatological distribution which is similar to exponential distribution and calculated in two steps amburn and frederick 2006 firstly the conditional quantitative precipitation forecast μ defined as the expected depth of precipitation given that precipitation occurs is given by μ qpf pop the conditional probability of precipitation exceeding cet given that precipitation occurs is calculated assuming an exponential distribution of expected rainfall depths pr p cet p 0 e cet μ the unconditional probability of precipitation exceeding cet poe is then given by poe pr p cet pr p cet p 0 pop the highest frequency of rainfall amounts is typically non zero when the weather event is expected to cause widespread rainfall and pop is above 90 under such circumstances estimating exceedance probabilities using the gamma distribution where the alpha term equals 3 delivers more accurate results than the exponential distribution amburn and frederick 2006 similar results for high pop have been observed in previous studies by donald et al 1970 therefore poe when pop was above 90 was calculated using poe 0 5 e x β x 2 β 2 2 x β 2 pop where β qpf 3 2 3 irrigation scheduling to estimate soil moisture in the root zone we first determined effective root depth based on crop stage and the observed changes in soil moisture revealed by soil moisture probes effective rooting depth was determined using the soil water extraction patterns observed using soil moisture sensors volumetric water content observations in shallow zones exhibited a daily pattern that included drawdown of soil moisture during daylight hours whereas deeper volumetric water content observations did not exhibit these patterns irmak and rudnick 2014 irmak and rudnick 2014 each sentek probe reported vwc as a percentage of the unit volume of soil for each of the nine vwc sensors spaced at 100 mm 4 in intervals once the effective root depth was determined root zone soil moisture rsm was calculated using observed vwc for each sensor within the effective root zone soil field capacity fc for root zone was determined using vwc observed after 48 h of soil saturation in the field using soil moisture sensors in rootzone sui and vories 2020 vories and sudduth 2021 wp for each sensor depth was determined based on soil texture fc wp and rsm reported as percent of the unit volume of soil were converted to inches of available water within the root zone using following equation rsm mm 1 n vwc n 4 100 25 4 where rsm mm is soil moisture in inches vwc n is the vwc of sensor measured in inches of water per inch of soil x 100 at n depth in the increments of 102 mm n is the number of sensors within the root zone this value is multiplied by 0 04 to convert sensor readings to an estimate of water content in inches across the each 102 mm interval monitored by each individual sensor it is then converted to mm by multiplying with 25 4 the root zone depletion dp was measured as dp obs 100 fc rsm mm pawc where rsm mm is the observed root zone soil moisture pawc is plant available water content measure as difference between soil moisture at wilting point and soil moisture at field capacity for both the fi and wi treatments a set of decision rules were developed to determine the timing of irrigation as well as the depth of irrigation applied fig 2 three trigger levels were decided based on observed dp of soil moisture using these trigger levels for fi treatment irrigation was applied if dp observed dp 1 irrespective of poe irrigation was applied for wi treatment when dp 2 dp observed dp 3 and poe 0 25 dp 3 dp observed dp 4 and poe 0 6 dp observed dp 4 irrespective of poe where dp observed is the observed depletion and values of dp1 through dp4 are presented in table 2 in practice dp observed was not observed to fall below dp 4 irrigation depth in the wi treatment was calculated as follows d wi 0 75 pawc rsm sensor qpf et f irrigation depth in the fi treatment was calculated as d fi pawc rsm sensor where d wi and d wfi is the depth of irrigation applied in mm under wi and fi treatment respectively pawc is the plant available water content fc wp rsm sensor is the current soil moisture in the root zone qpf is the depth of forecasted precipitation over the next 72 h and et f is the forecasted crop evapotranspiration over the next 24 h in instances where the prescribed irrigation depth exceeds 12 7 mm this amount was applied over two irrigation events to avoid exceeding the infiltration capacity of the soil 2 4 data collection and analysis the irrigation and nutrient treatments were analyzed based on yield wue and nue for corn the entire plot was harvested at maturity using a small plot harvester and yield was determined on a 15 5 moisture basis in cotton harvest was conducted 21 days after defoliation following virginia cooperative extension recommendations for cotton frame et al 2016 case ih 2555 cotton picker modified with automatic weigh system using harvester master generic harvest system to weigh plots prior to harvest a 25 boll lint sample was collected to determine lint percentage and lint quality nitrogen uptake was quantified by biomass sampling a meter of row from each plot for corn the biomass sample was taken at black layer and for cotton it was collected at 1st open boll data was check for normality and outliers were discarded the nue is a widely used indicator to access the efficiency of n applications duan et al 2014 langholtz et al 2021 nue has been defined in several ways in the literature and can be broadly categorized as fertilizer based plant based soil based or by approach of isotope based or systems based congreves et al 2021 ladha et al 2005 in this study nue was calculated using recovery efficiency i e the apparent increase in plant n uptake in response to the n inputs this was calculated using the n uptake for the treatment relative to control and thus accounts for background soil n levels the nue was calculated as follows nue n t n o n rate where nt is the n uptake in a specified nutrient treatment kg n ac no is the n uptake in no fertilizer treatment and nrate is the amount of n applied in a specific n treatment irrigation wue has been defined in several ways in the literature based on observations and standpoint of the discipline wue could be defined based on agronomic e g using the ratio of produced biomass or economic yield or physiological perspectives e g co2 assimilation to water consumed bos 1985 sinclair et al 1984 in this study irrigation wue was calculated as an indicator of the efficiency of crop production system corresponding to the amount of irrigation applied the wue was calculated using the following equation ullah et al 2019 wue y i y ni d where yi is the yield of irrigated crop kg ha 1 yni is the yield of ni crop and d is the depth of irrigation applied kg ha 1 the profitability of different irrigation treatments was estimated by calculating the difference in variable operational costs of fuel for irrigation pumping as well as the difference in revenue from yields under each treatment using recent prices for corn cotton and fuel table 3 prices were based on average 2022 fuel prices obtained from us energy information administration and crop prices were obtained from macrotrends macrotrends 2022 quinn 2019 us eia 2022 this analysis is based on the variable input costs associated with irrigation fuel and doesn t consider investment ownership or labor costs the fuel usage in each irrigation event and per acre inch of water applied were calculated using extension irrigation budgets developed by university of georgia department of agricultural and applied economics assuming 65 acres of diesel powered center pivot irrigation university of georgia 2021 fuel costs ai are calculated as follows fuel cost 0 044 hp cf t coverage i n where 0 044 is a conversion factor with units gallons horsepower hour hp is horsepower of the engine cf is cost of fuel per gallon tcoverage is average time for full irrigation application hours in is the total number of irrigation events during the growing season and was calculated as annual acre inch applied divided by average application rate this analysis assumed the use of a 65 hp pump and an average application time of 0 67 h per acre change in financial returns from ni treatment were calculated for each treatment for both corn and cotton using equation c returns r t r 0 r 0 0 4 where r t is the return from a given n and irrigation treatment and r 0 is the return from ni and given treatment and 0 4 is conversion factor from per acre to per ha thus all costs are calculated as a financial different relative to a baseline scenario of ni and corresponding n treatment 2 5 statistical analysis the impacts of n treatment and irrigation on nue wue and yield were analyzed using liner mixed effects models from lme4 package in r bates et al 2015 linear mixed effects models consider both fixed effects which are consistent across treatments groups and random effects that vary across treatment groups the n application and irrigation were considered as fixed effects and replicates were considered as random effects as follows y ij α j i β i x i ε i for n and irrigation treatmen t i 1 to 12 α j i a b u j n j for replicates j 1 to 4 where α j i is the varying intercept based on random replicates and the fixed the treatments β i and b are fixed slopes a is the fixed replicate intercept x i and u j represents predictor variables at treatment and replicate levels and ε i and n j are independent error terms regression models were fit separately for each year due to significant difference between yield across n rates in the years for corn and cotton for each year the interaction effects were evaluated between the treatments using anova main effects were evaluated when no significant interactions occurred between the treatments the mean difference of treatment effects lsd was performed using predictmeans function from predict means package lu et al 2021 the predictmeans function is used to diagnose and make inferences from lmer models and generates means and standard errors and performs contrasts and multiple comparisons a probability level of less than 0 05 was considered significant all the data analysis was performed using the r studio 4 1 r core team 2021 3 results 3 1 variation of precipitation irrigation and soil moisture through time table 4 presents a summary of rainfall and irrigation events in corn based on growth stage growth stages were determined by growing degree days corn received 610 and 664 mm of rainfall in 2020 and 2021 respectively july 2020 was the driest month in the growing season and received only 45 7 mm of rain therefore four applications provided a total of 89 mm and 132 mm of irrigation for wi irrigation and fi treatments respectively during the dry spell of july 2020 table 4 in 2021 may was the driest month in the growing season and rainfall was more evenly distributed in the following months with short dry spells at the end of june and july in 2021 corn received three irrigation applications in june and july compared to fi wi irrigation decreased irrigation by 43 2 and 17 8 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 4 during both years all irrigation treatments were between the v12 and r3 stages of corn table 4 during the cotton growing season the study area received 757 and 715 mm of rainfall in 2020 and 2021 respectively in 2020 104 mm of irrigation was applied for the wi treatment and 163 mm was used for the fi treatment table 5 in 2021 three irrigation applications were made and a total of 30 5 mm were applied for wi treatment and 56 mm were applied for fi treatment in both years no irrigation was applied to the ni treatment of corn and cotton it should be noted that several major rainfall events occurred in 2020 which influenced the study results due to hurricane isaias the study area received 127 mm of rain for six days between 3rd 8th august corn was at the r2 r3 stage at the time of this tropical storm and cotton was between the first flower and peak blooming table 4 and table 5 additionally two heavy rainfall events occurred on the 9th and 18th of september due to hurricane sally corn was harvested at this time and cotton was near the defoliation stage during these rainfall events 241 and 260 mm of rainfall occurred in august and september 2020 respectively table 5 3 2 corn results in 2020 anova results indicate that yield varied significantly across n treatments but not between irrigation treatments or nrate x irrigation interactions across n treatments yield was higher in 180 and 270 kg n ha 1 treatments than 90 kg n ha 1 and 0 kg n ha 1 p 0 05 fig 3 b although insignificant yield was higher in wi yields were higher than fi for the 180 kg n ha 1 treatment which is where the probe used for irrigation scheduling was located but lower in the 270 kg n ha 1 and 90 kg n ha 1 applications table 6 anova results indicate that nue was related to interactive effects between irrigation and n in 2020 nue was higher at 180 kg n ha 1 under wi irrigation than 270 and 90 kg n ha 1 treatment under wi irrigation fig 3 a nue was not significant between n rates and irrigation in both years while not significant wi resulted in the highest nue 0 82 at 180 kg n ha 1 similar to nue 0 81 at 270 kg n ha 1 with fi indicating better nue with lower inputs table 6 no significant relationships between irrigation treatment n treatment or their interactions were observed for wue while not significant wue was higher in wi irrigation than fi table 6 taken together 2020 data suggests that wi resulted in better nue at 180 kg n ha 1 than other wi treatments this could possibly stem from the fact that irrigation volumes in the 270 kg n ha 1 zones were still based on a sensor in the 180 kg n ha 1 zone better yields were observed at higher n treatments in 2021 yield varied across n rates and increase in yield was observed with an increasing n rate however similar to 2020 yield was not significant for irrigation treatments or nrate x irrigation interactions highest yield was observed at 270 n treatment and decreased with n rates fig 3 c while not significant wi yields were higher than fi under all n treatments table 6 in 2021 no significant relationships between irrigation treatment n treatment or their interactions were observed for nue or wue table 6 while not significant wi showed improved nue and wue at 90 and 180 kg n ha 1 treatments the wue was higher under wi in all n treatments table 6 3 3 cotton results in 2020 anova results indicate a significantly different cotton yield under irrigation and nrates but not the nrate x irrigation interactions p 0 05 table 7 cotton yields were higher at 135 kg n ha 1 treatment than 45 kg n ha 1 fig 4 a cotton yields were lower under fi treatment from ni indicating significantly higher yield losses due to fi p 0 05 fig 4 b while not significantly cotton yields were better in wi than fi treatment table 7 anova results indicate that no difference between nue and wue were observed under irrigation n treatments and nrate x irrigation interactions wue was negative for both wi and fi treatments due to lower yields than ni indicating that no yield benefits were observed with supplement irrigation in 2020 table 7 as indicated in anova results significant difference in cotton yields were observed only under nrate but not across irrigation treatments or nrate x irrigation interactions in 2021 overall an increase in yields overall increased with n rates fig 4 c while not significant yield was higher with wi irrigation than both fi and ni anova results indicate a significant difference in wue under n treatments but not under irrigation or nrate x irrigation interactions fig 4 d although insignificant wue and nue were higher for wi irrigation than fi and wi 3 4 profitability the trends for profitability were similar to those for yield indicating the price increase in fuel inputs were compensated by the increase in yields especially at higher n rates fig 5 in 2021 the corn returns were higher under wi irrigation at all n treatments in 2020 fi resulted in economic losses at 180 kg n ha 1 treatment negative returns indicate economical losses due to additional irrigation primarily due to reduction in yield economic trends for cotton were also similar to the yields in both years in 2020 ni resulted in higher yields and economical losses were observed for both fi and wi irrigation treatments in 2021 wi irrigation resulted in higher profits than fi at 45 kg n ha 1 and 90 kg n ha 1 irrigation whereas fi resulted in economic losses in 90 kg n ha 1 treatment 4 discussion 4 1 irrigation with respect to crop growth stage and impacts on yield nue and wue irrigation with respect to the crop stage plays a vital role in the overall yield and wue of the crop irrigation for corn was applied near or after the tasseling stage table 4 corn is susceptible to water stress during tasseling and early reproductive stages previous studies have shown that the irrigation in the reproductive stages of crops is more important than in the early vegetative stages in order to achieve a high crop yield fang et al 2014 consideration of nutrient levels in irrigation management and information on site specific soil moisture conditions is highly important to prevent over or under irrigation bondesan et al 2022 the soil moisture sensor was installed in the 180 kg n ha 1 treatment which might have resulted in under irrigation of 270 kg n ha 1 treatment water stress affects the availability of crop n due to the reduction in mineralization and root activity qi et al 2020 shao et al 2013 lower nue at 270 kg n ha 1 treatment under wi confirms this notion therefore irrigation management is important at higher n rates to make use of increased n availability our results are consistent with previous research demonstrating that higher n application doesn t necessarily correspond to higher n uptake no significant difference in nue was observed for n application rates in both years previous studies have observed a decrease in corn response to high n application rates resulting in lower corn nue ciampitti and vyn 2012 salvagiotti et al 2011 additionally in 2021 nue was greater than 100 under wi and fi 90 kg n ha 1 and 180 kg n ha 1 treatment in this study nue was calculated using recovery efficiency and incorporated both applied and soil n nue above 100 could be due to the priming effects of soil priming effects are short term changes in soil organic matter due to interactions between living and organic matter kuzyakov 2010 kuzyakov et al 2000 it should also be noted that nue from research plots is often greater than production fields under same practices due to difference in scales of fertilizer and irrigation management practices cassman et al 2002 dobermann 2007 results in cotton in 2020 were notable due to the higher yields observed in the ni treatment relative to both irrigation treatments for cotton dry periods prompting irrigation occurred before the peak bloom table 5 precipitation was frequent in the early growth stages july and was supplemented by one irrigation to maintain appropriate soil moisture irrigation in july and subsequent rainfall in august may have also leached more n below the root zone in the irrigated treatments resulting in lower yields additionally in 2020 two major rainfall events due to tropical storms were observed in the following weeks 2020 08 03 to 2020 08 09 and 8 13 2020 to 8 16 2020 the growth stage between the first square and first flower is moderately sensitive to water stress but higher moisture more than crop water demand may result in excess vegetative growth and impacts cotton yield chalise et al 2022 ermanis et al 2021 perry and barnes 2015 additionally cotton yields were potentially impacted due to higher rainfall in the flowering stage which may lead to flowers and young bolls falling off cetin and basbag 2010 these results suggest the need for irrigation strategies in cotton that are specific to the growth stage of the plant and potential for nutrient leaching instead of soil moisture data alone 4 2 challenges of weather informed irrigation and nutrient management in humid climates with sandy soils sandy soils of the coastal regions adds another layer of complexity to irrigation scheduling due to lower pawc and a higher risk of nutrient leaching davis et al 2003 supplemental irrigation in humid areas controls a narrow range of depletion where the water storage capacity in the soil must be identified more effectively to accommodate the possibility of rainfall as experienced in this study conditions of moisture stress and excess can be separated by as little as a week wi irrigation from this study provides an approach to maximize the soil storage reserve for rainfall after irrigation by leveraging weather forecast information to improve wue without impacting the yields however the effects of irrigation can be seen in a dry or a normal condition under humid climates the study years were relatively wet years which may have impacted the results in this study the wi under some n treatments didn t perform better than ni and fi treatment this has been observed in previous studies where irrigation decision using short term weather forecast did not account the longer outlooks beyond the weather forecast window and thus resulted in either excess or limited soil moisture conditions cai et al 2011 previous studies have incorporated weather forecast data into irrigation schedules and have proven that it can potentially reduce irrigation water through improved wue cai et al 2011 gowing and ejieji 2001 lorite et al 2015 wang and cai 2009 however in this field study it was observed that the accuracy of soil moisture storage to accommodate rain is highly influenced by the forecast accuracy of the qpf in accuracy and uncertainties in short term forecasts to maintain appropriate soil moisture conditions remains a key challenge as we focus on farmers as end users of climate forecasting services in humid areas one of the significant challenges in using wi irrigation is the resolution of the available forecast data the nws weather forecast information is available at a 2 5 km grid the pop is calculated based on the likelihood that precipitation will occur and the expected areal extent of that precipitation convective rainfall in humid subtropical climates often results in high intensity rainfall over very small spatial extents that are difficult to capture in observational data and gridded meteorological products schroeer et al 2018 farming decisions using pop for irrigation could lead to the application of irrigation followed shortly by rainfall or the delay of irrigation even when no rainfall ultimately occurs for instance the study area received little to no rainfall between july 10th 2020 to july 27th 2020 as the depletion increased precipitation with pop of 0 43 was expected to bring 12 7 mm of rain according to the forecast on july 21st 2020 and irrigation was postponed however the study area didn t receive any rainfall as a result irrigation as triggered on 23rd july 2020 on the other hand july 30th 2020 we applied irrigation because the pop was 0 18 however on the following day area received 6 35 mm of rainfall one possible solution employed in recent studies includes various machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of the short term weather forecast frnda et al 2022 rasp and lerch 2018 additionally studies have shown that use of longer time frame forecast may be helpful against seasonal droughts jamal et al 2019 4 3 practical implications of forecast data for irrigation management the use of forecast data poses a challenge regarding practical implications because of the accuracy of precipitation with lead time even at a well equipped research station with efficient field management incorporating weather forecasts is a challenge for implementation at our study location field managers must prepare for irrigation move irrigation pipes and enter application depths the day before irrigating to ensure that an event could be initiated the following morning therefore research and recommendations particularly methods that prescribe frequent application of small irrigation depths or variable rate irrigation must account for the wide range of labor required across different types of irrigation systems and longer planning at the farm level to accommodate any misfunction of irrigating equipment and other field challenges additionally studies using the forecasts for irrigation scheduling must account for intra day changes in forecasted precipitation this is especially challenging for farmers during peak growing seasons as a delay of just one day could lead to detrimental depletion levels moreover the forecasted depth of precipitation was often underpredicted for high precipitation events resulting in over irrigation water logging and surface runoff for example the weather forecast predicted 5 33 mm of rainfall on 48 h lead time 7 36 mm on 24 h lead time and 12 7 mm on the day of 6th august 2020 however the study area received 41 9 mm of rainfall that day similarly on 3rd august 22 3 mm of precipitation was predicted 24 h in advance and increased to 25 4 mm on the day of the event but the study area received 38 1 mm zhu and pi 2014 also found significantly lower amounts of predicted heavy precipitation for 3 day or extended forecasts this creates a challenge in identifying the adequate water storage capacity of the soil for rainfall which is essential for humid regions and sandy soils given potential inaccuracies in forecasted rainfall growers using supplemental irrigation should be aware of the different impacts of excess or limited soil moisture throughout the growing season for instance many crops are less sensitive to water stress in early growth stages soil moisture depletion can be greater during early growth stages to avoid excess water and vertical nitrogen movement but should be avoided during later growth stages when crops become more sensitive to water stress even if rainfall is expected in any case precision fertilization strategies such as split applications or fertigation will be beneficial in reducing the risk and volume of nitrogen lost through leaching additional research efforts are needed to make weather informed precision irrigation beneficial and practical for growers research in precision irrigation in humid climates should include weather forecasts to better understand the tradeoffs between yield and irrigation inputs in particular research that quantifies the impacts of over and under irrigation on yields profitability and environmental impacts across different growing stages could support dynamic irrigation strategies that have a higher likelihood of maintaining optimal soil moisture levels in the face of imperfect weather forecasts future studies would focus on combining both short term and long term forecast in a field study climatic variations such as enso could be helpful to predict the frequency of tropical storms which could guide the longer outlook for irrigation additionally the accuracy of weather forecast should be tested before the growing season and the correction factors could be developed at regional scales using machine learning techniques and regional climatic data 5 conclusions irrigation management is complicated in humid regions due to both moisture stress and excess conditions prevailing over a short period of time additionally water stress is more prevalent due to lower water holding capacity of sandy soils which are more prone to n leaching under excess moisture conditions this study quantified the impacts of using short term weather forecasts in two years of field trials for corn and cotton in humid climates under sandy soils a split plot experiment was used to assess yield nue and wue under three irrigation no irrigation weather informed and full irrigation and four nitrogen treatments our weather informed irrigation strategy was based on a novel approach that integrates probabilistic rainfall forecasts with soil moisture sensor data to avoid conditions of excess or depleted soil moisture the yield varied significantly among n rates but not under irrigation treatments nue in corn was significantly different between wi irrigation at 180 and 270 kg n ha 1 for cotton the results in each year varied due to the amount of precipitation and irrigation with respect to crop stage financial analysis suggest that yield benefits associated with forecast informed irrigation outweigh fuel costs even though relatively favorable rainfall conditions in our study years led to good ni yields one challenge in successfully using forecast data for irrigation is the accuracy of predicted irrigation amounts additional irrigation research that incorporates forecast accuracy could lead to further benefits it is suggested that precision irrigation studies providing irrigation scheduling advice schedule advise must account for the practical need for growers to manage irrigation along with wide range of competing demands for their time and attention nevertheless our results suggest that forecast informed irrigation can improve yields nue and wue in humid climates where variable rainfall conditions and sandy soils make irrigation scheduling a challenge declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

8952,secondary salinization has long been reported in the roxo irrigation district rid southern portugal due to the use of saline prone irrigation water and the existence of poorly structured soils this study assessed the soil water and salt budgets in nine commercial orchards located in the rid using the multiple ion chemistry module available in the hydrus 1d model during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons the studied crops were almond olive citrus orange mandarin and clementine and pomegranate the model successfully simulated soil water contents measured in the different fields but there was a clear underestimation of the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract ece in some locations while simulations of the sodium adsorption ratio sar were generally acceptable modeling errors were mostly associated with missing information on fertigation events rather than related to the effects of irrigation water quality the water and salt balances were also computed for the 1979 2020 period considering the probability of non exceedance of salt accumulation during this period the risk of salinity build up was high to very high for the very dry years in most fields except in the citrus sites the factors influencing the salt accumulation were the irrigation strategy the seasonal irrigation and rainfall depths the duration of the crop growth period the rainfall distribution in the late and non growing stages the soil drainage conditions and the irrigation water quality for the current climate conditions and irrigation water quality the risk of soil salinity levels affecting crop development and yields was found to be minor this means that despite salts tended to accumulate in the rootzone over a season under current conditions the salinity stress did not reach harmful levels for plants only in two of the study sites there was a need to promote salt leaching hence this study shows that soil salinization risks in the study area are low but for given locations during drier seasons there is a need for tailored irrigation solutions aimed at the conservation of soil and water resources keywords irrigation water management hydrus 1d leaching needs salinity build up solute stress data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agriculture and irrigation in particular is responsible for 70 of all freshwater withdrawals in the world and 90 in the least developed regions unesco 2020 with diverted water farmers can fulfill crop water requirements diversify crop production increase food production meet the growing food demand ensure food stability and increase their income and prosperity of rural areas pereira et al 2002 2009 the downside is the widespread degradation of soil and water resources particularly in water scarce regions due to poor management of irrigation water in these regions mostly characterized by arid to dry sub humid climates secondary human induced soil salinization assumes major relevancy with recent estimates of 30 of irrigated lands as salt affected hopmans et al 2021 secondary salinization is mainly caused by poor management of irrigation water including the use of non conventional water resources and of fertilizers and other chemicals and changes in land use rhoades et al 1992 hoffman and shalhevet 2007 pereira et al 2014 minhas et al 2020 factors contributing to secondary salinization consist of high evapotranspiration and soil and groundwater conditions favoring soil water dynamics and solute transport i e climate conditions soil properties irrigation method and associated soil and water management practices hopmans et al 2021 irrigation management strategies to cope with soil salinity were recently reviewed by minhas et al 2020 where the need to prevent the build up of salts in the root zone to levels that limit the root water uptake were emphasized controlling the salt balances in the soil water system by preventing accumulation in the root zone and minimizing the damaging effect of salinity on crop transpiration and soil evaporation for optimal crop growth were duly considered the current study develops in the roxo irrigation district rid in alentejo southern portugal and follows a companion paper dealing with assessing irrigation and determining the crop coefficients to support irrigation scheduling ramos et al 2023 both studies result from the need to increase knowledge on the water use and environmental impacts in the orchard systems currently dominating the landscape in alentejo the region has faced significant changes in the landscape over the last decade where the traditional crops irrigated and rainfed cereals were abruptly replaced by orchards mainly olive and almond these orchards mostly are of high 300 trees ha 1 and very high density 1500 trees ha 1 which require high and precise input factors paço et al 2019 while some studies already exist to address improved crop water use paço et al 2019 2014 conceição et al 2017 santos 2018 and prevention of non point source pollution due to fertigation practices cameira et al 2014 these stress the need to further gain knowledge on crop water use that control environmental impacts the rid has also been historically the center of soil salinization problems in southern portugal resulting from the semi arid climate the use of poor quality irrigation water and the use of soils for irrigation with deficient drainage conditions namely stagnic luvisols and planosols martins et al 2005 alexandre et al 2018 while irrigation water quality problems were attenuated after 2016 with the connection of the rid to the alqueva system deficient soil drainage conditions remained the same in most of the area on the other hand soil salinization risks may have likely been aggravated due to less percolating water resulting from a decreasing rainfall trend as reported by portela et al 2020 ramos et al 2023 in the companion paper evaluated the water use and water balance resulting from current irrigation management in some of the most representative orchard systems in the rid using the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 2005 and the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012 that study showed that mild water deficit irrigation schedules are viable which can lead to significant water savings in the region the study further made clear the need for better training farmers relative to irrigation water management including in their computing skills and that support on the various orchard management issues namely relative to water and fertility become available thus contributing to better facing global change challenges this companion paper now focuses on the quantitative evaluation of soil salinization risks resulting from current irrigation management and climate conditions the major ion chemistry module in the hydrus 1d software package šimůnek et al 2008 2016 was the tool of choice the reasons for choosing this model were various firstly the capacity of hydrus 1d for considering multicomponent solute transport being able to describe the subsurface transport of multiple ions that may mutually interact create various complex species compete for sorption sites and or precipitate or dissolve šimůnek et al 2016 thus showing a more realistic approach to the salinization problem than the simple modeling of the electrical conductivity of the soil solution as a non reactive tracer secondly the capacity of defining the atmospheric boundary conditions in the case study sites by adopting the estimated potential transpiration and soil evaporation fluxes from the companion paper ramos et al 2023 allowing thus a more accurate representation of evapotranspiration fluxes in rather complex agricultural systems thirdly the extensive calibration validation of model simulations already performed in the region gonçalves et al 2006 ramos et al 2011 as well as its use for assessment of soil salinization and sodification risks under different scenarios related to irrigation management water quality and climate change ramos et al 2019 lastly the considerable number of simulations needed for this study with hydrus 1d providing fast and reliable estimates of soil salinization and sodification risks in the long term despite using a simpler representation of the modeling system when compared with the two and three dimensional hydrus versions ramos et al 2019 the objectives of this study therefore were i to calibrate and validate the hydrus 1d model in various almond olive citrus orange clementine mandarin and pomegranate orchards of alentejo using field data of the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons ii to evaluate the components of the soil water and salt balances relative to current irrigation management and iii to quantify soil salinization risks and leaching needs in the different study sites in a climate variability context using data from 1979 to 2020 as such this study complements the one reported in the companion paper ramos et al 2013 by further contributing to improve irrigation water use in the alentejo region considering the sustainability of local soil and water resources and response of local production systems to climate variability 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the case studies this study was carried out in nine commercial orchards located in the rid montes velhos aljustrel portugal and developed from january 1st 2019 to december 31st 2020 fig 1 the climate is semi arid with the mean air temperature ranging from 9 8ºc in january to 23 1ºc in august the

1979 2020 the weather data during the study period 2019 2020 were collected at the local meteorological station fig 2 shows the information of interest to this study namely the daily values of the eto and rainfall the studied crops were almond prunus amygdalus batsch olive olea europaea l citrus citrus spp and pomegranate punica granatum l covering the most representative perennials grown in the region in five locations orchards were on ridges mostly trapezoidal shaped with 0 25 0 70 m height and 1 2 1 6 m wide at the top and 2 3 2 8 m wide at the bottom table 1 presents the main characteristics of the selected orchards including location crop variety crop density training system and soil type the main physical and chemical properties of soils in the nine study sites are given in table 2 the methodologies used in the respective soil analyses can be found in the companion paper ramos et al 2023 in all sites the groundwater table was below 5 5 m orchards were drip irrigated with irrigation scheduling decided by farmers and following standard practices in the region daily irrigation depths averaged between 2 7 mm in the orange p6 and 7 4 mm in the mandarin p8 fields the season irrigation depths averaged 658 mm in almond 320 mm in olive 830 mm in citrus and 791 mm in pomegranate soil water contents were continuously monitored at depths of 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 m using enviropro mt capacitance probes mait industries australia installed in the crop rows as detailed in the companion paper ramos et al 2023 the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract ece was periodically measured in disturbed soil samples collected below emitters u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 at depths of 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 and 0 6 0 8 m using an auger two locations per site the electrical conductivity of irrigation water eciw was periodically monitored in the rid irrigation channel with values averaging 0 72 ds m 1 which contrast with the previous range of values 1 05 1 67 ds m 1 measured in the rdi channels between 2003 and 2006 martins et al 2005 before the rdi system was connected to the alqueva system the concentration of ca2 mg2 na and k in the irrigation water averaged 2 10 2 50 2 32 and 0 05 mmol c l 1 respectively 2 2 modeling approach 2 2 1 model description the hydrus 1d software package šimůnek et al 2016 was used to numerically simulate one dimensional water flow and solute transport in variably saturated porous media by solving the richards and fickian based convection dispersion equations respectively as follows 1 θ t z k h h z 1 s h z t 2 θ c k t ρ c k t z θ d c k z q c k z where θ is the volumetric soil water content l3l 3 t is time t z is the vertical space coordinate l h is the soil matric potential or pressure

respectively ρ is the soil bulk density ml 3 q is the volumetric flux density lt 1 d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2t 1 and subscript k represents the major cations present in our study na ca2 mg2 and k in this study the major ion chemistry module was used for the computation of solute transport šimůnek and suarez 1997 šimůnek et al 2013 and no passive or active uptake of soil cations by plants was considered the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties were described using the van genuchten mualem functional relationships mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 3 s e h θ h θ r θ s θ r

lt 1 α l 1 and η are empirical shape parameters l is a pore connectivity tortuosity parameter and m 1 1 η the sink term s in the flow equation was computed according to the macroscopic approach introduced by feddes et al 1978 where the potential root water uptake rate i e the potential crop transpiration rate tc is distributed over the root zone and reduced due to the presence of depth varying water and salinity stressors skaggs et al 2006b šimůnek and hopmans 2009 the water stress response function was defined according to feddes et al 1978 in which root water uptake is at the potential rate when h is between h2 and h3 drops off linearly when h h2 or h h3 and becomes zero when h h4 or h h1 subscripts 1 4 denote different threshold pressure heads the salinity stress response function was defined in terms of the osmotic head hϕ according to maas 1990 this stress response function requires two parameters i e the osmotic head threshold value hϕ threshold corresponding to the value of hϕ above which root water uptake occurs without a reduction and the slope s which determines the root water uptake decline per a unit decrease in the osmotic head below the threshold crop salinity tolerance data for the maas 1990 function is usually tabulated in terms of the soil electrical conductivity of the saturation paste extract ece ayers and westcot 1985 maas 1990 minhas et al 2020 the conversion of the respective soil electrical conductivity threshold ece threshold and slope values to osmotic heads was carried out following ramos et al 2011 the effects of the water and salinity stresses were further assumed to be multiplicative van genuchten 1987 the partition of solutes between the liquid and solid phases in the fickian based convection dispersion equation was described using exchange equations between the major cations ca2 mg2 na and k and respective gapon selectivity or exchange coefficients white and zelazny šimůnek and suarez šimůnek et al 1986 1997

and magnesium calcium and sodium and calcium and potassium respectively in the liquid ca2 mg2 na k and solid phases ca 2 mg 2 na k this approach allows simulating aqueous complexation salt precipitation dissolution and cation exchange reactions the cation exchange capacity cec is assumed as constant given by the sum of the exchangeable cations ca 2 mg 2 na k and independent of ph šimůnek et al 2013 precipitation dissolution reactions consider multicomponent kinetic expressions which include both forward and back reactions the pitzer expressions are adopted for computing single ion activities šimůnek et al 2013 the electrical conductivity of the soil solution ecsw is determined from individual anions and cations following mcneal et al 1970 while the sodium adsorption ratio sar is computed from the simulated soluble na ca2 mg2 concentrations according to the u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 guidelines successful applications of the major ion chemistry module or unsatchem module available in hydrus 1d can be found in gonçalves et al 2006 ramos et al 2011 rasouli et al 2013 raij et al 2016 and phogat et al 2020 2 2 2 model setup in each of the nine studied orchards the soil domain was defined as a one dimensional column with 2 0 m depth discretized using 201 nodes the soil was then divided into 4 layers with depths of 0 0 0 2 m 0 2 0 4 m 0 4 0 6 m 0 6 2 0 m which were like this defined for calibration purposes for the layers where information was available table 2 the soil hydraulic parameters were initially obtained by fitting the mualem van genucthen model to measured soil hydraulic data for the deeper layers in which direct measurements of soil hydraulic properties were unavailable due to stoniness or inadequate soil moisture conditions for sampling undisturbed soil cores the soil hydraulic parameters were defined using the pedotransfer functions ptfs in ramos et al 2013 2014 soil dispersivity λ values were initially estimated using ptfs in gonçalves et al 2002 the initial soil water contents were defined according to the measured data from capacitance probes at each location and depth at the beginning of each season the initial concentration of ca2 mg2 na and k in the liquid and solid phases were those presented in table 3 concentrations of soluble cations na ca2 mg2 and k were measured in the soil solution collected from saturation extracts using atomic absorption spectrophotometry exchangeable cations ca 2 mg 2 na k were determined with the bascomb method bascomb 1964 using a solution of bacl2 triethanolamine at ph 8 1 the concentration of cl was calculated to maintain the charge balance while the cation exchange capacity cec was calculated from the sum of ion exchange species the gapon exchange constants were then computed from the initial solute conditions in the liquid and solid phases following eqs 5 through 7 the upper boundary conditions were determined by the potential crop transpiration tc and soil evaporation es rates and the irrigation rainfall and concentration fluxes tc and es values were computed daily following the dual crop coefficient dual kc approach allen et al 1998 2005 using the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012 this was fundamental for the accurate definition of surface boundary evapotranspiration fluxes in the study cases due to the great complexity associated with orchard systems in these systems surfaces are heterogenous the soil is incompletely covered and differences in the planting density canopy height training system interrow management and irrigation management influence the amount of energy available for both the transpiration and soil evaporation processes all details on the application of the dual kc approach to the nine orchards can be found in the companion paper ramos et al 2023 root depth was defined according to observations varying from 0 8 m in p3 and p5 to 1 0 m in the remaining sites the bottom boundary condition was specified as free drainage tc reductions due to water stress were computed for almond with the parameters defined in phogat et al 2018 h1 10 cm h2 25 cm h3 500 to 800 cm and h4 15 000 cm the salinity stress was computed with hϕ threshold 1193 89 cm and s 0 02499 based on data tabulated in minhas et al 2020 for olive the water stress was computed with the parameters defined in egea et al 2016 h1 10 cm h2 25 cm h3 3000 to 5000 cm and h4 18 000 cm the salinity stress used hϕ threshold 3099 17 cm and s 0 02099 for the cv arbequina and picual minhas et al 2020 and hϕ threshold 1579 94 cm and s 0 02187 for cv cobrançosa marin et al 1985 for citrus h1 10 cm h2 25 cm h3 200 to 1000 cm and h4 18 000 cm šimůnek et al 2013 and hϕ threshold 1346 31 cm and s 0 02099 minhas et al 2020 for pomegranate the tc reduction parameters due to water and salinity stresses were set identically to olive thus assuming similar tolerance to drought and saline conditions 2 2 3 model calibration and validation the hydrus 1d model was calibrated for each of the studied orchards using the 2019 dataset and validation was performed using the calibrated parameters with the 2020 dataset calibration procedures followed a two step approach and were initiated by minimizing the deviation between measured and simulated soil moisture data in a first step the soil hydraulic parameters θs α and η were obtained through inverse modeling of daily soil water content data following šimunek and van genuchten 1996 the weighting coefficients used for the different soil water content data points in the objective function to be minimized were all assumed to be 1 since the observation errors of the measurements were unknown ramos et al 2006 gonzález et al 2015 the θr was not modified as this parameter usually has little influence on simulated time series of soil water contents and soil pressure heads gonzález et al 2015 jacques et al 2002 šimůnek et al 1998 the ks was also not modified being set to values measured in the laboratory when available or to the estimates provided by ptfs this option was considered more realistic than the ks values resulting from the inverse modeling procedure the connectivity tortuosity l parameter was set to 0 5 following mualem 1976 the statistical indicators used to evaluate the goodness of fit between observed and predicted soil water contents were those recommended by pereira et al 2015 the regression coefficient of the linear regression through the origin b0 the coefficient of determination r2 of the ordinary least squares regression between observed and predicted values the mean absolute error mae the root mean square error rmse the ratio of the rmse to the mean of the observed data nrmse the percent bias of estimation pbias and the modeling efficiency nse afterward soil moisture simulations were considered adequate the soil dispersivity values and the gapon exchange constants were calibrated in a second step following a trial and error procedure i e by manually adjusting the referred parameters one at a time until deviations between model simulations and field measurements of the ece and sar were minimized the simulated ecsw data were converted to ece for comparison with field data using the ecsw ece 2 ratio u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 because field data were only periodically available providing insufficient data for some of the statistical indicators referred to above the goodness of fit indicators used for assessing model performance were b0 mae rmse and nrmse this limitation of data was mainly due to the sars cov 2 outbreak and restrictions imposed on traveling during the study period the full description of the statistical indicators can be found in moriasi et al 2007 legates and mccabe 1999 and nash and sutcliffe 1970 in general b0 equal to 1 indicates that the predicted values are statistically identical to field measurements r2 values close to 1 show that the model can explain the variance of the observations mae rmse and nrmse values close to zero indicate that estimation errors are small and model predictions are good in general rmse mae the degree to which the rmse value exceeds the mae is usually a good indicator of the presence and extent of outliers or the variance of the differences between the modeled and observed values which were here useful to assess considering that soil salinity can have other sources e g fertigation than that evaluated in the modeling approach irrigation water quality pbias values close to zero describe accurate model simulations while negative or positive values indicate over or under estimation bias respectively nse values close to 1 mean that model predictions are good since the residuals variance is much smaller than the observed data variance contrarily if nse 0 the observed mean is a better indicator than model predictions 2 3 irrigation scenarios soil salinization risks were accessed considering the inter annual variability of weather conditions the crop growing period and irrigation needs during the period 1979 2020 the previously calibrated model parameters were naturally adopted as well as other settings soil salinization risks were determined from the cumulative data of the daily salt balance sb kg ha 1 computed for each season as follows wilcox and resch 1963 bresler et al 1982 8 sb tsc iw tsc rain tsc dw 0 64 d iw ec iw d rain ec rain d dw ec dw 10 where tsciw tscrain and tscdw are the total salt content of irrigation water rainfall and drainage water kg ha 1 respectively diw drain and ddw are the depth of irrigation water rainfall and drainage water mm respectively and eciw ecrain and ecdw are the electrical conductivity of irrigation water rainfall and drainage water ds m 1 respectively the ecrain was 0 10 ds m 1 and this value was used for all salinity simulations it is slightly below the value of 0 12 ds m 1 used by phogat et al 2018 the salt balance was computed for the 0 0 1 5 m soil layer positive values refer to salt accumulation in the root zone layer while negative values refer to the dominance of leaching from the same layer for these scenarios simulations were consecutively run from the beginning of one growing season to the day prior to the beginning of the next season so that leaching in the non growing period could all be accounted for in the salt balance for each case study results of the salt balance for the period 1979 2020 were then sorted in ascending order and the years corresponding to the probabilities of 20 50 80 and 95 for non exceedance were identified for simplification purposes these were assumed to represent humid normal dry and very dry years respectively for each study site the era5 weather reanalysis data were used hersbach et al 2018 this dataset provides several gridded meteorological parameters with an hourly timestep and a resolution of 0 28125 31 km the variables used were air and dewpoint temperatures at 2 m height k the u longitude and v latitude components of wind velocity at 10 m u10 m s 1 solar radiation at the surface j m 2 and total rainfall m weather hourly data was then converted to daily values the u10 data was also converted to wind speed at 2 m height u2 the daily eto was computed using the fao pm equation allen et al 1978 the adequateness of using era5 for computing the incoming solar radiation and eto has been positively evaluated in a previous study by paredes et al 2021 the surface boundary conditions in hydrus 1d i e the daily tp and ep values as well as irrigation schedules for the 1979 2020 period were again estimated using the dual kc approach and the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012 details on the computation of crop irrigation needs for scenario analysis are provided in ramos et al 2023 which include the assumed initial conditions measured values in 2019 the growing degree days gdd observed during the monitored period 2019 2020 and used for defining the dates of each year s crop growth stages the settings for irrigation triggering imposing a crop water stress of 5 and the pre defined irrigation depths per event 5 mm mild deficit irrigation schedules were always adopted considering the limited water availability in the region and that all studied crops can endure water deficit during most stages of their growth period without significantly affecting yields grattan et al 2006 garcía tejero et al 2012 2018 volschenk 2020 rallo et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parametrization table 4 presents the model parameters calibrated during the 2019 growing season the soil hydraulic parameters were in the range of those proposed by ramos et al 2013 for the different texture classes of soils in portugal likewise the soil dispersivity values found some agreement with those in gonçalves et al 2002 and vanderborght and vereecken 2007 lastly the gapon exchange constants of medium textured soils were close to values in ramos et al 2011 and phogat 2018 while for fine textured soils they were closer to values in rasouli et al 2013 the kca k in the ridge layer 0 0 0 6 m of site p7 was the exception which value was found to be higher than those reported in the literature reasons for that result may be related with the soil characteristics 3 2 model performance fig 3 shows as an example the measured soil water contents at 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 m depths and the respective hydrus 1d simulated values in the p1 orchard during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons the figures also include the depths and dates of irrigation and rainfall events for orchards p2 to p8 the corresponding information can be found in ramos et al 2023 or in the supplementary material figs s1 to s8 similar to most of other case studies soil water contents in p1 showed large variations along both growing seasons with higher values usually observed during the rainfall season and lower values in the dry summer season when they were maintained only by drip irrigation the exceptions were the citrus orchards p6 p8 wherein soil water contents during the summer season were also generally high due to excessive applications of irrigation water as reported in the companion study ramos et al 2023 in all plots variations of soil water contents were further larger at shallower depths than in the deeper layers as a result of the small water depths used root water uptake water infiltration and redistribution table 5 presents the statistical indicators used to evaluate the goodness of fit between measured and simulated soil water contents in all case studies for 2019 the calibration year the regression coefficients b0 were all close to the 1 0 target ranging from 0 975 p4 to 1 011 p8 indicating that the simulated values were close to the observed ones the value of r2 varied from 0 440 in p4 to 0 844 in p6 showing that the model could generally explain most of the variance of the observed data the errors of the estimates were always small with rmse 0 022 cm3 cm 3 and nrmse 0 156 the pbias values were also quite small 1 149 pbias 0 845 with no particular over or under estimation trend in simulating the measured data lastly the nse values were relatively high ranging from 0 435 p4 to 0 844 p6 thus indicating that the variance of the residuals was smaller than the measured data variance for 2020 the validation year the goodness of fit indicators showed generally the same trend and a range of values similar to those observed at calibration the worst statistics were obtained in p2 while the best indicators were in p8 deviations between measured and simulated soil water content data may be explained by limitations in field data collection and representation of the three dimensional drip irrigation system using a one dimensional approach dabach et al 2013 ramos et al 2012 kandelous et al 2011 the goodness of fit between measured and simulated ece values was less good than that for soil moisture table 6 this was expected as solute transport simulations depend upon i soil moisture simulations ii the assumed relationship for converting simulated ecsw into ece which is relatively straightforward but subjected to uncertainty skaggs et al 2006a and iii the less efficient trial and error calibration procedure used for solute transport parameters when compared with the inverse modeling approach used for soil hydraulic parameters as shown in fig 4 there was an overall underestimation of the measured ece namely for higher values however that underestimation was not observed for sar and thus for individual cations in the soil solution na ca2 and mg2 where no tendency of under or over prediction was noticed and pairwise comparisons of measurements and simulations aligned along the bisector of the scatterplot fig 4 the largest errors in ece simulations were found in p1 p7 and p8 in 2019 and p9 in both seasons rmse 1 375 ds m 1 these correspond to plots where soil salinity reached the highest values although causes were sometimes difficult to understand ramos et al 2023 thus the differences between mae and rmse values were significant indicating the presence of probable outliers table 6 in p1 soil salinity was attributed to fertigation events performed in 2019 with effects on soil salinity likely being transient and not noticed in 2020 in p7 and p8 soil salinity peaked only in december 2019 i e oddly during the rainfall season with causes likely associated with unknown substances applied to anticipate delay the maturation of fruits close to harvest farmers are often reluctant to provide information on fertilizers and phytopharmaceutical products applied to their crops but related events show that the larger errors found in p1 p7 and p8 were related to causes other than poor modeling of the effects of irrigation water quality on soil salinity such as missing information about fertigation events in p9 in addition to the above mentioned causes the poor drainage conditions of the planosol soil may have not been well represented in the simulation domain particularly at the bottom depths as such for the analysis that follows one should consider that the salinity build up due to fertigation events is not represented but nonetheless has some expression particularly in intensive production orchards still the overall performance of the model was considered appropriate for the analysis to follow 3 3 assessment of irrigation practices in the studied orchards table 7 presents the soil water balance computed by hydrus 1d for all case studies during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons as results are similar to those from simdualkc reported in the companion paper ramos et al 2003 and the latter were extensively discussed only a brief overview of hydrus 1d main results and of fundamental differences relative to the various plots are given herein in almond fields p1 and p2 irrigation fulfilled most of the crop water needs during the irrigation season full irrigation or mild water deficits were noticed along the two growing seasons with root water uptake reductions ranging from 1 2 to 10 3 of tc values salinity stress was only found in p2 2019 causing a mere reduction of tc values of 3 contrarily to reported results in ramos et al 2023 no salinity stress was observed in p1 during the 2019 growing season thus reflecting higher tc act and lower percolation values when compared with that reported simdualkc study this was mainly due to the substantial conceptual differences between the two modeling approaches used for estimating the salinity stress hydrus 1d simulations were not able to capture the impact of fertigation on soil salinity levels particularly for this plot and season producing thus some underestimation of its effects simdualkc uses directly the ece measured in the field to compute the salinity stress and is therefore able to include such stress even if causes are not known in all other fields simdualkc and hydrus 1d results were comparable in olive fields p3 p4 and p5 as typical of these systems moderate water deficits were observed along the seasons with root water uptake reductions of 4 0 23 6 of tc values in citrus fields p6 p7 and p8 large percolation values 218 937 mm were found due to excess irrigation and poor water management in the pomegranate field p9 no significant root water uptake reductions were noticed due to the high tolerance of this crop to drought and salinity the salt balance table 8 was much associated with irrigation management in each case study and seasonal rainfall in 2019 when season rainfall was below the mean average 337 mm there was a general trend for salt accumulation in the soil profile which was higher in almond 2 20 2 52 tonnes ha 1 than in olive 1 08 1 55 tonnes ha 1 or pomegranate 1 51 tonnes ha 1 fields the exceptions were the citrus fields 0 45 to 7 34 tonnes ha 1 where leaching dominated due to excessive irrigation in 2020 when seasonal rainfall was above the mean annual average 484 mm the salt balance became mostly negative in all plots indicating leaching of salts by the end of the simulation period december exceptions were again noticed but this time in the olive fields where a small salt accumulation trend was noticed 0 41 0 79 tonnes ha 1 because deficit irrigation is practiced in these fields thus percolation during the irrigation season is minimized the amount of rainfall occurring in 2020 from october to december was not enough to leach salts away from the root zone layer results are thus in accordance with dudley et al 2008 and ramos et al 2019 referring to the risk of salt accumulation associated to deficit irrigation schedules 3 4 salinity build up and climate variability table 9 presents the salt balance for the years corresponding to the probabilities of 20 50 80 and 95 for non exceedance i e representing the humid normal dry and very dry years determined with the simulations in the 1979 2020 period however factors influencing soil salinization were more diverse than meteorological conditions soil salinization risks were found to be site specific and depending upon the seasonal irrigation and rainfall depths the dates defining the crop stages the rainfall distribution in the late and non growing stages and the soil drainage conditions i e the soil hydraulic properties despite being an influencing factor irrigation water quality was assumed constant throughout the 42 years of simulation and a mild deficit irrigation strategy was also assumed for all crops and the simulation period in the p1 almond field crop irrigation requirements ranged from 320 to 560 mm during the 1979 2020 period while net rainfall varied from 279 to 705 mm the resulting salt balance ranged from 1 47 2 54 tonnes ha 1 with negative values computed by the end of the season in 7 years fig 5 thus p1 showed a probability of salt accumulation of 83 3 over a season 35 out of 42 years in p2 irrigation requirements ranged from 335 to 575 mm net rainfall was close to p1 with small differences resulting from soil infiltration characteristics and runoff the salt balance ranged from 2 44 2 77 tonnes ha 1 and the probability of salt accumulation over a season was 76 2 hence the risk of salinity build up was slightly smaller in p2 than in p1 but still high the simulated ece reached higher values in p2 than in p1 which agrees with the monitoring period 2019 2020 almond is sensitive to salinity having an ece threshold of 1 5 ds m 1 and a reduction of 19 in the growth rate for a unit increase in salinity beyond the threshold minhas et al 2020 salinity levels above the threshold during the cropping season could have a serious impact on growth and yields in p1 ece values higher than the ece threshold were predicted for the cases equaling or topping the probability of 95 for non exceedance i e very dry years in p1 ece ece threshold occurred only for a short period by late september and below the 0 5 m soil depth in p2 ece ece threshold for cases with a probability for non exceedance 80 i e dry and very dry years occurring by after the end of august also at soil depths below 0 5 m because by then on both cases almond nuts are supposed to have been already harvested controlling soil salinity by adding a leaching fraction to irrigation depths seems unneeded however in p2 and for seasons following very dry periods pre season leaching may be required in these very dry seasons ece values were maintained above the ece threshold at deeper depths increasing the risk of affecting the next season s flowering period which occurs very early in the year february rainfall during autumn and early winter may not be enough to leach salts accumulated during the previous irrigation season with the risk of affecting the flowering stage simulations showed that applying 10 20 mm as pre season irrigation i e at the end of january was enough to drop ece values below the ece threshold in the rootzone layer by the beginning of the next growing season meanwhile it should be assumed that when simulating drip irrigation in orchards using a two dimensional model the computed leaching may be less effective yang et al 2019 therefore the required pre season leaching irrigation depths may be higher than those predicted above nevertheless transient state models such as hydrus 1d give a more accurate estimate of leaching needs than the traditional approach documented for example in ayers and westcot 1985 which many researchers believe to be conservative corwin et al 2007 letey et al 2011 corwin and grattan 2018 in olive fields irrigation needs ranged from 315 to 625 mm in p3 285 630 mm in p4 and 175 410 mm in p5 during the 1979 2020 period the salt balance varied from 2 44 2 77 tonnes ha 1 in p3 4 09 2 53 tonnes ha 1 in p4 and 1 0 1 60 tonnes ha 1 in p5 fig 5 the probability of salt accumulation over a season was high in all fields reaching 83 3 in p3 64 3 in p4 and 81 0 in p5 despite such high risks soil salinity in p3 and p5 never reached harmful levels for plants in these two locations olive varieties arbequina and picual are moderately tolerant to salinity and leaching during the rainfall period was always sufficient to control soil salinity levels even in the dry seasons in p4 the olive variety cobrançosa is more sensitive to soil salinity at least when trees are young marin et al 1995 the ece ece threshold occurred only for cases with probability for non exceedance 97 i e 2 years in these years adopting a leaching fraction by the beginning of september may be necessary to control soil salinity levels for the year with the highest salt accumulation 2019 applying a leaching fraction of 30 after september 1st was sufficient to maintain ece ece threshold i e adding 1 5 mm per event thus 40 mm of total irrigation water in citrus fields irrigation requirements were relatively similar between the case studies varying from 175 mm to 435 mm during the 1979 2020 period the salt balance ranged from 2 96 1 13 tonnes ha 1 in p6 5 69 to 0 47 tonnes ha 1 in p7 and 4 69 0 35 tonnes ha 1 in p8 fig 5 the probability of salt accumulation over a season was only 28 7 in p6 and 7 1 in p8 in p7 the accumulation of salts at the end of a season was never detected the ece ece threshold condition never occurred in any of these sites during the analyzed period the citrus plots showed to have better drainage conditions than the almond and olive plots the ridges where crops were planted likely played a decisive role on improving soil water flow conditions since the original soil profiles usually present poor drainage conditions lastly irrigation needs for pomegranate p9 ranged from 290 to 575 mm the salt balance varied from 3 01 1 79 tonnes ha 1 fig 5 and the probability of salt accumulation over a season was 64 3 the simulations show that the crop was never affected by salinity stress as the tolerance threshold is relatively high ece threshold 4 ds m 1 moreover drainage conditions were improved as trees were also placed on ridges otherwise crop development would likely be seriously affected by the poor drainage conditions of the planosol soil to summarize most of the study soils have high to very high risk tendency for accumulating salts from irrigation water over a growing season namely during very dry years however for current climate conditions adopting a mild deficit irrigation strategy and wide ridges the risk of soil salinity levels reaching harmful levels to plants was very low this conclusion was determined using a one dimensional modeling approach but in the study area orchards are drip irrigated which implies caution in interpreting simulation results in fact salts tend to accumulate below the drippers from where they are then transported downwards and sideways depending on irrigation volumes and frequency rainfall evapotranspiration rates and soil hydraulic properties keller and bliesner 1990 one dimensional representations of these systems can lead to inaccurate results in the short term with the salinity build up and the salinity stress in the root zone being most likely overestimated hanson et al 2008 but such overestimation is not relevant in the current study since risks were as referred above very low furthermore the salt balances were computed by the end of the leaching season when salts are more evenly distributed in the soil profile with their accumulation extending further than just below the drip emitter thus approximating a one dimensional solution ramos et al 2012 2019 4 conclusions the current paper presents and discusses soil salinization risks in nine commercial orchards in the alentejo region southern portugal the crops addressed are almond olive citrus orange clementine and mandarin and pomegranate soil water dynamics and salt transport were simulated in all cases using the major ion chemistry module in hydrus 1d the model successfully simulated soil water contents measured in the different fields along two growing seasons with small rmse values ranging from 0 011 to 0 023 cm3 cm 3 simulations of the ece and sar were more challenging returning rmse values varying from 0 291 to 2 322 ds m 1 and from 0 389 and 1 355 mmol c l 1 0 5 respectively there was a clear underestimation of the ece in some fields but simulations of sar were quite acceptable this shows that modeling errors were not associated with misrepresentations of the effects of irrigation water quality on soil salinity but with other causes like missing information about fertigation events soil salinization risks in the study sites were much associated with irrigation management and were site specific factors like irrigation strategy seasonal irrigation and rainfall depths the crop growth season the rainfall distribution in the late and non growing stages the soil drainage conditions and the irrigation water quality were found to influence salt accumulation in the soil profile along the season the risk of salt accumulation was high to very high for the very dry years in most studied orchards with only the citrus plots being less prone to salinity build up due to more favorable drainage conditions in the root zone domain and or in the soil ridge where trees were planted nonetheless for current climate conditions and irrigation water quality the risk of soil salinity levels affecting crop development and yields was found to be minor rainfall leaching is sufficient to promote salt leaching during most seasons only in two of the study sites it would be necessary to promote salt leaching during drier seasons following strategies that differed between locations notwithstanding soil salinization risks can certainly be aggravated by fertilization management which could not be simulated but was found to have a significant impact on soil salinity levels in some of the study sites climate change which projections for the region include a significant decrease in rainfall thus of the natural leaching process may further aggravate soil salinization risks in the study areas which should be object of future studies adopting a continuous

8952,secondary salinization has long been reported in the roxo irrigation district rid southern portugal due to the use of saline prone irrigation water and the existence of poorly structured soils this study assessed the soil water and salt budgets in nine commercial orchards located in the rid using the multiple ion chemistry module available in the hydrus 1d model during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons the studied crops were almond olive citrus orange mandarin and clementine and pomegranate the model successfully simulated soil water contents measured in the different fields but there was a clear underestimation of the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract ece in some locations while simulations of the sodium adsorption ratio sar were generally acceptable modeling errors were mostly associated with missing information on fertigation events rather than related to the effects of irrigation water quality the water and salt balances were also computed for the 1979 2020 period considering the probability of non exceedance of salt accumulation during this period the risk of salinity build up was high to very high for the very dry years in most fields except in the citrus sites the factors influencing the salt accumulation were the irrigation strategy the seasonal irrigation and rainfall depths the duration of the crop growth period the rainfall distribution in the late and non growing stages the soil drainage conditions and the irrigation water quality for the current climate conditions and irrigation water quality the risk of soil salinity levels affecting crop development and yields was found to be minor this means that despite salts tended to accumulate in the rootzone over a season under current conditions the salinity stress did not reach harmful levels for plants only in two of the study sites there was a need to promote salt leaching hence this study shows that soil salinization risks in the study area are low but for given locations during drier seasons there is a need for tailored irrigation solutions aimed at the conservation of soil and water resources keywords irrigation water management hydrus 1d leaching needs salinity build up solute stress data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agriculture and irrigation in particular is responsible for 70 of all freshwater withdrawals in the world and 90 in the least developed regions unesco 2020 with diverted water farmers can fulfill crop water requirements diversify crop production increase food production meet the growing food demand ensure food stability and increase their income and prosperity of rural areas pereira et al 2002 2009 the downside is the widespread degradation of soil and water resources particularly in water scarce regions due to poor management of irrigation water in these regions mostly characterized by arid to dry sub humid climates secondary human induced soil salinization assumes major relevancy with recent estimates of 30 of irrigated lands as salt affected hopmans et al 2021 secondary salinization is mainly caused by poor management of irrigation water including the use of non conventional water resources and of fertilizers and other chemicals and changes in land use rhoades et al 1992 hoffman and shalhevet 2007 pereira et al 2014 minhas et al 2020 factors contributing to secondary salinization consist of high evapotranspiration and soil and groundwater conditions favoring soil water dynamics and solute transport i e climate conditions soil properties irrigation method and associated soil and water management practices hopmans et al 2021 irrigation management strategies to cope with soil salinity were recently reviewed by minhas et al 2020 where the need to prevent the build up of salts in the root zone to levels that limit the root water uptake were emphasized controlling the salt balances in the soil water system by preventing accumulation in the root zone and minimizing the damaging effect of salinity on crop transpiration and soil evaporation for optimal crop growth were duly considered the current study develops in the roxo irrigation district rid in alentejo southern portugal and follows a companion paper dealing with assessing irrigation and determining the crop coefficients to support irrigation scheduling ramos et al 2023 both studies result from the need to increase knowledge on the water use and environmental impacts in the orchard systems currently dominating the landscape in alentejo the region has faced significant changes in the landscape over the last decade where the traditional crops irrigated and rainfed cereals were abruptly replaced by orchards mainly olive and almond these orchards mostly are of high 300 trees ha 1 and very high density 1500 trees ha 1 which require high and precise input factors paço et al 2019 while some studies already exist to address improved crop water use paço et al 2019 2014 conceição et al 2017 santos 2018 and prevention of non point source pollution due to fertigation practices cameira et al 2014 these stress the need to further gain knowledge on crop water use that control environmental impacts the rid has also been historically the center of soil salinization problems in southern portugal resulting from the semi arid climate the use of poor quality irrigation water and the use of soils for irrigation with deficient drainage conditions namely stagnic luvisols and planosols martins et al 2005 alexandre et al 2018 while irrigation water quality problems were attenuated after 2016 with the connection of the rid to the alqueva system deficient soil drainage conditions remained the same in most of the area on the other hand soil salinization risks may have likely been aggravated due to less percolating water resulting from a decreasing rainfall trend as reported by portela et al 2020 ramos et al 2023 in the companion paper evaluated the water use and water balance resulting from current irrigation management in some of the most representative orchard systems in the rid using the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 2005 and the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012 that study showed that mild water deficit irrigation schedules are viable which can lead to significant water savings in the region the study further made clear the need for better training farmers relative to irrigation water management including in their computing skills and that support on the various orchard management issues namely relative to water and fertility become available thus contributing to better facing global change challenges this companion paper now focuses on the quantitative evaluation of soil salinization risks resulting from current irrigation management and climate conditions the major ion chemistry module in the hydrus 1d software package šimůnek et al 2008 2016 was the tool of choice the reasons for choosing this model were various firstly the capacity of hydrus 1d for considering multicomponent solute transport being able to describe the subsurface transport of multiple ions that may mutually interact create various complex species compete for sorption sites and or precipitate or dissolve šimůnek et al 2016 thus showing a more realistic approach to the salinization problem than the simple modeling of the electrical conductivity of the soil solution as a non reactive tracer secondly the capacity of defining the atmospheric boundary conditions in the case study sites by adopting the estimated potential transpiration and soil evaporation fluxes from the companion paper ramos et al 2023 allowing thus a more accurate representation of evapotranspiration fluxes in rather complex agricultural systems thirdly the extensive calibration validation of model simulations already performed in the region gonçalves et al 2006 ramos et al 2011 as well as its use for assessment of soil salinization and sodification risks under different scenarios related to irrigation management water quality and climate change ramos et al 2019 lastly the considerable number of simulations needed for this study with hydrus 1d providing fast and reliable estimates of soil salinization and sodification risks in the long term despite using a simpler representation of the modeling system when compared with the two and three dimensional hydrus versions ramos et al 2019 the objectives of this study therefore were i to calibrate and validate the hydrus 1d model in various almond olive citrus orange clementine mandarin and pomegranate orchards of alentejo using field data of the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons ii to evaluate the components of the soil water and salt balances relative to current irrigation management and iii to quantify soil salinization risks and leaching needs in the different study sites in a climate variability context using data from 1979 to 2020 as such this study complements the one reported in the companion paper ramos et al 2013 by further contributing to improve irrigation water use in the alentejo region considering the sustainability of local soil and water resources and response of local production systems to climate variability 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the case studies this study was carried out in nine commercial orchards located in the rid montes

range of values 1 05 1 67 ds m 1 measured in the rdi channels between 2003 and 2006 martins et al 2005 before the rdi system was connected to the alqueva system the concentration of ca2 mg2 na and k

varying water and salinity stressors skaggs et al 2006b šimůnek and hopmans 2009 the water stress response function was defined according to feddes et al 1978 in which root water uptake is at the potential rate when h is between h2 and h3 drops off linearly when h h2 or h h3 and becomes zero when h h4 or h h1 subscripts 1 4 denote different threshold pressure heads the salinity stress response function was defined in terms of the osmotic head hϕ according to maas 1990 this stress response function requires two parameters i e the osmotic head threshold value hϕ threshold corresponding to the value of hϕ above which root water uptake occurs without a reduction and the slope s which determines the root water uptake decline per a unit decrease in the osmotic head below the threshold crop salinity tolerance data for the maas 1990 function is usually tabulated in terms of the soil electrical conductivity of the saturation paste extract ece ayers and westcot 1985 maas 1990 minhas et al 2020 the conversion of the respective soil electrical conductivity threshold ece threshold and slope values to osmotic heads was carried out following ramos et al 2011 the effects of the water and salinity stresses were further assumed to be multiplicative van genuchten 1987 the partition of solutes between the liquid and solid phases in the fickian based convection dispersion equation was described using exchange equations between the major cations ca2 mg2 na and k and respective gapon selectivity or exchange coefficients white and zelazny šimůnek and suarez šimůnek et al 1986 1997

and magnesium calcium and sodium and calcium and potassium respectively in the liquid ca2 mg2 na k and solid phases ca 2 mg 2 na k this approach allows simulating aqueous complexation salt precipitation dissolution and cation exchange reactions the cation exchange capacity cec is assumed as constant given by the sum of the exchangeable cations ca 2 mg 2 na k and independent of ph šimůnek et al 2013 precipitation dissolution reactions consider multicomponent kinetic expressions which include both forward and back reactions the pitzer expressions are adopted for computing single ion activities šimůnek et al 2013 the electrical conductivity of the soil solution ecsw is determined from individual anions and cations following mcneal et al 1970 while the sodium adsorption ratio sar is computed from the simulated soluble na ca2 mg2 concentrations according to the u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 guidelines successful applications of the major ion chemistry module or unsatchem module available in hydrus 1d can be found in gonçalves et al 2006 ramos et al 2011 rasouli et al 2013 raij et al 2016 and phogat et al 2020 2 2 2 model setup in each of the nine studied orchards the soil domain was defined as a one dimensional column with 2 0 m depth discretized using 201 nodes the soil was then divided into 4 layers with depths of 0 0 0 2 m 0 2 0 4 m 0 4 0 6 m 0 6 2 0 m which were like this defined for calibration purposes for the layers where information was available table 2 the soil hydraulic parameters were initially obtained by fitting the mualem van genucthen model to measured soil hydraulic data for the deeper layers in which direct measurements of soil hydraulic properties were unavailable due to stoniness or inadequate soil moisture conditions for sampling undisturbed soil cores the soil hydraulic parameters were defined using the pedotransfer functions ptfs in ramos et al 2013 2014 soil dispersivity λ values were initially estimated using ptfs in gonçalves et al 2002 the initial soil water contents were defined according to the measured data from capacitance probes at each location and depth at the beginning of each season the initial concentration of ca2 mg2 na and k in the liquid and solid phases were those presented in table 3 concentrations of soluble cations na ca2 mg2 and k were measured in the soil solution collected from saturation extracts using atomic absorption spectrophotometry exchangeable cations ca 2 mg 2 na k were determined with the bascomb method bascomb 1964 using a solution of bacl2 triethanolamine at ph 8 1 the concentration of cl was calculated to maintain the charge balance while the cation exchange capacity cec was calculated from the sum of ion exchange species the gapon exchange constants were then computed from the initial solute conditions in the liquid and solid phases following eqs 5 through 7 the upper boundary conditions were determined by the potential crop transpiration tc and soil evaporation es rates and the irrigation rainfall and concentration fluxes tc and es values were computed daily following the dual crop coefficient dual kc approach allen et al 1998 2005 using the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012 this was fundamental for the accurate definition of surface boundary evapotranspiration fluxes in the study cases due to the great complexity associated with orchard systems in these systems surfaces are heterogenous the soil is incompletely covered and differences in the planting density canopy height training system interrow management and irrigation management influence the amount of energy available for both the transpiration and soil evaporation processes all details on the application of the dual kc approach to the nine orchards can be found in the companion paper ramos et al 2023 root depth was defined according to observations varying from 0 8 m in p3 and p5 to 1 0 m in the remaining sites the bottom boundary condition was specified as free drainage tc reductions due to water stress were computed for almond with the parameters defined in phogat et al 2018 h1 10 cm h2 25 cm h3 500 to 800 cm and h4 15 000 cm the salinity stress was computed with hϕ threshold 1193 89 cm and s 0 02499 based on data tabulated in minhas et al 2020 for olive the water stress was computed with the parameters defined in egea et al 2016 h1 10 cm h2 25 cm h3 3000 to 5000 cm and h4 18 000 cm the salinity stress used hϕ threshold 3099 17 cm and s 0 02099 for the cv arbequina and picual minhas et al 2020 and hϕ threshold 1579 94 cm and s 0 02187 for cv cobrançosa marin et al 1985 for citrus h1 10 cm h2 25 cm h3 200 to 1000 cm and h4 18 000 cm šimůnek et al 2013 and hϕ threshold 1346 31 cm and s 0 02099 minhas et al 2020 for pomegranate the tc reduction parameters due to water and salinity stresses were set identically to olive thus assuming similar tolerance to drought and saline conditions 2 2 3 model calibration and validation the hydrus 1d model was calibrated for each of the studied orchards using the 2019 dataset and validation was performed using the calibrated parameters with the 2020 dataset calibration procedures followed a two step approach and were initiated by minimizing the deviation between measured and simulated soil moisture data in a first step the soil hydraulic parameters θs α and η were obtained through inverse modeling of daily soil water content data following šimunek and van genuchten 1996 the weighting coefficients used for the different soil water content data points in the objective function to be minimized were all assumed to be 1 since the observation errors of the measurements were unknown ramos et al 2006 gonzález et al 2015 the θr was not modified as this parameter usually has little influence on simulated time series of soil water contents and soil pressure heads gonzález et al 2015 jacques et al 2002 šimůnek et al 1998 the ks was also not modified being set to values measured in the laboratory when available or to the estimates provided by ptfs this option was considered more realistic than the ks values resulting from the inverse modeling procedure the connectivity tortuosity l parameter was set to 0 5 following mualem 1976 the statistical indicators used to evaluate the goodness of fit between observed and predicted soil water contents were those recommended by pereira et al 2015 the regression coefficient of the linear regression through the origin b0 the coefficient of determination r2 of the ordinary least squares regression between observed and predicted values the mean absolute error mae the root mean square error rmse the ratio of the rmse to the mean of the observed data nrmse the percent bias of estimation pbias and the modeling efficiency nse afterward soil moisture simulations were considered adequate the soil dispersivity values and the gapon exchange constants were calibrated in a second step following a trial and error procedure i e by manually adjusting the referred parameters one at a time until deviations between model simulations and field measurements of the ece and sar were minimized the simulated ecsw data were converted to ece for comparison with field data using the ecsw ece 2 ratio u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 because field data were only periodically available providing insufficient data for some of the statistical indicators referred to above the goodness of fit indicators used for assessing model performance were b0 mae rmse and nrmse this limitation of data was mainly due to the sars cov 2 outbreak and restrictions imposed on traveling during the study period the full description of the statistical indicators can be found in moriasi et al 2007 legates and mccabe 1999 and nash and sutcliffe 1970 in general b0 equal to 1 indicates that the predicted values are statistically identical to field measurements r2 values close to 1 show that the model can explain the variance of the observations mae rmse and nrmse values close to zero indicate that estimation errors are small and model predictions are good in general rmse mae the degree to which the rmse value exceeds the mae is usually a good indicator of the presence and extent of outliers or the variance of the differences between the modeled and observed values which were here useful to assess considering that soil salinity can have other sources e g fertigation than that evaluated in the modeling approach irrigation water quality pbias values close to zero describe accurate model simulations while negative or positive values indicate over or under estimation bias respectively nse values close to 1 mean that model predictions are good since the residuals variance is much smaller than the observed data variance contrarily if nse 0 the observed mean is a better indicator than model predictions 2 3 irrigation scenarios soil salinization risks were accessed considering the inter annual variability of weather conditions the crop growing period and irrigation needs during the period 1979 2020 the previously calibrated model parameters were naturally adopted as well as other settings soil salinization risks were determined from the cumulative data of the daily salt balance sb kg ha 1 computed for each season as follows wilcox and resch 1963 bresler et al 1982 8 sb tsc iw tsc rain tsc dw 0 64 d iw ec iw d rain ec rain d dw ec dw 10 where tsciw tscrain and tscdw are the total salt content of irrigation water rainfall and drainage water kg ha 1 respectively diw drain and ddw are the depth of irrigation water rainfall and drainage water mm respectively and eciw ecrain and ecdw are the electrical conductivity of irrigation water rainfall and drainage water ds m 1 respectively the ecrain was 0 10 ds m 1 and this value was used for all salinity simulations it is slightly below the value of 0 12 ds m 1 used by phogat et al 2018 the salt balance was computed for the 0 0 1 5 m soil layer positive values refer to salt accumulation in the root zone layer while negative values refer to the dominance of leaching from the same layer for these scenarios simulations were consecutively run from the beginning of one growing season to the day prior to the beginning of the next season so that leaching in the non growing period could all be accounted for in the salt balance for each case study results of the salt balance for the period 1979 2020 were then sorted in ascending order and the years corresponding to the probabilities of 20 50 80 and 95 for non exceedance were identified for simplification purposes these were assumed to represent humid normal dry and very dry years respectively for each study site the era5 weather reanalysis data were used hersbach et al 2018 this dataset provides several gridded meteorological parameters with an hourly timestep and a resolution of 0 28125 31 km the variables used were air and dewpoint temperatures at 2 m height k the u longitude and v latitude components of wind velocity at 10 m u10 m s 1 solar radiation at the surface j m 2 and total rainfall m weather hourly data was then converted to daily values the u10 data was also converted to wind speed at 2 m height u2 the daily eto was computed using the fao pm equation allen et al 1978 the adequateness of using era5 for computing the incoming solar radiation and eto has been positively evaluated in a previous study by paredes et al 2021 the surface boundary conditions in hydrus 1d i e the daily tp and ep values as well as irrigation schedules for the 1979 2020 period were again estimated using the dual kc approach and the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012 details on the computation of crop irrigation needs for scenario analysis are provided in ramos et al 2023 which include the assumed initial conditions measured values in 2019 the growing degree days gdd observed during the monitored period 2019 2020 and used for defining the dates of each year s crop growth stages the settings for irrigation triggering imposing a crop water stress of 5 and the pre defined irrigation depths per event 5 mm mild deficit irrigation schedules were always adopted considering the limited water availability in the region and that all studied crops can endure water deficit during most stages of their growth period without significantly affecting yields grattan et al 2006 garcía tejero et al 2012 2018 volschenk 2020 rallo et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parametrization table 4 presents the model parameters calibrated during the 2019 growing season the soil hydraulic parameters were in the range of those proposed by ramos et al 2013 for the different texture classes of soils in portugal likewise the soil dispersivity values found some agreement with those in gonçalves et al 2002 and vanderborght and vereecken 2007 lastly the gapon exchange constants of medium textured soils were close to values in ramos et al 2011 and phogat 2018 while for fine textured soils they were closer to values in rasouli et al 2013 the kca k in the ridge layer 0 0 0 6 m of site p7 was the exception which value was found to be higher than those reported in the literature reasons for that result may be related with the soil characteristics 3 2 model performance fig 3 shows as an example the measured soil water contents at 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 m depths and the respective hydrus 1d simulated values in the p1 orchard during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons the figures also include the depths and dates of irrigation and rainfall events for orchards p2 to p8 the corresponding information can be found in ramos et al 2023 or in the supplementary material figs s1 to s8 similar to most of other case studies soil water contents in p1 showed large variations along both growing seasons with higher values usually observed during the rainfall season and lower values in the dry summer season when they were maintained only by drip irrigation the exceptions were the citrus orchards p6 p8 wherein soil water contents during the summer season were also generally high due to excessive applications of irrigation water as reported in the companion study ramos et al 2023 in all plots variations of soil water contents were further larger at shallower depths than in the deeper layers as a result of the small water depths used root water uptake water infiltration and redistribution table 5 presents the statistical indicators used to evaluate the goodness of fit between measured and simulated soil water contents in all case studies for 2019 the calibration year the regression coefficients b0 were all close to the 1 0 target ranging from 0 975 p4 to 1 011 p8 indicating that the simulated values were close to the observed ones the value of r2 varied from 0 440 in p4 to 0 844 in p6 showing that the model could generally explain most of the variance of the observed data the errors of the estimates were always small with rmse 0 022 cm3 cm 3 and nrmse 0 156 the pbias values were also quite small 1 149 pbias 0 845 with no particular over or under estimation trend in simulating the measured data lastly the nse values were relatively high ranging from 0 435 p4 to 0 844 p6 thus indicating that the variance of the residuals was smaller than the measured data variance for 2020 the validation year the goodness of fit indicators showed generally the same trend and a range of values similar to those observed at calibration the worst statistics were obtained in p2 while the best indicators were in p8 deviations between measured and simulated soil water content data may be explained by limitations in field data collection and representation of the three dimensional drip irrigation system using a one dimensional approach dabach et al 2013 ramos et al 2012 kandelous et al 2011 the goodness of fit between measured and simulated ece values was less good than that for soil moisture table 6 this was expected as solute transport simulations depend upon i soil moisture simulations ii the assumed relationship for converting simulated ecsw into ece which is relatively straightforward but subjected to uncertainty skaggs et al 2006a and iii the less efficient trial and error calibration procedure used for solute transport parameters when compared with the inverse modeling approach used for soil hydraulic parameters as shown in fig 4 there was an overall underestimation of the measured ece namely for higher values however that underestimation was not observed for sar and thus for individual cations in the soil solution na ca2 and mg2 where no tendency of under or over prediction was noticed and pairwise comparisons of measurements and simulations aligned along the bisector of the scatterplot fig 4 the largest errors in ece simulations were found in p1 p7 and p8 in 2019 and p9 in both seasons rmse 1 375 ds m 1 these correspond to plots where soil salinity reached the highest values although causes were sometimes difficult to understand ramos et al 2023 thus the differences between mae and rmse values were significant indicating the presence of probable outliers table 6 in p1 soil salinity was attributed to fertigation events performed in 2019 with effects on soil salinity likely being transient and not noticed in 2020 in p7 and p8 soil salinity peaked only in december 2019 i e oddly during the rainfall season with causes likely associated with unknown substances applied to anticipate delay the maturation of fruits close to harvest farmers are often reluctant to provide information on fertilizers and phytopharmaceutical products applied to their crops but related events show that the larger errors found in p1 p7 and p8 were related to causes other than poor modeling of the effects of irrigation water quality on soil salinity such as missing information about fertigation events in p9 in addition to the above mentioned causes the poor drainage conditions of the planosol soil may have not been well represented in the simulation domain particularly at the bottom depths as such for the analysis that follows one should consider that the salinity build up due to fertigation events is not represented but nonetheless has some expression particularly in intensive production orchards still the overall performance of the model was considered appropriate for the analysis to follow 3 3 assessment of irrigation practices in the studied orchards table 7 presents the soil water balance computed by hydrus 1d for all case studies during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons as results are similar to those from simdualkc reported in the companion paper ramos et al 2003 and the latter were extensively discussed only a brief overview of hydrus 1d main results and of fundamental differences relative to the various plots are given herein in almond fields p1 and p2 irrigation fulfilled most of the crop water needs during the irrigation season full irrigation or mild water deficits were noticed along the two growing seasons with root water uptake reductions ranging from 1 2 to 10 3 of tc values salinity stress was only found in p2 2019 causing a mere reduction of tc values of 3 contrarily to reported results in ramos et al 2023 no salinity stress was observed in p1 during the 2019 growing season thus reflecting higher tc act and lower percolation values when compared with that reported simdualkc study this was mainly due to the substantial conceptual differences between the two modeling approaches used for estimating the salinity stress hydrus 1d simulations were not able to capture the impact of fertigation on soil salinity levels particularly for this plot and season producing thus some underestimation of its effects simdualkc uses directly the ece measured in the field to compute the salinity stress and is therefore able to include such stress even if causes are not known in all other fields simdualkc and hydrus 1d results were comparable in olive fields p3 p4 and p5 as typical of these systems moderate water deficits were observed along the seasons with root water uptake reductions of 4 0 23 6 of tc values in citrus fields p6 p7 and p8 large percolation values 218 937 mm were found due to excess irrigation and poor water management in the pomegranate field p9 no significant root water uptake reductions were noticed due to the high tolerance of this crop to drought and salinity the salt balance table 8 was much associated with irrigation management in each case study and seasonal rainfall in 2019 when season rainfall was below the mean average 337 mm there was a general trend for salt accumulation in the soil profile which was higher in almond 2 20 2 52 tonnes ha 1 than in olive 1 08 1 55 tonnes ha 1 or pomegranate 1 51 tonnes ha 1 fields the exceptions were the citrus fields 0 45 to 7 34 tonnes ha 1 where leaching dominated due to excessive irrigation in 2020 when seasonal rainfall was above the mean annual average 484 mm the salt balance became mostly negative in all plots indicating leaching of salts by the end of the simulation period december exceptions were again noticed but this time in the olive fields where a small salt accumulation trend was noticed 0 41 0 79 tonnes ha 1 because deficit irrigation is practiced in these fields thus percolation during the irrigation season is minimized the amount of rainfall occurring in 2020 from october to december was not enough to leach salts away from the root zone layer results are thus in accordance with dudley et al 2008 and ramos et al 2019 referring to the risk of salt accumulation associated to deficit irrigation schedules 3 4 salinity build up and climate variability table 9 presents the salt balance for the years corresponding to the probabilities of 20 50 80 and 95 for non exceedance i e representing the humid normal dry and very dry years determined with the simulations in the 1979 2020 period however factors influencing soil salinization were more diverse than meteorological conditions soil salinization risks were found to be site specific and depending upon the seasonal irrigation and rainfall depths the dates defining the crop stages the rainfall distribution in the late and non growing stages and the soil drainage conditions i e the soil hydraulic properties despite being an influencing factor irrigation water quality was assumed constant throughout the 42 years of simulation and a mild deficit irrigation strategy was also assumed for all crops and the simulation period in the p1 almond field crop irrigation requirements ranged from 320 to 560 mm during the 1979 2020 period while net rainfall varied from 279 to 705 mm the resulting salt balance ranged from 1 47 2 54 tonnes ha 1 with negative values computed by the end of the season in 7 years fig 5 thus p1 showed a probability of salt accumulation of 83 3 over a season 35 out of 42 years in p2 irrigation requirements ranged from 335 to 575 mm net rainfall was close to p1 with small differences resulting from soil infiltration characteristics and runoff the salt balance ranged from 2 44 2 77 tonnes ha 1 and the probability of salt accumulation over a season was 76 2 hence the risk of salinity build up was slightly smaller in p2 than in p1 but still high the simulated ece reached higher values in p2 than in p1 which agrees with the monitoring period 2019 2020 almond is sensitive to salinity having an ece threshold of 1 5 ds m 1 and a reduction of 19 in the growth rate for a unit increase in salinity beyond the threshold minhas et al 2020 salinity levels above the threshold during the cropping season could have a serious impact on growth and yields in p1 ece values higher than the ece threshold were predicted for the cases equaling or topping the probability of 95 for non exceedance i e very dry years in p1 ece ece threshold occurred only for a short period by late september and below the 0 5 m soil depth in p2 ece ece threshold for cases with a probability for non exceedance 80 i e dry and very dry years occurring by after the end of august also at soil depths below 0 5 m because by then on both cases almond nuts are supposed to have been already harvested controlling soil salinity by adding a leaching fraction to irrigation depths seems unneeded however in p2 and for seasons following very dry periods pre season leaching may be required in these very dry seasons ece values were maintained above the ece threshold at deeper depths increasing the risk of affecting the next season s flowering period which occurs very early in the year february rainfall during autumn and early winter may not be enough to leach salts accumulated during the previous irrigation season with the risk of affecting the flowering stage simulations showed that applying 10 20 mm as pre season irrigation i e at the end of january was enough to drop ece values below the ece threshold in the rootzone layer by the beginning of the next growing season meanwhile it should be assumed that when simulating drip irrigation in orchards using a two dimensional model the computed leaching may be less effective yang et al 2019 therefore the required pre season leaching irrigation depths may be higher than those predicted above nevertheless transient state models such as hydrus 1d give a more accurate estimate of leaching needs than the traditional approach documented for example in ayers and westcot 1985 which many researchers believe to be conservative corwin et al 2007 letey et al 2011 corwin and grattan 2018 in olive fields irrigation needs ranged from 315 to 625 mm in p3 285 630 mm in p4 and 175 410 mm in p5 during the 1979 2020 period the salt balance varied from 2 44 2 77 tonnes ha 1 in p3 4 09 2 53 tonnes ha 1 in p4 and 1 0 1 60 tonnes ha 1 in p5 fig 5 the probability of salt accumulation over a season was high in all fields reaching 83 3 in p3 64 3 in p4 and 81 0 in p5 despite such high risks soil salinity in p3 and p5 never reached harmful levels for plants in these two locations olive varieties arbequina and picual are moderately tolerant to salinity and leaching during the rainfall period was always sufficient to control soil salinity levels even in the dry seasons in p4 the olive variety cobrançosa is more sensitive to soil salinity at least when trees are young marin et al 1995 the ece ece threshold occurred only for cases with probability for non exceedance 97 i e 2 years in these years adopting a leaching fraction by the beginning of september may be necessary to control soil salinity levels for the year with the highest salt accumulation 2019 applying a leaching fraction of 30 after september 1st was sufficient to maintain ece ece threshold i e adding 1 5 mm per event thus 40 mm of total irrigation water in citrus fields irrigation requirements were relatively similar between the case studies varying from 175 mm to 435 mm during the 1979 2020 period the salt balance ranged from 2 96 1 13 tonnes ha 1 in p6 5 69 to 0 47 tonnes ha 1 in p7 and 4 69 0 35 tonnes ha 1 in p8 fig 5 the probability of salt accumulation over a season was only 28 7 in p6 and 7 1 in p8 in p7 the accumulation of salts at the end of a season was never detected the ece ece threshold condition never occurred in any of these sites during the analyzed period the citrus plots showed to have better drainage conditions than the almond and olive plots the ridges where crops were planted likely played a decisive role on improving soil water flow conditions since the original soil profiles usually present poor drainage conditions lastly irrigation needs for pomegranate p9 ranged from 290 to 575 mm the salt balance varied from 3 01 1 79 tonnes ha 1 fig 5 and the probability of salt accumulation over a season was 64 3 the simulations show that the crop was never affected by salinity stress as the tolerance threshold is relatively high ece threshold 4 ds m 1 moreover drainage conditions were improved as trees were also placed on ridges otherwise crop development would likely be seriously affected by the poor drainage conditions of the planosol soil to summarize most of the study soils have high to very high risk tendency for accumulating salts from irrigation water over a growing season namely during very dry years however for current climate conditions adopting a mild deficit irrigation strategy and wide ridges the risk of soil salinity levels reaching harmful levels to plants was very low this conclusion was determined using a one dimensional modeling approach but in the study area orchards are drip irrigated which implies caution in interpreting simulation results in fact salts tend to accumulate below the drippers from where they are then transported downwards and sideways depending on irrigation volumes and frequency rainfall evapotranspiration rates and soil hydraulic properties keller and bliesner 1990 one dimensional representations of these systems can lead to inaccurate results in the short term with the salinity build up and the salinity stress in the root zone being most likely overestimated hanson et al 2008 but such overestimation is not relevant in the current study since risks were as referred above very low furthermore the salt balances were computed by the end of the leaching season when salts are more evenly distributed in the soil profile with their accumulation extending further than just below the drip emitter thus approximating a one dimensional solution ramos et al 2012 2019 4 conclusions the current paper presents and discusses soil salinization risks in nine commercial orchards in the alentejo region southern portugal the crops addressed are almond olive citrus orange clementine and mandarin and pomegranate soil water dynamics and salt transport were simulated in all cases using the major ion chemistry module in hydrus 1d the model successfully simulated soil water contents measured in the different fields along two growing seasons with small rmse values ranging from 0 011 to 0 023 cm3 cm 3 simulations of the ece and sar were more challenging returning rmse values varying from 0 291 to 2 322 ds m 1 and from 0 389 and 1 355 mmol c l 1 0 5 respectively there was a clear underestimation of the ece in some fields but simulations of sar were quite acceptable this shows that modeling errors were not associated with misrepresentations of the effects of irrigation water quality on soil salinity but with other causes like missing information about fertigation events soil salinization risks in the study sites were much associated with irrigation management and were site specific factors like irrigation strategy seasonal irrigation and rainfall depths the crop growth season the rainfall distribution in the late and non growing stages the soil drainage conditions and the irrigation water quality were found to influence salt accumulation in the soil profile along the season the risk of salt accumulation was high to very high for the very dry years in most studied orchards with only the citrus plots being less prone to salinity build up due to more favorable drainage conditions in the root zone domain and or in the soil ridge where trees were planted nonetheless for current climate conditions and irrigation water quality the risk of soil salinity levels affecting crop development and yields was found to be minor rainfall leaching is sufficient to promote salt leaching during most seasons only in two of the study sites it would be necessary to promote salt leaching during drier seasons following strategies that differed between locations notwithstanding soil salinization risks can certainly be aggravated by fertilization management which could not be simulated but was found to have a significant impact on soil salinity levels in some of the study sites climate change which projections for the region include a significant decrease in rainfall thus of the natural leaching process may further aggravate soil salinization risks in the study areas which should be object of future studies adopting a continuous

essential nutrient for crop growth and agricultural production zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2017 kuypers et al 2018 however the high n fertilizer application rates used to achieve high crop yields in greenhouse vegetable production can result in reduced plant uptake due to leaching runoff and volatilization bai et al 2015 and nitrate nitrogen accumulation in the deep soil layer edwards et al 2018 decreasing n use efficiency li et al 2018 in addition excessive n application contributes to environmental issues such as soil acidification chen et al 2014 groundwater pollution zhang et al 2011 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions galloway et al 2008 globally anthropogenic n2o emissions account for 60 of agricultural emissions case et al 2015 the main processes of n2o production include nitrification denitrification and nitrifier denitrification kool et al 2011 case et al 2015 n2o is an intermediate product of nitrification and denitrification processes that depend on soil temperature moisture and mineral n and organic carbon availability fan et al 2021 kuang et al 2021 soil temperature and moisture are considered the most crucial factors regulating soil n2o emissions because they control microbial activity nutrient availability and relevant processes kuang et al 2018 li et al 2020 tao et al 2021 thilakarathna and hernandez ramirez 2021 in addition high nh4 concentration and soil temperature and aerobic conditions soil water filled pore space wfps below or close to 60 favor nitrification case et al 2015 greenhouse vegetable production characterized by high n fertilization frequent irrigation and high soil temperature and moisture tends to promote denitrification de rosa et al 2016 yao et al 2019 which is the primary cause of n2o losses in greenhouse soil accounting for about 30 of total n losses yan et al 2014 du et al 2019 xi et al 2019 frequent irrigation reduces soil aeration affecting soil microbial activity and soil respiration li et al 2020 reduces soil nutrients and augments n2o emissions hence optimizing field management is crucial for alleviating soil n2o emissions and improving n use efficiency integrating water and fertilizer applications under drip irrigation di has been widely used in agriculture hou et al 2021 yan et al 2021 while di can directly and evenly transport chemical fertilizer to the crop root zone reducing soil no3 accumulation the induced oxygen deficiency affects soil microbial respiration and crop growth niu et al 2012 aerated drip irrigation adi is a new irrigation technology based on irrigation fertilization coupling dhungel et al 2012 lei et al 2019 and underground di technology that delivers oxygen or oxygen containing substances to the crop root zone improving soil aeration in the root zone bhattarai et al 2008 zhang et al 2021 the combination of irrigation fertilization aeration could increase soil oxygen content du et al 2019 supplement soil moisture and nutrients and enhance crop yield and water and fertilizer utilization efficiencies du et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 however the impact of coupling irrigation and aeration can increase soil n2o emissions hou et al 2016 chen et al 2019 shang et al 2020 in contrast baram et al 2021 found that irrigation with nanobubble aerated treated wastewater reduced cumulative n2o emissions by 37 in the surface irrigation system and 14 in the subsurface irrigation system soil microbial abundance and enzyme activities urease phosphatase and catalase increase significantly with increasing oxygen content zhang et al 2022 with remarkably higher effects in the root zone than non root zone li et al 2016 zan et al 2021 however the impact of adi and nitrogen doses on soil microbial and enzyme activities is unknown as is the impact of adi on inorganic n availability and the subsequent effect on n2o emissions numerous studies have explored the effects of different aeration volumes aeration measures and water air coupling on crop growth yield and quality with few investigating the effect of adi and nitrogen reduction on soil n2o emissions soil n availability and microbial activity therefore this study aimed to 1 assess how adi affects soil n2o emissions the spatial distribution and accumulation of soil nh4 and no3 and soil microbial activity and 2 explore the relationships between soil moisture soil temperature and soil oxygen content and soil n2o emissions and microbial activity under different irrigation measures and n application rates we also calculated yield scaled n2o emissions and emission factors to determine appropriate

had notably higher values than di 3 6 soil enzyme activity soil urease and catalase activities followed an increasing decreasing trend in the order of fruit enlarging stage harvest stage seeding stage across the growing seasons fig 7 the highest soil urease activities occurred in n200 and n225 for tomato and muskmelon respectively under different irrigation practices in 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 adi increased soil urease activity in 2017 by 2 9 28 6 1 7 14 5 and 3 0 10 3 by 8 0 27 6 2 8 6 3 and 4 6 9 8 in 2017 2018 and by 9 4 25 9 13 0 14 7 and 12 6 18 7 in 2018 at the seeding fruit enlarging and

produced notably higher values than di 4 discussion 4 1 soil n2o emissions soil temperature wfps and no3 are important factors affecting n2o emissions takeda et al 2021 lyu et al 2021 studies have shown a significant positive relationship between n2o and wfps vitale et al 2013 hou et al 2016 shang et al 2020 however we found that soil n2o fluxes decreased with increasing wfps declining to a relatively low level when wfps exceeded 60 fig 8a we attributed this relationship to irrigation and aeration effects frequent irrigation will affect soil moisture and aeration and then have a cumulative effect on soil n2o emissions nitrification increases linearly with increasing soil moisture reaching a maximum at 60 wfps above which n2o emissions increase due to denitrification jamali et al 2015 vitale et al 2013 believed that nitrification is the main source of n2o in soils at 35 60 wfps since nitrification is aeration limited i e decreases with increasing soil water content under saturated conditions mathieu et al 2006 it likely causes soil n2o emissions the aerated drip irrigation adi treatment has large aeration amount and oxygen concentration which improves the soil ammonia monooxygenase activity and nitrification leading to increase soil n2o emissios soil temperatures significantly increased due to the coupling effect of adi and fertilization with a significant positive correlation between n2o emissions and soil temperature fig 8b adi increased oxygen concentration and accelerated soil respiration rate which consumed oxygen and releases energy resulting in high soil temperature li et al 2016 soil mineralization rate and n2o emissions based on nh4 and no3 as nitrification substrates our results indicated that soil no3 concentration increased significantly after n application which was conducive to improving the denitrification rate and promoting n2o emissions as fertilization treatments increased substrates for nitrification and denitrification i e nh4 and no3 promoting soil n2o emissions one study reported a positive exponential correlation between cumulative n2o emissions and n application rates greater than the maximum crop n requirement shang et al 2020 therefore suitable n inputs can reduce n2o emissions our study showed that the combination of n reduction and adi tadi n150 and madi n150 mitigated soil n2o emissions with total n2o cumulative emissions decreasing by 14 5 38 9 in the tomato and muskmelon growing seasons several studies have demonstrated the influence of aerated irrigation on increasing soil n2o emissions hou et al 2016 shang et al 2020 we also found that adi significantly promoted soil n2o emissions relative to di at the same n application rate possibly because the increased oxygen content under adi is more conducive to nitrification increasing with the increasing oxygen content soil n2o flux followed an increasing trend with increasing soil oxygen content fig 8c it may because adi can effectively improve soil aeration soil oxygen diffusion rate of adi was higher than that under di zhu et al 2022 and inhibit the reduction of n2o into n2 in the denitrification process resulting in the increasing of soil n2o emissions lei et al 2019 we hypothesized that aerated soils affect soil n2o emissions via various process controls at different growth stages similar to other reports n fertilizer significantly promoted n2o emissions caused by nitrification during early growth due to the high soil no3 concentrations accompanying the increase in nitrification edwards et al 2018 this peak most likely reflected an increase in ammonia monooxygenase production in response to high nh4 contents after fertilization edwards et al 2018 in the mid and late growing seasons higher soil moisture contents reduced the soil oxygen diffusion rate which is beneficial for denitrification and the two topdressing measures during this period stimulated n2o emissions ben noah and friedman 2016 reported a negative correlation between soil moisture and o2 concentration therefore we suspect that n2o emissions in the mid and late periods were derived mainly from denitrification indicating that nitrification is the main source of n2o emissions during early growth thilakarathna and hernandez ramirez 2021 used isotope labeling methods to separate n2o sources nitrification vs denitrification and found that the denitrification source was the main contributor to total n2o production across all moistures and n addition options further investigation is needed to confirm how adi affects nitrification and denitrification potential and the mechanisms involved 4 2 soil nh4 and no3 soil n mineralization involves the conversion of organic n to inorganic n by soil microorganisms i e bacteria fungi and actinomycetes in this study adi had increased soil nh4 content compared to di because it provided suitable soil temperature moisture status and air conditions for soil microorganisms leading to increased urease secretion to enhance soil n mineralization however compared to di the soil surface layer had lower soil nh4 content under adi due to the rapid transformation to no3 after fertilizer n application under favorable water temperature and air conditions lyu et al 2021 the increased nh4 content increased no3 the primary form of crop n absorption but it is easily lost hu et al 2021 through no3 leaching induced by high frequency irrigation and excessive n fertilizer application in the present study adi significantly increased no3 content in the 0 60 cm soil layer root zone and decreased it in the 60 100 cm soil layer possibly due to the combined irrigation fertilization aeration improving soil moisture and pore structure and thus enhancing the soil s capacity to absorb and fix soluble n ions chen et al 2021 reducing n leaching moreover madi n225 had the highest no3 content at 0 100 cm while madi n150 had 14 6 22 2 lower values across the growing season madi n150 decreased nitrate accumulation and reduced n2o emissions compared with mdi n225 reasonable irrigation fertilization aeration management measures could increase n fertilizer residual amounts in the surface layer 0 20 cm reduce n fertilizer loss and inhibit n fertilizer migration to deep soil we suspect that adi inhibits denitrification and enhances no3 retention for example soil no3 of 0 60 cm concentration increased while soil no3 concentration at harvest stage decreased due to crop absorption no3 availability is more conducive to shoot and root development improving crop productivity briones et al 2003 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 reported that adi significantly promoted plant n absorption and migration to fruits and improved n use efficiency increasing plant n supply and enhancing soil n supply capacity no3 concentrations decreased across the growing season possibly because crop n consumption was higher than n inputs changes in n mineralization or nitrification rates could affect inorganic n availability case et al 2015 but there is limited research in this area further studies should focus on the effect of adi on the functional genes related to n cycling and on isotope labeling to investigate issues such as soil n mineralization rates 4 3 soil microbial activity our results found that adi improved smbc more so in tadi n200 than tdi n250 likely due to the increased substrate supply capacity of soil organic carbon under adi and the higher n fertilizer application inhibited smbc generation tedeschi et al 2020 geisseler and scow s 2014 meta analysis of 107 groups of data from 64 studies worldwide revealed that n fertilizer significantly increased smbc by 15 1 attributed to the increased soil organic carbon content gu et al 2019 stated that soil moisture impacted smbc with similar findings for soil microbial activity and moisture content under spring wheat li et al 2004 we also found that smbc decreased with increasing wfps and increased with increasing soil oxygen content figs 9a and 10a possibly due to the improved soil aeration under adi similar results occurred for smbn figs 9b and 10b critical for transforming soil organic n to inorganic n smbn content reflects c and n fixation and release by soil microorganisms increased soil available n can also contribute to smbn production yin et al 2012 thus we expect that the increased no3 and nh4 contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer after aeration improved smbn in the adi treatments soil enzyme activity is critical in the soil biochemical cycle organic matter and mineral transformation araújo et al 2013 lino et al 2016 in this study soil enzyme activities increased and then decreased during the growing season with the higher nutrient demand of crops mid growth stimulating soil enzyme activity water saturation in the root zone under conventional di reduced soil oxygen diffusion ability and inhibited soil enzyme activity freeman et al 2001 our study also found decreased urease and catalase activities with increasing wfps fig 9c d compared with di adi increased soil urease and catalase activities possibly due to the higher oxygen content fig 10c d furthermore n application significantly improved soil urease and catalase activities subsequently increasing the decomposition and conversion of soil n and organic matter enhancing nutrient supply for plant absorption and utilization 4 4 crop yield ysnes and ef to better estimate the combined effects of adi and fertilization on n2o emissions and crop yields we calculated yield scaled n2o emissions ysnes and emission factors ef table 6 to evaluate the balance between soil n2o emissions and crop productivity kim and giltrap 2017 gu et al 2020 our results showed that both fertilization and irrigation significantly influenced crop yield ysnes and ef while adi significantly increased tomato and muskmelon yields by 1 8 15 5 compared with di it produced 1 7 30 6 and 1 4 35 9 higher cumulative n2o emissions and ef respectively than di tadi n150 and tadi n200 produced higher tomato yields than tadi n250 with 14 5 38 9 and 18 3 40 4 lower ynses in both seasons in particular tadi n150 had greater reductions in ysnes and ef than tdi n200 but no significant difference in tomato yield similarly madi n150 decreased cumulative n2o emissions ysnes and ef compared with mdi n225 while also increasing muskmelon yield by 6 9 overall these findings suggest that decreasing the amount of fertilizer n by two fifths to one third combined with adi can reduce soil n2o emissions improve soil n availability and increase yield 5 conclusions aerated drip irrigation adi and n application significantly affect soil moisture soil temperature oxygen content and microbial activity adi significantly increased soil nh4 and no3 contents by 3 7 51 5 in the 0 60 cm soil layer while decreasing n fertilizer migration to deep soil tomato and muskmelon yields increased by 1 8 15 4 under adi compared with di the combination of n reduction and adi mitigated soil n2o fluxes with cumulative n2o emissions decreasing by 14 5 38 9 under adi n150 obtained lower yield scaled n2o emissions ysnes and emission factors ef than n200 n225 and n250 thus adi accompanied by an appropriate n application rate 150 kg ha 1 could improve soil nh4 and no3 availability and productivity reducing soil n2o

essential nutrient for crop growth and agricultural production zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2017 kuypers et al 2018 however the high n fertilizer application rates used to achieve high crop yields in greenhouse vegetable production can result in reduced plant uptake due to leaching runoff and volatilization bai et al 2015 and nitrate nitrogen accumulation in the deep soil layer edwards et al 2018 decreasing n use efficiency li et al 2018 in addition excessive n application contributes to environmental issues such as soil acidification chen et al 2014 groundwater pollution zhang et al 2011 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions galloway et al 2008 globally anthropogenic n2o emissions account for 60 of agricultural emissions case et al 2015 the main processes of n2o production include nitrification denitrification and nitrifier denitrification kool et al 2011 case et al 2015 n2o is an intermediate product of nitrification and denitrification processes that depend on soil temperature moisture and mineral n and organic carbon availability fan et al 2021 kuang et al 2021 soil temperature and moisture are considered the most crucial factors regulating soil n2o emissions because they control microbial activity nutrient availability and relevant processes kuang et al 2018 li et al 2020 tao et al 2021 thilakarathna and hernandez ramirez 2021 in addition high nh4 concentration and soil temperature and aerobic conditions soil water filled pore space wfps below or close to 60 favor nitrification case et al 2015 greenhouse vegetable production characterized by high n fertilization frequent irrigation and high soil temperature and moisture tends to promote denitrification de rosa et al 2016 yao et al 2019 which is the primary cause of n2o losses in greenhouse soil accounting for about 30 of total n losses yan et al 2014 du et al 2019 xi et al 2019 frequent irrigation reduces soil aeration affecting soil microbial activity and soil respiration li et al 2020 reduces soil nutrients and augments n2o emissions hence optimizing field management is crucial for alleviating soil n2o emissions and improving n use efficiency integrating water and fertilizer applications under drip irrigation di has been widely used in agriculture hou et al 2021 yan et al 2021 while di can directly and evenly transport chemical fertilizer to the crop root zone reducing soil no3 accumulation

zhang et al 2021 the combination of irrigation fertilization aeration could increase soil oxygen content du et al 2019 supplement soil moisture and nutrients and enhance crop yield and water and fertilizer utilization efficiencies du et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 however the impact of coupling irrigation and aeration can increase soil n2o emissions hou et al 2016 chen et al 2019 shang et al 2020 in contrast baram et al 2021 found that irrigation with nanobubble aerated treated wastewater reduced cumulative n2o emissions by 37 in the surface irrigation system and 14 in the subsurface irrigation system soil microbial abundance and enzyme activities urease phosphatase and catalase increase significantly with increasing oxygen content zhang et al 2022 with remarkably higher effects in the root zone than non root zone li et al 2016 zan et al 2021 however the impact of adi and nitrogen doses on soil microbial and enzyme activities is unknown as is the impact of adi on inorganic n availability and the subsequent effect on n2o emissions numerous studies have explored the effects of different aeration volumes aeration measures and water air coupling on crop growth yield and quality with few investigating the effect of adi and nitrogen reduction on soil n2o emissions soil n availability and microbial activity therefore this study aimed to 1 assess how adi affects soil n2o emissions the spatial distribution and accumulation of soil nh4 and no3 and soil microbial activity and 2 explore the relationships between soil moisture soil temperature and soil oxygen content and soil n2o emissions and microbial activity under different irrigation measures and n application rates we also calculated yield scaled n2o emissions and emission factors to determine appropriate

shown a significant positive relationship between n2o and wfps vitale et al 2013 hou et al 2016 shang et al 2020 however we found that soil n2o fluxes decreased with increasing wfps declining to a relatively low level when wfps exceeded 60 fig 8a we attributed this relationship to irrigation and aeration effects frequent irrigation will affect soil moisture and aeration and then have a cumulative effect on soil n2o emissions nitrification increases linearly with increasing soil moisture reaching a maximum at 60 wfps above which n2o emissions increase due to denitrification jamali et al 2015 vitale et al 2013 believed that nitrification is the main source of n2o in soils at 35 60 wfps since nitrification is aeration limited i e decreases with increasing soil water content under saturated conditions mathieu et al 2006 it likely causes soil n2o emissions the aerated drip irrigation adi treatment has large aeration amount and oxygen concentration which improves the soil ammonia monooxygenase activity and nitrification leading to increase soil n2o emissios soil temperatures significantly increased due to the coupling effect of adi and fertilization with a significant positive correlation between n2o emissions and soil temperature fig 8b adi increased oxygen concentration and accelerated soil respiration rate which consumed oxygen and releases energy resulting in high soil temperature li et al 2016 soil mineralization rate and n2o emissions based on nh4 and no3 as nitrification substrates our results indicated that soil no3 concentration increased significantly after n application which was conducive to improving the denitrification rate and promoting n2o emissions as fertilization treatments increased substrates for nitrification and denitrification i e nh4 and no3 promoting soil n2o emissions one study reported a positive exponential correlation between cumulative n2o emissions and n application rates greater than the maximum crop n requirement shang et al 2020 therefore suitable n inputs can reduce n2o emissions our study showed that the combination of n reduction and adi tadi n150 and madi n150 mitigated soil n2o emissions with total n2o cumulative emissions decreasing by 14 5 38 9 in the tomato and muskmelon growing seasons several studies have demonstrated the influence of aerated irrigation on increasing soil n2o emissions hou et al 2016 shang et al 2020 we also found that adi significantly promoted soil n2o emissions relative to di at the same n application rate possibly because the increased oxygen content under adi is more conducive to nitrification increasing with the increasing oxygen content soil n2o flux followed an increasing trend with increasing soil oxygen content fig 8c it may because adi can effectively improve soil aeration soil oxygen diffusion rate of adi was higher than that under di zhu et al 2022 and inhibit the reduction of n2o into n2 in the denitrification process resulting in the increasing of soil n2o emissions lei et al 2019 we hypothesized that aerated soils affect soil n2o emissions via various process controls at different growth stages similar to other reports n fertilizer significantly promoted n2o emissions caused by nitrification during early growth due to the high soil no3 concentrations accompanying the increase in nitrification edwards et al 2018 this peak most likely reflected an increase in ammonia monooxygenase production in response to high nh4 contents after fertilization edwards et al 2018 in the mid and late growing seasons higher soil moisture contents reduced the soil oxygen diffusion rate which is beneficial for denitrification and the two topdressing measures during this period stimulated n2o emissions ben noah and friedman 2016 reported a negative correlation between soil moisture and o2 concentration therefore we suspect that n2o emissions in the mid and late periods were derived mainly from denitrification indicating that nitrification is the main source of n2o emissions during early growth thilakarathna and hernandez ramirez 2021 used isotope labeling methods to separate n2o sources nitrification vs denitrification and found that the denitrification source was the main contributor to total n2o production across all moistures and n addition options further investigation is needed to confirm how adi affects nitrification and denitrification potential and the mechanisms involved 4 2 soil nh4 and no3 soil n mineralization involves the conversion of organic n to inorganic n by soil microorganisms i e bacteria fungi and actinomycetes in this study adi had increased soil nh4 content compared to di because it provided suitable soil temperature moisture status and air conditions for soil microorganisms leading to increased urease secretion to enhance soil n mineralization however compared to di the soil surface layer had lower soil nh4 content under adi due to the rapid transformation to no3 after fertilizer n application under favorable water temperature and air conditions lyu et al 2021 the increased nh4 content increased no3 the primary form of crop n absorption but it is easily lost hu et al 2021 through no3 leaching induced by high frequency irrigation and excessive n fertilizer application in the present study adi significantly increased no3 content in the 0 60 cm soil layer root zone and decreased it in the 60 100 cm soil layer possibly due to the combined irrigation fertilization aeration improving soil moisture and pore structure and thus enhancing the soil s capacity to absorb and fix soluble n ions chen et al 2021 reducing n leaching moreover madi n225 had the highest no3 content at 0 100 cm while madi n150 had 14 6 22 2 lower values across the growing season madi n150 decreased nitrate accumulation and reduced n2o emissions compared with mdi n225 reasonable irrigation fertilization aeration management measures could increase n fertilizer residual amounts in the surface layer 0 20 cm reduce n fertilizer loss and inhibit n fertilizer migration to deep soil we suspect that adi inhibits denitrification and enhances no3 retention for example soil no3 of 0 60 cm concentration increased while soil no3 concentration at harvest stage decreased due to crop absorption no3 availability is more conducive to shoot and root development improving crop productivity briones et al 2003 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 reported that adi significantly promoted plant n absorption and migration to fruits and improved n use efficiency increasing plant n supply and enhancing soil n supply capacity no3 concentrations decreased across the growing season possibly because crop n consumption was higher than n inputs changes in n mineralization or nitrification rates could affect inorganic n availability case et al 2015 but there is limited research in this area further studies should focus on the effect of adi on the functional genes related to n cycling and on isotope labeling to investigate issues such as soil n mineralization rates 4 3 soil microbial activity our results found that adi improved smbc more so in tadi n200 than tdi n250 likely due to the increased substrate supply capacity of soil organic carbon under adi and the higher n fertilizer application inhibited smbc generation tedeschi et al 2020 geisseler and scow s 2014 meta analysis of 107 groups of data from 64 studies worldwide revealed that n fertilizer significantly increased smbc by 15 1 attributed to the increased soil organic carbon content gu et al 2019 stated that soil moisture impacted smbc with similar findings for soil microbial activity and moisture content under spring wheat li et al 2004 we also found that smbc decreased with increasing wfps and increased with increasing soil oxygen content figs 9a and 10a possibly due to the improved soil aeration under adi similar results occurred for smbn figs 9b and 10b critical for transforming soil organic n to inorganic n smbn content reflects c and n fixation and release by soil microorganisms increased soil available n can also contribute to smbn production yin et al 2012 thus we expect that the increased no3 and nh4 contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer after aeration improved smbn in the adi treatments soil enzyme activity is critical in the soil biochemical cycle organic matter and mineral transformation araújo et al 2013 lino et al 2016 in this study soil enzyme activities increased and then decreased during the growing season with the higher nutrient demand of crops mid growth stimulating soil enzyme activity water saturation in the root zone under conventional di reduced soil oxygen diffusion ability and inhibited soil enzyme activity freeman et al 2001 our study also found decreased urease and catalase activities with increasing wfps fig 9c d compared with di adi increased soil urease and catalase activities possibly due to the higher oxygen content fig 10c d furthermore n application significantly improved soil urease and catalase activities subsequently increasing the decomposition and conversion of soil n and organic matter enhancing nutrient supply for plant absorption and utilization 4 4 crop yield ysnes and ef to better estimate the combined effects of adi and fertilization on n2o emissions and crop yields we calculated yield scaled n2o emissions ysnes and emission factors ef table 6 to evaluate the balance between soil n2o emissions and crop productivity kim and giltrap 2017 gu et al 2020 our results showed that both fertilization and irrigation significantly influenced crop yield ysnes and ef while adi significantly increased tomato and muskmelon yields by 1 8 15 5 compared with di it produced 1 7 30 6 and 1 4 35 9 higher cumulative n2o emissions and ef respectively than di tadi n150 and tadi n200 produced higher tomato yields than tadi n250 with 14 5 38 9 and 18 3 40 4 lower ynses in both seasons in particular tadi n150 had greater reductions in ysnes and ef than tdi n200 but no significant difference in tomato yield similarly madi n150 decreased cumulative n2o emissions ysnes and ef compared with mdi n225 while also increasing muskmelon yield by 6 9 overall these findings suggest that decreasing the amount of fertilizer n by two fifths to one third combined with adi can reduce soil n2o emissions improve soil n availability and increase yield 5 conclusions aerated drip irrigation adi and n application significantly affect soil moisture soil temperature oxygen content and microbial activity adi significantly increased soil nh4 and no3 contents by 3 7 51 5 in the 0 60 cm soil layer while decreasing n fertilizer migration to deep soil tomato and muskmelon yields increased by 1 8 15 4 under adi compared with di the combination of n reduction and adi mitigated soil n2o fluxes with cumulative n2o emissions decreasing by 14 5 38 9 under adi n150 obtained lower yield scaled n2o emissions ysnes and emission factors ef than n200 n225 and n250 thus adi accompanied by an appropriate n application rate 150 kg ha 1 could improve soil nh4 and no3 availability and productivity reducing soil n2o

8954,in this study changes in the water cycle of watersheds due to climate change were analyzed by evaluating direct runoff based water cycle and the impact of agricultural reservoirs on water cycle improvement was assessed the watershed model hydrological simulation program fortran and the reservoir model module based hydrologic analysis system for agricultural watersheds were linked to analyze the hydrologic components of watersheds including irrigation reservoirs calibration and validation were performed using the measurement data for upstream downstream and reservoir water levels which estimated upstream calibration and validation to be r2 0 96 nse 0 94and r2 0 74 nse 0 74 respectively downstream calibration and validation to be r2 0 72 nse 0 69 and r2 0 78 nse 0 71 respectively and reservoir level to be r2 0 76 water cycle evaluation based on direct runoff was performed using reservoir overflow rice paddy drainage and downstream direct runoff and changes in direct runoff due to the supply of agricultural water through reservoirs were reflected this study found that as climate change intensified the water cycle underwent significant changes including increases in evapotranspiration rainfall and runoff direct runoff although without a large difference in ratio increased in quantity leading to increased variation moreover extreme rainfall events caused a decrease in effective rainfall which could impact agricultural water supply the effect of an agricultural reservoir was analyzed using a scenario without a reservoir agricultural reservoirs reduce runoff and increase evapotranspiration owing to reservoir retention and water supply furthermore as agricultural water supplies increased direct runoff decreased thereby improving the water cycle retention reduced the water cycle variation with the same rainfall contributing to watershed water cycle management and water supply planning overall agricultural reservoirs effectively responded to changes in the watershed water cycle due to climate change keywords agricultural water supply watershed reservoir linkage model direct runoff retention data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the hydrological cycle of earth involves interaction of various components such as precipitation infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration between the atmosphere lithosphere biosphere and anthroposphere in the hydrological cycle water balance refers to the proportion of cyclical components in a watershed water balance can be used to analyze the current conditions and trends of water resources and as an indicator to evaluate water resource availability and sustainability water balance studies enable us to quantify threats to water resources and develop strategies for better utilization and management therefore it is important to accurately predict the components of the water balance and detect changes in it healy et al 2007 rahman thapa et al 2018 2017 climate change is a major factor that affects the hydrological cycle and its components climate change causes an increase in temperature owing to the release of greenhouse gases which induces an increase in evapotranspiration and precipitation rates dagan et al 2019 durack et al 2012 accelerating the water cycle and consequently exacerbating the severity and occurrence of extreme hydrological events kunkel et al 2013 peters lidard et al 2021 from a water budget point of view this causes an increase in direct runoff and evapotranspiration and a decrease in infiltration in agricultural watersheds water security risk increases because of increased direct runoff and crop water requirements increase owing to increased evapotranspiration ding et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to make efforts to maintain the components of the water cycle in response to climate change anthropogenic activities can cause changes in water cycle components farming influences water budgets such as increased evapotranspiration and infiltration ahn et al 2018 compared the irrigation and non irrigation seasons to analyze the hydrological impact of irrigation and found that during the irrigation season evapotranspiration increased by 23 and return flow increased by 1 compared to those in the non irrigation season irrigation also provided an 18 average annual groundwater recharge reservoir construction has an influence on reducing watershed runoff and increasing evaporation li et al 2017 observed flow change in the mekong river basin after dam construction and found that dam construction reduced the streamflow in the wet season and increased it in dry seasons with decreased downstream maximum flow values in korean agricultural reservoirs the rainfall concentrated in july september is stored for use in may of the following year which affects the water budget by converting runoff into reservoir evaporation crop evaporation and infiltration kim et al 2020 appropriate anthropogenic activities are required to respond to the water cycle changes caused by climate change reservoirs are anthropogenic structures that can affect the water cycle and have been studied for their ability to respond to climate change such as flood prevention securing streamflow in the dry season and water supply kim et al 2021 yoo et al 2013 for example jun et al 2020 analyzed the impact of dam heightening on reservoir flood vulnerability changes and found that it increased adaptive capacity which could increase the difference between inflow and outflow thereby reducing vulnerability cui et al 2020 accessed the impact of longyangxia dam construction on the natural flow regime in the upper yellow river basin and found that although climate change increased streamflow in september by 28 and decreased the 1 day annual maximum flow by 43 dam construction offset this by change operating rules however the ability to respond to climate change in terms of the hydrological cycle and water budget was insufficient and quantitative evaluation is required several indicators such as runoff evapotranspiration and infiltration have been used to evaluate the components of the water cycle caused by anthropogenic activities feng et al 2016 jung et al 2013 direct runoff which refers to the amount of rainfall that does not infiltrate the soil and instead flows out of the watershed is particularly important because an increase in direct runoff leads to increased flood risk reduced infiltration and increased nonpoint sources du et al 2015 for this reason direct runoff has been recently used to evaluate the water cycle of a watershed agricultural reservoirs store direct runoff from upstream and use them as agricultural water converting direct runoff into evapotranspiration and infiltration this study aimed to model the conversion of direct runoff into evapotranspiration and infiltration in agricultural reservoirs and evaluate how climate change may affect this process hydrological models are used to estimate climate dependent changes in water budgets and direct runoff martin et al 2016 yilmaz et al 2019 in order to accurately understand the water budget of an agricultural watershed it is necessary to have a precise apprehension of the upstream downstream agricultural water supply and drainage system however simulating agricultural water supply and drainage of irrigation districts only with a watershed model may be challenging therefore recent studies have linked a watershed model with a reservoir model for instance hwang et al 2021 linked soil and water assessment tool environmental fluid dynamics code swat efdc for water quality assessment based on resiliency kim et al 2023 linked hydrological simulation program fortran efdc water quality analysis simulation program hspf efdc wasp to assess the impact of sluice gate operation song et al 2022 linked the tank model and module based hydrologic analysis system for agricultural watershed tank masa to estimate reservoir inflow and outflow from water level observation in this study masa as used by song et al 2022 was used as a reservoir model which is capable of simulating water supply and irrigation districts however hspf a semi distributed model instead of tank was used to enhance the accuracy of the watershed model this study aimed to evaluate changes in the water cycle in agricultural watershed due to climate change using the direct runoff based water cycle evaluation method furthermore the extent to which agricultural water supply and storage effects in the reservoir respond to changes in the water budget caused by climate change was investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area was the jinwi bridge watershed in yongin si and pyeongtaek si korea the jinwi bridge watershed area is 193 05 km2 which is divided by the idong reservoir into 95 53 km2 upstream and 97 52 km2 downstream there are two flow monitoring stations operated by the ministry of environment one located at the watershed exit point called jinwi bridge and the other located upstream of the reservoir called jinwi1 the idong reservoir supplies irrigation water to 10 86 km2 of irrigation district located within the downstream watershed irrigation district is a paddy that maintains its water depth through drainage outlet and is used for cultivating rice using supplied agricultural water and rainfall fig 1 the idong reservoir has an effective storage volume of 17 200 103 m3 and a total storage volume of 20 949 103 m3 the full water level was 45 0 el m and the dead water level was 33 3 el m 2 2 climate data in this study we used past meteorological data rainfall temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine hours from the suwon meteorological observatory provided by the korea meteorological administration for the model calibration and verification then access cm2 a global climate model gcm of cmip6 the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 presented by australia was used to predict future water cycle changes in the watershed the gcm distinguishes five scenarios according to future mitigation and efforts for climate change based on future socio economic changes as well as the baseline radiative forcing strength o neill et al 2014 and four future scenarios ssp 1 2 3 5 were used the bias correction and spatial reduction methods were applied to remove the bias and statistically reduce the predicted meteorological data using the past 1976 2005 climate data of the weather station the model calibration was based on historical meteorological data while simulations from 2022 to 2100 onwards were conducted using climate change data 2 3 watershed reservoir and irrigation district modeling 2 3 1 modeling framework in this study the reservoir and irrigation district simulation modules of masa and the hspf were connected to model agricultural watersheds including agricultural reservoirs the model was built first the watershed upstream of the reservoir was simulated using the hspf the simulated watershed outflow was used as the inflow of the reservoir second the reservoir and irrigation district were simulated using the masa the reservoir water level outflow agricultural water supply and irrigation district drainage were simulated reservoir outflow and irrigation district drainage flow into the reach of the downstream hspf third the infiltration from the irrigation district was configured to flow into the groundwater part downstream this is similar to the method applied by song 2017 for the tank model finally runoff from the downstream was simulated using the hspf fig 2 2 3 2 watershed modeling the hspf is a semi distributed continuous model developed by the u s environmental protection agency the hspf is a conceptual continuous watershed simulation model that simulates the hydrology and quality of a watershed and performs flow paths across the reach the model consists of three modules perlnd implnd and rchres simulating pervious surfaces impervious surfaces and free flow reaches mixed reservoirs respectively duda et al 2012 singh et al 2005 for the watershed runoff simulation the model was divided into two parts upstream and downstream the upstream consisted of 4 sub basins and the downstream of 2 sub basins 2 3 3 reservoir and irrigation district modeling the masa is a simulink based agricultural watershed hydrological analysis program that analyzes irrigated district and reservoir water balances song 2017 the agricultural watershed can be divided into an upstream and a downstream and the operation of the reservoir can be analyzed with a focus in this study reservoir components agricultural water supply and irrigation district drainage were simulated and utilized 2 3 3 1 reservoir water balance changes in reservoir volume were calculated using water budget knowledge based on reservoir inflow and outflow the inflow is surface rainfall and reservoir inflow from the watershed and the outflow is agricultural water supply infiltration surface evaporation and overflow song et al 2016 song et al 2022 vedula and kumar 1996 the formula is the same as that in eq 1 1 ds dt ri r aws e g ro where ri is the reservoir inflow from the watershed m3 s r is the surface rainfall m3 s aws is the agricultural water supply m3 s e is the surface evaporation m3 s g is the reservoir bottom infiltration m3 s and ro is the reservoir overflow from the spillways m3 s 2 3 3 2 agricultural water supply the required amount of agricultural water and drainage to be supplied to the irrigation district was calculated using the water balance equation based on the ponding depth as shown in eq 2 2 pd t pd t 1 rain t ir t pdr t cwr t where pd is the ponding depth mm rain is the effective rainfall mm ir is the irrigation amount mm pdr is the paddy drainage mm cwr is the crop water requirement mm the cwr is the sum of evapotranspiration and infiltration evapotranspiration was calculated using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and the crop factor for each period was applied in table 2 yoo et al 2013 for infiltration a constant value of 4 6 mm day according to previous studies was applied kim et al 2020 song 2017 paddy drainage pdr occurs when the ponding depth is higher than the water outlet height pdmax and does not occur when it is lower than the water outlet height eqs 3 and 4 3 p dr t pd t pd max for pd t pd max 4 pdr t 0 for pd t pd max irrigation ir occurs when the ponding depth is less than the minimum ponding depth pdmin and compensates for the shortfall in the minimum ponding depth eqs 5 and 6 5 ir t pd min pd t for pd t pd min 6 ir t 0 for pd t pd min the pdmax and pdmin values for drainage and irrigation were applied as shown in table 1 using previous studies kim et al 2020 song et al 2019 the amount of agricultural water supply is determined by ir and the corresponding supply efficiency as shown in eq 7 the value of irrigation efficiency varies from year to year depending on the weather topography operation method of the hydraulic facility operator and water management method of farmers therefore in this study the water level of the reservoir was corrected using the annual irrigation efficiency correction song et al 2015 song et al 2016 song et al 2019 7 aws i ir i a r e s 1000 for aws i aws max where aws is the agricultural water supply m3 a r is the irrigated area m2 ir i is the required water amount mm e s is the irrigation efficiency 2 3 4 model calibration the three points were calibrated upstream downstream and in the reservoir for the upstream watershed of the reservoir 7 day interval flow data 2012 2017 from the jinwi1 point of the ministry of environment were used the model calibration period was from 2016 to 2018 and the validation period was from 2012 to 2015 daily flow data 2011 2018 from the jinwi bridge flow observatory of the ministry of environment were used for the downstream watershed of the reservoir the model calibration period was from 2015 to 2018 and the validation period was from 2011 to 2014 for the reservoir water level daily water level data 2002 2018 were used and calibrated using yearly irrigation efficiency song et al 2015 calibration and verification were performed using the trial and error method and the supplemented parameters are shown in table 2 2 4 assessment of water cycle including reservoir 2 4 1 agricultural water cycle rate water cycle evaluation of watersheds is carried out in various ways feng et al 2016 jung et al 2013 in korea the water cycle rate wcr is legally defined this was evaluated as the ratio of the amount of water circulated within the watershed to the amount of precipitation p by excluding the amount that was not circulated within the watershed and flowed out at this time direct runoff dr defined as the amount that could not circulated within the watershed and flowed out eq 8 8 wcr 1 dr p however agricultural watersheds are different from other watersheds because of the retention effect of reservoirs and agricultural water supply therefore it is difficult to evaluate the water cycle simply as a quantity that is not circulated through direct runoff accordingly kim et al 2020 divided agricultural watersheds into upstream watersheds including reservoirs irrigation districts and downstream lateral districts defined noncirculating elements for each and defined the agricultural watershed water cycle rate awcr the amount that is not circulated in the upper watershed including the reservoir is the amount that overflows from the reservoir without being used as agricultural water in the direct runoff from the upper watershed it is defined as the product of the reservoir overflow and the upstream watershed direct runoff rate the amount that could not be circulated in the irrigation district is defined as the amount excluding the effective rainfall during rainfall and the amount drained immediately during rainfall the amount that could not be circulated in the downstream lateral district is defined as the amount that did not infiltrate or evaporate and was defined as direct runoff from the downstream watershed the equation that reflects all these is given by eq 9 9 awcr 1 q o r u d q d p where awcr is the agricultural water cycle rate q o is the reservoir overflow mm r u is the ratio of upstream direct runoff d is the paddy drainage mm q d is the direct runoff of downstream and p is precipitation 2 4 2 separation of direct runoff and base runoff in this study direct runoff and base runoff separations hydrological analysis were performed to evaluated water cycle and water budget to this end the eckhardt filter eckhardt 2005 is used the eckhardt filter has been used by many researchers with good results because it can consider the characteristics of each aquifer through parameters in hydrological analysis bosch et al 2017 lim et al 2010 10 b t 1 bfi max α b t 1 1 α bfi max q t 1 α bfi max where b t is filtered base runoff at time step t bfi max is long run ratio of base runoff to total runoff α is parameter values in the filter and q t is total runoff in time step t in this study a value of 0 8 was applied for bfimax it is known to be suitable for porous aquifers with constant flow and the values applied to the same area in other studies were applied kim et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the performance of the linkage model is shown in table 3 and fig 3 the calibration result for the upstream watershed was r2 0 96 nse 0 94 and the validation result was r2 0 74 nse 0 74 fig 3a the calibration result for the downstream watershed was r2 0 72 nse 0 69 and the validation result was r2 0 78 nse 0 71 fig 3b for the calibration of the reservoir level it was r2 0 76 for the entire period fig 3c according to moriasi et al 2015 if r2 0 6 nse 0 5 and pbias 35 the watershed scale model was evaluated as satisfactory and if r2 0 7 nse 0 7 pbias 15 the watershed scale model was evaluated as good therefore the model in this study also satisfied the satisfactory criteria and for some periods it recorded good or better therefore it can be said that the model performs satisfactorily in simulating the flow of the watershed 3 2 changes in agricultural water supply due to climate change effective rainfall is the amount of rainfall used to increase the water depth of the paddy effectiveness is the ratio of the effective rainfall to the total rainfall during the cropping season increases in effective rainfall reduce drainage and agricultural water requirements the less heavy rainfall and more even rainfall distribution the higher the value lee and huang 2014 the effective rainfall for each scenario is listed in table 4 ssp1 showed the highest effective rainfall of 564 mm 48 3 followed by ssp2 ssp3 and ssp5 effective rainfall appeared to be lower in scenarios with higher carbon emissions and as climate change intensified extreme rainfall appeared higher and more biased rainfall occurred in ssp1 and ssp2 the total rainfall was relatively low but the effective rainfall was high in the ssp5 and ssp3 scenarios the total rainfall was high but the effective rainfall was low as climate change intensifies total rainfall will increase but effective rainfall will decrease this means more water for agriculture and increased vulnerability of water supplies the agricultural water supply for each scenario is listed in table 5 agricultural water supply was the highest in the ssp5 scenario followed by ssp2 ssp1 and ssp3 the deviation was highest in ssp5 followed by ssp1 ssp2 and ssp3 the ssp5 scenario showed a high standard deviation as well as a mean it makes it difficult to predict the demand when establishing supply plans the agricultural water supply is shown in fig 4 showing a continuous increase over time the steepest increasing slope was observed in the ssp5 scenario and the gentlest slope was observed in the ssp1 scenario reaching the dead storage level means that there is no more available water resource and the water supply has been disrupted fig 5 shows the reservoir water level changes as for the days and years of reaching the dead storage level ssp1 had 287 days 11 years ssp2 87 days 6 years ssp3 67 days 3 years and ssp5 337 days 12 years in ssp5 the number of days reaching the dead storage level was the largest and it was found to be vulnerable to securing agricultural water in ssp5 of the 12 years in which the dead water level was reached 8 were in the form of two consecutive years of drought it seems that the ssp5 scenario is highly likely to occur in the form of a continuous drought in the ssp1 scenario the majority of the years when the water level was reached were less than 1000 mm and the rainfall to fill the reservoir appeared after september and recorded the water level during the previous period in the ssp2 and ssp3 scenarios the lowest water level and year of the lowest annual precipitation were reached 3 3 water cycle evaluation in this study the water cycle was evaluated through direct runoff and the differences in reservoir overflow rice paddy drainage and downstream direct runoff were analyzed for each scenario reservoir overflow is simultaneously affected by the annual precipitation and water level of the reservoir in addition if rainfall is low and the water level is not reached it may not occur as shown in fig 6a it rarely occurs when the annual rainfall is less than 1000 mm and it continuously increased above that as shown in fig 6b ssp3 exhibited the highest average value and the rest of the scenarios exhibited similar average values ssp5 showed a low average but a value of 200 mm or more was the same as that of ssp3 paddy drainage increased in proportion to rainfall as shown in fig 7a paddy drainage occurs only during rainfall and all except for the difference between the height of the trough and the current ponding level are drained therefore it was found to be proportional to the amount of rainfall as with reservoir overflow the highest and lowest values were found in ssp5 fig 7b direct runoff from downstream non irrigation area showed an increase in runoff as rainfall increased as shown in fig 8a and was shown in the shape of a quadratic function in ssp5 the highest lowest and average values appeared fig 8b table 6 presents the results of direct runoff and water cycle for each scenario the direct runoff and water cycle rate recorded the highest average in the ssp3 scenario but ssp5 showed high standard deviation maximum and minimum this suggests that although total rainfall increased in both ssp3 and ssp5 due to climate change more extreme rainfall events occurred in ssp5 the low rainfall generated in ssp5 reduced the amount of storage in the reservoir and maximized runoff storage and water utilization when heavy rainfall occurred later for this reason it seems that the evaluation result was better than that of ssp3 the results of calculating the amount and rate of evapotranspiration base runoff and direct runoff for each scenario are shown in fig 9 ssp5 scenario had the largest annual rainfall but the ratio of direct runoff and base runoff was similar to that of ssp1 because evapotranspiration increased due to high temperature in the ssp3 scenario the amount of rainfall was similar to that of ssp5 but the temperature rise was less than that of ssp5 and evapotranspiration was 54 6 the lowest among all scenarios in addition because of this the amount of outflow was large so the direct runoff and base runoff were large 3 4 reservoir impact agricultural reservoirs in korea store water during the flood season and use it during the dry season because of the influence of the monsoon climate this improves the water cycle in the watershed by storing direct runoff as climate change progresses extreme rainfall and annual rainfall variations increase increasing the importance of reservoirs therefore in this study we attempted to quantify the reservoir and agricultural water supply through the assumption of a scenario in which there is no agricultural reservoir in this scenario as shown in fig 10 except for the reservoir module it was modeled such that the outflow from the upstream watershed of the reservoir flowed to the end of the watershed as it was downstream in addition the existing irrigation district did not supply agricultural water assuming that paddy fields were cultivated only by rainfall but only simulated drainage and infiltration according to the height of the outlet fig 11 shows the changes in runoff and evapotranspiration rates for each scenario in all scenarios runoff decreased and evapotranspiration increased this is due to the increase in reservoir evaporation due to runoff retention and evapotranspiration from the water supply the amount of conversion was similar at about 140 mm in all scenarios but it was relatively low in ssp3 and ssp5 due to the difference in total rainfall direct runoff and water cycle rates were evaluated according to the scenario and the average maximum and minimum values decreased as shown in table 7 in all scenarios except ssp3 the water cycle deteriorated when there was no reservoir the maximum value worsened and the minimum value worsened except for ssp1 fig 12 shows the water cycle rate and direct runoff with respect to all rainfall with and without reservoirs when there is a reservoir the rainfall and water cycle rates are in a stable inverse proportion whereas in the case of no reservoir there are many years in which the water cycle rate rapidly decreases even with similar annual rainfall it seems that the water cycle is stably changed by storing it in a reservoir and using agricultural water the improvement in the water cycle rate through the reservoir was evident in rainfall of 1500 mm or less which may be because most of the direct runoff from the reservoir was used as agricultural water in the case of the year with an annual rainfall of 1500 mm or less in the case of a rainfall of 1500 mm or more the water cycle rate tends to be high when there is no reservoir or agricultural water supply by scenario the water cycle rate of 61 years the largest year in ssp5 improved during the analyzed period of 81 years from 2020 to 2100 59 years in ssp1 and ssp2 and 55 years in ssp3 ssp1 and ssp2 showed a stronger improvement in the water cycle rate over time but ssp3 and ssp5 showed almost the same level of improvement fig 13 the water cycle rate has decreased in some years which can be attributed to several reasons firstly most of the rainfall overflowed due to the constant full capacity level in the years when the difference in water cycle rate recorded a negative value as shown in fig 14 the water level of the reservoir during the irrigation season which starts in april and ends in september was recorded as 45 which is the full capacity level despite the supply of agricultural water the water level of the reservoir did not decrease and most of the inflow was directly discharged as overflow second a certain amount of rainfall needed to be secured in cases of low rainfall most of the inflow was converted to agricultural water use and there was no overflow in cases of high rainfall there is a risk of decreased water cycle due to the occurrence of overflow which was found to be 1150 mm in this study fig 15a third the number of rains was greater than a certain amount and rainfall occurred steadily resulting in a low supply of agricultural water when the supply of agricultural water is low most of the reservoir water is converted to overflow which appears to have a negative influence on the water cycle fig 15b it was thought that active agricultural water utilization can contribute to improving the water cycle 4 conclusions in this study watershed water cycle changes due to climate change were analyzed through a water cycle evaluation based on direct runoff and the impact of agricultural reservoirs on water cycle improvement was evaluated for the climate change scenario analysis a watershed model hspf and an agricultural water supply model masa were linked and simulated for the direct runoff based evaluation direct runoff from the watershed including the agricultural reservoir was evaluated as the reservoir overflow upstream direct runoff rate paddy drainage and downstream lateral direct runoff changes in the water budget according to climate change scenarios showed that evapotranspiration increased as carbon emissions increased however the ratios were similar because rainfall also increased the agricultural water supply has been observed to increase this was found to be due to the increase in evapotranspiration caused by the increase in temperature and the decrease in effective rainfall caused by extreme rainfall although the amount of rainfall increased from the point of view of direct runoff reservoir overflow was highest in the ssp3 scenario and paddy drainage and downstream direct runoff were highest in the ssp5 scenario as a result of the final water cycle rate evaluation ssp3 showed the lowest average value but ssp5 showed high maximum minimum and standard deviations and the average was similar to that of ssp3 this is because more extreme events such as droughts and floods occurred in ssp5 this implies that water resource management is more difficult reservoirs have been shown to improve the water cycle in watersheds through direct runoff in most years the water cycle was found to improve with reservoirs rather than without them when rainfall in the watershed is low the efficiency of water resource use is increased by converting the direct runoff from the watershed into agricultural water for this reason it has been shown that the degree of improvement in the water cycle increases when the amount of water converted to agricultural water is large in the case of a year in which some water cycles fell it seems that the previous year s rainfall was high so the reservoir started at full water level and there was a lot of reservoir overflow the use of reservoirs to supply agricultural water has been demonstrated as an effective method for mitigating direct runoff from watersheds caused by climate change this approach also simplifies the prediction of direct runoff quantities the results of this study suggested the need to consider agricultural reservoirs in watershed unit water cycle policies in korea and showed evaluation methods and expected effects agricultural reservoirs can be an effective infrastructure in the current korean water cycle policy to reduce direct runoff and respond to climate change as an additional study it will be possible to derive the optimal operation technique of an agricultural reservoir for the purpose of improving water cycle and it will be applicable to the reservoir operation technique in the field a limitation of this study is that only a single gcm and study site was used therefore future studies should consider versatility and uncertainty through

8954,in this study changes in the water cycle of watersheds due to climate change were analyzed by evaluating direct runoff based water cycle and the impact of agricultural reservoirs on water cycle improvement was assessed the watershed model hydrological simulation program fortran and the reservoir model module based hydrologic analysis system for agricultural watersheds were linked to analyze the hydrologic components of watersheds including irrigation reservoirs calibration and validation were performed using the measurement data for upstream downstream and reservoir water levels which estimated upstream calibration and validation to be r2 0 96 nse 0 94and r2 0 74 nse 0 74 respectively downstream calibration and validation to be r2 0 72 nse 0 69 and r2 0 78 nse 0 71 respectively and reservoir level to be r2 0 76 water cycle evaluation based on direct runoff was performed using reservoir overflow rice paddy drainage and downstream direct runoff and changes in direct runoff due to the supply of agricultural water through reservoirs were reflected this study found that as climate change intensified the water cycle underwent significant changes including increases in evapotranspiration rainfall and runoff direct runoff although without a large difference in ratio increased in quantity leading to increased variation moreover extreme rainfall events caused a decrease in effective rainfall which could impact agricultural water supply the effect of an agricultural reservoir was analyzed using a scenario without a reservoir agricultural reservoirs reduce runoff and increase evapotranspiration owing to reservoir retention and water supply furthermore as agricultural water supplies increased direct runoff decreased thereby improving the water cycle retention reduced the water cycle variation with the same rainfall contributing to watershed water cycle management and water supply planning overall agricultural reservoirs effectively responded to changes in the watershed water cycle due to climate change keywords agricultural water supply watershed reservoir linkage model direct runoff retention data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the hydrological cycle of earth involves interaction of various components such as precipitation infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration between the atmosphere lithosphere biosphere and anthroposphere in the hydrological cycle water balance refers to the proportion of cyclical components in a watershed water balance can be used to analyze the current conditions and trends of water resources and as an indicator to evaluate water resource availability and sustainability water balance studies enable us to quantify threats to water resources and develop strategies for better utilization and management therefore it is important to accurately predict the components of the water balance and detect changes in it healy et al 2007 rahman thapa et al 2018 2017 climate change is a major factor that affects the hydrological cycle and its components climate change causes an increase in temperature owing to the release of greenhouse gases which induces an increase in evapotranspiration and precipitation rates dagan et al 2019 durack et al 2012 accelerating the water cycle and consequently exacerbating the severity and occurrence of extreme hydrological events kunkel et al 2013 peters lidard et al 2021 from a water budget point of view this causes an increase in direct runoff and evapotranspiration and a decrease in infiltration in agricultural watersheds water security risk increases because of increased direct runoff and crop water requirements increase owing to increased evapotranspiration ding et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to make efforts to maintain the components of the water cycle in response to climate change anthropogenic activities can cause changes in water cycle components farming influences water budgets such as increased evapotranspiration and infiltration ahn et al 2018 compared the irrigation and non irrigation seasons to analyze the hydrological impact of irrigation and found that during the irrigation season evapotranspiration increased by 23 and return flow increased by 1 compared to those in the non irrigation season irrigation also provided an 18 average annual groundwater recharge reservoir construction has an influence on reducing watershed runoff and increasing evaporation li et al 2017 observed flow change in the mekong river basin after dam construction and found that dam construction reduced the streamflow in the wet season and increased it in dry seasons with decreased downstream maximum flow values in korean agricultural reservoirs the rainfall concentrated in july september is stored for use in may of the following year which affects the water budget by converting runoff into reservoir evaporation crop evaporation and infiltration kim et al 2020 appropriate anthropogenic activities are required to respond to the water cycle changes caused by climate change reservoirs are anthropogenic structures that can affect the water cycle and have been studied for their ability to respond to climate change such as flood prevention securing streamflow in the dry season and water supply kim et al 2021 yoo et al 2013 for example jun et al 2020 analyzed the impact of dam heightening on reservoir flood vulnerability changes and found that it increased adaptive capacity which could increase the difference between inflow and outflow thereby reducing vulnerability cui et al 2020 accessed the impact of longyangxia dam construction on the natural flow regime in the upper yellow river basin and found that although climate change increased streamflow in september by 28 and decreased the 1 day annual maximum flow by 43 dam construction offset this by change operating rules however the ability to respond to climate change in terms of the hydrological cycle and water budget was insufficient and quantitative evaluation is required several indicators such as runoff evapotranspiration and infiltration have been used to evaluate the components of the water cycle caused by anthropogenic activities feng et al 2016 jung et al 2013 direct runoff which refers to the amount of rainfall that does not infiltrate the soil and instead flows out of the watershed is particularly important because an increase in direct runoff leads to increased flood risk reduced infiltration and increased nonpoint sources du et al 2015 for this reason direct runoff has been recently used to evaluate the water cycle of a watershed agricultural reservoirs store direct runoff from upstream and use them as agricultural water converting direct runoff into evapotranspiration and infiltration this study aimed to model the conversion of direct runoff into evapotranspiration and infiltration in agricultural reservoirs and evaluate how climate change may affect this process hydrological models are used to estimate climate dependent changes in water budgets and direct runoff martin et al 2016 yilmaz et al 2019 in order to accurately understand the water budget of an agricultural watershed it is necessary to have a precise apprehension of the upstream downstream agricultural water supply and drainage system however simulating agricultural water supply and drainage of irrigation districts only with a watershed model may be challenging therefore recent studies have linked a watershed model with a reservoir model for instance hwang et al 2021 linked soil and water assessment tool environmental fluid dynamics code swat efdc for water quality assessment based on resiliency kim et al 2023 linked hydrological simulation program fortran efdc water quality analysis simulation program hspf efdc wasp to assess the impact of sluice gate operation song et al 2022 linked the tank model and module based hydrologic analysis system for agricultural watershed tank masa to estimate reservoir inflow and outflow from water level observation in this study masa as used by song et al 2022 was used as a reservoir model which is capable of simulating water supply and irrigation districts however hspf a semi distributed model instead of tank was used to enhance the accuracy of the watershed model this study aimed to evaluate changes in the water cycle in agricultural watershed due to climate change using the direct runoff based water cycle evaluation method furthermore the extent to which agricultural water supply and storage effects in the reservoir respond to changes in the water budget caused by climate change was investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area was the jinwi bridge watershed in yongin si and pyeongtaek si korea the jinwi bridge watershed area is 193 05 km2 which is divided by the idong reservoir into 95 53 km2 upstream and 97 52 km2 downstream there are two flow monitoring stations operated by the ministry of environment one located at the watershed exit point called jinwi bridge and the other located upstream of the reservoir called jinwi1 the idong reservoir supplies irrigation water to 10 86 km2 of irrigation district located within the downstream watershed irrigation district is a paddy that maintains its water depth through drainage outlet and is used for cultivating rice using supplied agricultural water and rainfall fig 1 the idong reservoir has an effective storage volume of 17 200 103 m3 and a total storage volume of 20 949 103 m3 the full water level was 45 0 el m and the dead water level was 33 3 el m 2 2 climate data in this study we used past meteorological data rainfall temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine hours from the suwon meteorological observatory provided by the korea meteorological administration for the model calibration and verification then access cm2 a global climate model gcm of cmip6 the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 presented by australia was used to predict future water cycle changes in the watershed the gcm distinguishes five scenarios according to future mitigation and efforts for climate change based on future socio economic changes as well as the baseline radiative forcing strength o neill et al 2014 and four future scenarios ssp 1 2 3 5 were used the bias correction and spatial reduction methods were applied to remove the bias and statistically reduce the predicted meteorological data using the past 1976 2005 climate data of the weather station the model calibration was based on historical meteorological data while simulations from 2022 to 2100 onwards were conducted using climate change data 2 3 watershed reservoir and irrigation district modeling 2 3 1 modeling framework in this study the reservoir and irrigation district simulation modules of masa and the hspf were connected to model agricultural watersheds including agricultural reservoirs the model was built first the watershed upstream of the reservoir was simulated using the hspf the simulated watershed outflow was used as the inflow of the reservoir second the reservoir and irrigation district were simulated using the masa the reservoir water level outflow agricultural water supply and irrigation district drainage were simulated reservoir outflow and irrigation district drainage flow into the reach of the downstream hspf third the infiltration from the irrigation district was configured to flow into the groundwater part downstream this is similar to the method applied by song 2017 for the tank model finally runoff from the downstream was simulated using the hspf fig 2 2 3 2 watershed modeling the hspf is a semi distributed continuous model developed by the u s environmental protection agency the hspf is a conceptual continuous watershed simulation model that simulates the hydrology and quality of a watershed and performs flow paths across the reach the model consists of three modules perlnd implnd and rchres simulating pervious surfaces impervious surfaces and free flow reaches mixed reservoirs respectively duda et al 2012 singh et al 2005 for the watershed runoff simulation the model was divided into two parts upstream and downstream the upstream consisted of 4 sub basins and the downstream of 2 sub basins 2 3 3 reservoir and irrigation district modeling the masa is a simulink based agricultural watershed hydrological analysis program that analyzes irrigated district and reservoir water balances song 2017 the agricultural watershed can be divided into an upstream and a downstream and the operation of the reservoir can be analyzed with a focus in this study reservoir components agricultural water supply and irrigation district drainage were simulated and utilized 2 3 3 1 reservoir water balance changes in reservoir volume were calculated using water budget knowledge based on reservoir inflow and outflow the inflow is surface rainfall and reservoir inflow from the watershed and the outflow is agricultural water supply infiltration surface evaporation and overflow song et al 2016 song et al 2022 vedula and kumar 1996 the formula is the same as that in eq 1 1 ds dt ri r aws e g ro where ri is the reservoir inflow from the watershed m3 s r is the surface rainfall m3 s aws is the agricultural water supply m3 s e is the surface evaporation m3 s g is the reservoir bottom infiltration m3 s and ro is the reservoir overflow from the spillways m3 s 2 3 3 2 agricultural water supply the required amount of agricultural water and drainage to be supplied to the irrigation district was calculated using the water balance equation based on the ponding depth as shown in eq 2 2 pd t pd t 1 rain t ir t pdr t cwr t where pd is the ponding depth mm rain is the effective rainfall mm ir is the irrigation amount mm pdr is the paddy drainage mm cwr is the crop water requirement mm the cwr is the sum of evapotranspiration and infiltration evapotranspiration was calculated using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and the crop factor for each period was applied in table 2 yoo et al 2013 for infiltration a constant value of 4 6 mm day according to previous studies was applied kim et al 2020 song 2017 paddy drainage pdr occurs when the ponding depth is higher than the water outlet height pdmax and does not occur when it is lower than the water outlet height eqs 3 and 4 3 p dr t pd t pd max for pd t pd max 4 pdr t 0 for pd t pd max irrigation ir occurs when the ponding depth is less than the minimum ponding depth pdmin and compensates for the shortfall in the minimum ponding depth eqs 5 and 6 5 ir t pd min pd t for pd t pd min 6 ir t 0 for pd t pd min the pdmax and pdmin values for drainage and irrigation were applied as shown in table 1 using previous studies kim et al 2020 song et al 2019 the amount of agricultural water supply is determined by ir and the corresponding supply efficiency as shown in eq 7 the value of irrigation efficiency varies from year to year depending on the weather topography operation method of the hydraulic facility operator and water management method of farmers therefore in this study the water level of the reservoir was corrected using the annual irrigation efficiency correction song et al 2015 song et al 2016 song et al 2019 7 aws i ir i a r e s 1000 for aws i aws max where aws is the agricultural water supply m3 a r is the irrigated area m2 ir i is the required water amount mm e s is the irrigation efficiency 2 3 4 model calibration the three points were calibrated upstream downstream and in the reservoir for the upstream watershed of the reservoir 7 day interval flow data 2012 2017 from the jinwi1 point of the ministry of environment were used the model calibration period was from 2016 to 2018 and the validation period was from 2012 to 2015 daily flow data 2011 2018 from the jinwi bridge flow observatory of the ministry of environment were used for the downstream watershed of the reservoir the model calibration period was from 2015 to 2018 and the validation period was from 2011 to 2014 for the reservoir water level daily water level data 2002 2018 were used and calibrated using yearly irrigation efficiency song et al 2015 calibration and verification were performed using the trial and error method and the supplemented parameters are shown in table 2 2 4 assessment of water cycle including reservoir 2 4 1 agricultural water cycle rate water cycle evaluation of watersheds is carried out in various ways feng et al 2016 jung et al 2013 in korea the water cycle rate wcr is legally defined this was evaluated as the ratio of the amount of water circulated within the watershed to the amount of precipitation p by excluding the amount that was not circulated within the watershed and flowed out at this time direct runoff dr defined as the amount that could not circulated within the watershed and flowed out eq 8 8 wcr 1 dr p however agricultural watersheds are different from other watersheds because of the retention effect of reservoirs and agricultural water supply therefore it is difficult to evaluate the water cycle simply as a quantity that is not circulated through direct runoff accordingly kim et al 2020 divided agricultural watersheds into upstream watersheds including reservoirs irrigation districts and downstream lateral districts defined noncirculating elements for each and defined the agricultural watershed water cycle rate awcr the amount that is not circulated in the upper watershed including the reservoir is the amount that overflows from the reservoir without being used as agricultural water in the direct runoff from the upper watershed it is defined as the product of the reservoir overflow and the upstream watershed direct runoff rate the amount that could not be circulated in the irrigation district is defined as the amount excluding the effective rainfall during rainfall and the amount drained immediately during rainfall the amount that could not be circulated in the downstream lateral district is defined as the amount that did not infiltrate or evaporate and was defined as direct runoff from the downstream watershed the equation that reflects all these is given by eq 9 9 awcr 1 q o r u d q d p where awcr is the agricultural water cycle rate q o is the reservoir overflow mm r u is the ratio of upstream direct runoff d is the paddy drainage mm q d is the direct runoff of downstream and p is precipitation 2 4 2 separation of direct runoff and base runoff in this study direct runoff and base runoff separations hydrological analysis were performed to evaluated water cycle and water budget to this end the eckhardt filter eckhardt 2005 is used the eckhardt filter has been used by many researchers with good results because it can consider the characteristics of each aquifer through parameters in hydrological analysis bosch et al 2017 lim et al 2010 10 b t 1 bfi max α b t 1 1 α bfi max q t 1 α bfi max where b t is filtered base runoff at time step t bfi max is long run ratio of base runoff to total runoff α is parameter values in the filter and q t is total runoff in time step t in this study a value of 0 8 was applied for bfimax it is known to be suitable for porous aquifers with constant flow and the values applied to the same area in other studies were applied kim et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the performance of the linkage model is shown in table 3 and fig 3 the calibration result for the upstream watershed was r2 0 96 nse 0 94 and the validation result was r2 0 74 nse 0 74 fig 3a the calibration result for the downstream watershed was r2 0 72 nse 0 69 and the validation result was r2 0 78 nse 0 71 fig 3b for the calibration of the reservoir level it was r2 0 76 for the entire period fig 3c according to moriasi et al 2015 if r2 0 6 nse 0 5 and pbias 35 the watershed scale model was evaluated as satisfactory and if r2 0 7 nse 0 7 pbias 15 the watershed scale model was evaluated as good therefore the model in this study also satisfied the satisfactory criteria and for some periods it recorded good or better therefore it can be said that the model performs satisfactorily in simulating the flow of the watershed 3 2 changes in agricultural water supply due to climate change effective rainfall is the amount of rainfall used to increase the water depth of the paddy effectiveness is the ratio of the effective rainfall to the total rainfall during the cropping season increases in effective rainfall reduce drainage and agricultural water requirements the less heavy rainfall and more even rainfall distribution the higher the value lee and huang 2014 the effective rainfall for each scenario is listed in table 4 ssp1 showed the highest effective rainfall of 564 mm 48 3 followed by ssp2 ssp3 and ssp5 effective rainfall appeared to be lower in scenarios with higher carbon emissions and as climate change intensified extreme rainfall appeared higher and more biased rainfall occurred in ssp1 and ssp2 the total rainfall was relatively low but the effective rainfall was high in the ssp5 and ssp3 scenarios the total rainfall was high but the effective rainfall was low as climate change intensifies total rainfall will increase but effective rainfall will decrease this means more water for agriculture and increased vulnerability of water supplies the agricultural water supply for each scenario is listed in table 5 agricultural water supply was the highest in the ssp5 scenario followed by ssp2 ssp1 and ssp3 the deviation was highest in ssp5 followed by ssp1 ssp2 and ssp3 the ssp5 scenario showed a high standard deviation as well as a mean it makes it difficult to predict the demand when establishing supply plans the agricultural water supply is shown in fig 4 showing a continuous increase over time the steepest increasing slope was observed in the ssp5 scenario and the gentlest slope was observed in the ssp1 scenario reaching the dead storage level means that there is no more available water resource and the water supply has been disrupted fig 5 shows the reservoir water level changes as for the days and years of reaching the dead storage level ssp1 had 287 days 11 years ssp2 87 days 6 years ssp3 67 days 3 years and ssp5 337 days 12 years in ssp5 the number of days reaching the dead storage level was the largest and it was found to be vulnerable to securing agricultural water in ssp5 of the 12 years in which the dead water level was reached 8 were in the form of two consecutive years of drought it seems that the ssp5 scenario is highly likely to occur in the form of a continuous drought in the ssp1 scenario the majority of the years when the water level was reached were less than 1000 mm and the rainfall to fill the reservoir appeared after september and recorded the water level during the previous period in the ssp2 and ssp3 scenarios the lowest water level and year of the lowest annual precipitation were reached 3 3 water cycle evaluation in this study the water cycle was evaluated through direct runoff and the differences in reservoir overflow rice paddy drainage and downstream direct runoff were analyzed for each scenario reservoir overflow is simultaneously affected by the annual precipitation and water level of the reservoir in addition if rainfall is low and the water level is not reached it may not occur as shown in fig 6a it rarely occurs when the annual rainfall is less than 1000 mm and it continuously increased above that as shown in fig 6b ssp3 exhibited the highest average value and the rest of the scenarios exhibited similar average values ssp5 showed a low average but a value of 200 mm or more was the same as that of ssp3 paddy drainage increased in proportion to rainfall as shown in fig 7a paddy drainage occurs only during rainfall and all except for the difference between the height of the trough and the current ponding level are drained therefore it was found to be proportional to the amount of rainfall as with reservoir overflow the highest and lowest values were found in ssp5 fig 7b direct runoff from downstream non irrigation area showed an increase in runoff as rainfall increased as shown in fig 8a and was shown in the shape of a quadratic function in ssp5 the highest lowest and average values appeared fig 8b table 6 presents the results of direct runoff and water cycle for each scenario the direct runoff and water cycle rate recorded the highest average in the ssp3 scenario but ssp5 showed high standard deviation maximum and minimum this suggests that although total rainfall increased in both ssp3 and ssp5 due to climate change more extreme rainfall events occurred in ssp5 the low rainfall generated in ssp5 reduced the amount of storage in the reservoir and maximized runoff storage and water utilization when heavy rainfall occurred later for this reason it seems that the evaluation result was better than that of ssp3 the results of calculating the amount and rate of evapotranspiration base runoff and direct runoff for each scenario are shown in fig 9 ssp5 scenario had the largest annual rainfall but the ratio of direct runoff and base runoff was similar to that of ssp1 because evapotranspiration increased due to high temperature in the ssp3 scenario the amount of rainfall was similar to that of ssp5 but the temperature rise was less than that of ssp5 and evapotranspiration was 54 6 the lowest among all scenarios in addition because of this the amount of outflow was large so the direct runoff and base runoff were large 3 4 reservoir impact agricultural reservoirs in korea store water during the flood season and use it during the dry season because of the influence of the monsoon climate this improves the water cycle in the watershed by storing direct runoff as climate change progresses extreme rainfall and annual rainfall variations increase increasing the importance of reservoirs therefore in this study we attempted to quantify the reservoir and agricultural water supply through the assumption of a scenario in which there is no agricultural reservoir in this scenario as shown in fig 10 except for the reservoir module it was modeled such that the outflow from the upstream watershed of the reservoir flowed to the end of the watershed as it was downstream in addition the existing irrigation district did not supply agricultural water assuming that paddy fields were cultivated only by rainfall but only simulated drainage and infiltration according to the height of the outlet fig 11 shows the changes in runoff and evapotranspiration rates for each scenario in all scenarios runoff decreased and evapotranspiration increased this is due to the increase in reservoir evaporation due to runoff retention and evapotranspiration from the water supply the amount of conversion was similar at about 140 mm in all scenarios but it was relatively low in ssp3 and ssp5 due to the difference in total rainfall direct runoff and water cycle rates were evaluated according to the scenario and the average maximum and minimum values decreased as shown in table 7 in all scenarios except ssp3 the water cycle deteriorated when there was no reservoir the maximum value worsened and the minimum value worsened except for ssp1 fig 12 shows the water cycle rate and direct runoff with respect to all rainfall with and without reservoirs when there is a reservoir the rainfall and water cycle rates are in a stable inverse proportion whereas in the case of no reservoir there are many years in which the water cycle rate rapidly decreases even with similar annual rainfall it seems that the water cycle is stably changed by storing it in a reservoir and using agricultural water the improvement in the water cycle rate through the reservoir was evident in rainfall of 1500 mm or less which may be because most of the direct runoff from the reservoir was used as agricultural water in the case of the year with an annual rainfall of 1500 mm or less in the case of a rainfall of 1500 mm or more the water cycle rate tends to be high when there is no reservoir or agricultural water supply by scenario the water cycle rate of 61 years the largest year in ssp5 improved during the analyzed period of 81 years from 2020 to 2100 59 years in ssp1 and ssp2 and 55 years in ssp3 ssp1 and ssp2 showed a stronger improvement in the water cycle rate over time but ssp3 and ssp5 showed almost the same level of improvement fig 13 the water cycle rate has decreased in some years which can be attributed to several reasons firstly most of the rainfall overflowed due to the constant full capacity level in the years when the difference in water cycle rate recorded a negative value as shown in fig 14 the water level of the reservoir during the irrigation season which starts in april and ends in september was recorded as 45 which is the full capacity level despite the supply of agricultural water the water level of the reservoir did not decrease and most of the inflow was directly discharged as overflow second a certain amount of rainfall needed to be secured in cases of low rainfall most of the inflow was converted to agricultural water use and there was no overflow in cases of high rainfall there is a risk of decreased water cycle due to the occurrence of overflow which was found to be 1150 mm in this study fig 15a third the number of rains was greater than a certain amount and rainfall occurred steadily resulting in a low supply of agricultural water when the supply of agricultural water is low most of the reservoir water is converted to overflow which appears to have a negative influence on the water cycle fig 15b it was thought that active agricultural water utilization can contribute to improving the water cycle 4 conclusions in this study watershed water cycle changes due to climate change were analyzed through a water cycle evaluation based on direct runoff and the impact of agricultural reservoirs on water cycle improvement was evaluated for the climate change scenario analysis a watershed model hspf and an agricultural water supply model masa were linked and simulated for the direct runoff based evaluation direct runoff from the watershed including the agricultural reservoir was evaluated as the reservoir overflow upstream direct runoff rate paddy drainage and downstream lateral direct runoff changes in the water budget according to climate change scenarios showed that evapotranspiration increased as carbon emissions increased however the ratios were similar because rainfall also increased the agricultural water supply has been observed to increase this was found to be due to the increase in evapotranspiration caused by the increase in temperature and the decrease in effective rainfall caused by extreme rainfall although the amount of rainfall increased from the point of view of direct runoff reservoir overflow was highest in the ssp3 scenario and paddy drainage and downstream direct runoff were highest in the ssp5 scenario as a result of the final water cycle rate evaluation ssp3 showed the lowest average value but ssp5 showed high maximum minimum and standard deviations and the average was similar to that of ssp3 this is because more extreme events such as droughts and floods occurred in ssp5 this implies that water resource management is more difficult reservoirs have been shown to improve the water cycle in watersheds through direct runoff in most years the water cycle was found to improve with reservoirs rather than without them when rainfall in the watershed is low the efficiency of water resource use is increased by converting the direct runoff from the watershed into agricultural water for this reason it has been shown that the degree of improvement in the water cycle increases when the amount of water converted to agricultural water is large in the case of a year in which some water cycles fell it seems that the previous year s rainfall was high so the reservoir started at full water level and there was a lot of reservoir overflow the use of reservoirs to supply agricultural water has been demonstrated as an effective method for mitigating direct runoff from watersheds caused by climate change this approach also simplifies the prediction of direct runoff quantities the results of this study suggested the need to consider agricultural reservoirs in watershed unit water cycle policies in korea and showed evaluation methods and expected effects agricultural reservoirs can be an effective infrastructure in the current korean water cycle policy to reduce direct runoff and respond to climate change as an additional study it will be possible to derive the optimal operation technique of an agricultural reservoir for the purpose of improving water cycle and it will be applicable to the reservoir operation technique in the field a limitation of this study is that only a single gcm and study site was used therefore future studies should consider versatility and uncertainty through
