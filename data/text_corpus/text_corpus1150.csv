5750,as the third pole of the earth qinghai tibet plateau qtp has been significantly affected by climate change which makes it an ideal and unique site for critical zone cz research however we have limited knowledge of the subsurface cz structure hydrologic processes and their interplays due to extremely scarce observations in such a harsh environment in this study we performed a suite of hillslope scale experiments that integrated geophysical hydrological pedological and hydrometric observations to investigate the characteristics of the subsurface cz structure hydrologic processes pedological attributes and their interplays influenced by micro topography the results reveal that the subsurface cz structure and pedological attributes exhibit systematic differences in the aspect gradient north facing and south facing slope the thickness of the soil saprolite weathered layer on the north facing slope is 0 3 m 0 2 m 0 6 m thicker than that of the south facing slope the soil porosity saturated water content capillary water content field capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity of the shallow soil layer 0 10 cm in the north facing slope is 77 2 140 1 128 2 125 8 0 67 mm min 1 which is 8 7 26 3 24 0 22 6 0 52 mm min 1 larger than those of the south facing slope in contrast those properties of the deep soil layer 80 90 cm in the north facing slope is 44 3 34 3 32 0 29 8 0 06 mm min 1 which is 11 5 19 8 21 0 18 7 0 28 mm min 1 smaller than those of the south facing slope the bulk density of the shallow soil layer in the north facing slope is 0 54 g cm 3 which is 0 06 g cm 3 smaller than that of the south facing slope in contrast the bulk density of the deep soil layer is 1 30 g cm 3 which is 0 26 g cm 3 larger than that of the south facing slope the subsurface cz structure and micro topography cause the hydrological processes on the south facing slope is dominated by surface flow while those on the north facing slope is dominated by subsurface flow the subsurface flow on the north facing slope accounts for 94 5 of the total runoff while the surface flow on the south facing slope accounts for 97 9 of the total runoff in turn the dominant runoff regime leads to a decrease of thickness of the soil layer from the top to the bottom of the south facing slope with severe slope creep and landslides on the north facing slope our results suggest that the subsurface cz structure and dominating runoff regime are significantly affected by the micro topography gradient which should be parameterized for large scale research keywords earth critical zone soil structure hydrological processes micro topography geophysics qinghai tibet plateau 1 introduction cold regions such as polar sub polar regions high latitudes and the third pole regions high altitudes play a crucial role in human earth systems and its sustainable development bibi et al 2018 bring et al 2016 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 yao et al 2019 cold regions have gained increasing attention in the past few decades due to its important ecological functions and remarkable changes impacted by climate change biskaborn et al 2019 gao et al 2019 hinzman et al 2013 immerzeel et al 2010 yang et al 2019 understanding subsurface critical zone cz extends from the top of the vegetative canopy through the soil and down to the bedrock till the bottom of the groundwater structure hydrological processes and their interplays are seen as critical elements under climate change which however is poorly understand in cold regions angermann et al 2017 brooks et al 2015 guo and lin 2016 jackisch et al 2017 white et al 2015 yang et al 2019 due to the difficulties in direct observations and the harsh environment the lack of integrated observational studies and data of subsurface cz structures and hydrological processes is the main challenge in cold region research li et al 2018 yang et al 2019 yao et al 2019 the hydrogeologic processes in cold regions are complicated due to coupled hydro thermal mechanical chemical and freeze thaw ft processes within the wide spread frozen ground cheng and jin 2012 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 yang et al 2010 for example frozen ground is often considered as a relatively impermeable layer which inhibits infiltration and promotes surface and subsurface flow generation carey and woo 2005 koch et al 2014 yamazaki et al 2006 the thawing front in the active layer moves progressively due to seasonally dynamic thermal condition frozen ground or permafrost can inhibit the exchange of surface water walvoord and kurylyk 2016 wright 2008 zhao et al 2000 in the past few decades hydrological process and hydrogeologic properties in cold regions have been greatly altered by climate change such as glacier retreat gao et al 2019 wang et al 2015 yao et al 2007 snow melt dai et al 2017 and permafrost degradation frampton et al 2012 ishikawa et al 2018 ran et al 2018 yang et al 2010 which will future impact regional runoff streamflow magnitude and seasonality water storage capacity and service of the cz frampton et al 2012 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 yang et al 2010 therefore understanding the dynamic changes of the water resources and ecosystem functions affected by the future warming in the cold regions requires more data and knowledge of the subsurface cz structure and hydrological processes while large scale remote sensing model based research has been conducted in cold regions bibi et al 2018 biskaborn et al 2019 frampton et al 2012 gao et al 2019 turetsky et al 2019 yang et al 2019 there are quite few studies that explicitly resolve high resolution deep cz structure and the subsurface flow processes soil to bedrock layer under an integrated framework traditional methods of observing subsurface cz structures and subsurface processes are usually excavation profile boreholes and trenches hahm et al 2019 hu and li 2019 woods and rowe 1996 however using traditional methods cannot reveal the dynamic change of the deep cz structure especially under ft cycles in recent years geophysical techniques such as ground penetrating radar gpr electrical resistivity tomography ert seismic refraction provide alternative ways for high spatial resolution observations of subsurface cz structure befus et al 2011 diallo et al 2019 holbrook et al 2014 st clair et al 2015 nevertheless simultaneous observations of subsurface cz structures and surface subsurface flow processes are still difficult at large scales in cold regions hillslope is a fundamental unit of the landscape system fan et al 2019 the scale of which is suitable for simultaneous observations and feasible to reflecting the nonlinear hydrological processes mcdonnell 2013 sivapalan 2005 detailed hillslope scale research then becomes an effective way to look for common threads or patterns that are needed for upscaling to watershed or regional scale sivapalan 2003 at the large scale variations of the cz structure hydrological processes and vegetation across landscapes are commonly explained by climate and tectonics hahm et al 2019 however hillslope scales have similar on site climatic and tectonics conditions but are strongly controlled by micro climate that differs in micro topography gradient such as aspect gradient from south facing to north facing slope and drainage gradient from top to bottom of the slope or from hill ridge to valley hahm et al 2019 meanwhile as the major controlling factor of subsurface cz structure and hydrological processes previous studies have also reported that micro climate and vegetation have a systematic difference or patterned distribution characteristics regarding aspect gradient bennie et al 2008 dearborn et al 2017 elliott and cowell 2018 swetnam et al 2017 this leads to a hypothesis that subsurface cz structure and hydrological processes also exhibit a systematic difference along micro topography gradient at the hillslope scale although previous studies have suggested that equatorial facing hillslopes tend to be thinner than polar facing hillslopes which however might not be fully applicable to high altitude arid and glacier landscapes poulos et al 2012 west et al 2014 anderson et al 2013 suggested that north facing slopes have intense frost damage process and better developed damage profile in alpine landscapes using model simulation systematical measurements and model simulations of subsurface cz structure surface subsurface flow processes pedological and hydrometric properties in cold regions are still rare that need to be further conducted qtp is a representative of high elevation cold regions which stores a large amount of freshwater that maintains all the major asian rivers supply commonly known as the asian water tower bibi et al 2018 wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2013 it is particularly sensitive to climate change ma et al 2019 qinghai lake the largest saline lake in china is an important water reservoir in the northeastern part of the qtp meanwhile the qinghai lake basin is a closed inland lake basin li et al 2018 in this study we conducted a suite of experiments in the qinghai lake basin critical zone observatory li et al 2018 the observational experiments integrated geophysical and hydrological observations with pedological and hydrometric observations at the hillslope scale the goal is to study the distribution and characteristics of cz structure and runoff regime and their interplays affected by the micro topography gradient specific scientific questions are summarized as follows 1 how is the slope cz structured 2 how subsurface cz structure dominant runoff regime ft processes vary across the entire hillslope drainage gradient and between the north facing and south facing slopes aspect gradient is there a systematic difference on the micro topography gradient 3 how the cz structure and micro topography control the runoff regime and in turn how the runoff regime impacts the cz structure and micro topography this study is expected to help us understand the parameterization of subsurface cz structure the hydrologic processes and their interplay and predict the dynamics of cz across scales under climate change 2 study site the current study was conducted in a small catchment of the qinghai lake basin critical zone observatory which is the first alpine critical zone observatory czo on the qtp in china li et al 2018 the experimental site is located in the qianhuli sub catchment 3737 25 n 100 15 e 8 9 ha of the qinghai lake basin northeast of the qtp fig 1 it is a tributary sub catchment of the shaliu river watershed about 26 km north of the qinghai lake basin with an elevation of 3565 3716 m due to glacial erosion the qianhuli sub catchment is a typical u shaped valley its micro topography can be divided into 3 units the north facing slope the south facing slope and the valley the slope angle and the aspect of the south facing slope the north facing slope and the valley are approximately 30 and 160 35 and 340 19 and 60 respectively measured by gps table 1 the study site experiences a cold and semi arid continental climate dominated by the mid latitude westerlies and the asian summer monsoon wu et al 2019 according to the meteorological records at the gangcha weather station 15 km southwest from the study area from 1958 to 2016 the mean annual evaporation temperature and

experimental design 3 1 geophysical properties 3 1 1 subsurface cz structure and thickness ground penetrating radar gpr was used to detect subsurface cz structure and measure the thickness from the top to the bottom of the hill along the south facing and north facing slope and the valley in september 2018 three gpr lines 70 60 and 25 m on the south facing slope north facing slope and valley respectively were measured by gpr geophysical survey systems inc salem new hampshire sir 3000 terrasir subsurface interface radar with a 200 mhz antenna the gpr data were processed using radan 7 geophysical survey systems inc salem new hampshire radargrams were processed in four steps 1 distance normalization 2 time zero 3 horizontal smoothing and background removal fir filter 4 surface normalization daniels 2004 hand auger was employed to manually survey the depth of the soil layers on the south facing slop the north facing slope and the valley along the gpr lines with an interval of 3 m the excavator was adopted to excavate soil to bedrock profiles and determine the horizons three profiles were excavated at the bottom of the south facing slope north facing slope and middle valley the excavator stopped when un weathered bedrock layer appeared samples were collected for texture soil rock type rock fragment and pedality analysis calibrations of the gpr data by manually measured data are two fold 1 recalculating the propagation velocity of the electromagnetic wave of gpr from the manually measured data 2 recalculating the depth of a specific soil layer using the calibrated propagation velocity of electromagnetic wave the equations for calibration are as follows daniels 2004 1 d 1 i v 1 i t i 2 2 v d 2 i t i 1 2 n 3 d i v t i 2 where d 1 and d 2 are the depths

velocity from manually measured data v is the average propagation velocity of the electromagnetic wave recalculated by the actual depth of the specific soil layer d is the recalculated depth of the specific soil layer finally the latitude longitude and altitude data at an interval of 3 m obtained by gps table 1 were added 3 2 pedological properties bulk density porosity saturated water content swc capillary water content csc field capacity fc unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kus and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks were measured by the ring knife method for soil properties chen 2015 ninety undisturbed soil samples were collected from 6 pits on the south facing and north facing slopes top middle bottom slope at the depths of 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 50 50 70 70 90 and 90 110 cm respectively fig 2 due to the shallow soil layer and the appearance of saprolite layer only 0 30 cm samples were collected in the middle and bottom of the south facing slope hydraulic conductivities were measured by mini disk infiltration instrument decagon usa soil samples were air dried and sieved to 2 mm the soil texture was determined by the hydrometer method ghorbani et al 2019 the gravel was separated from the fine soil with a 2 mm sieve the percent gravel content was determined by 2 mm sieve for each sample ceacero et al 2012 soil water storage sws capacity was calculate based on fc and soil bulk density using the following formula jiao et al 2013 s w s c a p a c i t y 0 1 f c d i h i where fc is field capacity di is soil bulk density g cm 3 hi is the depth of the ith layer cm 3 3 hydrometric properties soil volumetric water content vwc and soil temperature c were monitored by ech2o 5te decagon usa table 1 four ech2os were installed on the north facing and south facing slopes top and bottom of the slope each with five 5te sensors at the depths of 10 30 60 90 and 120 cm respectively all the 5te sensors were calibrated before installation li et al 2013 3 4 surface flow and subsurface flow a runoff area with trenches was built in 2017 for monitoring surface and subsurface flow at the bottom of the south facing and north facing slopes respectively fig 2 steps to construct the runoff area were as follows 1 we selected a section of the hillslope and dug a trench of about 30 cm wide and 60 cm deep at the boundaries of the runoff area 2 a steel sheet of approximately 80 100 cm wide and 1 mm thick was inserted in the trench as the boundary of the runoff plot for surface runoff collection 3 in order to prevent the loss of surface runoff we restored the trench with its original soil that was pressed tightly and flattened at the surface 4 we installed a plastic hose at the downhill end of the runoff plot for surface flow collection the length and width of the runoff area of the south and north facing slopes are 70 m 5 m and 58 m 5 m respectively the building procedure of the trough collection system was as follows fig 2 1 we dug a trench at the downhill end of the runoff area leaving an open regolith profile 2 according to the distribution of the impeding layer the trough collection system was customized and firstly equipped at the bottom of the trench bedrock interface 3 we installed a plastic hose at the end of the trough to collect and direct subsurface flow to the rain gauge 4 in order to prevent the trench from collapsing and the influence of air temperature on the internal temperature of the cz we restored the trough and the trench with its original material 5 the second and the third trough collection system were equipped in a bottom up order of the trench according to the actual cz horizon three troughs were equipped at the trench on the north facing slope while two troughs were equipped at the trench on the south facing slope detailed information of the trench and trough collection system were summarized in table 2 surface flow was monitored by tipping buckets while subsurface flow was monitored by rain gauge rg3 m decagon usa two cr800 datalogger were used to record the runoff processes at 5 minute intervals on north facing and south facing slopes table 1 4 results 4 1 subsurface cz structure and soil texture exploration the thickness of cz on the north facing slope 350 cm is larger than that on the south facing slope 200 cm fig 3 and table 3 the sod layer on the north facing slope is loose while dense on the south facing slope there are 2 distinct impending layers in the cz profile excluding bedrock layer of the north facing slope but only 1 inconspicuous impending layer in the south facing slope the impending layer ranges from 50 to 80 cm b horizon 160 200 cm bottom of c1 horizon in the north facing slope and from 20 to 40 cm b horizon in the south facing slope the weathered bedrock layer in the north facing slope has very large pores and contains very few soil grains while in the south facing slope it has small pores and contains a large amount of soil grains there is a thin soil layer deposited in the location of the weathered bedrock layer with abrupt changes in porosity in the north facing slope fig 3 n facing bottom near c1 in the valley sod layer is thick and relatively loose the valley has the largest soil thickness 0 140 cm among the three north facing south facing slope and valley permafrost was found in the middle of the valley excavator could not dig further due to the permafrost layer at 140 cm below surface calibrated gpr data is shown in fig 4 and table 3 the radargrams of the hillslope structure after adding the elevation is shown in fig 5 the depth of the layer detected by gpr is consistent with that using the method of excavation profile three layers soil saprolite and weathered bedrock layer are shown on both south facing and north facing radargrams figs 4 and 5 the thickness of cz in the study area is thinner the average depth of soil saprolite and weathered bedrock layer are 0 4 1 4 2 5 m in the south facing slope and 0 7 1 8 3 5 m in the north facing slope respectively the average soil layer thickness in the valley is 1 7 m table 3 the thickness of the soil layer shows a decreasing trend while the thickness of the saprolite layer shows an increasing trend from top to bottom of the south facing slope fig 6 a however no obvious trends are observed on the thickness of soil saprolite nor the weathered bedrock layer on the north facing slope fig 6b in the valley there is an increasing trend on the thickness of the soil layer from top to bottom of the hill table 3 4 2 pedological analysis the soil texture of the north facing slope is finer than that of the south facing slope fig 7 both north facing and south facing slope soil texture gradually becomes coarse as the cz depth increases however the soil texture tends to be finer at depths of 90 cm and 180 cm in the north facing slope fig 7b the gravel content in the south facing slope increases sharply at 20 50 cm while at 50 110 cm in the north facing slope on the south facing slope surficial soil has small infiltration and hydraulic conductivity but large storage capacity however deep soil has small storage capacity but large hydraulic conductivity fig 8 contrary to the south facing slope the surficial soil has large infiltration hydraulic conductivity and storage capacity but the deep soil has small hydraulic conductivity and storage capacity and storage capacity on the north facing slope the bulk density fig 8a b increases with the increase of soil depth but soil porosity fig 8c d swc fig 8e f csc fig 8g h fc fig 8i j and ks fig 8k l all decrease with the increase of soil depth in both slopes the swc csc and fc of all samples point at 0 10 cm below surface are greater than 100 the average ks on the south facing slope is 1 9 times larger than the north facing slope fig 8k l the kus on the south facing slope is 3 4 times larger than that of the north facing slope fig 8m n the mean soil water storage capacity of the south facing and north facing slope are 321 3 and 443 9 mm fig 9 the mean soil water storage capacity on s top is significantly larger than that of the s middle and s bottom n top and n bottom are significantly larger than n middle 4 3 hydrometric analysis 4 3 1 soil volumetric water content mean annual vwc of the north facing slope is 0 05 m3 m 3 higher than south facing slope fig 10 mean annual vwc at the s top is 0 07 m3 m 3 higher than the s bottom fig 10 a b but the n top is 0 01 m3 m 3 lower than the n bottom fig 10 c d on the north facing slope the deep soil has higher vwc than the intermediate soil on the south facing slope intermediate soil 40 70 cm has the highest vwc on the s top but the vwc decreases with the increase of the soil depth on the s bottom 4 3 2 freeze thaw process the south facing slope have higher mean annual soil temperature and shorter duration of the ft process than the north facing slope fig 11 the mean annual soil temperature of 10 120 cm below surface on the s top and s bottom is 4 2 6 6 c on the n top and n bottom is 2 5 2 7 c respectively the duration of the ft process on the s top and s bottom are 161 and 123 d respectively on the n top and n bottom are 254 and 249 d respectively table 3 on the south facing slope mean annual soil temperature and the duration of the ft process of the s bottom is 2 4 c lower and 38 d short than the s top respectively fig 11a b however there is almost no significant difference between n bottom and n top fig 11c d 4 4 surface and subsurface flow the runoff depth of surface and subsurface flow on the south facing are 0 47 mm and 0 10 mm runoff depth of the ssf1 and ssf2 are 0 07 and 0 03 mm on the north facing slope are 0 24 mm and 5 06 mm runoff depth of the ssf1 ssf2 and ssf3 are 2 39 1 80 and 0 87 mm respectively fig 12 the total runoff depth surface and subsurface flow of the north facing slope is 11 0 times that of the south facing slope the percentages of surface flow and subsurface flow in total runoff on the north slope are 97 9 and 2 1 on the north slope are 4 5 and 94 5 respectively 5 discussion we found that under the same climatic and tectonics conditions systematical differences of subsurface cz structure and dominating runoff regime were observed on two aspect slopes here we discuss the characteristics of the subsurface cz structure in the study area and the impact of micro topography on the interplay between subsurface cz structure and hydrologic processes at the hillslope scale on the qtp we also present a conceptual model to illustrate the patterns and interplays mentioned above 5 1 subsurface cz structure vwc ft processes and their distribution characteristics across micro topography gradient the subsurface cz structure data show that the thickness of cz in the study area is relatively thin 2 3 5 m and the cz in the north facing slope is systematically thicker than that in the south facing slope previous studies stated that the global average cz thickness of the continental areas is 36 8 m xu and liu 2017 the average of cz thickness is roughly 15 m in in boulder creek czo station of colorado usa befus et al 2011 but 104 6 m in loess plateau of china shao et al 2018 it is known that weathering rates mainly depend on regional climate and rock mineral type and climate xu and liu 2017 found that the thickness of subsurface cz reflects effective energy and mass transfer relatively small effective energy and mass transfer were observed in water and energy limited regions rasmussen et al 2010 in addition granodiorite and monzonitic granite were found to be the main rock types in our study site which has a low weathering rate rossi and graham 2010 compared with our study area the boulder creek and loess plateau have higher temperature or precipitation therefore the low temperature low precipitation and rock type may be the main reasons for the relatively thinner cz in our study area than in the boulder creek and loess plateau in the boulder creek czo the alpines have low mean annual temperature and precipitation leading to thinner cz than the plains befus et al 2011 which is also supporting our results the north facing slope shows systematically higher vwc lower soil temperature and longer duration of the ft processes than the south facing slope at the hillslope scale topography can affect microclimates and constrain vegetation distributions hahm et al 2019 although currently we do not have meteorological data on both north facing and south facing slopes to support our speculations the difference of meteorological conditions caused by micro topography has been mentioned by many previous studies fekedulegn et al 2003 sariyildiz et al 2005 for example the aspect can change local solar angle and the intensity of solar radiation received at the hillslope surface and then further influence temperature air and soil soil moisture et and humidity fekedulegn et al 2003 gutiérrez jurado and vivoni 2013 sariyildiz et al 2005 the south facing slope receives more intense solar radiation and tend to be drier and warmer than the north facing slope in the northern hemisphere especially far from the equator fekedulegn et al 2003 systematically difference of the vwc and soil temperature will inevitably change the vegetation types in water and energy limited regions sunny slope generally intend to support plants with longer growing seasons and low productivity while shady slope generally supports plants with shorter growing seasons and higher productivity fan et al 2019 this is observed and well explained in our study the vegetation types on the north facing and south facing slope are alpine shrub and alpine meadow with dominant species as salix oritrepha potentilla fruticosa and kobresia pygmaea respectively differences in vegetation types will strongly affect soil structure and pedological properties higher vwc and longer duration of the ft processes indicate better subsurface flow generation conditions in the north facing slope this also explains in one way why the s top is drier than the s bottom but the n top is wetter than the n bottom the thickness of subsurface cz in the north facing slope is systematically thicker than that in the south facing slope for a long time it has been widely considered that mechanical weathering is the main type of weathering in cold regions which is due to ft and thermal stresses hall and thorn 2011 hall et al 2002 however recent research also claimed that moisture availability is the primary limiting factor rather than temperature hall 2013 the diurnal ft cycles are rapid but shallow while the annual ft cycles are deep yet of low frequency goodfellow 2013 the deep cz temperature is often significantly higher than air temperature mechanical weathering is overestimated and chemical or biological weathering may be more prevalent than is usually assumed hall 2013 the north facing slope has higher vwc and deeper root vegetation shrub which leads to stronger chemical weathering and biological process that may thicken the subsurface cz of the north facing slope hall et al 2005 found that there is a distinct aspect influence on the biological weathering processes and the order of weathering degree on the slope aspect is usually south west north east in kunlun mountains of china which is consistent with our results from our results we conclude that generally the cz on north facing slope is thicker than that in the south facing slope which may require further research on the qtp 5 2 subsurface cz structure and pedological properties controls on dominant runoff regime subsurface cz structure and pedological properties both control the runoff generation our results show that the south facing slope is dominated by surface flow however the north facing slope is dominated by subsurface flow this is due to the difference in the subsurface cz structure and pedological properties of the two slopes which are also well illustrated by our observation results at the hillslope scale micro topography can influence microclimates constrain vegetation distributions and then affect subsurface cz structure and pedological properties our results show that the infiltration capacity of the surficial soil is poor in the south facing slope and strong in the north facing slope this may be due to the difference in vegetation types of two slopes on the south facing slope the vegetation type is alpine meadow the sod layer is very hard and contains dense fine grass roots however on the north facing slope the vegetation type is alpine shrub the surficial soil is loose and contains thicker roots this causes precipitation to easily penetrate into the soil on the north facing slope but difficult on the south facing slope the flux capacity of the deep soil is strong in the south facing slope and weak in the north facing slope this is mainly because of the thin soil layer on the south facing slope with coarse textured deep soil however the soil layer on the north facing slope is thick and the deep soil has a very fine texture in the deep soil layer of the south facing slope the water is more likely to be vertically infiltrated while in the deep soil layer of the north facing slope the water easily accumulates on the impending layer to form lateral subsurface flow since similar climatic and tectonics conditions exist at the hillslope scale vegetation type has become one of the keys controlling factors affecting hillslope pedological properties and rainfall runoff processes dearborn et al 2017 elliott and cowell 2018 fan et al 2019 our results indicate that the dominated runoff regime may also have a patterned distribution feature on the slope gradient 5 3 subsurface cz structure and micro topography shaped by runoff processes the subsurface cz structure on the south facing slope is significantly different from that on the north facing slope our results show that on the south facing slope 1 the thickness of the soil layer shows a decreasing trend from top to bottom of the slope 2 the weathered bedrock layer has small pores and contains a large amount of soil particles 3 there is only one 1 inconspicuous impending layer in the subsurface cz however on the north facing slope 1 no obvious trends are observed on the thickness of soil saprolite and the weathered bedrock layer from top to bottom of the slope 2 the weathered bedrock layer has very large pores and contains very few soil particles 3 there are 2 distinct impending layers in the cz profile meanwhile we also found 12 landslides and obvious slope creep and solifluction on the north facing slope runoff and its associated physical chemical and biological processes are one of the important factors in the evolution of the cz structure and topography the difference of the subsurface cz structure and thickness across the south facing slope and north facing slope can be explained as the result of different dominant runoff regimes runoff and its associated physical chemical and biological processes are one of the important factors in the evolution of the cz structure and topography the south facing slope has less runoff and is dominated by surface runoff surface runoff erosion process may lead to the thickness of soil layer gradually decreased from top to bottom of the slope vertical infiltration process in cz may cause the weathered bedrock layer containing much soil and sand particles conversely the north facing slope has more runoff and is dominated by lateral subsurface runoff weak surface runoff processes lead to no obvious trends in soil thickness from top to bottom of the slope the weak vertical infiltration process causes a small amount of soil particles to migrate downward and deposit in the weathered bedrock layer with smaller pores this explains the large pore few soil particles of the weathered bedrock layer and the formation of the second impending layer in subsurface cz strong lateral subsurface flow processes and high vwc cause sediment to migrate primarily in the lateral direction and cause strong landslides slope creep and solifluction processes on the north facing slope however in the shale hills critical zone observatory the north facing slopes mantled with thicker regolith as compared to the south facing slope but the regolith thickness is increasing from top hill to the valley on both north and south facing slopes west et al 2014 which is contrary to our results mainly due to the difference of vegetation type and climate condition the shale hills czo is a forested temperate climate catchment and the mean annual precipitation is 1070 mm guo et al 2019 forest ecosystems prevent runoff erosion and deposit soil grains along the downhill direction leading to a gradual increase in the thickness of regolith from top hill to the valley however in cold and semi arid regions the main vegetation types of the qtp are herbs and shrubs which may lead to weaker runoff processes and soil conservation capacity compared to the shale hills czo our results indicate that under the climate change and grassland permafrost degradation the south facing slope is more inclined to occur grassland degradation and desertification and the north facing slope more inclined to occur landslide and debris flow disasters 5 4 conceptual model illustrating patterns and interplays between subsurface cz structure and dominant runoff regime across micro topography in qtp topography can affect microclimates and constrain vegetation distributions subsurface cz structure and vegetation govern the hydrological processes by pedological properties in turn hydrologic processes and climate influence the topography landscapes by affecting weathering and erosion processes sullivan et al 2017 as an important controlling factor for cz and runoff formation previous studies have found the microclimate and vegetation patterns on the aspect gradient based on the experimental results described above we propose that there are also subsurface cz structure and dominant runoff regime patterns on the aspect gradient fig 13 along topographic gradient as the slope aspect shifted from 0 or 360 south facing to 180 north facing it received weaker solar radiation along the hillslope fig 13a the hillslope temperature gradually decreases and the vwc gradually increases the dominant vegetation types gradually change from longer growing seasons lower productivity plant alpine meadow to shorter growing seasons higher productivity plant alpine shrub as the water availability and root depth gradually increases herb to shrub the thickness of cz gradually also increases as the slope aspect shifts from 0 or 360 south facing sunny to 180 north facing shady meanwhile the dominant runoff regime gradually changes from surface flow to subsurface flow fig 13b sunny slope tends to have hard sod layer and shallow regolith layer causing them to be dominated with surface runoff and a relatively strong vertical infiltration process in cz surface runoff erosion process led to the thickness of soil layer gradually decreasing on the drainage gradient conversely shady slope tends to have loose sod layer and thick soil layer with lower hydraulic conductivity causing the shady slope be dominated with lateral subsurface flow and have minimal surface flow processes strong lateral subsurface flow processes and high vwc lead to active soil loss and landslides on the shady slope because the surface runoff process is too weak the soil layer thickness does not change significantly on the drainage gradient due to lateral confluence the vwc of bottom of the slope is higher than other locations along the slope our observations vividly illustrated the interaction mechanism among subsurface cz structure hydrological processes and topography on hillslope scale the simulation results of alpine landscape in the boulder creek czo show that north facing slopes have better developed damage profile anderson et al 2013 which are consistent with our hypothesis however due to the spatial heterogeneity of the cz structure across the landscape more gpr surveys and hydrological observations are still needed on other slopes to prove this hypothesis on the qtp conducting direct observation experiments of subsurface cz structure and subsurface hydrological processes is challenging in cold regions due to the harsh environment and risk however it is extremely imperative because of its important ecological functions sensitive response and potential remarkable feedbacks on climate change in recent years deep cz structure has been mapped by multiple geophysical methods such as gpr ert and seismic refraction befus et al 2011 brantley et al 2016 diallo et al 2019 st clair et al 2015 thayer et al 2018 however almost none of those studies have directly monitor subsurface flow processes in the entire cz profile soil to bedrock which hinders our further understanding and assessing hydrological processes and the impact of climate change this study is a demonstration of the relations among the subsurface cz structure hydrological processes and micro topography on a headwater sub catchment in the qtp we used gpr to detect the continuous cz structure across full hillslope more importantly we designed a trough collection system fig 2 to monitor subsurface flow processes this system could avoid the influence of the air temperature on the ft activities of subsurface based on this system we could continuously monitor the actual flow process of subsurface cz with at any time of a year due to the relatively thin thickness of the cz of the qtp we can monitor the subsurface flow generation process of the entire cz profile soil to bedrock we hope that our method could promote the associated research in cold regions and benefit more field experiments to directly observe subsurface flow processes in the future 6 conclusions this study comprehensively observed the cz architecture and hydrological processes at the hillslope scale to understand their interplays along topographic gradient on the qtp the main findings are as follows 1 subsurface cz structure ft processes and dominant runoff regime exhibits systematic differences between the north facing and the south facing slope 2 the subsurface cz structure and micro topography cause the hydrological processes on the south facing slope is dominated by surface flow while those on the north facing slope is dominated by subsurface flow 3 in turn the dominant runoff regime leads to a decrease of thickness of the soil layer from the top to the bottom of the south facing slope with severe slope creep and landslides on the north facing slope from the experimental results we proposed that the systematic differences of the subsurface cz structure and dominant runoff regime along the micro topographic gradient at the hillslope scale may become a general pattern in larger scales as illustrated in the conceptual model nevertheless future cz research needs to be conducted across ecosystems on the qtp credit authorship contribution statement guang rong hu carried out the experiment

5750,as the third pole of the earth qinghai tibet plateau qtp has been significantly affected by climate change which makes it an ideal and unique site for critical zone cz research however we have limited knowledge of the subsurface cz structure hydrologic processes and their interplays due to extremely scarce observations in such a harsh environment in this study we performed a suite of hillslope scale experiments that integrated geophysical hydrological pedological and hydrometric observations to investigate the characteristics of the subsurface cz structure hydrologic processes pedological attributes and their interplays influenced by micro topography the results reveal that the subsurface cz structure and pedological attributes exhibit systematic differences in the aspect gradient north facing and south facing slope the thickness of the soil saprolite weathered layer on the north facing slope is 0 3 m 0 2 m 0 6 m thicker than that of the south facing slope the soil porosity saturated water content capillary water content field capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity of the shallow soil layer 0 10 cm in the north facing slope is 77 2 140 1 128 2 125 8 0 67 mm min 1 which is 8 7 26 3 24 0 22 6 0 52 mm min 1 larger than those of the south facing slope in contrast those properties of the deep soil layer 80 90 cm in the north facing slope is 44 3 34 3 32 0 29 8 0 06 mm min 1 which is 11 5 19 8 21 0 18 7 0 28 mm min 1 smaller than those of the south facing slope the bulk density of the shallow soil layer in the north facing slope is 0 54 g cm 3 which is 0 06 g cm 3 smaller than that of the south facing slope in contrast the bulk density of the deep soil layer is 1 30 g cm 3 which is 0 26 g cm 3 larger than that of the south facing slope the subsurface cz structure and micro topography cause the hydrological processes on the south facing slope is dominated by surface flow while those on the north facing slope is dominated by subsurface flow the subsurface flow on the north facing slope accounts for 94 5 of the total runoff while the surface flow on the south facing slope accounts for 97 9 of the total runoff in turn the dominant runoff regime leads to a decrease of thickness of the soil layer from the top to the bottom of the south facing slope with severe slope creep and landslides on the north facing slope our results suggest that the subsurface cz structure and dominating runoff regime are significantly affected by the micro topography gradient which should be parameterized for large scale research keywords earth critical zone soil structure hydrological processes micro topography geophysics qinghai tibet plateau 1 introduction cold regions such as polar sub polar regions high latitudes and the third pole regions high altitudes play a crucial role in human earth systems and its sustainable development bibi et al 2018 bring et al 2016 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 yao et al 2019 cold regions have gained increasing attention in the past few decades due to its important ecological functions and remarkable changes impacted by climate change biskaborn et al 2019 gao et al 2019 hinzman et al 2013 immerzeel et al 2010 yang et al 2019 understanding subsurface critical zone cz extends from the top of the vegetative canopy through the soil and down to the bedrock till the bottom of the groundwater structure hydrological processes and their interplays are seen as critical elements under climate change which however is poorly understand in cold regions angermann et al 2017 brooks et al 2015 guo and lin 2016 jackisch et al 2017 white et al 2015 yang et al 2019 due to the difficulties in direct observations and the harsh environment the lack of integrated observational studies and data of subsurface cz structures and hydrological processes is the main challenge in cold region research li et al 2018 yang et al 2019 yao et al 2019 the hydrogeologic processes in cold regions are complicated due to coupled hydro thermal mechanical chemical and freeze thaw ft processes within the wide spread frozen ground cheng and jin 2012 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 yang et al 2010 for example frozen ground is often considered as a relatively impermeable layer which inhibits infiltration and promotes surface and subsurface flow generation carey and woo 2005 koch et al 2014 yamazaki et al 2006 the thawing front in the active layer moves progressively due to seasonally dynamic thermal condition frozen ground or permafrost can inhibit the exchange of surface water walvoord and kurylyk 2016 wright 2008 zhao et al 2000 in the past few decades hydrological process and hydrogeologic properties in cold regions have been greatly altered by climate change such as glacier retreat gao et al 2019 wang et al 2015 yao et al 2007 snow melt dai et al 2017 and permafrost degradation frampton et al 2012 ishikawa et al 2018 ran et al 2018 yang et al 2010 which will future impact regional runoff streamflow magnitude and seasonality water storage capacity and service of the cz frampton et al 2012 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 yang et al 2010 therefore understanding the dynamic changes of the water resources and ecosystem functions affected by the future warming in the cold regions requires more data and knowledge of the subsurface cz structure and hydrological processes while large scale remote sensing model based research has been conducted in cold regions bibi et al 2018 biskaborn et al 2019 frampton et al 2012 gao et al 2019 turetsky et al 2019 yang et al 2019 there are quite few studies that explicitly resolve high resolution deep cz structure and the subsurface flow processes soil to bedrock layer under an integrated framework traditional methods of observing subsurface cz structures and subsurface processes are usually excavation profile boreholes and trenches hahm et al 2019 hu and li 2019 woods and rowe 1996 however using traditional methods cannot reveal the dynamic change of the deep cz structure especially under ft cycles in recent years geophysical techniques such as ground penetrating radar gpr electrical resistivity tomography ert seismic refraction provide alternative ways for high spatial resolution observations of subsurface cz structure befus et al 2011 diallo et al 2019 holbrook et al 2014 st clair et al 2015 nevertheless simultaneous observations of subsurface cz structures and surface subsurface flow processes are still difficult at large scales in cold regions hillslope is a fundamental unit of the landscape system fan et al 2019 the scale of which is suitable for simultaneous observations and feasible to reflecting the nonlinear hydrological processes mcdonnell 2013 sivapalan 2005 detailed hillslope scale research then becomes an effective way to look for common threads or patterns that are needed for upscaling to watershed or regional scale sivapalan 2003 at the large scale variations of the cz structure hydrological processes and vegetation across landscapes are commonly explained by climate and tectonics hahm et al 2019 however hillslope scales have similar on site climatic and tectonics conditions but are strongly controlled by micro climate that differs in micro topography gradient such as aspect gradient from south facing to north facing slope and drainage gradient from top to bottom of the slope or from hill ridge to valley hahm et al 2019 meanwhile as the major controlling factor of subsurface cz structure and hydrological processes previous studies have also reported that micro climate and vegetation have a systematic difference or patterned distribution characteristics regarding aspect gradient bennie et al 2008 dearborn et al 2017 elliott and cowell 2018 swetnam et al 2017 this leads to a hypothesis that subsurface cz structure and hydrological processes also exhibit a systematic difference along micro topography gradient at the hillslope scale although previous studies have suggested that equatorial facing hillslopes tend to be thinner than polar facing hillslopes which however might not be fully applicable to high altitude arid and glacier landscapes poulos et al 2012 west et al 2014 anderson et al 2013 suggested that north facing slopes have intense frost damage process and better developed damage profile in alpine landscapes using model simulation systematical measurements and model simulations of subsurface cz structure surface subsurface flow processes pedological and hydrometric properties in cold regions are still rare that need to be further conducted qtp is a representative of high elevation cold regions which stores a large amount of freshwater that maintains all the major asian rivers supply commonly known as the asian water tower bibi et al 2018 wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2013 it is particularly sensitive to climate change ma et al 2019 qinghai lake the largest saline lake in china is an important water reservoir in the northeastern part of the qtp meanwhile the qinghai lake basin is a closed inland lake basin li et al 2018 in this study we conducted a suite of experiments in the qinghai lake basin critical zone observatory li et al 2018 the observational experiments integrated geophysical and hydrological observations with pedological and hydrometric observations at the hillslope scale the goal is to study the distribution and characteristics of cz structure and runoff regime and their interplays affected by the micro topography gradient specific scientific questions are summarized as follows 1 how is the slope cz structured 2 how subsurface cz structure dominant runoff regime ft processes vary across the entire hillslope drainage gradient and between the north facing and south facing slopes aspect gradient is there a systematic difference on the micro topography gradient 3 how the cz structure and micro topography control the runoff regime and in turn how the runoff regime impacts the cz structure and micro topography this study is expected to help us understand the parameterization of subsurface cz structure the hydrologic processes and their interplay and predict the dynamics of cz across scales under climate change 2 study site the current study was conducted in a small catchment of the qinghai lake basin critical zone observatory which is the first alpine critical zone observatory czo on the qtp in china li et al 2018 the experimental site is located in the qianhuli sub catchment 3737 25 n 100 15 e 8 9 ha of the qinghai lake basin northeast of the qtp fig 1 it is a tributary sub catchment of the shaliu river watershed about 26 km north of the qinghai lake basin with an elevation of 3565 3716 m due to glacial erosion the qianhuli sub catchment is a typical u shaped valley its micro topography can be divided into 3 units the north facing slope the south facing slope and the valley the slope angle and the aspect of the south facing slope the north facing slope and the valley are approximately 30

experimental design 3 1 geophysical properties 3 1 1 subsurface cz structure and thickness ground penetrating radar gpr was used to detect subsurface cz structure and measure the thickness from the top to the bottom of the hill along the south facing and north facing slope and the valley in september 2018 three gpr lines 70 60 and 25 m on the south facing slope north facing slope and valley respectively were measured by gpr geophysical survey systems inc salem new hampshire sir 3000 terrasir subsurface interface radar with a 200 mhz antenna the gpr data were processed using radan 7 geophysical survey systems inc salem new hampshire radargrams were processed in four steps 1 distance normalization 2 time zero 3 horizontal smoothing and background removal fir filter 4 surface normalization daniels 2004 hand auger was employed to manually survey the depth of the soil layers on the south facing slop the north facing slope and the valley along the gpr lines with an interval of 3 m the excavator was adopted to excavate soil to bedrock profiles and determine the horizons three profiles were excavated at the bottom of the south facing slope north facing slope and middle valley the excavator stopped when un weathered bedrock layer appeared samples were collected for texture soil rock type rock fragment and pedality analysis calibrations of the gpr data by manually measured data are two fold 1 recalculating the propagation velocity of the electromagnetic wave of gpr from the manually measured data 2 recalculating the depth of a specific soil layer using the calibrated propagation velocity of electromagnetic wave the equations for calibration are as follows daniels 2004 1 d 1 i v 1 i t i 2 2 v d 2 i t i 1 2 n 3 d i v t i 2 where d 1 and d 2 are the depths

swc capillary water content csc field capacity fc unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kus and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks were measured by the ring knife method for soil properties chen 2015 ninety undisturbed soil samples were collected from 6 pits on the south facing and north facing slopes top middle bottom slope at the depths of 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 50 50 70 70 90 and 90 110 cm respectively fig 2 due to the shallow soil layer and the appearance of saprolite layer only 0 30 cm samples were collected in the middle and bottom of the south facing slope hydraulic conductivities were measured by mini disk infiltration instrument decagon usa soil samples were air dried and sieved to 2 mm the soil texture was determined by the hydrometer method ghorbani et al 2019 the gravel was separated from the fine soil with a 2 mm sieve the percent gravel content was determined by 2 mm sieve for each sample ceacero et al 2012 soil water storage sws capacity was calculate based on fc

3 hydrometric properties soil volumetric water content vwc and soil temperature c were monitored by ech2o 5te decagon usa table 1 four ech2os were installed on the north facing and south facing slopes top and bottom of the slope each with five 5te sensors at the depths of 10 30 60 90 and 120 cm respectively all the 5te sensors were calibrated before installation li et al 2013 3 4 surface flow and subsurface flow a runoff area with trenches was built in 2017 for monitoring surface and subsurface flow at the bottom of the south facing and north facing slopes respectively fig 2 steps to construct the runoff area were as follows 1 we selected a section of the hillslope and dug a trench of about 30 cm wide and 60 cm deep at the boundaries of the runoff area 2 a steel sheet of approximately 80 100 cm wide and 1 mm thick was inserted in the trench as the boundary of the runoff plot for surface runoff collection 3 in order to prevent the loss of surface runoff we restored the trench with its original soil that was pressed tightly and flattened at the surface 4 we installed a plastic hose at the downhill end of the runoff plot for surface flow collection the length and width of the runoff area of the south and north facing slopes are 70 m 5 m and 58 m 5 m respectively the building procedure of the trough collection system was as follows fig 2 1 we dug a trench at the downhill end of the runoff area leaving an open regolith profile 2 according to the distribution of the impeding layer the trough collection system was customized and firstly equipped at the bottom of the trench bedrock interface 3 we installed a plastic hose at the end of the trough to collect and direct subsurface flow to the rain gauge 4 in order to prevent the trench from collapsing and the influence of air temperature on the internal temperature of the cz we restored the trough and the trench with its original material 5 the second and the third trough collection system were equipped in a bottom up order of the trench according to the actual cz horizon three troughs were equipped at the trench on the north facing slope while two troughs were equipped at the trench on the south facing slope detailed information of the trench and trough collection system were summarized in table 2 surface flow was monitored by tipping buckets while subsurface flow was monitored by rain gauge rg3 m decagon usa two cr800 datalogger were used to record the runoff processes at 5 minute intervals on north facing and south facing slopes table 1 4 results 4 1 subsurface cz structure and soil texture exploration the thickness of cz on the north facing slope 350 cm is larger than that on the south facing slope 200 cm fig 3 and table 3 the sod layer on the north facing slope is loose while dense on the south facing slope there are 2 distinct impending layers in the cz profile excluding bedrock layer of the north facing slope but only 1 inconspicuous impending layer in the south facing slope the impending layer ranges from 50 to 80 cm b horizon 160 200 cm bottom of c1 horizon in the north facing slope and from 20 to 40 cm b horizon in the south facing slope the weathered bedrock layer in the north facing slope has very large pores and contains very few soil grains while in the south facing slope it has small pores and contains a large amount of soil grains there is a thin soil layer deposited in the location of the weathered bedrock layer with abrupt changes in porosity in the north facing slope fig 3 n facing bottom near c1 in the valley sod layer is thick and relatively loose the valley has the largest soil thickness 0 140 cm among the three north facing south facing slope and valley permafrost was found in the middle of the valley excavator could not dig further due to the permafrost layer at 140 cm below surface calibrated gpr data is shown in fig 4 and table 3 the radargrams of the hillslope structure after adding the elevation is shown in fig 5 the depth of the layer detected by gpr is consistent with that using the method of excavation profile three layers soil saprolite and weathered bedrock layer are shown on both south facing and north facing radargrams figs 4 and 5 the thickness of cz in the study area is thinner the average depth of soil saprolite and weathered bedrock layer are 0 4 1 4 2 5 m in the south facing slope and 0 7 1 8 3 5 m in the north facing slope respectively the average soil layer thickness in the valley is 1 7 m table 3 the thickness of the soil layer shows a decreasing trend while the thickness of the saprolite layer shows an increasing trend from top to bottom of the south facing slope fig 6 a however no obvious trends are observed on the thickness of soil saprolite nor the weathered bedrock layer on the north facing slope fig 6b in the valley there is an increasing trend on the thickness of the soil layer from top to bottom of the hill table 3 4 2 pedological analysis the soil texture of the north facing slope is finer than that of the south facing slope fig 7 both north facing and south facing slope soil texture gradually becomes coarse as the cz depth increases however the soil texture tends to be finer at depths of 90 cm and 180 cm in the north facing slope fig 7b the gravel content in the south facing slope increases sharply at 20 50 cm while at 50 110 cm in the north facing slope on the south facing slope surficial soil has small infiltration and hydraulic conductivity but large storage capacity however deep soil has small storage capacity but large hydraulic conductivity fig 8 contrary to the south facing slope the surficial soil has large infiltration hydraulic conductivity and storage capacity but the deep soil has small hydraulic conductivity and storage capacity and storage capacity on the north facing slope the bulk density fig 8a b increases with the increase of soil depth but soil porosity fig 8c d swc fig 8e f csc fig 8g h fc fig 8i j and ks fig 8k l all decrease with the increase of soil depth in both slopes the swc csc and fc of all samples point at 0 10 cm below surface are greater than 100 the average ks on the south facing slope is 1 9 times larger than the north facing slope fig 8k l the kus on the south facing slope is 3 4 times larger than that of the north facing slope fig 8m n the mean soil water storage capacity of the south facing and north facing slope are 321 3 and 443 9 mm fig 9 the mean soil water storage capacity on s top is significantly larger than that of the s middle and s bottom n top and n bottom are significantly larger than n middle 4 3 hydrometric analysis 4 3 1 soil volumetric water content mean annual vwc of the north facing slope is 0 05 m3 m 3 higher than south facing slope fig 10 mean annual vwc at the s top is 0 07 m3 m 3 higher than the s bottom fig 10 a b but the n top is 0 01 m3 m 3 lower than the n bottom fig 10 c d on the north facing slope the deep soil has higher vwc than the intermediate soil on the south facing slope intermediate soil 40 70 cm has the highest vwc on the s top but the vwc decreases with the increase of the soil depth on the s bottom 4 3 2 freeze thaw process the south facing slope have higher mean annual soil temperature and shorter duration of the ft process than the north facing slope fig 11 the mean annual soil temperature of 10 120 cm below surface on the s top and s bottom is 4 2 6 6 c on the n top and n bottom is 2 5 2 7 c respectively the duration of the ft process on the s top and s bottom are 161 and 123 d respectively on the n top and n bottom are 254 and 249 d respectively table 3 on the south facing slope mean annual soil temperature and the duration of the ft process of the s bottom is 2 4 c lower and 38 d short than the s top respectively fig 11a b however there is almost no significant difference between n bottom and n top fig 11c d 4 4 surface and subsurface flow the runoff depth of surface and subsurface flow on the south facing are 0 47 mm and 0 10 mm runoff depth of the ssf1 and ssf2 are 0 07 and 0 03 mm on the north facing slope are 0 24 mm and 5 06 mm runoff depth of the ssf1 ssf2 and ssf3 are 2 39 1 80 and 0 87 mm respectively fig 12 the total runoff depth surface and subsurface flow of the north facing slope is 11 0 times that of the south facing slope the percentages of surface flow and subsurface flow in total runoff on the north slope are 97 9 and 2 1 on the north slope are 4 5 and 94 5 respectively 5 discussion we found that under the same climatic and tectonics conditions systematical differences of subsurface cz structure and dominating runoff regime were observed on two aspect slopes here we discuss the characteristics of the subsurface cz structure in the study area and the impact of micro topography on the interplay between subsurface cz structure and hydrologic processes at the hillslope scale on the qtp we also present a conceptual model to illustrate the patterns and interplays mentioned above 5 1 subsurface cz structure vwc ft processes and their distribution characteristics across micro topography gradient the subsurface cz structure data show that the thickness of cz in the study area is relatively thin 2 3 5 m and the cz in the north facing slope is systematically thicker than that in the south facing slope previous studies stated that the global average cz thickness of the continental areas is 36 8 m xu and liu 2017 the average of cz thickness is roughly 15 m in in boulder creek czo station of colorado usa befus et al 2011 but 104 6 m in loess plateau of china shao et al 2018 it is known that weathering rates mainly depend on regional climate and rock mineral type and climate xu and liu 2017 found that the thickness of subsurface cz reflects effective energy and mass transfer relatively small effective energy and mass transfer were observed in water and energy limited regions rasmussen et al 2010 in addition granodiorite and monzonitic granite were found to be the main rock types in our study site which has a low weathering rate rossi and graham 2010 compared with our study area the boulder creek and loess plateau have higher temperature or precipitation therefore the low temperature low precipitation and rock type may be the main reasons for the relatively thinner cz in our study area than in the boulder creek and loess plateau in the boulder creek czo the alpines have low mean annual temperature and precipitation leading to thinner cz than the plains befus et al 2011 which is also supporting our results the north facing slope shows systematically higher vwc lower soil temperature and longer duration of the ft processes than the south facing slope at the hillslope scale topography can affect microclimates and constrain vegetation distributions hahm et al 2019 although currently we do not have meteorological data on both north facing and south facing slopes to support our speculations the difference of meteorological conditions caused by micro topography has been mentioned by many previous studies fekedulegn et al 2003 sariyildiz et al 2005 for example the aspect can change local solar angle and the intensity of solar radiation received at the hillslope surface and then further influence temperature air and soil soil moisture et and humidity fekedulegn et al 2003 gutiérrez jurado and vivoni 2013 sariyildiz et al 2005 the south facing slope receives more intense solar radiation and tend to be drier and warmer than the north facing slope in the northern hemisphere especially far from the equator fekedulegn et al 2003 systematically difference of the vwc and soil temperature will inevitably change the vegetation types in water and energy limited regions sunny slope generally intend to support plants with longer growing seasons and low productivity while shady slope generally supports plants with shorter growing seasons and higher productivity fan et al 2019 this is observed and well explained in our study the vegetation types on the north facing and south facing slope are alpine shrub and alpine meadow with dominant species as salix oritrepha potentilla fruticosa and kobresia pygmaea respectively differences in vegetation types will strongly affect soil structure and pedological properties higher vwc and longer duration of the ft processes indicate better subsurface flow generation conditions in the north facing slope this also explains in one way why the s top is drier than the s bottom but the n top is wetter than the n bottom the thickness of subsurface cz in the north facing slope is systematically thicker than that in the south facing slope for a long time it has been widely considered that mechanical weathering is the main type of weathering in cold regions which is due to ft and thermal stresses hall and thorn 2011 hall et al 2002 however recent research also claimed that moisture availability is the primary limiting factor rather than temperature hall 2013 the diurnal ft cycles are rapid but shallow while the annual ft cycles are deep yet of low frequency goodfellow 2013 the deep cz temperature is often significantly higher than air temperature mechanical weathering is overestimated and chemical or biological weathering may be more prevalent than is usually assumed hall 2013 the north facing slope has higher vwc and deeper root vegetation shrub which leads to stronger chemical weathering and biological process that may thicken the subsurface cz of the north facing slope hall et al 2005 found that there is a distinct aspect influence on the biological weathering processes and the order of weathering degree on the slope aspect is usually south west north east in kunlun mountains of china which is consistent with our results from our results we conclude that generally the cz on north facing slope is thicker than that in the south facing slope which may require further research on the qtp 5 2 subsurface cz structure and pedological properties controls on dominant runoff regime subsurface cz structure and pedological properties both control the runoff generation our results show that the south facing slope is dominated by surface flow however the north facing slope is dominated by subsurface flow this is due to the difference in the subsurface cz structure and pedological properties of the two slopes which are also well illustrated by our observation results at the hillslope scale micro topography can influence microclimates constrain vegetation distributions and then affect subsurface cz structure and pedological properties our results show that the infiltration capacity of the surficial soil is poor in the south facing slope and strong in the north facing slope this may be due to the difference in vegetation types of two slopes on the south facing slope the vegetation type is alpine meadow the sod layer is very hard and contains dense fine grass roots however on the north facing slope the vegetation type is alpine shrub the surficial soil is loose and contains thicker roots this causes precipitation to easily penetrate into the soil on the north facing slope but difficult on the south facing slope the flux capacity of the deep soil is strong in the south facing slope and weak in the north facing slope this is mainly because of the thin soil layer on the south facing slope with coarse textured deep soil however the soil layer on the north facing slope is thick and the deep soil has a very fine texture in the deep soil layer of the south facing slope the water is more likely to be vertically infiltrated while in the deep soil layer of the north facing slope the water easily accumulates on the impending layer to form lateral subsurface flow since similar climatic and tectonics conditions exist at the hillslope scale vegetation type has become one of the keys controlling factors affecting hillslope pedological properties and rainfall runoff processes dearborn et al 2017 elliott and cowell 2018 fan et al 2019 our results indicate that the dominated runoff regime may also have a patterned distribution feature on the slope gradient 5 3 subsurface cz structure and micro topography shaped by runoff processes the subsurface cz structure on the south facing slope is significantly different from that on the north facing slope our results show that on the south facing slope 1 the thickness of the soil layer shows a decreasing trend from top to bottom of the slope 2 the weathered bedrock layer has small pores and contains a large amount of soil particles 3 there is only one 1 inconspicuous impending layer in the subsurface cz however on the north facing slope 1 no obvious trends are observed on the thickness of soil saprolite and the weathered bedrock layer from top to bottom of the slope 2 the weathered bedrock layer has very large pores and contains very few soil particles 3 there are 2 distinct impending layers in the cz profile meanwhile we also found 12 landslides and obvious slope creep and solifluction on the north facing slope runoff and its associated physical chemical and biological processes are one of the important factors in the evolution of the cz structure and topography the difference of the subsurface cz structure and thickness across the south facing slope and north facing slope can be explained as the result of different dominant runoff regimes runoff and its associated physical chemical and biological processes are one of the important factors in the evolution of the cz structure and topography the south facing slope has less runoff and is dominated by surface runoff surface runoff erosion process may lead to the thickness of soil layer gradually decreased from top to bottom of the slope vertical infiltration process in cz may cause the weathered bedrock layer containing much soil and sand particles conversely the north facing slope has more runoff and is dominated by lateral subsurface runoff weak surface runoff processes lead to no obvious trends in soil thickness from top to bottom of the slope the weak vertical infiltration process causes a small amount of soil particles to migrate downward and deposit in the weathered bedrock layer with smaller pores this explains the large pore few soil particles of the weathered bedrock layer and the formation of the second impending layer in subsurface cz strong lateral subsurface flow processes and high vwc cause sediment to migrate primarily in the lateral direction and cause strong landslides slope creep and solifluction processes on the north facing slope however in the shale hills critical zone observatory the north facing slopes mantled with thicker regolith as compared to the south facing slope but the regolith thickness is increasing from top hill to the valley on both north and south facing slopes west et al 2014 which is contrary to our results mainly due to the difference of vegetation type and climate condition the shale hills czo is a forested temperate climate catchment and the mean annual precipitation is 1070 mm guo et al 2019 forest ecosystems prevent runoff erosion and deposit soil grains along the downhill direction leading to a gradual increase in the thickness of regolith from top hill to the valley however in cold and semi arid regions the main vegetation types of the qtp are herbs and shrubs which may lead to weaker runoff processes and soil conservation capacity compared to the shale hills czo our results indicate that under the climate change and grassland permafrost degradation the south facing slope is more inclined to occur grassland degradation and desertification and the north facing slope more inclined to occur landslide and debris flow disasters 5 4 conceptual model illustrating patterns and interplays between subsurface cz structure and dominant runoff regime across micro topography in qtp topography can affect microclimates and constrain vegetation distributions subsurface cz structure and vegetation govern the hydrological processes by pedological properties in turn hydrologic processes and climate influence the topography landscapes by affecting weathering and erosion processes sullivan et al 2017 as an important controlling factor for cz and runoff formation previous studies have found the microclimate and vegetation patterns on the aspect gradient based on the experimental results described above we propose that there are also subsurface cz structure and dominant runoff regime patterns on the aspect gradient fig 13 along topographic gradient as the slope aspect shifted from 0 or 360 south facing to 180 north facing it received weaker solar radiation along the hillslope fig 13a the hillslope temperature gradually decreases and the vwc gradually increases the dominant vegetation types gradually change from longer growing seasons lower productivity plant alpine meadow to shorter growing seasons higher productivity plant alpine shrub as the water availability and root depth gradually increases herb to shrub the thickness of cz gradually also increases as the slope aspect shifts from 0 or 360 south facing sunny to 180 north facing shady meanwhile the dominant runoff regime gradually changes from surface flow to subsurface flow fig 13b sunny slope tends to have hard sod layer and shallow regolith layer causing them to be dominated with surface runoff and a relatively strong vertical infiltration process in cz surface runoff erosion process led to the thickness of soil layer gradually decreasing on the drainage gradient conversely shady slope tends to have loose sod layer and thick soil layer with lower hydraulic conductivity causing the shady slope be dominated with lateral subsurface flow and have minimal surface flow processes strong lateral subsurface flow processes and high vwc lead to active soil loss and landslides on the shady slope because the surface runoff process is too weak the soil layer thickness does not change significantly on the drainage gradient due to lateral confluence the vwc of bottom of the slope is higher than other locations along the slope our observations vividly illustrated the interaction mechanism among subsurface cz structure hydrological processes and topography on hillslope scale the simulation results of alpine landscape in the boulder creek czo show that north facing slopes have better developed damage profile anderson et al 2013 which are consistent with our hypothesis however due to the spatial heterogeneity of the cz structure across the landscape more gpr surveys and hydrological observations are still needed on other slopes to prove this hypothesis on the qtp conducting direct observation experiments of subsurface cz structure and subsurface hydrological processes is challenging in cold regions due to the harsh environment and risk however it is extremely imperative because of its important ecological functions sensitive response and potential remarkable feedbacks on climate change in recent years deep cz structure has been mapped by multiple geophysical methods such as gpr ert and seismic refraction befus et al 2011 brantley et al 2016 diallo et al 2019 st clair et al 2015 thayer et al 2018 however almost none of those studies have directly monitor subsurface flow processes in the entire cz profile soil to bedrock which hinders our further understanding and assessing hydrological processes and the impact of climate change this study is a demonstration of the relations among the subsurface cz structure hydrological processes and micro topography on a headwater sub catchment in the qtp we used gpr to detect the continuous cz structure across full hillslope more importantly we designed a trough collection system fig 2 to monitor subsurface flow processes this system could avoid the influence of the air temperature on the ft activities of subsurface based on this system we could continuously monitor the actual flow process of subsurface cz with at any time of a year due to the relatively thin thickness of the cz of the qtp we can monitor the subsurface flow generation process of the entire cz profile soil to bedrock we hope that our method could promote the associated research in cold regions and benefit more field experiments to directly observe subsurface flow processes in the future 6 conclusions this study comprehensively observed the cz architecture and hydrological processes at the hillslope scale to understand their interplays along topographic gradient on the qtp the main findings are as follows 1 subsurface cz structure ft processes and dominant runoff regime exhibits systematic differences between the north facing and the south facing slope 2 the subsurface cz structure and micro topography cause the hydrological processes on the south facing slope is dominated by surface flow while those on the north facing slope is dominated by subsurface flow 3 in turn the dominant runoff regime leads to a decrease of thickness of the soil layer from the top to the bottom of the south facing slope with severe slope creep and landslides on the north facing slope from the experimental results we proposed that the systematic differences of the subsurface cz structure and dominant runoff regime along the micro topographic gradient at the hillslope scale may become a general pattern in larger scales as illustrated in the conceptual model nevertheless future cz research needs to be conducted across ecosystems on the qtp credit authorship contribution statement guang rong hu carried out the experiment

5751,understanding the transport of nanoparticles nps including nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi particles through water saturated porous media has important implications for many natural and engineered systems for the first time we use spin echo single point imaging se spi of low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr to monitor nanoparticle transport through a heterogeneous porous medium the ability of this method to provide information of nano to micro scale pore structure and to monitor transient processes is verified by a transport experiment using modified nzvi particles early breakthrough of the np front and large amount of residual nps 27 of the iron was retained in the core were observed in the experiment these observations were due to the presence of preferential flow paths and dead end pores as demonstrated by micro x ray computed tomography μct imaging spatial and temporal data provided by this method enabled numerical simulations to quantify the impacts of spatial heterogeneity in pore structure on np transport in terms of transport parameters the simulation that captures the spatial heterogeneity by explicitly considering four regions of distinct porosities outperforms the model assuming a homogeneous pore structure the maximum of residual sum of squares reduced from 0 328 to 0 138 when considering the impact of pore structure the transport parameters vary significantly among different regions for example in the lowest porosity region of this sandstone colloid dispersion d is 0 10 cm2 min instead of 0 20 cm2 min in the most connected region while the attachment kac increased from 0 007 to 0 025 min 1 overall se spi imaging is shown to be an important tool in refining transport processes of nps in heterogeneous porous media with application to constrain complex natural systems keywords nanoparticle transport porous media low field nuclear magnetic resonance heterogeneity 1 introduction nanoparticles nps especially nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi particles have been extensively used for direct treatment of contaminated zones in aquifers because of their desirable properties i e high specific surface area and potential mobility zhang 2003 kanel et al 2006 kocur et al 2013 the remediation efficiency and environmental safety of the application of nps are controlled by their mobility in porous media karn et al 2009 hosseini et al 2011 o carroll et al 2013 bare nzvi particles are subject to rapid aggregation and settling phenrat et al 2007 tiraferri et al 2008 and thus are typically modified by adding polymers anionic surfactants as well as incorporating solid matrices tiraferri and sethi 2009 he et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 fajardo et al 2019 however cell membranes disruption chlorosis or hypoxia have been observed upon exposure to modified nps saif et al 2016 yoon et al 2018 indicating potential adverse health impacts on microbes plants and human therefore it is important to understand and predict the transport and the fate of modified nps in aquifers which are largely influenced by the structure and transport properties of the porous media experimental studies used to investigate the transport properties of nps in porous media typically involve monitoring np concentrations only at the outlet of packed columns the interior processes are then inferred using empirical relations such as colloid filtration theory cft kim et al 2007 vecchia et al 2009 phenrat et al 2009 this type of breakthrough curve analysis although informative provides limited insights regarding the spatial heterogeneity of the column which has a considerable impact on nps transport retardation and attenuation recently a range of non invasive techniques including optical imaging gamma radiation micro x ray computed tomography μct imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr have been used to characterize the spatial distribution of nps in porous media werth et al 2010 and to resolve local transport processes for example optical imaging has been used to track the spatial distribution of fluorescent or color tracers as they flow through a model porous medium zinn et al 2004 willingham et al 2008 but the application is limited to translucent media and typically two dimension systems werth et al 2010 while gamma radiation and μct are powerful tools for the characterization of complex pore structures and for saturation imaging of one or more fluids turner et al 2004 nizovtsev et al 2008 peng et al 2012 the relatively long counting time at a single location limits their application for intrinsically transient phenomena such as fluid flow and particle transport nmr is another promising non invasive imaging technique which quantifies nuclear spin or rotation of elementary particles e g 1h nuclei compared to other imaging techniques the nmr signal is dominated by the liquid phase and does not require phase segmentation in addition nmr allows a wide range of temporal and spatial resolutions nmr techniques especially magnetic resonance imaging mri have been increasingly used in contaminant hydrology to evaluate np transport processes and quantify transport properties of nps in saturated geo materials ramanan et al 2011 bray et al 2017 lehoux et al 2017 for example lakshmanan et al 2015 reconstructed the evolving nps concentrations in the packed columns of quartz and dolomite gravel from mri images and evaluated the transport parameters and interaction energy profiles using the cxtfit software package and derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory most mri studies use high field instruments to acquire relatively high spatial resolution on the order of mm to 100 μm werth et al 2010 but it is still inadequate for fine grained media pore diameter 600 μm lakshmanan et al 2015 bray et al 2017 in addition high field imaging has the issue of pore scale magnetic field distortions so called internal gradients when the materials are heterogeneous as a result of such distortions the decay of transverse magnetization with respect to molecular diffusion is enhanced and concentrations are typically under estimated as such the use of high field imaging in the investigations of nps transport in geo materials is limited mitchell and fordham 2015 low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr spectrometers provides a better alternative for laboratory investigations of np transport in porous media that are comparable to natural aquifers mitchell et al 2010 lf nmr is less affected by internal gradients enabling quantitative analysis in addition the spin echo single point imaging se spi method of low field nmr has the ability to monitor transient processes in heterogeneous porous media first the se spi sequence allows the imaging of np transport through consolidated porous materials with nano scale pores it obtains transverse relaxation time t2 distribution profiles with phase encoded mri every t2 curve contains encoded information of pore structure spanning nano to micro scale for the specific profile second the rapid loss of the transverse time resulting from the presence of paramagnetic nps can be detected by the se spi sequence on a time scale of seconds and thus enables dynamic monitoring of transient processes petrov et al 2011 moreover using multi profile concentration data converted from nmr data the se spi sequence provides non invasive observations of np transport processes at different locations we explore the use of low field nmr to monitor transport behaviors of nps in consolidated porous media and demonstrate how this contributes to an improved understanding of the impacts of spatial heterogeneity on mass transport this is among the first efforts to apply se spi low field nmr imaging in investigating transport processes of nps typically used in environmental remediation we use modified nzvi jia et al 2011 as a candidate particle in spatially heterogeneous porous media commonly encountered in natural aquifers spatial histories of concentration are recovered from the nmr measurements complementary simulations informed by these experimental observations highlight the impact of spatial heterogeneity on transport processes with μct imaging corroborating the inverted pore structure the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the materials experimental methods and the governing equations used in the simulations the results of the calibration tests and transport experiments are described in section 3 in section 4 we discuss the impacts of spatial heterogeneity on nps transport as observed in experiments based on complementary simulations we close with a few concluding remarks 2 materials and methods 2 1 nanoparticles the modified nzvi particles used in the experiments consist of smectite clay templates and subnano sized zero valent in the interlayers and the iron content is 4 by weight gu et al 2010 the size of the elementary platelets of the smectites range from tens to hundreds of nanometers with an average of 60 nm and determines the diameters of the colloids in the suspensions the suspensions were prepared by mixing the modified nps with deionized water and centrifuged to ensure homogeneity the nps are stable in the suspensions because the structure of the clay templates prevents direct contact between fe0 clusters and thus agglomeration of the nzvi particles jia and wang 2013 this is confirmed by the batch tests in which the suspensions were left in experimental vials and remained homogeneous for up to two days much longer than the time scale of the flow through experiment as such the experimentally observed np transport can be attributed to the transport properties of the porous media instead of potential aggregation and deposition associated with particle surface properties twelve suspensions were prepared for the concentration calibration tests the iron concentrations of the prepared suspensions range from 0 0005 to 0 1430 mm and were confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms measurements 2 2 porous media six homogeneous packed columns were prepared for the calibration tests the quartz sands used were first soaked in concentrated hcl 12 mol l for 12 h and rinsed in deionized water each column is 25 mm in diameter and 25 mm long and is packed with quartz sands following the face centered cubic fcc packing procedure the six quartz sand columns have grain sizes s1 to s6 of 105 125 149 165 250 and 425 µm respectively the corresponding pore sizes are 16 275 19 375 23 095 25 575 38 750 and 65 875 µm according to the empirical relation between the pore size dp and the grain size dg for the fcc array dp 0 155 dg an artificial sandstone core with a diameter of 24 95 mm and a length of 50 15 mm was used in the transport experiment chemically modified epoxy resin with triethanolamine tea was used to bind together quartz sands with sizes from 125 to 149 µm to create the hydrophilic artificial sandstone core xie et al 2016 the core has a gas permeability of 100 md representing the lower range of typical aquifer permeabilities more details of the core properties including imaging by μct and characteristics of the pore structure are discussed in section 4 prior to the experiment the core was dried at 105 c for 24 h with a vacuum applied to 0 1 pa absolute for 3 h before saturating with water at 5 mpa for 12 h 2 3 test procedures and experimental apparatus two sets of calibration tests were performed to establish the method of quantifying iron concentration profiles from nmr data the first set of tests was performed on twelve suspensions of different iron concentrations to build the relationship between iron concentrations and nmr signals then packed columns of different grain sizes saturated with suspensions were tested to examine the impacts of pore structure on t2 relaxation times for the transport experiment the sandstone core was placed horizontally into a core displacement system with a nonmagnetic core holder fig 1 and was first flushed with deionized water to remove the air and establish steady state flow t2 data were collected before the transport experiment serving as a reference fluid flow was then established at a constant flow rate of 0 1 ml min for the first 55 mins of the transport experiment the inflow was a suspension of nps at a concentration of 0 1 g l corresponding to an iron concentration of 0 07 mm in the suspension the inflow was subsequently switched to deionized water with the entire experiment lasting 120 mins with nmr measurements collected every 5 mins nmr measurements were performed on a niumag system which includes a 0 5 t superconducting magnet with a resonant frequency of 21 mhz and a 60 mm probe the experiments were performed with the following parameters an echo time te of 0 025 ms a repetition time tr of 3000 ms and 16 scans ns in the calibration tests t2 relaxation times were obtained using the se spi sequence with one slice enclosing the entire sample in the np transport test se spi sequence data were collected at 15 locations evenly distributed along the core from inlet to outlet ct images of the sandstone core were collected to characterize the pore structure using a zeiss xradia scanner 520 versa at 80 kv and 87 μa the resulting image resolution is approximately 26 26 26 µm3 the three dimensional pore structure of the sandstone was analyzed using avizo visualization software 2 4 quantitative measurement of np concentrations the local magnetic field fluctuations of the paramagnetic nps result in rapid loss of the transverse magnetization and thus shorter t2 times relative to those for pure water pykett et al 1982 the shortening of relaxation rates per unit concentration of nps is defined as the relaxivity r caravan et al 1999 and has a unit of mm 1s 1 the relaxivity is generally dependent on the strength of the magnetic field the concentration of paramagnetic nps c is related to the transverse relaxation time of pure water as follows bloembergen and morgan 1961 strijkers et al 2007 1 c 1 r 1 t 2 i 1 t 2 0 where t2 0 is the relaxation time in the absence of paramagnetic nps and t2 i is the relaxation time in the presence of a concentration c of paramagnetic nps the influence of the porous medium on t2 may be examined in terms of the transverse relaxation rate 1 t2 that comprises the bulk surface and enhanced diffusion relaxation rates behroozmand et al 2014 2 1 t 2 1 t 2 b ρ 0 s v d m g t e γ 2 12 where t2b is the bulk relaxation time ρ0 is the transverse surface relaxation strength s is the pore surface area v is the pore volume dm is the molecular diffusion coefficient g is the magnetic field gradient te is the echo spacing and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio given that the bulk relaxation is slower than the surface relaxation then the small magnetic field gradient eq 2 can be simplified as follows 3 1 t 2 ρ 0 s v eq 3 was verified by calibration tests on packed quartz sand columns of different grain sizes in addition the effect of the paramagnetic np concentration on t2 in two different pore structures was also evaluated prior to the transport experiment using eqs 1 and 2 2 5 estimation of transport parameters the transport parameters were evaluated using the hydrus 1d software package which accommodates key processes associated with colloid transport in variably saturated porous media šimůnek et al 2006 the transport and fate of colloids is accommodated by the advection dispersion equation that is modified to account for colloid filtration in the absence of colloid inactivation and degradation processes not anticipated in our experiment the colloid transport equation is given as 4 θ c c t ρ s c t x θ d c c x q c c x where cc is the colloid concentration in the aqueous phase nl 3 sc is the solid phase colloid concentration nm 1 θ is the volumetric water content l3l 3 d is the dispersion coefficient for colloids l2t 1 and q is the volumetric water flux density lt 1 t is the time and x is the distance to the injection point the colloid mass transfer term between the aqueous and solid phases is traditionally given as 5 ρ s c t θ k ac ψ s c c ρ k dc s c where kac and kdc are first order colloid attachment and detachment coefficients t 1 respectively and ψs is a dimensionless colloid retention function in this study d kac and kdc are the key parameters representing transport and were evaluated by inverse solution using hydrus 1d with porosity and permeability treated as the known parameters the nps were delivered as a pulse input from the inlet the corresponding initial and boundary conditions are 6 c x t 0 0 c x 0 0 t t i c 0 c x 0 t t 1 0 dc dx x l 0 where t 1 is the pulse input time and l is the length of the sandstone 3 results 3 1 calibration for relaxivity constant the first set of calibration tests obtained the relaxivity constant of modified nzvi particles mentioned in eq 1 to establish the quantitative measurement of np concentrations fig 2 shows that the transverse relaxation rate 1 t2 i 1 t2 0 follows a linear relationship with respect to the concentration of the nps where t2 was measured three times for each np suspension the percentage errors for the individual t2 measurements are between 0 17 and 0 46 corresponding to percentage errors of 0 22 to 2 11 for 1 t2 i 1 t2 0 the small measurement errors not visible on the figure and high repeatability confirmed the stability and reliability of the method the relaxivity constant r of the modified nzvi particles determined using the least squares fit method is 86 63 mm 1s 1 with goodness of fit coefficient r2 larger than 0 99 3 2 effects on nmr signals in porous media to quantify the impacts of the pore structure on t2 relaxation t2 tests were also performed on six columns packed with quartz sands of different sizes s1 to s6 using np suspensions of the same iron concentration of 0 05 mm the results fig 3 a show that 1 t 2 increases linearly with s v where the s and v were calculated using pore sizes the high goodness of fit also verifies that eq 3 provides a reasonable mathematical description of the impacts of pore structure on t2 relaxation although pore structure largely affects the magnitudes of the t2 relaxation their impacts on transverse relaxation rate is minimal the relationships between the transverse relaxation rate and the iron concentration measured in two packed columns s2 and s4 are similar fig 3b the fitted values of r based on eq 1 are 87 61 mm 1s 1 and 86 44 mm 1s 1 respectively and are comparable to the values derived from the calibration tests that were performed without porous media fig 2 collectively the observations confirm that the impacts of concentration and pore structure on t2 relaxation are independent of each other and can be accounted for by the relaxivity r and the ratio of pore surface to volume ratio s v respectively since s v is included in the calculation of t2 0 the relationship between the transverse relaxation rate is only dependent on concentration this relationship allows the deciphering of the paramagnetic np transport processes using t2 measurements in heterogeneous porous media 3 3 nmr measurements of np transport in sandstone transport of the modified nzvi particles through the sandstone core was also monitored using the se spi sequences the relaxivity constant r for the modified nzvi particles in the sandstone core was derived following the same procedure described above a value of 86 41 mm 1s 1 was obtained and used to convert nmr measurements into concentration data in the transport experiments using the same sandstone core the t2 data were collected along the core at an interval of 3 33 mm every five minutes the transverse relaxation rate is directly related to iron concentration see section 3 1 and is recorded along the core sample at successive time intervals as shown in fig 4 this defines the variation of relative concentrations c c0 c is the measured concentration of iron and c0 is the influent iron concentration along the sandstone resulting from the transport of the modified nzvi particles during the injection of nps 0 55 min the values of 1 t2 i 1 t2 0 gradually increase along the core as the concentration front advances from the inlet to the outlet the front where the nps were first detected migrates much faster than the bulk transport of the nps e g at 15 and 20 mins potentially indicating the presence of preferential flow paths at the conclusion of the injection 55 min a large portion of the sandstone was saturated by the np suspension as indicated by the uniform distribution of large 1 t2 i 1 t2 0 magnitudes although nps were detected at the outlet at 40 mins the bulk of the nps did not break through the core by the end of the injection as confirmed by the relatively low 1 t2 i 1 t2 0 values occupying the final 15 mm of the core length this may be attributed to both the attachment of nps to the sandstone grains and the innate complexity of the pore structure during the injection of deionized water 55 120 min 1 t2 i 1 t2 0 magnitudes first decrease close to the inlet and increase close to the outlet as the prior concentration distribution is displaced along the core effectively flushing out of the nps however at the conclusion of the injection of the di water the 1 t2 i 1 t2 0 values do not return to zero indicating the presence of residual nps in the aqueous phase or attached to grains the residual nps may represent trapping in poorly connected pores or mechanical electrostatic trapping on grain boundaries and their continuous detachment of nps from the sandstone supplementary characterization methods are necessary to fully deconvolve other mechanisms for the trapping of residual nps fig 5 provides a visualization of the pore structures reconstructed from the μct images with the pore space color coded by the relative concentration c c0 the peak value of iron concentration measured by the c c0 ratio decreased from 0 98 to 0 87 which indicates an increase in np retention over time the iron recovery which measures the ratio between the amount of iron collected at the outlet and the amount of iron injected into the core was calculated from the icp measurements of the effluent samples and is 73 identifying net retention of nps in the sandstone core there was however no observable clogging phenomenon since there was no detectable change in the pressure drop between the inlet and outlet this is also consistent with the observation that the modified nzvi particles are unlikely to aggregate jia and wang 2013 4 discussion in this section we discuss the impacts of pore structure heterogeneity as confirmed by the μct images on the transport of nps by comparing transport parameters obtained using two sets of simulations with different assumptions of the pore structure the spatial heterogeneity of the three dimensional structure of the sandstone was confirmed by μct imaging pores within the sandstone were distributed with an average diameter of 35 μm binarization of the μct images recovers an average porosity of 0 203 which is close to the ratio of the volumes of the aqueous phase to the core however the connected porosity varies spatially along the core with four distinct regions observed fig 6 region ⅰ has the highest connected porosity and region iii from slice 6 to slice 13 the lowest spatial heterogeneity of the pore structure i e the presence of well connected flow paths and poorly connected pores or dead end pores as inferred from the experimental concentration data is further highlighted in fig 7 connectivity analysis and skeletonization were performed using avizo to define the 3d digital structure of the sandstone the skeletonization module extracts the centerlines of interconnected pore regions and calculates a distance map that measures the distance of a voxel in the pore space to the nearest solid phase from the segmented images the 3d skeleton consists of nodes and tubes and defines the topology the nodes are the branching points and endpoints connected by the tubes whose thickness depends on the maximum value on the distance map dead end pores are highlighted orange dotted circles in fig 7b with the prescribed network allowing flow calculations on a subsection of the sample avizo xlab hydro module streamlines see fig 7c show the relative velocity field with red defining the higher velocity preferential flow paths that likely act as fast channels for np transport hydrus 1d was used to simulate flow using the experimental observations of concentration history to invert for the transport parameters dispersion coefficient d attachment coefficient kac and detachment coefficient kdc porosity and permeability were prescribed based on the experimental observations the advection dispersion equation was coupled with the first order attachment detachment kinetics and solved using the internal hydrus 1d optimization routine aggregation and clogging were not considered based on the experimental observations discussed above straining of the nps was also considered to be negligible and not included in the model because the ratio of the particle diameter to the median pore diameter was less than the threshold for straining 0 005 bradford et al 2004 modeling was first performed assuming a homogeneous pore structure with an average connected porosity of 0 203 flow parameters were evaluated by fitting the concentration data of slice 15 the outlet between 0 and 120 min similar to a standard breakthrough curve btc analysis commonly adopted when spatial data are not available fig 8 presents the experimental data and the fitted concentration results overall using values of 0 16 mm2 min 0 018 min 1 and 0 07 min 1 for d kac and kdc respectively the simulation fits the experimental data with a goodness of fit value r2 of 96 9 table 1 to evaluate the extent to which the transport parameters derived following the standard btc analysis can be applied to evaluate concentration evolution within the core simulations were performed using the btcs of four slices slice 2 5 10 14 these locations correspond to the centers of the four distinct porosity regions identified as fig 6 for these simulations each region was assigned a unique set of hydraulic properties the permeability was estimated from the average connected porosity of the region based on the kozeny carman relationship the transport parameters of the upstream region were first evaluated and used for the fitting of the transport parameters of the downstream region fig 9 shows the simulation results for the four regions while the goodness of fit values r2 ranging from 90 5 to 96 1 table 1 are not as high as for the homogeneous model the improved performance is highlighted by the low overall residual sum of squares which are 0 114 0 138 0 074 and 0 041 for different slices in contrast using the transport parameters derived from the standard btc analysis and assuming a homogeneous pore structure for the simulation of the local btcs the residual sum of squares is 0 276 0 290 0 328 and 0 044 the improved performance due to the consideration of spatial heterogeneity is most evident for region iii transport parameters kac and kdc recovered from simulations indicate the considerable impact of mechanical electrostatic trapping and subsequent detachment of nps on transport processes with respect to residual nps comparing the performance of the two simulations further highlights the need of considering spatial heterogeneity nevertheless some discrepancies between the experimental data and the simulations are observed principally in the tail of the concentration distribution in spite of identifying the attachment detachment effects this may result from the presence of dead end pores with this confirmed by the connectivity analysis completed using the avizo visualization software this effect cannot be accounted for in a purely 1d model the fitted parameters in different regions vary considerably indicating the importance of spatial heterogeneity in controlling np transport in general d and kdc are smaller in the lower porosity region whereas kac is larger table 1 collectively they result in reduced spreading and increased retention of the nps a higher attachment rate was observed in the lower permeability porous medium due to the effect of hydraulic conductivity and surface area he et al 2009 these simulations demonstrate that although the standard btc analysis with the assumption of homogeneity provides a reasonably good fitting for the overall transport process it fails to capture concentration evolution within the core this is the case even though the degree of heterogeneity in the synthetic core sample used in our experiment is limited thus the impacts of increased local heterogeneity are expected to be even more significant in natural heterogeneous systems and to be important when regions of certain hydraulic properties need to be targeted the spatial temporal data measured using the se spi sequences provide necessary information to investigate spatial heterogeneity and to quantify advection dispersion and attachment detachment mechanisms and their controls on the fate of colloidal particles in structured heterogeneous porous media overall the se spi sequences of low field nmr provide an effective method to monitor the transport process of nanoparticles in rocks given its high resolution this method may also be applied to low permeability geomaterials e g carbonates and shales however some limitations of the technique should be noted first the relaxivity of paramagnetic nps is the key parameter to quantify concentrations from nmr data the calibration of relaxivity may be affected by the presence of paramagnetic substances with local magnetic field fluctuations which may be the case in granites second the nmr data provided by this method are the spectra representing multiple slices of defined thickness the spatial resolution of data therefore depends on the number of slices set for the se spi sequences but signal to noise ratio decreases as the number of subdivided slices increases 5 conclusions for the first time this study used se spi sequences based on low field nmr to successfully monitor the transport of modified nzvi particles in a consolidated sandstone the ability of se spi to simultaneously monitor multiple profiles along the core allows non invasive observation of the transport of paramagnetic nps iron concentrations were recovered through the relaxivity constant from the direct inversion of the spatio temporal data this study contributes an improved understanding of np mobility in porous media to illuminate the important impacts of spatial heterogeneity on transport processes via cross confirmation using simulations and μct imaging experimental observations including i the more rapid migration of the front first detected at 15 mins relative to bulk transport of the injected solution of nps and ii the retention of nps with 27 of the iron retained at the conclusion of deionized water flushing highlight the important controls of complex pore structure on the resulting retardation attenuation and efflux of nps complementary numerical simulations evaluate sample heterogeneity and its effects on local transport properties transport parameters are inverted from the concentration data using two set of simulations and are compared to consider the impacts of spatial heterogeneity in general the model considering four regions of distinct porosities shows improved performance as highlighted by the low overall residual sum of squares 0 041 to 0 138 compared to another model assuming a homogeneous pore structure 0 044 to 0 328 in addition results show that the spatial heterogeneity of the transport and retention properties correlate with the pore structure extracted from μct imaging compared to the most connected region colloid dispersion d reduced from 0 20 to 0 10 cm2 min while the attachment kac increased from 0 007 to 0 025 min 1 in the lowest porosity region the presence of well connected flow paths and poorly connected or dead end pores in the sandstone results in tailing of the breakthrough curve and leads to discrepancies between experimental observations and results from equivalent medium simulations in conclusion se spi sequences using low field nmr is a promising approach for characterization of the transport retardation and attenuation of nps in heterogeneous porous media even in the presence of nano scale pores in particular and distinct from other nmr imaging methods se spi enables characterization at high resolution 2d or 3d models may be adopted in the future to consider the true impact of spatial dimension on np transport credit authorship

5751,understanding the transport of nanoparticles nps including nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi particles through water saturated porous media has important implications for many natural and engineered systems for the first time we use spin echo single point imaging se spi of low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr to monitor nanoparticle transport through a heterogeneous porous medium the ability of this method to provide information of nano to micro scale pore structure and to monitor transient processes is verified by a transport experiment using modified nzvi particles early breakthrough of the np front and large amount of residual nps 27 of the iron was retained in the core were observed in the experiment these observations were due to the presence of preferential flow paths and dead end pores as demonstrated by micro x ray computed tomography μct imaging spatial and temporal data provided by this method enabled numerical simulations to quantify the impacts of spatial heterogeneity in pore structure on np transport in terms of transport parameters the simulation that captures the spatial heterogeneity by explicitly considering four regions of distinct porosities outperforms the model assuming a homogeneous pore structure the maximum of residual sum of squares reduced from 0 328 to 0 138 when considering the impact of pore structure the transport parameters vary significantly among different regions for example in the lowest porosity region of this sandstone colloid dispersion d is 0 10 cm2 min instead of 0 20 cm2 min in the most connected region while the attachment kac increased from 0 007 to 0 025 min 1 overall se spi imaging is shown to be an important tool in refining transport processes of nps in heterogeneous porous media with application to constrain complex natural systems keywords nanoparticle transport porous media low field nuclear magnetic resonance heterogeneity 1 introduction nanoparticles nps especially nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi particles have been extensively used for direct treatment of contaminated zones in aquifers because of their desirable properties i e high specific surface area and potential mobility zhang 2003 kanel et al 2006 kocur et al 2013 the remediation efficiency and environmental safety of the application of nps are controlled by their mobility in porous media karn et al 2009 hosseini et al 2011 o carroll et al 2013 bare nzvi particles are subject to rapid aggregation and settling phenrat et al 2007 tiraferri et al 2008 and thus are typically modified by adding polymers anionic surfactants as well as incorporating solid matrices tiraferri and sethi 2009 he et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 fajardo et al 2019 however cell membranes disruption chlorosis or hypoxia have been observed upon exposure to modified nps saif et al 2016 yoon et al 2018 indicating potential adverse health impacts on microbes plants and human therefore it is important to understand and predict the transport and the fate of modified nps in aquifers which are largely influenced by the structure and transport properties of the porous media experimental studies used to investigate the transport properties of nps in porous media typically involve monitoring np concentrations only at the outlet of packed columns the interior processes are then inferred using empirical relations such as colloid filtration theory cft kim et al 2007 vecchia et al 2009 phenrat et al 2009 this type of breakthrough curve analysis although informative provides limited insights regarding the spatial heterogeneity of the column which has a considerable impact on nps transport retardation and attenuation recently a range of non invasive techniques including optical imaging gamma radiation micro x ray computed tomography μct imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr have been used to characterize the spatial distribution of nps in porous media werth et al 2010 and to resolve local transport processes for example optical imaging has been used to track the spatial distribution of fluorescent or color tracers as they flow through a model porous medium zinn et al 2004 willingham et al 2008 but the application is limited to translucent media and typically two dimension systems werth et al 2010 while gamma radiation and μct are powerful tools for the characterization of complex pore structures and for saturation imaging of one or more fluids turner et al 2004 nizovtsev et al 2008 peng et al 2012 the relatively long counting time at a single location limits their application for intrinsically transient phenomena such as fluid flow and particle transport nmr is another promising non invasive imaging technique which quantifies nuclear spin or rotation of elementary particles e g 1h nuclei compared to other imaging techniques the nmr signal is dominated by the liquid phase and does not require phase segmentation in addition nmr allows a wide range of temporal and spatial resolutions nmr techniques especially magnetic resonance imaging mri have been increasingly used in contaminant hydrology to evaluate np transport processes and quantify transport properties of nps in saturated geo materials ramanan et al 2011 bray et al 2017 lehoux et al 2017 for example lakshmanan et al 2015 reconstructed the evolving nps concentrations in the packed columns of quartz and dolomite gravel from mri images and evaluated the transport parameters and interaction energy profiles using the cxtfit software package and derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory most mri studies use high field instruments to acquire relatively high spatial resolution on the order of mm to 100 μm werth et al 2010 but it is still inadequate for fine grained media pore diameter 600 μm lakshmanan et al 2015 bray et al 2017 in addition high field imaging has the issue of pore scale magnetic field distortions so called internal gradients when the materials are heterogeneous as a result of such distortions the decay of transverse magnetization with respect to molecular diffusion is enhanced and concentrations are typically under estimated as such the use of high field imaging in the investigations of nps transport in geo materials is limited mitchell and fordham 2015 low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr spectrometers provides a better alternative for laboratory investigations of np transport in porous media that are comparable to natural aquifers mitchell et al 2010 lf nmr is less affected by internal gradients enabling quantitative analysis in addition the spin echo single point imaging se spi method of low field nmr has the ability to monitor transient processes in heterogeneous porous media first the se spi sequence allows the imaging of np transport through consolidated porous materials with nano scale pores it obtains transverse relaxation time t2 distribution profiles with phase encoded mri every t2 curve contains encoded information of pore structure spanning nano to micro scale for the specific profile second the rapid loss of the transverse time resulting from the presence of paramagnetic nps can be detected by the se spi sequence on a time scale of seconds and thus enables dynamic monitoring of transient processes petrov et al 2011 moreover using multi profile concentration data converted from nmr data the se spi sequence provides non invasive observations of np transport processes at different locations we explore the use of low field nmr to monitor transport behaviors of nps in consolidated porous media and demonstrate how this contributes to an improved understanding of the impacts of spatial heterogeneity on mass transport this is among the first efforts to apply se spi low field nmr imaging in investigating transport processes of nps typically used in environmental remediation we use modified nzvi jia et al 2011 as a candidate particle in spatially heterogeneous porous media commonly encountered in natural aquifers spatial histories of concentration are recovered from the nmr measurements complementary simulations informed by these experimental observations highlight the impact of spatial heterogeneity on transport processes with μct imaging corroborating the inverted pore structure the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the materials experimental methods and the governing equations used in the simulations the results of the calibration tests and transport experiments are described in section 3 in section 4 we discuss the impacts of spatial heterogeneity on nps transport as observed in experiments based on complementary simulations we close with a few concluding remarks 2 materials and methods 2 1 nanoparticles the modified nzvi particles used in the experiments consist of smectite clay templates and subnano sized zero valent in the interlayers and the iron content is 4 by weight gu et al 2010 the size of the elementary platelets of the smectites range from tens to hundreds of nanometers with an average of 60 nm and determines the diameters of the colloids in the suspensions the suspensions were prepared by mixing the modified nps with deionized water and centrifuged to ensure homogeneity the nps are stable in the suspensions because the structure of the clay templates prevents direct contact between fe0 clusters and thus agglomeration of the nzvi particles jia and wang 2013 this is confirmed by the batch tests in which the suspensions were left in experimental vials and remained homogeneous for up to two days much longer than the time scale of the flow through experiment as such the experimentally observed np transport can be attributed to the transport properties of the porous media instead of potential aggregation and deposition associated with particle surface properties twelve suspensions were prepared for the concentration calibration tests the iron concentrations of the prepared suspensions range from 0 0005 to 0 1430 mm and were confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms measurements 2 2 porous media six homogeneous packed columns were prepared for the calibration tests the quartz sands used were first soaked in concentrated hcl 12 mol l for 12 h and rinsed in deionized water each column is 25 mm in diameter and 25 mm long and is packed with quartz sands following the face centered cubic fcc packing procedure the six quartz sand columns have grain sizes s1 to s6 of 105 125 149 165 250 and 425 µm respectively the corresponding pore sizes are 16 275 19 375 23 095 25 575 38 750 and 65 875 µm according to the empirical relation between the pore size dp and the grain size dg for the fcc array dp 0 155 dg an artificial sandstone core with a diameter of 24 95 mm and a length of 50 15 mm was used in the transport experiment chemically modified epoxy resin with triethanolamine tea was used to bind together quartz sands with sizes from 125 to 149 µm to create the hydrophilic artificial sandstone core xie et al 2016 the core has a gas permeability of 100 md representing the lower range of typical aquifer permeabilities more details of the core properties including imaging by μct and characteristics of the pore structure are discussed in section 4 prior to the experiment the core was dried at 105 c for 24 h with a vacuum applied to 0 1 pa absolute for 3 h before saturating with water at 5 mpa for 12 h 2 3 test procedures and experimental apparatus two sets of calibration tests were performed to establish the method of quantifying iron concentration profiles from nmr data the first set of tests was performed on twelve suspensions of different iron concentrations to build the relationship between iron concentrations and nmr signals then packed columns of different grain sizes saturated with suspensions were tested to examine the impacts of pore structure on t2 relaxation times for the transport experiment the sandstone core was placed horizontally into a core displacement system with a nonmagnetic core holder fig 1 and was first flushed with deionized water to remove the air and establish steady state flow t2 data were collected before the transport experiment serving as a reference fluid flow was then established at a constant flow rate of 0 1 ml min for the first 55 mins of the transport experiment the inflow was a suspension of nps at a concentration of 0 1 g l corresponding to an iron concentration of 0 07 mm in the suspension the inflow was subsequently switched to deionized water with the entire experiment lasting 120 mins with nmr measurements collected every 5 mins nmr measurements were performed on a niumag system which includes a 0 5 t superconducting magnet with a resonant frequency of 21 mhz and a 60 mm probe the experiments were performed with the following parameters an echo time te of 0 025 ms a repetition time tr of 3000 ms and 16 scans ns in the calibration tests t2 relaxation times were obtained using the se spi sequence with one slice enclosing the entire sample in the np transport test se spi sequence data were collected at 15 locations evenly distributed along the core from inlet to outlet ct images of the sandstone core were collected to characterize the pore structure using a zeiss xradia scanner 520 versa at 80 kv and 87 μa the resulting image resolution is approximately 26 26 26 µm3 the three dimensional pore structure of the sandstone was analyzed using avizo visualization software 2 4 quantitative measurement of np concentrations the local magnetic field fluctuations of the paramagnetic nps result in rapid loss of the transverse magnetization and thus shorter t2 times relative to those for pure water pykett et al 1982 the shortening of relaxation rates per unit concentration of nps is defined as the relaxivity r caravan et al 1999 and has a unit of mm 1s 1 the relaxivity is generally dependent on the strength of the magnetic field the concentration of paramagnetic nps c is related to the transverse relaxation time of pure water as follows bloembergen and morgan 1961 strijkers et al 2007 1 c 1 r 1 t 2 i 1 t 2 0 where t2 0 is the relaxation time in the absence of paramagnetic nps and t2 i is the relaxation time in the presence of a concentration c of paramagnetic nps the influence of the porous medium on t2 may be examined in terms of the transverse relaxation rate 1 t2 that comprises the bulk surface and enhanced diffusion relaxation rates behroozmand et al 2014 2 1 t 2 1 t 2 b ρ 0 s v d m g t e γ 2 12 where t2b is the bulk relaxation time ρ0 is the transverse surface relaxation strength s is the pore surface area v is the pore volume dm is the molecular diffusion coefficient g is the magnetic field gradient te is the echo spacing and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio given that the bulk relaxation is slower than the surface relaxation then the small magnetic field gradient eq 2 can be simplified as follows 3 1 t 2 ρ 0 s v eq 3 was verified by calibration tests on packed quartz sand columns of different grain sizes in addition the effect of the paramagnetic np concentration on t2 in two different pore structures was also evaluated prior to the transport experiment using eqs 1 and 2 2 5 estimation of transport parameters the transport parameters were evaluated using the hydrus 1d software package which accommodates key processes associated with colloid transport in variably saturated porous media šimůnek et al 2006 the transport and fate of colloids is accommodated by the advection dispersion equation that is modified to account for colloid filtration in the absence of colloid inactivation and degradation processes not anticipated in our experiment the colloid transport equation is given as 4 θ c c t ρ s c t x θ d c c x q c c x where cc is the colloid concentration in the aqueous phase nl 3 sc is the solid phase colloid concentration nm 1 θ is the volumetric water content l3l 3 d is the dispersion coefficient for colloids l2t 1 and q is the volumetric water flux density lt 1 t is the time and x is the distance to the injection point the colloid mass transfer term between the aqueous and solid phases is traditionally given as 5 ρ s c t θ k ac ψ s c c ρ k dc s c where kac and kdc are first order colloid attachment and detachment coefficients t 1 respectively and ψs is a dimensionless colloid retention function in this study d kac and kdc are the key parameters representing transport and were evaluated by inverse solution using hydrus 1d with porosity and permeability treated as the known parameters the nps were delivered as a pulse input from the inlet the corresponding initial and boundary conditions are 6 c x t 0 0 c x 0 0 t t i c 0 c x 0 t t 1 0 dc dx x l 0 where t 1 is the pulse input time and l is the length of the sandstone 3 results 3 1 calibration for relaxivity constant the first set of calibration tests obtained the relaxivity constant of modified nzvi particles mentioned in eq 1 to establish the quantitative measurement of np concentrations fig 2 shows that the transverse relaxation rate 1 t2 i 1 t2 0 follows a linear relationship with respect to the concentration of the nps where t2 was measured three times for each np suspension the percentage errors for the individual t2 measurements are between 0 17 and 0 46 corresponding to percentage errors of 0 22 to 2 11 for 1 t2 i 1 t2 0 the small measurement errors not visible on the figure and high repeatability confirmed the stability and reliability of the method the relaxivity constant r of the modified nzvi particles determined using the least squares fit method is 86 63 mm 1s 1 with goodness of fit coefficient r2 larger than 0 99 3 2 effects on nmr signals in porous media to quantify the impacts of the pore structure on t2 relaxation t2 tests were also performed on six columns packed with quartz sands of different sizes s1 to s6 using np suspensions of the same iron concentration of 0 05 mm the results fig 3 a show that 1 t 2 increases linearly with s v where the s and v were calculated using pore sizes the high goodness of fit also verifies that eq 3 provides a reasonable mathematical description of the impacts of pore structure on t2 relaxation although pore structure largely affects the magnitudes of the t2 relaxation their impacts on transverse relaxation rate is minimal the relationships between the transverse relaxation rate and the iron concentration measured in two packed columns s2 and s4 are similar fig 3b the fitted values of r based on eq 1 are 87 61 mm 1s 1 and 86 44 mm 1s 1 respectively and are comparable to the values derived from the calibration tests that were performed without porous media fig 2 collectively the observations confirm that the impacts of concentration and pore structure on t2 relaxation are independent of each other and can be accounted for by the relaxivity r and the ratio of pore surface to volume ratio s v respectively since s v is included in the calculation of t2 0 the relationship between the transverse relaxation rate is only dependent on concentration this relationship allows the deciphering of the paramagnetic np transport processes using t2 measurements in heterogeneous porous media 3 3 nmr measurements of np transport in sandstone transport of the modified nzvi particles through the sandstone core was also monitored using the se spi sequences the relaxivity constant r for the modified nzvi particles in the sandstone core was derived following the same procedure described above a value of 86 41 mm 1s 1 was obtained and used to convert nmr measurements into concentration data in the transport experiments using the same sandstone core the t2 data were collected along the core at an interval of 3 33 mm every five minutes the transverse relaxation rate is directly related to iron concentration see section 3 1 and is recorded along the core sample at successive time intervals as shown in fig 4 this defines the variation of relative concentrations c c0 c is the measured concentration of iron and c0 is the influent iron concentration along the sandstone resulting from the transport of the modified nzvi particles during the injection of nps 0 55 min the values of 1 t2 i 1 t2 0 gradually increase along the core as the concentration front advances from the inlet to the outlet the front where the nps were first detected migrates much faster than the bulk transport of the nps e g at 15 and 20 mins potentially indicating the presence of preferential flow paths at the conclusion of the injection 55 min a large portion of the sandstone was saturated by the np suspension as indicated by the uniform distribution of large 1 t2 i 1 t2 0 magnitudes although nps were detected at the outlet at 40 mins the bulk of the nps did not break through the core by the end of the injection as confirmed by the relatively low 1 t2 i 1 t2 0 values occupying the final 15 mm of the core length this may be attributed to both the attachment of nps to the sandstone grains and the innate complexity of the pore structure during the injection of deionized water 55 120 min 1 t2 i 1 t2 0 magnitudes first decrease close to the inlet and increase close to the outlet as the prior concentration distribution is displaced along the core effectively flushing out of the nps however at the conclusion of the injection of the di water the 1 t2 i 1 t2 0 values do not return to zero indicating the presence of residual nps in the aqueous phase or attached to grains the residual nps may represent trapping in poorly connected pores or mechanical electrostatic trapping on grain boundaries and their continuous detachment of nps from the sandstone supplementary characterization methods are necessary to fully deconvolve other mechanisms for the trapping of residual nps fig 5 provides a visualization of the pore structures reconstructed from the μct images with the pore space color coded by the relative concentration c c0 the peak value of iron concentration measured by the c c0 ratio decreased from 0 98 to 0 87 which indicates an increase in np retention over time the iron recovery which measures the ratio between the amount of iron collected at the outlet and the amount of iron injected into the core was calculated from the icp measurements of the effluent samples and is 73 identifying net retention of nps in the sandstone core there was however no observable clogging phenomenon since there was no detectable change in the pressure drop between the inlet and outlet this is also consistent with the observation that the modified nzvi particles are unlikely to aggregate jia and wang 2013 4 discussion in this section we discuss the impacts of pore structure heterogeneity as confirmed by the μct images on the transport of nps by comparing transport parameters obtained using two sets of simulations with different assumptions of the pore structure the spatial heterogeneity of the three dimensional structure of the sandstone was confirmed by μct imaging pores within the sandstone were distributed with an average diameter of 35 μm binarization of the μct images recovers an average porosity of 0 203 which is close to the ratio of the volumes of the aqueous phase to the core however the connected porosity varies spatially along the core with four distinct regions observed fig 6 region ⅰ has the highest connected porosity and region iii from slice 6 to slice 13 the lowest spatial heterogeneity of the pore structure i e the presence of well connected flow paths and poorly connected pores or dead end pores as inferred from the experimental concentration data is further highlighted in fig 7 connectivity analysis and skeletonization were performed using avizo to define the 3d digital structure of the sandstone the skeletonization module extracts the centerlines of interconnected pore regions and calculates a distance map that measures the distance of a voxel in the pore space to the nearest solid phase from the segmented images the 3d skeleton consists of nodes and tubes and defines the topology the nodes are the branching points and endpoints connected by the tubes whose thickness depends on the maximum value on the distance map dead end pores are highlighted orange dotted circles in fig 7b with the prescribed network allowing flow calculations on a subsection of the sample avizo xlab hydro module streamlines see fig 7c show the relative velocity field with red defining the higher velocity preferential flow paths that likely act as fast channels for np transport hydrus 1d was used to simulate flow using the experimental observations of concentration history to invert for the transport parameters dispersion coefficient d attachment coefficient kac and detachment coefficient kdc porosity and permeability were prescribed based on the experimental observations the advection dispersion equation was coupled with the first order attachment detachment kinetics and solved using the internal hydrus 1d optimization routine aggregation and clogging were not considered based on the experimental observations discussed above straining of the nps was also considered to be negligible and not included in the model because the ratio of the particle diameter to the median pore diameter was less than the threshold for straining 0 005 bradford et al 2004 modeling was first performed assuming a homogeneous pore structure with an average connected porosity of 0 203 flow parameters were evaluated by fitting the concentration data of slice 15 the outlet between 0 and 120 min similar to a standard breakthrough curve btc analysis commonly adopted when spatial data are not available fig 8 presents the experimental data and the fitted concentration results overall using values of 0 16 mm2 min 0 018 min 1 and 0 07 min 1 for d kac and kdc respectively the simulation fits the experimental data with a goodness of fit value r2 of 96 9 table 1 to evaluate the extent to which the transport parameters derived following the standard btc analysis can be applied to evaluate concentration evolution within the core simulations were performed using the btcs of four slices slice 2 5 10 14 these locations correspond to the centers of the four distinct porosity regions identified as fig 6 for these simulations each region was assigned a unique set of hydraulic properties the permeability was estimated from the average connected porosity of the region based on the kozeny carman relationship the transport parameters of the upstream region were first evaluated and used for the fitting of the transport parameters of the downstream region fig 9 shows the simulation results for the four regions while the goodness of fit values r2 ranging from 90 5 to 96 1 table 1 are not as high as for the homogeneous model the improved performance is highlighted by the low overall residual sum of squares which are 0 114 0 138 0 074 and 0 041 for different slices in contrast using the transport parameters derived from the standard btc analysis and assuming a homogeneous pore structure for the simulation of the local btcs the residual sum of squares is 0 276 0 290 0 328 and 0 044 the improved performance due to the consideration of spatial heterogeneity is most evident for region iii transport parameters kac and kdc recovered from simulations indicate the considerable impact of mechanical electrostatic trapping and subsequent detachment of nps on transport processes with respect to residual nps comparing the performance of the two simulations further highlights the need of considering spatial heterogeneity nevertheless some discrepancies between the experimental data and the simulations are observed principally in the tail of the concentration distribution in spite of identifying the attachment detachment effects this may result from the presence of dead end pores with this confirmed by the connectivity analysis completed using the avizo visualization software this effect cannot be accounted for in a purely 1d model the fitted parameters in different regions vary considerably indicating the importance of spatial heterogeneity in controlling np transport in general d and kdc are smaller in the lower porosity region whereas kac is larger table 1 collectively they result in reduced spreading and increased retention of the nps a higher attachment rate was observed in the lower permeability porous medium due to the effect of hydraulic conductivity and surface area he et al 2009 these simulations demonstrate that although the standard btc analysis with the assumption of homogeneity provides a reasonably good fitting for the overall transport process it fails to capture concentration evolution within the core this is the case even though the degree of heterogeneity in the synthetic core sample used in our experiment is limited thus the impacts of increased local heterogeneity are expected to be even more significant in natural heterogeneous systems and to be important when regions of certain hydraulic properties need to be targeted the spatial temporal data measured using the se spi sequences provide necessary information to investigate spatial heterogeneity and to quantify advection dispersion and attachment detachment mechanisms and their controls on the fate of colloidal particles in structured heterogeneous porous media overall the se spi sequences of low field nmr provide an effective method to monitor the transport process of nanoparticles in rocks given its high resolution this method may also be applied to low permeability geomaterials e g carbonates and shales however some limitations of the technique should be noted first the relaxivity of paramagnetic nps is the key parameter to quantify concentrations from nmr data the calibration of relaxivity may be affected by the presence of paramagnetic substances with local magnetic field fluctuations which may be the case in granites second the nmr data provided by this method are the spectra representing multiple slices of defined thickness the spatial resolution of data therefore depends on the number of slices set for the se spi sequences but signal to noise ratio decreases as the number of subdivided slices increases 5 conclusions for the first time this study used se spi sequences based on low field nmr to successfully monitor the transport of modified nzvi particles in a consolidated sandstone the ability of se spi to simultaneously monitor multiple profiles along the core allows non invasive observation of the transport of paramagnetic nps iron concentrations were recovered through the relaxivity constant from the direct inversion of the spatio temporal data this study contributes an improved understanding of np mobility in porous media to illuminate the important impacts of spatial heterogeneity on transport processes via cross confirmation using simulations and μct imaging experimental observations including i the more rapid migration of the front first detected at 15 mins relative to bulk transport of the injected solution of nps and ii the retention of nps with 27 of the iron retained at the conclusion of deionized water flushing highlight the important controls of complex pore structure on the resulting retardation attenuation and efflux of nps complementary numerical simulations evaluate sample heterogeneity and its effects on local transport properties transport parameters are inverted from the concentration data using two set of simulations and are compared to consider the impacts of spatial heterogeneity in general the model considering four regions of distinct porosities shows improved performance as highlighted by the low overall residual sum of squares 0 041 to 0 138 compared to another model assuming a homogeneous pore structure 0 044 to 0 328 in addition results show that the spatial heterogeneity of the transport and retention properties correlate with the pore structure extracted from μct imaging compared to the most connected region colloid dispersion d reduced from 0 20 to 0 10 cm2 min while the attachment kac increased from 0 007 to 0 025 min 1 in the lowest porosity region the presence of well connected flow paths and poorly connected or dead end pores in the sandstone results in tailing of the breakthrough curve and leads to discrepancies between experimental observations and results from equivalent medium simulations in conclusion se spi sequences using low field nmr is a promising approach for characterization of the transport retardation and attenuation of nps in heterogeneous porous media even in the presence of nano scale pores in particular and distinct from other nmr imaging methods se spi enables characterization at high resolution 2d or 3d models may be adopted in the future to consider the true impact of spatial dimension on np transport credit authorship

5752,in situ chemical oxidation isco can be used as a technique for in situ arsenic as removal from groundwater naclo as an oxidant was intermittently injected into an anoxic aquifer with high aqueous as and fe concentrations which is located on the jianghan plain jhp the aim was to promote the formation of hydrous ferric oxide hfo and oxidize arsenite to arsenate thus immobilization aqueous arsenate via adsorption and or co precipitation a three dimensional reactive transport model was developed to determine the hydrogeochemical processes responsible for as im mobilization during the field trial the modeling results indicate that the variation of aso3 3 concentration can be divided into adsorption non equilibrium and adsorption equilibrium stage in adsorption non equilibrium stage oxidation and accompanying adsorption onto the surface of hfo causes the rapid decrease of aso3 3 concentration however the modeled aso3 3 concentrations were lower than measured concentrations in adsorption equilibrium stage which may be due to aso3 3 desorption from the surface of hfo as advantages of other competitive ions comparison of field data and modeling results suggest the product of the oxidative hydrolysis of fe2 aq in the field experiment was ferrihydrite the concentration of total as was mainly affected by the hfo content and concentration of competitive adsorption ions in groundwater the natural groundwater flow field led to a difference in the concentration of hfo upstream and downstream of the injection well where the downstream well had a higher hfo content and lower total as concentration hco3 was the dominant surface species affecting the adsorption of aso4 3 by hfo there is more sorption site on hfo surface due to the oxidation of adsorbed fe2 and then resulted in an increase in adsorbed h2sio3 aq and mg2 aq content on the surface of the hfo over the course of the experiment the reactive transport modeling rtm results reasonably match with observed concentrations of hydrochemical ions indicating rtm can explain the crucial chemical processes in this in situ as remediation trial providing important technical guidance for similar remediation operations keywords in situ as contaminated groundwater immobilization chemical oxidation reactive transport modeling 1 introduction geogenic arsenic as contamination of groundwater is a global concern affecting over 150 million people who are exposed to unsafe total as concentrations in drinking water singh et al 2015 in the most impacted countries such as bangladesh india cambodia argentina chile the usa and china a major exposure route to as is drinking water sourced from contaminated groundwater wang et al 2018 van phan et al 2018 he and charlet 2013 fendorf et al 2010 kocar et al 2008 guo et al 2016 xie et al 2015 long term intake of high as groundwater can cause arsenicosis and even various kinds of fatal cancers ravenscroft et al 2009 sharma et al 2014 to eliminate this threat the development of efficient technologies for the treatment of as contaminated groundwater is urgently needed various remediation technologies have been developed to remove as from contaminated groundwater elcik et al 2013 molinari and argurio 2017 vieira et al 2017 iron fe based materials such as ferric hydroxides have been widely proposed for as removal from groundwater anke et al 2013 callegari et al 2018 fu et al 2014 luong et al 2018 xie et al 2016 sun et al 2016 in situ chemical oxidation isco is a potentially cost efficient technology for the remediation of as contaminated groundwater sharma et al 2000 this method directly delivers iron salts and oxidants into aquifers to achieve as immobilization xie et al 2016 brunsting and mcbean 2014 rahman et al 2015 in the presence of oxidants iron salts can be changed to ferric hydroxides and immobilize as by physical and or chemical adsorption sarkar and paul 2016 despite its potential efficacy as immobilization by in situ oxidation of ferrous ion to ferric hydroxides remains challenging to apply in practice for example estimating the remediation effect in a given as contaminated aquifer is difficult due to a lack of detailed process understanding about the as immobilization mechanism xie et al 2016 appelo et al 1999 the as retention mechanism achieved by isco is mainly due to adsorption and co precipitation reactions between arsenate and ferric hydroxides xie et al 2016 however these processes can be impacted by a variety of factors such as the presence of hydrochemical species in groundwater including hco3 po4 3 and h2sio3 aq wallis et al 2010 appelo et al 1999 su and puls 2001 therefore determining the processes that affect the immobilization of aqueous as by isco technology is urgently needed as this would inform the design of a prediction and evaluation tool that could provide guidance for large scale remediation operations reactive transport modeling rtm has previously been applied to the remediation of as contaminated groundwater appelo and de vet 2003 developed a one dimensional 1d reactive transport model to simulate key hydrogeochemical reactions during subsurface as removal operation charlet et al 2007 coupled field monitoring and reactive transport modeling to study the controlling geochemical processes of as cycling in aquifer of chakdaha india wallis et al 2010 built a three dimensional 3d rtm to evaluate managed aquifer recharge mar processes rahman et al 2015 improved the rtm by simulating kinetic oxidation of both fe2 aq and arenite jing et al 2018 constructed a two dimensional 2d rtm combined with laboratory findings to analysis as immobilization via iron mineral transformation under advective flows to inform the design of more efficient and sustainable in situ remediation schemes the objectives of this study were to 1 implement an in situ as remediation operation based on isco technology 2 develop a 3d modeling approach to simulate the entire remediation process and 3 obtain mechanistic insight into the interplay of the hydrodynamic and hydrogeochemical processes responsible for the im mobilization of as during an isco operation to achieve those goals we conducted isco experiment with naclo as oxidant in a high as and high fe aquifer at the jianghan plain and built a rtm based on pht3d multi component transport model package to simulate the field trial 2 field site and experimental description 2 1 study site the jianghan plain jhp is an inland depositional basin along the yangtze river in china fig 1 the jhp is an important fishery and agricultural base in china being a low elevation alluvial basin influenced by the yangtze river and the han river fig 1 shen et al 2019 high total as concentrations in groundwater in the jhp have become a major water quality concern gan et al 2014 lu et al 2017 the jiahe village of xiantao county fig 1 southeast of jhp 38 180 n 113 611e was selected for the field trial because total as concentrations in some wells at this site are 50 times higher than who drinking water guidelines 10 μg l gan et al 2014 fig 1 location of field site and well w1 as concentration in groundwater around the field site were obtained from gan et al 2014 the field trial targeted the middle pore confined aquifer which has a relatively uniform thickness and top and bottom elevations of 42 and 8 m above mean sea level amsl respectively this aquifer is mainly composed of blue gray or gray fine sand with good permeability and contains a small number of fine interbedded layers in some areas and a very small number of thin silty clay layers the groundwater flow direction of the target aquifer is from west to east within the range of the field site and the average hydraulic gradient is about 0 02 the estimated groundwater flow velocity of the study site is about 0 01 m day shen et al 2019 2 2 isco experiment an in situ chemical oxidation experiment was conducted in well w1 fig 1 which was constructed with a 3 cm diameter tube a depth of 25 m and a perforated screen length of 10 m naclo as an oxidant was injected intermittently into the target aquifer with ferric hydroxides expected to form on the surface of aquifer sediments once naclo oxidized aqueous and or adsorbed fe2 in brief the procedure of each sampling injection idling cycle was as follows 1 sample groundwater with peristaltic pump 2 pump 16 l of naclo 36 5 mmol l solution into the target aquifer through well w1 within 2 min and 3 idle several hours a total of 17 sampling injection idling cycles were conducted during the field trial fig s1 is a schematic illustrating the isco experiment before and during the field trial hydrochemical parameters of groundwater samples from well w1 and injected solution including ph temperature t electrical conductivity ec and redox potential eh were measured on site using a calibrated portable multimeter model hq40d hach company the aqueous ferrous ion concentration was also measured on site using the ferrozine method and a spectrophotometer model dr2800 hach company alkalinity was measured in the field laboratory immediately after sampling all groundwater samples were collected in pre cleansed 50 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles after filtration 0 45 μm samples for major cation and trace metal concentrations were acidified with ultra pure hno3 to ph 2 immediately after collection and filtration samples for anions were not acidified on site separation of as species aso4 3 and aso3 3 was conducted using an lc sax solid phase extraction spe tube the samples collected for as species determination were acidified using ultra pure hcl to ph 2 and stored in 50 ml cleaned hdpe bottles 2 3 laboratory analysis the total as concentration in the groundwater was measured by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hg afs afs 9130 titan concentrations of major cations k na ca mg si and mn were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes iris intrepid ii xsp thermo scientific the concentration of anion including f cl so4 2 and po4 3 in the groundwater were measured using ion chromatography ic 761 compact ic metrohm ltd random duplicates of all cation and anion analyses returned an error below 5 and field and laboratory blanks were below detection limits for all species 3 reactive transport modeling the 3d simulation was set up in gms 10 4 software aquaveo groundwater flow model was first simulated using the modflow package in gms and then the reactive transport model was developed using the pht3d package based on the flow model 3 1 groundwater flow model we modeled the remediation process as injecting naclo into 10 m thick homogeneous confined aquifer there was no natural hydrogeological boundary near the field site and the fluctuation of the confined water head at the field site was small during the simulation period therefore the contour of the hydraulic head around well w1 was regarded as the dirichlet boundary the distance between well w1 and the dirichlet boundary was calculated by fitting the model with pumping test results as follows 1 treat well w1 as a pumping well in the model 2 set observation well o1 and o2 along the flow direction 2 5 m and 5 m away from well w1 fig 1 respectively 3 create an a a 10 m3 cube model centered on well w1 4 use the target aquifer permeability coefficient 13 8 14 5 m d and water storage coefficient 0 0028 0 003 calculated in the pumping experiment as constraining conditions and 5 continuously change the magnitude of a until the pumping test drawdown time curve calculated by the model fits well with experimentally measured values to determine the a value the groundwater flow model was built based on a final range of 43 m 43 m 10 m with the subdivision results shown in fig s2 selected grid cell sizes increase from 0 5 m near the injection well to 1 5 m near the outer model fringes and the target aquifer ca 15 25 m below ground level was separated into 2 layers after the model range was determined the steady head at the horizontal center well w1 was 20 6 m the flow direction was from west to east and the natural hydraulic gradient was 0 02 therefore the specified heads on the east and west sides were 20 596 and 20 604 m respectively the north and south sides were also regarded as dirichlet boundaries and the value of specified head was the linear interpolation of the west and east heads hydrogeological parameters of the model were based on hydrogeological test results key parameters listed in table 1 and other parameters were set using the default values in modflow 3 2 reactive transport model after completing the groundwater flow model a reactive transport model was built based on the pht3d package in this model each single injection process was modeled as injecting naclo solution at a flow rate of 11 52 m3 d with a total injection duration of 2 min and we generalized the reactive processes in the isco experiment with the main reaction processes divided into three categories redox reaction dissolution precipitation and adsorption desorption because the reaction database required in pht3d is consistent with the phreeqc database the general reaction procedures and parameters came from the default database wateq4f dat and llnl dat in phreeqc 3 2 1 redox reactions in groundwater during injection experiment because the concentration of naclo 36 5 mmol l was much higher than o2 0 26 mmol l saturated dissolved o2 at 25 c in injection solution thus the presence of o2 was not considered in the injection solution to simplify the model therefore we treated naclo as the only oxidizing agent in redox reactions the ions in jhp groundwater that can undergo oxidation with naclo and are considered here include fe2 aq aso3 3 and mn2 aq to specifically analyze the change in concentration of these three ions during the isco experiment the redox reaction processes of these three ions with naclo were modified to kinetic reactions by decoupling different valence states of those ions in the phreeqc database and the log k value for cl 1 cl 1 couple came from llnl database when fe2 aq and aso3 3 react with naclo they are eventually oxidized to form ferric hydroxide precipitates and aso4 3 respectively xie et al 2016 dissolved mn2 can be oxidized to mn7 in alkaline solution by clo although mno2 precipitation may form in the oxidation process the only oxidation product of mn2 considered was mn7 to facilitate the expression of mn2 consumption in the reaction model without addition of manganese oxides the oxidation of mn2 aq was regarded as a second order kinetic reaction the kinetic rate equations of these three reactions are described as follows 1 r fe i i k 1 oh 2 c clo c f e i i 2 r as i i i k 2 c clo c a s i i i 3 r mn i i k 3 c clo c a s i i i where oh is oh activity mol l c clo c fe i i and c as i i i are the concentrations of clo fe2 aq and aso3 3 respectively mol l and k1 l3mol 3s 1 k2 lmol 1s 1 and k3 lmol 1s 1 are rate constants fitted according to the experimental results table 2 3 2 2 dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals the calculated saturation index si of calcite in the target aquifer was 0 6 which represents a supersaturated state this indicates calcite is extremely likely to exist in the aquifer and as such calcite dissolution precipitation may also occur in the isco experiment therefore the calcite precipitation dissolution process was introduced into the reaction model according to previous study plummer et al 1978 the kinetic precipitation dissolution equation for calcite is 4 r cal k 1 h k 2 co 2 k 3 h 2 o a cal v m m 0 cal 0 67 where brackets indicate activities k1 k2 and k3 are temperature dependent constants cm 2s 1 with k 1 10 0 198 440 t k 2 10 2 84 2177 t and k 3 10 5 86 317 t acal v is the ratio of initial calcite surface area to solution volume cm2 l and m 0 is the initial calcite content mol l table 2 because the calcite content was not quantitatively measured in the experiment the initial concentration was calculated based on hydrochemical data 3 2 3 adsorption desorption of major ions the adsorption and desorption processes of major ions in the isco trial can be generalized to cation exchange and surface complexation the solutes participating in cation exchange in the reaction model were na aq k aq ca2 aq and mg2 aq and their respective cation exchange coefficients from the phreeqc database were used in the model the initial exchange amounts nax kx fex2 mgx2 and cax2 were obtained by model fitting table 2 the surface complexation process corresponded to the adsorption of as aso4 3 and aso3 3 hco3 so4 2 fe2 aq f mg2 aq mn2 aq and h2sio3 aq on the ferric hydroxide surface the fe2 aq was mainly derived from the initial groundwater solution and ferric hydroxides were mainly derived from the oxidation of fe2 aq to simplify the model the initial ferric hydroxides surface was regarded as the ferric hydroxides surface in the model following rahman et al 2015 in this study modeling of adsorption and desorption processes adopted the double layer surface complexation model developed by dzombak et al 1990 in the model thermodynamic constants the density of strong and weak sites and the surface area of ferric hydroxides are considered the key parameters that determine the complexation reaction and its progress to better match the simulation results with the experimental data the density of strong and weak sites and the surface area of hydrous ferric oxide were adjusted according to rahman et al 2015 table 3 in addition the surface complexation reactions and constants used in the model for goethite were adapted from stollenwerk et al 2007 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemistry of the field site the groundwater from the study area was ca mg hco3 type water with circumneutral ph 7 15 moderate to high ec 916 μs cm and negative eh values 119 8 mv the concentrations of total as 6 7 μmol l fe2 aq 0 23 mmol l mn2 aq 0 397 mmol l ca2 aq 4 12 mmol l and na aq 1 89 mmol l were all higher than the mean valuesof jhp groundwater the concentration of mg2 aq 1 49 mmol l and hco3 12 39 mmol l were comparable with the mean values of jhp groundwater table 4 4 2 reactive transport modelling of field trial 4 2 1 groundwater flow model the groundwater flow model forms the basis for the reactive transport model by maintaining the hydraulic gradient in the flow model and setting the hydraulic head in the south and north as the linear interpolation of that in the east and west a steady groundwater flow field was calculated by the model that was consistent with the natural flow field fig 2 a the flow field calculated by the flow model for steady flow was consistent with the natural groundwater flow field if any contours of the hydraulic head on both sides of well w1 were simply regarded as dirichlet boundary conditions however different positioning of the dirichlet boundaries would lead to changes in the hydraulic head due to transient flow water pumping and injection when the dirichlet boundary was close to pumping well w1 recharge of well o1 with a specific head was very fast with a drawdown was small and short recharge time thus the scope of the model required calibration using data from the pumping test conducted at the field site furthermore the drawdown time curve for well o1 and well o2 calculated by the flow model satisfactorily matched with measured values fig 2b which suggests that hydrodynamic conditions around well w1 were equivalent to actual conditions in the field fig 2 a contour of hydraulic head in the flow model b s t drawdown time curve of pumping test at well o1 and o2 the blue circles and green crosses are measured drawdown data and the solid lines are modeled drawdown 4 2 2 reactive transport modelling the modeled and measured values of 10 hydrochemical parameters ph as t total as aso4 3 aso3 3 mn2 aq fe2 aq ca2 aq mg2 aq na aq and k aq in the experiment are presented in fig 3 a comparison of modeled and measured results shows that changes in major ions were reasonably characterized by the rtm chemical components such as aso4 3 fe2 aq and mn2 aq were directly involved in redox reactions and concentrations thereof continuously declined with each injection of naclo solution fig 3 measured concentrations of fe2 aq were very low 0 3 mg l compared with the initial concentration of 12 7 mg l before the third injection and below the detection limit after the fifth injection this means the oxidation of fe2 aq by clo was very rapid modelling results fit well with measured results in this respect this also further illustrates it is reasonable to employ a dynamic oxidation equation between clo and fe2 aq in the model measured concentrations of aso3 3 aq remained in a range from 0 43 to 0 45 μmol l after the third injection modeled aso3 3 aq concentrations were notably lower than measured concentrations after the third injection all these indicate that aso3 3 aq concentrations was controlled by an adsorption non equilibrium and an adsorption equilibrium during the field trial before the third injection aso3 3 aq concentrations decreased due to oxidation and accompanying sorption interactions with hfo which is an adsorption non equilibrium process the rapid decrease in aso3 3 aq concentrations and increase in aso4 3 aq concentrations can be attributed to a large amount of fe2 aq and aso3 3 aq rapid oxidation before the third injection in the adsorption equilibrium stage after the third injection the effect of co exist competitive sorption ions hco3 fe2 aq so4 2 become more and more obvious which might cause some amount of aso4 3 desorbed from hfo surface into groundwater our previous study also demonstrated that concentrations of aso3 3 aq remained largely invariant after 30 h injection with a high molar ratio of fe as in sediments in addition concentrations of measured aso4 3 aq exhibited an increasing trend after each injection in the adsorption equilibrium stage which was attributed to the desorption of a small amount of aso3 3 aq from the hfo xie et al 2016 the overall agreement between modeled and measured mn2 aq concentrations indicates that kinetic reactive equations between mn2 aq and naclo are also applicable in the model the decreasing mn2 aq concentrations were mainly due to oxidation by naclo although mn2 aq could adsorb on the surface of hfo the process was not obvious in the model discussed below the model fit for ca2 aq mg2 aq na aq and k aq is reasonable which indicates that the cation exchange process was modeled correctly in the model fig 3 comparison of reactive transport modeling results solid red line with field measured results blue circles 4 3 effects of ferric hydroxide species on as immobilization ferrous ion can be precipitated as goethite and ferrihydrite in weakly and strongly alkaline solutions respectively in the presence of sufficient oxidants bordoloi et al 2013 our previous study indicated the oxidative hydrolysis of fe2 aq resulted in the production of goethite via in situ oxidation by naclo in the datong basin china xie et al 2016 the transformation from amorphous ferrihydrite to goethite and hematite was influenced by ph with ferrihydrite converting more easily to goethite schwertmann and murad 1983 concentrations of aso4 3 in groundwater were modeled and are presented in fig 4 in this model ferrihydrite and goethite were assumed to be the oxidation hydrolysates product of fe2 aq modeled aso4 3 concentrations in well w1 are much higher than measured concentrations when the ferric hydroxide is considered to be goethite fig 4 therefore the final product of fe2 aq oxidative hydrolysis in this trial was likely ferrihydrite although goethite is more stable with a higher degree of crystallinity this is also supported by the fact that the strong and weak binding site density and surface area of goethite are much lower than ferrihydrite stollenwerk et al 2007 of course the formation of a small amount of goethite cannot be excluded however it was reasonable to set ferric hydroxide as the hydrolysate in this model according to the modeling results fig 4 concentrations of aso4 3 in groundwater black solid line represents the variation of aso4 3 concentrations when the ferric hydroxide was regarded as goethite red solid line represents the variation of aso4 3 concentrations when the ferric hydroxide was considered to be ferrihydrite blue circles represent measured concentrations of aso4 3 4 4 effects of hfo content on as immobilization the amount of total as in the groundwater gradually decreased in each injection stage fig 3 b this may be related to the sorption of aso4 3 and the formation of hfo the hfo content around well w1 increased quickly before the third injection green dashed line in fig 5 b concurrent with a rapid decrease in fe2 aq fig 3 c after which the rapid rate of hfo formation began to slow fig 5 hfo at w1 as a result the amount of sorption site on the hfo surface increased at a relatively slow rate fig 5 shows that almost all of the fe2 aq had been converted to hfo after the third injection note that amount of the total fe fe2 aq fe3 aq and hfo gradually increased starting just after the second injection 3 06 h blue dashed line in fig 5b and then continued to rise the continued increase in hfo at well w1 is because fe2 aq brought from the upstream was rapidly oxidized hydrolyzed and transformed into hfo by naclo the concentrations of naclo at wells c1 and c2 were lower than at w1 indicating more fe2 aq was transported via convection and dispersion than immobilized by oxidation as a result the total fe at wells c1 and c2 gradually decreased during the field trial fig 5 however because well c2 is downstream of well w1 and a large amount of fe2 aq was fixed at around well w1 by oxidation less aqueous ferrous arrived at c2 respect to c1 fig 5a exhibits the distribution of the total as concentrations in the first layer of the model after the experiment the scope delineated by the outermost blue solid line is the remediation area predicted by the rtm no significant variation in total as concentrations in well o1 was observed during the injection experiment according to the modeling results fig 5a the total as concentrations at c2 were lower than at c1 which is attributed to a higher hfo content at site c2 therefore the sorption of aso4 3 and or aso3 3 on hfo surfaces was of great importance during the in situ remediation experiment fig 5 a concentrations of total as at the field site after the experiment the background concentration of total as was 6 10 6 mol l blue solid line the size of each cell is 0 5 m 0 5 m b the red solid and dashed lines respectively represent the variation in total fe fe2 aq fe3 aq and hfo and hfo

represent the variations in total fe and hfo concentrations in c2 the gray dashed line is the background concentration of total fe the blue and green dashed lines respectively mark the time of the second and third injections 4 5 effects of competitive sorption on as immobilization the presence of co existing anions including po4 3 hco3 and h2sio3 aq in groundwater inhibits the sorption of aso4 3 and or aso3 3 on ferric hydroxide wallis et al 2010 appelo et al 1999 meng et al 2001 more specifically silica chromate and molybdate strongly limit aso4 3 and or aso3 3 sorption on ferric hydroxide followed by carbonate and nitrate and finally borate and sulfate su and puls 2001 the proportion of adsorbed components on hfo surfaces in native groundwater is presented in fig 6 the dominant surface species on hfo is hco3 followed by h fe2 aq aso4 3 aso3 3 h2sio3 aq and mg2 fig 6 notably aso4 3 sorption on hfo is slightly higher than aso3 3 in accordance with a previous study allison et al 1991 in general hco3 h fe2 aq and h2sio3 aq are dominant components adsorbed on hfo surfaces with the percentage of total as adsorbed on hfo undergoing small variations during the injection experiment fig 6 the concentrations of fe2 aq and aso3 3 decreased quickly due to oxidation by clo which resulted in the percentage of fe2 aq and aso3 3 adsorbed on hfo surfaces rapidly decreasing and the percentage of aso4 3 sorption rising during the early stages of the injection experiment in addition the percentage of h2sio3 aq and mg2 aq sorption obviously increased over the course of the experiment fig 6 which may be related to the oxidation of adsorbed fe2 aq however so4 2 and f had no significant competitive sorption effect during the entire injection experiment fig 6 the proportion of components adsorbed on hfo surfaces using the surface complexation model when hfo was equilibrated in groundwater the groundwater sample number sequence corresponded to experiment process each element may cover several surface species and the h element indicates the sum of all protonated or deprotonated surface sites 5 conclusion a three dimensional reactive transport model was developed to simulate key hydrogeochemical processes in isco experiment modeled results and measured concentrations of ph aso3 3 aso4 3 fe2 aq mn2 ca2 aq mg2 aq na aq and k aq in w1 had a similar trend which indicates the model provided a reasonable representation of the key chemical processes in the in situ remediation testing it s indicated that the product of ferric hydroxide in field experiment was ferrihydrite by comparing the calculation results when goethite and ferrihydrite were regarded as the final product of fe2 aq respectively concentrations of hfo and the total as around w1 suggest hfo is crucial to the sorption of as and the increasing of fe concentrations in native groundwater are beneficial for as immobilization comparing modeled and measured aso3 3 concentrations the variation of aso3 3 values is divided into adsorption non equilibrium stage and adsorption equilibrium stage in adsorption non equilibrium stage oxidation of clo and sorption on the surface of hfo causes the rapid decrease of aso3 3 concentration so the process enables a better model fit however modeled aso3 3 concentrations were lower than measured concentrations in adsorption equilibrium stage which may be responsible for aso3 3 desorption from the surface of hfo as advantages of other competitive ions the proportion variation of components adsorbed on hfo surface in groundwater indicates that hco3 is the dominant competitive ion in surface complexation interaction moreover the competitive adsorption capacity of ions is relative to their concentrations the competitive adsorption capacity of h2sio3 aq and mg2 aq on the surface of hfo is gradually increasing with decreasing in the concentrations of aqueous fe and as credit authorship contribution statement xianjun xie funding acquisition project

5752,in situ chemical oxidation isco can be used as a technique for in situ arsenic as removal from groundwater naclo as an oxidant was intermittently injected into an anoxic aquifer with high aqueous as and fe concentrations which is located on the jianghan plain jhp the aim was to promote the formation of hydrous ferric oxide hfo and oxidize arsenite to arsenate thus immobilization aqueous arsenate via adsorption and or co precipitation a three dimensional reactive transport model was developed to determine the hydrogeochemical processes responsible for as im mobilization during the field trial the modeling results indicate that the variation of aso3 3 concentration can be divided into adsorption non equilibrium and adsorption equilibrium stage in adsorption non equilibrium stage oxidation and accompanying adsorption onto the surface of hfo causes the rapid decrease of aso3 3 concentration however the modeled aso3 3 concentrations were lower than measured concentrations in adsorption equilibrium stage which may be due to aso3 3 desorption from the surface of hfo as advantages of other competitive ions comparison of field data and modeling results suggest the product of the oxidative hydrolysis of fe2 aq in the field experiment was ferrihydrite the concentration of total as was mainly affected by the hfo content and concentration of competitive adsorption ions in groundwater the natural groundwater flow field led to a difference in the concentration of hfo upstream and downstream of the injection well where the downstream well had a higher hfo content and lower total as concentration hco3 was the dominant surface species affecting the adsorption of aso4 3 by hfo there is more sorption site on hfo surface due to the oxidation of adsorbed fe2 and then resulted in an increase in adsorbed h2sio3 aq and mg2 aq content on the surface of the hfo over the course of the experiment the reactive transport modeling rtm results reasonably match with observed concentrations of hydrochemical ions indicating rtm can explain the crucial chemical processes in this in situ as remediation trial providing important technical guidance for similar remediation

contaminated groundwater sharma et al 2000 this method directly delivers iron salts and oxidants into aquifers to achieve as immobilization xie et al 2016 brunsting and mcbean 2014 rahman et al 2015 in the presence of oxidants iron salts can be changed to ferric hydroxides and immobilize as by physical and or chemical adsorption sarkar and paul 2016 despite its potential efficacy as immobilization by in situ oxidation of ferrous ion to ferric hydroxides remains challenging to apply in practice for example estimating the remediation effect in a given as contaminated aquifer is difficult due to a lack of detailed process understanding about the as immobilization mechanism xie et al 2016 appelo et al 1999 the as retention mechanism achieved by isco is mainly due to adsorption and co precipitation reactions between arsenate and ferric hydroxides xie et al 2016 however these processes can be impacted by a variety of factors such as the presence of hydrochemical species in groundwater including hco3 po4 3 and h2sio3 aq wallis et al 2010 appelo et al 1999 su and puls 2001 therefore determining the processes that affect the immobilization of aqueous as by isco technology is urgently needed as this would inform the design of a prediction and evaluation tool that could provide guidance for large scale remediation operations reactive transport modeling rtm has previously been applied to the remediation of as contaminated groundwater appelo and de vet 2003 developed a one dimensional 1d reactive transport model to simulate key hydrogeochemical reactions during

operation to achieve those goals we conducted isco experiment with naclo as oxidant in a high as and high fe aquifer at the jianghan plain and built a rtm based on pht3d multi component transport model package to simulate the field trial 2 field site and experimental description 2 1 study site the jianghan plain jhp is an inland depositional basin along the yangtze river in china fig 1 the jhp is an important fishery and agricultural base in china being a low elevation alluvial basin influenced by the yangtze river and the han river fig 1 shen et al 2019 high total as concentrations in groundwater in the jhp have become a major water quality concern gan et al 2014 lu et al 2017 the jiahe village of xiantao county fig 1 southeast of jhp 38 180 n 113 611e was selected for the field trial because total as concentrations in some wells at this site are 50 times higher than who drinking water guidelines 10 μg l gan et al 2014 fig 1 location of field site and well w1 as concentration in groundwater around the field site were obtained from gan et al 2014 the field trial targeted the middle pore confined aquifer which has a relatively uniform thickness and top and bottom elevations of 42 and 8 m above mean sea level amsl respectively this aquifer is mainly composed of blue gray or gray fine sand with good permeability and contains a small number of fine interbedded layers in some areas and a very small number of thin silty clay layers the groundwater flow direction of the target aquifer is from west to east within the range of the field site and the average hydraulic gradient is about 0 02 the estimated groundwater flow velocity of the study site is about 0 01 m day shen et al 2019 2 2 isco experiment an in situ chemical oxidation experiment was conducted in well w1 fig 1 which was constructed with a 3 cm diameter tube a depth of 25 m and a perforated screen length of 10 m naclo as an oxidant was injected intermittently into the target aquifer with ferric hydroxides expected to form on the surface of aquifer sediments once naclo oxidized aqueous and or adsorbed fe2 in brief the procedure of each sampling injection idling cycle was as follows 1 sample groundwater with peristaltic pump 2 pump 16 l of naclo 36 5 mmol l solution into the target aquifer through well w1 within 2 min and 3 idle several hours a total of 17 sampling injection idling cycles were conducted during the field trial fig s1 is a schematic illustrating the isco experiment before and during the field trial hydrochemical parameters of groundwater samples from well w1 and injected solution including ph temperature t electrical conductivity ec and redox potential eh were measured on site using a calibrated portable multimeter model hq40d hach company the aqueous ferrous ion concentration was also measured on site using the ferrozine method and a spectrophotometer model dr2800 hach company alkalinity was measured in the field laboratory immediately after sampling all groundwater samples were collected in pre cleansed 50 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles after filtration 0 45 μm samples for major cation and trace metal concentrations were acidified with ultra pure hno3 to ph 2 immediately after collection and filtration samples for anions were not acidified on site separation of as species aso4 3 and aso3 3 was conducted using an lc sax solid phase extraction spe tube the samples collected for as species determination were acidified using ultra pure hcl to ph 2 and stored in 50 ml cleaned hdpe bottles 2 3 laboratory analysis the total as concentration in the groundwater was measured by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hg afs afs 9130 titan concentrations of major cations k na ca mg si and mn were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes iris intrepid ii xsp thermo scientific the concentration of anion including f cl so4 2 and po4 3 in the groundwater were measured using ion chromatography ic 761 compact ic metrohm ltd random duplicates of all cation and anion analyses returned an error below 5 and field and laboratory blanks were below detection limits for all species 3 reactive transport modeling the 3d simulation was set up in gms 10 4 software aquaveo groundwater flow model was first simulated using the modflow package in gms and then the reactive transport model was developed using the pht3d package based on the flow model 3 1 groundwater flow model we modeled the remediation process as injecting naclo into 10 m thick homogeneous confined aquifer there was no natural hydrogeological boundary near the field site and the fluctuation of the confined water head at the field site was small during the simulation period therefore the contour of the hydraulic head around well w1 was regarded as the dirichlet boundary the distance between well w1 and the dirichlet boundary was calculated by fitting the model with pumping test results as follows 1 treat well w1 as a pumping well in the model 2 set observation well o1 and o2 along the flow direction 2 5 m and 5 m away from well w1 fig 1 respectively 3 create an a a 10 m3 cube model centered on well w1 4 use the target aquifer permeability coefficient 13 8 14 5 m d and water storage coefficient 0 0028 0 003 calculated in the pumping experiment as constraining conditions and 5 continuously change the magnitude of a until the pumping test drawdown time curve calculated by the model fits well with experimentally measured values to determine the a value the groundwater flow model was built based on a final range of 43 m 43 m 10 m with the subdivision results shown in fig s2 selected grid cell sizes increase from 0 5 m near the injection well to 1 5 m near the outer model fringes and the target aquifer ca 15 25 m below ground level was separated into 2 layers after the model range was determined the steady head at the horizontal center well w1 was 20 6 m the flow direction was from west to east and the natural hydraulic gradient was 0 02 therefore the specified heads on the east and west sides were 20 596 and 20 604 m respectively the north and south sides were also regarded as dirichlet boundaries and the value of specified head was the linear interpolation of the west and east heads hydrogeological parameters of the model were based on hydrogeological test results key parameters listed in table 1 and other parameters were set using the default values in modflow 3 2 reactive transport model after completing the groundwater flow model a reactive transport model was built based on the pht3d package in this model each single injection process was modeled as injecting naclo solution at a flow rate of 11 52 m3 d with a total injection duration of 2 min and we generalized the reactive processes in the isco experiment with the main reaction processes divided into three categories redox reaction dissolution precipitation and adsorption desorption because the reaction database required in pht3d is consistent with the phreeqc database the general reaction procedures and parameters came from the default database wateq4f dat and llnl dat in phreeqc 3 2 1 redox reactions in groundwater during injection experiment because the concentration of naclo 36 5 mmol l was much higher than o2 0 26 mmol l saturated dissolved o2 at 25 c in injection solution thus the presence of o2 was not considered in the injection solution to simplify the model therefore we treated naclo as the only oxidizing agent in redox reactions the ions in jhp groundwater that can undergo oxidation with naclo and are considered here include fe2 aq aso3 3 and mn2 aq to specifically analyze the change in concentration of these three ions during the isco experiment the redox reaction processes of these three ions with naclo were modified to kinetic reactions by decoupling different valence states of those ions in the phreeqc database and the log k value for cl 1 cl 1 couple came from llnl database when fe2 aq and aso3 3 react with naclo they are eventually oxidized to form ferric hydroxide precipitates and aso4 3 respectively xie et al 2016 dissolved mn2 can be oxidized to mn7 in alkaline solution by clo although mno2 precipitation may form in the oxidation process the only oxidation product of mn2 considered was mn7 to facilitate the expression of mn2 consumption in the reaction model without addition of manganese oxides the oxidation of mn2 aq was regarded as a second order kinetic reaction the kinetic rate equations of these three reactions are described as follows 1 r fe i i k 1 oh 2 c clo c f e i i 2 r as i i i k 2 c clo c a s i i i 3 r mn i i k 3 c clo c a s i i i where oh is oh activity mol l c clo c fe i i and c as i i i are the concentrations of clo fe2 aq and aso3 3 respectively mol l and k1 l3mol 3s 1 k2 lmol 1s 1 and k3 lmol 1s 1 are rate constants fitted according to the experimental results table 2 3 2 2 dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals the calculated saturation index si of calcite in the target aquifer was 0 6 which represents a supersaturated state this indicates calcite is extremely likely to exist in the aquifer and as such calcite dissolution precipitation may also occur in the isco experiment therefore the calcite precipitation dissolution process was introduced into the reaction model according to previous study plummer et al 1978 the kinetic precipitation dissolution equation for calcite is 4 r cal k 1 h k 2 co 2 k 3 h 2 o a cal v m m 0 cal 0 67 where brackets indicate activities k1 k2 and k3 are temperature dependent constants cm 2s 1 with k 1 10 0 198 440 t k 2 10 2 84 2177 t and k 3 10 5 86 317 t acal v is the ratio of initial calcite surface area to solution volume cm2 l and m 0 is the initial calcite content mol l table 2 because the calcite content was not quantitatively measured in the experiment the initial concentration was calculated based on hydrochemical data 3 2 3 adsorption desorption of major ions the adsorption and desorption processes of major ions in the isco trial can be generalized to cation exchange and surface complexation the solutes participating in cation exchange in the reaction model were na aq k aq ca2 aq and mg2 aq and their respective cation exchange coefficients from the phreeqc database were used in the model the initial exchange amounts nax kx fex2 mgx2 and cax2 were obtained by model fitting table 2 the surface complexation process corresponded to the adsorption of as aso4 3 and aso3 3 hco3 so4 2 fe2 aq f mg2 aq mn2 aq and h2sio3 aq on the ferric hydroxide surface the fe2 aq was mainly derived from the initial groundwater solution and ferric hydroxides were mainly derived from the oxidation of fe2 aq to simplify the model the initial ferric hydroxides surface was regarded as the ferric hydroxides surface in the model following rahman et al 2015 in this study modeling of adsorption and desorption processes adopted the double layer surface complexation model developed by dzombak et al 1990 in the model thermodynamic constants the density of strong and weak sites and the surface area of ferric hydroxides are considered the key parameters that determine the complexation reaction and its progress to better match the simulation results with the experimental data the density of strong and weak sites and the surface area of hydrous ferric oxide were adjusted according to rahman et al 2015 table 3 in addition the surface complexation reactions and constants used in the model for goethite were adapted from stollenwerk et al 2007 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemistry of the field site the groundwater from the study area was ca mg hco3 type water with circumneutral ph 7 15 moderate to high ec 916 μs cm and negative eh values 119 8 mv the concentrations of total as 6 7 μmol l fe2 aq 0 23 mmol l mn2 aq 0 397 mmol l ca2 aq 4 12 mmol l and na aq 1 89 mmol l were all higher than the mean valuesof jhp groundwater the concentration of mg2 aq 1 49 mmol l and hco3 12 39 mmol l were comparable with the mean values of jhp groundwater table 4 4 2 reactive transport modelling of field trial 4 2 1 groundwater flow model the groundwater flow model forms the basis for the reactive transport model by maintaining the hydraulic gradient in the flow model and setting the hydraulic head in the south and north as the linear interpolation of that in the east and west a steady groundwater flow field was calculated by the model that was consistent with the natural flow field fig 2 a the flow field calculated by the flow model for steady flow was consistent with the natural groundwater flow field if any contours of the hydraulic head on both sides of well w1 were simply regarded as dirichlet boundary conditions however different positioning of the dirichlet boundaries would lead to changes in the hydraulic head due to transient flow water pumping and injection when the dirichlet boundary was close to pumping well w1 recharge of well o1 with a specific head was very fast with a drawdown was small and short recharge time thus the scope of the model required calibration using data from the pumping test conducted at the field site furthermore the drawdown time curve for well o1 and well o2 calculated by the flow model satisfactorily matched with measured values fig 2b which suggests that hydrodynamic conditions around well w1 were equivalent to actual conditions in the field fig 2 a contour of hydraulic head in the flow model b s t drawdown time curve of pumping test at well o1 and o2 the blue circles and green crosses are measured drawdown data and the solid lines are modeled drawdown 4 2 2 reactive transport modelling the modeled and measured values of 10 hydrochemical parameters ph as t total as aso4 3 aso3 3 mn2 aq fe2 aq ca2 aq mg2 aq na aq and k aq in the experiment are presented in fig 3 a comparison of modeled and measured results shows that changes in major ions were reasonably characterized by the rtm chemical components such as aso4 3 fe2 aq and mn2 aq were directly involved in redox reactions and concentrations thereof continuously declined with each injection of naclo solution fig 3 measured concentrations of fe2 aq were very low 0 3 mg l compared with the initial concentration of 12 7 mg l before the third injection and below the detection limit after the fifth injection this means the oxidation of fe2 aq by clo was very rapid modelling results fit well with measured results in this respect this also further illustrates it is reasonable to employ a dynamic oxidation equation between clo and fe2 aq in the model measured concentrations of aso3 3 aq remained in a range from 0 43 to 0 45 μmol l after the third injection modeled aso3 3 aq concentrations were notably lower than measured concentrations after the third injection all these indicate that aso3 3 aq concentrations was controlled by an adsorption non equilibrium and an adsorption equilibrium during the field trial before the third injection aso3 3 aq concentrations decreased due to oxidation and accompanying sorption interactions with hfo which is an adsorption non equilibrium process the rapid decrease in aso3 3 aq concentrations and increase in aso4 3 aq concentrations can be attributed to a large amount of fe2 aq and aso3 3 aq rapid oxidation before the third injection in the adsorption equilibrium stage after the third injection the effect of co exist competitive sorption ions hco3 fe2 aq so4 2 become more and more obvious which might cause some amount of aso4 3 desorbed from hfo surface into groundwater our previous study also demonstrated that concentrations of aso3 3 aq remained largely invariant after 30 h injection with a high molar ratio of fe as in sediments in addition concentrations of measured aso4 3 aq exhibited an increasing trend after each injection in the adsorption equilibrium stage which was attributed to the desorption of a small amount of aso3 3 aq from the hfo xie et al 2016 the overall agreement between modeled and measured mn2 aq concentrations indicates that kinetic reactive equations between mn2 aq and naclo are also applicable in the model the decreasing mn2 aq concentrations were mainly due to oxidation by naclo although mn2 aq could adsorb on the surface of hfo the process was not obvious in the model discussed below the model fit for ca2 aq mg2 aq na aq and k aq is reasonable which indicates that the cation exchange process was modeled correctly in the model fig 3 comparison of reactive transport modeling results solid red line with field measured results blue circles 4 3 effects of ferric hydroxide species on as immobilization ferrous ion can be precipitated as goethite and ferrihydrite in weakly and strongly alkaline solutions respectively in the presence of sufficient oxidants bordoloi et al 2013 our previous study indicated the oxidative hydrolysis of fe2 aq resulted in the production of goethite via in situ oxidation by naclo in the datong basin china xie et al 2016 the transformation from amorphous ferrihydrite to goethite and hematite was influenced by ph with ferrihydrite converting more easily to goethite schwertmann and murad 1983 concentrations of aso4 3 in groundwater were modeled and are presented in fig 4 in this model ferrihydrite and goethite were assumed to be the oxidation hydrolysates product of fe2 aq modeled aso4 3 concentrations in well w1 are much higher than measured concentrations when the ferric hydroxide is considered to be goethite fig 4 therefore the final product of fe2 aq oxidative hydrolysis in this trial was likely ferrihydrite although goethite is more stable with a higher degree of crystallinity this is also supported by the fact that the strong and weak binding site density and surface area of goethite are much lower than ferrihydrite stollenwerk et al 2007 of course the formation of a small amount of goethite cannot be excluded however it was reasonable to set ferric hydroxide as the hydrolysate in this model according to the modeling results fig 4 concentrations of aso4 3 in groundwater black solid line represents the variation of aso4 3 concentrations when the ferric hydroxide was regarded as goethite red solid line represents the variation of aso4 3 concentrations when the ferric hydroxide was considered to be ferrihydrite blue circles represent measured concentrations of aso4 3 4 4 effects of hfo content on as immobilization the amount of total as in the groundwater gradually decreased in each injection stage fig 3 b this may be related to the sorption of aso4 3 and the formation of hfo the hfo content around well w1 increased quickly before the third injection green dashed line in fig 5 b concurrent with a rapid decrease in fe2 aq fig 3 c after which the rapid rate of hfo formation began to slow fig 5 hfo at w1 as a result the amount of sorption site on the hfo surface increased at a relatively slow rate fig 5 shows that almost all of the fe2 aq had been converted to hfo after the third injection note that amount of the total fe fe2 aq fe3 aq and hfo gradually increased starting just after the second injection 3 06 h blue dashed line in fig 5b and then continued to rise the continued increase in hfo at well w1 is because fe2 aq brought from the upstream was rapidly oxidized hydrolyzed and transformed into hfo by naclo the concentrations of naclo at wells c1 and c2 were lower than at w1 indicating more fe2 aq was transported via convection and dispersion than immobilized by oxidation as a result the total fe at wells c1 and c2 gradually decreased during the field trial fig 5 however because well c2 is downstream of well w1 and a large amount of fe2 aq was fixed at around well w1 by oxidation less aqueous ferrous arrived at c2 respect to c1 fig 5a exhibits the distribution of the total as concentrations in the first layer of the model after the experiment the scope delineated by the outermost blue solid line is the remediation area predicted by the rtm no significant variation in total as concentrations in well o1 was observed during the injection experiment according to the modeling results fig 5a the total as concentrations at c2 were lower than at c1 which is attributed to a higher hfo content at site c2 therefore the sorption of aso4 3 and or aso3 3 on hfo surfaces was of great importance during the in situ remediation experiment fig 5 a concentrations of total as at the field site after the experiment the background concentration of total as was 6 10 6 mol l blue solid line the size of each cell is 0 5 m 0 5 m b the red solid and dashed lines respectively represent the variation in total fe fe2 aq fe3 aq and hfo and hfo

second and third injections 4 5 effects of competitive sorption on as immobilization the presence of co existing anions including po4 3 hco3 and h2sio3 aq in groundwater inhibits the sorption of aso4 3 and or aso3 3 on ferric hydroxide wallis et al 2010 appelo et al 1999 meng et al 2001 more specifically silica chromate and molybdate strongly limit aso4 3 and or aso3 3 sorption on ferric hydroxide followed by carbonate and nitrate and finally borate and sulfate su and puls 2001 the proportion of adsorbed components on hfo surfaces in native groundwater is presented in fig 6 the dominant surface species on hfo is hco3 followed by h fe2 aq aso4 3 aso3 3 h2sio3 aq and mg2 fig 6 notably aso4 3 sorption on hfo is slightly higher than aso3 3 in accordance with a previous study allison et al 1991 in general hco3 h fe2 aq and h2sio3 aq are dominant components adsorbed on hfo surfaces with the percentage of total as adsorbed on hfo undergoing small variations during the injection experiment fig 6 the concentrations of fe2 aq and aso3 3 decreased quickly due to oxidation by clo which resulted in the percentage of fe2 aq and aso3 3 adsorbed on hfo surfaces rapidly decreasing and the percentage of aso4 3 sorption rising during the early stages of the injection experiment in addition the percentage of h2sio3 aq and mg2 aq sorption obviously increased over the course of the experiment fig 6 which may be related to the oxidation of adsorbed fe2 aq however so4 2 and f had no significant competitive sorption effect during the entire injection experiment fig 6 the proportion of components adsorbed on hfo surfaces using the surface complexation model when hfo was equilibrated in groundwater the groundwater sample number sequence corresponded to experiment process each element may cover several surface species and the h element indicates the sum of all protonated or deprotonated surface sites 5 conclusion a three dimensional reactive transport model was developed to simulate key hydrogeochemical processes in isco experiment modeled results and measured concentrations of ph aso3 3 aso4 3 fe2 aq mn2 ca2 aq mg2 aq na aq and k aq in w1 had a similar trend which indicates the model provided a reasonable representation of the key chemical processes in the in situ remediation testing it s indicated that the product of ferric hydroxide in field experiment was ferrihydrite by comparing the calculation results when goethite and ferrihydrite were regarded as the final product of fe2 aq respectively concentrations of hfo and the total as around w1 suggest hfo is crucial to the sorption of as and the increasing of fe concentrations in native groundwater are beneficial for as immobilization comparing modeled and measured aso3 3 concentrations the variation of aso3 3 values is divided into adsorption non equilibrium stage and adsorption equilibrium stage in adsorption non equilibrium stage oxidation of clo and sorption on the surface of hfo causes the rapid decrease of aso3 3 concentration so the process enables a better model fit however modeled aso3 3 concentrations were lower than measured concentrations in adsorption equilibrium stage which may be responsible for aso3 3 desorption from the surface of hfo as advantages of other competitive ions the proportion variation of components adsorbed on hfo surface in groundwater indicates that hco3 is the dominant competitive ion in surface complexation interaction moreover the competitive adsorption capacity of ions is relative to their concentrations the competitive adsorption capacity of h2sio3 aq and mg2 aq on the surface of hfo is gradually increasing with decreasing in the concentrations of aqueous fe and as credit authorship contribution statement xianjun xie funding acquisition project

5753,in the current changing climate the importance of temporal stability of hydrological models is increasing the objective of this paper is to assess the effects of the changing weight of snow ws in a multiple objective calibration of a conceptual hydrological model in terms of the temporal stability of runoff and snow model efficiency and hydrologic model parameters the methodology was tested by a lumped conceptual hydrological model the tuw model which was calibrated and validated in 213 austrian catchments in two climatically different decades i e 1981 1990 and 2001 2010 the results indicate that the runoff and snow model efficiencies are almost insensitive to a large range of ws i e from 0 to 0 9 for the runoff and from 0 75 to 1 0 for the snow this relationship is similar in the two different decades however the calibration runoff model efficiency i e nash sutcliffe efficiency was about 5 to 10 greater in flatland catchments in the warmer decade 2001 2010 the main impact of ws on the snow model efficiency is the reduction of snow underestimation errors in the flatland catchments the relative improvement of the snow simulations in the validation periods is greater in the flatland catchments and is in a range of 45 60 compared to 13 and 31 in the alpine catchments the evaluation of the temporal stability indicates that increasing the weight of the snow increases the temporal stability of the degree day factor and the parameters of the snowfall and rainfall thresholds a change in the weight of the snow has the greatest impact on glacerized catchments which were the most sensitive to changes in the mean annual air temperature between the two decades keywords multiple objective calibration tuw model efficiency of model temporal stability of the parameters of the model 1 introduction the accurate estimation of water balance components is necessary for solving many water related scientific and practical problems such as e g operational flood forecasting estimations of the potential of hydropower reservoir management flood risk assessments e g nester et al 2016 farkas et al 2016 the use of conceptual water balance models for such applications is associated with several challenges that include the reduction of uncertainty in the estimation of model parameters and their temporal stability merz et al 2011 these challenges are particularly acute in mountainous alpine regions where data are poor or insufficient and where the heterogeneity and spatial variability of the hydrological characteristics is great parajka and blöschl 2008 previous studies e g beldring 2002 parajka et al 2007 parajka et al 2009 finger et al 2011 finger et al 2015 nijzink et al 2018 inter alia have demonstrated that the multi objective calibration of hydrological models serves as an effective way to improve the consistency of the internal states of hydrological models and allows for a significant reduction in the uncertainty of model parameters different types of ground based or satellite observations of for example groundwater levels madsen 2003 soil moisture parajka et al 2006 parajka et al 2009 water storage lo et al 2010 tian et al 2017 evapotranspiration zhang et al 2017 kunnath poovakka et al 2016 snow cover characteristics parajka and blöschl 2008 sorman et al 2009 duethmann et al 2014 isenstein et al 2015 finger et al 2015 lópez et al 2016 riboust et al 2018 tuo et al 2018 glacier characteristics omani et al 2017 or combinations thereof nijzink et al 2018 have been proven to constrain conceptual hydrological models the results of these studies indicate that while including additional data in a model s calibration improves the accuracy of the internal state variables the efficiency of the runoff model does not significantly decrease this has been particularly observed in mountainous areas where the use of additional snow cover data improves the calibration of hydrological models for example udnaes et al 2007 reported that calibration based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis snow cover in addition to runoff improves the simulation of a snow covered area finger et al 2011 2015 showed that modis snow cover glacier mass balance and hourly discharges improve a runoff model s efficiency similar results have been reported by koboltschnig et al 2008 who showed that combination of hourly discharge snow covered area sca and glacier mass balances has potential for hourly discharge simulation sorman et al 2009 showed that inclusion of sca into model calibration has potential for runoff simulations tuo et al 2018 found that only the set of parameters obtained with multi objective approach i e discharge and swe provided an acceptable prediction of both discharge and swe omani et al 2017 found that that the glacier characteristics i e ela observations equilibrium line altitude of three glaciers with observed discharge data provided acceptable mass balance simulations nijzink et al 2018 in their study demonstrated that the hydrological signatures are better represented when multiple data sources i e soil moisture evaporation total water storage snow accumulation are used parajka and blöschl 2008 demonstrated that modis snow cover data can improve both runoff and snow model simulations in an independent validation period along similar lines duethmann et al 2014 reported that considering satellite derived sca in multi objective strategy data can be a good way to improve hydrological modeling the question is how multiple objective calibration affects the performance of hydrological models if used in climatically different time periods several recent studies have investigated the temporal stability and performance of hydrological models under climate variations e g oudin et al 2006 vaze et al 2010 merz et al 2011 coron et al 2012 fowler et al 2016 sleziak et al 2018 most of these studies found that models applied in different climate periods systematically overestimate or underestimate runoff but the changes are not consistent among the studies for example vaze et al 2010 and coron et al 2012 observed a tendency to overestimate mean runoff when the model parameters transfer from wet to dry periods i e when the calibration period is wetter than the validation period opposite results were presented in sleziak et al 2018 who observed an overestimation of the mean runoff when transferring a hydrological model from a colder and drier period to a wetter and warmer period the contrasting findings likely stem from differences in the climate and physiographic conditions of the study regions as well as from differences in the structure of the hydrological models applied these studies however evaluated the temporal stability of a model s efficiency or the parameters of a hydrological model for models only calibrated for runoff previous studies showed that multiple objective calibration allows a robust calibration of hydrologic models and an improvement of estimation of individual components of water balance however temporal stability of model parameters obtained by multiple objective calibration is still not understood well the main objective of this study is thus to investigate the temporal stability of model efficiency and model parameters obtained by multiple objective calibration to runoff and snow cover over contrasted climatic periods we are particularly interested in two research questions a what impact has the changing snow weight in multiple objective calibration on model performance in different climatic periods b what is the impact of changing snow weight on the temporal stability of model parameters the questions have been investigated in two climatically different decades using a large dataset of 213 catchments in austria the snow and runoff model efficiencies have been estimated using a lumped conceptual hydrological model the paper is organized as follows the methodology section describes the hydrological model characterizes the calibration strategy and defines the efficiency measures used the data section provides details about the catchments and data used in the study we then present and discuss the results finally the conclusions and some suggestions for further research are given 2 methodology 2 1 hydrological model the water balance components were simulated by a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model the tuw model viglione and parajka 2014 the tuw model follows the structure of the hbv model bergström 1995 and has already been successfully applied in numerous studies in austria e g parajka et al 2007 merz et al 2011 viglione et al 2013 sleziak et al 2016 2017 2018 and in the rest of europe ceola et al 2015 nijzink et al 2018 the model inputs were the daily precipitation totals mean daily air temperatures and mean daily potential evapotranspiration more details about inputs can be found in section 3 2 the model consists of three routines i e snow soil moisture and runoff routines and has fifteen parameters table 1 the snow routine estimates the accumulation of snow by accumulating all the precipitation if the air temperature is below a certain threshold ts the snow melt is simulated if the air temperature is above the melt threshold tm by using a degree day approach the soil moisture routine estimates changes in the amount of water stored in the soil storage the actual evapotranspiration from the soil storage is estimated from the potential evaporation by a threshold parameter lp that determines the limit above which it is equal to the potential evaporation rate the contribution of the soil storage to the runoff is calculated as a nonlinear function of the soil moisture the runoff routine consists of the simulation of the runoff generation 5 parameters and river routing 2 parameters a list of the calibrated model parameters is given in table 1 and a more detailed description of the model parameters and equations is given in parajka et al 2007 2 2 multiple objective calibration and validation we used an automatic calibration procedure with the deoptim differential evolution algorithm ardia et al 2015 deoptim imitates evolutionary processes i e mutation natural selection and crossing in searching for the best results this algorithm has also been used in previous modelling studies with the model ceola et al 2015 and has been found to be efficient for optimizing the model parameters in this study fifteen model parameters table 1 have been included in the calibration process the range of the parameter values has been specified based on previous experience with the model in the region selected e g merz et al 2011 viglione et al 2013 the model is calibrated by a compound objective

observations and the simulations we tested a range of ws weights i e ws 0 0 0 5 0 75 0 85 0 9 0 97 1 0 which allowed us to describe the trade off between the two objectives if the ws equals 0 0 and 1 0 then the calibration represents a single objective optimisation of the runoff and snow cover only respectively the runoff part of the objective function zq eq 2 combines the nash sutcliffe coefficient me nash and sutcliffe 1970 estimated from the normal eq 3 and logarithmic transformed me log eq 4 daily streamflow values merz et al 2011 2 z q w q 1 m e 1 w q 1 m e log where wq represents the relative weight of the high and low flows respectively the weight wq is set at 0 5 which was selected based on prior analyses performed in different calibration studies in austria see e g parajka and blöschl 2008 merz et al 2011 parajka et al 2016 the two runoff efficiencies i e me and me log were calculated as follows 3 me 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 4 m e log 1 i 1 n log q sim i log q obs i 2 i 1 n log q obs i log q obs 2 where qsim i and qobs i are the simulated and observed mean daily flows of each time step i and q obs is the average of the flows observed the values of me and me log vary between and 1 the snow related objective function zs minimizes the relative number of days with poor snow cover simulations a poor model simulation was considered when model simulates snow i e the simulated catchment average of snow water equivalent indicates snow but it is not observed at the ground i e the catchment average of interpolated snow depth is zero or vice versa similar approach was successfully applied in some previous studies in the study region e g parajka et al 2007 parajka et al 2008 the value of zs is defined as 5 z s i 1 n s e u i 1 n s e o n where s e u is the number of days when the model underestimates the snow cover i e interpolated snow depth indicates snow in the catchment but model does not s e o is the number of days when the model overestimates the snow cover model simulates snow but interpolated snow depth does not and n is the total number of days in the simulation period in order to minimize some numerical artefacts of snow depth interpolation or estimation of snow water equivalent when the estimates of snow are close but not zero the threshold when we considered snow on the ground or snow simulated by the model need to be defined so the snow underestimation error s e u is defined as the number of days when the mean catchment snow depth sd is larger than the threshold ψ sd and the simulated mean catchment snow water equivalent swe is less than the threshold ψ swe 6 sd ψ sd s w e ψ swe similarly the snow overestimation error s e o counts the number of days when the mean interpolated snow depth sd in the catchment is less than the threshold ψ sd and the simulated snow water equivalent swe is larger than the threshold ψ swe 7 sd ψ sd s w e ψ swe the final thresholds ψsd and ψswe in the evaluation were chosen on the basis of the sensitivity analyses performed in section 4 1 the model was calibrated independently for 213 catchments in two different decades i e 1981 1990 and 2001 2010 and the snow and runoff model efficiency was evaluated using the differential split sample test dsst klemeš 1986 parameters calibrated in wetter warmer period were validated in drier colder period and versa vise the warmup period was set to 304 days the modeling was performed using r software r development core team 2011 and an example of the script used for the calibration of the model of one catchment is given in the supplement 2 3 method of testing temporal stability of the hydrological model parameters we evaluated the temporal stability of the hydrological model parameters obtained from the different weightings of the snow in a multiple objective calibration by a comparison of their values calibrated for the colder drier period 1981 1990 with those calibrated for the warmer wetter period 2001 2010 we used the pearson correlation coefficient r 2 as a measure of the temporal stability 3 data 3 1 study region the study region covers 213 catchments in austria fig 1 this region is hydrologically diverse ranging from lowlands in the east and high alpine catchments in the west the area of catchments is between 14 and 6200 km2 the mean catchment elevation varies from 295 m a s l in the lowlands to 2915 m a s l in the austrian alps the mean annual precipitation in the study region ranges from 680 mm year to 2300 mm year the mean annual air temperature in the study region varies between 2 1 and 10 c in the austrian alps the predominant geology is composed of limestone and dolomite in the lowlands the predominant geology classes are tertiary and quaternary sediments the land use in austria is mainly agricultural in the lowlands while alpine vegetation and rocks prevail in the mountains 3 2 hydro meteorological data the time series of the model inputs for each catchment were extracted from daily grid maps of the precipitation air temperature and potential evaporation the grid maps were interpolated from daily measurements of the precipitation and snow depths at 1091 stations and the daily air temperature at 212 climatic stations in the period 1981 2010 the grid maps of the precipitation and snow depths were interpolated by external drift kriging merz et al 2011 the maps of the air temperatures were interpolated by the least squares trend prediction method pebesma 2001 the gridded potential evapotranspiration was calculated by map algebra operations using the modified blaney criddle estimation method parajka et al 2003 2005 a more detailed description of the interpolation procedure is given e g in merz et al 2011 daily runoff data observed at 213 gauged stations were used to calibrate and verify the hydrological model the runoff data was inspected and quality checked in previous modeling studies e g viglione et al 2013 sleziak et al 2016 sleziak et al 2017 2018 the location of the runoff gauges is presented in fig 1 the colors of the symbols indicate the two groups of catchments i e catchments situated in the alpine and flatland regions the groups are delineated according to a sensitivity analysis of the hydrological model performed in sleziak et al 2018 the catchments where the most sensitive model parameters were related to snow melt are delineated as alpine in this study the catchments with the most sensitive model parameters related to soil moisture are delineated as hilly and flatland catchments both groups of catchments have a similar range of catchment sizes i e the areas range from approximately 10 to 6200 km2 and the mean catchment elevation varies from 984 to 2915 m a s l in 71 alpine catchments and from 295 to 1924 m a s l in 142 hilly and flatland catchments fig 2 shows the differences in the climate and runoff characteristics between the groups in the two different decades the most noticeable differences were higher precipitation in the summer and greater snow accumulation in the winter in the alpine catchments which was translated into a much more seasonal runoff regime than in the lowland catchments the main differences between the decades selected were greater precipitation in the summer particularly in the lowland catchments and an increase in the air temperature and decrease in the snow accumulation and earlier melting in the more recent decade 2001 2010 table 2 indicates that monthly mean air temperature increased from 3 2 to 3 8 c for alpine catchments and from 6 9 to 7 4 c for flatland catchments winter temperature difference in mountains is between 2 5 and 1 9 c and in flatlands is between 0 8 and 1 3 c summer temperature difference in mountains is in a range of 9 0 to 9 5 c and in flatlands is in a range of 13 2 to 13 6 c mean precipitation also tends to increase in the more recent decade 2001 2010 these increase is more pronounced in flatland catchments in summer i e summer precipitation difference is between 110 and 123 mm interestingly the differences between the seasonal runoff regimes in the two decades are very small table 2 based on these climatic differences between two studied decades i e 1981 1990 and 2001 2010 we consider the period 1981 1990 as colder drier and the period 2001 2010 as warmer wetter 4 results 4 1 sensitivity of snow errors to the thresholds ψsd and ψswe figs 3 and 4 show the sensitivity of the snow errors to the thresholds above below which the catchment is considered as snow covered snow free i e ψ sd and ψ swe fig 3 shows the snow underestimation errors for fifteen cases a o in the two groups of catchments i e the alpine catchment is represented by blue and the flatlands by red boxes the snow underestimation error occurs if the mean catchment snow depth observed is larger than 0 1 cm a f k cases 1 cm b g l cases 2 cm c h m 5 cm d i n and 10 cm e j o and if the snow simulations of swe are less than 0 1 mm cases a e 0 5 mm cases f j or 1 mm cases k o it is clear that the magnitude and sensitivity of the snow underestimation errors is significantly larger on the flatlands than in the alpine catchments in both groups the snow underestimation tends to decrease with an increasing ψ sd threshold but it is less sensitive to the ψ swe threshold the sensitivity of the snow overestimation error is showed in fig 4 twelve variants a l indicate that if the catchment is considered snow free when the mean catchment snow depth is less than 0 1 cm then this error is insensitive to the large range of the ψ swe threshold the magnitude of the snow overestimation error is noticeably larger in the alpine catchments and for variants e and f the error practically does not occur in the hilly and flatland catchments based on this analysis the thresholds selected for this study are represented by case c for the underestimation snow errors and case d for the overestimation snow errors these thresholds provide a quite realistic descriptions of the physical processes of snow i e swe sd they are also necessary for the validation of snow model efficiency 4 2 impact of the changing snow weight on runoff and snow model efficiency fig 5 presents the runoff model efficiency me for 7 different snow weights ws in the two different decades different colors and two groups of catchments the top and bottom panels in the calibration and validation periods the left and right panels the results for the calibration me show that by increasing the ws from 0 5 to 0 97 the median runoff model efficiency decreases by 12 i e from 0 72 and 0 74 to 0 65 and 0 64 in the alpine catchments and by approximately 15 0 70 and 0 74 to 0 59 and 0 65 in the flatland catchments compared to the calibration to runoff only ws 0 this decrease is somewhat smaller for both groups of catchments in the warmer wetter decade 2001 2010 for the calibration to snow only ws 1 a significant decrease was observed in the median me which was the largest more than 94 in the flatland catchments in the colder drier decade while the change in the median me with ws is similar in both decades in the alpine catchments the calibration me is about 5 to 10 larger in the warmer wetter decade 2001 2010 in the flatland catchments this improvement in the runoff me in the flatland catchments increased with the increasing ws weight so for ws 0 and ws 0 5 the increase is around 5 and for ws 0 9 the median me for the same ws weight is about 10 larger in the warmer than in the colder decade a similar trend with a decrease in the runoff me with an increasing weight ws was observed in the validation periods fig 5 right panels interestingly the drop in the validation me in the alpine catchments is smaller in the colder drier validation period 1981 1990 particularly for the weights between 0 5 and 0 9 to the contrary in the hilly and flatland catchments the drop in the median me is smaller in the warmer wetter decade the difference between the calibration and validation me in the two climatically different decades indicates that the impact of the snow weight is different for the alpine and flatland catchments table 3 in the alpine catchments the drop in median me for ws between 0 5 and 0 9 in the warmer wetter calibration and colder drier validation periods is between 3 1 and 4 7 compared with 5 1 for the single objective optimization to runoff only for the opposite case colder calibration and warmer validation periods the drop is larger i e 10 7 for ws 0 and between 12 3 to 14 1 for the weights between 0 5 and 0 97 interestingly in the flatland catchments the change shows the opposite scenario in the case of the colder drier calibration period and the warmer wetter validation period the difference between the median me of the calibration and validation periods is 0 8 to 4 4 for the ws between 0 75 and 0 97 compared to a drop of 6 3 for the ws 0 for the second case warmer calibration and colder validation periods the drop is between 15 and 19 where for the weights between 0 5 and 0 9 the drop is about 1 2 smaller than in the single objective calibration of the runoff ws 0 the impact of ws on the snow model error zs is presented in figs 6 8 the change in overall zs fig 6 indicates that using the weight ws in the calibration improves the snow cover simulations particularly for ws 0 75 and greater the improvement is similar for the flatland and alpine catchments and exceeds 60 to 73 compared to the zs obtained by calibration to runoff only the exception is the efficiency obtained in the alpine catchments in the warmer wetter decade where the increase in the snow model s efficiency is smaller and is in a range of 19 to 32 the relative improvement of the snow simulations in the validation periods is larger in the flatland catchments and is in a range of 45 to 60 for the ws in a range between 0 75 and 1 in the alpine catchments the relative improvement of the snow cover simulations is smaller and ranges between 13 and 31 although the overall zs is similar in the alpine and flatland catchments fig 6 there are distinct differences in the magnitude of the snow cover error particularly for the calibration to runoff only ws 0 the snow underestimation errors fig 7 are noticeably larger in the flatland catchments but the differences decrease with the increasing snow weight this can be related to higher air temperature in these catchments to compare with alpine catchments see fig 2 in the alpine catchments the snow underestimation errors in the calibration period are essentially insensitive to the change in ws however the underestimation errors in the warmer wetter validation period even increase with the increasing ws on the other hand the snow overestimation errors fig 8 are very small and insensitive to the change in ws in the flatland catchments but dominate in the alpine catchments the largest overestimation errors were found in the colder drier validation period when the model was calibrated in the warmer wetter decade fig 8 top right panel as can be seen from figs 5 8 the interquartile range of the boxplots involving snow weight reduced the predictive uncertainty there is a threshold value ws 0 5 after which increasing snow weight does not bring more improvement in predictive uncertainty as well as median values fig 9 shows the differences between the calibration and validation model efficiencies related to the mean annual air temperature color of symbol and their changes between the decades size of symbol the results show that the greatest increase in air temperature larger symbol size was observed in the alpine basins with a mean annual air temperature around 0 c or lower in these basins the snow errors are the largest in all the ws variants interestingly these are basins which have been impacted by the effect of glaciers basins with a more than 10 glacier coverage are indicated by an open circle symbol the increasing air temperatures are causing an increase in glacier melting in the spring and summer months which is not well captured by the hydrological model 4 3 impact of changing snow weight on the temporal stability of the hydrological model parameters the pearson correlation coefficient for the different snow weights is presented in fig 10 reliably and temporally stable parameters are those where the r 2 is large and they are clustered around the 1 1 line in the scatter plots the results for the snow routine parameters indicate that the temporal stability of the degree day factor the snowfall and rainfall threshold parameters increases with the increasing snow weight an r 2 larger than 0 4 is observed for the snow correction factor for ws 0 calibration to runoff only and ws 0 5 and for the degree day factor for the ws between 0 75 and 0 9 interestingly for the ws 1 calibration to snow only the temporal stability of the model parameters decreases from the soil moisture routine parameters a slight increase in temporal stability with increasing snow weight was found for the parameter determining the limit for potential evaporation the other two parameters the field capacity and nonlinearity parameter have the greatest degree of stability for the runoff calibration only ws 0 the highest r 2 was found for the fast storage coefficient of the runoff generation routine however the change in the stability of the parameters of the runoff generation routine with increasing snow weight is rather small and does not show a consistent direction from the results it seems that model structure dominates the parameter uncertainty rather than snow weight under multi objective calibration frame scatterplots of the selected model parameters and snow weights are presented in figs 11 and 12 fig 11 shows the difference between the model parameters obtained in the two climatically different calibration periods in the alpine catchments the size of the symbol indicates the change in the mean annual air temperature between the warmer wetter and colder drier decades the color of the symbol shows the mean annual air temperature in the colder wetter decade i e the 1981 1990 period the results indicate that the increasing snow weight in the model s calibration increases the spatial variability of the most sensitive snow model parameter i e the degree day factor left panels fig 11 increasing the snow weight in the model s calibration increases the magnitude of the degree day factor particularly for catchments with the greatest change in the mean annual air temperature in the warmer wetter decade the degree day factor for the calibrations with larger snow weight tends to be smaller in the catchments impacted by glaciers which likely compensates for the increased glacier melting from the increased air temperature the model parameters of the soil moisture routine are generally more uncertain and did not change with the changing snow weight a similar pattern was also observed for most of the model parameters of the runoff generation routine the exception is the fast storage coefficient fig 11 which did not change with the increasing snow weight but the increase of snow weight tended to increase the magnitude of the model parameter for the catchments with the greatest air temperature change the temporal stability of the hilly and flatland catchments fig 12 is generally slightly larger than in the alpine catchments in general the changes in air temperatures are smaller and the differences in the spatial variability of the model parameters did not change with the increasing snow weight the temporal stability consistently increased with the increasing snow weight only for the snow model parameters i e the degree day factor and threshold temperatures for determining the snowfall and rainfall 5 discussion and conclusions the objective of this study was to understand the effects of changing snow weight ws in a multiple objective calibration of a hydrological model the tuw model in terms of the runoff and snow model efficiency and the temporal stability of the model parameters the initial study of merz et al 2011 showed that calibrating a conceptual hydrological model in climatically different periods resulted in significant temporal trends in some snow and soil moisture model parameters which could have a significant impact on simulated runoff particularly in future climate projection studies evaluations of the regional variability of the model parameters and their link to climate characteristics showed that these trends represent hydrological changes rather than calibration artifacts one of the most sensitive model parameters found in merz et al 2011 and sleziak et al 2018 was the factor controlling snow melt i e the degree day factor which in recent warmer years has decreased over time our results confirmed this decrease and showed that including snow as an additional objective in the model s calibration helps increase the temporal stability particularly in hilly and flatland catchments in alpine catchments the largest decrease in the degree day factor has been observed in catchments affected by glaciers and with the largest increases in air temperature increasing the snow weight in the model s calibration reduced the snow overestimation errors and increased the regional variability of the degree day factor this is consistent with the findings of he et al 2014 and nester et al 2011 who identified the value of and need for a spatially distributed degree day factor in hydrological models in our study we found also smaller degree day factor values if the model was constrained to runoff only this is consistent with finger et al 2011 who found that degree day factor values constrained by multiple objective way to runoff and snow cover characteristics were larger than constrained to runoff only while in our study multi objective calibration reduced the uncertainty of degree day factor in finger et al 2011 the temperature melt factors were surprisingly better constrained by runoff observations only previous studies such as vaze et al 2010 coron et al 2012 showed different effects from changing climate characteristics such as the air temperatures and precipitation on the runoff model efficiency in austria merz et al 2011 and sleziak et al 2018 demonstrated that a hydrological model calibrated in a colder time period e g 1981 1990 tends to overestimate the runoff in a warmer and wetter decade e g 2001 2010 particularly in flatland basins in the opposite case i e by using model parameters calibrated in a warmer decade in a colder drier decade the hydrological model tends to underestimate the volume of the annual runoff the main controlling factor of such changes was identified in sleziak et al 2018 and explained by the magnitude of the change in precipitation the results of this study showed that the impact of the snow weight on the runoff efficiency in climatically different periods was different for the alpine and flatland catchments in the alpine catchments multiple objective calibration in warmer and validation in colder periods resulted in smaller drop in runoff model efficiency than found for calibration variant to runoff only in the flatland catchments the change showed the opposite scenario the runoff efficiency obtained by multiple objective calibration in colder period resulted in a smaller drop of runoff model efficiency in the warmer validation period compared to calibration variant to runoff only as expected the use of snow data improved the snow model efficiency the improvement depends on the magnitude of snow weight but in general it was larger than the relative improvement found by using the modis snow cover images in parajka and blöschl 2008 the largest improvements were found in the flatland catchments our results showed that involving snow weight reduced the predictive uncertainty and the most robust and accurate model simulations were found for an equal weighting of runoff and snow objectives i e threshold value ws 0 5 similar results are also presented by the results of tuo et al 2018 who tested three calibration approaches the first two were single objective calibration approaches where the swat model parameters were calibrated to discharge only only the third approach where they considered swe information at two spatial scales i e subbasin and elevation band in addition to discharge observations provided a reliable prediction of both river discharge and swe in our study we defined snow model error as relative number of days with poor snow model simulations thus we did not directly compare swe model simulations with the interpolated observed snow depth or with transformed snow depth to swe by using some range of snow densities as suggested e g by pistocchi 2016 such indirect comparison is typically used with satellite snow data e g duethmann et al 2014 udnaes et a 2007 but our results indicate that constraining snow model parameters in conceptual hydrologic models by counting only cases with an evident difference between observed and simulation snow characteristics is an effective alternative particularly when observed snow depth is interpolated over catchment scale in some regions there were periods with small values e g less than 1 cm of mean catchment snow depth or simulated mean catchment swe which were caused by lumping of spatial interpolation during preprocessing of model inputs using the relative number of days with evidently poor snow simulations was in our study more sensitive to different snow weights than using some other criteria such as rmse error or correlation between simulated and observed snow characteristics of course such error measure has some limitations if the maximum snow water storage is of interest in the modelling as it is more sensitive to simulations of snow cover duration our results indicate that the impact of increasing the snow weight on the temporal stability of the model parameters is the greatest in catchments with the greatest change in air temperature which are the regions with the most pronounced changes in their hydrological regimes due to increased glacier melt the most sensitive parameters in terms of the changing snow weight are the degree day factor and threshold temperatures for determining rainfalls and snowfalls this complements the results of the evaluation of the parameter uncertainty in parajka et al 2007 and parajka and blöschl 2008 which found the same snow model parameters to be sensitive in terms of temporal uncertainty there are several limitations of our study to be considered firstly the tuw model used in our study is lumped at the basin scale the snow routine of the model uses a non distributed temperature index based degree day approach while in the nature the snow dynamics i e snow accumulation and melt are highly variable in space and time they are dependent on specific conditions such as land cover radiation etc the use of the thresholds is needed to minimize the impact of numerical artefacts when estimating catchment mean snow depth or simulating snow water equivalent in some catchments these values are very close to zero but if the threshold is zero days with poor snow simulations are larger in the future it could be interesting to evaluate changes in the temporal stability of spatially estimated model parameters related to snowmelt our results indicate that additional snow observations help to reduce the uncertainty connected with changing climate conditions but there are regional differences it will therefore be important to investigate the role of spatially distributed patterns of energy income regional changes in rain or snow frequency and impacts of land cover on changes in snowmelt processes in the future we plan to test new approaches for estimating distributed model parameters that will account for the spatial and temporal variability of snowmelt runoff generation processes author contributions p s performed the computations and wrote the manuscript in consultation with j p

5753,in the current changing climate the importance of temporal stability of hydrological models is increasing the objective of this paper is to assess the effects of the changing weight of snow ws in a multiple objective calibration of a conceptual hydrological model in terms of the temporal stability of runoff and snow model efficiency and hydrologic model parameters the methodology was tested by a lumped conceptual hydrological model the tuw model which was calibrated and validated in 213 austrian catchments in two climatically different decades i e 1981 1990 and 2001 2010 the results indicate that the runoff and snow model efficiencies are almost insensitive to a large range of ws i e from 0 to 0 9 for the runoff and from 0 75 to 1 0 for the snow this relationship is similar in the two different decades however the calibration runoff model efficiency i e nash sutcliffe efficiency was about 5 to 10 greater in flatland catchments in the warmer decade 2001 2010 the main impact of ws on the snow model efficiency is the reduction of snow underestimation errors in the flatland catchments the relative improvement of the snow simulations in the validation periods is greater in the flatland catchments and is in a range of 45 60 compared to 13 and 31 in the alpine catchments the evaluation of the temporal stability indicates that increasing the weight of the snow increases the temporal stability of the degree day factor and the parameters of the snowfall and rainfall thresholds a change in the weight of the snow has the greatest impact on glacerized catchments which were the most sensitive to changes in the mean annual air temperature between the two decades keywords multiple objective calibration tuw model efficiency of model temporal stability of the parameters of the model 1 introduction the accurate estimation of water balance components is necessary for solving many water related scientific and practical problems such as e g operational flood forecasting estimations of the potential of hydropower reservoir management flood risk assessments e g nester et al 2016 farkas et al 2016 the use of conceptual water balance models for such applications is associated with several challenges that include the reduction of uncertainty in the estimation of model parameters and their temporal stability merz et al 2011 these challenges are particularly acute in mountainous alpine regions where data are poor or insufficient and where the heterogeneity and spatial variability of the hydrological characteristics is great parajka and blöschl 2008 previous studies e g beldring 2002 parajka et al 2007 parajka et al 2009 finger et al 2011 finger et al 2015 nijzink et al 2018 inter alia have demonstrated that the multi objective calibration of hydrological models serves as an effective way to improve the consistency of the internal states of hydrological models and allows for a significant reduction in the uncertainty of model parameters different types of ground based or satellite observations of for example groundwater levels madsen 2003 soil moisture parajka et al 2006 parajka et al 2009 water storage lo et al 2010 tian et al 2017 evapotranspiration zhang et al 2017 kunnath poovakka et al 2016 snow cover characteristics parajka and blöschl 2008 sorman et al 2009 duethmann et al 2014 isenstein et al 2015 finger et al 2015 lópez et al 2016 riboust et al 2018 tuo et al 2018 glacier characteristics omani et al 2017 or combinations thereof nijzink et al 2018 have been proven to constrain conceptual hydrological models the results of these studies indicate that while including additional data in a model s calibration improves the accuracy of the internal state variables the efficiency of the runoff model does not significantly decrease this has been particularly observed in mountainous areas where the use of additional snow cover data improves the calibration of hydrological models for example udnaes et al 2007 reported that calibration based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis snow cover in addition to runoff improves the simulation of a snow covered area finger et al 2011 2015 showed that modis snow cover glacier mass balance and hourly discharges improve a runoff model s efficiency similar results have been reported by koboltschnig et al 2008 who showed that combination of hourly discharge snow covered area sca and glacier mass balances has potential for hourly discharge simulation sorman et al 2009 showed that inclusion of sca into model calibration has potential for runoff simulations tuo et al 2018 found that only the set of parameters obtained with multi objective approach i e discharge and swe provided an acceptable prediction of both discharge and swe omani et al 2017 found that that the glacier characteristics i e ela observations equilibrium line altitude of three glaciers with observed discharge data provided acceptable mass balance simulations nijzink et al 2018 in their study demonstrated that the hydrological signatures are better represented when multiple data sources i e soil moisture evaporation total water storage snow accumulation are used parajka and blöschl 2008 demonstrated that modis snow cover data can improve both runoff and snow model simulations in an independent validation period along similar lines duethmann et al 2014 reported that considering satellite derived sca in multi objective strategy data can be a good way to improve hydrological modeling the question is how multiple objective calibration affects the performance of hydrological models if used in climatically different time periods several recent studies have investigated the temporal stability and performance of hydrological models under climate variations e g oudin et al 2006 vaze et al 2010 merz et al 2011 coron et al 2012 fowler et al 2016 sleziak et al 2018 most of these studies found that models applied in different climate periods systematically overestimate or underestimate runoff but the changes are not consistent among the studies for example vaze et al 2010 and coron et al 2012 observed a tendency to overestimate mean runoff when the model parameters transfer from wet to dry periods i e when the calibration period is wetter than the validation period opposite results were presented in sleziak et al 2018 who observed an overestimation of the mean runoff when transferring a hydrological model from a colder and drier period to a wetter and warmer period the contrasting findings likely stem from differences in the climate and physiographic conditions of the study regions as well as from differences in the structure of the hydrological models applied these studies however evaluated the temporal stability of a model s efficiency or the parameters of a hydrological model for models only calibrated for runoff previous studies showed that multiple objective calibration allows a robust calibration of hydrologic models and an improvement of estimation of individual components of water balance however temporal stability of model parameters obtained by multiple objective calibration is still not understood well the main objective of this study is thus to investigate the temporal stability of model efficiency and model parameters obtained by multiple objective calibration to runoff and snow cover over contrasted climatic periods we are particularly interested in two research questions a what impact has the changing snow weight in multiple objective calibration on model performance in different climatic periods b what is the impact of changing snow weight on the temporal stability of model parameters the questions have been investigated in two climatically different decades using a large dataset of 213 catchments in austria the snow and runoff model efficiencies have been estimated using a lumped conceptual hydrological model the paper is organized as follows the methodology section describes the hydrological model characterizes the calibration strategy and defines the efficiency measures used the data section provides details about the catchments and data used in the study we then present and discuss the results finally the conclusions and some suggestions for further research are given 2 methodology 2 1 hydrological model the water balance components were simulated by a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model the tuw model viglione and parajka 2014 the tuw model follows the structure of the hbv model bergström 1995 and has already been successfully applied in numerous studies in austria e g parajka et al 2007 merz et al 2011 viglione et al 2013 sleziak et al 2016 2017 2018 and in the rest of europe ceola et al 2015 nijzink et al 2018 the model inputs were the daily precipitation totals mean daily air temperatures and mean daily potential evapotranspiration more details about inputs can be found in section 3 2 the model consists of three routines i e snow soil moisture and runoff routines and has fifteen parameters table 1 the snow routine estimates the accumulation of snow by accumulating all the precipitation if the air temperature is below a certain threshold ts the snow melt is simulated if the air temperature is above the melt threshold tm by using a degree day approach the soil moisture routine estimates changes in the amount of water stored in the soil storage the actual evapotranspiration from the soil storage is estimated from the potential evaporation by a threshold parameter lp that determines the limit above which it is equal to the potential evaporation rate the contribution of the soil storage to the runoff is calculated as a nonlinear function of the soil moisture the runoff routine consists of the simulation of the runoff generation 5 parameters and river routing 2 parameters a list of the calibrated model parameters is given in table 1 and a more detailed description of the model parameters and equations is given in parajka et al 2007 2 2 multiple objective calibration and validation we used an automatic calibration procedure with the deoptim differential evolution algorithm ardia et al 2015 deoptim imitates evolutionary processes i e mutation natural selection and crossing in searching for the best results this algorithm has also been used in previous modelling studies with the model ceola et al 2015 and has been found to be efficient for optimizing the model parameters in this study fifteen model parameters table 1 have been included in the calibration process the range of the parameter values has been specified based on previous experience with the model in the region selected e g merz et al 2011 viglione et al 2013 the model is calibrated by a compound objective function zc eq 1 it consists of the runoff zq and snow cover zs parts and is defined as 1 z c w s z s 1 w s z q where ws represents the weight given to the agreement between the snow cover observations and the simulations we tested a range of ws weights i e ws 0 0 0 5 0 75 0 85 0 9 0 97 1 0 which allowed us to describe the trade off between the two objectives if the ws equals 0 0 and 1 0 then the calibration represents a single objective optimisation of the runoff and snow cover only respectively the runoff part of the objective function zq eq 2 combines the nash sutcliffe coefficient me nash and sutcliffe 1970 estimated from the normal eq 3 and logarithmic transformed me log eq 4 daily streamflow values merz et al 2011 2 z q w q 1 m e 1 w q 1 m e log where wq represents the relative weight of the high and low flows respectively the weight wq is set at 0 5 which was selected based on prior analyses performed in different calibration studies in austria see e g parajka and blöschl 2008 merz et al 2011 parajka et al 2016 the two runoff efficiencies i e me and me log were calculated as follows 3 me 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 4 m e log 1 i 1 n log q sim i log q obs i 2 i 1 n log q obs i log q obs 2 where qsim i and qobs i are the simulated and observed mean daily flows of each time step i and q obs is the average of the flows observed the values of me and me log vary between and 1 the snow related objective function zs minimizes the relative number of days with poor snow cover simulations a poor model simulation was considered when model simulates snow i e the simulated catchment average of snow water equivalent indicates snow but it is not observed at the ground i e the catchment average of interpolated snow depth is zero or vice versa similar approach was successfully applied in some previous studies in the study region e g parajka et al 2007 parajka et al 2008 the value of zs is defined as 5 z s i 1 n s e u i 1 n s e o n where s e u is the number of days when the model underestimates the snow cover i e interpolated snow depth indicates snow in the catchment but model does not s e o is the number of days when the model overestimates the snow cover model simulates snow but interpolated snow depth does not and n is the total number of days in the simulation period in order to minimize some numerical artefacts of snow depth interpolation or estimation of snow water equivalent when the estimates of snow are close but not zero the threshold when we considered snow on the ground or snow simulated by the model need to be defined so the snow underestimation error s e u is defined as the number of days when the mean catchment snow depth sd is larger than the threshold ψ sd and the simulated mean catchment snow water equivalent swe is less than the threshold ψ swe 6 sd ψ sd s w e ψ swe similarly the snow overestimation error s e o counts the number of days when the mean interpolated snow depth sd in the catchment is less than the threshold ψ sd and the simulated snow water equivalent swe is larger than the threshold ψ swe 7 sd ψ sd s w e ψ swe the final thresholds ψsd and ψswe in the evaluation were chosen on the basis of the sensitivity analyses performed in section 4 1 the model was calibrated independently for 213 catchments in two different decades i e 1981 1990 and 2001 2010 and the snow and runoff model efficiency was evaluated using the differential split sample test dsst klemeš 1986 parameters calibrated in wetter warmer period were validated in drier colder period and versa vise the warmup period was set to 304 days the modeling was performed using r software r development core team 2011 and an example of the script used for the calibration of the model of one catchment is given in the supplement 2 3 method of testing temporal stability of the hydrological model parameters we evaluated the temporal stability of the hydrological model parameters obtained from the different weightings of the snow in a multiple objective calibration by a comparison of their values calibrated for the colder drier period 1981 1990 with those calibrated for the warmer wetter period 2001 2010 we used the pearson correlation coefficient r 2 as a measure of the temporal stability 3 data 3 1 study region the study region covers 213 catchments in austria fig 1 this region is hydrologically diverse ranging from lowlands in the east and high alpine catchments in the west the area of catchments is between 14 and 6200 km2 the mean catchment elevation varies from 295 m a s l in the lowlands to 2915 m a s l in the austrian alps the mean annual precipitation in the study region ranges from 680 mm year to 2300 mm year the mean annual air temperature in the study region varies between 2 1 and 10 c in the austrian alps the predominant geology is composed of limestone and dolomite in the lowlands the predominant geology classes are tertiary and quaternary sediments the land use in austria is mainly agricultural in the lowlands while alpine vegetation and rocks prevail in the mountains 3 2 hydro meteorological data the time series of the model inputs for each catchment were extracted from daily grid maps of the precipitation air temperature and potential evaporation the grid maps were interpolated from daily measurements of the precipitation and snow depths at 1091 stations and the daily air temperature at 212 climatic stations in the period 1981 2010 the grid maps of the precipitation and snow depths were interpolated by external drift kriging merz et al 2011 the maps of the air temperatures were interpolated by the least squares trend prediction method pebesma 2001 the gridded potential evapotranspiration was calculated by map algebra operations using the modified blaney criddle estimation method parajka et al 2003 2005 a more detailed description of the interpolation procedure is given e g in merz et al 2011 daily runoff data observed at 213 gauged stations were used to calibrate and verify the hydrological model the runoff data was inspected and quality checked in previous modeling studies e g viglione et al 2013 sleziak et al 2016 sleziak et al 2017 2018 the location of the runoff gauges is presented in fig 1 the colors of the symbols indicate the two groups of catchments i e catchments situated in the alpine and flatland regions the groups are delineated according to a sensitivity analysis of the hydrological model performed in sleziak et al 2018 the catchments where the most sensitive model parameters were related to snow melt are delineated as alpine in this study the catchments with the most sensitive model parameters related to soil moisture are delineated as hilly and flatland catchments both groups of catchments have a similar range of catchment sizes i e the areas range from approximately 10 to 6200 km2 and the mean catchment elevation varies from 984 to 2915 m a s l in 71 alpine catchments and from 295 to 1924 m a s l in 142 hilly and flatland catchments fig 2 shows the differences in the climate and runoff characteristics between the groups in the two different decades the most noticeable differences were higher precipitation in the summer and greater snow accumulation in the winter in the alpine catchments which was translated into a much more seasonal runoff regime than in the lowland catchments the main differences between the decades selected were greater precipitation in the summer particularly in the lowland catchments and an increase in the air temperature and decrease in the snow accumulation and earlier melting in the more recent decade 2001 2010 table 2 indicates that monthly mean air temperature increased from 3 2 to 3 8 c for alpine catchments and from 6 9 to 7 4 c for flatland catchments winter temperature difference in mountains is between 2 5 and 1 9 c and in flatlands is between 0 8 and 1 3 c summer temperature difference in mountains is in a range of 9 0 to 9 5 c and in flatlands is in a range of 13 2 to 13 6 c mean precipitation also tends to increase in the more recent decade 2001 2010 these increase is more pronounced in flatland catchments in summer i e summer precipitation difference is between 110 and 123 mm interestingly the differences between the seasonal runoff regimes in the two decades are very small table 2 based on these climatic differences between two studied decades i e 1981 1990 and 2001 2010 we consider the period 1981 1990 as colder drier and the period 2001 2010 as warmer wetter 4 results 4 1 sensitivity of snow errors to the thresholds ψsd and ψswe figs 3 and 4 show the sensitivity of the snow errors to the thresholds above below which the catchment is considered as snow covered snow free i e ψ sd and ψ swe fig 3 shows the snow underestimation errors for fifteen cases a o in the two groups of catchments i e the alpine catchment is represented by blue and the flatlands by red boxes the snow underestimation error occurs if the mean catchment snow depth observed is larger than 0 1 cm a f k cases 1 cm b g l cases 2 cm c h m 5 cm d i n and 10 cm e j o and if the snow simulations of swe are less than 0 1 mm cases a e 0 5 mm cases f j or 1 mm cases k o it is clear that the magnitude and sensitivity of the snow underestimation errors is significantly larger on the flatlands than in the alpine catchments in both groups the snow underestimation tends to decrease with an increasing ψ sd threshold but it is less sensitive to the ψ swe threshold the sensitivity of the snow overestimation error is showed in fig 4 twelve variants a l indicate that if the catchment is considered snow free when the mean catchment snow depth is less than 0 1 cm then this error is insensitive to the large range of the ψ swe threshold the magnitude of the snow overestimation error is noticeably larger in the alpine catchments and for variants e and f the error practically does not occur in the hilly and flatland catchments based on this analysis the thresholds selected for this study are represented by case c for the underestimation snow errors and case d for the overestimation snow errors these thresholds provide a quite realistic descriptions of the physical processes of snow i e swe sd they are also necessary for the validation of snow model efficiency 4 2 impact of the changing snow weight on runoff and snow model efficiency fig 5 presents the runoff model efficiency me for 7 different snow weights ws in the two different decades different colors and two groups of catchments the top and bottom panels in the calibration and validation periods the left and right panels the results for the calibration me show that by increasing the ws from 0 5 to 0 97 the median runoff model efficiency decreases by 12 i e from 0 72 and 0 74 to 0 65 and 0 64 in the alpine catchments and by approximately 15 0 70 and 0 74 to 0 59 and 0 65 in the flatland catchments compared to the calibration to runoff only ws 0 this decrease is somewhat smaller for both groups of catchments in the warmer wetter decade 2001 2010 for the calibration to snow only ws 1 a significant decrease was observed in the median me which was the largest more than 94 in the flatland catchments in the colder drier decade while the change in the median me with ws is similar in both decades in the alpine catchments the calibration me is about 5 to 10 larger in the warmer wetter decade 2001 2010 in the flatland catchments this improvement in the runoff me in the flatland catchments increased with the increasing ws weight so for ws 0 and ws 0 5 the increase is around 5 and for ws 0 9 the median me for the same ws weight is about 10 larger in the warmer than in the colder decade a similar trend with a decrease in the runoff me with an increasing weight ws was observed in the validation periods fig 5 right panels interestingly the drop in the validation me in the alpine catchments is smaller in the colder drier validation period 1981 1990 particularly for the weights between 0 5 and 0 9 to the contrary in the hilly and flatland catchments the drop in the median me is smaller in the warmer wetter decade the difference between the calibration and validation me in the two climatically different decades indicates that the impact of the snow weight is different for the alpine and flatland catchments table 3 in the alpine catchments the drop in median me for ws between 0 5 and 0 9 in the warmer wetter calibration and colder drier validation periods is between 3 1 and 4 7 compared with 5 1 for the single objective optimization to runoff only for the opposite case colder calibration and warmer validation periods the drop is larger i e 10 7 for ws 0 and between 12 3 to 14 1 for the weights between 0 5 and 0 97 interestingly in the flatland catchments the change shows the opposite scenario in the case of the colder drier calibration period and the warmer wetter validation period the difference between the median me of the calibration and validation periods is 0 8 to 4 4 for the ws between 0 75 and 0 97 compared to a drop of 6 3 for the ws 0 for the second case warmer calibration and colder validation periods the drop is between 15 and 19 where for the weights between 0 5 and 0 9 the drop is about 1 2 smaller than in the single objective calibration of the runoff ws 0 the impact of ws on the snow model error zs is presented in figs 6 8 the change in overall zs fig 6 indicates that using the weight ws in the calibration improves the snow cover simulations particularly for ws 0 75 and greater the improvement is similar for the flatland and alpine catchments and exceeds 60 to 73 compared to the zs obtained by calibration to runoff only the exception is the efficiency obtained in the alpine catchments in the warmer wetter decade where the increase in the snow model s efficiency is smaller and is in a range of 19 to 32 the relative improvement of the snow simulations in the validation periods is larger in the flatland catchments and is in a range of 45 to 60 for the ws in a range between 0 75 and 1 in the alpine catchments the relative improvement of the snow cover simulations is smaller and ranges between 13 and 31 although the overall zs is similar in the alpine and flatland catchments fig 6 there are distinct differences in the magnitude of the snow cover error particularly for the calibration to runoff only ws 0 the snow underestimation errors fig 7 are noticeably larger in the flatland catchments but the differences decrease with the increasing snow weight this can be related to higher air temperature in these catchments to compare with alpine catchments see fig 2 in the alpine catchments the snow underestimation errors in the calibration period are essentially insensitive to the change in ws however the underestimation errors in the warmer wetter validation period even increase with the increasing ws on the other hand the snow overestimation errors fig 8 are very small and insensitive to the change in ws in the flatland catchments but dominate in the alpine catchments the largest overestimation errors were found in the colder drier validation period when the model was calibrated in the warmer wetter decade fig 8 top right panel as can be seen from figs 5 8 the interquartile range of the boxplots involving snow weight reduced the predictive uncertainty there is a threshold value ws 0 5 after which increasing snow weight does not bring more improvement in predictive uncertainty as well as median values fig 9 shows the differences between the calibration and validation model efficiencies related to the mean annual air temperature color of symbol and their changes between the decades size of symbol the results show that the greatest increase in air temperature larger symbol size was observed in the alpine basins with a mean annual air temperature around 0 c or lower in these basins the snow errors are the largest in all the ws variants interestingly these are basins which have been impacted by the effect of glaciers basins with a more than 10 glacier coverage are indicated by an open circle symbol the increasing air temperatures are causing an increase in glacier melting in the spring and summer months which is not well captured by the hydrological model 4 3 impact of changing snow weight on the temporal stability of the hydrological model parameters the pearson correlation coefficient for the different snow weights is presented in fig 10 reliably and temporally stable parameters are those where the r 2 is large and they are clustered around the 1 1 line in the scatter plots the results for the snow routine parameters indicate that the temporal stability of the degree day factor the snowfall and rainfall threshold parameters increases with the increasing snow weight an r 2 larger than 0 4 is observed for the snow correction factor for ws 0 calibration to runoff only and ws 0 5 and for the degree day factor for the ws between 0 75 and 0 9 interestingly for the ws 1 calibration to snow only the temporal stability of the model parameters decreases from the soil moisture routine parameters a slight increase in temporal stability with increasing snow weight was found for the parameter determining the limit for potential evaporation the other two parameters the field capacity and nonlinearity parameter have the greatest degree of stability for the runoff calibration only ws 0 the highest r 2 was found for the fast storage coefficient of the runoff generation routine however the change in the stability of the parameters of the runoff generation routine with increasing snow weight is rather small and does not show a consistent direction from the results it seems that model structure dominates the parameter uncertainty rather than snow weight under multi objective calibration frame scatterplots of the selected model parameters and snow weights are presented in figs 11 and 12 fig 11 shows the difference between the model parameters obtained in the two climatically different calibration periods in the alpine catchments the size of the symbol indicates the change in the mean annual air temperature between the warmer wetter and colder drier decades the color of the symbol shows the mean annual air temperature in the colder wetter decade i e the 1981 1990 period the results indicate that the increasing snow weight in the model s calibration increases the spatial variability of the most sensitive snow model parameter i e the degree day factor left panels fig 11 increasing the snow weight in the model s calibration increases the magnitude of the degree day factor particularly for catchments with the greatest change in the mean annual air temperature in the warmer wetter decade the degree day factor for the calibrations with larger snow weight tends to be smaller in the catchments impacted by glaciers which likely compensates for the increased glacier melting from the increased air temperature the model parameters of the soil moisture routine are generally more uncertain and did not change with the changing snow weight a similar pattern was also observed for most of the model parameters of the runoff generation routine the exception is the fast storage coefficient fig 11 which did not change with the increasing snow weight but the increase of snow weight tended to increase the magnitude of the model parameter for the catchments with the greatest air temperature change the temporal stability of the hilly and flatland catchments fig 12 is generally slightly larger than in the alpine catchments in general the changes in air temperatures are smaller and the differences in the spatial variability of the model parameters did not change with the increasing snow weight the temporal stability consistently increased with the increasing snow weight only for the snow model parameters i e the degree day factor and threshold temperatures for determining the snowfall and rainfall 5 discussion and conclusions the objective of this study was to understand the effects of changing snow weight ws in a multiple objective calibration of a hydrological model the tuw model in terms of the runoff and snow model efficiency and the temporal stability of the model parameters the initial study of merz et al 2011 showed that calibrating a conceptual hydrological model in climatically different periods resulted in significant temporal trends in some snow and soil moisture model parameters which could have a significant impact on simulated runoff particularly in future climate projection studies evaluations of the regional variability of the model parameters and their link to climate characteristics showed that these trends represent hydrological changes rather than calibration artifacts one of the most sensitive model parameters found in merz et al 2011 and sleziak et al 2018 was the factor controlling snow melt i e the degree day factor which in recent warmer years has decreased over time our results confirmed this decrease and showed that including snow as an additional objective in the model s calibration helps increase the temporal stability particularly in hilly and flatland catchments in alpine catchments the largest decrease in the degree day factor has been observed in catchments affected by glaciers and with the largest increases in air temperature increasing the snow weight in the model s calibration reduced the snow overestimation errors and increased the regional variability of the degree day factor this is consistent with the findings of he et al 2014 and nester et al 2011 who identified the value of and need for a spatially distributed degree day factor in hydrological models in our study we found also smaller degree day factor values if the model was constrained to runoff only this is consistent with finger et al 2011 who found that degree day factor values constrained by multiple objective way to runoff and snow cover characteristics were larger than constrained to runoff only while in our study multi objective calibration reduced the uncertainty of degree day factor in finger et al 2011 the temperature melt factors were surprisingly better constrained by runoff observations only previous studies such as vaze et al 2010 coron et al 2012 showed different effects from changing climate characteristics such as the air temperatures and precipitation on the runoff model efficiency in austria merz et al 2011 and sleziak et al 2018 demonstrated that a hydrological model calibrated in a colder time period e g 1981 1990 tends to overestimate the runoff in a warmer and wetter decade e g 2001 2010 particularly in flatland basins in the opposite case i e by using model parameters calibrated in a warmer decade in a colder drier decade the hydrological model tends to underestimate the volume of the annual runoff the main controlling factor of such changes was identified in sleziak et al 2018 and explained by the magnitude of the change in precipitation the results of this study showed that the impact of the snow weight on the runoff efficiency in climatically different periods was different for the alpine and flatland catchments in the alpine catchments multiple objective calibration in warmer and validation in colder periods resulted in smaller drop in runoff model efficiency than found for calibration variant to runoff only in the flatland catchments the change showed the opposite scenario the runoff efficiency obtained by multiple objective calibration in colder period resulted in a smaller drop of runoff model efficiency in the warmer validation period compared to calibration variant to runoff only as expected the use of snow data improved the snow model efficiency the improvement depends on the magnitude of snow weight but in general it was larger than the relative improvement found by using the modis snow cover images in parajka and blöschl 2008 the largest improvements were found in the flatland catchments our results showed that involving snow weight reduced the predictive uncertainty and the most robust and accurate model simulations were found for an equal weighting of runoff and snow objectives i e threshold value ws 0 5 similar results are also presented by the results of tuo et al 2018 who tested three calibration approaches the first two were single objective calibration approaches where the swat model parameters were calibrated to discharge only only the third approach where they considered swe information at two spatial scales i e subbasin and elevation band in addition to discharge observations provided a reliable prediction of both river discharge and swe in our study we defined snow model error as relative number of days with poor snow model simulations thus we did not directly compare swe model simulations with the interpolated observed snow depth or with transformed snow depth to swe by using some range of snow densities as suggested e g by pistocchi 2016 such indirect comparison is typically used with satellite snow data e g duethmann et al 2014 udnaes et a 2007 but our results indicate that constraining snow model parameters in conceptual hydrologic models by counting only cases with an evident difference between observed and simulation snow characteristics is an effective alternative particularly when observed snow depth is interpolated over catchment scale in some regions there were periods with small values e g less than 1 cm of mean catchment snow depth or simulated mean catchment swe which were caused by lumping of spatial interpolation during preprocessing of model inputs using the relative number of days with evidently poor snow simulations was in our study more sensitive to different snow weights than using some other criteria such as rmse error or correlation between simulated and observed snow characteristics of course such error measure has some limitations if the maximum snow water storage is of interest in the modelling as it is more sensitive to simulations of snow cover duration our results indicate that the impact of increasing the snow weight on the temporal stability of the model parameters is the greatest in catchments with the greatest change in air temperature which are the regions with the most pronounced changes in their hydrological regimes due to increased glacier melt the most sensitive parameters in terms of the changing snow weight are the degree day factor and threshold temperatures for determining rainfalls and snowfalls this complements the results of the evaluation of the parameter uncertainty in parajka et al 2007 and parajka and blöschl 2008 which found the same snow model parameters to be sensitive in terms of temporal uncertainty there are several limitations of our study to be considered firstly the tuw model used in our study is lumped at the basin scale the snow routine of the model uses a non distributed temperature index based degree day approach while in the nature the snow dynamics i e snow accumulation and melt are highly variable in space and time they are dependent on specific conditions such as land cover radiation etc the use of the thresholds is needed to minimize the impact of numerical artefacts when estimating catchment mean snow depth or simulating snow water equivalent in some catchments these values are very close to zero but if the threshold is zero days with poor snow simulations are larger in the future it could be interesting to evaluate changes in the temporal stability of spatially estimated model parameters related to snowmelt our results indicate that additional snow observations help to reduce the uncertainty connected with changing climate conditions but there are regional differences it will therefore be important to investigate the role of spatially distributed patterns of energy income regional changes in rain or snow frequency and impacts of land cover on changes in snowmelt processes in the future we plan to test new approaches for estimating distributed model parameters that will account for the spatial and temporal variability of snowmelt runoff generation processes author contributions p s performed the computations and wrote the manuscript in consultation with j p

5754,submarine groundwater discharge sgd is considered as a good indicator of the natural behavior of coastal aquifers especially in the case of intense groundwater withdrawal or when the aquifer recharge conditions are limited indeed a decrease in sgd flows would result in saline intrusion compromising the groundwater reservoir use the need for sgd studies in mediterranean and semi arid environments have long been recognized and little is known on low and diffuse flows for this reason the detection and quantification of low and diffuse sgd flows have been attempted in a mediterranean porous aquifer with low potential of recharge and high touristic pressure from using a multi tracing approach combining aerial thermal infrared images tir temperature t electric conductivity e c major ions selected trace elements 2h 18o 222rn 223ra and 224ra the tir images allowed the detection of slight temperature variations at the seawater surface contrasted lithology and strong water rock

activities evidenced sgd flows in agreement with the known flow conditions within the aquifer the quantification of sgd flows revealed in very good agreement with the known recharge rates of the aquifer that validates its conceptual hydrogeological model for the first time in the mediterranean or in semi arid context a natural tracing experiment based on geochemistry and isotope hydrology tools allowed the quantification of sgd flows to validate the hydrogeological conceptual model and to solve the water balance at the whole aquifer scale such a methodology could be applied worldwide to other similar coastal aquifers with low and diffuse sgd flow conditions keywords diffused sgd flows low recharge tir imagery radon radium aquifer water balance 1 introduction to ensure sustainable management of groundwater resources it is necessary to rely on detailed conceptual hydrogeological models this includes the quantification of all water balance terms at the aquifer scale for coastal aquifers an important water balance term is the submarine groundwater discharge sgd burnett et al 2006 baudron et al 2015 the aquifer recharge areas contributing to sgd flows being frequently densely populated sgd flows are then recognized to be a source of nutrients contaminants and pollutants that may affect the coastal hydrosystems functioning kaleris 2006 tomasky holmes et al 2013 rodellas et al 2015 furthermore the amount of fresh sgd flows can reduce or even disappear due to over pumping causing seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers compromising the groundwater reservoir use moujabber et al 2006 mahlknecht et al 2017 nlend et al 2018 the issue of seawater intrusion is obviously stronger for coastal aquifers displaying large interface with the sea that can be worsened by pumping rates mccoy and corbett 2009 mahlknecht et al 2017 and or by increasing climate change effects such as seawater rise sherif and singh 1999 barlow and reichard 2009 werner et al 2013 or modifications in aquifer recharge conditions governing groundwater levels holding et al 2016 meixner et al 2016 santoni et al 2018 bokuniewicz et al 2003 propose a typology for coastal groundwater and provides order of magnitude for sgd flows rates in porous media from various location and climate conditions highlighting very low values around 1 2 l day linear meter in arid regions such coastal aquifers displaying low sgd flows are then more vulnerable to saline intrusion due to the precarious balance between freshwater and seawater of the salt wedge dependant of climate change coastal drainage geometry and groundwater withdrawal for coastal population irrigation and industrial activities the presence of sgd flows is consequently considered as a good indicator of the natural behavior of aquifers sawyer et al 2017 coastal aquifers of the mediterranean area are known to be particularly vulnerable facing climate and anthropogenic pressures so much so saline intrusions are already common richts et al 2011 pachauri et al 2014 destouni and prieto 2003 made a numerical modelling of whole aquifer water balance terms including sgd flows in a selection of porous aquifers in israel greece and cyprus for several management conditions later mazi et al 2014 2016 used an analytical approach to optimize groundwater exploitation conditions in a selection of porous aquifers located in the nile delta israel and cyprus based on water balance components quantification at the whole aquifer scale too they also define the concept of sustainable management space to prevent any major seawater intrusion in addition to numerical modelling and analytical solutions experimental methodologies have been developed to study sgd flows tir imagery can be used to localize them based on the detection of warm or cold groundwater inputs into the sea with a contrasted temperature rapaglia et al 2015 tamborski et al 2015 this technique has been employed worldwide and may be combined with in situ measurements of t e c and or geochemical tracers including natural radioactive isotopes particularly radon and radium isotopes mulligan and charette 2009 mejías et al 2012 povinec et al 2012 lee 2014 rapaglia et al 2015 tamborski et al 2015 these radionuclides are produced in the aquifer or poral waters of the sediment by the decay chain of uranium and thorium within the aquifer rocks and sediments and are released in coastal waters by advection or diffusion making them useful tracers of sgd flows moore 2000 burnett et al 2006 beck et al 2010 radium isotopes are indeed relevant tools thanks to their wide range of half lives from 3 63 days for 224ra to 1600 years for 226ra they can also be used to describe sgd processes in discriminating freshwater inputs from rivers or aquifers with those of recirculated seawater moore 1996 povinec et al 2006 stieglitz et al 2010 bejannin et al 2017 in the current literature sgd flows are widely investigated through experimental methodologies in mainly large diffuse or channelized flows provided by karst fractured or porous aquifers burnett et al 2003 2006 lamontagne et al 2008 povinec et al 2008 mejías et al 2012 santos et al 2012 post et al 2013 montiel et al 2018 however to our knowledge experimental methodologies have never been used to quantify diffuse sgd flows necessary to solve the water balance at the whole aquifer scale in mediterranean and semi arid areas an experimental multi tracing approach combining tir imagery t e c major ions selected trace elements 2h 18o 222rn 223ra and 224ra was attempted on the well documented mediterranean coastal aquifer of bonifacio corsica island france even if no major seawater intrusion is yet detected the bonifacio aquifer is highly vulnerable facing seawater intrusion because more than a half of its boundaries conditions are the mediterranean sea santoni 2016 in addition the equilibrium between groundwater and seawater is fragile since sgd flows are expected to be low due to limited recharge conditions typical of the mediterranean area stigter et al 2012 ghiglieri et al 2014 previous studies already demonstrated its low potential of recharge chesnaux et al 2018 santoni et al 2018 and highlighted its porous matrix composition orsini et al 2010 reynaud et al 2012 as a consequence the bonifacio coastal aquifer is an ideal study site to evaluate the potential of tir geochemical and isotope tools to detect and quantify low and diffuse sgd flow conditions for this aquifer recharge and groundwater withdrawal rates being already known the sgd flows quantification is intended to validate its conceptual hydrogeological model as well as to solve the water balance at the whole aquifer scale 2 study site the bonifacio aquifer corsica island france is part of a coastal plateau located in the western mediterranean fig 1 the study site is under a typical mediterranean climate with mean annual precipitation and temperature about 605 mm and 16 8 c respectively calculated from 01 2000 to 01 2012 at the bonifacio meteo france station the sector of bonifacio is known for its wind blowing up to 300 days per year often with gusts above 60 80 km h especially in the extreme south of the plateau the bonifacio plateau is constrained in equal proportions by the mediterranean sea at the south and northeast and by granites on east and west its shape is triangular and it extends over only 25 km2 with a mean elevation of 80 m asl it is made of miocene sediments filling a fractured hercynian granitic depression up to 270 m deep continuing in the surface at an altitude of 243 m at the monte corbu west and of 113 m at the punta di san mulari rossi and cocherie 1991 orsini et al 2010 the 3000 inhabitants of the bonifacio city reside mainly along the st julien and the st jean valleys and also around the harbour all the bonifacio municipality coastlines constitute a natural marine reserve of national importance many campgrounds and villas spread all over the plateau are crowded during the summer due to tourism activities equivalent to 1 8 million people each year the hydrogeology of the bonifacio plateau consists of two aquifer levels separated by an aquitard santoni 2016 the two aquifers levels are mainly found in the bonifacio and balistra geologic formations reynaud et al 2012 forming an upper and a lower aquifer level respectively they are separated by an aquitard corresponding to a silty layer of the cala di labra geologic formation both aquifer levels are composed of sandy calcarenites and calcareous sandstones representing a very compacted material with a cemented granular structure whose effective porosity is on average 7 dörfliger et al 2002 chesnaux et al 2018 potentiometric levels and geochemical tracers highlighted a recharge area on the plateau autochthonous recharge and another within the surrounding fractured granitic massifs allochthonous recharge from which two main flow lines are identified in direction of the bonifacio harbour and of the sant amanza bay fig 1 the canali river is the only permanent river and it has very low flow it takes its source at the west within granitic massifs before flowing on the plateau and draining the upper aquifer until the sant amanza bay santoni 2016 the carbonate plateau of bonifacio is in continuity with the large miocene sedimentary basin developing between corsica and sardinia islands the sedimentary deposits of the bonifacio plateau are conditioned by the granitic substratum and the thickness of the sediments is a function of the palaeo morphology of this one since no karst morphology is observed and considering the porous matrix of the aquifer the sgd flows are expected to reach the sea very close to the shorelines and according to the salt wedge position fig 1 the groundwater residence time was estimated from dissolved anthropogenic gases cfcs and sf6 concentrations in groundwater santoni et al 2016b weighted ages range from 0 to 50 years in the upper aquifer and from 35 to 60 years in the lower aquifer implying a low dynamic of renewal and a long residence time amplifying water rock interactions an approach using 87sr 86sr validated groundwater flow pattern and residence time by computing water rocks interaction kinetics and mixing rates between the granites the upper and the lower aquifer santoni et al 2016a recently chesnaux et al 2018 and santoni et al 2018 highlighted favourable aquifer recharge rates about respectively 23 and 26 of annual rainfall that suggests the presence of low but detectable sgd flows near the coastal shores 3 method the investigation strategy consisted in three main steps i the acquisition of airborne tir images of the coastlines on the 9th september 2011 to detect sgd flows ii the measurement of physicochemical parameters short half lives radionuclides 222rn 223ra 224ra major ions trace elements and stable isotopes of the water molecule in one stream and nine groundwater samples fig 1 on the 27th 28th and 30th october 2012 a fixed measurement for 222rn in position a in the harbour was also made iii the measurement of temperature e c 222rn 223ra and 224ra in seashores to validate and refine the sgd flows localisation and also to try their quantification on the 8th 9th and 10th january 2014 the objective of the groundwater and river sampling was to identify the main hydrochemical features to ensure the presence of sufficient radon and radium activities in groundwater to detect sgd flows later in the sea 3 1 thermal infrared imagery tir images were acquired along the carbonated rocks shores on the 09th september 2011 using a flir thermal system b20hsv this period was chosen to provide the best thermal contrast between groundwater and seawater the flight acquisition of airborne tir images was performed by the service provider company l avion jaune the flight was conducted at 2200 m altitude from 10 30 am to 11 00 am without any cloud and during low wind 7 8 m s ese direction at the meteo france weather station of bonifacio pertusatu the atmospheric temperature during the flight was 24 2 c and no significant rain event was observed during the last 6 days the tir camera wave length range from 7 5 to 14 µm with 16 384 grey levels set on a temperature palette between 40 to 150 c with an accuracy of 1 c at 2200 m altitude the pixel field of view is about 2 0 2 0 m 3 2 geochemistry and stable isotopes of the water molecule e c and t were directly measured in the field using a wtw cond 3310 wtw gmbh weilheim germany bicarbonates were also determined in the field with a hach digital titrator hach company loveland usa major ions samples were filtrated through 0 45 mm nitrocellulose membranes in two 50 ml polyethylene bottles before storage at 4 c one bottle was acidified using ultrapure nitric acid for cation analysis a dionex ics 1100 chromatograph thermo fischer scientific waltham usa was used to determine ionic concentrations at the emmah laboratory of the university of avignon france the analysis quality was validated for ionic balance error of less than 5 samples for trace elements were filtered through 0 20 µm nitrocellulose membranes and acidified with ultrapure nitric acid in 50 ml polyethylene bottles before storage at 4 c a thermo fisher q icp ms x series ii was used to determine trace elements concentrations at the aete technical platform of the university of montpellier france samples for the analysis of stable isotopes of the water molecule were collected in 20 ml amber glass bottles with no head space a liquid water stable isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research san jose usa was used in accordance with the analytical scheme recommended by the international atomic energy agency penna et al 2010 at the emmah laboratory of the university of avignon france the analysis quality was checked with standard deviation conditions up to 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h 3 3 222rn 223ra and 224ra activities measurements the 222rn activity was measured in groundwater and in seawater along the coastlines and within the bonifacio harbour in six fixed positions by using a rad7 radon monitor combined with a radaqua water exchanger durridge co inc prior to the radon measurements the wind was moderate from 4 0 to 19 6 m s ese direction from the 27th to the 30th october 2012 and low from 3 8 to 5 0 m s sw direction from the 8th to the 10th january 2014 each sampling campaign were preceded by slight to moderate rain events 45 mm on the 23rd october 2012 20 mm on the 05th january 2014 since seawater typically displays low activity the sensitivity of the system was increased using two rad7 monitors connected with the rad aqua in closed loop mayer et al 2016 the water was pumped with a 4 5 l min flow rate for injection into the radaqua water exchanger the 222rn activity measure is determined from the decay of daughter isotope 218po when the equilibrium in the air loop between the gas exchanger and the two rad7 monitors is reached dimova et al 2009 the 222rn activity of water is then calculated from that of air knowing the partition ostwald coefficient which depends on salinity and temperature schubert et al 2011 for the coastlines survey all devices were installed on a semi rigid vessel equipped with gps e c and t data loggers the system allowed continuous measurements during navigation or fixed position for more detailed information sampling and analytical process are consistent with those outlined in mayer et al 2016 the 223ra and 224ra activities were measured using mn fibers by filtration of surface water groundwater and seawater samples sample positions for the bonifacio harbour are the same as for 222rn the fibers were analysed using radecc counters systems at the emmah and cerege laboratories moore and arnold 1996 calibration was made by using in house mono isotope standards of 227ac and 232th parents of 223ra and 224ra respectively and multi isotope standards containing 227ac 232th and 226ra all standards were prepared according to the technique of scholten et al 2010 efficiencies changes with time are within the error range and thus not significant errors were calculated according to garcia solsona et al 2008 to assess whether the diffusive release of radionuclides from sediments could be a significant radon source five sediment samples were collected from the sea beaches of paraguanu pertusatu san mulari sant amanza and canettu fig 1 to estimate 222rn diffusion from sediment activities in pore water were analysed following the equilibration method corbett et al 1998 burnett et al 2007 kluge et al 2012 experiments were performed with 500 g of dry sediment equilibrated in closed glass bottles with 900 ml of ra free seawater previously filtrated through mn fiber seawater and sediment were equilibrated in closed bottles over one month according to the protocol of corbett et al 1998 4 results and discussion 4 1 sgd flows detection from airborne tir images the seawater surface temperature obtained in september 2011 through the tir image varies from 19 7 to 23 5 c along the coast fig 2 in the harbour red hotspots correspond to pontoons and moored boats the most common value range between 21 2 c and 23 5 c due to summer conditions but the temperature may be less than 21 2 c locally this is especially the case in the sant amanza bay and in the bonifacio harbour where a discreet but detectable decrease in temperature is observed this low thermal contrast is obviously the result of a high thermal diffusion of groundwater in the sea no plumes are visible unlike on other sgd flows studies tamborski et al 2015 bejannin et al 2017 but this weak and progressive decrease in temperature is a first clue arguing in favour of low and diffuse sgd flows as expected for this mediterranean porous aquifer the slight decrease in temperature is detectable over a length of around 350 m in the sant amanaza bay and 140 m in the bonifacio harbour furthermore cooler temperatures less than 21 2 c are also observed at the extreme south of the plateau this is probably due to the wind occurring in this specific area during the flight 7 8 m s ese direction measured at the pertusato meteo france weather station 4 2 groundwater rock interactions as a source of radionuclides in sgd flows groundwater from the upper aquifer bonifacio geologic formation and stream water were investigated to characterize their hydrochemical and isotopic signatures and to identify mineralization processes that may further help the sgd flows detection table 1 groundwater temperatures are close to the average annual atmospheric temperature at bonifacio 16 8 c involving a low dynamic of renewal that favour water rocks interactions within the aquifer santoni et al 2016b the ec is rather high for all samples with values from 990 to 2040 µs cm and is mainly influenced by hco3 cl ca and na contents the ph values as well as the high contents in hco3 and ca indicate interactions with the aquifer carbonate matrix the high na cl and mg contents denote an influence from the sea but the negative δ2h and δ18o signatures exclude any large seawater intrusion into the aquifer and rather suggest the influence of sea sprays in the mineralization santoni et al 2016a groundwater no3 contents comply with those found in natural waters except for three samples above 20 mg l which highlight locally the vulnerability of the aquifer influenced by human activities sio2 and u contents are noticeable with values up to 17 mg l and 1 5 µg l respectively with a correlation coefficient r2 about 0 81 these are elements sourced by granitic rocks surrounding the aquifer or sourced by the calcarenites of the aquifer that include sediments from the granite weathering the 222rn 224ra and 223ra activities were measured in stream and groundwater table 2 the 223ra activity is low less than 1 5 bq m3 compared to the 222rn and 224ra activity varying from 1199 to 27853 bq m3 and from 8 8 to 34 3 bq m3 respectively radon is fairly well correlated to dissolved uranium in groundwater r2 0 79 table 1 suggesting that the main sources of radon are the herynian granites the higher activities are found in groundwater sampled at the interface with the fractured granites rep b18 and cpo b10 stream water canr r1 and groundwater from the plateau display lower radon activities between 1199 and 6081 bq m3 bonifacio groundwater and stream water have therefore radon activities sufficiently elevated to provide a radon signature in seawater expected to be detectable using our rad7 system near the discharge points fig 3 display binary scatter plots combining hydrochemical and isotope data of groundwater along the flow path from the recharge areas until the coastal outlets where the sgd flows measurement is carried out the na cl ca hco3 vs na graph fig 3 a shows the influence of both marine context and carbonated lithology on the groundwater mineralization through the na cl and ca hco3 respectively from the recharge areas to the aquifer outlets the na content coming from sea sprays decrease by dilution due to a mixing of flow lines originated from different recharge process such as focused recharge fast transfert of rainwater to the water table or irrigation recharge santoni et al 2018 in the same time the na cl ca hco3 ratio decreases highlighting an increase in the ca hco3 content due to the calcite dissolution this is well supported by the increase in the saturation indexes si of calcite plotted in fig 3 b moreover in the same figure the increase in the si of strontianite with calcite suggests the control of the magmatic and sedimentary lithologies on groundwater mineralization along the flow path from the granites to the carbonate aquifer as also observed in santoni et al 2016a indeed the high correlation coefficient between saturation indexes of calcite and strontianite highlights dissolution of granites and of calcarenites that includes calcite and granitic alteration products the groundwater mineralization is consequently influenced by the groundwater origins by the contrasted lithologies found along the flow path and finally by complex mixing processes this is also true for the groundwater radon activity the groundwater flow line originating from the granite surroundings allochthonous recharge area displays the higher u concentration and radon activity fig 3 c this feature slightly decreases toward the stentinu canali valley sant amanza bay outlet probably due to mixing with surface water with groundwater from the calcarenites this is well supported by the δ18o enrichment suggesting the progressive addition of evaporated surface water santoni et al 2018 in addition the groundwater flow line originating from the plateau autochthonous recharge area displays lower u concentration and radon activity that remains relatively high and quite stable until the outlet of the saint julien valley bonifacio harbour the sgd flows detection from 222rn survey along the coastlines is then expected to be fruitfull in this context 4 3 sgd flows detection from in situ t e c and 222rn survey along the coastlines the in situ seawater temperatures measured along the coastline during the survey are mainly comprised between 14 5 and 15 0 c fig 4 a typical for winter in the western mediterranean the local decrease in temperature can be probably related to temperature equilibrium with the cold atmosphere especially in shallow areas in addition thermal contrast between the groundwater and the sea or the atmosphere is expected to be very limited especially in case of diffuse outflow during winter when the difference of temperature between the sea and the groundwater is the smallest it is then more relevant to refer to the fig 2 for discussing temperature contrasts more visible during the summer nevertheless tir images and in situ temperature give insights on coastal water bodies structure with differentiated water bodies in the stentinu and in the maora areas of the sant amanza bay as well as within the bonifacio harbour these water bodies does not instantly mix with external seawater suggesting low advection processes to detect the presence of continental freshwater inputs to the seashores in situ e c was also measured during the survey fig 4 b the highest values are between 58 and 61 ms cm and are found along the eastern granitic part of the study site as well as between the bonifacio harbour and pertusatu in opposition lower values between 55 and 58 ms cm are found especially in the northern southern and western part of the bonifacio plateau coasts including the bonifacio harbour and the sant amanza bay stentinu since the e c variation is independent of environmental temperature it is then reasonable to relate a decrease in e c to a continental water inflow even if it does not allow to distinguish between surface and groundwater inputs the fig 4 c displays the radon activity distribution along the coastline the eastern granitic part and the northern plateau coasts display intermediate radon activity comprised between 0 and 40 bq m3 the punctual increase observed along the eastern coast may be explained by very local inputs of fresh groundwater through the intense fracturation of the hercynian granites orsini et al 2010 santoni et al 2016a but in any case they cannot be considered as bonifacio aquifer outlets the coasts surrounding the bonifacio plateau display no or low radon activity at the south and the west except in the harbour and in the sant amanza bay where the values may be greater than 50 bq m3 especially in the maora and stentinu areas the low e c value and low radon activity found at the south and west part of the plateau can be explained by a weak input of surface water in opposition the low e c and high radon activity found in the bonifacio harbour and in the sant amanza bay including the narrow stentinu area of 70 m wide reveals the presence of sgd flows this is in very good agreement with the potentiometric and ageing groundwater flow line directions from santoni 2016 and with the slight decrease in seawater temperature observed from the tir images displayed in fig 2 the fig 5 displays e c box plots as a function of 222rn activity classes for all the coastline survey data the correlation coefficient r2 between e c and 222rn activity is about 0 53 hihlighting a relation between these two variables the lower is the e c higher is the radon activity this means that the e c may be relevant for the detection of sgd flows along the coastlines nevertheless sgd flows may have contrasted effects on coastal seawater e c and 222rn activity according to the groundwater origins i e recharge areas the fig 3 c clearly shows a wide range of 222rn activity in groundwater with the highest values for groundwater coming from the granites area and reaching the stentinu figs 1 4 c as a consequence low sgd flow rates may provide a high 222rn activity with no major influence on e c this observation may explain the moderate r2 value fig 5 even if each parameter individually presents its limits their combination allows here to clearly detect the presence of sgd flows 4 4 estimates of sgd seepage velocities from radon and radium activities an estimate of sgd seepage velocities using radon and radium activities from the fixed measurements carried out over the 1800 m length of the bonifacio harbour fig 1 is here attempted as suggested by in situ temperature repartition along seashores fig 4a highlighting different water masses this calculation assumes that the mixing with external seawater is negligible this assumption was tested evaluating the eddy diffusion deddy coefficient in the harbour s water as in moore 2000 under the assumption of isotropic medium and steady state condition the eddy diffusion coefficient is given by eq 1 1 d eddy λ ln c x where c is the activity of tracer radon or radium isotope x the distance from the input point and lambda the decay constant of the tracer the computed distance vs logarithm activities regression line and eddy diffusion coefficients are reported in fig 6 and table 4 respectively the very good correlation between logarithm of radionuclide activities and distance fig 6 as well as the low eddy diffusion coefficients deduced from them suggests that advection is minimal diffusion and radioactive decay from groundwater inputs in the inner side of the harbour are the dominant processes governing the activity of these tracers in this setting and at the time scales of the half lives of these tracers 3 8 days for 222rn 11 3 days for 223ra and 3 6 days for 224ra this is probably due to the reduced volume and narrow configuration of the harbour the wind was low to moderate during the surveys cf 3 1 3 and the narrow configuration of the bonifacio harbour clealry limits the radon degassing from seawater in this area the radon degassing was therefore not taken into account in the sgd seepage velocity calculation the incertitude introduced by neglecting the degassing term is discussed later to evaluate the potential influence of 222rn diffusion from the sediment not associated to the sgd flows from the aquifer a selection of near shore sediments were sampled over the study area and analysed for the 222rn activity produced by their equilibration with seawater fig 1 table 3 the 222rn diffusive flux obtained from these sediments is very low in the range from 1 4 to 6 2 bq m2 day these marine sediments thus cannot constitute a source of 222rn capable to prevent the detection of sgd flux in order to calculate sgd seepage velocities the 222rn 223ra and 224ra inventories in the harbour have been determined radon and radium activities in function of distance have been fitted by exponential curves that are then integrated over the 1800 m length of the harbour fig 6 the general pattern of 222rn 223ra and 224ra data clearly shows an exponential decrease in their activities with distance implying that the dilution of the isotopic signature with external seawater is negligible the good exponential data fit also suggests that the activities of these tracers are probably in a steady state equilibrium condition between sources groundwater advection and sinks diffusions and decay in the case of the present study the narrow morphology of the harbour and the piezometric gradient organisation implies major flowlines converging into the internal part of the bonificio harbour santoni 2016 for these reasons sgd seepage directly through the bottom sediments of the harbour are expected to be low assuming horizontal sgd flows as constrained by the geomorphology and the salt wedge position i e horizontal convergence of groundwater flow lines in fig 1 the radionuclides activities in groundwater inputs are considered as vertically constant on the innermost face of the harbour made of concretes and limestone then the integrals of the activity in harbour water over the distance correspond to the horizontal tracer s inventories for 1 m2 surface units flowing perpendicularly to the innermost face of the harbour and in direction toward the sea sampling point a to the sampling point f in fig 1 parameters of this calculation distances activities exponential regression equations inventories and resulting seepages for 222rn 223ra and 224ra are reported in table 4 under these assumptions the calculated horizontal inventories are independent of the water depths in the harbour from the horizontal tracer inventories the activity flux bq m2 day of 222rn 223ra and 224ra necessary to maintain the diffusive radioactive decay profile may be calculated for a unit surface perpendicular to the length of the harbour table 4 assuming a steady state condition the groundwater seepage supporting this flux is then calculated dividing the activity flux by the groundwater activity cgw as measured in the sampled point ore w2 fig 1 table 4 the computed sgd seepage velocities necessary to compensate for diffusion and decay thus result about 2 24 and 3 19 m day for 222rn for 2012 and 2014 respectively 22 32 m day for 223ra and 23 67 m day for 224ra the same approach was applied in the sant amanza bay second outlet of the aquifer from using the in situ 222rn in the stentinu and considering cgw as the sampled point cpo b10 the computed sgd flows seepage velocity necessary to compensate for the diffusion and decay is about 1 84 m day table 4 however this estimation is probably impacted by degassing process during flow within the canali valley until the stentinu to avoid this a computation may also be performed considering cgw as the canali river sample point can r1 the computed sgd flows seepage velocity is then about 18 6 m day table 4 the sgd seepage velocities calculated from 222rn 223ra and 224ra are in good agreement with other similar contexts in the mediterranean as obtained in the port miou calanques southern france 0 1 to 0 4 m s in open mediterranean sea in the gulf of lion southern france 23 m s by bejannin et al 2017 nevertheless in view of the fairly large range of sgd flows seepage velocities obtained it appears necessary to validate and better constrain these results 4 5 validation of sgd flows velocities by groundwater darcy velocity the eddy mixing coefficients deduced from the good exponential fit of radionuclides activities over the 1800 m of the bonifacio harbour allow the application of the first fick s law to calculate the sgd freshwater seepage velocity necessary to dilute the seawater salinity in the harbour as observed in the e c profile the flux calculated using the first fick s law assumes a freshwater fraction gradient in the harbour of 1 89e 05 m 1 this gradient is calculated from 3 5 freshwater dilution obtained from the e c difference between inner harbour and offshore waters over a total length of 1800 m fig 1 assuming a steady state condition and e c conservative the seepage velocity of sgd flows of the pure freshwater component necessary to sustain the diffusive profile observed for e c is between 0 44 and 2 06 m day table 4 using respectively the d eddy obtained from 223ra and 224ra profiles unlike for e c the sgd seepage velocities based on 222rn 223ra and 224ra corresponds to the sum of two flows fresh groundwater and recycled seawater the quantification of the seawater recycling is however particularly difficult using radium and radon isotopes because these tracers may be partially scavenged from seawater when intruding a coastal aquifer yielding in this case to an underestimation of total sgd zhang et al 2017 in other setting the recycled seawater flux may constitute a net tracer input in seawater inventory yielding to an overestimation of the real continental water sgd flux rodellas et al 2015 nevertheless by comparing the total sgd seepage velocity obtained from the radon mass balance 2 25 m d and the freshwater sgd seepage velocity obtained from the salinity profile with the first fick s law 2 04 m d we may roughly estimate that the recycled seawater component represents about 10 of the total sgd the fraction of recycled seawater estimated by comparing 224ra or 223ra seepage velocities and freshwater sgd seepage velocity from salinity profile is instead much larger seawater recycling would be about 10 times the freshwater sgd we tend to prefer the estimate based on 222rn because sediment equilibration experiments showed that radon diffusion from sediment is very low seawater recycling through these sediments would therefore not affect significantly the total input flux of radon and so the estimate of total sgd conversely for the radium isotopes since radium diffusion from near shore sediments is unknown the effect of seawater recycling on the total sgd calculation cannot be estimated the total sgd estimate based on 222rn and the radon based seawater recycling fraction was also preferred because the seepage velocities values obtained in 2012 and 2014 yielded similar results table 4 in order to validate the sgd velocities estimates they are now compared with the darcy velocity deduced from hydrodynamic modelling and aquifer recharge rate estimations previously published table 5 shows permeability k for the bonifacio aquifer from existing literature and associated darcy velocity q computed between eb b1 and ore w2 in the saint julien valley considering δl 1173 m and δh 48 m the q values deduced from proton magnetic resonance and pumping tests are between 0 46 and 1 06 m d these values are slightly lower but closest and in the same order of value to sgd seepage velocities from radon and from the fick law table 4 uncertainties nevertheless remain on q values because they are computed from permeability coefficients k issued from different method as well as from various location over the plateau furthermore the darcy groundwater velocities assume a steady state and isotropic porous media which is the case at the saint julien valley s scale chesneaux et al 2018 but not the case at the whole aquifer scale santoni et al 2018 the sgd seepage velocities from radon and from the first fick s law are also in very good agreement with values of groundwater darcy velocity within the bonifacio aquifer from combining analytical solution with geochemical and dating tracers table 5 considering a steady state dupuit type flow in the saint julien valley the analytical solution of chesnaux et al 2018 applied between the sampling points eb b1 and ore w2 and assuming groundwater transit time of 30 years an effective porosity of 7 and a hydraulic conductivity from 1 3 to 3 0 10 4 m s the recharge was calculated to be of 115 mm year i e 23 of the annual rainfall this value is in very good agreement with the aquifer functioning and with the 132 mm year 26 obtained previously for this aquifer using 8 other methods by santoni et al 2018 this highlights the strong relationship of groundwater flow velocity with groundwater residence time effective porosity permeability and recharge for this aquifer from this steady state dupuit type flow in the saint julien valley the darcy groundwater velocity computed considering the permeability range give values between 0 46 and 1 06 m day that is in the same order of value for the sgd flows seepage velocity calculated from 222rn and from the fisrt fick s law allowing the sgd seepage velocities from radon to be considered as robust 4 6 sgd seepage flow and water balance quantification of the bonifacio mediterranean porous aquifer as shown through tir images and in situ measurements the aquifer outlet generates diffuse outflow in the bonifacio harbour and within the sant amanza bay including the stentinu area the computed sgd seepage flow velocities for surface units of 1 m2 being now considered as robust sgd seepage flow rates can be computed by multiplying sgd seepage flow velocities with the discharge area at the outlets the computation of sgd seepage flow rates assumes an outlet width of 140 m and 1 4 m depth in the bonifacio harbour a outlet of 350 m width and 1 5 m depth in the sant amanza bay and a outlet of 70 m width and 1 5 m depth in the stentinu the 222rn seepage velocity considered is 2 24 m d for the bonifacio harbour 1 84 m d in the sant amanza bay and 18 60 m d in the stentinu the total seepage flow rate obtained is then 38 9 l s with 5 1 l s in the bonifacio harbour 11 2 l s in sant amanza and 22 6 l s in the stentinu including the canali river flow the sgd seepage flow rates can now be related to the hydrogeological functionning of the bonifacio aquifer considering a recharge about 132 mm y in a 33 km2 watershed i e 138 l s santoni et al 2018 and a public water supply about 174 638 m3 y i e 5 5 l s santoni 2016 the expected sgd seepage flow rate is expected to be 132 5 l s in these conditions the total 38 9 l s sgd seepage flow rate obtained represents 29 of the expected flow i e 28 of the aquifer recharge rate according to this observation 68 of the recharge water are missing at the identified aquifer outlets assuming that the aquifer recharge value is robust chesnaux et al 2018 santoni et al 2018 many hypothesis may be formulated on this result 1 the field campaign corresponds to a low water level period underestimating the sgd seepage flow rate due to a loss of water pressure within the aquifer 2 due to diffuse sgd flow conditions the major part of the sgd flows is not detected 3 the major part of the recharge water in the upper aquifer level supplies the lower aquifer level by downward drainance the first hypothesis can be rejected because 222rn measurements have been performed in the bonifacio harbour during october 2012 at low water level and during january 2014 at high water level without this causing any major change in the sgd seepage flow velocities 2 24 m d in oct 2012 and 3 19 m d in jan 2014 table 4 that is in relation with the known inertial behavior of the aquifer santoni 2016 the second hypothesis cannot be refuted as it stands but the third hypothesis seems to be the most probable indeed according to santoni et al 2016a the recharge of the lower aquifer by downward drainance is estimated by a combined h2 18o 86sr 87sr approach to be 65 70 this observation implies that the outlet of the lower aquifer is different from those of the upper one the first should be governed by the paleomorphology of the underlying fractured granites whereas the second one may be directly dependant of the present surface morphology organized in valleys wsw ene oriented explaining the bonifacio harbour and sant amanza outlets the outlet s of the lower aquifer is are probably located further offshore and at greater depth which explains its their non detection during the survey at 1 m depth performed for this study the sgd seepage flow being now solved it is possible to propose a water balance budget for the whole bonifacio mediterranean porous aquifer fig 7 from an aquifer recharge rate about 132 mm y 32 of the recharge water flows within the upper aquifer until the bonifacio harbour 4 the sant amanza bay 8 and until the stentinu as sgd flows and river flow 16 the public drinking water supply also represents an outlet to the upper aquifer 4 finally 68 of the aquifer recharge rate supply the lower aquifer level by downward drainance from the upper aquifer this water balance then validate and improve the conceptual hydrogeological functioning of the bonifacio aquifer from a management point of view the detection and localization of sgd flows suggest a natural behavior of the aquifer excluding major over pumping and seawater intrusion despite the limited potential of recharge the large interface with the sea the touristic pressure and the changes in the climate this seems to be related to a low withdrawal pressure yet exerted on the aquifer as well as to a predominant focused recharge process implying a fast transfer of rainwater to the water table that may be favored by the increase in high rainfall events due to climate change in the mediterranean hartmann et al 2017 santoni et al 2018 5 conclusions this study allowed to validate and improve the conceptual hydrogeological model of a mediterranean porous aquifer with low potential of recharge and high vulnerability due to a large interface with the sea the tourism pressure and the changes in the climate the experimental approach coupling tir t e c majors ions selected trace elements 2h 18o 222rn 223ra and 224ra proved to be relevant in the detection and quantification of low and diffuse sgd flows highlighting quite natural flow conditions and excluding any major over pumping the acquisition of tir images is able to detect slight temperature variations at the seawater surface such imagery nevertheless loses effectiveness in windy areas the in situ geochemical and isotopic investigations allows ensuring the presence of sufficient radon and radium activities in groundwater to detect sgd flows along the seashores favourable lithology and strong water rock interactions involved by long groundwater residence time favours the radon content in coastal aquifer outlets most of the time the lower is the temperature and the e c the higher are the radon and radium activities the sgd flow velocity required for flow rates calculation from 222rn is validated with groundwater darcy velocity in the aquifer the quantification of sgd flows rates revealed in very good agreement with the known recharge rates and flow conditions within the aquifer such a methodology could be applied to other similar coastal aquifers with low and diffuse sgd flow conditions worldwide for the first time in the mediterranean or in semi arid context a natural tracing experiment based on geochemistry and isotope hydrology tools allowed the quantification of sgd flows to validate the hydrogeological conceptual model and to solve the water balance at the whole aquifer scale this study finally helped to better define the scope in terms of detection limits for tir images associated with in situ geochemical and isotopic tools in the detection of low and diffuse sgd flows

5754,submarine groundwater discharge sgd is considered as a good indicator of the natural behavior of coastal aquifers especially in the case of intense groundwater withdrawal or when the aquifer recharge conditions are limited indeed a decrease in sgd flows would result in saline intrusion compromising the groundwater reservoir use the need for sgd studies in mediterranean and semi arid environments have long been recognized and little is known on low and diffuse flows for this reason the detection and quantification of low and diffuse sgd flows have been attempted in a mediterranean

management of groundwater resources it is necessary to rely on detailed conceptual hydrogeological models this includes the quantification of all water balance terms at the aquifer scale for coastal aquifers an important water balance term is the submarine groundwater discharge sgd burnett et al 2006 baudron et al 2015 the aquifer recharge areas contributing to sgd flows being frequently densely populated sgd flows are then recognized to be a source of nutrients contaminants and pollutants that may affect the coastal hydrosystems functioning kaleris 2006 tomasky holmes et al 2013 rodellas et al 2015 furthermore the amount of fresh sgd flows can reduce or even disappear due to over pumping causing seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers compromising the groundwater reservoir use moujabber et al 2006 mahlknecht et al 2017 nlend et al 2018 the issue of seawater intrusion is obviously stronger for coastal aquifers displaying large interface with the sea that can be worsened by pumping rates mccoy and corbett 2009 mahlknecht et al 2017 and or by increasing climate change effects such as seawater rise sherif and singh 1999 barlow and reichard 2009 werner et al 2013 or modifications in aquifer recharge conditions governing groundwater levels holding et al 2016 meixner et al 2016 santoni et al 2018 bokuniewicz et al 2003 propose a typology for coastal groundwater and provides order of magnitude for sgd flows rates in porous media from various location and climate conditions highlighting very low values around 1 2 l day linear meter in arid regions such coastal aquifers displaying low sgd flows are then more vulnerable to saline intrusion due to the precarious balance between freshwater and seawater of the salt wedge dependant of climate change coastal drainage geometry and groundwater withdrawal for coastal population irrigation and industrial activities the presence of sgd flows is consequently considered as a good indicator of the natural behavior of aquifers sawyer et al 2017 coastal aquifers of the mediterranean area are known to be particularly vulnerable facing climate and anthropogenic pressures so much so saline intrusions are already common richts et al 2011 pachauri et al 2014 destouni and prieto 2003 made a numerical modelling of whole aquifer water balance terms including sgd flows in a selection of porous aquifers in israel greece and cyprus for several management conditions later mazi et al 2014 2016 used an analytical approach to optimize groundwater exploitation conditions in a selection of porous aquifers located in the nile delta israel and cyprus based on water balance components quantification at the whole aquifer scale too they also define the concept of sustainable management space to prevent any major seawater intrusion in addition to numerical modelling and analytical solutions experimental methodologies have been developed to study sgd flows tir imagery can be used to localize them based on the detection of warm or cold groundwater inputs into the sea with a contrasted temperature rapaglia et al 2015 tamborski et al 2015 this technique has been employed worldwide and may be combined with in situ measurements of t e c and or geochemical tracers including natural radioactive isotopes particularly radon and radium isotopes mulligan and charette 2009 mejías et al 2012 povinec et al 2012 lee 2014 rapaglia et al 2015 tamborski et al 2015 these radionuclides are produced in the aquifer or poral waters of the sediment by the decay chain of uranium and thorium within the aquifer rocks and sediments and are released in coastal waters by advection or diffusion making them useful tracers of sgd flows moore 2000 burnett et al 2006 beck et al 2010 radium isotopes are indeed relevant tools thanks to their wide range of half lives from 3 63 days for 224ra to 1600 years for 226ra they can also be used to describe sgd processes in discriminating freshwater inputs from rivers or aquifers with those of recirculated seawater moore 1996 povinec et al 2006 stieglitz et al 2010 bejannin et al 2017 in the current literature sgd flows are widely investigated through experimental methodologies in mainly large diffuse or channelized flows provided by karst fractured or porous aquifers burnett et al 2003 2006 lamontagne et al 2008 povinec et al 2008 mejías et al 2012 santos et al 2012 post et al 2013 montiel et al 2018 however to our knowledge experimental methodologies have never been used to quantify diffuse sgd flows necessary to solve the water balance at the whole aquifer scale in mediterranean and semi arid areas an experimental multi tracing approach combining tir imagery t e c major ions selected trace elements 2h 18o 222rn 223ra and 224ra was attempted on the well documented mediterranean coastal aquifer of bonifacio corsica island france even if no major seawater intrusion is yet detected the bonifacio aquifer is highly vulnerable facing seawater intrusion because more than a half of its boundaries conditions are the mediterranean sea santoni 2016 in addition the equilibrium between groundwater and seawater is fragile since sgd flows are expected to be low due to limited recharge conditions typical of the mediterranean area stigter et al 2012 ghiglieri et al 2014 previous studies already demonstrated its low potential of recharge chesnaux et al 2018 santoni et al 2018 and highlighted its porous matrix composition orsini et al 2010 reynaud et al 2012 as a consequence the bonifacio coastal aquifer is an ideal study site to evaluate the potential of tir geochemical and isotope tools to detect and quantify low and diffuse sgd flow conditions for this aquifer recharge and groundwater withdrawal rates being already known the sgd flows quantification is intended to validate its conceptual hydrogeological model as well as to solve the water balance at the whole aquifer scale 2 study site the bonifacio aquifer corsica island france is part of a coastal plateau located in the western mediterranean fig 1 the study site is under a typical mediterranean climate with mean annual precipitation and temperature about 605 mm and 16 8 c respectively calculated from 01 2000 to 01 2012 at the bonifacio meteo france station the sector of bonifacio is known for its wind blowing up to 300 days per year often with gusts above 60 80 km h especially in the extreme south of the plateau the bonifacio plateau is constrained in equal proportions by the mediterranean sea at the south and northeast and by granites on east and west its shape is triangular and it extends over only 25 km2 with a mean elevation of 80 m asl it is made of miocene sediments filling a fractured hercynian granitic depression up to 270 m deep continuing in the surface at an altitude of 243 m at the monte corbu west and of 113 m at the punta di san mulari rossi and cocherie 1991 orsini et al 2010 the 3000 inhabitants of the bonifacio city reside mainly along the st julien and the st jean valleys and also around the harbour all the bonifacio municipality coastlines constitute a natural marine reserve of national importance many campgrounds and villas spread all over the plateau are crowded during the summer due to tourism activities equivalent to 1 8 million people each year the hydrogeology of the bonifacio plateau consists of two aquifer levels separated by an aquitard santoni 2016 the two aquifers levels are mainly found in the bonifacio and balistra geologic formations reynaud et al 2012 forming an upper and a lower aquifer level respectively they are separated by an aquitard corresponding to a silty layer of the cala di labra geologic formation both aquifer levels are composed of sandy calcarenites and calcareous sandstones representing a very compacted material with a cemented granular structure whose effective porosity is on average 7 dörfliger et al 2002 chesnaux et al 2018 potentiometric levels and geochemical tracers highlighted a recharge area on the plateau autochthonous recharge and another within the surrounding fractured granitic massifs allochthonous recharge from which two main flow lines are identified in direction of the bonifacio harbour and of the sant amanza bay fig 1 the canali river is the only permanent river and it has very low flow it takes its source at the west within granitic massifs before flowing on the plateau and draining the upper aquifer until the sant amanza bay santoni 2016 the carbonate plateau of bonifacio is in continuity with the large miocene sedimentary basin developing between corsica and sardinia islands the sedimentary deposits of the bonifacio plateau are conditioned by the granitic substratum and the thickness of the sediments is a function of the palaeo morphology of this one since no karst morphology is observed and considering the porous matrix of the aquifer the sgd flows are expected to reach the sea very close to the shorelines and according to the salt wedge position fig 1 the groundwater residence time was estimated from dissolved anthropogenic gases cfcs and sf6 concentrations in groundwater santoni et al 2016b weighted ages range from 0 to 50 years in the upper aquifer and from 35 to 60 years in the lower aquifer implying a low dynamic of renewal and a long residence time amplifying water rock interactions an approach using 87sr 86sr validated groundwater flow pattern and residence time by computing water rocks interaction kinetics and mixing rates between the granites the upper and the lower aquifer santoni et al 2016a recently chesnaux et al 2018 and santoni et al 2018 highlighted favourable aquifer recharge rates about respectively 23 and 26 of annual rainfall that suggests the presence of low but detectable sgd flows near the coastal shores 3 method the investigation strategy consisted in three main steps i the acquisition of airborne tir images of the coastlines on the 9th september 2011 to detect sgd flows ii the measurement of physicochemical parameters short half lives radionuclides 222rn 223ra 224ra major ions trace elements and stable isotopes of the water molecule in one stream and nine groundwater samples fig 1 on the 27th 28th and 30th october 2012 a fixed measurement for 222rn in position a in the harbour was also made iii the measurement of temperature e c 222rn 223ra and 224ra in seashores to validate and refine the sgd flows localisation and also to try their quantification on the 8th 9th and 10th january 2014 the objective of the groundwater and river sampling was to identify the main hydrochemical features to ensure the presence of sufficient radon and radium activities in groundwater to detect sgd flows later in the sea 3 1 thermal infrared imagery tir images were acquired along the carbonated rocks shores on the 09th september 2011 using a flir thermal system b20hsv this period was chosen to provide the best thermal contrast between groundwater and seawater the flight acquisition of airborne tir images was performed by the service provider company l avion jaune the flight was conducted at 2200 m altitude from 10 30 am to 11 00 am without any cloud and during low wind 7 8 m s ese direction at the meteo france weather station of bonifacio pertusatu the atmospheric temperature during the flight was 24 2 c and no significant rain event was observed during the last 6 days the tir camera wave length range from 7 5 to 14 µm with 16 384 grey levels set on a temperature palette between 40 to 150 c with an accuracy of 1 c at 2200 m altitude the pixel field of view is about 2 0 2 0 m 3 2 geochemistry and stable isotopes of the water molecule e c and t were directly measured in the field using a wtw cond 3310 wtw gmbh weilheim germany bicarbonates were also determined in the field with a hach digital titrator hach company loveland usa major ions samples were filtrated through 0 45 mm nitrocellulose membranes in two 50 ml polyethylene bottles before storage at 4 c one bottle was acidified using ultrapure nitric acid for cation analysis a dionex ics 1100 chromatograph thermo fischer scientific waltham usa was used to determine ionic concentrations at the emmah laboratory of the university of avignon france the analysis quality was validated for ionic balance error of less than 5 samples for trace elements were filtered through 0 20 µm nitrocellulose membranes and acidified with ultrapure nitric acid in 50 ml polyethylene bottles before storage at 4 c a thermo fisher q icp ms x series ii was used to determine trace elements concentrations at the aete technical platform of the university of montpellier france samples for the analysis of stable isotopes of the water molecule were collected in 20 ml amber glass bottles with no head space a liquid water stable isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research san jose usa was used in accordance with the analytical scheme recommended by the international atomic energy agency penna et al 2010 at the emmah laboratory of the university of avignon france the analysis quality was checked with standard deviation conditions up to 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h 3 3 222rn 223ra and 224ra activities measurements the 222rn activity was measured in groundwater and in seawater along the coastlines and within the bonifacio harbour in six fixed positions by using a rad7 radon monitor combined with a radaqua water exchanger durridge co inc prior to the radon measurements the wind was moderate from 4 0 to 19 6 m s ese direction from the 27th to the 30th october 2012 and low from 3 8 to 5 0 m s sw direction from the 8th to the 10th january 2014 each sampling campaign were preceded by slight to moderate rain events 45 mm on the 23rd october 2012 20 mm on the 05th january 2014 since seawater typically displays low activity the sensitivity of the system was increased using two rad7 monitors connected with the rad aqua in closed loop mayer et al 2016 the water was pumped with a 4 5 l min flow rate for injection into the radaqua water exchanger the 222rn activity measure is determined from the decay of daughter isotope 218po when the equilibrium in the air loop between the gas exchanger and the two rad7 monitors is reached dimova et al 2009 the 222rn activity of water is then calculated from that of air knowing the partition ostwald coefficient which depends on salinity and temperature schubert et al 2011 for the coastlines survey all devices were installed on a semi rigid vessel equipped with gps e c and t data loggers the system allowed continuous measurements during navigation or fixed position for more detailed information sampling and analytical process are consistent with those outlined in mayer et al 2016 the 223ra and 224ra activities were measured using mn fibers by filtration of surface water groundwater and seawater samples sample positions for the bonifacio harbour are the same as for 222rn the fibers were analysed using radecc counters systems at the emmah and cerege laboratories moore and arnold 1996 calibration was made by using in house mono isotope standards of 227ac and 232th parents of 223ra and 224ra respectively and multi isotope standards containing 227ac 232th and 226ra all standards were prepared according to the technique of scholten et al 2010 efficiencies changes with time are within the error range and thus not significant errors were calculated according to garcia solsona et al 2008 to assess whether the diffusive release of radionuclides from sediments could be a significant radon source five sediment samples were collected from the sea beaches of paraguanu pertusatu san mulari sant amanza and canettu fig 1 to estimate 222rn diffusion from sediment activities in pore water were analysed following the equilibration method corbett et al 1998 burnett et al 2007 kluge et al 2012 experiments were performed with 500 g of dry sediment equilibrated in closed glass bottles with 900 ml of ra free seawater previously filtrated through mn fiber seawater and sediment were equilibrated in closed bottles over one month according to the protocol of corbett et al 1998 4 results and discussion 4 1 sgd flows detection from airborne tir images the seawater surface temperature obtained in september 2011 through the tir image varies from 19 7 to 23 5 c along the coast fig 2 in the harbour red hotspots correspond to pontoons and moored boats the most common value range between 21 2 c and 23 5 c due to summer conditions but the temperature may be less than 21 2 c locally this is especially the case in the sant amanza bay and in the bonifacio harbour where a discreet but detectable decrease in temperature is observed this low thermal contrast is obviously the result of a high thermal diffusion of groundwater in the sea no plumes are visible unlike on other sgd flows studies tamborski et al 2015 bejannin et al 2017 but this weak and progressive decrease in temperature is a first clue arguing in favour of low and diffuse sgd flows as expected for this mediterranean porous aquifer the slight decrease in temperature is detectable over a length of around 350 m in the sant amanaza bay and 140 m in the bonifacio harbour furthermore cooler temperatures less than 21 2 c are also observed at the extreme south of the plateau this is probably due to the wind occurring in this specific area during the flight 7 8 m s ese direction measured at the pertusato meteo france weather station 4 2 groundwater rock interactions as a source of radionuclides in sgd flows groundwater from the upper aquifer bonifacio geologic formation and stream water were investigated to characterize their hydrochemical and isotopic signatures and to identify mineralization processes that may further help the sgd flows detection table 1 groundwater temperatures are close to the average annual atmospheric temperature at bonifacio 16 8 c involving a low dynamic of renewal that favour water rocks interactions within the aquifer santoni et al 2016b the ec is rather high for all samples with values from 990 to 2040 µs cm and is mainly influenced by hco3 cl ca and na contents the ph values as well as the high contents in hco3 and ca indicate interactions with the aquifer carbonate matrix the high na cl and mg contents denote an influence from the sea but the negative δ2h and δ18o signatures exclude any large seawater intrusion into the aquifer and rather suggest the influence of sea sprays in the mineralization santoni et al 2016a groundwater no3 contents comply with those found in natural waters except for three samples above 20 mg l which highlight locally the vulnerability of the aquifer influenced by human activities sio2 and u contents are noticeable with values up to 17 mg l and 1 5 µg l respectively with a correlation coefficient r2 about 0 81 these are elements sourced by granitic rocks surrounding the aquifer or sourced by the calcarenites of the aquifer that include sediments from the granite weathering the 222rn 224ra and 223ra activities were measured in stream and groundwater table 2 the 223ra activity is low less than 1 5 bq m3 compared to the 222rn and 224ra activity varying from 1199 to 27853 bq m3 and from 8 8 to 34 3 bq m3 respectively radon is fairly well correlated to dissolved uranium in groundwater r2 0 79 table 1 suggesting that the main sources of radon are the herynian granites the higher activities are found in groundwater sampled at the interface with the fractured granites rep b18 and cpo b10 stream water canr r1 and groundwater from the plateau display lower radon activities between 1199 and 6081 bq m3 bonifacio groundwater and stream water have therefore radon activities sufficiently elevated to provide a radon signature in seawater expected to be detectable using our rad7 system near the discharge points fig 3 display binary scatter plots combining hydrochemical and isotope data of groundwater along the flow path from the recharge areas until the coastal outlets where the sgd flows measurement is carried out the na cl ca hco3 vs na graph fig 3 a shows the influence of both marine context and carbonated lithology on the groundwater mineralization through the na cl and ca hco3 respectively from the recharge areas to the aquifer outlets the na content coming from sea sprays decrease by dilution due to a mixing of flow lines originated from different recharge process such as focused recharge fast transfert of rainwater to the water table or irrigation recharge santoni et al 2018 in the same time the na cl ca hco3 ratio decreases highlighting an increase in the ca hco3 content due to the calcite dissolution this is well supported by the increase in the saturation indexes si of calcite plotted in fig 3 b moreover in the same figure the increase in the si of strontianite with calcite suggests the control of the magmatic and sedimentary lithologies on groundwater mineralization along the flow path from the granites to the carbonate aquifer as also observed in santoni et al 2016a indeed the high correlation coefficient between saturation indexes of calcite and strontianite highlights dissolution of granites and of calcarenites that includes calcite and granitic alteration products the groundwater mineralization is consequently influenced by the groundwater origins by the contrasted lithologies found along the flow path and finally by complex mixing processes this is also true for the groundwater radon activity the groundwater flow line originating from the granite surroundings allochthonous recharge area displays the higher u concentration and radon activity fig 3 c this feature slightly decreases toward the stentinu canali valley sant amanza bay outlet probably due to mixing with surface water with groundwater from the calcarenites this is well supported by the δ18o enrichment suggesting the progressive addition of evaporated surface water santoni et al 2018 in addition the groundwater flow line originating from the plateau autochthonous recharge area displays lower u concentration and radon activity that remains relatively high and quite stable until the outlet of the saint julien valley bonifacio harbour the sgd flows detection from 222rn survey along the coastlines is then expected to be fruitfull in this context 4 3 sgd flows detection from in situ t e c and 222rn survey along the coastlines the in situ seawater temperatures measured along the coastline during the survey are mainly comprised between 14 5 and 15 0 c fig 4 a typical for winter in the western mediterranean the local decrease in temperature can be probably related to temperature equilibrium with the cold atmosphere especially in shallow areas in addition thermal contrast between the groundwater and the sea or the atmosphere is expected to be very limited especially in case of diffuse outflow during winter when the difference of temperature between the sea and the groundwater is the smallest it is then more relevant to refer to the fig 2 for discussing temperature contrasts more visible during the summer nevertheless tir images and in situ temperature give insights on coastal water bodies structure with differentiated water bodies in the stentinu and in the maora areas of the sant amanza bay as well as within the bonifacio harbour these water bodies does not instantly mix with external seawater suggesting low advection processes to detect the presence of continental freshwater inputs to the seashores in situ e c was also measured during the survey fig 4 b the highest values are between 58 and 61 ms cm and are found along the eastern granitic part of the study site as well as between the bonifacio harbour and pertusatu in opposition lower values between 55 and 58 ms cm are found especially in the northern southern and western part of the bonifacio plateau coasts including the bonifacio harbour and the sant amanza bay stentinu since the e c variation is independent of environmental temperature it is then reasonable to relate a decrease in e c to a continental water inflow even if it does not allow to distinguish between surface and groundwater inputs the fig 4 c displays the radon activity distribution along the coastline the eastern granitic part and the northern plateau coasts display intermediate radon activity comprised between 0 and 40 bq m3 the punctual increase observed along the eastern coast may be explained by very local inputs of fresh groundwater through the intense fracturation of the hercynian granites orsini et al 2010 santoni et al 2016a but in any case they cannot be considered as bonifacio aquifer outlets the coasts surrounding the bonifacio plateau display no or low radon activity at the south and the west except in the harbour and in the sant amanza bay where the values may be greater than 50 bq m3 especially in the maora and stentinu areas the low e c value and low radon activity found at the south and west part of the plateau can be explained by a weak input of surface water in opposition the low e c and high radon activity found in the bonifacio harbour and in the sant amanza bay including the narrow stentinu area of 70 m wide reveals the presence of sgd flows this is in very good agreement with the potentiometric and ageing groundwater flow line directions from santoni 2016 and with the slight decrease in seawater temperature observed from the tir images displayed in fig 2 the fig 5 displays e c box plots as a function of 222rn activity classes for all the coastline survey data the correlation coefficient r2 between e c and 222rn activity is about 0 53 hihlighting a relation between these two variables the lower is the e c higher is the radon activity this means that the e c may be relevant for the detection of sgd flows along the coastlines nevertheless sgd flows may have contrasted effects on coastal seawater e c and 222rn activity according to the groundwater origins i e recharge areas the fig 3 c clearly shows a wide range of 222rn activity in groundwater with the highest values for groundwater coming from the granites area and reaching the stentinu figs 1 4 c as a consequence low sgd flow rates may provide a high 222rn activity with no major influence on e c this observation may explain the moderate r2 value fig 5 even if each parameter individually presents its limits their combination allows here to clearly detect the presence of sgd flows 4 4 estimates of sgd seepage velocities from radon and radium activities an estimate of sgd seepage velocities using radon and radium activities from the fixed measurements carried out over the 1800 m length of the bonifacio harbour fig 1 is here attempted as suggested by in situ temperature repartition along seashores fig 4a highlighting different water masses this calculation assumes that the mixing with external seawater is negligible this assumption was tested evaluating the eddy diffusion deddy coefficient in the harbour s water as in moore 2000 under the assumption of isotropic medium and steady state condition the eddy diffusion coefficient is given by eq 1 1 d eddy λ ln c x where c is the activity of tracer radon or radium isotope x the distance from the input point and lambda the decay constant of the tracer the computed distance vs logarithm activities regression line and eddy diffusion coefficients are reported in fig 6 and table 4 respectively the very good correlation between logarithm of radionuclide activities and distance fig 6 as well as the low eddy diffusion coefficients deduced from them suggests that advection is minimal diffusion and radioactive decay from groundwater inputs in the inner side of the harbour are the dominant processes governing the activity of these tracers in this setting and at the time scales of the half lives of these tracers 3 8 days for 222rn 11 3 days for 223ra and 3 6 days for 224ra this is probably due to the reduced volume and narrow configuration of the harbour the wind was low to moderate during the surveys cf 3 1 3 and the narrow configuration of the bonifacio harbour clealry limits the radon degassing from seawater in this area the radon degassing was therefore not taken into account in the sgd seepage velocity calculation the incertitude introduced by neglecting the degassing term is discussed later to evaluate the potential influence of 222rn diffusion from the sediment not associated to the sgd flows from the aquifer a selection of near shore sediments were sampled over the study area and analysed for the 222rn activity produced by their equilibration with seawater fig 1 table 3 the 222rn diffusive flux obtained from these sediments is very low in the range from 1 4 to 6 2 bq m2 day these marine sediments thus cannot constitute a source of 222rn capable to prevent the detection of sgd flux in order to calculate sgd seepage velocities the 222rn 223ra and 224ra inventories in the harbour have been determined radon and radium activities in function of distance have been fitted by exponential curves that are then integrated over the 1800 m length of the harbour fig 6 the general pattern of 222rn 223ra and 224ra data clearly shows an exponential decrease in their activities with distance implying that the dilution of the isotopic signature with external seawater is negligible the good exponential data fit also suggests that the activities of these tracers are probably in a steady state equilibrium condition between sources groundwater advection and sinks diffusions and decay in the case of the present study the narrow morphology of the harbour and the piezometric gradient organisation implies major flowlines converging into the internal part of the bonificio harbour santoni 2016 for these reasons sgd seepage directly through the bottom sediments of the harbour are expected to be low assuming horizontal sgd flows as constrained by the geomorphology and the salt wedge position i e horizontal convergence of groundwater flow lines in fig 1 the radionuclides activities in groundwater inputs are considered as vertically constant on the innermost face of the harbour made of concretes and limestone then the integrals of the activity in harbour water over the distance correspond to the horizontal tracer s inventories for 1 m2 surface units flowing perpendicularly to the innermost face of the harbour and in direction toward the sea sampling point a to the sampling point f in fig 1 parameters of this calculation distances activities exponential regression equations inventories and resulting seepages for 222rn 223ra and 224ra are reported in table 4 under these assumptions the calculated horizontal inventories are independent of the water depths in the harbour from the horizontal tracer inventories the activity flux bq m2 day of 222rn 223ra and 224ra necessary to maintain the diffusive radioactive decay profile may be calculated for a unit surface perpendicular to the length of the harbour table 4 assuming a steady state condition the groundwater seepage supporting this flux is then calculated dividing the activity flux by the groundwater activity cgw as measured in the sampled point ore w2 fig 1 table 4 the computed sgd seepage velocities necessary to compensate for diffusion and decay thus result about 2 24 and 3 19 m day for 222rn for 2012 and 2014 respectively 22 32 m day for 223ra and 23 67 m day for 224ra the same approach was applied in the sant amanza bay second outlet of the aquifer from using the in situ 222rn in the stentinu and considering cgw as the sampled point cpo b10 the computed sgd flows seepage velocity necessary to compensate for the diffusion and decay is about 1 84 m day table 4 however this estimation is probably impacted by degassing process during flow within the canali valley until the stentinu to avoid this a computation may also be performed considering cgw as the canali river sample point can r1 the computed sgd flows seepage velocity is then about 18 6 m day table 4 the sgd seepage velocities calculated from 222rn 223ra and 224ra are in good agreement with other similar contexts in the mediterranean as obtained in the port miou calanques southern france 0 1 to 0 4 m s in open mediterranean sea in the gulf of lion southern france 23 m s by bejannin et al 2017 nevertheless in view of the fairly large range of sgd flows seepage velocities obtained it appears necessary to validate and better constrain these results 4 5 validation of sgd flows velocities by groundwater darcy velocity the eddy mixing coefficients deduced from the good exponential fit of radionuclides activities over the 1800 m of the bonifacio harbour allow the application of the first fick s law to calculate the sgd freshwater seepage velocity necessary to dilute the seawater salinity in the harbour as observed in the e c profile the flux calculated using the first fick s law assumes a freshwater fraction gradient in the harbour of 1 89e 05 m 1 this gradient is calculated from 3 5 freshwater dilution obtained from the e c difference between inner harbour and offshore waters over a total length of 1800 m fig 1 assuming a steady state condition and e c conservative the seepage velocity of sgd flows of the pure freshwater component necessary to sustain the diffusive profile observed for e c is between 0 44 and 2 06 m day table 4 using respectively the d eddy obtained from 223ra and 224ra profiles unlike for e c the sgd seepage velocities based on 222rn 223ra and 224ra corresponds to the sum of two flows fresh groundwater and recycled seawater the quantification of the seawater recycling is however particularly difficult using radium and radon isotopes because these tracers may be partially scavenged from seawater when intruding a coastal aquifer yielding in this case to an underestimation of total sgd zhang et al 2017 in other setting the recycled seawater flux may constitute a net tracer input in seawater inventory yielding to an overestimation of the real continental water sgd flux rodellas et al 2015 nevertheless by comparing the total sgd seepage velocity obtained from the radon mass balance 2 25 m d and the freshwater sgd seepage velocity obtained from the salinity profile with the first fick s law 2 04 m d we may roughly estimate that the recycled seawater component represents about 10 of the total sgd the fraction of recycled seawater estimated by comparing 224ra or 223ra seepage velocities and freshwater sgd seepage velocity from salinity profile is instead much larger seawater recycling would be about 10 times the freshwater sgd we tend to prefer the estimate based on 222rn because sediment equilibration experiments showed that radon diffusion from sediment is very low seawater recycling through these sediments would therefore not affect significantly the total input flux of radon and so the estimate of total sgd conversely for the radium isotopes since radium diffusion from near shore sediments is unknown the effect of seawater recycling on the total sgd calculation cannot be estimated the total sgd estimate based on 222rn and the radon based seawater recycling fraction was also preferred because the seepage velocities values obtained in 2012 and 2014 yielded similar results table 4 in order to validate the sgd velocities estimates they are now compared with the darcy velocity deduced from hydrodynamic modelling and aquifer recharge rate estimations previously published table 5 shows permeability k for the bonifacio aquifer from existing literature and associated darcy velocity q computed between eb b1 and ore w2 in the saint julien valley considering δl 1173 m and δh 48 m the q values deduced from proton magnetic resonance and pumping tests are between 0 46 and 1 06 m d these values are slightly lower but closest and in the same order of value to sgd seepage velocities from radon and from the fick law table 4 uncertainties nevertheless remain on q values because they are computed from permeability coefficients k issued from different method as well as from various location over the plateau furthermore the darcy groundwater velocities assume a steady state and isotropic porous media which is the case at the saint julien valley s scale chesneaux et al 2018 but not the case at the whole aquifer scale santoni et al 2018 the sgd seepage velocities from radon and from the first fick s law are also in very good agreement with values of groundwater darcy velocity within the bonifacio aquifer from combining analytical solution with geochemical and dating tracers table 5 considering a steady state dupuit type flow in the saint julien valley the analytical solution of chesnaux et al 2018 applied between the sampling points eb b1 and ore w2 and assuming groundwater transit time of 30 years an effective porosity of 7 and a hydraulic conductivity from 1 3 to 3 0 10 4 m s the recharge was calculated to be of 115 mm year i e 23 of the annual rainfall this value is in very good agreement with the aquifer functioning and with the 132 mm year 26 obtained previously for this aquifer using 8 other methods by santoni et al 2018 this highlights the strong relationship of groundwater flow velocity with groundwater residence time effective porosity permeability and recharge for this aquifer from this steady state dupuit type flow in the saint julien valley the darcy groundwater velocity computed considering the permeability range give values between 0 46 and 1 06 m day that is in the same order of value for the sgd flows seepage velocity calculated from 222rn and from the fisrt fick s law allowing the sgd seepage velocities from radon to be considered as robust 4 6 sgd seepage flow and water balance quantification of the bonifacio mediterranean porous aquifer as shown through tir images and in situ measurements the aquifer outlet generates diffuse outflow in the bonifacio harbour and within the sant amanza bay including the stentinu area the computed sgd seepage flow velocities for surface units of 1 m2 being now considered as robust sgd seepage flow rates can be computed by multiplying sgd seepage flow velocities with the discharge area at the outlets the computation of sgd seepage flow rates assumes an outlet width of 140 m and 1 4 m depth in the bonifacio harbour a outlet of 350 m width and 1 5 m depth in the sant amanza bay and a outlet of 70 m width and 1 5 m depth in the stentinu the 222rn seepage velocity considered is 2 24 m d for the bonifacio harbour 1 84 m d in the sant amanza bay and 18 60 m d in the stentinu the total seepage flow rate obtained is then 38 9 l s with 5 1 l s in the bonifacio harbour 11 2 l s in sant amanza and 22 6 l s in the stentinu including the canali river flow the sgd seepage flow rates can now be related to the hydrogeological functionning of the bonifacio aquifer considering a recharge about 132 mm y in a 33 km2 watershed i e 138 l s santoni et al 2018 and a public water supply about 174 638 m3 y i e 5 5 l s santoni 2016 the expected sgd seepage flow rate is expected to be 132 5 l s in these conditions the total 38 9 l s sgd seepage flow rate obtained represents 29 of the expected flow i e 28 of the aquifer recharge rate according to this observation 68 of the recharge water are missing at the identified aquifer outlets assuming that the aquifer recharge value is robust chesnaux et al 2018 santoni et al 2018 many hypothesis may be formulated on this result 1 the field campaign corresponds to a low water level period underestimating the sgd seepage flow rate due to a loss of water pressure within the aquifer 2 due to diffuse sgd flow conditions the major part of the sgd flows is not detected 3 the major part of the recharge water in the upper aquifer level supplies the lower aquifer level by downward drainance the first hypothesis can be rejected because 222rn measurements have been performed in the bonifacio harbour during october 2012 at low water level and during january 2014 at high water level without this causing any major change in the sgd seepage flow velocities 2 24 m d in oct 2012 and 3 19 m d in jan 2014 table 4 that is in relation with the known inertial behavior of the aquifer santoni 2016 the second hypothesis cannot be refuted as it stands but the third hypothesis seems to be the most probable indeed according to santoni et al 2016a the recharge of the lower aquifer by downward drainance is estimated by a combined h2 18o 86sr 87sr approach to be 65 70 this observation implies that the outlet of the lower aquifer is different from those of the upper one the first should be governed by the paleomorphology of the underlying fractured granites whereas the second one may be directly dependant of the present surface morphology organized in valleys wsw ene oriented explaining the bonifacio harbour and sant amanza outlets the outlet s of the lower aquifer is are probably located further offshore and at greater depth which explains its their non detection during the survey at 1 m depth performed for this study the sgd seepage flow being now solved it is possible to propose a water balance budget for the whole bonifacio mediterranean porous aquifer fig 7 from an aquifer recharge rate about 132 mm y 32 of the recharge water flows within the upper aquifer until the bonifacio harbour 4 the sant amanza bay 8 and until the stentinu as sgd flows and river flow 16 the public drinking water supply also represents an outlet to the upper aquifer 4 finally 68 of the aquifer recharge rate supply the lower aquifer level by downward drainance from the upper aquifer this water balance then validate and improve the conceptual hydrogeological functioning of the bonifacio aquifer from a management point of view the detection and localization of sgd flows suggest a natural behavior of the aquifer excluding major over pumping and seawater intrusion despite the limited potential of recharge the large interface with the sea the touristic pressure and the changes in the climate this seems to be related to a low withdrawal pressure yet exerted on the aquifer as well as to a predominant focused recharge process implying a fast transfer of rainwater to the water table that may be favored by the increase in high rainfall events due to climate change in the mediterranean hartmann et al 2017 santoni et al 2018 5 conclusions this study allowed to validate and improve the conceptual hydrogeological model of a mediterranean porous aquifer with low potential of recharge and high vulnerability due to a large interface with the sea the tourism pressure and the changes in the climate the experimental approach coupling tir t e c majors ions selected trace elements 2h 18o 222rn 223ra and 224ra proved to be relevant in the detection and quantification of low and diffuse sgd flows highlighting quite natural flow conditions and excluding any major over pumping the acquisition of tir images is able to detect slight temperature variations at the seawater surface such imagery nevertheless loses effectiveness in windy areas the in situ geochemical and isotopic investigations allows ensuring the presence of sufficient radon and radium activities in groundwater to detect sgd flows along the seashores favourable lithology and strong water rock interactions involved by long groundwater residence time favours the radon content in coastal aquifer outlets most of the time the lower is the temperature and the e c the higher are the radon and radium activities the sgd flow velocity required for flow rates calculation from 222rn is validated with groundwater darcy velocity in the aquifer the quantification of sgd flows rates revealed in very good agreement with the known recharge rates and flow conditions within the aquifer such a methodology could be applied to other similar coastal aquifers with low and diffuse sgd flow conditions worldwide for the first time in the mediterranean or in semi arid context a natural tracing experiment based on geochemistry and isotope hydrology tools allowed the quantification of sgd flows to validate the hydrogeological conceptual model and to solve the water balance at the whole aquifer scale this study finally helped to better define the scope in terms of detection limits for tir images associated with in situ geochemical and isotopic tools in the detection of low and diffuse sgd flows
