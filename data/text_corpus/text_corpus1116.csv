5580,land use change is one of the dominant driving factors of watershed hydrological change thus hydrological responses to land use changes require detailed assessments to ensure sustainable management of both water resources and natural ecosystems the soil and water assessment tool swat model has been widely used to simulate the impacts of land use change on water balance however the original swat model has poor performance in estimating the leaf area index lai of different vegetation types for tropical areas the objective of this study was to simulate the impact of different land use change scenarios deforestation afforestation and urbanization on the water balance using an improved swat model with vegetation growth calibrated from modis lai data the north johnstone river catchment in wet tropical eastern australia was selected as the case study area results showed that the modified swat model was able to reproduce smoothed modis lai with nse 0 59 nse 0 for default swat r2 0 70 r2 0 66 for default swat and pbias 2 5 pbias 42 for default swat and to predict monthly streamflow well with nse 0 92 nse 0 90 for default swat r2 0 94 r2 0 90 for default swat it is noted that swat t had pbias 10 while pbias 5 for default swat land use change impacted all hydrological variables with the impact on surface runoff being the most notable at yearly scale 8 9 5 7 9 5 and 15 9 for scenario 1 2 3 and 4 respectively absolute changes of surface runoff under land use change scenarios differed across months with the most notable absolute change occurring during the wet season december to may 1 2 6 6 mm 1 0 3 5 mm 7 3 1 1 mm and 3 0 9 0 mm for scenario 1 2 3 and 4 respectively urbanization increased surface runoff 5 7 and 15 9 for scenario 2 and 4 respectively and decreased lateral runoff 0 7 and 1 3 and groundwater 0 9 and 3 5 but produced no clear change in total runoff 0 2 and 0 2 actual evapotranspiration 0 3 and 0 3 and soil water 0 5 and 0 7 at the annual time scale furthermore afforestation could decrease surface runoff 9 5 for scenario 3 and soil water 2 0 increase evapotranspiration 1 7 and lead to slight changes absolute values 0 8 in other hydrological variables at the annual time scale a strong positive correlation r 0 94 was observed between annual rainfall and total runoff for forest evergreen range grasses and urban land use forest evergreen generally produced less total runoff than range grasses and urban land use under conditions of the same rainfall terrain slope and soil texture in addition urban land use generally produced more surface runoff and less lateral runoff and groundwater than forest evergreen and range grasses under the same conditions these results contribute important information for development of

temporal changes in land use land cover that can affect water flow pathways and the water balance welde and gebremariam 2017 land use cover change lucc plays an important role in earth atmosphere interactions and biodiversity loss and is a major factor influencing sustainable development turner et al 1995 lucc can directly affect global carbon budgets biodiversity and ecosystem function aide et al 2013 many regions worldwide have experienced massive lucc over recent decades schirpke et al 2012 although the net decrease of natural forest area was slowing down globally in the period from 2000 to 2010 meyfroidt and lambin 2011 deforestation remains one of the major processes of lucc with multiple implications for global environmental change lambin and geist 2008 for example a large amount of natural land in china including wetlands and forests has been developed into arable land and human settlements due to rapid urbanization over the past two decades song and ding 2009 yu et al 2011 extensive deforestation occurred in latin america and the caribbean during the first decade of the 21st century but extensive areas also recovered woody vegetation 360 000 km2 across the region aide et al 2013 about 30 of total forest land is under pressure from rapid lucc in northeast india which is one of the recognized global biodiversity hotspots lele and joshi 2009 since 1990 australia s plantation area has increased by around 700 000 ha parsons et al 2007 the extensive lucc in australia along with agricultural development has induced an instability in the water cycle leading to increased land and water salinization over massive areas zhang et al 2001 in the study of hydrological responses to lucc forest hydrological effects have attracted much attention especially the impacts of afforestation and deforestation most results have shown that catchment runoff decreased significantly after afforestation and increased obviously after deforestation li et al 2012 for example crosbie et al 2007 concluded that runoff was significantly reduced in five years after the land use of annual cropping and pastures changed to tree belts with perennial pastures in a small agricultural catchment in central nsw australia chen and yu 2015 assessed likely impacts of two lucc scenarios in southeast queensland and found that extreme lucc would significantly affect flooding in rural catchments but not in urbanized catchments the importance of water in both nature and society emphasizes the necessity for greater understanding how lucc could influence regional streamflow regimes there are three main methods used to quantitatively analyze the impacts of lucc on hydrology and water resources 1 the paired catchment experimental method bosch and hewlett 1982 2 the time series analysis method li et al 2012 and 3 the hydrological model method mwangi et al 2016 in the paired catchment experimental method two catchments with similar areas shapes climate vegetation and soil are selected and observed generally the first 3 5 years preferably including a wet year a normal year and a dry year are the control period with no experimental measures after that the land use cover of one of the catchments will be artificially changed while other conditions remain the same the other catchment remains in the original state and is referred to as the reference catchment after an observation period the runoff in the two experimental catchments is compared and analyzed and the impacts of lucc on water quantity are quantitatively analyzed the paired catchment experimental method is generally considered to be the best way to compensate for climate variability in small catchments but the method is difficult to apply to catchments other than small ones as finding two similar medium or large catchments is difficult also even similar catchments may change significantly at different stages li et al 2009 the second method the time series analysis method can be used to analyze the changing trend of hydrologic and climatic data but the spatial heterogeneity of a catchment and the mechanisms of lucc and climate change on the water cycle cannot be determined since the 1970s with the development of computer science geographic information systems and remote sensing technologies hydrological models have been more widely used to determine lucc impacts in water cycle studies hydrological models provide a framework for conceptualizing and studying the relationships among climate change land use change and the water cycle among these models distributed hydrological models have significant applications because they directly relate model parameters to characteristics of the earth s surface legesse et al 2003 therefore determining how to construct a distributed hydrological model to study the hydrological response to lucc is a question that must be researched in depth swat soil and water assessment tool is a semi distributed and physically based watershed scale hydrological model developed by arnold et al 1998 at the usda ars it simulates long term hydrological variables e g streamflow at a daily time scale brown et al 2015 swat is considered to be one of the most appropriate models for assessing hydrological responses water sediment and nutrient loss to land use change in watersheds with different land use soils and management conditions arnold and fohrer 2005 in general managing vegetation growth is necessary in distributed hydrological models because evapotranspiration is an important component of the water cycle abbaspour et al 2015 a simple plant growth model is used in swat to simulate growth and yield of all kinds of vegetation abbaspour et al 2015 the plant growth model in swat was developed for temperate areas and is not suitable for monsoon driven or tropical regions wagner et al 2011 for instance the day length driven dormancy used in temperate areas to separate annual plant cycles is not consistent with plant growth in the tropics therefore the model s suitability to simulate plant growth has not been reflected critically in most swat research for tropical areas possibly because model calibration and validation are normally based on streamflow and or water quality outputs strauch and volk 2013 however successfully reproducing these outputs does not imply a correct simulation of the internal hydrological processes in a catchment strauch and volk 2013 therefore a few studies have been conducted to improve the plant growth model in swat globally including tropical areas strauch and volk 2013 alemayehu et al 2017 guo et al 2019 ma et al 2019 for instance strauch and volk 2013 presented an alternative approach to automatically trigger new growing seasons during the transition from dry to wet season based on changes in soil moisture for tropical areas meanwhile a general improvement independent of whether or not the area is in tropics has been implemented with the lai decline rate modified to a logistic function which provides a sigmoidal decrease toward the minimum lai their results showed that the modified plant growth model could reasonably represent seasonal dynamics of the lai and the modified model should be useful for large parts of the model community alemayehu et al 2017 modified the swat model for the tropics using a straightforward but robust soil moisture index a quotient of rainfall and reference evapotranspiration to trigger a new growth cycle within a predefined period and results indicated that this index was reliable for triggering a new annual growth cycle in addition ma et al 2019 integrated downscaled high quality modis lai into modified swat plant growth model and reported a high accuracy in the validation of streamflow in the subtropics however to the best of our knowledge the swat model with an improved plant growth model has never before been applied to tropical regions of australia consequently we selected a catchment representative of the tropics in australia to explore and assess the performance of the modified swat swat t model as improved by strauch and volk 2013 the aim is to evaluate the performance of swat t and to assess hydrological responses to land use cover change in wet tropical australia we selected the north johnstone river catchment as a case study the specific objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the performance of the swat t and default swat model for simulating leaf area index lai and streamflow of the north johnstone river catchment 2 using both models swat t and default swat to forecast changes in simulated surface runoff lateral runoff groundwater total runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil water under different land use change scenarios and 3 identify rainfall runoff relationships of different land covers to explain water availability changes caused by land use cover change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the north johnstone river catchment fig 1 is situated in the wet tropics of north queensland the catchment area is about 924 km2 with elevation ranging from 18 m to 1370 m in this catchment the mean annual temperature is about 21 4 c mean annual rainfall is approximately 2740 mm and mean annual runoff is about 1995 mm averaged from 1967 to 2017 rainfall is affected by monsoons and tropical cyclones lows depressions and is strongly seasonal with 78 of the total annual rainfall occurring during the wet season from december to may fig 2 the catchment also receives regular rainfall throughout the year in contrast to dry tropical areas the johnstone river catchment is divided into three distinct regions the upper tablelands or hinterland the central the range or world heritage and the lower coastal or floodplain regions the two key tributaries that discharge into the great barrier reef lagoon are the north johnstone and south johnstone rivers the other major streams are the moresby river liverpool creek and maria creek these three streams are lowland waterways whereas the north and south johnstone rivers begin in the upland mixed land use tablelands agriculture residential and industrial developments including roads can have important impacts on the way water flows through the landscape https wetlandinfo des qld gov au wetlands facts maps sub basin north johnstone river thus understanding how land use cover changes influence regional streamflow regimes is essential for deciding how best to manage the catchment and to protect its resources 2 2 the swat model the swat hydrological model swat 2012 is used to represent the main hydrological processes within the catchment swat is a process based and semi distributed hydrological model that simulates the major water balance components continuously at a daily time step arnold et al 1998 swat can simulate watershed hydrological characteristics under different land use and climate conditions making it a widely used hydrology related tool for land use and climate change research li et al 2011 reshmidevi et al 2017 shrestha et al 2017 however examples from tropical australia are limited with most studies concentrated in the eastern and southeastern part of the country saha and zeleke 2015 the model was selected based on considerations such as its ability to represent the physical processes related to water movement support documentation and additional software swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty programs for model calibration and validation the hargreaves method available in the swat interface was used to calculate potential evapotranspiration reshmidevi et al 2017 using air temperature as input data brown et al 2015 in this study surface runoff and infiltration is computed with daily rainfall using the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method usda 1972 further model details can be found in neitsch et al 2011 however the original swat model performs poorly in estimating lai of different vegetation types for tropical areas thus an improved swat model swat t strauch and volk 2013 was used in this study this approach used simulated plant available water in the upper soil layers as a trigger for a new growing cycle in the swat t model two new parameters tramo1 and tramo2 were implemented to define the first and the last month of a region specific transition period from dry to wet season in this study based on the modis lai the default values of tramo1 and tramo2 were set to 7 july and 8 august in the sub basin input files respectively in addition for this swat t model a logistic function that provides a sigmoidal decrease towards the minimum lai was used to modify the lai decline rate further model details can be found in strauch and volk 2013 according to the user s manual from strauch and volk 2013 no management settings in the operations schedule were defined for the swat t model in this study furthermore the swat t model was calibrated and validated only against streamflow the model simulations were not calibrated and validated with actual evapotranspiration and soil water content due to a lack of field data for these variables the absolute values of actual evapotranspiration and soil water content should therefore not be used directly however comparing the relative changes in the simulations is still reasonable and valuable because the hydrological model mimics the actual water cycle 2 3 data preparation multiple data sets are required in swat as input to develop a semi distributed model using the arcswat interface this section describes the processing of the respective data the data for swat model development data sources and relevant characteristics are listed in table 1 2 3 1 digital elevation model dem land use and soil data swat primarily relies upon defined hydrologic response units hrus that are based on land use maps soil maps and slope characteristics pignotti et al 2017 in this study five slope classes i e 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 50 and 50 were defined for slope discretization and 778 hrus were produced using a multiple hru generation method with land use soil and slope input thresholds of 2 2 2 using the swat interface the details of dem land use and soil data used in this study are given below dem data are required in swat for watershed and river network delineation and sub basin generation in this study 33 sub

johnstone river catchment fig 1 the land use data developed by nasa lp daac at the usgs eros center with 500 m spatial resolution https lpdaac usgs gov products mcd12q1v006 was used and reclassified to match the swat land use classes for hru delineation in the swat model fig 3 a there were eight land use classes in this catchment fig 3a forest evergreen frse forest mixed frst forest deciduous

depth of the soil profile moist bulk density etc for different soil layers are required by the swat model saha et al 2014 we clipped the soil map for the north johnstone river catchment from the digital atlas of australian soil fig 3b based on the available references and lookup tables mckenzie et al 2000 western and mckenzie 2004 saha et al 2014 we created a usersoil database table to delineate hru in swat for the north johnstone river catchment 2 3 2 climate data and river discharge daily maximum temperature minimum temperature and rainfall from 1967 to 2017 at 10 climate stations fig 1 within or near the catchment were collected from the australian government bureau of meteorology bom website http www bom gov au climate data these climate data were used for driving swat model simulations according to the default setting in swat one climate station was assigned to each sub basin which was closest to sub basin s centroid sirisena et al 2018 for streamflow calibration and validation daily observed discharge at the tung oil gauge fig 1 also were collected from the australian government bom website http www bom gov au waterdata for streamflow calibration a calibration period that includes wet normal and dry years was selected so that the model parameters were set for a wide range of climate conditions and also for the validation period accordingly daily observed streamflow data for the periods of 2008 2017 2005 2007 as warm up and 2003 2007 2000 2002 as warm up were used for streamflow calibration and validation respectively whereas daily observed climatic and hydrological data for the 1967 2017 period were used to assess land use change impacts on water availability with the calibrated swat t model to be consistent with the calibration and validation periods for streamflow the same periods were used for lai calibration and validation 2 3 3 leaf area index it was found that the default swat model could not well reflect the dynamics of lai therefore swat simulated lai was calibrated to modis derived four day lai composites using the swat t model strauch and volk 2013 for tropical plant growth this swat t model has been shown to improve the representation of shifts between plant dormancy and growth in tropics by using soil moisture rather than day length to represent crucial phenological thresholds strauch and volk 2013 a 4 day composite mcd15a3h v6 lai dataset with 500 m pixel size was used in this study for each of the land cover classes 4 day median lai time series were extracted from 2003 to 2017 using methods according to previous studies strauch and volk 2013 alemayehu et al 2017 in addition the bfast method verbesselt et al 2010 was used to smooth the 4 day raw median lai time series for different land use covers see supplementary materials s1 hoyos et al 2019 since lai was hru related outputs we derived the area weighted hru mean for comparison with the smoothed median modis lai strauch and volk 2013 and calibrated the lai parameters manually additionally we aggregated daily simulated lai to 4 day scale to calibrate lai parameters using a trial and error process such that the swat t simulated 4 day lai mimicked the modis 4 day lai according to the smoothed lai data supplementary materials s1 agrl and wetl had maximum lai values 2 4 in march and minimum values 1 8 and 1 9 in july and august respectively frse and frsd peaked in october 6 0 and 5 3 and february 5 3 and 5 1 and reached minimum values 3 7 and 4 0 in june rngb and rnge had maximum lai values 3 5 and 2 4 in february and reached minimum values 2 9 and 2 0 in july the high values of smoothed lai were generally observed during the wet season december to may supplementary materials s1 which indicated consistency in the smoothed lai time series thus the plant growth module in the swat t model was calibrated and validated using the smoothed lai time series alemayehu et al 2017 2 4 model calibration and evaluation approach swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup a standalone computer program developed for calibration validation and uncertainty analysis of swat was used to optimize swat model parameters abbaspour 2013 swat cup links five different calibration procedures which are sequential uncertainty fitting ver 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2007 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 particle swarm optimization pso zhang et al 2015 parameter solution parasol van griensven and bauwens 2003 and markov chain monte carlo mcmc marshall et al 2004 the program sufi 2 was selected in this study for swat t calibration validation and uncertainty analysis because it was found to be quite efficient for time consuming large scale models yang et al 2008 two types of sensitivity analysis methods are allowed in the sufi 2 program global sensitivity method and one at a time sensitivity analysis method abbaspour 2013 the global sensitivity analysis method was used to rank the sensitivity of 22 parameters in swat t in this sensitivity analysis method the smaller the p value and the larger the absolute value of t stat the more sensitive the parameter is abbaspour 2013 uncertainty in sufi 2 parameters conveyed as ranges uniform distributions accounts for total sources of uncertainties like uncertainty in driving variables e g rainfall observed data conceptual models and parameters abbaspour 2013 propagation of the parameter uncertainties results in uncertainties in the swat model output variables which are manifested as the 95 probability distributions abbaspour 2013 these are computed at 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution of model output variables produced by the propagation of the uncertainties in parameters using latin hypercube sampling abbaspour 2013 this is called the 95 prediction uncertainty i e 95ppu two statistics p factor and r factor were created to quantify the fit between simulation results 95ppu and observation data with its error abbaspour et al 2015 the p factor is the proportion of observed data enveloped by the simulation results the 95ppu while the r factor is the breadth of the 95ppu envelope monthly observed and simulated discharge for the period of 2008 2017 and 2003 2007 were used for swat t calibration and validation respectively the results for water balance components all were presented at a monthly or annual time step therefore calibrating discharge at a monthly time step rather than daily time step makes the calculation process faster and more efficient monthly streamflow was calibrated with sufi 2 using 500 simulations per iteration 4 iterations by maximizing the value of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 in this study we followed shi et al 2011 by using nse percent bias pbias and coefficient of determination r2 as statistical evaluation criteria nse is one of the most commonly used standards for comparing simulations of hydrological models with observed data le and pricope 2017 nse values vary from to 1 with a value of 1 indicates that the model simulated results and observed data are perfectly matched hence the closer the nse is to 1 the better performance the swat model will have pbias evaluates the average trend of the model simulations to be greater or less than their observed counterparts a positive value of pbias demonstrates an overestimation bias while a negative value indicates an underestimation shi et al 2011 therefore the smaller the absolute value of pbias the better nse pbias and r2 were calculated as follows 1 pbias 100 i 1 n q sim i q obs i i 1 n q obs i 2 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 3 r 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs q sim i q sim 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 i 1 n q sim i q sim 2 where q obs and q sim are the observed and swat t model simulated monthly streamflow m3 s respectively q obs and q sim are the mean observed and swat t model simulated monthly streamflow m3 s respectively n is the number of samples and i is the ith sample 2 5 different land use scenarios the most common land cover classes of the north johnstone river catchment were frse forest evergreen and rnge range grasses which accounted for around 63 7 of the total region to evaluate the hydrological response to land use changes in the catchment four scenarios table 2 were considered these changes were achieved by using the land use update tool in the arcswat interface at the sub basin scale marhaento et al 2017 for instance frse can be considered to be replaced by rnge only if both land use types exist in the same sub basin shrestha et al 2017 therefore these partial conversion scenarios mainly occurred in the northwestern part of the catchment where there is less rainfall distribution compared to the downstream part the forest part of the catchment fig 3 scenario 1 supposes that all current frse will be changed to rnge while the rest of the land covers will remain unchanged this means an 11 5 increase in rnge area over the entire catchment scenario 2 supposes that all current frse will be converted to urbn representing a 2 3 increase in urbn area over the entire catchment scenario 3 supposes that all current rnge will be changed to frse representing a 14 1 increase in frse area over the entire catchment scenario 4 supposes that all current rnge will be converted to urbn representing an 8 4 increase in urbn area over the entire catchment these four land use change scenarios i e deforestation deforestation urbanization afforestation and urbanization were on the basis of present land use conditions and potential future land use plans residential development in the north johnstone river catchment wang et al 2008 the land use change scenarios are shown in table 2 and the percentage areas of the four scenarios are shown in fig 4 frst was classified as frsd in fig 4 because of its small area proportion shown in fig 3 3 results 3 1 swat t lai calibration table 3 presents the calibrated values for lai which were adjusted using a manual calibration method the minimum lai alai min for each land use was defined according to long term modis lai as suggested by strauch and volk 2013 the total number of heat units needed to bring plants to maturity phu plt was calculated using the long term daily mean temperature the shape coefficients frgw1 frgw2 laimx1 laimx2 and dlai for the lai curve and the remaining parameters were calibrated by a trial and error process to ensure that the lai simulated by swat t mimicked the smoothed modis lai the calibrated values and calibration methods for each lai parameter and each land use are shown in table 3 the lai parameters of frst were not calibrated because of the small area proportion in the catchment thus the lai parameters of frsd was used for frst fig 5 shows the comparison between 4 day smoothed modis lai with the swat t simulated lai using calibrated parameters for the different vegetation types in both the calibration and validation periods the degree of agreement for modis and simulated lai were assessed both qualitatively visual comparisons and quantitatively statistical evaluations from a visual comparison it is clear that the plant growth cycles of the different vegetation types simulated by the swat t model corresponded much better with the modis lai data than the default swat results for instance the minimum lai values simulated by the swat t model 1 8 4 0 3 7 2 9 2 0 and 1 9 were similar to the modis lai 1 8 4 0 3 7 2 9 2 0 and 1 9 for agrl frsd frse rngb rnge and wetl respectively while the minimum lai simulated by the default swat was zero for all types of vegetation covers fig 5 also provides the values of the statistical evaluation indices used to assess the performance of swat t simulated lai for frse which was the dominant land cover in the catchment the swat t model performed quite well for lai with the values of nse 0 79 during the calibration and validation periods in contrast calibration and validation performance for wetl and rnge was low when the nse values were 0 59 however r2 values were higher than nse values for all plants types during calibration and validation ranging from 0 70 to 0 91 and pbias values were always within a reasonably small range 2 5 indicating overall good model performance 3 2 discharge calibration and validation the 22 parameters were calibrated and ranked for the discharge calibration in the swat t model in the north johnstone river catchment table 4 these parameters were ranked according to their sensitivities using the global sensitivity analysis method the sensitivity analysis in swat cup suggested that 10 parameters ranked 1 10 table 4 had significant influence on calibration p 0 05 groundwater delay gw delay was found to be the most sensitive calibration parameter in the north johnstone river catchment fig 6 shows the monthly swat t simulated streamflow compared with the observed streamflow during calibration and validation periods visual comparison showed the simulated hydrograph reproduced the observations reasonably well and closely replicated the temporal variation fig 7 shows that monthly observed runoff and the swat t simulated runoff were highly correlated r2 0 94 nse 0 92 and pbias 10 with slopes within 15 of the 1 1 regression during the calibration and validation periods in the north johnstone river catchment furthermore a comparison of swat t and the default swat model was shown in supplementary materials s2 and results showed that swat t simulated streamflow process better than default swat with larger r2 0 94 0 92 and 0 94 0 90 and nse 0 93 0 91 and 0 92 0 90 in calibration and validation period respectively however compared to swat t the default swat model produced smaller absolute percent bias 0 9 7 3 and 4 9 10 0 in calibration and validation period respectively 3 3 hydrological responses to land use change scenarios the calibrated swat t model was applied to simulate the monthly surface runoff surq lateral runoff latq groundwater gwq total runoff actual evapotranspiration et and soil water sw under the four land use change scenarios in 1967 2017 in the north johnstone river catchment fig 8 shows monthly surq latq gwq total runoff et and sw and their changes under different land use scenarios and table 5 summarizes changes in average annual surq latq gwq total runoff et and sw under different land use scenarios it can be seen from fig 8 that surq latq gwq total runoff et and sw had obvious monthly variations with values generally greater in december may summer autumn and less in june november winter spring in addition fig 8 shows that monthly changes among different land use scenarios of surq were more notable than changes of other outputs from swat t meanwhile absolute changes of surq under different land use scenarios differed across months with the most remarkable changes occurring during the wet season from december to may furthermore fig 8 indicates that monthly surq increased under scenarios 1 2 and 4 deforestation or urbanization and decreased under scenario 3 afforestation and similar results can be found for default swat supplementary materials s3 this result was the same for surq at the annual time scale table 5 table 5 indicates that the mean annual surface runoff increased under deforestation scenarios 1 and 2 and urbanization scenarios 2 and 4 for example surface runoff increased 25 mm 8 9 under scenario 1 11 5 decrease in frse area 16 mm 5 7 under scenario 2 2 3 increase in urbn area and 44 mm 15 9 under scenario 4 8 4 increase in urbn area using swat t in contrast the 14 1 increase in frse area scenario 3 led to a 26 mm 9 5 decrease in surface runoff the annual total runoff also increased under deforestation and urbanization and decreased under afforestation but the extent of increase and decrease was much smaller than observed for surface runoff for instance table 5 indicates that total runoff increased by just 11 mm 0 6 under scenario 1 11 5 decrease in frse area and decreased 14 mm 0 7 under scenario 3 14 1 increase in frse area using swat t however annual changes of latq and gwq to urbanization scenarios 2 and 4 were opposite to those of surq and total runoff as shown in table 5 latq and gwq decreased under urbanization for example a 2 3 increase in urbn area scenario 2 led to 0 7 and 0 9 decreases in latq and gwq respectively while an 8 4 increase in urbn area scenario 4 contributed to 1 3 and 3 5 decreases in latq and gwq respectively in addition to runoff table 5 also shows the swat t simulated changes in average annual actual evapotranspiration and soil water under the four scenarios results show that mean annual et decreased by 11 mm 1 3 with an 11 5 reduction in forest area scenario 1 and increased by 14 mm 1 7 with a 14 1 increase in frse area scenario 3 using swat t that is under the deforestation scenario scenario 1 the mean annual et declined with decreased forest area and under the afforestation scenario scenario 3 the mean annual et increased with increased forest area in addition table 5 suggests that the change of soil water in different land use scenarios was opposite to et with a 1 5 increase under deforestation scenario 1 and a 2 0 decrease under afforestation scenario 3 according to table 5 changes in average annual total runoff under scenarios 1 and 3 were more remarkable than under scenarios 2 and 4 the spatial distributions of average annual total runoff under land use scenario 0 and average annual total runoff change under scenarios 1 and 3 compared with scenario 0 using swat t and default swat in different sub basins in the north johnstone river catchment are shown in fig 9 these spatial distributions show that average annual runoff in the eastern sub basins of the catchment were generally greater than those in the western sub basins this was primarily due to the uneven spatial distribution of rainfall with higher rainfall occurring in the eastern area and lower rainfall in the western area compared with scenario 0 average annual runoff increased in scenario 1 under an 11 5 reduction in frse area in some sub basins 4 7 9 10 14 15 19 20 24 28 and 30 while it decreased in scenario 3 under a 14 1 increase in frse area in the same sub basins the reason why changes of average annual runoff occur only in these sub basins is that the replacement of one land use by another land use can be considered only if both land uses are present in the same sub basin as we described in the materials and methods section furthermore fig 9 showed that absolute total runoff changes simulated by default swat were much smaller than that by swat t in 33 different sub basins to quantify the impacts of land use change on rainfall runoff relationships scatter diagrams between annual rainfall and runoff total runoff surq latq and gwq for frse rnge and urbn were plotted fig 10 using the simulated results from swat t and default swat in 1967 2017 from selected hrus hru 30 for frse hru 41 for rnge and hru 52 for urbn in sub basin 4 fig 10a b revealed strong positive correlations r 0 94 between annual rainfall and total runoff for frse rnge and urbn fig 10a b also showed that the plotted cluster of points for frse were generally higher than the rnge and urbn points indicating that frse generally produced less runoff than rnge and urbn under the same rainfall amounts this explains the changes in average annual total runoff in table 5 scenarios 1 2 and 3 and implies that rainfall runoff relationships could be altered by land use changes furthermore fig 10c h indicated that urbn generally produced more surq and less latq and gwq than frse and rnge under the same rainfall amounts 4 discussion 4 1 model comparison and evaluation it was found that in the default plant growth model of swat simulated lai was zero for all plants at the beginning of each simulation year which is not true for plants in tropical areas previous studies mwangi et al 2016 alemayehu et al 2017 hoyos et al 2019 reported similar simulations revealing that the default swat has some shortcomings in modelling vegetation growth in tropical regions while the calibrated swat t model was generally able to replicate bfast filtered modis lai values for each land cover type fig 5 it failed to represent the bimodal seasonality of lai because the model is capable of simulating only one wet dry transition within a year hoyos et al 2019 however the default swat lai mean values failed to correctly represent both lai seasonality and range for all plants fig 5 moreover the precision of modis lai is also very important because it is directly used to calibrate the parameters of hydrological models the average lai of 4 85 average of maximum lai 6 0 and minimum lai 3 7 for frse the dominant land cover in the study area was approximately equal to values previously reported 4 71 0 37 in the literature hill et al 2006 for tropical rainforests across australia overall the lai results simulated by the swat t model were acceptable groundwater delay gw delay was found to be the most sensitive calibration parameter in the north johnstone river catchment table 4 in addition half of the parameters identified as sensitive p 0 05 had an impact on either soil moisture or groundwater flow this may be due to the abundance of groundwater in this area fig 8 and table 5 so the flow in this catchment was dominated by baseflow the baseflow ratio was about 0 44 calculated by gwq total runoff during july 2005 to june 2013 in this study and it was consistent with previous research orr et al 2014 in which the mean daily baseflow was 31 579 m3 s i e baseflow ratio was 0 47 from 1 july 2005 to 1 july 2013 previous studies mcmahon and finlayson 2003 brown et al 2015 also reported that australia s perennial rivers were dominated by baseflow swat parameters associated with baseflow and soil moisture were consistently identified as being highly sensitive to calibration by a review of swat applications gassman et al 2007 supporting the results and suggesting that model operators should focus on these parameters during calibration to guarantee that the swat model is conceptually consistent with regional hydrological conditions according to the general performance ratings suggested by previous studies moriasi et al 2007 shi et al 2011 wallace et al 2018 streamflow modelling is deemed reasonable if nse 0 50 r2 0 50 and pbias within 25 therefore it was shown that the swat t model simulated monthly streamflow well in the north johnstone river catchment with pbias 10 nse 0 92 and r2 0 94 during both calibration and validation periods furthermore the uncertainty analysis resulted in a p factor of 0 92 and an r factor of 0 50 for swat t calibration after four iterations while the p factor was 0 85 and the r factor was 0 50 for the validation period values for p factor of 0 7 and for r factor of about 1 the smaller the better are suggested for streamflow simulations abbaspour 2013 therefore swat t was judged to reasonably simulate streamflow and can be used for further analysis in the north johnstone river catchment furthermore results supplementary materials s2 showed that swat t simulated streamflow process better than default swat with larger r2 0 94 0 92 and 0 94 0 90 and nse 0 93 0 91 and 0 92 0 90 in the calibration and validation periods respectively using r2 and nse as statistical evaluation criteria to compare swat t and the original swat model is consistent with previous studies for instance ma et al 2019 integrated downscaled high quality modis lai into modified swat plant growth model and found that predicted flows with modis lai basically matched the observed flows better than original swat supported by an improvement of r2 and nse values however compared to swat t the default swat model produced smaller absolute percent bias 0 9 7 3 and 4 9 10 0 in the calibration and validation periods respectively this is most probably because both the default swat and the swat t model underestimated streamflow in the north johnstone river catchment according to fig 5 lai values simulated by swat t were much better and larger than the default swat this would lead to greater actual evapotranspiration simulated by swat t than the default swat table 5 leading to lower streamflow simulated by swat t table 5 therefore a larger absolute percent bias was produced by the swat t model however achieving good agreement between model simulation and observed streamflow through model calibration does not imply correct description of the underlying processes and parameterizations wagner et al 2011 because good streamflow simulations might be achieved by parameters calibration even with unrealistic underlying premises or without any improvement of the vegetation growth module strauch and volk 2013 therefore it is more reasonable to use the swat t model for land use impacts study as it successfully accounted for seasonal vegetation dynamics fig 5 which is an important part of the water cycle 4 2 modelled hydrological responses to different land use change scenarios the obvious monthly variations in surq latq gwq total runoff et and sw with values generally greater in december may summer autumn and less in june november winter spring fig 8 were consistent with the inter annual distribution of rainfall fig 2 this is because rainfall is the main factor affecting runoff et and soil water content fekete et al 2004 and the catchment that was selected is a summer rainfall dominant region meanwhile changes of surq under different land use scenarios differed across months with the most remarkable changes occurring during the wet season from december to may the impacts of vegetation changes on seasonal water yield with the largest volume changes occurred during the wet season and small volume changes during the dry season are consistent with previous studies brown et al 2005 total runoff is composed of surface runoff surq lateral runoff latq and groundwater gwq surface flow into rivers is mainly controlled by dominant climate conditions and is usually greatest during and shortly after storm or rain events groundwater i e baseflow is the major source of flow during the dry period brown et al 2015 lucc has been shown to be capable of altering baseflows and river discharges costa et al 2003 fig 8 and table 5 indicated that surface runoff increased under deforestation scenarios 1 and 2 and decreased under afforestation scenario 3 at monthly and annual time scales and is similar to previous studies foley et al 2005 this is because forest vegetation increases et rates dissipates raindrop energy slows surface flow velocity and increases soil organic matter all of which result in larger infiltration and smaller surface runoff alibuyog et al 2009 results presented in table 5 also showed that total runoff increased slightly under deforestation scenarios 1 and 2 and decreased slightly under afforestation scenario 3 at the annual time scale similar results for runoff response to lucc also occurred in other hydrological simulation studies for example weber et al 2001 found that streamflow simulated by hydrological models increased when forest area decreased and grassland area increased this is because trees commonly consume more water extracting water from shallow aquifer storage due to deep root systems and transpiring more due to larger aerodynamic conductance and therefore forest catchments will produce less runoff wang et al 2008 mwangi et al 2016 in contrast data shown in fig 8 and table 5 indicated that latq and gwq decreased while surq increased under urbanization scenarios 2 and 4 at monthly and annual time scales this decrease in latq and gwq under urbanization may be attributed to increased surface runoff and decreased infiltration as a result of conversion of vegetation land use to urban land use alibuyog et al 2009 additionally the rainfall runoff relationships in fig 10c h explain why runoff changes under urbanization generally produced more surq and less latq and gwq than frse and rnge with the same rainfall amounts in addition to runoff fig 8 and table 5 indicated that et decreased under deforestation scenarios 1 and 2 and increased under afforestation scenario 3 at monthly and annual time scales this is because forests generally produced more evapotranspiration than other land use types due to higher leaf area and deeper rooting depth costa et al 2003 li et al 2009 furthermore it can be seen from table 5 that soil water slightly increased 1 5 under deforestation scenario 1 11 5 increase in rnge area and slightly decreased 2 0 under afforestation scenario 3 14 1 increase in frse area at the annual time scale using swat t the greater infiltration for forest may lead to an increase in soil water compared with other vegetation but the larger evapotranspiration and water use may cause a decrease in soil water so that the overall change in soil water may be insignificant due to the counterbalancing effects of these two processes under deforestation and afforestation chen et al 2009 also reported that the effect of greater vegetation cover on soil moisture content was still debatable as it increased transpiration loss and rainfall interception whereas it decreased evaporation loss through shading hence dense vegetation cover reduces soil moisture because of larger transpiration and less rainfall falling on the ground due to greater interception by leaves in contrast the soil is shaded more by the greater canopy vegetation thereby reducing direct radiation absorption and leading to lower soil temperature and soil evaporation rates and higher soil moisture chen et al 2009 therefore the relationship between soil water and vegetation is complex and the positive or negative impacts of vegetation cover on soil moisture likely depend on climate and the length of dry or wet periods chen et al 2009 typically when forest canopy cover exceeds a certain threshold level the forest would produce less runoff and soil water but more et than other land cover types li et al 2009 hydrological responses to land use change scenarios using a default original swat model were shown in table 5 figs 9 10 and supplementary materials s3 using calibrated parameters from swat t model swat t showed greater simulated actual evapotranspiration et and lower streamflow surq latq gwq and total runoff than the default swat table 5 at annual time scale at monthly time scale seasonal dynamics of et and sw simulated by default swat supplementary materials s3 were slightly different from those simulated by swat t fig 8 while seasonal variability of other hydrological factors were similar in addition monthly changes of hydrological factors under different land use change scenarios simulated by default swat supplementary materials s3 were similar to that simulated by swat t fig 8 except for et and sw furthermore fig 9 showed that absolute total runoff changes simulated by default swat were much smaller than those from swat t in 33 different sub basins and may be explained by the smaller difference between annual rainfall and total runoff relationship for default swat model fig 10 b compared to swat t fig 10 a in general these differences were probably caused by the difference of seasonal lai simulated by swat t and default swat fig 5 4 3 limitations and uncertainties even though it met the criteria for satisfactory model performance similar to other swat model applications calibration and validation hydrograph fig 6 showed that most of the peak flows shrestha et al 2016 and low flows wu and johnston 2008 were underestimated in addition the model overestimated a few peaks during the dry period and underestimated it during the high flow period which also was the case for other australian catchments studied by saha et al 2014 this was an acceptable result considering the fact that the swat model was not calibrated for single event high streamflow condition saha et al 2014 furthermore low capacity to simulate both low flows and peak flows also occur in other hydrological models eum et al 2017 thus difficulties in reproducing peak flows and low flows are common due to the theories of hydrological models and standards of model calibration zhang et al 2019 however if the model has limited capacity to capture peak and low flows it does affect the extreme value of the surface runoff tessema et al 2014 if we quantify the impacts of different lucc scenarios on surface runoff with this kind of hydrological model it may underestimate or overestimate the magnitude of lucc effect however investigating the implications of peak flows and low flows underestimation or overestimation on the lucc effect analysis on the surface runoff are beyond the scope of our present study and needs to be explored in future studies the study also found that land use change had only a small effect on water balance components except surface runoff this is in line with findings reported in other studies shrestha et al 2017 for instance brown et al 2015 assessed the impact of forestry on streamflow in southeastern australia using swat and found that the modelled introduction of plantation forestry did not significantly change streamflow karlsson et al 2016 also pointed out that land use changes only affected the mean flow by a few percentage points this result may also be caused by our hypothetical land use scenarios where land use change area in each scenario accounted for 15 of the total catchment area in fact previous studies bosch and hewlett 1982 stednick 1996 stated that forest land changes of 15 20 do not influence the annual water yield besides the small effect found in this study may also be due to the partial conversion scenarios occurring mainly in the northwestern part of the catchment where there is less rainfall distribution compared to the downstream part the forest part of the catchment hence the implemented scenarios might not cause remarkable changes in the hydrological processes particularly at the annual scale in addition to land use scenarios a large number of uncertainty sources hydrological models calibration periods objective function etc may influence the impact analysis sources of uncertainty for the hydrological model can be present because of the model structure e g model assumptions and functions as well as input data e g lack of relevant temporal and spatial variability of data on rainfall land uses soils and topography marhaento et al 2018 another important issue is the calibration practices including calibration period and calibration approach van der spek and bakker 2017 wallach et al 2019 sorooshian et al 1983 claimed that it is not the length of data used but the information contained in it and the efficiency with which that information is extracted i e the choice of a stochastically appropriate objective function that are important parameterization of hydrological models is also a well known source of uncertainty and have been discussed previously a few times as related to impact studies karlsson et al 2016 however studying these additional sources of uncertainty is beyond the scope of this study and will be addressed in future research furthermore the current study was focused only on the north johnstone river catchment moreover even though this catchment was deemed to be representative of all such tropical catchments this study lacked replication at the catchment scale accordingly additional catchments will need to be chosen in future studies to stand for the large range of climate physical conditions and runoff characteristics throughout tropical australia and to afford insights for future water management 5 summary and conclusions the default original swat model has poor performance in estimating the lai of different vegetation types for tropical areas for the first time the swat t model strauch and volk 2013 with an improved vegetation growth module was used to analyze the hydrological sensitivity of a tropical catchment in australia under different land use change scenarios prior to the simulation of land use change scenarios the swat t model was parameterized calibrated and validated with nse 0 59 nse 0 for default swat r2 0 70 r2 0 66 for default swat and pbias 2 5 pbias 42 for default swat for lai and nse 0 92 nse 0 90 for default swat r2 0 94 r2 0 90 for default swat and pbias 10 pbias 5 for default swat for streamflow therefore the swat t model was judged to perform satisfactorily in this catchment according to general performance indices overall the swat t model performed better in predicting monthly streamflow than the default swat model based on our major statistical indicators in an australian tropical catchment for the first time we used both models swat t and default swat to quantify hydrological responses to land use change scenarios in the selected tropical catchment results showed that lucc affected all hydrological variables of which the impact on surface runoff was the most remarkable at both monthly and annual time scales moreover changes of surq under different land use scenarios differed across months using swat t with the most obvious changes occurring during the wet season from december to may and similar results can be found for default swat the simulations also indicated that urbanization converting frse or rnge to urbn resulted in increased surface flow and decreased lateral flow and groundwater with no notable change in total runoff et and sw using swat t for instance surface runoff increased 16 mm 5 7 with a 2 3 increase in urbn area and 44 mm 15 9 with an 8 4 increase in urbn area the decreases of latq and gwq under urbanization were 3 5 while the impact of urbanization on total runoff et and sw were 0 7 additionally afforestation scenario 3 14 1 increase in frse area decreased surq by 26 mm 9 5 and led to slight changes in other hydrological variables within 2 0 annual rainfall and total runoff were strongly positively correlated r 0 94 for frse rnge and urbn and frse generally produced less total runoff than rnge and urbn for the same rainfall amounts furthermore urbn generally produced more surq and less latq and gwq than frse and rnge for the same rainfall amounts as shown in the scatter diagrams of rainfall runoff relationships fig 10 furthermore we found that swat t showed greater simulated actual evapotranspiration et and lower streamflow surq latq gwq and total runoff than the default swat at annual time scale in contrast at a monthly scale seasonal dynamics of et and sw simulated by default swat were slightly different from those simulated by swat t while seasonal variability of other hydrological factors were similar these differences can be attributed to the diversity of seasonal lai simulated by swat t and default swat therefore we conclude that using swat t is more reasonable in tropical catchments as it captures seasonal vegetation dynamics the remarkable increase in surface runoff from deforestation and urbanization can threaten the health of both people and the biosphere for instance urbanization has enlarged impermeable surface area increased runoff coefficient reduced concentration time and increased peak flow and frequency of floods in city rivers yaa et al 2012 in addition increased surface runoff will carry a large amount of sediment and pollutants degrading river ecosystems and for this particular catchment thereby threatening the health of the great barrier reef as the north johnstone river is a key tributary that discharges into the great barrier reef lagoon strategies to ameliorate the effects of land use change include increasing green space in urban areas to reduce runoff foley et al 2005 reducing nutrient and sediment inputs improving the management of drainage systems and others the results of studies such as reported here will provide important information for developing sustainable management of water resources in tropical eastern australia the research methods described in this study can be further extended to other

5580,land use change is one of the dominant driving factors of watershed hydrological change thus hydrological responses to land use changes require detailed assessments to ensure sustainable management of both water resources and natural ecosystems the soil and water assessment tool swat model has been widely used to simulate the impacts of land use change on water balance however the original swat model has poor performance in estimating the leaf area index lai of different vegetation types for tropical areas the objective of this study was to simulate the impact of different land use change scenarios deforestation afforestation and urbanization on the water balance using an improved swat model with vegetation growth calibrated from modis lai data the north johnstone river catchment in wet tropical eastern australia was selected as the case study area results showed that the modified swat model was able to reproduce smoothed modis lai with nse 0 59 nse 0 for default swat r2 0 70 r2 0 66 for default swat and pbias 2 5 pbias 42 for default swat and to predict monthly streamflow well with nse 0 92 nse 0 90 for default swat r2 0 94 r2 0 90 for default swat it is noted that swat t had pbias 10 while pbias 5 for default swat land use change impacted all hydrological variables with the impact on surface runoff being the most notable at yearly scale 8 9 5 7 9 5 and 15 9 for scenario 1 2 3 and 4 respectively absolute changes of surface runoff under land use change scenarios differed across months with the most notable absolute change occurring during the wet season december to may 1 2 6 6 mm 1 0 3 5 mm 7 3 1 1 mm and 3 0 9 0 mm for scenario 1 2 3 and 4 respectively urbanization increased surface runoff 5 7 and 15 9 for scenario 2 and 4 respectively and decreased lateral runoff 0 7 and 1 3 and groundwater 0 9 and 3 5 but produced no clear change in total runoff 0 2 and 0 2 actual evapotranspiration 0 3 and 0 3 and soil water 0 5 and 0 7 at the annual time scale furthermore afforestation could decrease surface runoff 9 5 for scenario 3 and soil water 2 0 increase evapotranspiration 1 7 and lead to slight changes absolute values 0 8 in other hydrological variables at the annual time scale a strong positive correlation r 0 94 was observed between annual rainfall and total runoff for forest evergreen range grasses and urban land use forest evergreen generally produced less total runoff than range grasses and urban land use under conditions of the same rainfall terrain slope and soil texture in addition urban land use generally produced more surface runoff and less lateral runoff and groundwater than forest evergreen and range grasses under the same conditions these results contribute important information for development of

interactions and biodiversity loss and is a major factor influencing sustainable development turner et al 1995 lucc can directly affect global carbon budgets biodiversity and ecosystem function aide et al 2013 many regions worldwide have experienced massive lucc over recent decades schirpke et al 2012 although the net decrease of natural forest area was slowing down globally in the period from 2000 to 2010 meyfroidt and lambin 2011 deforestation remains one of the major processes of lucc with multiple implications for global environmental change lambin and geist 2008 for example a large amount of natural land in china including wetlands and forests has been developed into arable land and human settlements due to rapid urbanization over the past two decades song and ding 2009 yu et al 2011 extensive deforestation occurred in latin america and the caribbean during the first decade of the 21st century but extensive areas also recovered woody vegetation 360 000 km2 across the region aide et al 2013 about 30 of total forest land is under pressure from rapid lucc in northeast india which is one of the recognized global biodiversity hotspots lele and joshi 2009 since 1990 australia s plantation area has increased by around 700 000 ha parsons et al 2007 the extensive lucc in australia along with agricultural development has induced an instability in the water cycle leading to increased land and water salinization over massive areas zhang et al 2001 in the study of hydrological responses to lucc forest hydrological effects have attracted much attention especially the impacts of afforestation and deforestation most results have shown that catchment runoff decreased significantly after afforestation and increased obviously after deforestation li et al 2012 for example crosbie et al 2007 concluded that runoff was significantly reduced in five years after the land use of annual cropping and pastures changed to tree belts with perennial pastures in a small agricultural catchment in central nsw australia chen and yu 2015 assessed likely impacts of two lucc scenarios in southeast queensland and found that extreme lucc would significantly affect flooding in rural catchments but not in urbanized catchments the importance of water in both nature and society emphasizes the necessity for greater understanding how lucc could influence regional streamflow regimes there are three main methods used to quantitatively analyze the impacts of lucc on hydrology and water resources 1 the paired catchment experimental method bosch and hewlett 1982 2 the time series analysis method li et al 2012 and 3 the hydrological model method mwangi et al 2016 in the paired catchment experimental method two catchments with similar areas shapes climate vegetation and soil are selected and observed generally the first 3 5 years preferably including a wet year a normal year and a dry year are the control period with no experimental measures after that the land use cover of one of the catchments will be artificially changed while other conditions remain the same the other catchment remains in the original state and is referred to as the reference catchment after an observation period the runoff in the two experimental catchments is compared and analyzed and the impacts of lucc on water quantity are quantitatively analyzed the paired catchment experimental method is generally considered to be the best way to compensate for climate variability in small catchments but the method is difficult to apply to catchments other than small ones as finding two similar medium or large catchments is difficult also even similar catchments may change significantly at different stages li et al 2009 the second method the time series analysis method can be used to analyze the changing trend of hydrologic and climatic data but the spatial heterogeneity of a catchment and the mechanisms of lucc and climate change on the water cycle cannot be determined since the 1970s with the development of computer science geographic information systems and remote sensing technologies hydrological models have been more widely used to determine lucc impacts in water cycle studies hydrological models provide a framework for conceptualizing and studying the relationships among climate change land use change and the water cycle among these models distributed hydrological models have significant applications because they directly relate model parameters to characteristics of the earth s surface legesse et al 2003 therefore determining how to construct a distributed hydrological model to study the hydrological response to lucc is a question that must be researched in depth swat soil and water assessment tool is a semi distributed and physically based watershed scale hydrological model developed by arnold et al 1998 at the usda ars it simulates long term hydrological variables e g streamflow at a daily time scale brown et al 2015 swat is considered to be one of the most appropriate models for assessing hydrological responses water sediment and nutrient loss to land use change in watersheds with different land use soils and management conditions arnold and fohrer 2005 in general managing vegetation growth is necessary in distributed hydrological models because evapotranspiration is an important component of the water cycle abbaspour et al 2015 a simple plant growth model is used in swat to simulate growth and yield of all kinds of vegetation abbaspour et al 2015 the plant growth model in swat was developed for temperate areas and is not suitable for monsoon driven or tropical regions wagner et al 2011 for instance the day length driven dormancy used in temperate areas to separate annual plant cycles is not consistent with plant growth in the tropics therefore the model s suitability to simulate plant growth has not been reflected critically in most swat research for tropical areas possibly because model calibration and validation are normally based on streamflow and or water quality outputs strauch and volk 2013 however successfully reproducing these outputs does not imply a correct simulation of the internal hydrological processes in a catchment strauch and volk 2013 therefore a few studies have been conducted to improve the plant growth model in swat globally including tropical areas strauch and volk 2013 alemayehu et al 2017 guo et al 2019 ma et al 2019 for instance strauch and volk 2013 presented an alternative approach to automatically trigger new growing seasons during the transition from dry to wet season based on changes in soil moisture for tropical areas meanwhile a general improvement independent of whether or not the area is in tropics has been implemented with the lai decline rate modified to a logistic function which provides a sigmoidal decrease toward the minimum lai their results showed that the modified plant growth model could reasonably represent seasonal dynamics of the lai and the modified model should be useful for large parts of the model community alemayehu et al 2017 modified the swat model for the tropics using a straightforward but robust soil moisture index a quotient of rainfall and reference evapotranspiration to trigger a new growth cycle within a predefined period and results indicated that this index was reliable for triggering a new annual growth cycle in addition ma et al 2019 integrated downscaled high quality modis lai into modified swat plant growth model and reported a high accuracy in the validation of streamflow in the subtropics however to the best of our knowledge the swat model with an improved plant growth model has never before been applied to tropical regions of australia consequently we selected a catchment representative of the tropics in australia to explore and assess the performance of the modified swat swat t model as improved by strauch and volk 2013 the aim is to evaluate the performance of swat t and to assess hydrological responses to land use cover change in wet tropical australia we selected the north johnstone river catchment as a case study the specific objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the performance of the swat t and default swat model for simulating leaf area index lai and streamflow of the north johnstone river catchment 2 using both models swat t and default swat to forecast changes in simulated surface runoff lateral runoff groundwater total runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil water under different land use change scenarios and 3 identify rainfall runoff relationships of different land covers to explain water availability changes caused by land use cover change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the north johnstone river catchment fig 1 is situated in the wet tropics of north queensland the catchment area is about 924 km2 with elevation ranging from 18 m to 1370 m in this catchment the mean annual temperature is about 21 4 c mean annual rainfall is approximately 2740 mm and mean annual runoff is about 1995 mm averaged from 1967 to 2017 rainfall is affected by monsoons and tropical cyclones lows depressions and is strongly seasonal with 78 of the total annual rainfall occurring during the wet season from december to may fig 2 the catchment also receives regular rainfall throughout the year in contrast to dry tropical areas the johnstone river catchment is divided into three distinct regions the upper tablelands or hinterland the central the range or world heritage and the lower coastal or floodplain regions the two key tributaries that discharge into the great barrier reef lagoon are the north johnstone and south johnstone rivers the other major streams are the moresby river liverpool creek and maria creek these three streams are lowland waterways whereas the north and south johnstone rivers begin in the upland mixed land use tablelands agriculture residential and industrial developments including roads can have important impacts on the way water flows through the landscape https wetlandinfo des qld gov au wetlands facts maps sub basin north johnstone river thus understanding how land use cover changes influence regional streamflow regimes is essential for deciding how best to manage the catchment and to protect its resources 2 2 the swat model the swat hydrological model swat 2012 is used to represent the main hydrological processes within the catchment swat is a process based and semi distributed hydrological model that simulates the major water balance components continuously at a daily time step arnold et al 1998 swat can simulate watershed hydrological characteristics under different land use and climate conditions making it a widely used hydrology related tool for land use and climate change research li et al 2011 reshmidevi et al 2017 shrestha et al 2017 however examples from tropical australia are limited with most studies concentrated in the eastern and southeastern part of the country saha and zeleke 2015 the model was selected based on considerations such as its ability to represent the physical processes related to water movement support documentation and additional software swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty programs for model calibration and validation the hargreaves method available in the swat interface was used to calculate potential evapotranspiration reshmidevi et al 2017 using air temperature as input data brown et al 2015 in this study surface runoff and infiltration is computed with daily rainfall using the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method usda 1972 further model details can be found in neitsch et al 2011 however the original swat model performs poorly in estimating lai of different vegetation types for tropical areas thus an improved swat model swat t strauch and volk 2013 was used in this study this approach used simulated plant available water in the upper soil layers as a trigger for a new growing cycle in the swat t model two new parameters tramo1 and tramo2 were implemented to define the first and the last month of a region specific transition period from dry to wet season in this study based on the modis lai the default values of tramo1 and tramo2 were set to 7 july and 8 august in the sub basin input files respectively in addition for this swat t model a logistic function that provides a sigmoidal decrease towards the minimum lai was used to modify the lai decline rate further model details can be found in strauch and volk 2013 according to the user s manual from strauch and volk 2013 no management settings in the operations schedule were defined for the swat t model in this study furthermore the swat t model was calibrated and validated only against streamflow the model simulations were not calibrated and validated with actual evapotranspiration and soil water content due to a lack of field data for these variables the absolute values of actual evapotranspiration and soil water content should therefore not be used directly however comparing the relative changes in the simulations is still reasonable and valuable because the hydrological model mimics the actual water cycle 2 3 data preparation multiple data sets are required in swat as input to develop a semi distributed model using the arcswat interface this section describes the processing of the respective data the data for swat model development data sources and relevant characteristics are listed in table 1 2 3 1 digital elevation model dem land use and soil data swat

depth of the soil profile moist bulk density etc for different soil layers are required by the swat model saha et al 2014 we clipped the soil map for the north johnstone river catchment from the digital atlas of australian soil fig 3b based on the available references and lookup tables mckenzie et al 2000 western and mckenzie 2004 saha et al 2014 we created a usersoil database table to delineate hru in swat for the north johnstone river catchment 2 3 2 climate data and river discharge daily maximum temperature minimum temperature and rainfall from 1967 to 2017 at 10 climate stations fig 1 within or near the catchment were collected from the australian government bureau of meteorology bom website http www bom gov au climate data these climate data were used for driving swat model simulations according to the default setting in swat one climate station was assigned to each sub basin which was closest to sub basin s centroid sirisena et al 2018 for streamflow calibration and validation daily observed discharge at the tung oil gauge fig 1 also were collected from the australian government bom website http www bom gov au waterdata for streamflow calibration a calibration period that includes wet normal and dry years was selected so that the model parameters were set for a wide range of climate conditions and also for the validation period accordingly daily observed streamflow data for the periods of 2008 2017 2005 2007 as warm up and 2003 2007 2000 2002 as warm up were used for streamflow calibration and validation respectively whereas daily observed climatic and hydrological data for the 1967 2017 period were used to assess land use change impacts on water availability with the calibrated swat t model to be consistent with the calibration and validation periods for streamflow the same periods were used for lai calibration and validation 2 3 3 leaf area index it was found that the default swat model could not well reflect the dynamics of lai therefore swat simulated lai was calibrated to modis derived four day lai composites using the swat t model strauch and volk 2013 for tropical plant growth this swat t model has been shown to improve the representation of shifts between plant dormancy and growth in tropics by using soil moisture rather than day length to represent crucial phenological thresholds strauch and volk 2013 a 4 day composite mcd15a3h v6 lai dataset with 500 m pixel size was used in this study for each of the land cover classes 4 day median lai time series were extracted from 2003 to 2017 using methods according to previous studies strauch and volk 2013 alemayehu et al 2017 in addition the bfast method verbesselt et al 2010 was used to smooth the 4 day raw median lai time series for different land use covers see supplementary materials s1 hoyos et al 2019 since lai was hru related outputs we derived the area weighted hru mean for comparison with the smoothed median modis lai strauch and volk 2013 and calibrated the lai parameters manually additionally we aggregated daily simulated lai to 4 day scale to calibrate lai parameters using a trial and error process such that the swat t simulated 4 day lai mimicked the modis 4 day lai according to the smoothed lai data supplementary materials s1 agrl and wetl had maximum lai values 2 4 in march and minimum values 1 8 and 1 9 in july and august respectively frse and frsd peaked in october 6 0 and 5 3 and february 5 3 and 5 1 and reached minimum values 3 7 and 4 0 in june rngb and rnge had maximum lai values 3 5 and 2 4 in february and reached minimum values 2 9 and 2 0 in july the high values of smoothed lai were generally observed during the wet season december to may supplementary materials s1 which indicated consistency in the smoothed lai time series thus the plant growth module in the swat t model was calibrated and validated using the smoothed lai time series alemayehu et al 2017 2 4 model calibration and evaluation approach swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup a standalone computer program developed for calibration validation and uncertainty analysis of swat was used to optimize swat model parameters abbaspour 2013 swat cup links five different calibration procedures which are sequential uncertainty fitting ver 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2007 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 particle swarm optimization pso zhang et al 2015 parameter solution parasol van griensven and bauwens 2003 and markov chain monte carlo mcmc marshall et al 2004 the program sufi 2 was selected in this study for swat t calibration validation and uncertainty analysis because it was found to be quite efficient for time consuming large scale models yang et al 2008 two types of sensitivity analysis methods are allowed in the sufi 2 program global sensitivity method and one at a time sensitivity analysis method abbaspour 2013 the global sensitivity analysis method was used to rank the sensitivity of 22 parameters in swat t in this sensitivity analysis method the smaller the p value and the larger the absolute value of t stat the more sensitive the parameter is abbaspour 2013 uncertainty in sufi 2 parameters conveyed as ranges uniform distributions accounts for total sources of uncertainties like uncertainty in driving variables e g rainfall observed data conceptual models and parameters abbaspour 2013 propagation of the parameter uncertainties results in uncertainties in the swat model output variables which are manifested as the 95 probability distributions abbaspour 2013 these are computed at 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution of model output variables produced by the propagation of the uncertainties in parameters using latin hypercube sampling abbaspour 2013 this is called the 95 prediction uncertainty i e 95ppu two statistics p factor and r factor were created to quantify the fit between simulation results 95ppu and observation data with its error abbaspour et al 2015 the p factor is the proportion of observed data enveloped by the simulation results the 95ppu while the r factor is the breadth of the 95ppu envelope monthly observed and simulated discharge for the period of 2008 2017 and 2003 2007 were used for swat t calibration and validation respectively the results for water balance components all were presented at a monthly or annual time step therefore calibrating discharge at a monthly time step rather than daily time step makes the calculation process faster and more efficient monthly streamflow was calibrated with sufi 2 using 500 simulations per iteration 4 iterations by maximizing the value of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 in this study we followed shi et al 2011 by using nse percent bias pbias and coefficient of determination r2 as statistical evaluation criteria nse is one of the most commonly used standards for comparing simulations of hydrological models with observed data le and pricope 2017 nse values vary from to 1 with a value of 1 indicates that the model simulated results and observed data are perfectly matched hence the closer the nse is to 1 the better performance the swat model will have pbias evaluates the average trend of the model simulations to be greater or less than their observed counterparts a positive value of pbias demonstrates an overestimation bias while a negative value indicates an underestimation shi et al 2011 therefore the smaller the absolute value of pbias the better nse pbias and r2 were calculated as follows 1 pbias 100 i 1 n q sim i q obs i i 1 n q obs i 2 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 3 r 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs q sim i q sim 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 i 1 n q sim i q sim 2 where q obs and q sim are the observed and swat t model simulated monthly streamflow m3 s respectively q obs and q sim are the mean observed and swat t model simulated monthly streamflow m3 s respectively n is the number of samples and i is the ith sample 2 5 different land use scenarios the most common land cover classes of the north johnstone river catchment were frse forest evergreen and rnge range grasses which accounted for around 63 7 of the total region to evaluate the hydrological response to land use changes in the catchment four scenarios table 2 were considered these changes were achieved by using the land use update tool in the arcswat interface at the sub basin scale marhaento et al 2017 for instance frse can be considered to be replaced by rnge only if both land use types exist in the same sub basin shrestha et al 2017 therefore these partial conversion scenarios mainly occurred in the northwestern part of the catchment where there is less rainfall distribution compared to the downstream part the forest part of the catchment fig 3 scenario 1 supposes that all current frse will be changed to rnge while the rest of the land covers will remain unchanged this means an 11 5 increase in rnge area over the entire catchment scenario 2 supposes that all current frse will be converted to urbn representing a 2 3 increase in urbn area over the entire catchment scenario 3 supposes that all current rnge will be changed to frse representing a 14 1 increase in frse area over the entire catchment scenario 4 supposes that all current rnge will be converted to urbn representing an 8 4 increase in urbn area over the entire catchment these four land use change scenarios i e deforestation deforestation urbanization afforestation and urbanization were on the basis of present land use conditions and potential future land use plans residential development in the north johnstone river catchment wang et al 2008 the land use change scenarios are shown in table 2 and the percentage areas of the four scenarios are shown in fig 4 frst was classified as frsd in fig 4 because of its small area proportion shown in fig 3 3 results 3 1 swat t lai calibration table 3 presents the calibrated values for lai which were adjusted using a manual calibration method the minimum lai alai min for each land use was defined according to long term modis lai as suggested by strauch and volk 2013 the total number of heat units needed to bring plants to maturity phu plt was calculated using the long term daily mean temperature the shape coefficients frgw1 frgw2 laimx1 laimx2 and dlai for the lai curve and the remaining parameters were calibrated by a trial and error process to ensure that the lai simulated by swat t mimicked the smoothed modis lai the calibrated values and calibration methods for each lai parameter and each land use are shown in table 3 the lai parameters of frst were not calibrated because of the small area proportion in the catchment thus the lai parameters of frsd was used for frst fig 5 shows the comparison between 4 day smoothed modis lai with the swat t simulated lai using calibrated parameters for the different vegetation types in both the calibration and validation periods the degree of agreement for modis and simulated lai were assessed both qualitatively visual comparisons and quantitatively statistical evaluations from a visual comparison it is clear that the plant growth cycles of the different vegetation types simulated by the swat t model corresponded much better with the modis lai data than the default swat results for instance the minimum lai values simulated by the swat t model 1 8 4 0 3 7 2 9 2 0 and 1 9 were similar to the modis lai 1 8 4 0 3 7 2 9 2 0 and 1 9 for agrl frsd frse rngb rnge and wetl respectively while the minimum lai simulated by the default swat was zero for all types of vegetation covers fig 5 also provides the values of the statistical evaluation indices used to assess the performance of swat t simulated lai for frse which was the dominant land cover in the catchment the swat t model performed quite well for lai with the values of nse 0 79 during the calibration and validation periods in contrast calibration and validation performance for wetl and rnge was low when the nse values were 0 59 however r2 values were higher than nse values for all plants types during calibration and validation ranging from 0 70 to 0 91 and pbias values were always within a reasonably small range 2 5 indicating overall good model performance 3 2 discharge calibration and validation the 22 parameters were calibrated and ranked for the discharge calibration in the swat t model in the north johnstone river catchment table 4 these parameters were ranked according to their sensitivities using the global sensitivity analysis method the sensitivity analysis in swat cup suggested that 10 parameters ranked 1 10 table 4 had significant influence on calibration p 0 05 groundwater delay gw delay was found to be the most sensitive calibration parameter in the north johnstone river catchment fig 6 shows the monthly swat t simulated streamflow compared with the observed streamflow during calibration and validation periods visual comparison showed the simulated hydrograph reproduced the observations reasonably well and closely replicated the temporal variation fig 7 shows that monthly observed runoff and the swat t simulated runoff were highly correlated r2 0 94 nse 0 92 and pbias 10 with slopes within 15 of the 1 1 regression during the calibration and validation periods in the north johnstone river catchment furthermore a comparison of swat t and the default swat model was shown in supplementary materials s2 and results showed that swat t simulated streamflow process better than default swat with larger r2 0 94 0 92 and 0 94 0 90 and nse 0 93 0 91 and 0 92 0 90 in calibration and validation period respectively however compared to swat t the default swat model produced smaller absolute percent bias 0 9 7 3 and 4 9 10 0 in calibration and validation period respectively 3 3 hydrological responses to land use change scenarios the calibrated swat t model was applied to simulate the monthly surface runoff surq lateral runoff latq groundwater gwq total runoff actual evapotranspiration et and soil water sw under the four land use change scenarios in 1967 2017 in the north johnstone river catchment fig 8 shows monthly surq latq gwq total runoff et and sw and their changes under different land use scenarios and table 5 summarizes changes in average annual surq latq gwq total runoff et and sw under different land use scenarios it can be seen from fig 8 that surq latq gwq total runoff et and sw had obvious monthly variations with values generally greater in december may summer autumn and less in june november winter spring in addition fig 8 shows that monthly changes among different land use scenarios of surq were more notable than changes of other outputs from swat t meanwhile absolute changes of surq under different land use scenarios differed across months with the most remarkable changes occurring during the wet season from december to may furthermore fig 8 indicates that monthly surq increased under scenarios 1 2 and 4 deforestation or urbanization and decreased under scenario 3 afforestation and similar results can be found for default swat supplementary materials s3 this result was the same for surq at the annual time scale table 5 table 5 indicates that the mean annual surface runoff increased under deforestation scenarios 1 and 2 and urbanization scenarios 2 and 4 for example surface runoff increased 25 mm 8 9 under scenario 1 11 5 decrease in frse area 16 mm 5 7 under scenario 2 2 3 increase in urbn area and 44 mm 15 9 under scenario 4 8 4 increase in urbn area using swat t in contrast the 14 1 increase in frse area scenario 3 led to a 26 mm 9 5 decrease in surface runoff the annual total runoff also increased under deforestation and urbanization and decreased under afforestation but the extent of increase and decrease was much smaller than observed for surface runoff for instance table 5 indicates that total runoff increased by just 11 mm 0 6 under scenario 1 11 5 decrease in frse area and decreased 14 mm 0 7 under scenario 3 14 1 increase in frse area using swat t however annual changes of latq and gwq to urbanization scenarios 2 and 4 were opposite to those of surq and total runoff as shown in table 5 latq and gwq decreased under urbanization for example a 2 3 increase in urbn area scenario 2 led to 0 7 and 0 9 decreases in latq and gwq respectively while an 8 4 increase in urbn area scenario 4 contributed to 1 3 and 3 5 decreases in latq and gwq respectively in addition to runoff table 5 also shows the swat t simulated changes in average annual actual evapotranspiration and soil water under the four scenarios results show that mean annual et decreased by 11 mm 1 3 with an 11 5 reduction in forest area scenario 1 and increased by 14 mm 1 7 with a 14 1 increase in frse area scenario 3 using swat t that is under the deforestation scenario scenario 1 the mean annual et declined with decreased forest area and under the afforestation scenario scenario 3 the mean annual et increased with increased forest area in addition table 5 suggests that the change of soil water in different land use scenarios was opposite to et with a 1 5 increase under deforestation scenario 1 and a 2 0 decrease under afforestation scenario 3 according to table 5 changes in average annual total runoff under scenarios 1 and 3 were more remarkable than under scenarios 2 and 4 the spatial distributions of average annual total runoff under land use scenario 0 and average annual total runoff change under scenarios 1 and 3 compared with scenario 0 using swat t and default swat in different sub basins in the north johnstone river catchment are shown in fig 9 these spatial distributions show that average annual runoff in the eastern sub basins of the catchment were generally greater than those in the western sub basins this was primarily due to the uneven spatial distribution of rainfall with higher rainfall occurring in the eastern area and lower rainfall in the western area compared with scenario 0 average annual runoff increased in scenario 1 under an 11 5 reduction in frse area in some sub basins 4 7 9 10 14 15 19 20 24 28 and 30 while it decreased in scenario 3 under a 14 1 increase in frse area in the same sub basins the reason why changes of average annual runoff occur only in these sub basins is that the replacement of one land use by another land use can be considered only if both land uses are present in the same sub basin as we described in the materials and methods section furthermore fig 9 showed that absolute total runoff changes simulated by default swat were much smaller than that by swat t in 33 different sub basins to quantify the impacts of land use change on rainfall runoff relationships scatter diagrams between annual rainfall and runoff total runoff surq latq and gwq for frse rnge and urbn were plotted fig 10 using the simulated results from swat t and default swat in 1967 2017 from selected hrus hru 30 for frse hru 41 for rnge and hru 52 for urbn in sub basin 4 fig 10a b revealed strong positive correlations r 0 94 between annual rainfall and total runoff for frse rnge and urbn fig 10a b also showed that the plotted cluster of points for frse were generally higher than the rnge and urbn points indicating that frse generally produced less runoff than rnge and urbn under the same rainfall amounts this explains the changes in average annual total runoff in table 5 scenarios 1 2 and 3 and implies that rainfall runoff relationships could be altered by land use changes furthermore fig 10c h indicated that urbn generally produced more surq and less latq and gwq than frse and rnge under the same rainfall amounts 4 discussion 4 1 model comparison and evaluation it was found that in the default plant growth model of swat simulated lai was zero for all plants at the beginning of each simulation year which is not true for plants in tropical areas previous studies mwangi et al 2016 alemayehu et al 2017 hoyos et al 2019 reported similar simulations revealing that the default swat has some shortcomings in modelling vegetation growth in tropical regions while the calibrated swat t model was generally able to replicate bfast filtered modis lai values for each land cover type fig 5 it failed to represent the bimodal seasonality of lai because the model is capable of simulating only one wet dry transition within a year hoyos et al 2019 however the default swat lai mean values failed to correctly represent both lai seasonality and range for all plants fig 5 moreover the precision of modis lai is also very important because it is directly used to calibrate the parameters of hydrological models the average lai of 4 85 average of maximum lai 6 0 and minimum lai 3 7 for frse the dominant land cover in the study area was approximately equal to values previously reported 4 71 0 37 in the literature hill et al 2006 for tropical rainforests across australia overall the lai results simulated by the swat t model were acceptable groundwater delay gw delay was found to be the most sensitive calibration parameter in the north johnstone river catchment table 4 in addition half of the parameters identified as sensitive p 0 05 had an impact on either soil moisture or groundwater flow this may be due to the abundance of groundwater in this area fig 8 and table 5 so the flow in this catchment was dominated by baseflow the baseflow ratio was about 0 44 calculated by gwq total runoff during july 2005 to june 2013 in this study and it was consistent with previous research orr et al 2014 in which the mean daily baseflow was 31 579 m3 s i e baseflow ratio was 0 47 from 1 july 2005 to 1 july 2013 previous studies mcmahon and finlayson 2003 brown et al 2015 also reported that australia s perennial rivers were dominated by baseflow swat parameters associated with baseflow and soil moisture were consistently identified as being highly sensitive to calibration by a review of swat applications gassman et al 2007 supporting the results and suggesting that model operators should focus on these parameters during calibration to guarantee that the swat model is conceptually consistent with regional hydrological conditions according to the general performance ratings suggested by previous studies moriasi et al 2007 shi et al 2011 wallace et al 2018 streamflow modelling is deemed reasonable if nse 0 50 r2 0 50 and pbias within 25 therefore it was shown that the swat t model simulated monthly streamflow well in the north johnstone river catchment with pbias 10 nse 0 92 and r2 0 94 during both calibration and validation periods furthermore the uncertainty analysis resulted in a p factor of 0 92 and an r factor of 0 50 for swat t calibration after four iterations while the p factor was 0 85 and the r factor was 0 50 for the validation period values for p factor of 0 7 and for r factor of about 1 the smaller the better are suggested for streamflow simulations abbaspour 2013 therefore swat t was judged to reasonably simulate streamflow and can be used for further analysis in the north johnstone river catchment furthermore results supplementary materials s2 showed that swat t simulated streamflow process better than default swat with larger r2 0 94 0 92 and 0 94 0 90 and nse 0 93 0 91 and 0 92 0 90 in the calibration and validation periods respectively using r2 and nse as statistical evaluation criteria to compare swat t and the original swat model is consistent with previous studies for instance ma et al 2019 integrated downscaled high quality modis lai into modified swat plant growth model and found that predicted flows with modis lai basically matched the observed flows better than original swat supported by an improvement of r2 and nse values however compared to swat t the default swat model produced smaller absolute percent bias 0 9 7 3 and 4 9 10 0 in the calibration and validation periods respectively this is most probably because both the default swat and the swat t model underestimated streamflow in the north johnstone river catchment according to fig 5 lai values simulated by swat t were much better and larger than the default swat this would lead to greater actual evapotranspiration simulated by swat t than the default swat table 5 leading to lower streamflow simulated by swat t table 5 therefore a larger absolute percent bias was produced by the swat t model however achieving good agreement between model simulation and observed streamflow through model calibration does not imply correct description of the underlying processes and parameterizations wagner et al 2011 because good streamflow simulations might be achieved by parameters calibration even with unrealistic underlying premises or without any improvement of the vegetation growth module strauch and volk 2013 therefore it is more reasonable to use the swat t model for land use impacts study as it successfully accounted for seasonal vegetation dynamics fig 5 which is an important part of the water cycle 4 2 modelled hydrological responses to different land use change scenarios the obvious monthly variations in surq latq gwq total runoff et and sw with values generally greater in december may summer autumn and less in june november winter spring fig 8 were consistent with the inter annual distribution of rainfall fig 2 this is because rainfall is the main factor affecting runoff et and soil water content fekete et al 2004 and the catchment that was selected is a summer rainfall dominant region meanwhile changes of surq under different land use scenarios differed across months with the most remarkable changes occurring during the wet season from december to may the impacts of vegetation changes on seasonal water yield with the largest volume changes occurred during the wet season and small volume changes during the dry season are consistent with previous studies brown et al 2005 total runoff is composed of surface runoff surq lateral runoff latq and groundwater gwq surface flow into rivers is mainly controlled by dominant climate conditions and is usually greatest during and shortly after storm or rain events groundwater i e baseflow is the major source of flow during the dry period brown et al 2015 lucc has been shown to be capable of altering baseflows and river discharges costa et al 2003 fig 8 and table 5 indicated that surface runoff increased under deforestation scenarios 1 and 2 and decreased under afforestation scenario 3 at monthly and annual time scales and is similar to previous studies foley et al 2005 this is because forest vegetation increases et rates dissipates raindrop energy slows surface flow velocity and increases soil organic matter all of which result in larger infiltration and smaller surface runoff alibuyog et al 2009 results presented in table 5 also showed that total runoff increased slightly under deforestation scenarios 1 and 2 and decreased slightly under afforestation scenario 3 at the annual time scale similar results for runoff response to lucc also occurred in other hydrological simulation studies for example weber et al 2001 found that streamflow simulated by hydrological models increased when forest area decreased and grassland area increased this is because trees commonly consume more water extracting water from shallow aquifer storage due to deep root systems and transpiring more due to larger aerodynamic conductance and therefore forest catchments will produce less runoff wang et al 2008 mwangi et al 2016 in contrast data shown in fig 8 and table 5 indicated that latq and gwq decreased while surq increased under urbanization scenarios 2 and 4 at monthly and annual time scales this decrease in latq and gwq under urbanization may be attributed to increased surface runoff and decreased infiltration as a result of conversion of vegetation land use to urban land use alibuyog et al 2009 additionally the rainfall runoff relationships in fig 10c h explain why runoff changes under urbanization generally produced more surq and less latq and gwq than frse and rnge with the same rainfall amounts in addition to runoff fig 8 and table 5 indicated that et decreased under deforestation scenarios 1 and 2 and increased under afforestation scenario 3 at monthly and annual time scales this is because forests generally produced more evapotranspiration than other land use types due to higher leaf area and deeper rooting depth costa et al 2003 li et al 2009 furthermore it can be seen from table 5 that soil water slightly increased 1 5 under deforestation scenario 1 11 5 increase in rnge area and slightly decreased 2 0 under afforestation scenario 3 14 1 increase in frse area at the annual time scale using swat t the greater infiltration for forest may lead to an increase in soil water compared with other vegetation but the larger evapotranspiration and water use may cause a decrease in soil water so that the overall change in soil water may be insignificant due to the counterbalancing effects of these two processes under deforestation and afforestation chen et al 2009 also reported that the effect of greater vegetation cover on soil moisture content was still debatable as it increased transpiration loss and rainfall interception whereas it decreased evaporation loss through shading hence dense vegetation cover reduces soil moisture because of larger transpiration and less rainfall falling on the ground due to greater interception by leaves in contrast the soil is shaded more by the greater canopy vegetation thereby reducing direct radiation absorption and leading to lower soil temperature and soil evaporation rates and higher soil moisture chen et al 2009 therefore the relationship between soil water and vegetation is complex and the positive or negative impacts of vegetation cover on soil moisture likely depend on climate and the length of dry or wet periods chen et al 2009 typically when forest canopy cover exceeds a certain threshold level the forest would produce less runoff and soil water but more et than other land cover types li et al 2009 hydrological responses to land use change scenarios using a default original swat model were shown in table 5 figs 9 10 and supplementary materials s3 using calibrated parameters from swat t model swat t showed greater simulated actual evapotranspiration et and lower streamflow surq latq gwq and total runoff than the default swat table 5 at annual time scale at monthly time scale seasonal dynamics of et and sw simulated by default swat supplementary materials s3 were slightly different from those simulated by swat t fig 8 while seasonal variability of other hydrological factors were similar in addition monthly changes of hydrological factors under different land use change scenarios simulated by default swat supplementary materials s3 were similar to that simulated by swat t fig 8 except for et and sw furthermore fig 9 showed that absolute total runoff changes simulated by default swat were much smaller than those from swat t in 33 different sub basins and may be explained by the smaller difference between annual rainfall and total runoff relationship for default swat model fig 10 b compared to swat t fig 10 a in general these differences were probably caused by the difference of seasonal lai simulated by swat t and default swat fig 5 4 3 limitations and uncertainties even though it met the criteria for satisfactory model performance similar to other swat model applications calibration and validation hydrograph fig 6 showed that most of the peak flows shrestha et al 2016 and low flows wu and johnston 2008 were underestimated in addition the model overestimated a few peaks during the dry period and underestimated it during the high flow period which also was the case for other australian catchments studied by saha et al 2014 this was an acceptable result considering the fact that the swat model was not calibrated for single event high streamflow condition saha et al 2014 furthermore low capacity to simulate both low flows and peak flows also occur in other hydrological models eum et al 2017 thus difficulties in reproducing peak flows and low flows are common due to the theories of hydrological models and standards of model calibration zhang et al 2019 however if the model has limited capacity to capture peak and low flows it does affect the extreme value of the surface runoff tessema et al 2014 if we quantify the impacts of different lucc scenarios on surface runoff with this kind of hydrological model it may underestimate or overestimate the magnitude of lucc effect however investigating the implications of peak flows and low flows underestimation or overestimation on the lucc effect analysis on the surface runoff are beyond the scope of our present study and needs to be explored in future studies the study also found that land use change had only a small effect on water balance components except surface runoff this is in line with findings reported in other studies shrestha et al 2017 for instance brown et al 2015 assessed the impact of forestry on streamflow in southeastern australia using swat and found that the modelled introduction of plantation forestry did not significantly change streamflow karlsson et al 2016 also pointed out that land use changes only affected the mean flow by a few percentage points this result may also be caused by our hypothetical land use scenarios where land use change area in each scenario accounted for 15 of the total catchment area in fact previous studies bosch and hewlett 1982 stednick 1996 stated that forest land changes of 15 20 do not influence the annual water yield besides the small effect found in this study may also be due to the partial conversion scenarios occurring mainly in the northwestern part of the catchment where there is less rainfall distribution compared to the downstream part the forest part of the catchment hence the implemented scenarios might not cause remarkable changes in the hydrological processes particularly at the annual scale in addition to land use scenarios a large number of uncertainty sources hydrological models calibration periods objective function etc may influence the impact analysis sources of uncertainty for the hydrological model can be present because of the model structure e g model assumptions and functions as well as input data e g lack of relevant temporal and spatial variability of data on rainfall land uses soils and topography marhaento et al 2018 another important issue is the calibration practices including calibration period and calibration approach van der spek and bakker 2017 wallach et al 2019 sorooshian et al 1983 claimed that it is not the length of data used but the information contained in it and the efficiency with which that information is extracted i e the choice of a stochastically appropriate objective function that are important parameterization of hydrological models is also a well known source of uncertainty and have been discussed previously a few times as related to impact studies karlsson et al 2016 however studying these additional sources of uncertainty is beyond the scope of this study and will be addressed in future research furthermore the current study was focused only on the north johnstone river catchment moreover even though this catchment was deemed to be representative of all such tropical catchments this study lacked replication at the catchment scale accordingly additional catchments will need to be chosen in future studies to stand for the large range of climate physical conditions and runoff characteristics throughout tropical australia and to afford insights for future water management 5 summary and conclusions the default original swat model has poor performance in estimating the lai of different vegetation types for tropical areas for the first time the swat t model strauch and volk 2013 with an improved vegetation growth module was used to analyze the hydrological sensitivity of a tropical catchment in australia under different land use change scenarios prior to the simulation of land use change scenarios the swat t model was parameterized calibrated and validated with nse 0 59 nse 0 for default swat r2 0 70 r2 0 66 for default swat and pbias 2 5 pbias 42 for default swat for lai and nse 0 92 nse 0 90 for default swat r2 0 94 r2 0 90 for default swat and pbias 10 pbias 5 for default swat for streamflow therefore the swat t model was judged to perform satisfactorily in this catchment according to general performance indices overall the swat t model performed better in predicting monthly streamflow than the default swat model based on our major statistical indicators in an australian tropical catchment for the first time we used both models swat t and default swat to quantify hydrological responses to land use change scenarios in the selected tropical catchment results showed that lucc affected all hydrological variables of which the impact on surface runoff was the most remarkable at both monthly and annual time scales moreover changes of surq under different land use scenarios differed across months using swat t with the most obvious changes occurring during the wet season from december to may and similar results can be found for default swat the simulations also indicated that urbanization converting frse or rnge to urbn resulted in increased surface flow and decreased lateral flow and groundwater with no notable change in total runoff et and sw using swat t for instance surface runoff increased 16 mm 5 7 with a 2 3 increase in urbn area and 44 mm 15 9 with an 8 4 increase in urbn area the decreases of latq and gwq under urbanization were 3 5 while the impact of urbanization on total runoff et and sw were 0 7 additionally afforestation scenario 3 14 1 increase in frse area decreased surq by 26 mm 9 5 and led to slight changes in other hydrological variables within 2 0 annual rainfall and total runoff were strongly positively correlated r 0 94 for frse rnge and urbn and frse generally produced less total runoff than rnge and urbn for the same rainfall amounts furthermore urbn generally produced more surq and less latq and gwq than frse and rnge for the same rainfall amounts as shown in the scatter diagrams of rainfall runoff relationships fig 10 furthermore we found that swat t showed greater simulated actual evapotranspiration et and lower streamflow surq latq gwq and total runoff than the default swat at annual time scale in contrast at a monthly scale seasonal dynamics of et and sw simulated by default swat were slightly different from those simulated by swat t while seasonal variability of other hydrological factors were similar these differences can be attributed to the diversity of seasonal lai simulated by swat t and default swat therefore we conclude that using swat t is more reasonable in tropical catchments as it captures seasonal vegetation dynamics the remarkable increase in surface runoff from deforestation and urbanization can threaten the health of both people and the biosphere for instance urbanization has enlarged impermeable surface area increased runoff coefficient reduced concentration time and increased peak flow and frequency of floods in city rivers yaa et al 2012 in addition increased surface runoff will carry a large amount of sediment and pollutants degrading river ecosystems and for this particular catchment thereby threatening the health of the great barrier reef as the north johnstone river is a key tributary that discharges into the great barrier reef lagoon strategies to ameliorate the effects of land use change include increasing green space in urban areas to reduce runoff foley et al 2005 reducing nutrient and sediment inputs improving the management of drainage systems and others the results of studies such as reported here will provide important information for developing sustainable management of water resources in tropical eastern australia the research methods described in this study can be further extended to other

5581,water resources are critical to the sustainability of life on earth with a growing population and climate change it is imperative to assess the security of these resources over the past five decades satellite remote sensing has become indispensable in understanding the earth and atmospheric processes satellite sensors have the capability of providing data at global scales which is economical compared to the ground or airborne sensor acquisitions the science community made significant advances over recent years with the help of satellite remote sensing in view of these efforts the current review aims to present a comprehensive review of the role of remote sensing in assessing water security this review highlights the role of remote sensing applications to assess water quality quantity and hydroclimatic extreme events that play an important role in improving water security four water quality parameters namely chlorophyll a turbidity and total suspended solids tss secchi disk depth sdd and colored dissolved organic matter cdom are considered under water quantity assessment we review three aspects streamflow estimation terrestrial water storage and reservoir operations remote sensing applications in quantifying floods and droughts extremes are reviewed in this work we present how satellite sensor information acquired from different spectral bands

models and data assimilation strategies among others in the above areas finally possible future research pathways needed to address the issues faced by the science community are discussed this work is the second of the two part review series wherein the first part deals with the applications of satellite remote sensing for agriculture management keywords water security remote sensing water quality streamflow terrestrial water storage floods droughts reservoir monitoring 1 introduction from the available water resources only about 2 5 of the total amount of water on the earth constitutes the freshwater 1 5 of which can be accessed for various biophysical processes the sustainable management of water resources and ensuring water security is vitally important for creating responsible policies to maintain both ecological and economic health of a region mishra and singh 2010 according to the recent un report world population prospects 2019 the world population is projected to increase to 9 7 billion by 2050 and 11 billion by 2100 under a growing population and economy an increase in water demand and global water scarcity is inevitable ipcc 2019 the per capita consumption of water has increased substantially causing an increase in the extraction and use of freshwater resources from 500 km3 year to 3800 km3 year over the last 100 years oki and kanae 2006 further to attain food security there has been a rapid expansion in the crop land areas which is causing over exploitation of groundwater resources for irrigation the use of fertilizers to enhance crop productivity is affecting water quality harming marine and freshwater ecosystems vitousek et al 1997 the increase in industrial water use without proper policies for managing industrial effluents and water recycling especially in developing countries rajaram and das 2008 is raising concerns for maintaining water quality and minimizing water related health problems vörösmarty et al 2010 an imbalance between the development and utility of resources is posing a major challenge to manage water resources the extensive water use has negatively impacted the ecosystem by over exploiting the groundwater reserves and decreasing the drainage areas of lakes rivers and wetlands parry et al 2007 the situation is likely to get worse under the climate change scenario which is expected to influence the freshwater system through an increase in temperature sea level rise rainfall variability and an increase in extreme events parry et al 2007 according to the ipcc ipcc 2019 at 1 5 c rise in temperature 178 million people from the dryland population are vulnerable to water stress this number is estimated to increase to 220 and 270 million people with 2 c and 3 c rise in temperature respectively an increase in the global average surface air temperature during the 20th century houghton et al 2001 is likely to turn some part of snowfall into rainfall and snowmelt season is expected to commence earlier causing change in the timing and volume of snowmelt generated runoff huss and hock 2018 parry et al 2007 the temperature increase and the associated melting of polar ice are very likely to cause a rise in the sea levels resulting in the intrusion of saltwater into groundwater aquifers rendering the groundwater unusable and consequently decreasing the availability of groundwater resources oki and kanae 2006 although there is considerable uncertainty associated with the impact of climate change on the global water cycle chawla and mujumdar 2017 most of the studies indicate its intensification due to an increase in evaporation and consequently precipitation the intensified hydrologic cycle may result in frequent occurrences of extreme events such as drought floods and cyclones which are likely to cause catastrophic damage this may have greater detrimental effects in developing countries due to limited resources for mitigation and adaptation strategies huntington 2006 in addition to the anticipated effects of climate change on the water sector chawla and mujumdar 2015 the increase in water demand along with lack of effective governance is adding to the challenge of maintaining water quality and efficient use of water resources o connell 2017 sheffield et al 2018 1 1 role of remote sensing in water security considering the role of water security in global development the united nations has recognized the provision of clean water and sanitation as one of the sustainable development goals sdgs sdg 6 in particular to achieve the sdgs integrated management of water resources has become the scientific paradigm the management of the availability of water resources under ongoing global scale changes requires continuous monitoring of water availability and its vulnerabilities with space and time mishra and coulibaly 2009 hydro meteorological information e g precipitation streamflow and soil moisture plays a vital role to improve water resource management and to quantify the extreme events however accurate measurement and monitoring of hydro meteorologic variables through in situ observations is challenging because of outdated or non existing socioeconomic data and deteriorating observation network mishra and coulibaly 2009 several studies report a global decline in hydrometric stations rodda et al 1993 shiklomanov et al 2002 mishra and coulibaly 2009 impeding the ability to monitor the availability of resources predict droughts and forecast floods the in situ observation stations are non uniformly distributed and also operate intermittently due to insufficient investment in infrastructure inadequate institutional framework lack of government interest and inability to comprehend the need of long term records leading to a lack of continuous time series of different hydro meteorologic variables pearson 1998 mishra and coulibaly 2009 sheffield et al 2018 in situ hydro climate data observed by gauges provides valuable information for water resources management however these data have key limitations for example lack of spatial coverage and missing data sets in most parts of the globe except in a few developed countries also the existence of a political situation or transboundary water sharing condition may hinder the procurement of data for several important rivers kim et al 2019 due to limitations in ground based observations the availability of remote sensing products has served as an important source for researchers water resources managers and related stakeholders in their endeavors remote sensing is a cost effective method for viewing large water bodies with high temporal coverage and reasonable accuracy which is physically not possible through in situ measurements the large scale coverage of areas by the satellite data helps in understanding the evolution of hazards which is critical for managing resources van dijk and renzullo 2011 this paper part 2 of the two paper series provides a review on the applications of remote sensing data for water security in this regard three important areas are considered in this review 1 water quality assessment 2 water quantity which includes streamflows terrestrial water storage and reservoir monitoring and 3 extreme events which include floods and droughts fig 1 presents a detailed schematic diagram of various areas and sub topics selected for review in this paper 2 overview of remote sensing satellites an overview of satellite sensors mentioned in this review is highlighted in this section table 1 presents a list of optical thermal sensors and tables 2 and 3 present the list of active and passive microwave sensors in addition to sensors that measure signals in the electromagnetic spectrum missions such as gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and its follow on grace follow on measure the gravity field through a pair of satellites which essentially look at each other instead of the earth surface table 4 we also provide the information of operation duration spatial and temporal resolution of each of the sensors 3 remote sensing for assessing water security 3 1 water quality the rapid and continuous growth in the population and industries has led to an increase in the point and non point sources of pollution to water bodies while point sources can be traced to a single source non point sources are diffused in nature and are difficult to track these polluting sources deteriorate the quality of water and affect unique ecosystems of both inland waters such as rivers lakes and reservoirs as well as coastal waters which supports a wide variety of aquatic flora and fauna dekker et al 1995 therefore monitoring water quality is crucial to ascertain the sustainability and usability of water resources the physical chemical and biological properties of water determine the quality of water traditionally these properties were quantified through field and laboratory analysis which can be time consuming and labor intensive bierman et al 2011 glasgow et al 2004 also spatio temporal characteristics of water properties are influenced by several factors such as the location of sampling urbanization land use transitions deforestation and climate change temperature change in particular delpla et al 2009 so in situ surveys over large demographic areas spanning long durations may turn out to be infeasible in this context satellite and airborne sensors can provide information which can be used to efficiently monitor certain water quality parameters such as chlorophyll a suspended sediments turbidity total phosphorus dissolved organic content temperature secchi disk depth heavy metal pollution among others over a large scale since the advent of landsat missions in the 1970s satellite remote sensing information is being increasingly used to assess water quality parameters alparslan et al 2007 bhavsar 1984 dekker and peters 1993 the spectral characteristics of a clear water surface are significantly different from water mixed with impurities or pollutants a clear water body absorbs around 97 99 of the incident energy and reflects only 1 3 of incident radiations büttner et al 1987 this proportion alters with the change in the quality of water with polluted water having higher reflectance further the dominant reflected wavelength changes with change in the constituents of water therefore the presence of different substances in the water body results in unique spectral signatures which are measured by various optical and thermal sensors mounted on different satellites and airborne platforms to monitor water quality a relationship between spectral reflectance and water quality parameters needs to be established büttner et al 1987 ritchie et al 2003 wherein the general form of the relationship is given by eq 1 1 y a b x or y a b x where y is the spectral reflectance measured by the remote sensors x is the water quality parameter of interest and a and b are the empirical factors ritchie et al 1976 showed that water with low sediment concentration has a maximum reflection at 0 55 μm compared to 0 6 μm by water with high sediment concentration the ultraviolet radiations 0 25 0 39 µm get reflected from the water surface and usually contain the information on the presence of oil slicks on water bodies seyhan and dekker 1986 within the visible region due to differences in the absorption and reflection patterns various water quality parameters such as chlorophyll a suspended sediments dissolved organic content among others can be identified büttner et al 1987 beyond the visible range most of the energy is absorbed by the water body this indicates that sensor selection is critical for monitoring water quality as reflected irradiance depends on the parameter to be examined and its concentration ritchie et al 2003 information from landsat alparslan et al 2007 brezonik et al 2005 brivio et al 2001 büttner et al 1987 ritchie et al 1990 modis binding et al 2012 härmä et al 2001 lesht et al 2013 swain and sahoo 2017 orbview 2 seawifs gohin et al 2019 vos et al 2003 satellites have often been used to detect quality of water bodies recently sentinel 2 datasets are also being employed for the study of water quality bonansea et al 2019 sòria perpinyà et al 2020 besides hyperspectral images from sensors such as hyperion are also increasingly used due to their better ability to detect suspended sediments dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll content in water bodies hakvoort et al 2002 thiemann and kaufmann 2002 during recent years attempts are being made to merge hyperspectral sensor data with multispectral sensor data to map water quality gohin et al 2019 östlund et al 2001 the merging of datasets helps in attaining good spectral as well as spatial resolutions which is necessary to determine the quality of water accurately for further details regarding different satellite sensors used for obtaining water quality parameters readers are encouraged to refer to gholizadeh et al 2016 literature suggests that optical remote sensing is widely used to monitor water quality parameters to the best of our knowledge there are limited studies that incorporate other bands of the spectrum such as microwave frequencies for this purpose zhang et al 2002 2003a zhang et al 2003b hence we limit this review to satellite optical sensors in this section we review the role of satellite remote sensing towards estimating four important water quality parameters a chlorophyll a b turbidity and total suspended sediments tss c secchi disk depth sdd and d colored dissolved organic matter cdom 3 1 1 chlorophyll a among different water quality parameters chlorophyll a chl a is one of the most widely examined parameters using remote sensing information it is a photosynthesis pigment that is responsible for causing green color reflect green wavelength while absorbing energy from other wavelengths in plants algae and cyanobacteria its occurrence in water bodies is linked directly to the presence of algal bloom and therefore indicates the extent of eutrophication in water bodies nitrogen and phosphorous are the two compounds sourced from fertilizer runoff and burning fossil fuels that act as catalysts for the growth of algae and causing eutrophication of water bodies although eutrophication is a natural process nutrient loading increases its rate and accelerate the degradation of water bodies li and li 2004 the presence of different chl a concentration in water results in spectral reflectance curve with absorption in the blue 0 4 µm and red 0 7 µm bands and reflectance in green 0 5 µm and near infrared 0 8 µm bands this property is used by various sensors to retrieve the chl a information from water although in most of the studies visible range bands from multispectral sensors are used to estimate chl a brivio et al 2001 dekker and peters 1993 ritchie et al 1990 dekker and peters 1993 and härmä et al 2001 found that it is challenging to determine chl a concentration using multispectral data in water bodies with high suspended sediments therefore narrow bandwidth imageries are necessary to measure chl a concentrations most of the literature suggests that optimum bandwidth to quantify chl a levels is around 675 nm and 700 nm gholizadeh et al 2016 during recent years merged satellite datasets are also being used to monitor chl a gohin et al 2019 other relevant literature wherein different sensors are used to determine the chl a parameter is summarized in table 5 among various satellite sensors landsat tm and etm are found to be most widely used to assess chl a due to high spatio temporal coverage and free availability eq 1 presents a general empirical model that relates water quality parameter with spectral bands dekker and peters 1993 noted that chl a concentrations could be well monitored if more than one spectral band is used subsequently several studies used band ratios which can substantially reduce the effect of atmosphere and increase the signal to noise ratio bhattf et al 2010 dekker and peters 1993 hoogenboom et al 1998 kim et al 2014 lim and choi 2015 thiemann and kaufmann 2002 harding et al 1995 developed the following equation eq 2 to determine chl a content empirically using band ratio 2 lo g 10 chl a a b l o g 10 g with g r 2 2 r 1 r 3 where a and b are constants derived from in situ measurements r 1 r 2 and r 3 are the spectral reflectance at 460 nm 490 nm and 520 nm respectively in addition several other empirical algorithms that employ multiple spectral bands have been developed which include two band algorithm 2bda dall olmo and gitelson 2005 three band algorithm 3bda gitelson et al 2003 dall olmo and gitelson 2005 normalized difference chlorophyll index algorithm ndci mishra and mishra 2012 maximum chlorophyll index mci algorithm binding et al 2013 surface algal bloom index algorithm sabi alawadi 2010 fluorescence line height flh algorithm zhao et al 2010 and normalized green red difference index ngrdi feng et al 2015 the 3bda is found to be useful in quantifying chl a in turbid waters with a wide range of optical complexity moses et al 2009 however it is based on several assumptions such as i absorption by suspended solids beyond 700 nm is same as that of 665 675 nm and can be ignored ii absorption beyond 730 nm is nearly zero and iii back scattering coefficient of chl a is spectrally invariant mishra and mishra 2012 the mci algorithm was found to work well when chl a concentrations range from 10 to 300 mg m 3 it failed in high biomass conditions and with variations in optical properties of water the ndci could work well in turbid productive waters and could also be transferred to other geographical locations without adding any significant uncertainties making it superior to the 2bda 3bda and mci the sabi was found to accurately delineate spatial distributions of algal bloom without getting affected by environmental conditions like aerosol and sun glaze the ngrdi is noticed to perform reasonable in water bodies with extreme turbidity and can also help in delineating potential eutrophication areas furthermore attempts are being made to incorporate empirical orthogonal function eof to measure chl a levels in surface water qi et al 2014 the eof approach considers spectral variance of normalized rayleigh corrected reflectance data at 469 555 645 and 859 nm and relates the observed variance with chl a levels the authors found this method to be useful for chl a concentrations ranging from 3 to 100 μg l however the empirical nature of the algorithm along with limited spectral bands for the aforementioned wavelengths led to significant uncertainties in the results it highlights the need for further improvement in the remotely sensed data besides one of the prime concerns with all the empirical models is that they require accurate parameterization which may vary with the optical properties of the water body mishra and mishra 2012 3 1 2 turbidity and total suspended sediments tss the monitoring of total suspended sediments tss is critical for analyzing river dynamics as it serves as an indicator for water quality and also used in sediment discharge and transport applications peterson et al 2018 the suspended sediments affect water quality by blocking the transmission of light altering the nutrient concentration obstructing channels and reducing dissolved oxygen he et al 2017 the presence of suspended particles causes turbidity in the water body the turbidity of water is directly linked to suspended particles higher the turbidity more the concentration of suspended particles therefore the measurement of turbidity is often considered as a proxy for sediment concentration in the water body rügner et al 2013 wass et al 1997 further tss and turbidity can also be used to indirectly monitor heavy metal concentration in water bodies nasrabadi et al 2016 the presence of tss and consequently turbidity in water bodies increases reflectance from red and nir regions of the electromagnetic spectrum dogliotti et al 2015 feng et al 2012 ritchie et al 1976 ritchie and cooper 1988 this property is used to monitor turbidity and tss parameters different sensors are used to measure different levels of turbidity in the water body the red bands of landsat tm 630 690 nm and spot 610 680 nm sensors and modis 645 nm band are found to be useful in monitoring low turbidity levels ranging from 0 9 to 15 ntu nephelometric turbidity unit bustamante et al 2009 chen et al 2007 goodin et al 1996 meris dataset at 681 nm can measure turbidity in the range 1 25 ntu ouillon et al 2008 apart from single bands different band ratios are also used to quantify tss and turbidity the ratio of green 560 nm and blue 413 nm bands from the meris dataset is used to map turbidity in the range of 1 60 ntu potes et al 2012 the ratio of red 630 690 nm and blue 400 500 nm bands from the landsat dataset is used to monitor high turbidity concentrations ranging from 2 to 997 ntu liversedge 2007 ritchie et al 1976 found out that in general the optimum wavelength to quantify suspended material in water bodies is 700 800 nm several empirical models have been developed to relate spectral reflectance with the concentration of suspended material in water bodies schiebe et al 1992 and harrington et al 1992 developed an empirical model given by eq 3 3 r i b i 1 e c s i where r i is the reflectance corresponding to band i c is the concentration of tss b i represents the reflectance saturation of band i at high tss level and s i gives the tss concentration at 63 saturation reflectance of band i b i and s i are coefficients that are statistically determined due to a lack of generality in empirical models analytical models based on radiation transfer equations rtes are developed for instance volpe et al 2011 developed eqs 4 and 5 using rte to retrieve tss concentration from the reflectance measured by the sensors 4 r 0 5 r 1 1 5 r 5 r r dp 1 e k d k u c h ρ b π e k d k u b h where r is water surface reflectance and is related to other controlling factors such as r which is subsurface reflectance r dp is reflectance for optically deep water k d is vertically averaged diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance k u c is vertically averaged diffuse attenuation coefficient for upwelling radiance from water column scattering k u b is vertically averaged diffuse attenuation coefficient for upwelling radiance from water column scattering ρ b represent the bottom albedo h is the water depth and u b a b where b is backscattering coefficient and a represents the absorption coefficient the rte based model helps in addressing the issues commonly faced in the empirical model such as i interference from the reflection from the bottom of the water body ii accurately knowing the optical properties of water bodies and iii uncertainties in retrieved estimates volpe et al 2011 table 5 summarizes the widely used satellite sensors for quantifying turbidity and tss levels in water bodies from the literature survey it is noticed that landsat tm is the most commonly used dataset for estimating turbidity and tss 3 1 3 secchi disk depth sdd clarity of water body is considered generally as a visual measure for water quality li and li 2004 secchi disk depth sdd is a measure for the water clarity index davies colley and smith 2001 in this method a black and white disk called secchi disk invented by an italian astronomer pietro angelo secchi in 1865 having a diameter ranging from 30 to 100 cm marked with graduated lines is inserted into the water body and noted to the point of disappearance davies colley and smith 2001 the depth of disappearance is known as sdd and is inversely related to turbidity and tss concentration in water bodies the sdd measurement is based on light attenuation principle wherein tyler 1968 and preisendorfer 1986 found that sdd is inversely related to the sum of two light attenuation coefficients c and k as indicated in eq 6 6 sdd g c k where g depends on visible reflectance from the secchi disk and it varies within the range of 6 9 tyler 1968 although sdd is an inexpensive way of monitoring water clarity it is highly subjective and depends on the visual accuracy of the observer sdd is also affected by tides on the water surface heddam 2016 since sdd is related to turbidity and tss concentration in the water body several empirical models have been developed to associate these two parameters some of the relationships are listed in eq 7 9 brezonik 1978 gikas et al 2009 usgs 2014 7 l o g sdd 0 48 0 72 l o g tur 8 l o g sdd 2 11 l o g tss 0 16 9 sdd 11 123 t u r 0 637 where tur indicates turbidity in formazin nephelometric unit fnu and tss represents total suspended sediments in the water body apart from empirical relationships spectral bands from different satellite data are also used directly to measure sdd due to easy monitoring of turbidity and tss levels in the visible range red and blue bands are found to be useful in mapping sdd hellweger et al 2004 used the red band whereas lathrop and lillesand 1986 used the green band from the landsat tm to determine sdd ekercin 2007 found blue green and red bands of the ikonos to explain 98 93 of the variance in sdd according to allee and johnson 1999 the landsat tm red band is most useful in determining the sdd choubey 1998 demonstrated the use of spectral bands of irs 1a liss i satellite data in determining sdd in the tawa reservoir narmada basin india they inferred that concentration and grain size of suspended solids are the main factors that influence sdd wu et al 2008 developed a relationship between sdd and spectral reflectance from landsat tm and modis datasets as indicated in eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 ln s d d 1 133 10 533 l a n d s a t t m blue 13 805 l a n d s a t t m red 11 ln s d d 0 474 15 24 m o d i s blue 21 130 m o d i s red in addition to single bands the ratio between different spectral bands is found to be useful in computing sdd in highly turbid water bodies with low sdd lathrop 1992 giardino et al 2001 found the ratio between blue and green landsat tm bands to be suitable in estimating sdd studies found the ratio of blue and red landsat tm bands as indicated in the general form in eq 12 to be efficient in mapping water clarity in a lake kloiber et al 2002b sawaya et al 2003 chipman et al 2004 similarly nelson et al 2003 found blue to red band ratio from landsat tm to be useful in estimating sdd across 93 lakes in michigan usa while the above works used landsat data sawaya et al 2003 noticed the ratio of ikonos blue and red bands to be better than landsat data for mapping sdd eq 12 12 ln s d d a landsa t blue landsa t red b landsa t blue c furthermore several works found strong correlation between chl a and sdd al shehhi et al 2019 allee and johnson 1999 brezonik 1978 carlson 1977 dekker and peters 1993 doña et al 2015 doña et al 2014 gikas et al 2009 gikas et al 2006 stadelmann et al 2001 different satellite datasets used to measure sdd are enlisted in table 5 among all the datasets landsat tm due to its low cost and high spatial and temporal coverage is most frequently used in estimating sdd 3 1 4 colored dissolved organic matter cdom colored dissolved organic matter cdom also referred to as aquatic humus limnohumic acid gelbstoff or gilvin is composed of macromolecules with aromatic carboxylic fulvic and humic acids derived from decomposition of plant material in soils and wetlands bacterial activity algal growth and sediment loading brezonik et al 2005 carder et al 1989 twardowski and donaghay 2001 these compounds impart yellow brown color to the water body when present in high concentrations branco and kremer 2005 gholizadeh et al 2016 an increase in cdom loading affects the physical chemical and biological properties of water bodies higher cdom levels cause attenuation to the penetration of light into water bodies and also support the growth of phytoplankton making water bodies more eutrophic stedmon et al 2011 therefore the presence of cdom influences the structure and functioning of the riverine ecosystem kutser et al 2005 cdom is found to be strongly correlated to other water quality parameters such as chl a tss and turbidity levels brezonik et al 2005 therefore visible spectral bands are found to be relevant in monitoring cdom concentration in water bodies further the presence of cdom is noticed to cause absorption in the ultraviolet range and blue green bands chen et al 2004 green and blough 1994 brezonik et al 2005 found that maximum energy absorbance occurs in 440 nm band due to the presence of cdom which coincides with the chl a absorption band carder et al 1989 therefore it becomes extremely difficult to segregate cdom levels from chl a concentration cdom level is usually obtained by determining the wavelength absorption coefficient using different datasets in this regard several analytical models have been developed hoge et al 1995 developed a two band radiance model inversion technique to demonstrate the cdom absorption coefficient using the coastal zone color scanner czcs spectral bands however the accuracy of the method depends on the presence of chlorophyll in the water body hirtle and rencz 2003 found a strong correlation between dissolved organic matter and landsat tm blue and green bands for the kejimkujik national park lake brezonik et al 2005 used the landsat tm data and identified that the presence of cdom decreases brightness in blue and green bands kutser et al 2005 used both landsat and ikonos datasets to determine the absorption coefficient in boreal lakes to monitor cdom levels the authors found that in comparison to 8 bit landsat data 11 bit ikonos data is more suitable for estimating the amount of cdom in boreal lakes due to higher digital resolution they further noticed that the ratio of 565 nm and 660 nm bands from the16 bit advanced land imager ali data is best in estimating cdom due to difficulty in retrieving cdom concentrations in the presence of suspended solids and chlorophyll content the use of hyperspectral remote sensing datasets is gaining importance in determining cdom levels menken et al 2006 identified that the ratio of 670 nm to 571 nm modis bands could best estimate cdom levels brando and dekker 2003 developed a matrix inversion technique to retrieve cdom concentrations using the eo 1 hyperion hyperspectral dataset which was noted to show sufficient sensitivity to detect concentrations of cdom chl a and tss in complex waters zhu et al 2011 proposed a method for inversion of hyperspectral remote sensing to determine the absorption coefficient for cdom inversion algorithms in general are found to be efficient in estimating cdom over a large spatio temporal scale karaska et al 2004 used the aviris dataset to monitor dissolved organic content along with other water quality parameters in the neuse river north carolina tehrani et al 2013 used three datasets seawifs modis and meris to estimate cdom concentrations and found that the ratio of 510 nm and 560 nm bands from meris dataset gives the most accurate results recently juhls et al 2019 used the meris dataset to determine the absorption coefficient of cdom in the arctic shelf region the proposed retrieval algorithm was found to perform well in extreme absorbing and high scattering waters with high optical complexity that cover the fluvial marine transition the other datasets that are used in cdom measurements are summarized in table 5 3 2 surface and sub surface water resources 3 2 1 streamflow estimation streamflow or discharge in the river is a dominant process of the hydrologic cycle by which water from the land surface is transported to the oceans river discharge is the volume of water flowing through the river cross section per unit of time and is expressed generally as cubic meter per second or cubic feet per second the measurement of river discharge provides information on water availability and is therefore necessary for water resource management and managing flood hazards mishra and coulibaly 2009 vörösmarty et al 2010 despite being a critical component for understanding surface water balance river discharges are understood poorly due to limited in situ networks shiklomanov et al 2002 mishra and coulibaly 2009 traditionally the in situ measurement of discharge involves the use of an already established stage discharge relationship or rating curve to estimate discharge corresponding to the stream stage or water level height recorded by stream gauges the in situ discharge measurement has several limitations such as stream gauges are located on a few large sized rivers and are not spatially distributed tang et al 2009 most of the globally significant rivers are sparsely gauged alsdorf et al 2003 further stream gauges are difficult to install in complex topography regions also there is a global decrease in the number of stream gauges due to a reduction in government funds for monitoring of stream gauges shiklomanov et al 2002 mishra and coulibaly 2009 the existence of a political situation or transboundary water sharing condition may further hinder the procurement of discharge data for several important rivers kim et al 2019 the measurement of water level by stream gauge is based on the assumption that runoff generated upstream of the catchment flows to a single downstream outlet this assumption might not hold in basins which are dominated by wetlands and floodplains where water from upstream reaches is diffused and then reach the channel alsdorf and lettenmaier 2003 also braided rivers characterized by several intertwined channels which keeps on changing the shapes pose an additional challenge for discharge measurement alsdorf and lettenmaier 2003 satellite remote sensing can circumvent these issues while estimating discharge and water storage alsdorf et al 2003 alsdorf and lettenmaier 2003 remote sensing datasets have the potential of providing frequent global coverage of discharge estimates which may offer an opportunity to improve the global streamflow network however streamflow discharge cannot be measured directly by satellite sensors therefore other hydraulic variables such as water level height velocity river cross section area river width and surface water slope among others are also measured by sensors the accuracy of discharge measurement depends on the efficiency with which the aforementioned hydraulic variables are estimated by remotely sensed data kim et al 2019 we find from the literature that a substantial amount of work is carried out using the altimeter datasets further there is a progression in the way altimeter datasets are used to estimate discharge therefore to keep the review concise we focus on scientific developments in streamflow estimation using the altimetric data radar altimeters are demonstrated to be useful in estimating water level variations in inaccessible areas leon et al 2006 the use of altimetry came into limelight with 1969 nasa s skylab s 193 radar altimeter experiment brown 1977 altimeters measure the time taken by the nadir directed radar pulse to cover a round trip from satellite to water surface and use it to determine the distance from satellite to water surface the water level is determined by computing differences in the satellite s position with respect to the reference ellipsoid and distance from the satellite to the water surface tang et al 2009 the general equation to measure the height of the water surface from the satellite is given by eq 13 13 h h r c o r r where h is the water surface height h is the height of satellite orbit r is the altimeter range measurement and corr represents the various corrections pertaining to tropospheric correction tc both dry and wet ionospheric correction ic and tidal correction t that need to be applied eq 14 14 corr t c i c t radar altimetry was initially intended to monitor sea surface height variations due to its large footprint with the launch of geosat 1985 1990 topex poseidon 1992 2005 ers 1 1991 2000 ers 2 1995 2011 geosat follow on gfo 1998 2008 jason 1 2001 2013 jason 2 2008 2016 environmental satellite envisat 2002 2012 jason 3 2016 present sentinel 3 2016 present and saral altika 2013 present satellites usage of altimeter was extended to inland waters berry et al 2005 birkett 1995a together available global altimetry datasets provide approximately three decade long information on water levels of large lakes and global rivers this information finds applications in the areas of predictions in ungauged basins climate change detection monitoring river water availability and executing hydrologic models 3 2 1 1 using altimeters some of the pioneering works by birkett 1994 and mason et al 1994 involve the use of radar altimetry for mapping changes in lake levels mason et al 1994 used esa s ers 1 radar altimeter along with an infra red radiometer atsr to monitor volumes of lakes morris and gill 1994 successfully demonstrated the use of geosat altimetry data to monitor variations in the water level of five great lakes of the united states and lake st clair birkett 1995a assessed the potential of topex poseidon t p to map global lake levels apart from great lakes altimeter data is often used to measure water levels in large global rivers in one of the initial works koblinsky et al 1993 demonstrated the ability of geosat altimeter data to estimate the amazon river level or stage at four locations they concluded that the geosat altimeter based water level estimates are prone to errors which may be overcome by other missions such as ers 1 and t p birkett 1995b monitored the caspian sea the sudd wetlands and the amazon river using the t p dataset and noticed that seasonal and annual trends could be observed however the accuracy of the estimates was unknown which make the results unreliable from geosat to ers 1 and t p there is a reduction in the satellite orbital errors making radar altimetry a routine method to monitor inland water surfaces smith 1997 birkett 1998 identified that the t p data could successfully monitor rivers with a width greater than 1 km birkett 2000 used the t p data in conjugation with near infrared imagery from the avhrr dataset to obtain levels of rivers merging with lake chad and also determine permanent and seasonal lake levels coe and birkett 2004 extended this work to obtain mean monthly discharge estimates downstream of lake chad leon et al 2006 used t p and envisat datasets to determine stage discharge relationships between satellite derived water level and river discharge at 21 virtual stations in the upper negro basin a sub basin of amazon river basin from its source at columbia and venezuela borders to manaus in brazil birkett et al 2002 evaluated the t p data for all the major rivers and tributaries in the amazon river basin they successfully demonstrated that the altimeter data could be used to obtain water level information at 10 days interval for rivers with a width of 1 km the authors further suggested that the inclusion of grace and jers 1 datasets to the existing t p dataset may provide more accurate variability in water levels da silva et al 2010 compared the performance of ers 2 and envisat for estimating water levels in the amazon basin and found the latter to perform better sulistioadi et al 2015 demonstrated the use of envisat for small 4 200 m width and medium 200 800 m width rivers tarpanelli et al 2014 combined velocity information from the modis dataset with water level data obtained from the envisat altimeter to estimate discharge for the po river italy they found that the coupled dataset compares reasonably well with the in situ data cryosat 2 satellite was launched with the prime objective of monitoring the cryosphere however it has been used to map inland waters and is shown to have the potential to supplement the observations from envisat and jason 1 dibarboure et al 2012 villadsen et al 2015 evaluated the performance of cryosat 2 to monitor river levels in ganges and brahmaputra river basins the authors found that despite a large revisit time of 369 days the dataset could represent peak flows during summer due to monsoon and melting of snow in the himalayas schneider et al 2018 found accurate estimates with an average error of 0 38 m for water level observations from the cryosat 2 data for the po river italy against the in situ data jason 2 mission also known as the ocean surface topography mission ostm was launched as a continuation to the t p mission to measure the surface topography of oceans and continental surface waters lambin et al 2010 jason 2 was found to perform better than jason 1 and t p missions while monitoring lakes and reservoir systems birkett and beckley 2010 kuo and kao 2011 processed the jason 2 altimeter data using waveform retracking and water detection algorithms to estimate the surface height of the bajhang river in taiwan having seasonal width ranging from 100 m to 1 km through this work the use of altimeter data for monitoring small rivers with varying widths was successfully demonstrated jason 2 data was used successfully to estimate instantaneous discharge papa et al 2012 simulate flood events jarihani et al 2013 and also for flood forecasting chang et al 2019 hossain et al 2014 purposes further the use of jason 2 and jason 3 altimeter datasets along with ancillary data of river width and the course are reported to improve river water level estimates biswas et al 2019 combined the landsat and sar information with jason 3 altimeter and applied an extent based approach in two methods i river mask based k means clustering and ii k means clustering embedded with river mask to improve the satellite altimeter derived river heights saral altika mission is the only altimeter that works with a high frequency microwave band of ka 36 5 ghz which results in an effective footprint of 1 3 km saral is designated to fill the gap between the envisat and sentinel 3 missions kumar et al 2017 since it operates on a high frequency the signal was initially expected to suffer from higher attenuation however this shortcoming was utilized to detect heavy rainfall and flood wave conditions roy et al 2015 further the potential of the saral altimeter to monitor inland waters kumar et al 2015 which include braided rivers was successfully demonstrated dubey et al 2015 furthermore gupta et al 2015 converted water levels retrieved from the saral altika into discharge for the tapi river in india and used it to set up the hec ras hydraulic model for flood inundation modeling for further applications related to the saral altika mission readers may refer to kumar et al 2017 the sentinel 3 is a recently launched satellite mission under the european commission s copernicus program the mission comprises of four satellites amongst which the two satellites satellites a and b were launched in 2016 and 2018 respectively the sentinel 3 satellites are equipped with dual frequency sar altimeter sral which is similar to the cryosat altimeter with advancements although the primary purpose of the sentinel 3 mission is to measure sea surface topography and thickness of sea ice data can also be used to measure the height of rivers and lakes further details on the sentinel 3 mission can be obtained from donlon et al 2012 the initial observations from the sentinel 3 mission are found to be encouraging for water level and discharge monitoring bogning et al 2018 tarpanelli et al 2019 demonstrated the potential of sentinel 3 satellite with three on board sensors to estimate river discharge the direct use of altimeter data for water level and consequently river discharge is affected by low temporal resolution varying from 10 to 35 days and a large footprint of the data therefore several works in recent years have combined the radar altimeter data with in situ measurements in a data assimilation framework through data assimilation different satellite products can be merged with the hydrologic hydraulic model to estimate river discharge while taking into account both data and model errors mclaughlin 1995 neal et al 2009 showed that discharge estimates in ungauged basins could be improved by assimilating combined envisat sar and lidar derived dtm datasets into a coupled hydrologic and hydrodynamic model michailovsky et al 2013 assimilated the envisat data into a river routing model to obtain discharge along the main channel of the brahmaputra river similar assimilation studies were carried out by emery et al 2017 and paiva et al 2013 3 2 1 2 using empirical equations and rating curve apart from water levels heights discharge can also be estimated using other hydraulic variables such as water surface area channel slope average channel width and velocity of rivers this information can be obtained from existing remote sensing datasets and used as an input in general hydraulic equations bjerklie et al 2003 for further details readers may refer to bjerklie et al 2003 there have been several works wherein the river stage and consequently discharge is indirectly estimated by correlating inundated area with ground measurements of stage or discharge smith et al 1995 used the ers 1 dataset to develop an area discharge rating curve for a braided glacial river in british columbia canada smith et al 1996 further extended this work to estimate discharge in ungauged braided rivers although individual remote sensing datasets have been used to obtain information of flood inundation and discharge frappart et al 2005 used the combined information from sar jers 1 and t p datasets to estimate both flood extent and water levels in the negro river of the amazon basin to determine the water volume stored in the floodplains however they observed that depending on the way floods inundate the area geographically there can be very low to no difference in the flood plain and river level making the measurements erroneous therefore to overcome this problem a combination of several radar altimeters may be useful frappart et al 2006 extended this work and used altimetry data from ers 2 envisat and t p satellites to develop water level time series for the lower mekong river basin and observed strong seasonality signals in various rivers in the catchment furthermore xu et al 2004 used the quickbird 2 satellite data at a high spatial resolution of 0 61 m to estimate water surface width and developed relationships between water surface width and river width stage and stage discharge rating curves the rating curves were used to estimate discharge in the yangtze river china similar work was carried out by zhang et al 2004 to determine river discharge in a non trapezoidal open channel smith and pavelsky 2008 used the modis data to determine channel geometry parameters to understand discharge and flow conveyance in inaccessible river systems birkinshaw et al 2014 used the altimeter data from ers 2 and envisat to estimate river stage information they combined the altimeter data with channel slope information and river channel width obtained from the landsat to estimate discharge in the ungauged locations of mekong and ob rivers sichangi et al 2016 combined altimetry data from several altimeter missions to improve the temporal resolution of the water level data they further used this combined data with the modis data and dem to obtain discharge estimates based on stage and both stage and width the authors found that using both stage and width can significantly improve river discharge estimates 3 2 1 3 surface water ocean topography swot mission the success of altimeter data in mapping discharge is noted to depend on first the accuracy of water level change estimates second frequency of obtaining water level estimates and third conversion of water level data to discharge estimates koblinsky et al 1993 besides most of the studies reported earlier are for individual river reaches and also depend on in situ data based on which relationship between different variables is developed therefore there is still a need for global monitoring of rivers several of the limitations associated with the existing radar altimetry are expected to be resolved by the planned surface water ocean topography swot mission alsdorf and lettenmaier 2003 the swot mission is designed to provide consistent and coherent information about river discharge and storage which will improve the understanding of inaccessible and ungauged rivers biancamaria et al 2016 the mission aims at measuring water surface elevation top width and free surface slope enabling discharge estimation for rivers with a width greater than 50 m durand et al 2016 assimilating this information into the hydrodynamic models will allow extraction of information such as bathymetry which is not directly observable and may further assist in the estimation of river discharge andreadis et al 2007 pavelsky et al 2014 explored the potential of swot mission to monitor global rivers and noted that the mission would significantly improve our hydrological database by updating the global runoff data centre grdc observation network several initial exploratory studies based on synthetic data have been conducted which suggest that the swot measurements could allow accurate estimates of river discharge for many rivers without in situ calibration andreadis et al 2007 assimilated water surface elevation information from the synthetic swot experiment to estimate river flow depth and discharge durand et al 2008 estimated bathymetric depth and slope from water surface elevation measurements obtained from the synthetic swot experiments and assimilated into the lisflood fp model to estimate discharge further uncertainty from river channel bathymetry which is the main source of error in discharge estimates is also quantified biancamaria et al 2011 assimilated the synthetic swot observations corresponding to the ob river to estimate changes in water depths assuming river bathymetry and quantified the errors due to uncertainties in atmospheric forcing fields and swot orbits they found that the assimilation scheme at a nominal orbit of the mission has the least error in estimating river water depth most of the studies above assumed river bathymetry and neglected the associated errors yoon et al 2012 assimilated water surface elevation information into the lisflood fp model to demonstrate river bathymetry estimation for obtaining river discharge from the swot mission for the ohio river basin through the assimilation process discharge and bathymetry errors were accurately modeled and it is noticed that errors in bathymetry measurement can have a significant influence on river discharge estimates similar attempts are made over the recent years that assimilate synthetic swot observation into hydrodynamic models to improve discharge estimates andreadis and schumann 2014 pedinotti et al 2014 munier et al 2015 domeneghetti et al 2018 apart from data assimilation techniques there are significant works that focused on the development of algorithms to estimate discharge using various hydraulic variables from the swot mission bjerklie 2007 developed an algorithm based on manning s equation that uses variables such as channel width channel slope and meander length to estimate velocity and discharge of rivers gleason and smith 2014 developed at many stations hydraulic geometry amhg algorithm to reduce the number of parameters required to estimate river discharge using multiple satellite images durand et al 2014 developed an algorithm based on the diffusive approximation of shallow water equations to estimate river bathymetry roughness coefficient and discharge using surface elevation and slope information garambois and monnier 2015 proposed inverse models based on the saint venant equations to invert effective low flow bathymetry and roughness coefficient to estimate discharge durand et al 2016 presented an intercomparison of five discharge algorithms for 19 rivers with varying hydraulic and geomorphological conditions and suggested that incorporating ancillary data corresponding to elevation and bathymetry and a combination of algorithms may improve discharge estimates although the initial results are encouraging there is still scope for improvement in the algorithms to obtain accurate discharge estimates 3 2 2 terrestrial water storage the terrestrial water storage tws accounts for all the water available above and below the surface of the earth and forms an important component of the hydrologic cycle however it is difficult to measure tws at a regional or global scale lettenmaier and famiglietti 2006 in this regard the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellite mission launched in march 2002 proves to be advantageous the grace mission was primarily aimed at mapping temporal variability in earth s gravitation field at 400 to 40 000 km spatial resolution and 30 days interval tapley et al 2004b grace has shown promising results in inferring trends in surface water mass anomalies crowley et al 2006 schmidt et al 2006 tapley et al 2004a wahr et al 2004 changes in the tws δ t w s are estimated from the grace data using eq 15 and 16 frappart and ramillien 2018 kuss et al 2012 15 δ t w s δ s w s δ s m s δ s p s δ g w s wherein 16 δ t w s t w s grace t 2 t w s grace t 1 tw s grace t 1 and tw s grace t 2 indicate the total water storage obtained from the grace data at time 1 and time 2 respectively difference between tw s grace t 2 and tw s grace t 1 gives the tws anomaly as shown in eq 16 δ s w s is the surface water storage anomaly δ s m s is soil moisture storage anomaly δ s p s is snowpack storage anomaly and δ g w s is groundwater storage anomaly to determine δ g w s the eq 15 can be rewritten as eq 17 17 δ g w s δ t w s δ s w s δ s m s δ s p s wherein δ t w s can be obtained from the grace data eq 16 and the remaining variables can be obtained from other remote sensing sources or hydrologic model outputs initial works demonstrated the use of grace data in monitoring groundwater storage changes rodell and famiglietti 2002 rodell et al 2007 rodell et al 2009 crowley et al 2006 showed the capability of grace data in estimating tws for the congo basin during 2002 2006 syed et al 2008 carried out a detailed analysis to show the use of grace data in understanding spatio temporal variability in tws changes at the continental scale the grace data is also found to be useful in monitoring groundwater changes in groundwater dependent irrigated areas famiglietti et al 2011 rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 and groundwater depletion feng et al 2013 apart from direct tws measurements the grace data is also assimilated into land surface models to improve simulations of hydrologic fluxes and water storage eicker et al 2014 khaki et al 2018a khaki et al 2018b li et al 2019 li et al 2012 tian et al 2017 zaitchik et al 2008 grace data is also used in combination with other datasets to estimate floodplain storage alsdorf et al 2010 reager and famiglietti 2009 segregating tws into surface water storage and land water storage forootan et al 2014 terrestrial freshwater discharge li et al 2016 syed et al 2009 syed et al 2010 and soil moisture and shallow groundwater estimation girotto et al 2019 since the grace data is available at coarse resolution it is incompatible with other hydrological datasets landerer and swenson 2012 showed the accuracy of various scaling techniques to estimate tws observations at 1 1 resolution this enables the use of grace data for closing the water balance at a regional scale other studies related to the applications of the grace data in determining water storage changes include cao et al 2019a b c gonçalves et al 2019 jing et al 2020 meng et al 2019 van dijk et al 2011 voss et al 2013 and wang et al 2011 the grace mission ended in 2017 and is continued through grace follow on grace fo mission which was launched in may 2018 the grace fo carries a laser interferometry system to improve ranging precision between the two satellites sheard et al 2012 the advancements in the grace fo mission are likely to provide improvement in surface mass anomalies pertaining to terrestrial water storage and ice sheets and adding further insights to the hydrological studies frappart and ramillien 2018 3 2 3 monitoring of reservoirs reservoirs play an important role in ensuring water security of a region particularly during extreme drought events mishra and singh 2010 reservoir monitoring is critical for the river basin management system as they regulate inter seasonal and inter annual fluctuations in streamflow gao et al 2012 reservoirs also help in flood control hydroelectric power generation facilitating continuous water supply and other recreational activities despite their manifold importance observations on water storage in reservoirs are either lacking or difficult to access with the advent of radar altimetry it has become possible to monitor the large reservoirs remotely to estimate water storage in reservoirs both surface water area and bathymetry measurements are required with this intent the data from multiple altimeters along with the modis data were used to create a time series of 34 global reservoir storages gao et al 2012 geoscience laser altimeter system glas of the ice cloud and land elevation satellite icesat was used to extract storage information for 21 reservoirs in south asia zhang et al 2014 the saral dataset was used to monitor the maithon reservoir in jharkhand india ghosh et al 2015 bonnema and hossain 2019 evaluated the ability of the swot mission to model changes in reservoir storage in the mekong river basin for lake and reservoir monitoring okeowo et al 2017 developed an algorithm to directly extract water level information from the jason 2 and envisat radar altimeters to develop reservoir time series this development may assist a large hydrologic community which may have little knowledge in this field in addition to directly using the altimeter data the potential of assimilating altimeter data corresponding to reservoirs from different altimeter datasets for accurate river basin modeling is also explored cardenal et al 2011 michailovsky and bauer gottwein 2014 3 3 extreme events 3 3 1 floods floods are one of the worst natural disasters that have the greatest impact on life food and water security globally floods incurred economic losses up to usd 56 billion in 2016 wing et al 2018 in march 2019 alone global costs due to flooding are estimated to be around usd 8 billion podlaha et al 2019 some of the consequences of floods include anoutbreak of waterborne diseases kondo et al 2002 crop damage rosenzweig et al 2002 and drinking water contamination sirajul islam et al 2007 among others these factors affect the sustainability of water resources so there is a need to develop strategies to monitor and manage floods in a basin some of the necessary steps include a determining the vulnerable regions that get frequently affected due to floods in a region and subsequently establish appropriate legislation in terms of land use planning and management b development of control and diversion structures that take shocks in the case of flash floods and extreme precipitation events and c development of independent infrastructure to drain floodwaters in urban landscapes these steps require continuous monitoring of water level flood volume and flood extent which are the three factors that determine the severity of floodin a basin it is important to note that in situ gauge sensors are expensive to monitor and are susceptible to damage during heavy flood events which hinders the data acquisition process under these circumstances there is a need to rely on satellite remote sensing information to monitor floods over the past two decades there is an increased awareness among space agencies to utilize remote sensing information to monitor floods typically optical passive and active microwave sensors are used to monitor floods in this section we review the role of satellite remote sensing for monitoring the flood extent we review the remote sensing applications in streamflow detection which includes water depth detection in section 4 2 1 3 3 1 1 flood extent using optical sensors in the visible and thermal electromagnetic radiation spectrum water has a relatively low reflectivity compared to other land cover types this is the principle based on which flood monitoring is carried out using optical sensors details regarding some of the operational optical satellite sensors including avhrr viirs modis sentinel landsat spot aster ikonos quickbird worldview rapideye ziyuan 3 zy 3 and gaofen missions among others used for this purpose can be found in table 1 typically optical remote sensing signals include blue 0 45 0 52 μm for landsat 4 5 7 and 8 missions 0 45 0 48 μm for modis green 0 50 0 57 μm red 0 61 0 70 μm near infrared nir 0 7 0 9 μm and mid infrared mir 1 5 3 μm bands several indices have been proposed in the past that evolved from using reflectance information from using band ratios to using a combination of multiple indices ma et al 2019 these indices are useful in assessing the flood extent by classifying the areas of dry and inundated regions tasseled cap wetness tcw index crist 1985 crist and cicone 1984 is the earliest water index which is derived as a combination of six bands of reflectance information sourced from landsat a threshold of 0 is set to identify water bodies normalized difference water index ndwi proposed by mcfeeters 1996 is one of the widely used water indices it is expressed as a ratio of ρ green ρ nir and ρ green ρ nir where ρ is surface reflectance however ndwi cannot separate the presence of water in built up areas due to similar reflective characteristics of these two features in green and nir bands zhou et al 2017 xu 2006 addressed this issue by replacing nir with swir resulting in the ratio between ρ green ρ swir and ρ green ρ swir however this method cannot delineate water bodies in snow cover regions huang et al 2018 table 6 presents a summary of the water extraction indices proposed in the literature further information on the use of optical sensors in flood detection can be obtained from huang et al 2018 ma et al 2019 and zhou et al 2017 in the thermal spectrum few studies have utilized the diurnal land surface temperature difference as an indicator to detect flood inundation ordoyne and friedl 2008 parinussa et al 2016 despite their ease of applicability information from optical sensors is affected by the atmosphere in the form of clouds and particulate matter and vegetation besides image acquisition can be carried out only during the daytime in case of the presence of clouds or vegetation the reflectance from these features can be so prominent that the image may not be useful to monitor floods in real time it is therefore necessary to use information from microwave sensors for the flood monitoring process 3 3 1 2 flood extent using active microwave sensors active microwave sensors emit their signals of electromagnetic radiations in microwave frequencies towards the earth surface and measure the scattered signal in the form of backscatter coefficient which contains information about the surface s texture shape and its dielectric properties woodhouse 2017 active microwave radar sensors can penetrate through clouds with less attenuation sanyal and lu 2004 and also provide information independent of solar illumination moreira et al 2013 their ability to acquire information in the order of ten to hundreds of meters provides an opportunity to monitor floods on rivers with a width of less than 1 km mason et al 2011 schumann et al 2009 some of the operational synthetic aperture radar sar microwave satellite missions include alos 2 saocom 1a radarsat 2 risat 1 cosmo skymed and terrasar x among others details regarding these sensors can be found in table 1 the spatial and temporal resolutions of sar imagery are critical factors for flood monitoring there is an inherent tradeoff between these two resolutions generally the spatial and temporal resolutions of sar imagery will be in the order of 1 100 m and 11 46 days respectively di baldassarre et al 2011 schumann et al 2009 to counteract the issue of low temporal resolution space agencies are launching constellations of satellites which work together for example the sentinel 1 mission is a constellation of two satellites which combinedly reduce the global revisit time to 6 days geudtner et al 2014 torres et al 2012 the revisit time is reduced further to 5 days with the follow up mission of sentinel 2 drusch et al 2012 which is launched in 2016 besides the cosmo skymed mission is also a constellation of four satellites which can provide high resolution sar imagery with a revisit time as low as 2 h covello et al 2010 the reduced revisit time will aid in flood monitoring as was implemented successfully in the past the backscatter coefficient recorded in a sar imagery is influenced by the characteristics of target and sensor such as a surface roughness and b dielectric properties of target affect the backscatter coefficient c frequency of radiation d polarization e incidence angle f properties of atmosphere and g meteorological conditions such as rainfall wind speed etc the frequency of radiation has an inverse effect on the depth of penetration of the backscatter signal ulaby et al 1982 generally backscatter coefficients from l 0 5 1 5 ghz c 4 8 ghz and x 8 12 ghz bands frequencies are found to be useful for flood monitoring studies with l band having a greater ability to penetrate through vegetation and relatively lesser influence due to roughness grimaldi et al 2016 schumann et al 2012 the sensitivity of the backscatter coefficient to surface roughness increases with increasing angles and vice versa ulaby et al 1982 water bodies generally appear darker with low backscatter signal unless affected by water surface roughness or wind stress bragg scatter costa et al 2006 freeman and durden 1998 before analyzing the sar data it is important to pre process the imageries in terms of geo referencing process of locating the image on the earth ortho rectification process of correcting the systematic sensor and platform induced geometry errors and speckle removal process of filtering the noise that persists in the backscatter signal grimaldi et al 2016 several approaches have been developed in the past that map the flood extent using the sar imageries these methods can be called as image classification techniques since the prime objective is to differentiate the locations that are dry and wet inundated these methods can be broadly classified into a visual interpretation b image thresholding c automatic image classification algorithms d active contour models and e change detection techniques it has to be noted that each of these techniques has its advantages and disadvantages and there is no optimal technique that applies to all case studies di baldassarre et al 2011 grimaldi et al 2016 schumann et al 2009 the visual interpretation involves the examination of flood lines from imageries although this method is a straightforward way to map the flood extent the outcome can be erroneous due to the influence of factors such as flooded regions appearing to be brighter due to roughness and wind effects some of the studies that implemented this technique include brivio et al 2002 giustarini et al 2016 macintosh and profeti 1995 oberstadler et al 1997 image thresholding is an efficient and simplest approach for image classification landuyt et al 2018 in these techniques a radiometric threshold value is determined to differentiate two classes flood non flood areas that have significantly different pixel distributions image thresholding techniques can be broadly classified as follows sezgin and sankur 2004 1 histogram shape based methods analyze the peaks and valleys among other properties of the smoothened histogram of image guo and pandit 1998 martinis et al 2009 ramesh et al 1995 rosenfeld and de la torre 1983 sezan 1990 2 clustering based methods which separate the image into two clusters that correspond to water and non water pixels chang et al 2010 cho et al 1989 jawahar et al 1997 otsu 1979 ridler and calvard 1978 schumann et al 2010 3 entropy based methods determine the entropy of the two clusters and the cross entropy between the original and binarized images cheng et al 1999 kapur et al 1985 rajinikanth et al 2018 sahoo et al 1997 sarkar et al 2016 4 object attribute based methods which assess the similarity between original and binarized images dasgupta et al 2018 hertz and schafer 1988 martinis et al 2009 pikaz and averbuch 1996 pulvirenti et al 2011 5 spatial methods which use probability distributions between the pixels brivio et al 2002 cao et al a b c the threshold value obtained from the above described techniques is dependent on satellite sensors land surface and environmental conditions so these techniques have to be applied on a scene by scene basis consequently these techniques turn out to be time consuming and are also prone to errors due to the subjectivity of the image in focus automatic thresholding techniques try to alleviate this problem by determining automatically the threshold gray value that separates the flood and non flood values these techniques vary according to the estimation of the threshold at a global scale single threshold for the whole image pal and pal 1993 or local scale threshold according to local conditions sahoo et al 1988 they also differ based on the involvement of parameters in the models leading to parametric and nonparametric models some of the automated methods were proposed by chini et al 2017 giustarini et al 2012 martinis et al 2015 martinis et al 2009 matgen et al 2011 and wan et al 2019 for instance martinis et al 2015 s technique involves the division of sar image into non overlapping tiles and an iterative procedure is adopted to select representative tiles that have a histogram with strong bimodality this technique is implemented as an on demand terrasar x based flood determination service which is extended to sentinel 1c band data twele et al 2016 active contour models acm also called as snakes are one of the widely used automatic techniques for flood extent delineation caselles et al 1993 chan and vese 2001 cohen 1991 horritt 1999 horritt et al 2001 kass et al 1988 acms involve a dynamic curvilinear contour which evolves subject to image constraints to determine objects of the image contours are a set of nodes connected with straight lines the objects in the context of floods can be land and flood inundated areas the contour is driven by an energy function which attracts the contour towards the edges of the object this energy function considers the changes in backscatter coefficients inside the region the changes in backscatter coefficients outside the region and an edge length parameter debusscher and van coillie 2019 this search process continues until the flooded area is identified several studies implemented acms for the detection of flood inundation bates et al 1997 bates et al 2006 de roo et al 1999 debusscher and van coillie 2019 horritt 1999 horritt et al 2001 landuyt et al 2018 schumann et al 2012 the methods described above deal single image change detection methods on the other hand use two images non flooding and post flooding of the same region of interest through these two images the difference in the backscatter coefficients can be obtained which can be used further for delineating the inundated areas the difference in the two images is calculated generally as a ratio moser and serpico 2006 or log ratio bazi et al 2005 chini et al 2017 to counteract the multiplicative nature of speckle in the sar data hostache et al 2012 noticed that the selection of reference non flooding images could significantly affect the output from change detection techniques this is due to the high variability of backscatter coefficients as a result of atmospheric components land surface processes such as soil moisture evapotranspiration seasonality in the vegetation characteristics land use changes and the image acquisition characteristics in this context moya et al 2019 identified that change detection could cause false detection of floods in agricultural areas and attempted to address this issue by proposing a new parameter that is helpful to determine if the detected change is attributed to either flooded or non flooded area in the agricultural region recently landuyt et al 2018 compared a couple of thresholding techniques acm and change detection using sar images of several flood events that occurred in the uk and ireland they indicate that acms can produce flood maps at greater accuracy at the expense of computational resources whereas martinis et al 2015 s automated thresholding technique is suitable for near real time flood detection and monitoring efforts are made to include multiple techniques in order to obtain much accurate flood maps for example matgen et al 2011 proposed an automated sar flood monitoring system wherein they used both thresholding and change detection techniques long et al 2014 proposed change detection and thresholding cdat method for flood extent delineation in caprivi region of namibia 3 3 1 3 flood extent using passive microwave sensors passive microwave radiometers capture the naturally emitted electromagnetic radiations from the earth s surface in the form of brightness temperatures due to the differences in the thermal inertia and the emissivity of land and water the brightness temperatures recorded by the satellite are colder over the water surface this contrast in brightness temperatures is generally utilized for detecting flood inundated regions choudhury 1989 hamilton et al 1996 schmugge 1987 smith 1997 in this context brakenridge et al 2007 developed a technique that uses horizontal polarization ka band 37 ghz frequency information in this work the ratio between the brightness temperature of the target grid cell and a background calibration reference dry grid cell is computed which corresponds to the variations in the discharge and the water extent in the grid cell besides basist et al 1998 proposed a method to determine water extent using the notion of a decrease in emissivity with increase in the fraction of water surface in a pixel they related this emissivity with the difference in brightness temperature across multiple frequencies in this process they derived an index called basin water index bwi which is demonstrated using vertically polarized ssm i 19 37 and 85 ghz frequencies it is important to note that the brightness temperature measurements are only available in the order of tens of kilometers due to the low energy of microwave emissions so it will be possible to assess the flood extent only in the case of large catchments of areas greater than 1000 km2 grimaldi et al 2016 also the microwave signals have noticeable attenuation due to the atmosphere beyond x band frequency prigent et al 2016 karthikeyan et al 2017 so these attenuations should also be accounted for during the retrieval process nevertheless several global flood monitoring systems utilize information from passive microwave sensors for instance global flood detection system version 2 kugler and de groeve 2007 coordinated by global disaster alert and coordination system gdacs in collaboration with dartmouth flood observatory produces flood information using amsr2 and global precipitation mission gpm sensors https www gdacs org flooddetection overview aspx there are certain merits and demerits associated with each of these optical active and passive microwave products recognizing the need to combine the strengths of each of these sensors to obtain flood information with improved accuracy efforts have been to develop multi satellite global flood monitoring systems prigent et al 2001 developed global inundation extent from multi satellites giems prigent et al 2016 which combines information from ssm i passive microwave sensor ers european remote sensing satellite active microwave sensor and avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer optical sensor to provide monthly global inundation maps at 25 km resolution over the period 1993 2007 furthermore schroeder et al 2015 developed surface water microwave product series swamps by combining information from passive sensors ssm i ssmis special sensor microwave imager sounder active sensors ers quikscat and ascat advanced scatterometer an optical sensor modis swamps produced global scale surface water fraction maps at 25 km covering the period 1992 2013 recently parrens et al 2019 developed a 1 km inundation product at three days temporal resolution over the amazon basin using information from soil moisture ocean salinity smos landsat and shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem over the period 2010 2016 3 3 2 droughts the demand for water has increased significantly due to the growth of population and expansion of agricultural energy and industrial sectors which resulted in frequent water scarcityin many parts of the world mishra and singh 2010 the water scarcity is aggravated by droughts that impact surface and groundwater resources leading to reduced water supply deteriorated water quality risk of wildfires taufik et al 2017 livestock murray tortarolo and jaramillo 2019 food production cottrell et al 2019 water stress pedro monzonís et al 2015 shah and mathur 2019 among others therefore drought management related investigation e g monitoring forecasting and risk assessment is essential for the planning and management of water resources droughts are triggered by the anomalous behavior in hydroclimatic variables such as reduction in precipitation increase in temperatures low relative humidity and distribution of rainy days mishra and singh 2010 with the advent of satellite remote sensing it is now possible to track the anomalous behavior of such variables at different spatio temporal scales droughts are classified broadly into meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic droughts mishra and singh 2010 although there is no standard definition of drought mukherjee et al 2018 it generally originates due to the deficit of water compared to normal conditions van loon et al 2016 since droughts are associated with the movement of water in the hydrological cycle the droughts mentioned above are intricately related to each other in this context several drought indices have been proposed in the past that assess the individual as well as the multivariate nature of droughts rajsekhar et al 2015 the following sections present the applications of remote sensing towards assessing meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts 3 3 2 1 meteorological drought meteorological drought is associated with the lack of occurrence of precipitation over a duration mishra and singh 2010 traditionally the meteorological drought analysis is carried out using in situ precipitation information zuo et al 2019 palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 is used as a meteorological drought index and it measures the departure of the moisture supply based on the supply and demand concept of the water balance equation the pdsi is calculated by accounting precipitation and temperature data as well as the local available water content of the soil several limitations of pdsi palmer 1965 mishra and singh 2010 are addressed through self calibrating pdsi spdsi wells et al 2004 there are limited studies that incorporated remote sensing information to derive pdsi for example yan et al 2014 incorporated remotely sensed global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms leaf area index lai based et in to spdsi to carry out drought assessment at the global scale standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 is another meteorological drought index which is calculated using long term precipitation data at a given location spi involves fitting precipitation to an appropriate probability distribution and then transforming it to a normal distribution since the spi requires only precipitation data it is one of the widely used meteorological drought indices however there is a need for at least 30 years of precipitation data to obtain a reliable statistical fit while estimating the spi with the advent of long term remote sensing based products such as chirps climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station funk et al 2015 and mswep multi source weighted ensemble precipitation beck et al 2019 it is now possible to determine spi using this information for instance bayissa et al 2017 used chirps data to monitor meteorological drought in ethiopia shrestha et al 2017 assessed the accuracy of the spi estimates of chirps over the koshi basin nepal and observed that spi values identified historical droughts recently golian et al 2019 compared the spi of chirps and mswep along with reanalysis and gauge based precipitation datasets at global scale they found that the drought indices are sensitive to the choice of precipitation dataset its length and spatial resolution in addition some more drought indices are proposed that utilize remote sensing data anderson et al 2011 and anderson et al 2007 developed remote sensing based evaporative stress index esi which represents the temporal anomalies in the ratio between actual evapotranspiration aet and potential evapotranspiration pet the esi is computed using tir and vegetation cover fraction imagery of geostationary operational environmental satellites goes kim and rhee 2016 proposed standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi a fully et based index that is derived using the complementary relationship between evaporative demand and aet vicente serrano et al 2018 used gleam aet estimates to carry out drought assessment using sedi at global scale since esi and sedi are independent of rainfall they can be used as a reference to evaluate the precipitation based meteorological drought indices recognizing the need to include evapotranspiration while characterizing meteorological drought vicente serrano et al 2010 proposed a new multiscalar drought index named the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei spei works similar to spi with the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet as the random variable of interest this difference essentially provides climatic water balance i e whether there exists a water surplus or water deficit in a particular month in a recent study zhao and ma 2019 considered trmm chirps and persiann cdr precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record ashouri et al 2015 hsu et al 1997 along with other precipitation products to estimate spei at the global scale they found persiann cdr to be relatively more suitable for long term drought monitoring purposes similar to spei reconnaissance drought index rdi tsakiris et al 2007 is a meteorological drought index computed as a ratio between accumulated rainfall and pet dalezios et al 2012 determined rdi for drought assessment using remotely sensed information based pet and station rainfall data in greece zhang and jia 2013 proposed microwave integrated drought index midi that considers trmm precipitation amsr e derived land surface temperature and soil moisture for monitoring short term meteorological drought zhang et al 2019a attempted to improve meteorological drought monitoring using multi satellite precipitation products with midi in tropical and subtropical water limited climates they found multi satellite midi estimates to correlate well with spi and spei 3 3 2 2 agricultural drought agricultural drought occurs due to a decline in soil moisture which subsequently leads to the failure of crops mishra and singh 2010 the lack of water in the soil can be attributed to a deficit in rainfall or lack of irrigation due to lack of water in the reservoirs along with a greater amount of evapotranspiration from the soil therefore agricultural drought monitoring is carried out primarily by analyzing the patterns of vegetation and soil moisture agricultural drought is also intricately related to the meteorological conditions several studies indicated the link between the agricultural drought and precipitation anomalies elagib 2013 kurnik et al 2011 rouault and richard 2003 svoboda et al 2012 so attempts are made to study agricultural drought in an integrated manner we find that there is a relatively greater number of agricultural drought indices compared to the meteorological drought indices proposed in the literature pdsi has an issue of reacting slowly to short term droughts which if overlooked can impact the monitoring of crop growth narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 crop moisture index cmi developed by palmer 1968 attempts to alleviate this problem it is calculated based on pet and soil moisture depletion with soil water balance as a governing concept on a similar idea relative soil moisture rsm thornthwaite and mather 1955 agricultural drought index dtx matera et al 2007 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 noted that cmi similar to pdsi has limitations of assuming uniform properties of land use and soil in a climatic zone they attempted to address this issue through new indices called the soil moisture deficit index smdi and evapotranspiration deficit index etdi by simulating soil moisture and et using soil water assessment tool swat attempts are made to analyze multiple types of droughts by using the water energy balance equation ayantobo and wei 2019 zhang et al 2019b similar to the computation of spi standardized soil moisture index ssi can be derived based on the soil moisture information mishra et al 2015 aghakouchak 2015 zhang et al 2019d computed weekly ssi using esa cci soil moisture product for agricultural drought monitoring of the yellow river basin china with the advent of remote sensing information several compatible agricultural drought indices are proposed hunt et al 2009 and sridhar et al 2008 proposed the soil moisture index smi which is calculated as a function of the ratio of the difference between soil moisture and wilting point and the difference between field capacity and wilting point recently martínez fernández et al 2015 modified the smi to propose soil water deficit index swdi wherein the soil moisture deficit is limited by field capacity instead of wilting point in the numerator given its advantage of being independent of the length of the record swdi can be applied even on shorter soil moisture time series mishra et al 2017 used smap soil moisture to generate swdi to monitor agricultural drought over the contiguous united states conus carrão et al 2016 proposed empirical standardized soil moisture index essmi using esa cci soil moisture data by estimating the standard normal variates of empirical distribution of soil moisture at various timescales in terms of characterizing the agricultural drought corresponding to vegetation the normalized vegetation difference index ndvi tucker 1979 is probably the most famous remote sensing based index it is calculated as the ratio of difference between reflectance of near infrared nir and red r bands and the sum of nir and r bands of an optical satellite airborne sensor ndvi indicates the condition of vegetation healthy or unhealthy and its presence however it is associated with certain limitations zargar et al 2011 this resulted in alternate vegetation indices such as enhanced vegetation index evi liu and huete 1995 soil adjusted vegetation index savi epiphanio and huete 1995 huete 1988 normalized difference water index ndwi gao 1996 and normalized multi band drought index nmdi wang and qu 2007 furthermore vegetation condition index vci kogan 1990 is a scaled version of ndvi computed as vc i t ndv i t n d v i min ndv i max n d v i min at time t that removes the effects of weather in ndvi and determines the health of vegetation it is used extensively for agricultural drought monitoring in the literature quiring and ganesh 2010 estimated vci using advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr to assess the possibility of using vci as a meteorological drought indicator in texas in a similar attempt zambrano et al 2016 carried out agricultural drought monitoring with vci using modis mod13q1 ndvi product over cropland areas in chile and compared the outcome with station based spi similar to vci temperature condition index tci is proposed to determine how vegetation reacts to temperature tci ls t max l s t ls t max l s t min kogan 1995 apart from the above indices some of the hybrid drought indices are also proposed in the literature that considers remote sensing information can input as an extension of vci and tci kogan 1995 introduced the vegetation health index vhi which is a linear combination of tci and vci mostly an equal weight is assigned to tci and vci while calculating vhi kogan 1997 recently bachmair et al 2018 compared modis based vci and vhi with spi and spei over europe under crop and forest land cover conditions brown et al 2008 developed an integrated drought index called the vegetation drought response index vegdri that uses climate satellite and biophysical variables in a statistical regression framework similarly rhee et al 2010 proposed scaled drought condition index sdci for monitoring agricultural droughts sdci is computed as a linear combination of scaled modis lst ndvi and trmm precipitation using a linear combination of ratios of et and pet and ndvi mu et al 2013 proposed drought severity index dsi which is based on modis products vyas et al 2015 proposed a combined deficit index cdi to characterize agricultural drought it is based linear combination of remotely sensed rainfall and ndvi datasets zuo et al 2019 used cdi to assess agricultural drought in northeast china liu et al 2017b used the relationship between satellite brightness temperature from amsr e and ndvi from modis to develop microwave temperature vegetation drought index mtvdi while determining an integrated agricultural drought response it is essential to note that vegetation exhibits lagged response to the meteorological drought due to the residual soil moisture content and the soil moisture memory anderson et al 2012 di et al 1994 therefore it is important to consider this lag for the accurate characterization of the agricultural drought in this context sánchez et al 2016 proposed soil moisture agricultural drought index smadi by integrating the soil moisture condition index smci formulation of which is similar to that of vci a modified version of tci and lagged vci smadi is found to capture the agricultural droughts when tested using smos soil moisture modis lst and ndvi at global scale sánchez et al 2018 the multivariate drought indices are recently derived from integrate different types of drought rajsekhar et al 2015 kao and govindaraju 2010 proposed the joint deficit index jdi that utilized copulas to estimate probability based integrated drought index by considering multiple drought indices hao et al 2014 developed the multivariate standardized drought index msdi which is the normalization of the joint probability of accumulated rainfall and soil moisture recently attempts are made to assess the agricultural droughts using the water balance equation cao et al a b c further information on the multivariate drought indices can be obtained from hao and singh 2015 3 3 2 3 hydrological drought hydrological drought is associated with the deficit in surface and subsurface water resources mishra and singh 2010 the meteorological drought can trigger agricultural drought which can lead to hydrological drought sheffield and wood 2007 sheffield et al 2012 traditionally the streamflow anomalies are analyzed to identify the periods of hydrological drought keyantash and dracup 2002 palmer hydrological drought index phdi palmer and drought 1965 is the earliest hydrological drought index phdi works similar to pdsi whereas pdsi considers the end of drought as the moisture deficit begins to subside gradually phdi considers the end of drought when the moisture deficit is subsided completely to assess the hydrological drought heim 2000 keyantash and dracup 2002 phdi does not work in the basins which have snowmelt runoff contribution in the streamflow shukla and wood 2008 developed the surface runoff index sri to characterize hydrological drought to the best of our knowledge no studies have been carried out that integrated remote sensing information into these drought indices in this context west et al 2019 noted that there is relatively limited research in the area of quantifying hydrological droughts compared to that of meteorological and agricultural droughts the launch of grace and its follow on missions in 2002 and 2018 respectively flechtner et al 2014 tapley et al 2004b opened up possibilities of estimating the terrestrial water storage tws components of soil moisture surface and subsurface water in a basin with these missions the research on the application of remote sensing to investigate hydrological groundwater drought flourished the difference between monthly tws anomalies and climatology of tws anomalies with subsequent transformation was applied to identify hydrological droughts sinha et al 2017 thomas et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 yirdaw et al 2008 developed the total storage deficit index tsdi by standardizing the monthly tws anomaly and then combining the outcome at a timestep with that of that previous timestep through an arithmetic weighted summation recently forootan et al 2019 derived a multivariate drought index based on the precipitation and tws to conduct global hydrological drought assessment along with their relationship with climatic teleconnections furthermore grace data is assimilated into hydrological models to study hydrological drought schumacher et al 2018 given its coarse resolution attempts are being made to downscale the grace tws data using hydrological models which can assist in monitoring hydrological droughts zhang et al 2019c groundwater is a crucial component of the hydrological cycle mishra and singh 2010 define groundwater drought as the situation of the below normal groundwater level since the grace mission provides information regarding groundwater storage several studies used grace data to assess groundwater drought the separation of groundwater components from tws estimates is carried out generally using the water balance equation or by using the simulations of land surface models grace estimates are helpful to identify groundwater depletion in a region asoka et al 2017 castle et al 2014 famiglietti et al 2011 huang et al 2015 long et al 2013 richey et al 2015 rodell et al 2009 zhao et al 2019 attempts are being made to utilize grace tws estimates in tandem with interferometric sar data and gps measurement sensors to determine the groundwater depletion castellazzi et al 2018 liu et al 2019 ojha et al 2018 rateb and kuo 2019 some studies assimilated grace data into hydrological models to assess the groundwater depletion döll et al 2014 khaki et al 2018 such grace based data assimilation techniques also carried out to investigate the groundwater droughts li and rodell 2015 li et al 2019 van loon et al 2017 used grace tws anomalies along with hydrological model simulations are to assess the 2015 european groundwater drought on a similar note mishra et al 2016 conducted drought assessment over india using grace anomalies recently thomas et al 2017 proposed grace groundwater drought index ggdi based on normalized grace groundwater storage deviations to study groundwater drought in california central valley recent studies attempted to assimilate the grace data into land surface models to improve the accuracy of groundwater storage information which is expected to contribute towards drought monitoring purposes getirana et al 2019 li et al 2019 3 3 2 4 drought prediction using remote sensing remote sensing information is also used for drought forecasting purposes the drought forecasting is carried out using either statistical models or physical models in an assimilation framework hao et al 2018 in the case of statistical models time series prediction models or regression models are established between appropriate predictors and remotely sensed datasets such as spi spei ndvi vtci soil moisture and tws anomalies among others de linage et al 2014 mishra and desai 2005 2006 mishra et al 2007 park et al 2018 rhee and im 2017 on the other hand remote sensing products are ingested into land surface models in a data assimilation framework to carry out short term as well as long term prediction of droughts mishra and singh 2011 sheffield et al 2014 liu et al 2017 yan et al 2017 satellite remote sensing products are also being utilized in drought early warning systems funk et al 2019 pozzi et al 2013 tadesse et al 2014 3 3 2 5 regional drought analysis using remote sensing regional drought analysis can generate spatio temporal drought information which plays an important role to improve water resources management at a regional scale mishra and singh 2011 the regional analysis integrates different components of the drought characteristics such as duration severity area and frequency mishra and singh 2009 2011 the regional analysis can be carried out using different variables such as drought indices rainfall streamflow and soil moisture alijanian et al 2019 dabanlı et al 2017 hisdal et al 2001 mishra and singh 2009 and these variables can be obtained derived from the remote sensing products the regional drought analysis typically combines more than one drought characteristics for example intensity duration frequency curves hallack alegria and watkins 2007 total areal deficit and maximum deficit intensity tase 1976 severity area duration sad curves andreadis et al 2005 the gauged precipitation data can be used for regional drought analysis or these data can be used to derive standardized precipitation index spi for regional drought assessment mishra and desai 2005 mishra and singh 2008 bonaccorso et al 2015 cai et al 2015 dabanlı et al 2017 the regional drought information is critical for water resources management mishra and singh 2011 alijanian et al 2019 therefore it is important to investigate the regional or spatial behavior of droughts panu and sharma 2002 mishra and singh 2011 bonaccorso et al 2015 especially for data scarce regions mishra and singh 2011 however one of the key limitations is lack of high quality and continuous hydroclimate data to capture spatial coverage in many parts of the world mishra and singh 2011 to overcome such limitations long term satellite datasets can be a reliable alternative source for drought assessments in un gauged basins some of the examples of long term up to 30 years satellite rainfall products are persiann cdr beck et al 2017 and mswep beck et al 2017 although a number of studies investigated the performance of satellite rainfall products for temporal drought analysis limited number of studies investigated the regional drought analysis alijanian et al 2019 in a recent study alijanian et al 2019 evaluated the performance of satellite rainfall estimates persiann cdr and mswep for regional drought analysis for iran and to compare the four major historical severe drought events over the different climatic regions the performance of remote sensing products may differ with respect to gauge data in terms of quantifying drought characteristics e g severity duration and frequency and identification of major historical droughts the performance of selected remote sensing products largely differs in terms of quantifying the frequency component embedded in the regional drought analysis for selected climatic regions located in iran 4 summary in this work we review role of remote sensing in addressing three critical aspects of water security i e i water quality ii water quantity surface and sub surface water resources and iii extreme events this review suggests that the satellite data offers promising results for the monitoring of the aforementioned categories the satellite measurements will increase the observation network to map the water resources globally the use of remotely sensed data for estimating water quality parameters river discharge reservoir monitoring groundwater storage and mapping the extreme events is likely to provide valuable information related to the water availability in order to improve water security of a region following is the summary of the review water quality the spectral properties of clear water are significantly different from polluted water this feature is explored by the remote sensing sensors to monitor water quality the water quality estimation is mostly carried out in the visible region of the spectrum chlorophyll chl concentration turbidity and total suspended solids tss secchi disk depth sdd and colored dissolved organic matter cdom are the most common water quality parameters estimated using the remote sensing datasets attempts are made to establish statistical relationship between water quality parameters and spectral reflectance for this data from landsat modis orbview 2 seawifs meris sentinel 2 and hyperion are increasingly used for chl mapping bandwidths of 675 nm and 700 nm are found to be most useful whereas red and nir bands are found to be useful for turbidity and tss mapping apart from the use of single bands incorporation of reflectance from multiple bands through band ratios is noted to improve water quality parameter estimates by reducing the effect of atmosphere and increasing the signal to noise ratio the sdd is inversely related to turbidity and tss concentration and is therefore estimated using empirical relationships with tss and turbidity similarly cdom is found to be strongly correlated to chl a tss and turbidity levels the lack of extensive availability of remote sensing datasets required for water quality monitoring adds large uncertainties to the estimates highlighting the need for further improvement in the data further most of the algorithms are empirical in nature which requires accurate parameterization that can vary with the optical properties of the water body during recent years the merging of multispectral data with hyperspectral sensor data is also being attempted to accurately determine the water quality parameters water quantity streamflow reservoirs and terrestrial water storage tws contribute to the surface and subsurface water resources in a region satellite altimetric datasets are most commonly used for estimating water levels in rivers and reservoirs a combination of different altimetric datasets is found to be useful for streamflow estimation and reservoir monitoring the earlier altimeter missions were successful in mapping only large rivers and reservoirs due to their large footprint however the recent datasets such as jason 2 jason 3 and saral are capable of monitoring small rivers with varying width besides incorporation of other remotely sensed data pertaining to river widths and paths can significantly improve the river water level estimates apart from altimeter datasets ancillary data pertaining to water surface area channel slope average channel width and velocity of rivers can be obtained from remote sensing datasets and can be used in hydraulic equations to estimate discharge the recent advancements in the data assimilation has shown the potential to improve the water level estimates the upcoming swot mission will be a significant development in estimating river discharge and storage for monitoring changes in tws the grace twin satellite mission is commonly used grace data is also used for mapping groundwater changes and groundwater depletion one of the major limitations of the grace data is its coarse resolution which limits its application at continental scale however efforts are currently being made to disaggregate the tws at fine resolution for hydrologic studies extreme events floods estimation of flood extent is carried out using optical thermal active microwave and passive microwave sensors the optical thermal reflectances are used to develop indices which can indicate the inundated areas and dry areas in a region the applicability of these indices is restricted to daytime cloud free conditions microwave sensors address this issue by providing measurements that have atmosphere penetration capability and are independent of solar illumination in the case of active microwave sensors the sar image after necessary pre processing is subjected to classification algorithms such as image thresholding active contour models and change detection technique etc to identify flooded pixels attempts are made to develop automatic flood extent detection schemes by using a combination of the above methods information from passive microwave sensors can be used to detect the flood extent based on the low emissivity of inundated areas compared to that of dry pixels due to the coarse resolution of brightness temperatures from passive microwave sensors the flood extent analysis can be carried out only on large catchments efforts are in progress to utilize the individual merits of each of the described sensing systems towards the development of global flood inundation maps extreme events droughts satellite remote sensing is used to analyze meteorological agricultural hydrological and groundwater droughts long records of remote sensing based precipitation and et datasets available from the early 1980s are useful to conduct meteorological drought analysis using indices such as spi and spei efforts are made to develop indices to apply with microwave precipitation products in the context of agricultural droughts several drought indices are proposed in the literature which characterizes the persistent soil moisture deficit and vegetation stresses some of the drought indices such as smi swdi essmi etc are developed considering satellite soil moisture products vegetation indices are widely used to determine the vegetation stresses efforts are being made to combine variables affected during agricultural drought such as et lst along with soil moisture and vegetation into drought indices besides such attempts are made through a statistical viewpoint resulting in multivariate drought indices the role of remote sensing in analyzing hydrological and groundwater droughts has become popular with the launch of the grace satellite the tws estimates from grace are used to develop hydrological and groundwater drought indices remote sensing information is now an integral part of drought prediction algorithms the hydrometeorological observations obtained in near real time from operational satellite missions are being utilized in famine early warning systems since remote sensing products have the ability to cover larger spatial extent they are used to carry out regional drought analysis that typically assesses features such as intensity duration frequency severity and area of droughts despite the advantages the systematic differences between the remote sensing products of the same variable may affect the outcome so caution should be exercised while selecting an appropriate product 5 outlook satellite remote sensing plays a vital role in monitoring key hydroclimate variables as well as in managing water resources in this work we review three aspects of the role of remote sensing in assessing water security water quality water quantity and extreme events in this process we reviewed how satellite sensors that measure signals from the earth s surface across various frequencies including optical thermal and microwave spectrum along with gravity field measurements are contributing to the above areas of research we present the following outlook with the wisdom gained from the review most of the water quality parameters such as color dissolved organic matter cdom and secchi disc depth sdd are represented through total suspended sediments there is a need for improvements in the sensing systems as well as retrieval methods that enable direct detection of these parameters at global scales regarding flow estimation most of the research is limited to detecting flows in large rivers such as mekong congo amazon ganga and brahmaputra although the research is still advancing to improving the flow measurement accuracies efforts should also be directed towards developing a framework to monitor rivers of all widths at the global scale besides detecting flows over transboundary rivers with reservoirs pose additional challenges the upcoming swot mission biancamaria et al 2016 is anticipated to address these issues the current altimeters have low temporal resolution in the order of tens of days which makes it challenging to monitor rivers one way of overcoming this limitation is to fuse multi satellite information tourian et al 2013 furthermore since most of the altimeters are intended to monitor ocean surface they have limitations of echoes from land while monitoring inland water bodies tarpanelli et al 2019 which need to be addressed grace and grace fo provide valuable information on the terrestrial water storage which include surface and sub surface water resources efforts should be directed towards downscaling these products for diversifying their applications in the areas of irrigation and drinking water supply among others flood monitoring can be further improved with the usage of multiple satellites that alleviate the issues of cloud cover spatial resolution and overpass time during the flooding event quantifying the anatomy of an agricultural drought remains a challenge due to our limited understanding of root zone soil moisture availability for crop growth mishra et al 2015 therefore there is a need to improve our understanding of soil moisture signals in different types of environments to improve agricultural water management the continuous development in remote sensing products e g smap smos amsr 2 and sentinel missions and assimilating them into land surface model can generate root zone soil moisture das and mohanty 2006 de lannoy and reichle 2016 li et al 2010 liu and mishra 2017 martens et al 2017 reichle et al 2017 reichle et al 2019 to improve agricultural drought management in addition remote sensing soil moisture products can expand the capability to map soil moisture deficit with global coverage and it can significantly compliment to the sparse in situ soil moisture networks the mapping capability of satellite remote sensing products opens a new window on the onset and evolution of droughts at regional to national scale mishra et al 2017 there is a need to ingest the information of varying temporal scales at which the hydro meteorological variables behave while characterizing droughts for instance the role of persistence of soil moisture profile on agricultural droughts is yet to be well understood remote sensing products can be useful for regional drought assessment in ungagged basins remote sensing data should be promoted among the stakeholders to develop regional drought management plans to improve water security by integrating multivariate nature of drought events this is especially important for data scare regions in many parts of the world progress in several of the above mentioned directions requires efforts to develop science to obtain hyper spatio temporal resolution remote sensing products projects such as smos hr high resolution rodríguez fernández et al 2019 which is still at concept stage may fill this requirement credit authorship

5581,water resources are critical to the sustainability of life on earth with a growing population and climate change it is imperative to assess the security of these resources over the past five decades satellite remote sensing has become indispensable in understanding the earth and atmospheric processes satellite sensors have the capability of providing data at global scales which is economical compared to the ground or airborne sensor acquisitions the science community made significant advances over recent years with the help of satellite remote sensing in view of these efforts the current review aims to present a comprehensive review of the role of remote sensing in assessing water security this review highlights the role of remote sensing applications to assess water quality quantity and hydroclimatic extreme events that play an important role in improving water security four water quality parameters namely chlorophyll a turbidity and total suspended solids tss secchi disk depth sdd and colored dissolved organic matter cdom are considered under water quantity assessment we review three aspects streamflow estimation terrestrial water storage and reservoir

models and data assimilation strategies among others in the above areas finally possible future research pathways needed to address the issues faced by the science community are discussed this work is the second of the two part review series wherein the first part deals with the applications of satellite remote sensing for agriculture management keywords water security remote sensing water quality streamflow terrestrial water storage floods droughts reservoir monitoring 1 introduction from the available water resources only about 2 5 of the total amount of water on the earth constitutes the freshwater 1 5 of which can be accessed for various biophysical processes the sustainable management of water resources and ensuring water security is vitally important for creating responsible policies to maintain both ecological and economic health of a region mishra and singh 2010 according to the recent un report world population prospects 2019 the world population is projected to increase to 9 7 billion by 2050 and 11 billion by 2100 under a growing population and economy an increase in water demand and global water scarcity is inevitable ipcc 2019 the per capita consumption of water has increased substantially causing an increase in the extraction and use of freshwater resources from 500 km3 year to 3800 km3 year over the last 100 years oki and kanae 2006 further to attain food security there has been a rapid expansion in the crop land areas which is causing over exploitation of groundwater resources for irrigation the use of fertilizers to enhance crop productivity is affecting water quality harming marine and freshwater ecosystems vitousek et al 1997 the increase in industrial water use without proper policies for managing industrial effluents and water recycling especially in developing countries rajaram and das 2008 is raising concerns for maintaining water quality and minimizing water related health problems vörösmarty et al 2010 an imbalance between the development and utility of resources is posing a major challenge to manage water resources the extensive water use has negatively impacted the ecosystem by over exploiting the groundwater reserves and decreasing the drainage areas of lakes rivers and wetlands parry et al 2007 the situation is likely to get worse under the climate change scenario which is expected to influence the freshwater system through an increase in temperature sea level rise rainfall variability and an increase in extreme events parry et al 2007 according to the ipcc ipcc 2019 at 1 5 c rise in temperature 178 million people from the dryland population are vulnerable to water stress this number is estimated to increase to 220 and 270 million people with 2 c and 3 c rise in temperature respectively an increase in the global average surface air temperature during the 20th century houghton et al 2001 is likely to turn some part of snowfall into rainfall and snowmelt season is expected to commence earlier causing change in the timing and volume of snowmelt generated runoff huss and hock 2018 parry et al 2007 the temperature increase and the associated melting of polar ice are very likely to cause a rise in the sea levels resulting in the intrusion of saltwater into groundwater aquifers rendering the groundwater unusable and consequently decreasing the availability of groundwater resources oki and kanae 2006 although there is considerable uncertainty associated with the impact of climate change on the global water cycle chawla and mujumdar 2017 most of the studies indicate its intensification due to an increase in evaporation and consequently precipitation the intensified hydrologic cycle may result in frequent occurrences of extreme events such as drought floods and cyclones which are likely to cause catastrophic damage this may have greater detrimental effects in developing countries due to limited resources for mitigation and adaptation strategies huntington 2006 in addition to the anticipated effects of climate change on the water sector chawla and mujumdar 2015 the increase in water demand along with lack of effective governance is adding to the challenge of maintaining water quality and efficient use of water resources o connell 2017 sheffield et al 2018 1 1 role of remote sensing in water security considering the role of water security in global development the united nations has recognized the provision of clean water and sanitation as one of the sustainable development goals sdgs sdg 6 in particular to achieve the sdgs integrated management of water resources has become the scientific paradigm the management of the availability of water resources under ongoing global scale changes requires continuous monitoring of water availability and its vulnerabilities with space and time mishra and coulibaly 2009 hydro meteorological information e g precipitation streamflow and soil moisture plays a vital role to improve water resource management and to quantify the extreme events however accurate measurement and monitoring of hydro meteorologic variables through in situ observations is challenging because of outdated or non existing socioeconomic data and deteriorating observation network mishra and coulibaly 2009 several studies report a global decline in hydrometric stations rodda et al 1993 shiklomanov et al 2002 mishra and coulibaly 2009 impeding the ability to monitor the availability of resources predict droughts and forecast floods the in situ observation stations are non uniformly distributed and also operate intermittently due to insufficient investment in infrastructure inadequate institutional framework lack of government interest and inability to comprehend the need of long term records leading to a lack of continuous time series of different hydro meteorologic variables pearson 1998 mishra and coulibaly 2009 sheffield et al 2018 in situ hydro climate data observed by gauges provides valuable information for water resources management however these data have key limitations for example lack of spatial coverage and missing data sets in most parts of the globe except in a few developed countries also the existence of a political situation or transboundary water sharing condition may hinder the procurement of data for several important rivers kim et al 2019 due to limitations in ground based observations the availability of remote sensing products has served as an important source for researchers water resources managers and related stakeholders in their endeavors remote sensing is a cost effective method for viewing large water bodies with high temporal coverage and reasonable accuracy which is physically not possible through in situ measurements the large scale coverage of areas by the satellite data helps in understanding the evolution of hazards which is critical for managing resources van dijk and renzullo 2011 this paper part 2 of the two paper series provides a review on the applications of remote sensing data for water security in this regard three important areas are considered in this review 1 water quality assessment 2 water quantity which includes streamflows terrestrial water storage and reservoir monitoring and 3 extreme events which include floods and droughts fig 1 presents a detailed schematic diagram of various areas and sub topics selected for review in this paper 2 overview of remote sensing satellites an overview of satellite sensors mentioned in this review is highlighted in this section table 1 presents a list of optical thermal sensors and tables 2 and 3 present the list of active and passive microwave sensors in addition to sensors that measure signals in the electromagnetic spectrum missions such as gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and its follow on grace follow on measure the gravity field through a pair of satellites which essentially look at each other instead of the earth surface table 4 we also provide the information of operation duration spatial and temporal resolution of each of the sensors 3 remote sensing for assessing water security 3 1 water quality the rapid and continuous growth in the population and industries has led to an increase in the point and non point sources of pollution to water bodies while point sources can be traced to a single source non point sources are diffused in nature and are difficult to track these polluting sources deteriorate the quality of water and affect unique ecosystems of both inland waters such as rivers lakes and reservoirs as well as coastal waters which supports a wide variety of aquatic flora and fauna dekker et al 1995 therefore monitoring water quality is crucial to ascertain the sustainability and usability of water resources the physical chemical and biological properties of water determine the quality of water traditionally these properties were quantified through field and laboratory analysis which can be time consuming and labor intensive bierman et al 2011 glasgow et al 2004 also spatio temporal characteristics of water properties are influenced by several factors such as the location of sampling urbanization land use transitions deforestation and climate change temperature change in particular delpla et al 2009 so in situ surveys over large demographic areas spanning long durations may turn out to be infeasible in this context satellite and airborne sensors can provide information which can be used to efficiently monitor certain water quality parameters such as chlorophyll a suspended sediments turbidity total phosphorus dissolved organic content temperature secchi disk depth heavy metal pollution among others over a large scale since the advent of landsat missions in the 1970s satellite remote sensing information is being increasingly used to assess water quality parameters alparslan et al 2007 bhavsar 1984 dekker and peters 1993 the spectral characteristics of a clear water surface are significantly different from water mixed with impurities or pollutants a clear water body absorbs around 97 99 of the incident energy and reflects only 1 3 of incident radiations büttner et al 1987 this proportion alters with the change in the quality of water with polluted water having higher reflectance further the dominant reflected wavelength changes with change in the constituents of water therefore the presence of different substances in the water body results in unique spectral signatures which are measured by various optical and thermal sensors mounted on different satellites and airborne platforms to monitor water quality a relationship between spectral reflectance and water quality parameters needs to be established büttner et al 1987 ritchie et al 2003 wherein the general form of the relationship is given by eq 1 1 y a b x or y a b x where y is the spectral reflectance measured by the remote sensors x is the water quality parameter of interest and a and b are the empirical factors ritchie et al 1976 showed that water with low sediment concentration has a maximum reflection at 0 55 μm compared to 0 6 μm by water with high sediment concentration the ultraviolet radiations 0 25 0 39 µm get reflected from the water surface and usually contain the information on the presence of oil slicks on water bodies seyhan and dekker 1986 within the visible region due to differences in the absorption and reflection patterns various water quality parameters such as chlorophyll a suspended sediments dissolved organic content among others can be identified büttner et al 1987 beyond the visible range most of the energy is absorbed by the water body this indicates that sensor selection is critical for monitoring water quality as reflected irradiance depends on the parameter to be examined and its concentration ritchie et al 2003 information from landsat alparslan et al 2007 brezonik et al 2005 brivio et al 2001 büttner et al 1987 ritchie et al 1990 modis binding et al 2012 härmä et al 2001 lesht et al 2013 swain and sahoo 2017 orbview 2 seawifs gohin et al 2019 vos et al 2003 satellites have often been used to detect quality of water bodies recently sentinel 2 datasets are also being employed for the study of water quality bonansea et al 2019 sòria perpinyà et al 2020 besides hyperspectral images from sensors such as hyperion are also increasingly used due to their better ability to detect suspended sediments dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll content in water bodies hakvoort et al 2002 thiemann and kaufmann 2002 during recent years attempts are being made to merge hyperspectral sensor data with multispectral sensor data to map water quality gohin et al 2019 östlund et al 2001 the merging of datasets helps in attaining good spectral as well as spatial resolutions which is necessary to determine the quality of water accurately for further details regarding different satellite sensors used for obtaining water quality parameters readers are encouraged to refer to gholizadeh et al 2016 literature suggests that optical remote sensing is widely used to monitor water quality parameters to the best of our knowledge there are limited studies that incorporate other bands of the spectrum such as microwave frequencies for this purpose zhang et al 2002 2003a zhang et al 2003b hence we limit this review to satellite optical sensors in this section we review the role of satellite remote sensing towards estimating four important water quality parameters a chlorophyll a b turbidity and total suspended sediments tss c secchi disk depth sdd and d colored dissolved organic matter cdom 3 1 1 chlorophyll a among different water quality parameters chlorophyll a chl a is one of the most widely examined parameters using remote sensing information it is a photosynthesis pigment that is responsible for causing green color reflect green wavelength while absorbing energy from other wavelengths in plants algae and cyanobacteria its occurrence in water bodies is linked directly to the presence of algal bloom and therefore indicates the extent of eutrophication in water bodies nitrogen and phosphorous are the two compounds sourced from fertilizer runoff and burning fossil fuels that act as catalysts for the growth of algae and causing eutrophication of water bodies although eutrophication is a natural process nutrient loading increases its rate and accelerate the degradation of water bodies li and li 2004 the presence of different chl a concentration in water results in spectral reflectance curve with absorption in the blue 0 4 µm and red 0 7 µm bands and reflectance in green 0 5 µm and near infrared 0 8 µm bands this property is used by various sensors to retrieve the chl a information from water although in most of the studies visible range bands from multispectral sensors are used to estimate chl a brivio et al 2001 dekker and peters 1993 ritchie et al 1990 dekker and peters 1993 and härmä et al 2001 found that it is challenging to determine chl a concentration using multispectral data in water bodies with high suspended sediments therefore narrow bandwidth imageries are necessary to measure chl a concentrations most of the literature suggests that optimum bandwidth to quantify chl a levels is around 675 nm and 700 nm gholizadeh et al 2016 during recent years merged satellite datasets are also being used to monitor chl a gohin et al 2019 other relevant literature wherein different sensors are used to determine the chl a parameter is summarized in table 5 among various satellite sensors landsat tm and etm are found to be most widely used to assess chl a due to high spatio temporal coverage and free availability eq 1 presents a general empirical model that relates water quality parameter with spectral bands dekker and peters 1993 noted that chl a concentrations could be well monitored if more than one spectral band is used subsequently several studies used band ratios which can substantially reduce the effect of atmosphere and increase the signal to noise ratio bhattf et al 2010 dekker and peters 1993 hoogenboom et al 1998 kim et al 2014 lim and choi 2015 thiemann and kaufmann 2002 harding et al 1995 developed the following equation eq 2 to determine chl a content empirically using band ratio 2 lo g 10 chl a a b l o g 10 g with g r 2 2 r 1 r 3 where a and b are constants derived from in situ measurements r 1 r 2 and r 3 are the spectral reflectance at 460 nm 490 nm and 520 nm respectively in addition several other empirical algorithms that employ multiple spectral bands have been developed which include two band algorithm 2bda dall olmo and gitelson 2005 three band algorithm 3bda gitelson et al 2003 dall olmo and gitelson 2005 normalized difference chlorophyll index algorithm ndci mishra and mishra 2012 maximum chlorophyll index mci algorithm binding et al 2013 surface algal bloom index algorithm sabi alawadi 2010 fluorescence line height flh algorithm zhao et al 2010 and normalized green red difference index ngrdi feng et al 2015 the 3bda is found to be useful in quantifying chl a in turbid waters with a wide range of optical complexity moses et al 2009 however it is based on several assumptions such as i absorption by suspended solids beyond 700 nm is same as that of 665 675 nm and can be ignored ii absorption beyond 730 nm is nearly zero and iii back scattering coefficient of chl a is spectrally invariant mishra and mishra 2012 the mci algorithm was found to work well when chl a concentrations range from 10 to 300 mg m 3 it failed in high biomass conditions and with variations in optical properties of water the ndci could work well in turbid productive waters and could also be transferred to other geographical locations without adding any significant uncertainties making it superior to the 2bda 3bda and mci the sabi was found to accurately delineate spatial distributions of algal bloom without getting affected by environmental conditions like aerosol and sun glaze the ngrdi is noticed to perform reasonable in water bodies with extreme turbidity and can also help in delineating potential eutrophication areas furthermore attempts are being made to incorporate empirical orthogonal function eof to measure chl a levels in surface water qi et al 2014 the eof approach considers spectral variance of normalized rayleigh corrected reflectance data at 469 555 645 and 859 nm and relates the observed variance with chl a levels the authors found this method to be useful for chl a concentrations ranging from 3 to 100 μg l however the empirical nature of the algorithm along with limited spectral bands for the aforementioned wavelengths led to significant uncertainties in the results it highlights the need for further improvement in the remotely sensed data besides one of the prime concerns with all the empirical models is that they require accurate parameterization which may vary with the optical properties of the water body mishra and mishra 2012 3 1 2 turbidity and total suspended sediments tss the monitoring of total suspended sediments tss is critical for analyzing river dynamics as it serves as an indicator for water quality and also used in sediment discharge and transport applications peterson et al 2018 the suspended sediments affect water quality by blocking the transmission of light altering the nutrient concentration obstructing channels and reducing dissolved oxygen he et al 2017 the presence of suspended particles causes turbidity in the water body the turbidity of water is directly linked to suspended particles higher the turbidity more the concentration of suspended particles therefore the measurement of turbidity is often considered as a proxy for sediment concentration in the water body rügner et al 2013 wass et al 1997 further tss and turbidity can also be used to indirectly monitor heavy metal concentration in water bodies nasrabadi et al 2016 the presence of tss and consequently turbidity in water bodies increases reflectance from red and nir regions of the electromagnetic spectrum dogliotti et al 2015 feng et al 2012 ritchie et al 1976 ritchie and cooper 1988 this property is used to monitor turbidity and tss parameters different sensors are used to measure different levels of turbidity in the water body the red bands of landsat tm 630 690 nm and spot 610 680 nm sensors and modis 645 nm band are found to be useful in monitoring low turbidity levels ranging from 0 9 to 15 ntu nephelometric turbidity unit bustamante et al 2009 chen et al 2007 goodin et al 1996 meris dataset at 681 nm can measure turbidity in the range 1 25 ntu ouillon et al 2008 apart from single bands different band ratios are also used to quantify tss and turbidity the ratio of green 560 nm and blue 413 nm bands from the meris dataset is used to map turbidity in the range of 1 60 ntu potes et al 2012 the ratio of red 630 690 nm and blue 400 500 nm bands from the landsat dataset is used to monitor high turbidity concentrations ranging from 2 to 997 ntu liversedge 2007 ritchie et al 1976 found out that in general the optimum wavelength to quantify suspended material in water bodies is 700 800 nm several empirical models have been developed to relate spectral reflectance with the concentration of suspended material in water bodies schiebe et al 1992 and harrington et al 1992 developed an empirical model given by eq 3 3 r i b i 1 e c s i where r i is the reflectance corresponding to band i c is the concentration of tss b i represents the reflectance saturation of band i at high tss level and s i gives the tss concentration at 63 saturation reflectance of band i b i and s i are coefficients that are statistically determined due to a lack of generality in empirical models analytical models based on radiation transfer equations rtes are developed for instance volpe et al 2011 developed eqs 4 and 5 using rte to retrieve tss concentration from the reflectance measured by the sensors 4 r 0 5 r 1 1 5 r 5 r r dp 1 e k d k u c h ρ b π e k d k u b h where r is water surface reflectance and is related to other controlling factors such as r which is subsurface reflectance r dp is reflectance for optically deep water k d is vertically averaged diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance k u c is vertically averaged diffuse attenuation coefficient for upwelling radiance from water column scattering k u b is vertically averaged diffuse attenuation coefficient for upwelling radiance from water column scattering ρ b represent the bottom albedo h is the water depth and u b a b where b is backscattering coefficient and a represents the absorption coefficient the rte based model helps in addressing the issues commonly faced in the empirical model such as i interference from the reflection from the bottom of the water body ii accurately knowing the optical properties of water bodies and iii uncertainties in retrieved estimates volpe et al 2011 table 5 summarizes the widely used satellite sensors for quantifying turbidity and tss levels in water bodies from the literature survey it is noticed that landsat tm is the most commonly used dataset for estimating turbidity and tss 3 1 3 secchi disk depth sdd clarity of water body is considered generally as a visual measure for water quality li and li 2004 secchi disk depth sdd is a measure for the water clarity index davies colley and smith 2001 in this method a black and white disk called secchi disk invented by an italian astronomer pietro angelo secchi in 1865 having a diameter ranging from 30 to 100 cm marked with graduated lines is inserted into the water body and noted to the point of disappearance davies colley and smith 2001 the depth of disappearance is known as sdd and is inversely related to turbidity and tss concentration in water bodies the sdd measurement is based on light attenuation principle wherein tyler 1968 and preisendorfer 1986 found that sdd is inversely related to the sum of two light attenuation coefficients c and k as indicated in eq 6 6 sdd g c k where g depends on visible reflectance from the secchi disk and it varies within the range of 6 9 tyler 1968 although sdd is an inexpensive way of monitoring water clarity it is highly subjective and depends on the visual accuracy of the observer sdd is also affected by tides on the water surface heddam 2016 since sdd is related to turbidity and tss concentration in the water body several empirical models have been developed to associate these two parameters some of the relationships are listed in eq 7 9 brezonik 1978 gikas et al 2009 usgs 2014 7 l o g sdd 0 48 0 72 l o g tur 8 l o g sdd 2 11 l o g tss 0 16 9 sdd 11 123 t u r 0 637 where tur indicates turbidity in formazin nephelometric unit fnu and tss represents total suspended sediments in the water body apart from empirical relationships spectral bands from different satellite data are also used directly to measure sdd due to easy monitoring of turbidity and tss levels in the visible range red and blue bands are found to be useful in mapping sdd hellweger et al 2004 used the red band whereas lathrop and lillesand 1986 used the green band from the landsat tm to determine sdd ekercin 2007 found blue green and red bands of the ikonos to explain 98 93 of the variance in sdd according to allee and johnson 1999 the landsat tm red band is most useful in determining the sdd choubey 1998 demonstrated the use of spectral bands of irs 1a liss i satellite data in determining sdd in the tawa reservoir narmada basin india they inferred that concentration and grain size of suspended solids are the main factors that influence sdd wu et al 2008 developed a relationship between sdd and spectral reflectance from landsat tm and modis datasets as indicated in eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 ln s d d 1 133 10 533 l a n d s a t t m blue 13 805 l a n d s a t t m red 11 ln s d d 0 474 15 24 m o d i s blue 21 130 m o d i s red in addition to single bands the ratio between different spectral bands is found to be useful in computing sdd in highly turbid water bodies with low sdd lathrop 1992 giardino et al 2001 found the ratio between blue and green landsat tm bands to be suitable in estimating sdd studies found the ratio of blue and red landsat tm bands as indicated in the general form in eq 12 to be efficient in mapping water clarity in a lake kloiber et al 2002b sawaya et al 2003 chipman et al 2004 similarly nelson et al 2003 found blue to red band ratio from landsat tm to be useful in estimating sdd across 93 lakes in michigan usa while the above works used landsat data sawaya et al 2003 noticed the ratio of ikonos blue and red bands to be better than landsat data for mapping sdd eq 12 12 ln s d d a landsa t blue landsa t red b landsa t blue c furthermore several works found strong correlation between chl a and sdd al shehhi et al 2019 allee and johnson 1999 brezonik 1978 carlson 1977 dekker and peters 1993 doña et al 2015 doña et al 2014 gikas et al 2009 gikas et al 2006 stadelmann et al 2001 different satellite datasets used to measure sdd are enlisted in table 5 among all the datasets landsat tm due to its low cost and high spatial and temporal coverage is most frequently used in estimating sdd 3

carboxylic fulvic and humic acids derived from decomposition of plant material in soils and wetlands bacterial activity algal growth and sediment loading brezonik et al 2005 carder et al 1989 twardowski and donaghay 2001 these compounds impart yellow brown color to the water body when present in high concentrations branco and kremer 2005 gholizadeh et al 2016 an increase in cdom loading affects the physical chemical and biological properties of water bodies higher cdom levels cause attenuation to the penetration of light into water bodies and also support the growth of phytoplankton making water bodies more eutrophic stedmon et al 2011 therefore the presence of cdom influences the structure and functioning of the riverine ecosystem kutser et al 2005 cdom is found to be strongly correlated to other water quality parameters such as chl a tss and turbidity levels brezonik et al 2005 therefore visible spectral bands are found to be relevant in monitoring cdom concentration in water bodies further the presence of cdom is noticed to cause absorption in the ultraviolet range and blue green bands chen et al 2004 green and blough 1994 brezonik et al 2005 found that maximum energy absorbance occurs in 440 nm band due to the presence of cdom which coincides with the chl a absorption band carder et al 1989 therefore it becomes extremely difficult to segregate cdom levels from chl a concentration cdom level is usually obtained by determining the wavelength absorption coefficient using different datasets in this regard several analytical models have been developed hoge et al 1995 developed a two band radiance model inversion technique to demonstrate the cdom absorption coefficient using the coastal zone color scanner czcs spectral bands however the accuracy of the method depends on the presence of chlorophyll in the water body hirtle and rencz 2003 found a strong correlation between dissolved organic matter and landsat tm blue and green bands for the kejimkujik national park lake brezonik et al 2005 used the landsat tm data and identified that the presence of cdom decreases brightness in blue and green bands kutser et al 2005 used both landsat and ikonos datasets to determine the absorption coefficient in boreal lakes to monitor cdom levels the authors found that in comparison to 8 bit landsat data 11 bit ikonos data is more suitable for estimating the amount of cdom in boreal lakes due to higher digital resolution they further noticed that the ratio of 565 nm and 660 nm bands from the16 bit advanced land imager ali data is best in estimating cdom due to difficulty in retrieving cdom concentrations in the presence of suspended solids and chlorophyll content the use of hyperspectral remote sensing datasets is gaining importance in determining cdom levels menken et al 2006 identified that the ratio of 670 nm to 571 nm modis bands could best estimate cdom levels brando and dekker 2003 developed a matrix inversion technique to retrieve cdom concentrations using the eo 1 hyperion hyperspectral dataset which was noted to show sufficient sensitivity to detect concentrations of cdom chl a and tss in complex waters zhu et al 2011 proposed a method for inversion of hyperspectral remote sensing to determine the absorption coefficient for cdom inversion algorithms in general are found to be efficient in estimating cdom over a large spatio temporal scale karaska et al 2004 used the aviris dataset to monitor dissolved organic content along with other water quality parameters in the neuse river north carolina tehrani et al 2013 used three datasets seawifs modis and meris to estimate cdom concentrations and found that the ratio of 510 nm and 560 nm bands from meris dataset gives the most accurate results recently juhls et al 2019 used the meris dataset to determine the absorption coefficient of cdom in the arctic shelf region the proposed retrieval algorithm was found to perform well in extreme absorbing and high scattering waters with high optical complexity that cover the fluvial marine transition the other datasets that are used in cdom measurements are summarized in table 5 3 2 surface and sub surface water resources 3 2 1 streamflow estimation streamflow or discharge in the river is a dominant process of the hydrologic cycle by which water from the land surface is transported to the oceans river discharge is the volume of water flowing through the river cross section per unit of time and is expressed generally as cubic meter per second or cubic feet per second the measurement of river discharge provides information on water availability and is therefore necessary for water resource management and managing flood hazards mishra and coulibaly 2009 vörösmarty et al 2010 despite being a critical component for understanding surface water balance river discharges are understood poorly due to limited in situ networks shiklomanov et al 2002 mishra and coulibaly 2009 traditionally the in situ measurement of discharge involves the use of an already established stage discharge relationship or rating curve to estimate discharge corresponding to the stream stage or water level height recorded by stream gauges the in situ discharge measurement has several limitations such as stream gauges are located on a few large sized rivers and are not spatially distributed tang et al 2009 most of the globally significant rivers are sparsely gauged alsdorf et al 2003 further stream gauges are difficult to install in complex topography regions also there is a global decrease in the number of stream gauges due to a reduction in government funds for monitoring of stream gauges shiklomanov et al 2002 mishra and coulibaly 2009 the existence of a political situation or transboundary water sharing condition may further hinder the procurement of discharge data for several important rivers kim et al 2019 the measurement of water level by stream gauge is based on the assumption that runoff generated upstream of the catchment flows to a single downstream outlet this assumption might not hold in basins which are dominated by wetlands and floodplains where water from upstream reaches is diffused and then reach the channel alsdorf and lettenmaier 2003 also braided rivers characterized by several intertwined channels which keeps on changing the shapes pose an additional challenge for discharge measurement alsdorf and lettenmaier 2003 satellite remote sensing can circumvent these issues while estimating discharge and water storage alsdorf et al 2003 alsdorf and lettenmaier 2003 remote sensing datasets have the potential of providing frequent global coverage of discharge estimates which may offer an opportunity to improve the global streamflow network however streamflow discharge cannot be measured directly by satellite sensors therefore other hydraulic variables such as water level height velocity river cross section area river width and surface water slope among others are also measured by sensors the accuracy of discharge measurement depends on the efficiency with which the aforementioned hydraulic variables are estimated by remotely sensed data kim et al 2019 we find from the literature that a substantial amount of work is carried out using the altimeter datasets further there is a progression in the way altimeter datasets are used to estimate discharge therefore to keep the review concise we focus on scientific developments in streamflow estimation using the altimetric data radar altimeters are demonstrated to be useful in estimating water level variations in inaccessible areas leon et al 2006 the use of altimetry came into limelight with 1969 nasa s skylab s 193 radar altimeter experiment brown 1977 altimeters measure the time taken by the nadir directed radar pulse to cover a round trip from satellite to water surface and use it to determine the distance from satellite to water surface the water level is determined by computing differences in the satellite s position with respect to the reference ellipsoid and distance from the satellite to the water surface tang et al 2009 the general equation to measure the height of the water surface from the satellite is given by eq 13 13 h h r c o r r where h is the water surface height h is the height of satellite orbit r is the altimeter range measurement and corr represents the various corrections pertaining to tropospheric correction tc both dry and wet ionospheric correction ic and tidal correction t that need to be applied eq 14 14 corr t c i c t radar altimetry was initially intended to monitor sea surface height variations due to its large footprint with the launch of geosat 1985 1990 topex poseidon 1992 2005 ers 1 1991 2000 ers 2 1995 2011 geosat follow on gfo 1998 2008 jason 1 2001 2013 jason 2 2008 2016 environmental satellite envisat 2002 2012 jason 3 2016 present sentinel 3 2016 present and saral altika 2013 present satellites usage of altimeter was extended to inland waters berry et al 2005 birkett 1995a together available global altimetry datasets provide approximately three decade long information on water levels of large lakes and global rivers this information finds applications in the areas of predictions in ungauged basins climate change detection monitoring river water availability and executing hydrologic models 3 2 1 1 using altimeters some of the pioneering works by birkett 1994 and mason et al 1994 involve the use of radar altimetry for mapping changes in lake levels mason et al 1994 used esa s ers 1 radar altimeter along with an infra red radiometer atsr to monitor volumes of lakes morris and gill 1994 successfully demonstrated the use of geosat altimetry data to monitor variations in the water level of five great lakes of the united states and lake st clair birkett 1995a assessed the potential of topex poseidon t p to map global lake levels apart from great lakes altimeter data is often used to measure water levels in large global rivers in one of the initial works koblinsky et al 1993 demonstrated the ability of geosat altimeter data to estimate the amazon river level or stage at four locations they concluded that the geosat altimeter based water level estimates are prone to errors which may be overcome by other missions such as ers 1 and t p birkett 1995b monitored the caspian sea the sudd wetlands and the amazon river using the t p dataset and noticed that seasonal and annual trends could be observed however the accuracy of the estimates was unknown which make the results unreliable from geosat to ers 1 and t p there is a reduction in the satellite orbital errors making radar altimetry a routine method to monitor inland water surfaces smith 1997 birkett 1998 identified that the t p data could successfully monitor rivers with a width greater than 1 km birkett 2000 used the t p data in conjugation with near infrared imagery from the avhrr dataset to obtain levels of rivers merging with lake chad and also determine permanent and seasonal lake levels coe and birkett 2004 extended this work to obtain mean monthly discharge estimates downstream of lake chad leon et al 2006 used t p and envisat datasets to determine stage discharge relationships between satellite derived water level and river discharge at 21 virtual stations in the upper negro basin a sub basin of amazon river basin from its source at columbia and venezuela borders to manaus in brazil birkett et al 2002 evaluated the t p data for all the major rivers and tributaries in the amazon river basin they successfully demonstrated that the altimeter data could be used to obtain water level information at 10 days interval for rivers with a width of 1 km the authors further suggested that the inclusion of grace and jers 1 datasets to the existing t p dataset may provide more accurate variability in water levels da silva et al 2010 compared the performance of ers 2 and envisat for estimating water levels in the amazon basin and found the latter to perform better sulistioadi et al 2015 demonstrated the use of envisat for small 4 200 m width and medium 200 800 m width rivers tarpanelli et al 2014 combined velocity information from the modis dataset with water level data obtained from the envisat altimeter to estimate discharge for the po river italy they found that the coupled dataset compares reasonably well with the in situ data cryosat 2 satellite was launched with the prime objective of monitoring the cryosphere however it has been used to map inland waters and is shown to have the potential to supplement the observations from envisat and jason 1 dibarboure et al 2012 villadsen et al 2015 evaluated the performance of cryosat 2 to monitor river levels in ganges and brahmaputra river basins the authors found that despite a large revisit time of 369 days the dataset could represent peak flows during summer due to monsoon and melting of snow in the himalayas schneider et al 2018 found accurate estimates with an average error of 0 38 m for water level observations from the cryosat 2 data for the po river italy against the in situ data jason 2 mission also known as the ocean surface topography mission ostm was launched as a continuation to the t p mission to measure the surface topography of oceans and continental surface waters lambin et al 2010 jason 2 was found to perform better than jason 1 and t p missions while monitoring lakes and reservoir systems birkett and beckley 2010 kuo and kao 2011 processed the jason 2 altimeter data using waveform retracking and water detection algorithms to estimate the surface height of the bajhang river in taiwan having seasonal width ranging from 100 m to 1 km through this work the use of altimeter data for monitoring small rivers with varying widths was successfully demonstrated jason 2 data was used successfully to estimate instantaneous discharge papa et al 2012 simulate flood events jarihani et al 2013 and also for flood forecasting chang et al 2019 hossain et al 2014 purposes further the use of jason 2 and jason 3 altimeter datasets along with ancillary data of river width and the course are reported to improve river water level estimates biswas et al 2019 combined the landsat and sar information with jason 3 altimeter and applied an extent based approach in two methods i river mask based k means clustering and ii k means clustering embedded with river mask to improve the satellite altimeter derived river heights saral altika mission is the only altimeter that works with a high frequency microwave band of ka 36 5 ghz which results in an effective footprint of 1 3 km saral is designated to fill the gap between the envisat and sentinel 3 missions kumar et al 2017 since it operates on a high frequency the signal was initially expected to suffer from higher attenuation however this shortcoming was utilized to detect heavy rainfall and flood wave conditions roy et al 2015 further the potential of the saral altimeter to monitor inland waters kumar et al 2015 which include braided rivers was successfully demonstrated dubey et al 2015 furthermore gupta et al 2015 converted water levels retrieved from the saral altika into discharge for the tapi river in india and used it to set up the hec ras hydraulic model for flood inundation modeling for further applications related to the saral altika mission readers may refer to kumar et al 2017 the sentinel 3 is a recently launched satellite mission under the european commission s copernicus program the mission comprises of four satellites amongst which the two satellites satellites a and b were launched in 2016 and 2018 respectively the sentinel 3 satellites are equipped with dual frequency sar altimeter sral which is similar to the cryosat altimeter with advancements although the primary purpose of the sentinel 3 mission is to measure sea surface topography and thickness of sea ice data can also be used to measure the height of rivers and lakes further details on the sentinel 3 mission can be obtained from donlon et al 2012 the initial observations from the sentinel 3 mission are found to be encouraging for water level and discharge monitoring bogning et al 2018 tarpanelli et al 2019 demonstrated the potential of sentinel 3 satellite with three on board sensors to estimate river discharge the direct use of altimeter data for water level and consequently river discharge is affected by low temporal resolution varying from 10 to 35 days and a large footprint of the data therefore several works in recent years have combined the radar altimeter data with in situ measurements in a data assimilation framework through data assimilation different satellite products can be merged with the hydrologic hydraulic model to estimate river discharge while taking into account both data and model errors mclaughlin 1995 neal et al 2009 showed that discharge estimates in ungauged basins could be improved by assimilating combined envisat sar and lidar derived dtm datasets into a coupled hydrologic and hydrodynamic model michailovsky et al 2013 assimilated the envisat data into a river routing model to obtain discharge along the main channel of the brahmaputra river similar assimilation studies were carried out by emery et al 2017 and paiva et al 2013 3 2 1 2 using empirical equations and rating curve apart from water levels heights discharge can also be estimated using other hydraulic variables such as water surface area channel slope average channel width and velocity of rivers this information can be obtained from existing remote sensing datasets and used as an input in general hydraulic equations bjerklie et al 2003 for further details readers may refer to bjerklie et al 2003 there have been several works wherein the river stage and consequently discharge is indirectly estimated by correlating inundated area with ground measurements of stage or discharge smith et al 1995 used the ers 1 dataset to develop an area discharge rating curve for a braided glacial river in british columbia canada smith et al 1996 further extended this work to estimate discharge in ungauged braided rivers although individual remote sensing datasets have been used to obtain information of flood inundation and discharge frappart et al 2005 used the combined information from sar jers 1 and t p datasets to estimate both flood extent and water levels in the negro river of the amazon basin to determine the water volume stored in the floodplains however they observed that depending on the way floods inundate the area geographically there can be very low to no difference in the flood plain and river level making the measurements erroneous therefore to overcome this problem a combination of several radar altimeters may be useful frappart et al 2006 extended this work and used altimetry data from ers 2 envisat and t p satellites to develop water level time series for the lower mekong river basin and observed strong seasonality signals in various rivers in the catchment furthermore xu et al 2004 used the quickbird 2 satellite data at a high spatial resolution of 0 61 m to estimate water surface width and developed relationships between water surface width and river width stage and stage discharge rating curves the rating curves were used to estimate discharge in the yangtze river china similar work was carried out by zhang et al 2004 to determine river discharge in a non trapezoidal open channel smith and pavelsky 2008 used the modis data to determine channel geometry parameters to understand discharge and flow conveyance in inaccessible river systems birkinshaw et al 2014 used the altimeter data from ers 2 and envisat to estimate river stage information they combined the altimeter data with channel slope information and river channel width obtained from the landsat to estimate discharge in the ungauged locations of mekong and ob rivers sichangi et al 2016 combined altimetry data from several altimeter missions to improve the temporal resolution of the water level data they further used this combined data with the modis data and dem to obtain discharge estimates based on stage and both stage and width the authors found that using both stage and width can significantly improve river discharge estimates 3 2 1 3 surface water ocean topography swot mission the success of altimeter data in mapping discharge is noted to depend on first the accuracy of water level change estimates second frequency of obtaining water level estimates and third conversion of water level data to discharge estimates koblinsky et al 1993 besides most of the studies reported earlier are for individual river reaches and also depend on in situ data based on which relationship between different variables is developed therefore there is still a need for global monitoring of rivers several of the limitations associated with the existing radar altimetry are expected to be resolved by the planned surface water ocean topography swot mission alsdorf and lettenmaier 2003 the swot mission is designed to provide consistent and coherent information about river discharge and storage which will improve the understanding of inaccessible and ungauged rivers biancamaria et al 2016 the mission aims at measuring water surface elevation top width and free surface slope enabling discharge estimation for rivers with a width greater than 50 m durand et al 2016 assimilating this information into the hydrodynamic models will allow extraction of information such as bathymetry which is not directly observable and may further assist in the estimation of river discharge andreadis et al 2007 pavelsky et al 2014 explored the potential of swot mission to monitor global rivers and noted that the mission would significantly improve our hydrological database by updating the global runoff data centre grdc observation network several initial exploratory studies based on synthetic data have been conducted which suggest that the swot measurements could allow accurate estimates of river discharge for many rivers without in situ calibration andreadis et al 2007 assimilated water surface elevation information from the synthetic swot experiment to estimate river flow depth and discharge durand et al 2008 estimated bathymetric depth and slope from water surface elevation measurements obtained from the synthetic swot experiments and assimilated into the lisflood fp model to estimate discharge further uncertainty from river channel bathymetry which is the main source of error in discharge estimates is also quantified biancamaria et al 2011 assimilated the synthetic swot observations corresponding to the ob river to estimate changes in water depths assuming river bathymetry and quantified the errors due to uncertainties in atmospheric forcing fields and swot orbits they found that the assimilation scheme at a nominal orbit of the mission has the least error in estimating river water depth most of the studies above assumed river bathymetry and neglected the associated errors yoon et al 2012 assimilated water surface elevation information into the lisflood fp model to demonstrate river bathymetry estimation for obtaining river discharge from the swot mission for the ohio river basin through the assimilation process discharge and bathymetry errors were accurately modeled and it is noticed that errors in bathymetry measurement can have a significant influence on river discharge estimates similar attempts are made over the recent years that assimilate synthetic swot observation into hydrodynamic models to improve discharge estimates andreadis and schumann 2014 pedinotti et al 2014 munier et al 2015 domeneghetti et al 2018 apart from data assimilation techniques there are significant works that focused on the development of algorithms to estimate discharge using various hydraulic variables from the swot mission bjerklie 2007 developed an algorithm based on manning s equation that uses variables such as channel width channel slope and meander length to estimate velocity and discharge of rivers gleason and smith 2014 developed at many stations hydraulic geometry amhg algorithm to reduce the number of parameters required to estimate river discharge using multiple satellite images durand et al 2014 developed an algorithm based on the diffusive approximation of shallow water equations to estimate river bathymetry roughness coefficient and discharge using surface elevation and slope information garambois and monnier 2015 proposed inverse models based on the saint venant equations to invert effective low flow bathymetry and roughness coefficient to estimate discharge durand et al 2016 presented an intercomparison of five discharge algorithms for 19 rivers with varying hydraulic and geomorphological conditions and suggested that incorporating ancillary data corresponding to elevation and bathymetry and a combination of algorithms may improve discharge estimates although the initial results are encouraging there is still scope for improvement in the algorithms to obtain accurate discharge estimates 3 2 2 terrestrial water storage the terrestrial water storage tws accounts for all the water available above and below the surface of the earth and forms an important component of the hydrologic cycle however it is difficult to measure tws at a regional or global scale lettenmaier and famiglietti 2006 in this regard the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellite mission launched in march 2002 proves to be advantageous the grace mission was primarily aimed at mapping temporal variability in earth s gravitation field at 400 to 40 000 km spatial resolution and 30 days interval tapley et al 2004b grace has shown promising results in inferring trends in surface water mass anomalies crowley et al 2006 schmidt et al 2006 tapley et al 2004a wahr et al 2004 changes in the tws δ t w s are estimated from the grace data using eq 15 and 16 frappart and ramillien 2018 kuss et al 2012 15 δ t w s δ s w s δ s m s δ s p s δ g w s wherein 16 δ t w s t w s grace t 2 t w s grace t 1 tw s grace t 1 and tw s grace t 2 indicate the total water storage obtained from the grace data at time 1 and time 2 respectively difference between tw s grace t 2 and tw s grace t 1 gives the tws anomaly as shown in eq 16 δ s w s is the surface water storage anomaly δ s m s is soil moisture storage anomaly δ s p s is snowpack storage anomaly and δ g w s is groundwater storage anomaly to determine δ g w s the eq 15 can be rewritten as eq 17 17 δ g w s δ t w s δ s w s δ s m s δ s p s wherein δ t w s can be obtained from the grace data eq 16 and the remaining variables can be obtained from other remote sensing sources or hydrologic model outputs initial works demonstrated the use of grace data in monitoring groundwater storage changes rodell and famiglietti 2002 rodell et al 2007 rodell et al 2009 crowley et al 2006 showed the capability of grace data in estimating tws for the congo basin during 2002 2006 syed et al 2008 carried out a detailed analysis to show the use of grace data in understanding spatio temporal variability in tws changes at the continental scale the grace data is also found to be useful in monitoring groundwater changes in groundwater dependent irrigated areas famiglietti et al 2011 rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 and groundwater depletion feng et al 2013 apart from direct tws measurements the grace data is also assimilated into land surface models to improve simulations of hydrologic fluxes and water storage eicker et al 2014 khaki et al 2018a khaki et al 2018b li et al 2019 li et al 2012 tian et al 2017 zaitchik et al 2008 grace data is also used in combination with other datasets to estimate floodplain storage alsdorf et al 2010 reager and famiglietti 2009 segregating tws into surface water storage and land water storage forootan et al 2014 terrestrial freshwater discharge li et al 2016 syed et al 2009 syed et al 2010 and soil moisture and shallow groundwater estimation girotto et al 2019 since the grace data is available at coarse resolution it is incompatible with other hydrological datasets landerer and swenson 2012 showed the accuracy of various scaling techniques to estimate tws observations at 1 1 resolution this enables the use of grace data for closing the water balance at a regional scale other studies related to the applications of the grace data in determining water storage changes include cao et al 2019a b c gonçalves et al 2019 jing et al 2020 meng et al 2019 van dijk et al 2011 voss et al 2013 and wang et al 2011 the grace mission ended in 2017 and is continued through grace follow on grace fo mission which was launched in may 2018 the grace fo carries a laser interferometry system to improve ranging precision between the two satellites sheard et al 2012 the advancements in the grace fo mission are likely to provide improvement in surface mass anomalies pertaining to terrestrial water storage and ice sheets and adding further insights to the hydrological studies frappart and ramillien 2018 3 2 3 monitoring of reservoirs reservoirs play an important role in ensuring water security of a region particularly during extreme drought events mishra and singh 2010 reservoir monitoring is critical for the river basin management system as they regulate inter seasonal and inter annual fluctuations in streamflow gao et al 2012 reservoirs also help in flood control hydroelectric power generation facilitating continuous water supply and other recreational activities despite their manifold importance observations on water storage in reservoirs are either lacking or difficult to access with the advent of radar altimetry it has become possible to monitor the large reservoirs remotely to estimate water storage in reservoirs both surface water area and bathymetry measurements are required with this intent the data from multiple altimeters along with the modis data were used to create a time series of 34 global reservoir storages gao et al 2012 geoscience laser altimeter system glas of the ice cloud and land elevation satellite icesat was used to extract storage information for 21 reservoirs in south asia zhang et al 2014 the saral dataset was used to monitor the maithon reservoir in jharkhand india ghosh et al 2015 bonnema and hossain 2019 evaluated the ability of the swot mission to model changes in reservoir storage in the mekong river basin for lake and reservoir monitoring okeowo et al 2017 developed an algorithm to directly extract water level information from the jason 2 and envisat radar altimeters to develop reservoir time series this development may assist a large hydrologic community which may have little knowledge in this field in addition to directly using the altimeter data the potential of assimilating altimeter data corresponding to reservoirs from different altimeter datasets for accurate river basin modeling is also explored cardenal et al 2011 michailovsky and bauer gottwein 2014 3 3 extreme events 3 3 1 floods floods are one of the worst natural disasters that have the greatest impact on life food and water security globally floods incurred economic losses up to usd 56 billion in 2016 wing et al 2018 in march 2019 alone global costs due to flooding are estimated to be around usd 8 billion podlaha et al 2019 some of the consequences of floods include anoutbreak of waterborne diseases kondo et al 2002 crop damage rosenzweig et al 2002 and drinking water contamination sirajul islam et al 2007 among others these factors affect the sustainability of water resources so there is a need to develop strategies to monitor and manage floods in a basin some of the necessary steps include a determining the vulnerable regions that get frequently affected due to floods in a region and subsequently establish appropriate legislation in terms of land use planning and management b development of control and diversion structures that take shocks in the case of flash floods and extreme precipitation events and c development of independent infrastructure to drain floodwaters in urban landscapes these steps require continuous monitoring of water level flood volume and flood extent which are the three factors that determine the severity of floodin a basin it is important to note that in situ gauge sensors are expensive to monitor and are susceptible to damage during heavy flood events which hinders the data acquisition process under these circumstances there is a need to rely on satellite remote sensing information to monitor floods over the past two decades there is an increased awareness among space agencies to utilize remote sensing information to monitor floods typically optical passive and active microwave sensors are used to monitor floods in this section we review the role of satellite remote sensing for monitoring the flood extent we review the remote sensing applications in streamflow detection which includes water depth detection in section 4 2 1 3 3 1 1 flood extent using optical sensors in the visible and thermal electromagnetic radiation spectrum water has a relatively low reflectivity compared to other land cover types this is the principle based on which flood monitoring is carried out using optical sensors details regarding some of the operational optical satellite sensors including avhrr viirs modis sentinel landsat spot aster ikonos quickbird worldview rapideye ziyuan 3 zy 3 and gaofen missions among others used for this purpose can be found in table 1 typically optical remote sensing signals include blue 0 45 0 52 μm for landsat 4 5 7 and 8 missions 0 45 0 48 μm for modis green 0 50 0 57 μm red 0 61 0 70 μm near infrared nir 0 7 0 9 μm and mid infrared mir 1 5 3 μm bands several indices have been proposed in the past that evolved from using reflectance information from using band ratios to using a combination of multiple indices ma et al 2019 these indices are useful in assessing the flood extent by classifying the areas of dry and inundated regions tasseled cap wetness tcw index crist 1985 crist and cicone 1984 is the earliest water index which is derived as a combination of six bands of reflectance information sourced from landsat a threshold of 0 is set to identify water bodies normalized difference water index ndwi proposed by mcfeeters 1996 is one of the widely used water indices it is expressed as a ratio of ρ green ρ nir and ρ green ρ nir where ρ is surface reflectance however ndwi cannot separate the presence of water in built up areas due to similar reflective characteristics of these two features in green and nir bands zhou et al 2017 xu 2006 addressed this issue by replacing nir with swir resulting in the ratio between ρ green ρ swir and ρ green ρ swir however this method cannot delineate water bodies in snow cover regions huang et al 2018 table 6 presents a summary of the water extraction indices proposed in the literature further information on the use of optical sensors in flood detection can be obtained from huang et al 2018 ma et al 2019 and zhou et al 2017 in the thermal spectrum few studies have utilized the diurnal land surface temperature difference as an indicator to detect flood inundation ordoyne and friedl 2008 parinussa et al 2016 despite their ease of applicability information from optical sensors is affected by the atmosphere in the form of clouds and particulate matter and vegetation besides image acquisition can be carried out only during the daytime in case of the presence of clouds or vegetation the reflectance from these features can be so prominent that the image may not be useful to monitor floods in real time it is therefore necessary to use information from microwave sensors for the flood monitoring process 3 3 1 2 flood extent using active microwave sensors active microwave sensors emit their signals of electromagnetic radiations in microwave frequencies towards the earth surface and measure the scattered signal in the form of backscatter coefficient which contains information about the surface s texture shape and its dielectric properties woodhouse 2017 active microwave radar sensors can penetrate through clouds with less attenuation sanyal and lu 2004 and also provide information independent of solar illumination moreira et al 2013 their ability to acquire information in the order of ten to hundreds of meters provides an opportunity to monitor floods on rivers with a width of less than 1 km mason et al 2011 schumann et al 2009 some of the operational synthetic aperture radar sar microwave satellite missions include alos 2 saocom 1a radarsat 2 risat 1 cosmo skymed and terrasar x among others details regarding these sensors can be found in table 1 the spatial and temporal resolutions of sar imagery are critical factors for flood monitoring there is an inherent tradeoff between these two resolutions generally the spatial and temporal resolutions of sar imagery will be in the order of 1 100 m and 11 46 days respectively di baldassarre et al 2011 schumann et al 2009 to counteract the issue of low temporal resolution space agencies are launching constellations of satellites which work together for example the sentinel 1 mission is a constellation of two satellites which combinedly reduce the global revisit time to 6 days geudtner et al 2014 torres et al 2012 the revisit time is reduced further to 5 days with the follow up mission of sentinel 2 drusch et al 2012 which is launched in 2016 besides the cosmo skymed mission is also a constellation of four satellites which can provide high resolution sar imagery with a revisit time as low as 2 h covello et al 2010 the reduced revisit time will aid in flood monitoring as was implemented successfully in the past the backscatter coefficient recorded in a sar imagery is influenced by the characteristics of target and sensor such as a surface roughness and b dielectric properties of target affect the backscatter coefficient c frequency of radiation d polarization e incidence angle f properties of atmosphere and g meteorological conditions such as rainfall wind speed etc the frequency of radiation has an inverse effect on the depth of penetration of the backscatter signal ulaby et al 1982 generally backscatter coefficients from l 0 5 1 5 ghz c 4 8 ghz and x 8 12 ghz bands frequencies are found to be useful for flood monitoring studies with l band having a greater ability to penetrate through vegetation and relatively lesser influence due to roughness grimaldi et al 2016 schumann et al 2012 the sensitivity of the backscatter coefficient to surface roughness increases with increasing angles and vice versa ulaby et al 1982 water bodies generally appear darker with low backscatter signal unless affected by water surface roughness or wind stress bragg scatter costa et al 2006 freeman and durden 1998 before analyzing the sar data it is important to pre process the imageries in terms of geo referencing process of locating the image on the earth ortho rectification process of correcting the systematic sensor and platform induced geometry errors and speckle removal process of filtering the noise that persists in the backscatter signal grimaldi et al 2016 several approaches have been developed in the past that map the flood extent using the sar imageries these methods can be called as image classification techniques since the prime objective is to differentiate the locations that are dry and wet inundated these methods can be broadly classified into a visual interpretation b image thresholding c automatic image classification algorithms d active contour models and e change detection techniques it has to be noted that each of these techniques has its advantages and disadvantages and there is no optimal technique that applies to all case studies di baldassarre et al 2011 grimaldi et al 2016 schumann et al 2009 the visual interpretation involves the examination of flood lines from imageries although this method is a straightforward way to map the flood extent the outcome can be erroneous due to the influence of factors such as flooded regions appearing to be brighter due to roughness and wind effects some of the studies that implemented this technique include brivio et al 2002 giustarini et al 2016 macintosh and profeti 1995 oberstadler et al 1997 image thresholding is an efficient and simplest approach for image classification landuyt et al 2018 in these techniques a radiometric threshold value is determined to differentiate two classes flood non flood areas that have significantly different pixel distributions image thresholding techniques can be broadly classified as follows sezgin and sankur 2004 1 histogram shape based methods analyze the peaks and valleys among other properties of the smoothened histogram of image guo and pandit 1998 martinis et al 2009 ramesh et al 1995 rosenfeld and de la torre 1983 sezan 1990 2 clustering based methods which separate the image into two clusters that correspond to water and non water pixels chang et al 2010 cho et al 1989 jawahar et al 1997 otsu 1979 ridler and calvard 1978 schumann et al 2010 3 entropy based methods determine the entropy of the two clusters and the cross entropy between the original and binarized images cheng et al 1999 kapur et al 1985 rajinikanth et al 2018 sahoo et al 1997 sarkar et al 2016 4 object attribute based methods which assess the similarity between original and binarized images dasgupta et al 2018 hertz and schafer 1988 martinis et al 2009 pikaz and averbuch 1996 pulvirenti et al 2011 5 spatial methods which use probability distributions between the pixels brivio et al 2002 cao et al a b c the threshold value obtained from the above described techniques is dependent on satellite sensors land surface and environmental conditions so these techniques have to be applied on a scene by scene basis consequently these techniques turn out to be time consuming and are also prone to errors due to the subjectivity of the image in focus automatic thresholding techniques try to alleviate this problem by determining automatically the threshold gray value that separates the flood and non flood values these techniques vary according to the estimation of the threshold at a global scale single threshold for the whole image pal and pal 1993 or local scale threshold according to local conditions sahoo et al 1988 they also differ based on the involvement of parameters in the models leading to parametric and nonparametric models some of the automated methods were proposed by chini et al 2017 giustarini et al 2012 martinis et al 2015 martinis et al 2009 matgen et al 2011 and wan et al 2019 for instance martinis et al 2015 s technique involves the division of sar image into non overlapping tiles and an iterative procedure is adopted to select representative tiles that have a histogram with strong bimodality this technique is implemented as an on demand terrasar x based flood determination service which is extended to sentinel 1c band data twele et al 2016 active contour models acm also called as snakes are one of the widely used automatic techniques for flood extent delineation caselles et al 1993 chan and vese 2001 cohen 1991 horritt 1999 horritt et al 2001 kass et al 1988 acms involve a dynamic curvilinear contour which evolves subject to image constraints to determine objects of the image contours are a set of nodes connected with straight lines the objects in the context of floods can be land and flood inundated areas the contour is driven by an energy function which attracts the contour towards the edges of the object this energy function considers the changes in backscatter coefficients inside the region the changes in backscatter coefficients outside the region and an edge length parameter debusscher and van coillie 2019 this search process continues until the flooded area is identified several studies implemented acms for the detection of flood inundation bates et al 1997 bates et al 2006 de roo et al 1999 debusscher and van coillie 2019 horritt 1999 horritt et al 2001 landuyt et al 2018 schumann et al 2012 the methods described above deal single image change detection methods on the other hand use two images non flooding and post flooding of the same region of interest through these two images the difference in the backscatter coefficients can be obtained which can be used further for delineating the inundated areas the difference in the two images is calculated generally as a ratio moser and serpico 2006 or log ratio bazi et al 2005 chini et al 2017 to counteract the multiplicative nature of speckle in the sar data hostache et al 2012 noticed that the selection of reference non flooding images could significantly affect the output from change detection techniques this is due to the high variability of backscatter coefficients as a result of atmospheric components land surface processes such as soil moisture evapotranspiration seasonality in the vegetation characteristics land use changes and the image acquisition characteristics in this context moya et al 2019 identified that change detection could cause false detection of floods in agricultural areas and attempted to address this issue by proposing a new parameter that is helpful to determine if the detected change is attributed to either flooded or non flooded area in the agricultural region recently landuyt et al 2018 compared a couple of thresholding techniques acm and change detection using sar images of several flood events that occurred in the uk and ireland they indicate that acms can produce flood maps at greater accuracy at the expense of computational resources whereas martinis et al 2015 s automated thresholding technique is suitable for near real time flood detection and monitoring efforts are made to include multiple techniques in order to obtain much accurate flood maps for example matgen et al 2011 proposed an automated sar flood monitoring system wherein they used both thresholding and change detection techniques long et al 2014 proposed change detection and thresholding cdat method for flood extent delineation in caprivi region of namibia 3 3 1 3 flood extent using passive microwave sensors passive microwave radiometers capture the naturally emitted electromagnetic radiations from the earth s surface in the form of brightness temperatures due to the differences in the thermal inertia and the emissivity of land and water the brightness temperatures recorded by the satellite are colder over the water surface this contrast in brightness temperatures is generally utilized for detecting flood inundated regions choudhury 1989 hamilton et al 1996 schmugge 1987 smith 1997 in this context brakenridge et al 2007 developed a technique that uses horizontal polarization ka band 37 ghz frequency information in this work the ratio between the brightness temperature of the target grid cell and a background calibration reference dry grid cell is computed which corresponds to the variations in the discharge and the water extent in the grid cell besides basist et al 1998 proposed a method to determine water extent using the notion of a decrease in emissivity with increase in the fraction of water surface in a pixel they related this emissivity with the difference in brightness temperature across multiple frequencies in this process they derived an index called basin water index bwi which is demonstrated using vertically polarized ssm i 19 37 and 85 ghz frequencies it is important to note that the brightness temperature measurements are only available in the order of tens of kilometers due to the low energy of microwave emissions so it will be possible to assess the flood extent only in the case of large catchments of areas greater than 1000 km2 grimaldi et al 2016 also the microwave signals have noticeable attenuation due to the atmosphere beyond x band frequency prigent et al 2016 karthikeyan et al 2017 so these attenuations should also be accounted for during the retrieval process nevertheless several global flood monitoring systems utilize information from passive microwave sensors for instance global flood detection system version 2 kugler and de groeve 2007 coordinated by global disaster alert and coordination system gdacs in collaboration with dartmouth flood observatory produces flood information using amsr2 and global precipitation mission gpm sensors https www gdacs org flooddetection overview aspx there are certain merits and demerits associated with each of these optical active and passive microwave products recognizing the need to combine the strengths of each of these sensors to obtain flood information with improved accuracy efforts have been to develop multi satellite global flood monitoring systems prigent et al 2001 developed global inundation extent from multi satellites giems prigent et al 2016 which combines information from ssm i passive microwave sensor ers european remote sensing satellite active microwave sensor and avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer optical sensor to provide monthly global inundation maps at 25 km resolution over the period 1993 2007 furthermore schroeder et al 2015 developed surface water microwave product series swamps by combining information from passive sensors ssm i ssmis special sensor microwave imager sounder active sensors ers quikscat and ascat advanced scatterometer an optical sensor modis swamps produced global scale surface water fraction maps at 25 km covering the period 1992 2013 recently parrens et al 2019 developed a 1 km inundation product at three days temporal resolution over the amazon basin using information from soil moisture ocean salinity smos landsat and shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem over the period 2010 2016 3 3 2 droughts the demand for water has increased significantly due to the growth of population and expansion of agricultural energy and industrial sectors which resulted in frequent water scarcityin many parts of the world mishra and singh 2010 the water scarcity is aggravated by droughts that impact surface and groundwater resources leading to reduced water supply deteriorated water quality risk of wildfires taufik et al 2017 livestock murray tortarolo and jaramillo 2019 food production cottrell et al 2019 water stress pedro monzonís et al 2015 shah and mathur 2019 among others therefore drought management related investigation e g monitoring forecasting and risk assessment is essential for the planning and management of water resources droughts are triggered by the anomalous behavior in hydroclimatic variables such as reduction in precipitation increase in temperatures low relative humidity and distribution of rainy days mishra and singh 2010 with the advent of satellite remote sensing it is now possible to track the anomalous behavior of such variables at different spatio temporal scales droughts are classified broadly into meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic droughts mishra and singh 2010 although there is no standard definition of drought mukherjee et al 2018 it generally originates due to the deficit of water compared to normal conditions van loon et al 2016 since droughts are associated with the movement of water in the hydrological cycle the droughts mentioned above are intricately related to each other in this context several drought indices have been proposed in the past that assess the individual as well as the multivariate nature of droughts rajsekhar et al 2015 the following sections present the applications of remote sensing towards assessing meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts 3 3 2 1 meteorological drought meteorological drought is associated with the lack of occurrence of precipitation over a duration mishra and singh 2010 traditionally the meteorological drought analysis is carried out using in situ precipitation information zuo et al 2019 palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 is used as a meteorological drought index and it measures the departure of the moisture supply based on the supply and demand concept of the water balance equation the pdsi is calculated by accounting precipitation and temperature data as well as the local available water content of the soil several limitations of pdsi palmer 1965 mishra and singh 2010 are addressed through self calibrating pdsi spdsi wells et al 2004 there are limited studies that incorporated remote sensing information to derive pdsi for example yan et al 2014 incorporated remotely sensed global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms leaf area index lai based et in to spdsi to carry out drought assessment at the global scale standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 is another meteorological drought index which is calculated using long term precipitation data at a given location spi involves fitting precipitation to an appropriate probability distribution and then transforming it to a normal distribution since the spi requires only precipitation data it is one of the widely used meteorological drought indices however there is a need for at least 30 years of precipitation data to obtain a reliable statistical fit while estimating the spi with the advent of long term remote sensing based products such as chirps climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station funk et al 2015 and mswep multi source weighted ensemble precipitation beck et al 2019 it is now possible to determine spi using this information for instance bayissa et al 2017 used chirps data to monitor meteorological drought in ethiopia shrestha et al 2017 assessed the accuracy of the spi estimates of chirps over the koshi basin nepal and observed that spi values identified historical droughts recently golian et al 2019 compared the spi of chirps and mswep along with reanalysis and gauge based precipitation datasets at global scale they found that the drought indices are sensitive to the choice of precipitation dataset its length and spatial resolution in addition some more drought indices are proposed that utilize remote sensing data anderson et al 2011 and anderson et al 2007 developed remote sensing based evaporative stress index esi which represents the temporal anomalies in the ratio between actual evapotranspiration aet and potential evapotranspiration pet the esi is computed using tir and vegetation cover fraction imagery of geostationary operational environmental satellites goes kim and rhee 2016 proposed standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi a fully et based index that is derived using the complementary relationship between evaporative demand and aet vicente serrano et al 2018 used gleam aet estimates to carry out drought assessment using sedi at global scale since esi and sedi are independent of rainfall they can be used as a reference to evaluate the precipitation based meteorological drought indices recognizing the need to include evapotranspiration while characterizing meteorological drought vicente serrano et al 2010 proposed a new multiscalar drought index named the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei spei works similar to spi with the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet as the random variable of interest this difference essentially provides climatic water balance i e whether there exists a water surplus or water deficit in a particular month in a recent study zhao and ma 2019 considered trmm chirps and persiann cdr precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record ashouri et al 2015 hsu et al 1997 along with other precipitation products to estimate spei at the global scale they found persiann cdr to be relatively more suitable for long term drought monitoring purposes similar to spei reconnaissance drought index rdi tsakiris et al 2007 is a meteorological drought index computed as a ratio between accumulated rainfall and pet dalezios et al 2012 determined rdi for drought assessment using remotely sensed information based pet and station rainfall data in greece zhang and jia 2013 proposed microwave integrated drought index midi that considers trmm precipitation amsr e derived land surface temperature and soil moisture for monitoring short term meteorological drought zhang et al 2019a attempted to improve meteorological drought monitoring using multi satellite precipitation products with midi in tropical and subtropical water limited climates they found multi satellite midi estimates to correlate well with spi and spei 3 3 2 2 agricultural drought agricultural drought occurs due to a decline in soil moisture which subsequently leads to the failure of crops mishra and singh 2010 the lack of water in the soil can be attributed to a deficit in rainfall or lack of irrigation due to lack of water in the reservoirs along with a greater amount of evapotranspiration from the soil therefore agricultural drought monitoring is carried out primarily by analyzing the patterns of vegetation and soil moisture agricultural drought is also intricately related to the meteorological conditions several studies indicated the link between the agricultural drought and precipitation anomalies elagib 2013 kurnik et al 2011 rouault and richard 2003 svoboda et al 2012 so attempts are made to study agricultural drought in an integrated manner we find that there is a relatively greater number of agricultural drought indices compared to the meteorological drought indices proposed in the literature pdsi has an issue of reacting slowly to short term droughts which if overlooked can impact the monitoring of crop growth narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 crop moisture index cmi developed by palmer 1968 attempts to alleviate this problem it is calculated based on pet and soil moisture depletion with soil water balance as a governing concept on a similar idea relative soil moisture rsm thornthwaite and mather 1955 agricultural drought index dtx matera et al 2007 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 noted that cmi similar to pdsi has limitations of assuming uniform properties of land use and soil in a climatic zone they attempted to address this issue through new indices called the soil moisture deficit index smdi and evapotranspiration deficit index etdi by simulating soil moisture and et using soil water assessment tool swat attempts are made to analyze multiple types of droughts by using the water energy balance equation ayantobo and wei 2019 zhang et al 2019b similar to the computation of spi standardized soil moisture index ssi can be derived based on the soil moisture information mishra et al 2015 aghakouchak 2015 zhang et al 2019d computed weekly ssi using esa cci soil moisture product for agricultural drought monitoring of the yellow river basin china with the advent of remote sensing information several compatible agricultural drought indices are proposed hunt et al 2009 and sridhar et al 2008 proposed the soil moisture index smi which is calculated as a function of the ratio of the difference between soil moisture and wilting point and the difference between field capacity and wilting point recently martínez fernández et al 2015 modified the smi to propose soil water deficit index swdi wherein the soil moisture deficit is limited by field capacity instead of wilting point in the numerator given its advantage of being independent of the length of the record swdi can be applied even on shorter soil moisture time series mishra et al 2017 used smap soil moisture to generate swdi to monitor agricultural drought over the contiguous united states conus carrão et al 2016 proposed empirical standardized soil moisture index essmi using esa cci soil moisture data by estimating the standard normal variates of empirical distribution of soil moisture at various timescales in terms of characterizing the agricultural drought corresponding to vegetation the normalized vegetation difference index ndvi tucker 1979 is probably the most famous remote sensing based index it is calculated as the ratio of difference between reflectance of near infrared nir and red r bands and the sum of nir and r bands of an optical satellite airborne sensor ndvi indicates the condition of vegetation healthy or unhealthy and its presence however it is associated with certain limitations zargar et al 2011 this resulted in alternate vegetation indices such as enhanced vegetation index evi liu and huete 1995 soil adjusted vegetation index savi epiphanio and huete 1995 huete 1988 normalized difference water index ndwi gao 1996 and normalized multi band drought index nmdi wang and qu 2007 furthermore vegetation condition index vci kogan 1990 is a scaled version of ndvi computed as vc i t ndv i t n d v i min ndv i max n d v i min at time t that removes the effects of weather in ndvi and determines the health of vegetation it is used extensively for agricultural drought monitoring in the literature quiring and ganesh 2010 estimated vci using advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr to assess the possibility of using vci as a meteorological drought indicator in texas in a similar attempt zambrano et al 2016 carried out agricultural drought monitoring with vci using modis mod13q1 ndvi product over cropland areas in chile and compared the outcome with station based spi similar to vci temperature condition index tci is proposed to determine how vegetation reacts to temperature tci ls t max l s t ls t max l s t min kogan 1995 apart from the above indices some of the hybrid drought indices are also proposed in the literature that considers remote sensing information can input as an extension of vci and tci kogan 1995 introduced the vegetation health index vhi which is a linear combination of tci and vci mostly an equal weight is assigned to tci and vci while calculating vhi kogan 1997 recently bachmair et al 2018 compared modis based vci and vhi with spi and spei over europe under crop and forest land cover conditions brown et al 2008 developed an integrated drought index called the vegetation drought response index vegdri that uses climate satellite and biophysical variables in a statistical regression framework similarly rhee et al 2010 proposed scaled drought condition index sdci for monitoring agricultural droughts sdci is computed as a linear combination of scaled modis lst ndvi and trmm precipitation using a linear combination of ratios of et and pet and ndvi mu et al 2013 proposed drought severity index dsi which is based on modis products vyas et al 2015 proposed a combined deficit index cdi to characterize agricultural drought it is based linear combination of remotely sensed rainfall and ndvi datasets zuo et al 2019 used cdi to assess agricultural drought in northeast china liu et al 2017b used the relationship between satellite brightness temperature from amsr e and ndvi from modis to develop microwave temperature vegetation drought index mtvdi while determining an integrated agricultural drought response it is essential to note that vegetation exhibits lagged response to the meteorological drought due to the residual soil moisture content and the soil moisture memory anderson et al 2012 di et al 1994 therefore it is important to consider this lag for the accurate characterization of the agricultural drought in this context sánchez et al 2016 proposed soil moisture agricultural drought index smadi by integrating the soil moisture condition index smci formulation of which is similar to that of vci a modified version of tci and lagged vci smadi is found to capture the agricultural droughts when tested using smos soil moisture modis lst and ndvi at global scale sánchez et al 2018 the multivariate drought indices are recently derived from integrate different types of drought rajsekhar et al 2015 kao and govindaraju 2010 proposed the joint deficit index jdi that utilized copulas to estimate probability based integrated drought index by considering multiple drought indices hao et al 2014 developed the multivariate standardized drought index msdi which is the normalization of the joint probability of accumulated rainfall and soil moisture recently attempts are made to assess the agricultural droughts using the water balance equation cao et al a b c further information on the multivariate drought indices can be obtained from hao and singh 2015 3 3 2 3 hydrological drought hydrological drought is associated with the deficit in surface and subsurface water resources mishra and singh 2010 the meteorological drought can trigger agricultural drought which can lead to hydrological drought sheffield and wood 2007 sheffield et al 2012 traditionally the streamflow anomalies are analyzed to identify the periods of hydrological drought keyantash and dracup 2002 palmer hydrological drought index phdi palmer and drought 1965 is the earliest hydrological drought index phdi works similar to pdsi whereas pdsi considers the end of drought as the moisture deficit begins to subside gradually phdi considers the end of drought when the moisture deficit is subsided completely to assess the hydrological drought heim 2000 keyantash and dracup 2002 phdi does not work in the basins which have snowmelt runoff contribution in the streamflow shukla and wood 2008 developed the surface runoff index sri to characterize hydrological drought to the best of our knowledge no studies have been carried out that integrated remote sensing information into these drought indices in this context west et al 2019 noted that there is relatively limited research in the area of quantifying hydrological droughts compared to that of meteorological and agricultural droughts the launch of grace and its follow on missions in 2002 and 2018 respectively flechtner et al 2014 tapley et al 2004b opened up possibilities of estimating the terrestrial water storage tws components of soil moisture surface and subsurface water in a basin with these missions the research on the application of remote sensing to investigate hydrological groundwater drought flourished the difference between monthly tws anomalies and climatology of tws anomalies with subsequent transformation was applied to identify hydrological droughts sinha et al 2017 thomas et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 yirdaw et al 2008 developed the total storage deficit index tsdi by standardizing the monthly tws anomaly and then combining the outcome at a timestep with that of that previous timestep through an arithmetic weighted summation recently forootan et al 2019 derived a multivariate drought index based on the precipitation and tws to conduct global hydrological drought assessment along with their relationship with climatic teleconnections furthermore grace data is assimilated into hydrological models to study hydrological drought schumacher et al 2018 given its coarse resolution attempts are being made to downscale the grace tws data using hydrological models which can assist in monitoring hydrological droughts zhang et al 2019c groundwater is a crucial component of the hydrological cycle mishra and singh 2010 define groundwater drought as the situation of the below normal groundwater level since the grace mission provides information regarding groundwater storage several studies used grace data to assess groundwater drought the separation of groundwater components from tws estimates is carried out generally using the water balance equation or by using the simulations of land surface models grace estimates are helpful to identify groundwater depletion in a region asoka et al 2017 castle et al 2014 famiglietti et al 2011 huang et al 2015 long et al 2013 richey et al 2015 rodell et al 2009 zhao et al 2019 attempts are being made to utilize grace tws estimates in tandem with interferometric sar data and gps measurement sensors to determine the groundwater depletion castellazzi et al 2018 liu et al 2019 ojha et al 2018 rateb and kuo 2019 some studies assimilated grace data into hydrological models to assess the groundwater depletion döll et al 2014 khaki et al 2018 such grace based data assimilation techniques also carried out to investigate the groundwater droughts li and rodell 2015 li et al 2019 van loon et al 2017 used grace tws anomalies along with hydrological model simulations are to assess the 2015 european groundwater drought on a similar note mishra et al 2016 conducted drought assessment over india using grace anomalies recently thomas et al 2017 proposed grace groundwater drought index ggdi based on normalized grace groundwater storage deviations to study groundwater drought in california central valley recent studies attempted to assimilate the grace data into land surface models to improve the accuracy of groundwater storage information which is expected to contribute towards drought monitoring purposes getirana et al 2019 li et al 2019 3 3 2 4 drought prediction using remote sensing remote sensing information is also used for drought forecasting purposes the drought forecasting is carried out using either statistical models or physical models in an assimilation framework hao et al 2018 in the case of statistical models time series prediction models or regression models are established between appropriate predictors and remotely sensed datasets such as spi spei ndvi vtci soil moisture and tws anomalies among others de linage et al 2014 mishra and desai 2005 2006 mishra et al 2007 park et al 2018 rhee and im 2017 on the other hand remote sensing products are ingested into land surface models in a data assimilation framework to carry out short term as well as long term prediction of droughts mishra and singh 2011 sheffield et al 2014 liu et al 2017 yan et al 2017 satellite remote sensing products are also being utilized in drought early warning systems funk et al 2019 pozzi et al 2013 tadesse et al 2014 3 3 2 5 regional drought analysis using remote sensing regional drought analysis can generate spatio temporal drought information which plays an important role to improve water resources management at a regional scale mishra and singh 2011 the regional analysis integrates different components of the drought characteristics such as duration severity area and frequency mishra and singh 2009 2011 the regional analysis can be carried out using different variables such as drought indices rainfall streamflow and soil moisture alijanian et al 2019 dabanlı et al 2017 hisdal et al 2001 mishra and singh 2009 and these variables can be obtained derived from the remote sensing products the regional drought analysis typically combines more than one drought characteristics for example intensity duration frequency curves hallack alegria and watkins 2007 total areal deficit and maximum deficit intensity tase 1976 severity area duration sad curves andreadis et al 2005 the gauged precipitation data can be used for regional drought analysis or these data can be used to derive standardized precipitation index spi for regional drought assessment mishra and desai 2005 mishra and singh 2008 bonaccorso et al 2015 cai et al 2015 dabanlı et al 2017 the regional drought information is critical for water resources management mishra and singh 2011 alijanian et al 2019 therefore it is important to investigate the regional or spatial behavior of droughts panu and sharma 2002 mishra and singh 2011 bonaccorso et al 2015 especially for data scarce regions mishra and singh 2011 however one of the key limitations is lack of high quality and continuous hydroclimate data to capture spatial coverage in many parts of the world mishra and singh 2011 to overcome such limitations long term satellite datasets can be a reliable alternative source for drought assessments in un gauged basins some of the examples of long term up to 30 years satellite rainfall products are persiann cdr beck et al 2017 and mswep beck et al 2017 although a number of studies investigated the performance of satellite rainfall products for temporal drought analysis limited number of studies investigated the regional drought analysis alijanian et al 2019 in a recent study alijanian et al 2019 evaluated the performance of satellite rainfall estimates persiann cdr and mswep for regional drought analysis for iran and to compare the four major historical severe drought events over the different climatic regions the performance of remote sensing products may differ with respect to gauge data in terms of quantifying drought characteristics e g severity duration and frequency and identification of major historical droughts the performance of selected remote sensing products largely differs in terms of quantifying the frequency component embedded in the regional drought analysis for selected climatic regions located in iran 4 summary in this work we review role of remote sensing in addressing three critical aspects of water security i e i water quality ii water quantity surface and sub surface water resources and iii extreme events this review suggests that the satellite data offers promising results for the monitoring of the aforementioned categories the satellite measurements will increase the observation network to map the water resources globally the use of remotely sensed data for estimating water quality parameters river discharge reservoir monitoring groundwater storage and mapping the extreme events is likely to provide valuable information related to the water availability in order to improve water security of a region following is the summary of the review water quality the spectral properties of clear water are significantly different from polluted water this feature is explored by the remote sensing sensors to monitor water quality the water quality estimation is mostly carried out in the visible region of the spectrum chlorophyll chl concentration turbidity and total suspended solids tss secchi disk depth sdd and colored dissolved organic matter cdom are the most common water quality parameters estimated using the remote sensing datasets attempts are made to establish statistical relationship between water quality parameters and spectral reflectance for this data from landsat modis orbview 2 seawifs meris sentinel 2 and hyperion are increasingly used for chl mapping bandwidths of 675 nm and 700 nm are found to be most useful whereas red and nir bands are found to be useful for turbidity and tss mapping apart from the use of single bands incorporation of reflectance from multiple bands through band ratios is noted to improve water quality parameter estimates by reducing the effect of atmosphere and increasing the signal to noise ratio the sdd is inversely related to turbidity and tss concentration and is therefore estimated using empirical relationships with tss and turbidity similarly cdom is found to be strongly correlated to chl a tss and turbidity levels the lack of extensive availability of remote sensing datasets required for water quality monitoring adds large uncertainties to the estimates highlighting the need for further improvement in the data further most of the algorithms are empirical in nature which requires accurate parameterization that can vary with the optical properties of the water body during recent years the merging of multispectral data with hyperspectral sensor data is also being attempted to accurately determine the water quality parameters water quantity streamflow reservoirs and terrestrial water storage tws contribute to the surface and subsurface water resources in a region satellite altimetric datasets are most commonly used for estimating water levels in rivers and reservoirs a combination of different altimetric datasets is found to be useful for streamflow estimation and reservoir monitoring the earlier altimeter missions were successful in mapping only large rivers and reservoirs due to their large footprint however the recent datasets such as jason 2 jason 3 and saral are capable of monitoring small rivers with varying width besides incorporation of other remotely sensed data pertaining to river widths and paths can significantly improve the river water level estimates apart from altimeter datasets ancillary data pertaining to water surface area channel slope average channel width and velocity of rivers can be obtained from remote sensing datasets and can be used in hydraulic equations to estimate discharge the recent advancements in the data assimilation has shown the potential to improve the water level estimates the upcoming swot mission will be a significant development in estimating river discharge and storage for monitoring changes in tws the grace twin satellite mission is commonly used grace data is also used for mapping groundwater changes and groundwater depletion one of the major limitations of the grace data is its coarse resolution which limits its application at continental scale however efforts are currently being made to disaggregate the tws at fine resolution for hydrologic studies extreme events floods estimation of flood extent is carried out using optical thermal active microwave and passive microwave sensors the optical thermal reflectances are used to develop indices which can indicate the inundated areas and dry areas in a region the applicability of these indices is restricted to daytime cloud free conditions microwave sensors address this issue by providing measurements that have atmosphere penetration capability and are independent of solar illumination in the case of active microwave sensors the sar image after necessary pre processing is subjected to classification algorithms such as image thresholding active contour models and change detection technique etc to identify flooded pixels attempts are made to develop automatic flood extent detection schemes by using a combination of the above methods information from passive microwave sensors can be used to detect the flood extent based on the low emissivity of inundated areas compared to that of dry pixels due to the coarse resolution of brightness temperatures from passive microwave sensors the flood extent analysis can be carried out only on large catchments efforts are in progress to utilize the individual merits of each of the described sensing systems towards the development of global flood inundation maps extreme events droughts satellite remote sensing is used to analyze meteorological agricultural hydrological and groundwater droughts long records of remote sensing based precipitation and et datasets available from the early 1980s are useful to conduct meteorological drought analysis using indices such as spi and spei efforts are made to develop indices to apply with microwave precipitation products in the context of agricultural droughts several drought indices are proposed in the literature which characterizes the persistent soil moisture deficit and vegetation stresses some of the drought indices such as smi swdi essmi etc are developed considering satellite soil moisture products vegetation indices are widely used to determine the vegetation stresses efforts are being made to combine variables affected during agricultural drought such as et lst along with soil moisture and vegetation into drought indices besides such attempts are made through a statistical viewpoint resulting in multivariate drought indices the role of remote sensing in analyzing hydrological and groundwater droughts has become popular with the launch of the grace satellite the tws estimates from grace are used to develop hydrological and groundwater drought indices remote sensing information is now an integral part of drought prediction algorithms the hydrometeorological observations obtained in near real time from operational satellite missions are being utilized in famine early warning systems since remote sensing products have the ability to cover larger spatial extent they are used to carry out regional drought analysis that typically assesses features such as intensity duration frequency severity and area of droughts despite the advantages the systematic differences between the remote sensing products of the same variable may affect the outcome so caution should be exercised while selecting an appropriate product 5 outlook satellite remote sensing plays a vital role in monitoring key hydroclimate variables as well as in managing water resources in this work we review three aspects of the role of remote sensing in assessing water security water quality water quantity and extreme events in this process we reviewed how satellite sensors that measure signals from the earth s surface across various frequencies including optical thermal and microwave spectrum along with gravity field measurements are contributing to the above areas of research we present the following outlook with the wisdom gained from the review most of the water quality parameters such as color dissolved organic matter cdom and secchi disc depth sdd are represented through total suspended sediments there is a need for improvements in the sensing systems as well as retrieval methods that enable direct detection of these parameters at global scales regarding flow estimation most of the research is limited to detecting flows in large rivers such as mekong congo amazon ganga and brahmaputra although the research is still advancing to improving the flow measurement accuracies efforts should also be directed towards developing a framework to monitor rivers of all widths at the global scale besides detecting flows over transboundary rivers with reservoirs pose additional challenges the upcoming swot mission biancamaria et al 2016 is anticipated to address these issues the current altimeters have low temporal resolution in the order of tens of days which makes it challenging to monitor rivers one way of overcoming this limitation is to fuse multi satellite information tourian et al 2013 furthermore since most of the altimeters are intended to monitor ocean surface they have limitations of echoes from land while monitoring inland water bodies tarpanelli et al 2019 which need to be addressed grace and grace fo provide valuable information on the terrestrial water storage which include surface and sub surface water resources efforts should be directed towards downscaling these products for diversifying their applications in the areas of irrigation and drinking water supply among others flood monitoring can be further improved with the usage of multiple satellites that alleviate the issues of cloud cover spatial resolution and overpass time during the flooding event quantifying the anatomy of an agricultural drought remains a challenge due to our limited understanding of root zone soil moisture availability for crop growth mishra et al 2015 therefore there is a need to improve our understanding of soil moisture signals in different types of environments to improve agricultural water management the continuous development in remote sensing products e g smap smos amsr 2 and sentinel missions and assimilating them into land surface model can generate root zone soil moisture das and mohanty 2006 de lannoy and reichle 2016 li et al 2010 liu and mishra 2017 martens et al 2017 reichle et al 2017 reichle et al 2019 to improve agricultural drought management in addition remote sensing soil moisture products can expand the capability to map soil moisture deficit with global coverage and it can significantly compliment to the sparse in situ soil moisture networks the mapping capability of satellite remote sensing products opens a new window on the onset and evolution of droughts at regional to national scale mishra et al 2017 there is a need to ingest the information of varying temporal scales at which the hydro meteorological variables behave while characterizing droughts for instance the role of persistence of soil moisture profile on agricultural droughts is yet to be well understood remote sensing products can be useful for regional drought assessment in ungagged basins remote sensing data should be promoted among the stakeholders to develop regional drought management plans to improve water security by integrating multivariate nature of drought events this is especially important for data scare regions in many parts of the world progress in several of the above mentioned directions requires efforts to develop science to obtain hyper spatio temporal resolution remote sensing products projects such as smos hr high resolution rodríguez fernández et al 2019 which is still at concept stage may fill this requirement credit authorship

5582,understanding water flow paths and chemical inputs from the catchment to downstream water bodies is essential for determining sensitivity and response of water resources to climatic land use and environmental changes multivariate analysis of hydrochemical data and estimation of water balance using chloride as a chemical tracer and oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes in water as physical tracers were applied to explore surface and subsurface hydrological pathways of water organic and inorganic solutes in the unmanaged mountain catchment of plešné lake czech republic nitrate 18o and 15n data were used to support hydrochemical data and hydrological pathways identification our results showed that even small variations of water transit time had an important influence on chemical composition in surface and subsurface flows water flowing through the subsurface weathered granite had mean transit time of about 11 months and a higher content of geogenic ions due to longer contact with bedrock materials in contrast surface flows with a transit time of about 5 months had higher concentrations of dissolved organic carbon total phosphorus and organic nitrogen due to a higher proportion of water originating from the upper organic rich soil horizon stratification of oxygen isotopes in the water column of the lake were related to subsurface inlets into the lake our results were used to describe the transformation of chemical and isotopic signals by surface and subsurface hydrological pathways in the sensitive headwater catchment keywords stable isotopes in water stable isotopes in nitrate water transit time hydrochemistry water balance lake 1 introduction understanding how catchments transfer chemical and water inputs is important for determining hydrological and hydrochemical variations water balance sensitivity and response of water resources to climatic land use and environmental changes kidmose et al 2013 lewandowski et al 2015 as precipitation surface and subsurface waters often differ in their physical chemical and biological properties water exchange between these hydrological compartments can have significant impacts on catchment hydrology solute fluxes and aquatic ecological diversity crossman et al 2011 despite a wide range of available hydrochemical approaches hydrological tools and hydrometric techniques e g kalbus et al 2006 the quantification of hydrological pathways and particularly subsurface flows in streams and lakes remains challenging crossman et al 2011 the problem often lies in limitations of the methods the dependency of results on the site specific hydrological characteristics or remoteness of sites where the data are and will remain incomplete or missing laudon et al 2017 the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water δ 18o and δ 2h as natural hydrological tracers provide useful additional information on water origin and transit time in the catchment and for disentangling surface and subsurface flows stets et al 2010 tetzlaff et al 2015 the utility of δ 18o and δ 2h relies on origin and seasonal variations in different hydrological compartments as follows i winter snow is more depleted in heavy isotopes 18o and 2h than summer rain due to low temperatures and reduced evaporation ii surface water exposed to evaporation becomes more enriched in heavy isotopes compared to the source and iii longer water transit time generally leads to isotopic averaging and lower variance and seasonal amplitudes of stable isotope proportions in runoff and groundwater compared to seasonally dependent precipitation mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 soulsby et al 2015 jasechko et al 2017 thus the stable isotopes of water can be used to determine lake water budgets gibson et al 2016a b and

multi tracer applications can help to discern the distribution and connectivity between permeable deposits through which water flow pathways develop leibundgut et al 2009 in many studies and models

peck and hurle 1973 especially at sites where atmospheric cl inputs exceed 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 svensson et al 2012 concentrations of cl are usually introduced to terrestrial catchments by rainfall and

15n and 18o are widely used to identify nitrogen sources and to unravel biogeochemical processes in natural and anthropized surface water and groundwater kendall et al 2008 hundey et al 2016 matiatos 2016 jung et al 2020 the aim of this study was to improve our understanding of hydrological pathways in relation to water quality in a small catchment by applying hydrochemical and stable isotopic tracers we selected the headwater mountain plešné lake catchment located in the natural park šumava at south west czechia in which the human activity is highly restricted small catchments 500 km2 are highly sensitive to environmental and anthropogenic impacts due to relatively rapid water and material cycles short hydrological pathways and more intensive groundwater surface water interaction thomas et al 2011 wagener et al 2007 moreover small headwater catchments with lakes are ideal observatories to study nutrients and other chemicals dynamics because they allow integral investigations of pathways from surface via soil and groundwater lakes serve as a cumulative pool of materials turnover and cycling while detailed hydrochemical studies in the catchment are available for more than a decade kopáček et al 2004 2017 2019 the relationship of chemistry to hydrological pathways water transit time contribution of seasonal precipitation to surface and subsurface water flows and contribution of subsurface inlet to the total lake water input are largely unknown previously vystavna et al 2018 we determined the isotopic response of the catchment in relation to its forest status and approximated evaporation transpiration and water transit time in forested versus deforested catchments based on 1 year of stable isotope monitoring we showed hydrological and hydrogeological features of the catchment play an important role in water and element distribution but our understanding of the links between water chemical composition and hydrological processes was insufficient to fully confirm this hypothesis vystavna et al 2018 here we fill this knowledge gap to answer questions on how the hydrological pathways in this small headwater catchment transform the chemical and isotopic signals derived from the precipitation the objectives of our study were to i describe hydrological hydrochemical and stable isotopic patterns of surface and subsurface flows and test whether these patterns differed among lake inlets ii use stable water isotopes and cl to estimate annual water balance of the lake and to compare the results of both approaches iii approximate the amount and location of the subsurface inlet contribution to the lake and iv to evaluate relations between water transit time and hydrochemistry of individual lake inlets the proposed approach can be suitable in other lake catchments to evaluate hydrological sensitivity to climatic land use and other changes 2 method and materials 2 1 site description the plešné lake catchment is situated in the boreal bohemian forest central europe 48 46 6 n 13 51 9 e 150 km southwest of prague the lake is a former glacial tarn with a surface level at 1090 m a s l with a surface area of 7 2 ha a maximum depth of 18 m and a volume of 0 553 million m3 of which 48 33 18 and 1 are at the depth layers of 0 5 5 10 10 15 and deeper than 15 m respectively lake water residence time is annually variable in a range of 0 5 to 1 3 years with a long term average of 0 9 year kopáček et al 2017 plešné lake usually stratifies during winter and summer periods kopáček et al 2019 the catchment area is 67 ha including the lake with a maximum relief of 288 m and average slope of 27 5 janský and šobr 2003 the soils of the catchment are sandy 75 and low in clay content 2 and include shallow leptosols 38 podsols 29 and dystric cambisols 27 with an average soil depth of 33 cm the remaining ground surface is bare rock 5 and wetland 1 kaňa et al 2014 the bedrock is composed of weathered two mica granite and granodiorite that have magnesium rich biotite sodium and calcium rich plagioclase potassium feldspar quartz with minor amounts of muscovite and biotite mica czech geological survey 2019 from a hydrogeological point of view the dominant bedrock type has low permeability plešné lake has two surface pl 1 and pl 2 and one subsurface pl 4 inlets fig 1 another inlet pl 3 was subsurface until 2001 and was exposed when the lake water level dropped by 0 5 m due to outlet re construction there are more boulders and scree in the sub catchments of pl 3 and pl 4 compared to more solid rock in the pl 1 and pl 2 sub catchments therefore subsurface flow is largely restricted to bedrock fissures as well as preferential flow in the thin 0 5 m weathered zone janský and šobr 2003 most 93 of the mature norway spruce forest that covered 90 of the catchment died during a bark beetle ips typographus infestation between 2004 and 2008 all dead forest biomass was left in the catchment to preserve natural conditions kopáček et al 2017 at present young forest is rapidly regenerating in the catchment water chemical composition in surface inlets pl 1 and pl 2 that changed during forest dieback have largely returned to pre infestation levels kopáček et al 2017 exceptions are dissolved organic carbon doc total organic nitrogen ton total phosphorus tp and dissolved reactive phosphorus drp their concentrations continue to rise or stabilize at their elevated levels after tree dieback due to increased availability of decomposing organic matter elevated soil moisture and lateral water flows through the uppermost organic rich soil horizons kopáček et al 2017 2018 2 2 meteorological and hydrological data the climate at plešné lake is cold with an average annual air temperature of 4 7 c and annual precipitation of 1300 mm the typical annual hydrological cycle is dominated by snowmelt which produces high discharge in streams during spring runoff vystavna et al 2018 snowpack accumulation usually starts in november with maximum snow accumulation in march the snowpack is fully melted by the end of april kopáček et al 2011 meteorological data from the nearby churáňov weather station was provided by the czech hydrometeorological institute precipitation amount was measured at three sites differing in elevation in the plešné catchment kopáček et al 2017 precipitation was collected at 2 week intervals using polyethylene collectors situated 1 5 2 m above the ground and protected from animals light and evaporation sample container was placed in a white insulated box connected to the collector via capillary tubing snow amount was measured at 2 to 4 week intervals using high density polyethylene cylinders situated 2 2 5 m above the ground outflow from the lake qout was monitored at 15 minute intervals using a calibrated weir and gauge recorder ms16 automatic weather station fiedler ams české budějovice discharge q in inlets was measured at the time of sampling at a 2 3 week intervals using a stopwatch and calibrated container at small natural waterfalls or rapids except for pl 4 subsurface spring whose discharge could not be measured annual evapotranspiration from the catchment and lake was estimated based on atmospheric water inputs to soils and on the lake surface discharge from the lake and mass balance of cl in the lake as described in detail in section 2 5 2 3 hydrochemical data 2 3 1 sampling and analysis precipitation samples in the catchment along with samples from the churáňov station water samples from lake inflows pl 1 pl 2 pl 3 and pl 4 and from the outflow pl o were collected from november 2016 to october 2018 i e during two hydrological years samples were collected near the inflow into the lake for pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 in a shallow well for pl 4 and at the lake outlet the lake water column depth profile was sampled at the deepest part of the lake at five different depths 0 5 4 8 12 and 16 m several times in 2017 water samples were pre filtered through a 200 µm polyethylene sieve for precipitation and through 40 µm polyamide filters for the rest of water samples and stored in the dark at 4 c until analysis chemical analysis was done in institute of hydrobiology biology centre of the academy of sciences of the czech republic major cations nh4 ca2 mg2 na and k and anions no3 cl so4 2 and f were analysed using ion chromatography dionex icf 3000

differences between concentrations of total and dissolved n forms and the sum of mineral n forms no3 and nh4 ph was measured by the gran titration the accuracy of the analytical results was controlled by balancing ionic charges including concentrations of organic acid anions and ionic aluminium and iron forms kopáček et al 2000 the differences between the sums of all cations and anions were 5 of the total ionic concentration in the individual water samples water temperature was measured onsite using thermometers 2 3 2 evaluation of water chemical composition we tested for differences in chemical and physical characteristics of surface and subsurface water flows with a tukey test significance level 0 05 for this purpose the geochemical data were tested for the normal distribution using the kolmogorov smirnov test and log transformed if necessary as described by vystavna et al 2017 the equivalent mol of charge concentrations of six major ions were plotted in modified stiff 1951 diagrams from annual volume weighed means using the r swmrgraphs package hem 1989 multivariate analysis was performed to test the hypothesis on statistically significant differences in hydrochemical variables between hydrological components precipitation surface and subsurface flows principal component analyses pca included individual samples of surface and subsurface flows the lake and the precipitation concentrations of ca2 and mg2 were highly correlated as were doc drp and tdp therefore ca2 drp and tdp were excluded from the pca to avoid distortions nitrate and silica were excluded from the pca because their concentrations were related to discharge which would confuse the desired spatial and seasonal effects with an event related patterns for pca we log x 1 transformed concentrations and standardized each variable between 0 and 1 legendre and legendre 2012 to test for significant differences between lake inlets a nonparametric equivalent to a manova multivariate analysis of variances adonis was performed by site and year this was followed by a post hoc pairwise test pairwiseadonis martinez 2019 for differences amongst groups the statistical analyses were performed in r 3 3 5 r core team 2019 mineral saturation indices for collected water samples were calculated using phreeqc software version 3 0 the saturation index appelo and postma 2005 was calculated based on the activities of free ions in solution a mineral saturation index of 0 indicates equilibrium between mineral phase and the water while positive saturation index indicates supersaturation and negative saturation index reflects undersaturation 2 4 stable isotope data 2 4 1 sampling and analysis precipitation samples for stable isotopes were collected at the churáňov weather station id 11457 49 04 n 13 37 e 1118 m a s l daily precipitation was accumulated in a container for precipitation and combined for every calendar month the collection of precipitation was done according to the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip protocols of the international atomic energy agency iaea to guarantee the post collection integrity of the samples see isotopehydrologynetwork iaea org water samples for δ 18o and δ 2h analysis were collected from lake inlets and outlet simultaneously with samples for hydrochemical analysis water samples were transferred in 50 ml high density polyethylene bottles with screw caps and liners and stored at room temperature hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope analyses were conducted by cavity ringdown laser spectroscopy picarro l2120 i and l2130 i in the institute of hydrology slovak academy of sciences slovakia each sample was analysed at least twice using seven injections per vial and memory correction using the analytical protocol adapted from holko 2016 the results were referenced against internal laboratory standards calibrated against primary reference materials and reported in the δ values in relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow δ 18o and δ 2h values of the heavy standard were 1 73 and 11 6 respectively the values for the light standard were 16 88 and 122 1 typical precision expressed as the one year variance of an internal control standard was better than 0 1 and 1 0 for δ 18o and δ 2h respectively nitrate isotope analysis was carried out by the denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 by converting nitrate to n2o an isotope ratio mass spectrometer gasbenchii delta v plus thermo fisher scientific usa was used for determination of δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 the results were compared with those for internal laboratory standards calibrated against primary reference materials and were expressed as relative to the standards air for δ 15n no3 and v smow for δ 18o no3 typical precision expressed as the one year variance in an internal control standard was better than 0 6 for δ 15n no3 and 0 4 for δ 18o no3 respectively 2 4 2 calculations a local meteoric water line lmwl n 24 was constructed using the reduced major axis regression method crawford et al 2014 the determined correlation equation was compared to the global meteoric water line described as δ 2h 8 δ 18o 10 craig 1961 the isotopic compositions of water flows were compared to the lmwl to examine relative variation and difference in isotopic composition of hydrological components deuterium excess d excess δ 2h 8 δ 18o was used as an indicator for non equilibrium conditions which occur during evaporation where water with d excess 10 was presumed to have undergone some evaporation dansgaard 1964 the mean water transit time in lake inflows was estimated according to herrmann and stichler 1981 1 τ r 1 f 2 1 2 π where τr is the water transit time in years and f is the ratio of the δ 18o amplitudes in the water flow b compared to the δ 18o amplitudes in precipitation a that was calculated for two years data series as 2 f b a the method was applied to approximate and compare the water transit time between lake inlets assuming that the isotopic lapse rate in precipitation was insignificant owing to the small differences in elevation between sub catchments vystavna et al 2018 a two component mixing model vystavna et al 2018 was used to estimate the contribution of precipitation from warm and cold seasonal periods based on annual flow weighted δ 18o value in lake inlets and the annual amount weighted aw mean δ 18o value in cold and warm seasons precipitation the dual δ 15n no3 vs δ 18o no3 linear regression plot based on kendall 1998 kendall et al 2008 was evaluate

hydrological years and derived from annual precipitation amount hpr m yr 1 continuously monitored discharge of the lake outflow qout m3 yr 1 and the in lake budget of cl according to kopáček et al 2017 2019 the total water input into the lake qin m3 yr 1 was estimated from catchment water yield total terrestrial water export qte m3 yr 1 and direct atmospheric precipitation on the lake surface qpr m3 yr 1 the latter was calculated as 3 qpr hpr al where al m2 is lake area the qte was computed using the measured qout and qpr annual volume weighted mean cl concentration in precipitation clpr annual discharge and time weighted mean cl concentrations in the lake inlets pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 and outflow clout annual time weighted mean cl concentration in pl 4 and change in the storage of cl in the lake δcll the annual average cl concentrations in four inlets clte were calculated as arithmetic means for individual inlets because the cl concentrations in all lake inlets were similar the δcll values were calculated as 4 δcll v c2 c1 where v m3 is lake volume and c1 and c2 both in mol m 3 are volume weighted mean in lake cl concentrations the c1 and c2 values were obtained from data on samples taken from five depths between the surface and bottom at the deepest part of the lake at the beginning 1 and the end 2 of each hydrological year respectively by linking volumes of the sampled water layers with the corresponding concentrations the net removal or production of cl within the lake was assumed to be negligible van der perk 2006 therefore the terrestrial water yield qte was calculated as 5 qte qout clout qpr clpr δcll clte taking into account that the lake is a flow through system of a headwater catchment we assumed that inflows originated from precipitation and that evaporation losses from the lake were compensated by inflows e g gibson et al 2016a b the hydrological steady state conditions in the lake observed during the mixing period and the isotopic mass balance during this period were estimated according to gibson et al 2016a b as 6 iδ i q δ q e δ e where i m3 yr 1 is total water inflow into the lake including precipitation surface and subsurface flows e is the evaporation flux q m3 yr 1 is the lake outflow and δ i and δ q are the amount weighted aw mean isotopic compositions of total inflow and outflow the isotopic composition of the

composition of the lake outflow respectively qsurf m3 yr 1 and δ surf were the discharge and aw isotopic composition of tributaries pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 respectively and δ sub was the annual weighted aw isotopic composition of the subsurface inflow pl 4 we assumed that old groundwater was not contributing into this headwater lake due to low permeability of the bedrock and based on previous evidence of the absence of a deeper aquifer in the plešné catchment vystavna et al 2018 additionally for the isotopic mass balance of the lake we approximated the δ l in several ways i using the well mixed conditions in autumn when all layers had the same delta values and ii using the volume weighted delta value of the lake outflow both methods showed identical delta values the standard deviation was 5 thus considering the focus on annual water balance eqs 6 and 9 we used the aw mean value estimated for the outflow 3 results 3 1 hydrometeorological conditions isotopic composition of precipitation lake inlets and outlet annual average air temperature and annual precipitation amounts differed between the two hydrological years with higher values in 2018 fig 2 table 1 during the study period the δ 18o values in monthly precipitation at the churáňov station varied from 6 1 to 15 0 δ 2h varied from 41 0 to 110 2 and d excess was from 5 2 to 16 fig 2 the aw mean of δ 18o in precipitation was 10

the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes were correlated with air temperature positively and with relative humidity negatively however no significant correlation was found with precipitation amount the correlation with temperature was low for november 2016 and december 2017 which were months with low δ 18o 14 1 and 15 respectively and δ 2h 100 3 and 108 5 respectively values we modelled the trajectories of air masses delivering moisture to the site during these two months and have found that most resulting in 70 of precipitation amount at the churáňov station originated from the north atlantic thus being imprinted with the low isotopic ratios of the moisture source fig s1 in supplementary information isotopic values of the inlets and outlet of the lake were within the range of precipitation the stable isotopes in surface and subsurface flows were slightly above the lmwl fig 3 a with more depleted aw mean of δ 18o 10 8 over the entire two year survey compared to the pl 1 and pl 2 inlets pl 3 had lower aw mean of δ 18o 11 1 and pl 4 was even more negative 11 3 isotopic values of the pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 inlets were well distributed along the churáňov lmwl but those of the subsurface inlet pl 4 were less variable fig 3a the aw mean of δ 18o in the lake outflow was 9 2 the regression line of the lake outflow fig 3a represented the local evaporation line lel with a slope of 5 2 and an interception point below the aw mean of the churáňov precipitation but was close to the aw mean of δ 18o value for pl 3 the amplitude of δ 18o in inlets were decreasing from pl 1 to pl 4 fig 3b the calculated water transit time in pl 1 pl 2 pl 3 and pl 4 were 5 5 7 and 11 months respectively water transit time in the lake was estimated at 9 5 months as calculated using a two component mixing model the contribution of the warm season precipitation to the recharge of surface and subsurface flows was 45 for pl 1 and pl 2 38 for pl 3 and 30 for pl 4 without a significant p 0 05 inter annual difference 3 2 hydrochemical composition and stable isotopes of nitrate in lake inlets and outlet the average water ph in lake inflows pl 1 pl 2 pl 3 and pl 4 was 4 3 4 4 4 6 and 4 9 respectively the lake outflow had a higher ph of 5 4 water temperature varied seasonally in pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 with the range between 0 7 and 11 6 c but was relatively constant in pl 4 with values 4 8 c table s1 in supplementary information in the stiff type plot fig 4 a and b pl 1 and pl 2 exhibited similar major ion compositions pl 3 had higher so4 2 ca2 and no3 concentrations the subsurface pl 4 had the highest so4 2 mg2 ca2 and no3 concentrations among all lake inflows on the first pca plot fig 5 a the values representing precipitation turquoise did not overlap with any other values and were far from inflow samples along the first component which explained 65 of the variation axis x along the second component 18 of the variance the largely overlapping values of pl 1 and pl 2 were separate from pl 3 and pl 4 precipitation samples were characterized by high nh4 and bicarbonate the nh4 and bicarbonate loadings plotted in the vicinity of the samples from precipitation geogenic ions such as na k mg2 but also so4 2 which in the catchment still derives from atmospheric deposition originally deposited in the soil and now continuously released majer et al 2003 had high positive loadings on the first component characterizing lake inflow samples the loadings of f and mg2 ca2 plotted furthest up in the plot next to the samples from pl 4 indicating that pl 4 was characterized by higher concentrations of these elements in contrast pl 4 was low in proton concentrations expressed by high ph values the tp and doc concentrations were at the opposite end of the second component thus negatively correlated to ph f and mg2 ca2 but characteristic for pl 1 and pl 2 tributaries fig 5a since precipitation was distinctive from the lake inflows in a second pca we excluded precipitation fig 5b the four lake inlets were separated along the first component 48 of variances the overlapping pl 1 and pl 2 samples were clearly separated from pl 3 and pl 4 samples here again pl 1 and pl 2 were characterized by high doc and tp mg2 ca2 and f were at the opposite end of the first component and negatively correlated with doc and tp the pl 3 samples were between the pl 4 and overlapping pl 1 and pl 2 samples displaying properties of both surface and subsurface flows while the first component explained the spatial separation the second component could be a temporal dimension since cold colours i e samples from cold months plotted to the bottom and samples with warm colours were characterized by high temperature at the top of the plot as typical for the warm months the multivariate inter annual differences adonis r2 0 01 p 0 8 in physical and chemical variables were not significant but the differences between inlets and precipitation were significant adonis r2 0 80 p 0 001 the post hoc test revealed significant differences in physical and chemical variables for all pairs of inlets and precipitation pairwiseadonis r2 between 0 41 and 0 81 adjusted p 0 01 except for the pair pl 1 and pl 2 pairwiseadonis r2 0 08 adjusted p 0 38 results of phreeqc modelling showed that all four inlets were supersaturated the saturation index was 0 with respect to goethite feooh hematite fe2o3 and talc mg3si4o10 oh 2 this model also showed that pl 1 and pl 2 were saturated with respect to quartz sio2 and pl 3 and pl 4 were saturated with chrysotile mg3si2o5 oh 4 in the lake inlets no3 concentrations increased by a factor of three from pl 1 to pl 4 fig 4a and b in the lake outlet the no3 concentration was lowest 0 001 mg l 1 n the δ 15n νο3 value was higher in pl 1 and pl 2 2 3 and

isotopes of no3 in samples were within the range reported in kendall 1998 for no3 originating from a mixture of 18o enriched atmospheric deposition pl o nitrification of nh4 in the soil pl 1 and pl 2 and nh4 deposited with precipitation pl 3 and pl 4 compared to other inlets pl 4 had not only lower δ 15n no3 values but also lower δ 18o no3 isotopic values of pl 1 and pl 2 plotted along a 2 1 denitrification line fig 6 3 3 water balances and lake stratification the two hydrological years were slightly different in terms of water balance components the precipitation amount water fluxes and outflow from the lake were 20 higher water residence time in the lake was 20 lower and evapotranspiration was 10 lower in 2018 than in 2017 table 1 for this study we used δ 18o for isotope mass balance due to the strong correlation between h and o isotopes water yields from the catchment estimated using the isotope and cl mass balances were similar table 1 the calculated evaporation inflow ratio e i of the lake was 7 in each year the estimated annual subsurface contribution into the lake was 52 and 55 of the total water inputs to the lake in 2017 and 2018 respectively table 1 the temperature profile suggested that the lake completely mixed in october 2016 fig 7 this was corroborated by the δ 18o values which were vertically homogeneous 8 9 and only slightly higher compared to the δ 18o aw mean of the lake outflow during the ice on period that lasted from late november to april water temperature was 2 c near the surface and 4 c in the deeper layers the δ 18o aw values decreased in the surface layer and in the depth of 8 m at the end of january 2017 and further at the bottom at the end of february 2017 in mid march 2017 the layers from 4 to 12 m had a similar δ 18o composition 9 1 and the δ 18o depletion was observed only in the surface layer 10 0 and at the bottom 9 6 during the ice off period the hypolimnion water temperature was 5 c from the bottom to the depth of 8 m and rapidly increased to 20 c at the thermocline in the depth of 3 4 m during the period of intensive evaporation that occurred in june august the δ 18o values were 8 2 at the lake surface but at the depths from 4 to 12 m were homogenous and indicated a depletion in 18o 10 1 with a small deviation at the bottom 10 3 at the beginning of september 2017 the lake surface was even more 18o enriched 8 0 fig 7 as shown in the box whiskers plot fig 8 the deeper layers of the lake had lower values of δ 18o than water at depths of 0 5 m and 4 m the δ 18o composition in the lake outflow showed variations like those at the lake surface fig 8 4 discussion comparing stable water isotopes in inflows and the lake we found that isotopic signatures of surface and subsurface water fell within the range of those measured in precipitation fig 3a however the variations of isotope values were different amongst hydrological components fig 3b stable water isotopes in precipitation at the churáňov station displayed strong seasonal variation with more negative values in winter and higher values in summer fig 2 typical for continental climate dansgaard 1964 as expected seasonal isotopic variation was largely dampened in the lake inflows compared to precipitation as shown by the less scattered distribution of isotopic data in pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 and even lower scatter in the subsurface pl 4 fig 3a and b the isotope based calculation revealed that water transit times in pl 1 and pl 2 5 months were only about half of that in subsurface pl 4 11 months the lake inflow pl 3 was intermediate between surface and subsurface inflows with water transit time of 7 months the more depleted isotopic values in pl 4 suggested that this subsurface inflow was dominantly recharged by the seasonal snowmelt tetzlaff et al 2015 this was confirmed by the results of two component mixing model which showed a dominant contribution of the cold season precipitation to pl 4 the difference in the water transit times among the four inflows can be explained by specific hydrological conditions within the catchment vertical drainage in the freely draining soil layer recharges subsurface flow however the soil cover in the catchment is usually thin at some areas within the catchment the bedrock consists of fractured granite such fractured rocks are known to receive drained water from deeper stores which increases water residence time and likely explains the decreased seasonal variation of δ 18o signature observed in pl 4 these stores can be variable in size distribution and hydraulic properties soulsby et al 2000 surface lake inflows pl 1 and pl 2 showed a seasonally varying δ 18o that evolved during the year in response to precipitation inputs indicating water with a shorter transit time or young water soulsby et al 2000 may dominate in these tributaries however to confirm this interpretation a longer period of isotopic observations is recommended the difference in water transit time between lake inflows was an important determinant of the water chemical composition stiff plots and pca clearly separated precipitation from lake inflows figs 4a b and 5a and clearly separated pl 4 and pl 3 with the longer transit time from the surface hydrological pathways figs 4a b and 5b water chemical composition in the surface inlets pl 1 and pl 2 varied widely particularly along the second component in the fig 5b indicating strong seasonality and reflecting short residence times which points to mixing of different water sources at different times the high ton tp and doc concentrations characterizing the surface tributaries pl 1 and pl 2 were related to shallower soils in their sub catchments and to more frequent lateral flows and elevated biomass degradation after tree dieback kaňa et al 2015 kopáček et al 2017 oulehle et al 2019 these water components do not usually reach deeper soils or bedrock fractures since they are either degraded or adsorbed to the soil matrix over time the more frequent lateral flows due to elevated soil moisture after tree dieback kopáček et al 2018 further shortened the naturally short water residence time in these sub catchments decreased the effect of weathering and increased the role of biomass degradation on ionic and nutrient composition of the inlets pl 1 and pl 2 due to the extended water transit time in pl 3 and pl 4 water has longer contact with the rocks this might lead to their oversaturation with geogenic ions found by the phreeqc simulations mg2 and ca2 interaction mainly with weathered rock materials but less with the soil could explain why these geogenic ions dominated water composition of pl 4 while its doc and tp concentrations were low the higher concentration of so4 2 for lake inflows compared to the precipitation was explained by sulphur forms accumulated in soils from elevated atmospheric deposition during the last century and microbially oxidization to so4 2 oulehle et al 2019 however geogenic sulphate can be formed from s bearing minerals in soil and rocks this required additional study with the application of the stable isotopes of so4 2 to help differentiate biogenic and geogenic sulphates in tributaries jezierski et al 2006 according to the result of the phreeqc model it was suggested that poorly soluble minerals of the serpentine group like chrysotile could occur in tributaries with a longer residence time pl 3 and pl 4 however the presence of these minerals in the fractured granite needs to be verified by mineralogical analysis kuzvart 1984 the extended residence time and dominance of weathering with little inputs from the surface were further indicated by the low temporal variation of water chemistry in pl 4 the results of nitrate isotope analyses added another layer of complexity to the interpretations based only on water isotopes and hydrochemical concentrations despite the small number of nitrate isotope samples composition of inflows reflected different sources and biogeochemical processes as shown by their unique δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values in the dual δ 15n no3 vs δ 18o no3 relationship fig 6 according to kendall 1998 and kendall et al 2008 pl 1 and pl 2 exhibited 18o to 15n in nitrate representative for the soil passage the nitrate isotope data of pl 3 and pl 4 in contrast fell into the source window of nh4 in precipitation and fertilizers kendall 1998 however given that no fertilizers or other chemicals are applied in this area these two samples likely represent the nh4 precipitation signal the δ 15n no3 vs δ 18o no3 relation in nitrate in pl 3 and even more so in pl 4 was indeed characteristic of the signature found for ammonium in precipitation kendall 1998 kendall et al 2008 we suggest that nitrate isotope patterns at sites pl 3 and pl 4 indicate that recharge with precipitation presumably accumulated in subsurface storage over a longer time than in pl 1 and pl 2 the nitrate found in pl 1 and pl 2 probably did not reach pl 3 and pl 4 due to its longer residence time in their sub catchments allowing larger extent of its assimilation or denitrification in soils the isotope results further indicate that the sites received different proportions of nitrate derived from nitrification of soil organic nitrogen and atmospheric nh4 as can be seen from the signals not overlapping in fig 6 the atmospheric nitrate deposition in central european precipitation usually had more enriched 18o value of between 50 and 80 i matiatos iaea personal communication the lake outflow showed a mixture of no3 originating from 18o enriched nitrate in precipitation and 18o depleted in lake inflows such as in the samples pl 3 and pl 4 the reason for the difference in δ 15n no3 values between pl 3 and pl 4 might be caused by different microbial and physical conditions in their sub catchments manifested e g by different ph and doc serca et al 1994 although the number of sites is limited we could assume isotope fractionation of δ 15n no3 driven by the mineralization of organic matter which is present in the soil thus the soil may represent a significant nitrogen source kendall et al 2008 for the surface inlets even though based on a limited set of data the observed between inlet differences in isotopic nitrate composition suggest that hydrological pathways are important determinants of the nitrate mixing and distribution in the plešné catchment distinct cl concentrations in precipitation lake inflows and outflow allowed us to evaluate the water balance of the lake table 1 however the negligible differences in cl concentrations between surface and subsurface flows made it impossible to fully estimate their relative contribution to the lake instead δ 18o with distinct values among surface and subsurface flows was used for this purpose while isotope mass balance method are also affected by uncertainties associated with assumptions of steady state conditions isokangas et al 2015 results on the catchment water yield and lake water residence time provided by both δ 18o and cl balances were in reasonable agreement table 1 the catchment water yield based on the δ 18o balance was 10 and 4 higher than that provided by the cl balance in 2017 and 2018 respectively small deviations 9 lower in 2017 and 3 higher in 2018 were also found for the δ 18o based lake water residence times compared to those based on the cl balance the δ 18o balance showed that total subsurface flow represented about a half of the catchment water yield similarly to many boreal forest lakes in finland and canada turner et al 2010 isokangas et al 2015 gibson et al 2016a b contribution of the subsurface flow was also traced in the isotopic stratification in the lake figs 7a b and 8 during the period of the thermal stratification more depleted isotopic composition of water at the depth of 8 m and its lower seasonal variation indicated deep inflows of water with a longer residence time than in the surface inlets another deep inflow of subsurface water likely occurred to the bottom layer fig 8 the occurrence of the subsurface inflows at the different depths can be explained by different degree of bedrock fracturing in the individual sub catchments the steep plešné catchment has been affected by rock avalanches janský and šobr 2003 we assume that more big boulders and fragmented rocks are below soils in the southeast part of the lake wall i e in the sub catchment of pl 4 on fig 1 than in the rest of the catchment this could additionally explain the longer transit time of water in the pl 4 inlet and significant portion of subsurface deep water inflows to the lake similar conditions were also described elsewhere for catchments with weathered granite bedrock e g soulsby et al 2000 5 conclusions based on the results derived from the application of multi tracer approach we concluded that flows in the plešné catchment were more complex than initially anticipated and suggested a diverse set of subsurface flow patterns leading to inlets into the lake we found that chemical and isotopic compositions of surface and subsurface inlets were correlated to differences in water transit time and degree of interaction with soil and rock materials our results showed that even at the smaller scale and within a year variation water transit time was found to be an important determinant of hydrochemical characteristics by prolonging the interaction of hydrological pathways with weathered rock materials additionally water flow redistribution due to geological setting played an important role in elements transport interfering the relative importance of hydrological pathways at the catchment and sub catchment scales as traced by isotopic and chemical parameters while we sampled obvious inflows it is also possible that other subsurface inflows contribute to the lake they might account for some of the variability in the lake stratification isotope signals which we could not fully explain by the contributions of these four inlets credit authorship contribution statement y vystavna conceptualization methodology writing original draft s i schmidt formal

5582,understanding water flow paths and chemical inputs from the catchment to downstream water bodies is essential for determining sensitivity and response of water resources to climatic land use and environmental changes multivariate analysis of hydrochemical data and estimation of water balance using chloride as a chemical tracer and oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes in water as physical tracers were applied to explore surface and subsurface hydrological pathways of water organic and inorganic solutes in the unmanaged mountain catchment of plešné lake czech republic nitrate 18o and 15n data were used to support hydrochemical data and hydrological pathways identification our results showed that even small variations of water transit time had an important influence on chemical composition in surface and subsurface flows water flowing through the subsurface weathered granite had mean transit time of about 11 months and a higher content of geogenic ions due to longer contact with bedrock materials in contrast surface flows with a transit time of about 5 months had higher concentrations of dissolved organic carbon total phosphorus and organic nitrogen due to a higher proportion of water originating from the upper organic rich soil horizon stratification of oxygen isotopes in the water column of the lake were related to subsurface inlets into the lake our results

fluxes and aquatic ecological diversity crossman et al 2011 despite a wide range of available hydrochemical approaches hydrological tools and hydrometric techniques e g kalbus et al 2006 the quantification of hydrological pathways and particularly subsurface flows in streams and lakes remains challenging crossman et al 2011 the problem often lies in limitations of the methods the dependency of results on the site specific hydrological characteristics or remoteness of sites where the data are and will remain incomplete or missing laudon et al 2017 the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water δ 18o and δ 2h as natural hydrological tracers provide useful additional information on water origin and transit time in the catchment and for disentangling surface and subsurface flows stets et al 2010 tetzlaff et al 2015 the utility of δ 18o and δ 2h relies on origin and seasonal variations in different hydrological compartments as follows i winter snow is more depleted in heavy isotopes 18o and 2h than summer rain due to low temperatures and reduced evaporation ii surface water exposed to evaporation becomes more enriched in heavy isotopes compared to the source and iii longer water transit time generally leads to isotopic averaging and lower variance and seasonal amplitudes of stable isotope proportions in runoff and groundwater compared to seasonally dependent precipitation mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 soulsby et al 2015 jasechko et al 2017 thus the stable isotopes of water can be used to determine lake water budgets gibson et al 2016a b and

2016 jung et al 2020 the aim of this study was to improve our understanding of hydrological pathways in relation to water quality in a small catchment by applying hydrochemical and stable isotopic tracers we selected the headwater mountain plešné lake catchment located in the natural park šumava at south west czechia in which the human activity is highly restricted small catchments 500 km2 are highly sensitive to environmental and anthropogenic impacts due to relatively rapid water and material cycles short hydrological pathways and more intensive groundwater surface water interaction thomas et al 2011 wagener et al 2007 moreover small headwater catchments with lakes are ideal observatories to study nutrients and other chemicals dynamics because they allow integral investigations of pathways from surface via soil and groundwater lakes serve as a cumulative pool of materials turnover and cycling while detailed hydrochemical studies in the catchment are available for more than a decade kopáček et al 2004 2017 2019 the relationship of chemistry to hydrological pathways water transit time contribution of seasonal precipitation to surface and subsurface water flows and contribution of subsurface inlet to the total lake water input are largely unknown previously vystavna et al 2018 we determined the isotopic response of the catchment in relation to its forest status and approximated evaporation transpiration and water transit time in forested versus deforested catchments based on 1 year of stable isotope monitoring we showed hydrological and hydrogeological features of the catchment play an important role in water and element distribution but our understanding of the links between water chemical composition and hydrological processes was insufficient to fully confirm this hypothesis vystavna et al 2018 here we fill this knowledge gap to answer questions on how the hydrological pathways in this small headwater catchment transform the chemical and isotopic signals derived from the precipitation the objectives of our study were to i describe hydrological hydrochemical and stable isotopic patterns of surface and subsurface flows and test whether these patterns differed among lake inlets ii use stable water isotopes and cl to estimate annual water balance of the lake and to compare the results of both approaches iii approximate the amount and location of the subsurface inlet contribution to the lake and iv to evaluate relations between water transit time and hydrochemistry of individual lake inlets the proposed approach can be suitable in other lake catchments to evaluate hydrological sensitivity to climatic land use and other changes 2 method and materials 2 1 site description the plešné lake catchment is situated in the boreal bohemian forest central europe 48 46 6 n 13 51 9 e 150 km southwest of prague the lake is a former glacial tarn with a surface level at 1090 m a s l with a surface area of 7 2 ha a maximum depth of 18 m and a volume of 0 553 million m3 of which 48 33 18 and 1 are at the depth layers of 0 5 5 10 10 15 and deeper than 15 m respectively lake water residence time is annually variable in a range of 0 5 to 1 3 years with a long term average of 0 9 year kopáček et al 2017 plešné lake usually stratifies during winter and summer periods kopáček et al 2019 the catchment area is 67 ha including the lake with a maximum relief of 288 m and average slope of 27 5 janský and šobr 2003 the soils of the catchment are sandy 75 and low in clay content 2 and include shallow leptosols 38 podsols 29 and dystric cambisols 27 with an average soil depth of 33 cm the remaining ground surface is bare rock 5 and wetland 1 kaňa et al 2014 the bedrock is composed of weathered two mica granite and granodiorite that have magnesium rich biotite sodium and calcium rich plagioclase potassium feldspar quartz with minor amounts of muscovite and biotite mica czech geological survey 2019 from a hydrogeological point of view the dominant bedrock type has low permeability plešné lake has two surface pl 1 and pl 2 and one subsurface pl 4 inlets fig 1 another inlet pl 3 was subsurface until 2001 and was exposed when the lake water level dropped by 0 5 m due to outlet re construction there are more boulders and scree in the sub catchments of pl 3 and pl 4 compared to more solid rock in the pl 1 and pl 2 sub catchments therefore subsurface flow is largely restricted to bedrock fissures as well as preferential flow in the thin 0 5 m weathered zone janský and šobr 2003 most 93 of the mature norway spruce forest that covered 90 of the catchment died during a bark beetle ips typographus infestation between 2004 and 2008 all dead forest biomass was left in the catchment to preserve natural conditions kopáček et al 2017 at present young forest is rapidly regenerating in the catchment water chemical composition in surface inlets pl 1 and pl 2 that changed during forest dieback have largely returned to pre infestation levels kopáček et al 2017 exceptions are dissolved organic carbon doc total organic nitrogen ton total phosphorus tp and dissolved reactive phosphorus drp their concentrations continue to rise or stabilize at their elevated levels after tree dieback due to increased availability of decomposing organic matter elevated soil moisture and lateral water flows through the uppermost organic rich soil horizons kopáček et al 2017 2018 2 2 meteorological and hydrological data the climate at plešné lake is cold with an average annual air temperature of 4 7 c and annual precipitation of 1300 mm the typical annual hydrological cycle is dominated by snowmelt which produces high discharge in streams during spring runoff vystavna et al 2018 snowpack accumulation usually starts in november with maximum snow accumulation in march the snowpack is fully melted by the end of april kopáček et al 2011 meteorological data from the nearby churáňov weather station was provided by the czech hydrometeorological institute precipitation amount was measured at three sites differing in elevation in the plešné catchment kopáček et al 2017 precipitation was collected at 2 week intervals using polyethylene collectors situated 1 5 2 m above the ground and protected from animals light and evaporation sample container was placed in a white insulated box connected to the collector via capillary tubing snow amount was measured at 2 to 4 week intervals using high density polyethylene cylinders situated 2 2 5 m above the ground outflow from the lake qout was monitored at 15 minute intervals using a calibrated weir and gauge recorder ms16 automatic weather station fiedler ams české budějovice discharge q in inlets was measured at the time of sampling at a 2 3 week intervals using a stopwatch and calibrated container at small natural waterfalls or rapids except for pl 4 subsurface spring whose discharge could not be measured annual evapotranspiration from the catchment and lake was estimated based on atmospheric water inputs to soils and on the lake surface discharge from the lake and mass balance of cl in the lake as described in detail in section 2 5 2 3 hydrochemical data 2 3 1 sampling and analysis precipitation samples in the catchment along with samples from the churáňov station water samples from lake inflows pl 1 pl 2 pl 3 and pl 4 and from the outflow pl o were collected from november 2016 to october 2018 i e during two hydrological years samples were collected near the inflow into the lake for pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 in a shallow well for pl 4 and at the lake outlet the lake water column depth profile was sampled at the deepest part of the lake at five different depths 0 5 4 8 12 and 16 m several times in 2017 water samples were pre filtered through a 200 µm polyethylene sieve for precipitation and through 40 µm polyamide filters for the rest of water samples and stored in the dark at 4 c until analysis chemical analysis was done in institute of hydrobiology biology centre of the academy of sciences of the czech republic major cations nh4 ca2 mg2 na and k and anions no3 cl so4 2 and f were analysed using ion chromatography dionex icf 3000

differences between concentrations of total and dissolved n forms and the sum of mineral n forms no3 and nh4 ph was measured by the gran titration the accuracy of the analytical results was controlled by balancing ionic charges including concentrations of organic acid anions and ionic aluminium and iron forms kopáček et al 2000 the differences between the sums of all cations and anions were 5 of the total ionic concentration in the individual water samples water temperature was measured onsite using thermometers 2 3 2 evaluation of water chemical composition we tested for differences in chemical and physical characteristics of surface and subsurface water flows with a tukey test significance level 0 05 for this purpose the geochemical data were tested for the normal distribution using the kolmogorov smirnov test and log transformed if necessary as described by vystavna et al 2017 the equivalent mol of charge concentrations of six major ions were plotted in modified stiff 1951 diagrams from annual volume weighed means using the r swmrgraphs package hem 1989 multivariate analysis was performed to test the hypothesis on statistically significant differences in hydrochemical variables between hydrological components precipitation surface and subsurface flows principal component analyses pca included individual samples of surface and subsurface flows the lake and the precipitation concentrations of ca2 and mg2 were highly correlated as were doc drp and tdp therefore ca2 drp and tdp were excluded from the pca to avoid distortions nitrate and silica were excluded from the pca because their concentrations were related to discharge which would confuse the desired spatial and seasonal effects with an event related patterns for pca we log x 1 transformed

calculated based on the activities of free ions in solution a mineral saturation index of 0 indicates equilibrium between mineral phase and the water while positive saturation index indicates supersaturation and negative saturation index reflects undersaturation 2 4 stable isotope data 2 4 1 sampling and analysis precipitation samples for stable isotopes were collected at the churáňov weather station id 11457 49 04 n 13 37 e 1118 m a s l daily precipitation was accumulated in a container for precipitation and combined for every calendar month the collection of precipitation was done according to the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip protocols of the international atomic energy agency iaea to guarantee the post collection integrity of the samples see isotopehydrologynetwork iaea org water samples for δ 18o and δ 2h analysis were collected from lake inlets and outlet simultaneously with samples for hydrochemical analysis water samples were transferred in 50 ml high density polyethylene bottles with screw caps and liners and stored at room temperature hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope analyses were conducted by cavity ringdown laser spectroscopy picarro l2120 i and l2130 i in the institute of hydrology slovak academy of sciences slovakia each sample was analysed at least twice using seven injections per vial and memory correction using the analytical protocol adapted from holko 2016 the results were referenced against internal laboratory standards calibrated against primary reference materials and reported in the δ values in

precision expressed as the one year variance of an internal control standard was better than 0 1 and 1 0 for δ 18o and δ 2h respectively nitrate isotope analysis was carried out by the denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 by converting nitrate to n2o an isotope ratio mass spectrometer gasbenchii delta v plus thermo fisher scientific usa was used for determination of δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 the results were compared with those for internal laboratory standards calibrated against primary reference materials and were expressed as relative to the standards air for δ 15n no3 and v smow for δ

water line lmwl n 24 was constructed using the reduced major axis regression method crawford et al 2014 the determined correlation equation was compared to the global meteoric water line described as δ 2h 8 δ 18o 10 craig 1961 the isotopic compositions of water flows were compared to the lmwl to examine relative variation and difference in isotopic composition of hydrological components deuterium excess d excess δ 2h 8 δ 18o was used as an indicator for non equilibrium conditions which occur during evaporation where water with d excess 10 was presumed to have undergone some evaporation dansgaard 1964 the mean water transit time in lake inflows was estimated according to herrmann and stichler 1981 1 τ r 1 f 2 1 2 π where τr is the water transit time in years and f is the ratio of the δ 18o amplitudes in the water flow b compared to the δ 18o amplitudes in precipitation a that was calculated for two years data series as 2 f b a the method was applied to approximate and compare the water transit time between lake inlets assuming that the isotopic lapse rate in precipitation was insignificant owing to the small differences in elevation between sub catchments vystavna et al 2018 a two component mixing model vystavna et al 2018 was used to estimate the contribution of precipitation from warm and cold seasonal periods based on annual flow weighted δ 18o value in lake inlets and

the lake δcll the annual average cl concentrations in four inlets clte were calculated as arithmetic means for individual inlets because the cl concentrations in all lake inlets were similar the δcll values were calculated as 4 δcll v c2 c1 where v m3 is lake volume and c1 and c2 both in mol m 3 are volume weighted mean in lake cl concentrations the c1 and c2 values were obtained from data on samples taken from five depths between the surface and bottom at the deepest part of the lake at the beginning 1 and the end 2 of each hydrological year respectively by linking volumes of the sampled water layers with the corresponding concentrations the net removal or production of cl within the lake was assumed to be negligible van der perk 2006 therefore the terrestrial water yield qte was calculated as 5 qte qout clout qpr clpr δcll clte taking into account that the lake is a flow through system of a headwater catchment we assumed that inflows originated from precipitation and that evaporation losses from the lake were compensated by inflows e g gibson et al 2016a b the hydrological steady state conditions in the lake observed during the mixing period and the isotopic mass

isotopic composition of the subsurface inflow pl 4 we assumed that old groundwater was not contributing into this headwater lake due to low permeability of the bedrock and based on previous evidence of the absence of a deeper aquifer in the plešné catchment vystavna et al 2018 additionally for the isotopic mass balance of the lake we approximated the δ l in several ways i using the well mixed conditions in autumn when all layers had the same delta values and ii using the volume weighted delta value of the lake outflow both methods showed identical delta values the standard deviation was 5 thus considering the focus on annual water balance eqs 6 and 9 we used the aw mean value estimated for the outflow 3 results 3 1 hydrometeorological conditions isotopic composition of precipitation lake inlets and outlet annual average air temperature and annual precipitation amounts differed between the two hydrological years with higher values in 2018 fig 2 table 1 during the study period the δ 18o values in monthly precipitation at the churáňov station varied from 6 1 to 15 0 δ 2h varied from 41 0 to 110 2 and d excess was from 5 2 to 16 fig 2 the aw mean of δ 18o in precipitation was 10

the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes were correlated with air temperature positively and with relative humidity negatively however no significant correlation was found with precipitation amount the correlation with temperature was low for november 2016 and december 2017 which were months with low δ 18o 14 1 and 15 respectively and δ 2h 100 3 and 108 5 respectively values we modelled the trajectories of air masses delivering moisture to the site during these two months and have found that most resulting in 70 of precipitation amount at the churáňov station originated from the north atlantic thus being imprinted with the low isotopic ratios of the moisture source fig s1 in supplementary information isotopic values of the inlets and outlet of the lake were within the range of precipitation the stable isotopes in surface and subsurface flows were slightly above the lmwl fig 3 a with more depleted aw mean of δ 18o 10 8 over the entire two year survey compared to the pl 1 and pl 2 inlets pl 3 had lower aw mean of δ 18o 11 1 and pl 4 was even more negative 11 3 isotopic values of the pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 inlets were well distributed along the churáňov lmwl but those of the subsurface inlet pl 4 were less variable fig 3a the aw mean of δ 18o in the lake outflow was 9 2 the regression line of the lake outflow fig 3a represented the local evaporation line lel with a slope of 5 2 and an interception point below the aw mean of the churáňov precipitation but was close to the aw mean of δ 18o value for pl 3 the amplitude of δ 18o in inlets were decreasing from pl 1 to pl 4 fig 3b the calculated water transit time in pl 1 pl 2 pl 3 and pl 4 were 5 5 7 and 11 months respectively water transit time in the lake was estimated at 9 5 months as calculated using a two component mixing model the contribution of the warm season precipitation to the recharge of surface and subsurface flows was 45 for pl 1 and pl 2 38 for pl 3 and 30 for pl 4 without a significant p 0 05 inter annual difference 3 2 hydrochemical composition and stable isotopes of nitrate in lake inlets and outlet the average water ph in lake inflows pl 1 pl 2 pl 3 and pl 4 was 4 3 4 4 4 6 and 4 9 respectively the lake outflow had a higher ph of 5 4 water temperature varied seasonally in pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 with the range between 0 7 and 11 6 c but was relatively constant in pl 4 with values 4 8 c table s1 in supplementary information in the stiff type plot fig 4 a and b pl 1 and pl 2 exhibited similar major ion compositions pl 3 had higher so4 2 ca2 and no3 concentrations the subsurface pl 4 had the highest so4 2 mg2 ca2 and no3 concentrations among all lake inflows on the first pca plot fig 5 a the values representing precipitation turquoise did not overlap with any other values and were far from inflow samples along the first component which explained 65 of the variation axis x along the second component 18 of the variance the largely overlapping values of pl 1 and pl 2 were separate from pl 3 and pl 4 precipitation samples were characterized by high nh4 and bicarbonate the nh4 and bicarbonate loadings plotted in the vicinity of the samples from precipitation geogenic ions such as na k mg2 but also so4 2 which in the catchment still derives from atmospheric deposition originally deposited in the soil and now continuously released majer et al 2003 had high positive loadings on the first component characterizing lake inflow samples the loadings of f and mg2 ca2 plotted furthest up in the plot next to the samples from pl 4 indicating that pl 4 was characterized by higher concentrations of these elements in contrast pl 4 was low in proton concentrations expressed by high ph values the tp and doc concentrations were at the opposite end of the second component thus negatively correlated to ph f and mg2 ca2 but characteristic for pl 1 and pl 2 tributaries fig 5a since precipitation was distinctive from the lake inflows in a second pca we excluded precipitation fig 5b the four lake inlets were separated along the first component 48 of variances the overlapping pl 1 and pl 2 samples were clearly separated from pl 3 and pl 4 samples here again pl 1 and pl 2 were characterized by high doc and tp mg2 ca2 and f were at the opposite end of the first component and negatively correlated with doc and tp the pl 3 samples were between the pl 4 and overlapping pl 1 and pl 2 samples displaying properties of both surface and subsurface flows while the first component explained the spatial separation the second component could be a temporal dimension since cold colours i e samples from cold months plotted to the bottom and samples with warm colours were characterized by high temperature at the top of the plot as typical for the warm months the multivariate inter annual differences adonis r2 0 01 p 0 8 in physical and chemical variables were not significant but the differences between inlets and precipitation were significant adonis r2 0 80 p 0 001 the post hoc test revealed significant differences in physical and chemical variables for all pairs of inlets and precipitation pairwiseadonis r2 between 0 41 and 0 81 adjusted p 0 01 except for the pair pl 1 and pl 2 pairwiseadonis r2 0 08 adjusted p 0 38 results of phreeqc modelling showed that all four inlets were supersaturated the saturation index was 0 with respect to goethite feooh hematite fe2o3 and talc mg3si4o10 oh 2 this model also showed that pl 1 and pl 2 were saturated with respect to quartz sio2 and pl 3 and pl 4 were saturated with chrysotile mg3si2o5 oh 4 in the lake inlets no3 concentrations increased by a factor of three from pl 1 to pl 4 fig 4a and b in the lake outlet the no3 concentration was lowest 0 001 mg l 1 n the δ 15n νο3 value was higher in pl 1 and pl 2 2 3 and 3 8 respectively and lower in pl o pl 3 and pl 4 0 7 0 2 and 1 7 respectively fig 6 the δ 18o νο3 value of the lake outflow was higher 30 than in the lake inflows from 5 5 to 10 4 stable n and o isotopes of no3 in samples were within the range reported in kendall 1998 for no3 originating from a mixture of 18o enriched atmospheric deposition pl o nitrification of nh4 in the soil pl 1 and pl 2 and nh4 deposited with precipitation pl 3 and pl 4 compared to other inlets pl 4 had not only lower δ 15n no3 values but also lower δ 18o no3 isotopic values of pl 1 and pl 2 plotted along a 2 1 denitrification line fig 6 3 3 water balances and lake stratification the two hydrological years were slightly different in terms of water balance components the precipitation amount water fluxes and outflow from the lake were 20 higher water residence time in the lake was 20 lower and evapotranspiration was 10 lower in 2018 than in 2017 table 1 for this study we used δ 18o for isotope mass balance due to the strong correlation between h and o isotopes water yields from the catchment estimated using the isotope and cl mass balances were similar table 1 the calculated evaporation inflow ratio e i of the lake was 7 in each year the estimated annual subsurface contribution into the lake was 52 and 55 of the total water inputs to the lake in 2017 and 2018 respectively table 1 the temperature profile suggested that the lake completely mixed in october 2016 fig 7 this was corroborated by the δ 18o values which were vertically homogeneous 8 9 and only slightly higher compared to the δ 18o aw mean of the lake outflow during the ice on period that lasted from late november to april water temperature was 2 c near the surface and 4 c in the deeper layers the δ 18o aw values decreased in the surface layer and in the depth of 8 m at the end of january 2017 and further at the bottom at the end of february 2017 in mid march 2017 the layers from 4 to 12 m had a similar δ 18o composition 9 1 and the δ 18o depletion was observed only in the surface layer 10 0 and at the bottom 9 6 during the ice off period the hypolimnion water temperature was 5 c from the bottom to the depth of 8 m and rapidly increased to 20 c at the thermocline in the depth of 3 4 m during the period of intensive evaporation that occurred in june august the δ 18o values were 8 2 at the lake surface but at the depths from 4 to 12 m were homogenous and indicated a depletion in 18o 10 1 with a small deviation at the bottom 10 3 at the beginning of september 2017 the lake surface was even more 18o enriched 8 0 fig 7 as shown in the box whiskers plot fig 8 the deeper layers of the lake had lower values of δ 18o than water at depths of 0 5 m and 4 m the δ 18o composition in the lake outflow showed variations like those at the lake surface fig 8 4 discussion comparing stable water isotopes in inflows and the lake we found that isotopic signatures of surface and subsurface water fell within the range of those measured in precipitation fig 3a however the variations of isotope values were different amongst hydrological components fig 3b stable water isotopes in precipitation at the churáňov station displayed strong seasonal variation with more negative values in winter and higher values in summer fig 2 typical for continental climate dansgaard 1964 as expected seasonal isotopic variation was largely dampened in the lake inflows compared to precipitation as shown by the less scattered distribution of isotopic data in pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 and even lower scatter in the subsurface pl 4 fig 3a and b the isotope based calculation revealed that water transit times in pl 1 and pl 2 5 months were only about half of that in subsurface pl 4 11 months the lake inflow pl 3 was intermediate between surface and subsurface inflows with water transit time of 7 months the more depleted isotopic values in pl 4 suggested that this subsurface inflow was dominantly recharged by the seasonal snowmelt tetzlaff et al 2015 this was confirmed by the results of two component mixing model which showed a dominant contribution of the cold season precipitation to pl 4 the difference in the water transit times among the four inflows can be explained by specific hydrological conditions within the catchment vertical drainage in the freely draining soil layer recharges subsurface flow however the soil cover in the catchment is usually thin at some areas within the catchment the bedrock consists of fractured granite such fractured rocks are known to receive drained water from deeper stores which increases water residence time and likely explains the decreased seasonal variation of δ 18o signature observed in pl 4 these stores can be variable in size distribution and hydraulic properties soulsby et al 2000 surface lake inflows pl 1 and pl 2 showed a seasonally varying δ 18o that evolved during the year in response to precipitation inputs indicating water with a shorter transit time or young water soulsby et al 2000 may dominate in these tributaries however to confirm this interpretation a longer period of isotopic observations is recommended the difference in water transit time between lake inflows was an important determinant of the water chemical composition stiff plots and pca clearly separated precipitation from lake inflows figs 4a b and 5a and clearly separated pl 4 and pl 3 with the longer transit time from the surface hydrological pathways figs 4a b and 5b water chemical composition in the surface inlets pl 1 and pl 2 varied widely particularly along the second component in the fig 5b indicating strong seasonality and reflecting short residence times which points to mixing of different water sources at different times the high ton tp and doc concentrations characterizing the surface tributaries pl 1 and pl 2 were related to shallower soils in their sub catchments and to more frequent lateral flows and elevated biomass degradation after tree dieback kaňa et al 2015 kopáček et al 2017 oulehle et al 2019 these water components do not usually reach deeper soils or bedrock fractures since they are either degraded or adsorbed to the soil matrix over time the more frequent lateral flows due to elevated soil moisture after tree dieback kopáček et al 2018 further shortened the naturally short water residence time in these sub catchments decreased the effect of weathering and increased the role of biomass degradation on ionic and nutrient composition of the inlets pl 1 and pl 2 due to the extended water transit time in pl 3 and pl 4 water has longer contact with the rocks this might lead to their oversaturation with geogenic ions found by the phreeqc simulations mg2 and ca2 interaction mainly with weathered rock materials but less with the soil could explain why these geogenic ions dominated water composition of pl 4 while its doc and tp concentrations were low the higher concentration of so4 2 for lake inflows compared to the precipitation was explained by sulphur forms accumulated in soils from elevated atmospheric deposition during the last century and microbially oxidization to so4 2 oulehle et al 2019 however geogenic sulphate can be formed from s bearing minerals in soil and rocks this required additional study with the application of the stable isotopes of so4 2 to help differentiate biogenic and geogenic sulphates in tributaries jezierski et al 2006 according to the result of the phreeqc model it was suggested that poorly soluble minerals of the serpentine group like chrysotile could occur in tributaries with a longer residence time pl 3 and pl 4 however the presence of these minerals in the fractured granite needs to be verified by mineralogical analysis kuzvart 1984 the extended residence time and dominance of weathering with little inputs from the surface were further indicated by the low temporal variation of water chemistry in pl 4 the results of nitrate isotope analyses added another layer of complexity to the interpretations based only on water isotopes and hydrochemical concentrations despite the small number of nitrate isotope samples composition of inflows reflected different sources and biogeochemical processes as shown by their unique δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values in the dual δ 15n no3 vs δ 18o no3 relationship fig 6 according to kendall 1998 and kendall et al 2008 pl 1 and pl 2 exhibited 18o to 15n in nitrate representative for the soil passage the nitrate isotope data of pl 3 and pl 4 in contrast fell into the source window of nh4 in precipitation and fertilizers kendall 1998 however given that no fertilizers or other chemicals are applied in this area these two samples likely represent the nh4 precipitation signal the δ 15n no3 vs δ 18o no3 relation in nitrate in pl 3 and even more so in pl 4 was indeed characteristic of the signature found for ammonium in precipitation kendall 1998 kendall et al 2008 we suggest that nitrate isotope patterns at sites pl 3 and pl 4 indicate that recharge with precipitation presumably accumulated in subsurface storage over a longer time than in pl 1 and pl 2 the nitrate found in pl 1 and pl 2 probably did not reach pl 3 and pl 4 due to its longer residence time in their sub catchments allowing larger extent of its assimilation or denitrification in soils the isotope results further indicate that the sites received different proportions of nitrate derived from nitrification of soil organic nitrogen and atmospheric nh4 as can be seen from the signals not overlapping in fig 6 the atmospheric nitrate deposition in central european precipitation usually had more enriched 18o value of between 50 and 80 i matiatos iaea personal communication the lake outflow showed a mixture of no3 originating from 18o enriched nitrate in precipitation and 18o depleted in lake inflows such as in the samples pl 3 and pl 4 the reason for the difference in δ 15n no3 values between pl 3 and pl 4 might be caused by different microbial and physical conditions in their sub catchments manifested e g by different ph and doc serca et al 1994 although the number of sites is limited we could assume isotope fractionation of δ 15n no3 driven by the mineralization of organic matter which is present in the soil thus the soil may represent a significant nitrogen source kendall et al 2008 for the surface inlets even though based on a limited set of data the observed between inlet differences in isotopic nitrate composition suggest that hydrological pathways are important determinants of the nitrate mixing and distribution in the plešné catchment distinct cl concentrations in precipitation lake inflows and outflow allowed us to evaluate the water balance of the lake table 1 however the negligible differences in cl concentrations between surface and subsurface flows made it impossible to fully estimate their relative contribution to the lake instead δ 18o with distinct values among surface and subsurface flows was used for this purpose while isotope mass balance method are also affected by uncertainties associated with assumptions of steady state conditions isokangas et al 2015 results on the catchment water yield and lake water residence time provided by both δ 18o and cl balances were in reasonable agreement table 1 the catchment water yield based on the δ 18o balance was 10 and 4 higher than that provided by the cl balance in 2017 and 2018 respectively small deviations 9 lower in 2017 and 3 higher in 2018 were also found for the δ 18o based lake water residence times compared to those based on the cl balance the δ 18o balance showed that total subsurface flow represented about a half of the catchment water yield similarly to many boreal forest lakes in finland and canada turner et al 2010 isokangas et al 2015 gibson et al 2016a b contribution of the subsurface flow was also traced in the isotopic stratification in the lake figs 7a b and 8 during the period of the thermal stratification more depleted isotopic composition of water at the depth of 8 m and its lower seasonal variation indicated deep inflows of water with a longer residence time than in the surface inlets another deep inflow of subsurface water likely occurred to the bottom layer fig 8 the occurrence of the subsurface inflows at the different depths can be explained by different degree of bedrock fracturing in the individual sub catchments the steep plešné catchment has been affected by rock avalanches janský and šobr 2003 we assume that more big boulders and fragmented rocks are below soils in the southeast part of the lake wall i e in the sub catchment of pl 4 on fig 1 than in the rest of the catchment this could additionally explain the longer transit time of water in the pl 4 inlet and significant portion of subsurface deep water inflows to the lake similar conditions were also described elsewhere for catchments with weathered granite bedrock e g soulsby et al 2000 5 conclusions based on the results derived from the application of multi tracer approach we concluded that flows in the plešné catchment were more complex than initially anticipated and suggested a diverse set of subsurface flow patterns leading to inlets into the lake we found that chemical and isotopic compositions of surface and subsurface inlets were correlated to differences in water transit time and degree of interaction with soil and rock materials our results showed that even at the smaller scale and within a year variation water transit time was found to be an important determinant of hydrochemical characteristics by prolonging the interaction of hydrological pathways with weathered rock materials additionally water flow redistribution due to geological setting played an important role in elements transport interfering the relative importance of hydrological pathways at the catchment and sub catchment scales as traced by isotopic and chemical parameters while we sampled obvious inflows it is also possible that other subsurface inflows contribute to the lake they might account for some of the variability in the lake stratification isotope signals which we could not fully explain by the contributions of these four inlets credit authorship contribution statement y vystavna conceptualization methodology writing original draft s i schmidt formal

5583,there exist very few reviews of models that predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management e g clearcutting and thinning this omission has potentially prevented forest hydrologists from effectively identifying critical research topics and collaborating with policymakers practitioners and researchers in related fields to assist policymaking to remedy this omission the current study elaborates why models were needed in the first place and how models were developed historically models were developed to overcome limitations of traditional meta analyses of measurement studies i e inability to explain between site variations in evapotranspiration changes with forest management that had been recognized since the 1960s with the improvement of the understandings about evapotranspiration processes forest hydrologists proposed models that could predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management around 1990 among the models proposed around 1990 models for large scales were widely used for practical purposes e g assessing the impact of large scale deforestation on the continental and global water cycle however models for small scales were not widely used for assessing the impacts of forest management on water resources and other practical purposes one major reason for this was that models for small scales proposed around 1990 were primarily designed as research tools to improve practical applicability forest hydrologists then started developing simple practical models for small scales that focused on applications to a particular area species and purpose around 2000 considering the necessity of human society to adapt to emerging environmental challenges within a limited time frame we conclude that the primary role of forest hydrologists in this era is to quickly detect emerging environmental challenges and then develop practical models for connecting different stakeholders for collective decision making this paper also suggests that the use of practical models can be a starting point to rearticulate the role of forest hydrologists in policymaking keywords adaptation climate change decision making ecosystem resilience evaporation water management 1 introduction forest management e g clearcutting and thinning changes forest structure and then changes water carbon and nutrient cycles in forest ecosystems among changes in various components of water carbon and nutrient cycles examining changes in evapotranspiration is particularly important one major reason is that evapotranspiration is altered directly by changes in forest structure induced by forest management changes in evapotranspiration then lead to changes in other components including water runoff photosynthesis and nutrient leaching landsberg and gower 1997 waring and running 1998 ellison et al 2017 examining changes in evapotranspiration with forest management is thus one starting point for comprehensively understanding changes in water carbon and nutrient cycles induced by forest management in addition examining changes in evapotranspiration with forest management is important from a practical viewpoint evapotranspiration affects water runoff from forested catchments and then water resources available for humans calder et al 2003 komatsu et al 2008 2012a sun et al 2017 researchers have been conducting studies measuring changes in annual runoff which approximate changes in annual evapotranspiration with forest management e g cornish 1993 stoneman 1993 lane and mackay 2001 results of such measurement studies have been then reviewed to understand similarity and differences between studies sites e g bosch and hewlett 1982 kuraji 2003 andréassian 2004 brown et al 2005 more importantly researchers have developed models that predict changes in evapotranspiration and runoff with forest management e g granier et al 1999 vertessy et al 2001 calder 2003 komatsu et al 2007a 2015 such models are particularly important in the current context because forest management is deemed as potential measures to counter environmental challenges human society is currently facing for example climate change e g changes in rainfall regime and evaporative demand has been damaging forest ecosystems through plant water relations and exacerbating water shortages in many regions bréda and badeau 2008 de cáceres et al 2015 keenan 2015 forest management e g thinning is proposed as potential measures to alleviate forest damages and water shortages vose et al 2011 grant et al 2013 kerhoulas et al 2013 sun and vose 2016 vilà cabrera et al 2018 to examine the effectiveness of forest management for such purposes it is necessary to assess potential changes in evapotranspiration and catchment runoff with forest management despite the importance of assessing changes in evapotranspiration with forest management very few papers have reviewed models that predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management this contrasts with the presence of many papers that review observed changes in annual runoff with forest management bosch and hewlett 1982 sahin and hall 1996 andréassian 2004 brown et al 2005 iida et al 2019 this omission has potentially prevented forest hydrologists from effectively identifying critical research topics in modeling and collaborating with policymakers practitioners e g forest and water managers and researchers in related fields e g ecology civil engineering and adaptation science for the adaptation of human society to emerging environmental challenges the current study reviews models that predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management this review paper elaborates why models were needed in the first place and how models were developed historically this elaboration allows forest hydrologists to consciously grasp the historical contexts of modeling evapotranspiration changes with forest management at the same time this elaboration provides basic information for non specialists policymakers practitioners and researchers in related fields to promote collaboration with forest hydrologists this review then discusses the role of forest hydrologists under the current context and finally contemplate how forest hydrologists potentially contribute to the adaption of human society to environmental challenges in this century 2 why models were needed there exist numerous measurement studies that examined changes in evapotranspiration or runoff which approximates the difference between rainfall and evapotranspiration with forest management in addition several studies conducted meta analyses of these measurement studies besides measurement studies and meta analyses why did forest hydrologists need to model changes in evapotranspiration the primary reason was that through previous measurement studies and meta analyses researchers recognized that variations in the results among different studies sites could not be explained easily without considering underlying processes modeling was one way to consider underlying processes as early as in the 1960s the difficulty in explaining variations in the results among different studies sites began to be recognized one classic meta analytic study hibbert 1967 collated changes in annual runoff with reduction in forest cover by various forest management practices from 39 measurement studies and found large variations in annual runoff increase among studies hibbert 1967 on one hand observed a consistent trend among studies sites that reduction in forest cover in a catchment increased annual runoff hibbert 1967 on the other hand highlighted large unexplained variations in annual runoff changes among studies sites concerning these unexplained variations hibbert 1967 p 535 stated that the magnitude of treatment response varied considerably complete cutting and burning of scrub aspen forest high in the colorado rockies caused streamflow to increase only 34 mm during the first year after cutting whereas in the mountains of east africa complete cutting and removal of high bamboo forest increased water yield by 457 mm these extreme examples reflect the diverse nature of the results and hint at the complexity of the causative factors as hibbert 1967 stated unexplained variations in annual runoff increase often reached several hundred millimeters in another place of the same paper hibbert 1967 stated that variations among studies were highly variable and for the most part unpredictable p 535 italics added despite the repetition of similar meta analyses using more extensive datasets by succeeding studies most parts of variations among studies sites have remained unexplained bosch and hewlett 1982 sahin and hall 1996 stednick 1996 andréassian 2004 brown et al 2005 adams and fowler 2006 komatsu et al 2011a zhang et al 2017 for example andréassian 2004 obtained qualitatively the same results as those of hibbert 1967 and stated that the results are extremely scattered as already observed by hibbert 1967 p 11 according to andréassian s 2004 meta analysis several studies observed virtually no increase in annual runoff with deforestation of the whole experimental catchment while several other studies observed a more than 600 mm increase in annual runoff fig 1 such large variations among different studies sites suggest that these traditional meta analyses are not very useful for providing implications for practical forest management strategies and policymaking komatsu et al 2007b komatsu 2010 in addition to the case for forest cover reduction many studies reported inconsistent results among different catchments with species conversion swank and douglass 1974 reported a decrease in annual runoff with converting broadleaf forests to coniferous plantations suggesting higher annual evapotranspiration for coniferous plantations than broadleaf forests although several studies also reported higher annual evapotranspiration for coniferous plantations than broadleaf forests cannell 1999 calder et al 2003 nisbet 2005 komatsu et al 2008 other studies reported comparable annual evapotranspiration between coniferous plantations and broadleaf forests dons 1987 fahey and jackson 1997 pizarro et al 2006 komatsu et al 2007a 2009 2011a these results also underline the difficulty in explaining changes in annual runoff and evapotranspiration with forest management by traditional meta analyses another practical problem of traditional meta analyses is that it does not consider variations in forest management methods bosch and hewlett 1982 did not distinguish for example the following two cases 1 selective thinning of the whole catchment by 30 of the total basal area and 2 clearcutting of a 30 area of the catchment such inability of considering variations in forest management methods also suggests one limitation of traditional meta analyses although the purposes of using models are numerous one major purpose is to overcome the limitations of measurement studies and traditional meta analyses models consider not only the input i e forest management and output i e annual evapotranspiration and runoff but processes between the input and output more specifically models calculate various components of evapotranspiration i e tree transpiration rainfall interception and forest floor evapotranspiration at a short time scale e g daily time scale which potentially leads to comprehensive understandings of variations in annual runoff changes among studies sites 3 understandings of evapotranspiration were improved during 1970 1990 it was around 1990 when many models that could predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management were proposed fig 2 such models had been rarely proposed for approximately 20 years since hibbert s 1967 meta analytic study these 20 years i e the 1970s and 1980s were not spent in determining the general direction of modeling from the outset forest hydrologists largely shared one clear direction forest hydrologists had consistently tried to develop a model that considered underlying physical processes in the introduction of a seminal paper published in 1973 stewart and thom 1973 declared the necessity of process based understanding and modeling of evapotranspiration some empirical methods do exist for obtaining actual evaporation from potential evaporation however we must turn to the penman equation itself in the form which describes the evaporation from an unsaturated surface to find a physically sound description of the problem p 154 italics added similarly we find many studies that attempted to analyze evapotranspiration data based on the physical theory of evapotranspiration i e the penman monteith equation around 1970 waggoner and reifsnyder 1968 waggoner et al 1969 rutter et al 1971 1975 mcnaughton and black 1973 stewart and thom 1973 this strong commitment to process based understanding and modeling might be partly because forest hydrologists had witnessed a success in modeling crop and grassland evapotranspiration by agronomists using the penman monteith equation in the 1960s monteith et al 1965 van bavel 1967 szeicz and long 1969 despite this strong commitment to the development of process based models it took approximately 20 years for forest hydrologists to develop process based models that can be used to assess changes in evapotranspiration with forest management during the 20 years forest hydrologists needed to overcome several difficulties described below one difficulty was technical to examine applicability of evapotranspiration theory to forest evapotranspiration forest hydrologists needed unprecedentedly large facilities including measurement towers to access the above canopy atmosphere e g stewart and thom 1973 shuttleworth et al 1984 measurement towers to access forest canopies were essential to obtain evapotranspiration data at a short time scale e g an hourly scale using micrometeorological methods additionally forest evapotranspiration should be ideally observed across seasons evapotranspiration from forests often continues in winter e g shuttleworth and calder 1979 humphreys et al 2003 and even in dry seasons e g tanaka et al 2003 kume et al 2007 this contrasts with many crops of which evapotranspiration occurs mainly in growing seasons another difficulty was scientific even if evapotranspiration data for various forest sites become available parameterization of forest evapotranspiration is not easy one major reason is that forest evapotranspiration is regulated strongly by biological processes rather than physical processes mcnaughton and black 1973 mcnaughton and jarvis 1983 jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 more specifically forest evapotranspiration is regulated mainly by stomatal aperture rather than aerodynamic diffusion of water vapor from leaves to the atmosphere this contrasts with evapotranspiration from crops in which biological processes play relatively a minor role consequently forest evapotranspiration is highly sensitive to parameters representing biological processes such as surface canopy conductance in the penman monteith equation however parameterization of biological processes is much more difficult than that of physical processes unlike physical processes shaw and pereira 1982 raupach 1994 biological processes are not always strongly related to structural properties of forests oren et al 1999 modeling of biological processes was so difficult during 1970 1990 that several forest hydrologists modeled biological processes using a function of time without considering any internal processes calder 1977 rampisela et al 1990 this difficulty in modeling biological processes made parameterization of evapotranspiration from dry forest canopies much more difficult than that from wet forest canopies i e interception evaporation which is unrelated to biological processes rutter et al 1971 gash 1979 this difficulty in modeling biological processes was gradually relaxed first by developing empirical relationships between the biological processes and meteorological factors jarvis 1976 lindroth 1985 and then by interpreting the empirical relationships using the hydraulic theory of stomata regulation oren et al 1999 2001 4 models began to be proposed around 1990 it was around 1990 when models that can predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management e g thinning pruning and harvesting and other large scale land use changes e g deforestation and urbanization began to be proposed around this period the difficulties explained above had been largely overcome more specifically applicability of evapotranspiration theory i e the penman monteith equation to forest evapotranspiration was confirmed by measurement studies in the 1970s and 1980s mcnaughton and black 1973 gash and stewart 1975 tan and black 1976 milne 1979 verma et al 1986 at the same time year round evapotranspiration data began to be reported e g shuttleworth and calder 1979 stewart 1988 and methods for parameterizing biological processes advanced lindroth 1985 gash et al 1989 these advances in research prepared the theoretical and methodological ground to develop models that could predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management fig 2 models proposed around 1990 varied according to the target spatial scales table 1 models like sechiba bats sib and others i e models for large scales mainly aimed to assess changes in water carbon and nutrient cycles with global and continental land use changes e g amazonian deforestation in contrast models like forest bgc shetran biomass maestro and others i e models for small scales mainly aimed to assess changes in water carbon and nutrient cycles with more nuanced forest management practices e g thinning and harvesting at smaller scales e g stand catchment and regional scales note that models proposed around 1990 did not exclusively aim to predict changes in evapotranspiration and the water cycle with forest management for example biomass focused more on predicting the forest carbon cycle rather than the water cycle still such models can be used to predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management models for large scales have been widely used since they were proposed e g gao et al 2010 whereas models for small scales have been rarely used for example it is easy to find papers using the swat model for practical purposes such as proposing water resource management e g baker and miller 2013 zhou et al 2013 indeed the number of citable documents including swat model arnold the name of one representative model developer and water resources increased from 163 in the 1990s to 10 000 in the 2010s according to google scholar this contrasts with the case for forest bgc although forest bgc is similar to the swat model in the complexity of the evapotranspiration routine very few papers use forest bgc model for proposing water resource management the number of citable documents including forest bgc model running i e the name of one representative model developer and water resources increased from 89 in the 1990s only to 148 in the 2010s it is true that one derivative of forest bgc i e biome bgc has been widely used for practical purposes however biome bgc has been mainly used at regional continental and global scales e g gordon and famiglietti 2004 milesi et al 2005 mu et al 2007 when biome bgc is used at smaller scales it is usually used as research tools rather than application tools kimball et al 1997 ueyama et al 2010 see the discussion in the next section it is somewhat surprising that models for small scales were rarely used for practical purposes because many models for small scales were designed to allow wide applications indeed researchers provided default model parameters for applications not only at experimental sites but in regions where measurement data were unavailable e g waring and running 1998 several researchers even distributed the source code of the model e g waring and running 1998 medlyn 2004 these models thus contrasted with models developed in the 1980s that were designed for understanding the water cycle at a particular experimental site spittlehouse and black 1981 kelliher et al 1986 more importantly many models proposed around 1990 tended to use process based equations rather than empirical equations to guarantee the applicability of the models to a place where measurements were unavailable in terms of the evapotranspiration submodel most models e g forest bgc shetran biomass and maestro used the penman monteith equation in addition biomass divided the forest canopy vertically into several layers to calculate the vertical distribution of evapotranspiration maestro even considered three dimensional distribution of trees in a forest and calculated evapotranspiration for each tree this strong commitment to process based modeling might be partly due to the response of the academic community to climate change around 1990 climate change was recognized as a major environmental challenge for human society e g spielman 1989 ipcc 1990 1995 see also houghton 2015 to predict responses of forests to untested conditions e g under warmer climate researchers used process based equations rather than empirical equations developed in the past and current conditions ryan et al 1996a b landsberg and gower 1997 tian et al 1998 komatsu and hashimoto 2002 5 problems of the models for small scales proposed around 1990 most models for small scales proposed around 1990 were not widely used for practical purposes e g assessing the impacts of forest management on water resources despite the intention of model developers many researchers suggested that the primary reason was that the models were developed from the viewpoint of researchers landsberg and waring 1998 battaglia and sands 1998 mäkelä et al 2000 sands 2001 tickle et al 2001 landsberg 2003 for example landsberg and waring 1998 p 210 state all these models however are essentially research tools and have yet to be simplified to the point where they are of value or indeed of interest to practical forest managers this statement is corroborated by our finding in table 1 models for small scales are often used for understanding phenomena observed at experimental sites rather than conducting assessments for supporting policymaking what prevented the models for small scales from being used for practical purposes we find at least four main factors first the structure of the models was too complex for example forest bgc calculates not only the water cycle but carbon and nutrient cycles this comprehensive nature allows forest bgc to be potentially used for various purposes however policymakers and practitioners who have a specific purpose might find this comprehensive nature as redundant second the models usually need adjustments of default parameter values many studies using default parameter values found a considerable discrepancy between model predictions and observations e g cienciala et al 1998 hingston et al 1998 chiesi et al 2002 hoff and joffre 2002 these discrepancy suggests the necessity of adjusting default parameter values when applying the model to a certain place these results were supported by the results of meta analytic studies wilson et al 2002 komatsu 2003 2005 komatsu et al 2012b see also ewers et al 2011 these meta analytic studies collating evapotranspiration data derived from micrometeorological and sap flux methods found large variations in key parameters e g surface conductance for evapotranspiration among different sites surface conductance data for 34 coniferous forest sites collated by komatsu 2003 ranged between 3 mm s 1 and 20 mm s 1 fig 3 a this suggests that evapotranspiration rates for one coniferous forest can be more than six times of those for another coniferous forest when assuming a full coupling between the canopy and the atmosphere the mean and standard deviation of surface conductance for the 34 coniferous forest sites were 10 2 and 4 4 mm s 1 the range in which 95 of surface conductance data falls will be thus between 1 4 and 19 0 mm s 1 if we assume a normal distribution of data the upper end of the range is thus approximately 14 times of the lower end these large variations in surface conductance and other equivalent parameters were not sufficiently explained by the variations in the leaf area index among sites fig 3b although models e g running and coughlan 1988 mcmurtrie et al 1990a b 1992b running and gower 1991 often considered the leaf area index for modeling evapotranspiration see ichihashi et al 2015 2019 for related discussions although canopy height explains some of the variations in evapotranspiration among different forest sites across the world komatsu 2003 2004 2005 its explanatory power is still too low e g irvine et al 2002 2004 kumagai et al 2007 2008 komatsu et al 2014 kume et al 2016 tsuruta et al 2019 we surmise that researchers who realized this difficulty in explaining variations in evapotranspiration among different forest sites were reluctant to apply models for small scales e g forest bgc shetran biomass and maestro to their own target area such variations in evapotranspiration among forest sites would not be a major problem for models for large scales models for large scales are usually used to assess changes in the water cycle with a drastic change such as deforestation and urbanization table 1 these models are thus expected to distinguish evapotranspiration between drastically different land uses e g between forests and grasslands which is easier than to distinguish evapotranspiration between forests with different species and management history kelliher et al 1993 1995 schulze et al 1994 furthermore models for large scales often consider the planetary boundary feedback and therefore model predictions are less sensitive to evapotranspiration parameters such as surface conductance mcnaughton 1989 mcnaughton and jarvis 1991 third the models included too many parameters this is a consequence of that the models considered various processes of water carbon and nutrient cycles as described above model users often find a discrepancy between predictions and observations and therefore they need to determine parameters for themselves in actuality this determination of model parameters is generally difficult one major reason is that the models include various processes and therefore model parameterization requires data for various components of water carbon and nutrient cycles if such data are unavailable model users cannot find a way to reasonably determine model parameters even if model users find a parameter set that gives a good fit between calculations and observations there will be potentially other parameter sets that give comparably good fits due to the high degree of freedom see beven 2000 beven and freer 2001 fourth many models for small scales proposed around 1990 did not use parameters traditionally used for forest management e g diameter of breast height basal area and stem density model users could rarely use existing traditional data as model inputs and validation data for model outputs despite the availability of traditional data at small scales this contrasts with the case for models for large scales at large scales the inability of using traditional data was not problematic global scale datasets for traditional parameters e g diameter of breast height basal area and stem density were virtually unavailable many models for large scales rather use data derived from remote sensing e g cleugh et al 2007 mu et al 2007 marshall et al 2013 6 practical models for small scales began to be proposed around 2000 as the problems of the models for small scales proposed around 1990 were widely recognized researchers began to propose more practical models for small scales e g stand catchment and regional scales around 2000 landsberg and waring 1998 sun et al 1998a b granier et al 1999 calder 2003 calder et al 2003 komatsu et al 2007a 2015 fig 2 using these models researchers also started assessing the impact of actual forest and water management issues table 2 for example calder et al 2003 assessed the impact of afforestation proposed by the united kingdom government on water resources komatsu et al 2007a evaluated the impact of forest species conversion occurring in japan on water resources bréda and badeau 2008 and de cáceres et al 2015 suggested the rising risk of water stress for french and spanish forests due to changing climate bréda and badeau 2008 additionally proposed forest thinning as a strategy to alleviate the risk this wide use of practical models was primarily because these models had overcome the limitations of the models proposed around 1990 first practical models proposed around 2000 had simpler structures suited to the target purposes researchers excluded processes that were unessential for their purposes and used simpler equations not to make the models too complex such simplification of the models allowed wide use of the models this contrasts with complex models for small scales proposed around 1990 which had been rarely used for practical purposes however we note that the models for small scales proposed around 1990 were important in that the models gave the basis for the simplification of models the simplification of models demands researchers to choose essential processes among various processes of the water carbon and nutrient cycles for this researchers need to have sufficient understandings of the relationships among different processes such understandings were exactly what the models proposed around 1990 advanced models proposed around 1990 thus indirectly contributed to the development of practical models proposed around 2000 in addition development of simple models is partly supported by results of studies elucidating physical meaning of empirical equations models proposed around 2000 indeed used many equations that had been regarded as empirical and therefore had been avoided in previous models indeed many models use equations that estimate evapotranspiration from potential evapotranspiration table 2 such equations are exactly what stewart and thom 1973 declined as lacking a physically sound description of evapotranspiration p 154 similarly such equations were rarely used in the models for small scales proposed around 1990 e g forest bgc shetran biomass and maestro besides the use of empirical equations models proposed around 2000 often assumes the forest canopy as one big leaf e g battaglia and sands 1998 calder 2003 komatsu et al 2007a 2015 this big leaf assumption was avoided in many models proposed around 1990 mcmurtrie et al 1990b 1990a 1992b zhang et al 1996 possibly because researchers at that time believed that this big leaf assumption would make the physical meaning of parameters unclear finnigan and raupach 1987 amthor 1994 baldocchi and meyers 1998 however the understandings of empirical equations and assumptions had advanced greatly mainly in the 1990s by theoretical studies using process based models e g mcnaughton and spriggs 1986 mcnaughton and jarvis 1991 kelliher et al 1995 raupach 1995 consequently researchers began to regard such empirical equations and assumptions as physically sound the dichotomy between complex physical models and simple empirical models thus became somewhat irrelevant which opened the possibility that simple models could be applied to various conditions if model parameters are tuned appropriately second many practical models for small scales proposed around 2000 had parameters that had been tuned for target species in a target area e g calder 2003 komatsu et al 2007a 2015 as described in the previous section researchers realized that using one common set of parameters for various model predictions would cause large errors in the predicted results parameters tuned using data for target species in a target area allow more precise model predictions e g komatsu et al 2014 tsuruta et al 2019 this fine parameter tuning was possible because a large amount of data became available around this period in the 1990s climate change was recognized as one major issue in international communities ipcc 1990 1995 this urged researchers in forest hydrology and related fields to conduct measurements of forest water carbon and nutrient cycles in a number of sites across the world e g williams et al 1996 baldocchi et al 1997 kelliher et al 1997 1998 hollinger et al 1999 results of such measurements were used not only for improving the accuracy of models for large scales but for developing simple models for small scales and fine tuning of model parameters granier et al 1999 2000 komatsu 2003 2004 2005 komatsu et al 2007a sun et al 2011a third models proposed around 2000 often use parameters traditionally used in forestry e g the diameter of breast height and stem density this allows models proposed around 2000 to be used for assessing the impact of forest management on the water cycle e g battaglia and sands 1998 sands et al 2000 almeida et al 2010 komatsu et al 2015 komatsu 2020 the use of traditional parameters in the models has been promoted by the establishment of the sap flux method for measuring canopy transpiration in the 1990s granier et al 1990 1992 1996a b kostner et al 1992 1998 granier and loustau 1994 hatton et al 1995 the sap flux method uses traditional parameters for scaling up from tree to canopy transpiration and therefore allows researchers to understand the relationships between these traditional parameters and transpiration consequently researchers succeeded in developing equations for assessing the impact of changes in traditional parameters e g diameter of breast height and stem density on transpiration and then the forest water cycle sands et al 2000 komatsu et al 2015 komatsu 2020 indeed the model proposed by komatsu et al 2015 uses an equation representing the relationship of transpiration with the forest sapwood area and then with diameter of breast height and stem density this relationship was developed using the sap flux method komatsu et al 2014 built on komatsu et al 2015 komatsu 2020 further developed a model that would allow coupling with yield tables i e data for diameter of breast height and stem density for various management history this coupling with yield tables enables predicting changes in evapotranspiration for various management history of japanese cedar and cypress e g initial stem density and the number intensity and type of thinning 7 role of forest hydrologists in the current context we reviewed the history of model development in previous sections since the 1960s evapotranspiration modeling moved forward to improving model applicability to various sites and purposes fig 2 this move culminated in the development of complex models proposed around 1990 however researchers and policymakers recognized that such complex models were not very useful for practical purposes e g landsberg and waring 1998 mäkelä et al 2000 sands 2001 at this point researchers and policymakers arguably began to recognize two types of model applicability i e potential applicability and practical applicability and the trade off between these two see calder 2003 landsberg 2003 potential applicability means whether or not the model is potentially applicable to various contexts i e various areas species and purposes practically applicability means whether or not the model is effectively used for a specific area species and purpose prioritizing practical applicability over potential applicability researchers then started devising more practical models around 2000 by limiting model applicability to a particular area species and purpose against this historical backdrop we assert that one major role of forest hydrologists in this era is to develop practical models to assist policymaking recall that practical models do not always lack physical meaning as described in the previous section see also schoups et al 2008 for a related discussion to develop relevant practical models forest hydrologists should be flexible to understand emerging environmental challenges ahead of us and respond to these challenges quickly to enable adaptation of human society within a limited time frame indeed we have been already witnessing unprecedented environmental challenges that affect forest ecosystems for example changing climate including rainfall regime has been damaging forests in various areas bréda and badeau 2008 de cáceres et al 2015 keenan 2015 forest management is deemed as countermeasures to improve the resilience of forest ecosystems bréda and badeau 2008 kerhoulas et al 2013 calev et al 2016 at the same time forests are expected to play the role of carbon sequestration and alleviation of climate change silver et al 2000 jackson et al 2005 locatelli et al 2015 furthermore the rising atmospheric co2 concentration as well as the potential oil scarcity can trigger a large scale natural and man made conversion of tree species keenan 2015 eisner et al 2016 komatsu and rappleye 2017b this species conversion potentially affects water resources and other ecosystem services forest scientists including hydrologists are expected to assess the potential of forest management to counter such emerging challenges and assist policymaking for such an assessment forest hydrologists may develop practical models suited to a target issue in a target area we assert that the primary role of forest hydrologists is to respond to emerging environmental challenges using practical models this does not mean that forest hydrology needs no further basic studies on evapotranspiration and the water cycle indeed improving understandings modeling of evapotranspiration processes is necessary and will improve our capacity to respond to environmental challenges as detailed below particularly important is 1 to improve understandings of interception evaporation under high rainfall intensity and 2 to improve modeling of forest floor and understory evapotranspiration with vegetation indices interception evaporation particularly that under high rainfall intensity has not been understood well most interception models cannot explain the increase of rainfall interception with incident rainfall intensity although this phenomenon is widely observed in many areas with high rainfall intensity hattori et al 1982 murakami 2006 2007 see also saito et al 2013 and iida et al 2017 most interception models are not always useful for modeling interception evaporation and annual water balance in these areas furthermore the increase in interception evaporation with incident rainfall intensity suggests that forests might contribute to alleviating flood disasters the role of forests on flood control has been under controversy archer 2003 2007 calder and aylward 2006 bradshaw et al 2007 grant et al 2008 alila et al 2009 2010 lewis et al 2010 bathurst et al 2010 komatsu et al 2011b improving our understanding of the interception evaporation processes under high rainfall intensity will lead to better understandings of the role of forests on flood control it is important to note that rainfall intensity has been increasing in a variety of areas e g hirabayashi et al 2008 trenberth 2011 kao et al 2013 this change in rainfall intensity makes the modeling of interception evaporation under high rainfall intensity more important we also recommend attempts to model forest floor and understory evapotranspiration with the input of vegetation properties many previous studies focused on relationships between canopy tree properties and evapotranspiration ewers et al 2005 tsuruta et al 2015 kume et al 2016 however forest management practices include changes in forest floor and understory vegetation it is thus preferable to model changes in evapotranspiration with changing forest floor and understory vegetation actually there are many studies measuring forest floor and understory vegetation evapotranspiration at various sites schaap and bouten 1997 wilson et al 2000 deguchi et al 2008 kumagai et al 2014 sun et al 2016 what is lacking is an attempt to collate data of these previous studies to develop a model that relates evapotranspiration with structural factors one major obstacle for this attempt is that the mathematical framework used to analyze evapotranspiration of forest floor and understory vegetation was inconsistent among previous studies this contrasts with studies that examined canopy tree evapotranspiration such studies collectively used the penman monteith equation as the analytical framework we thus recommend re analyzing original data of forest floor and understory evapotranspiration using one specific mathematical framework besides refining the understandings of evapotranspiration we also recommend continuously validating practical models although practical models often use physically sound simple equations practical models may ignore feedback that greatly affect the results of model predictions model predictions thus need to be continuously compared with observations to check whether the models are useful for the target purpose if relevant observation results are unavailable one alternative way is to compare results predicted by practical models and those predicted by more complex models landsberg and gower 1997 cuddington et al 2013 results predicted by complex models are not always more accurate than those predicted by simple practical models e g hanson et al 2004 seong et al 2017 still such a comparison will allow model users to understand key characteristics of the practical models and then contemplate whether the practical models are suited for the target purpose although we recommend refining the understandings of evapotranspiration processes and validating practical models for small scales we underscore once again that forest hydrologists should not pursuit one complete and comprehensive model that is applicable to any place species and purposes such a model is neither necessary nor desirable from both scientific and practical viewpoints from a scientific viewpoint both simplification and specialization of models are essential one major role of models is to improve understandings of a target phenomenon models thus need to select processes that are essential for understanding the target phenomenon while ignoring other unessential processes cartwright 1983 1989 murray 2002 2007 weisberg 2013 models applicable to any place species and purpose must include various processes and are therefore unlikely to play the role of reducing information and improving our understanding of the target phenomenon from a practical viewpoint comprehensive models applicable to any area species and purpose do not always provide more accurate predictions than simplified ones for several reasons first models with high potential applicability i e those applicable to any areas species and purposes require a variety of model inputs and therefore need to use less accurate data components for example several process based models of evapotranspiration need wind speed as input e g baldocchi and meyers 1998 katul and albertson 1998 1999 kumagai et al 2006 xue et al 2011 although accurate data for wind speed are not always available particularly at a regional scale this inaccuracy in wind speed data can be one source of model inaccuracy see van rompaery and govers 2002 for a related discussion second errors associated with parameter determination are not always smaller for models with high potential applicability in reality focusing on a particular region and species often allows more accurate parameter determination komatsu et al 2015 tsuruta et al 2019 from both scientific and practical viewpoints models thus need to be developed considering the context of the target issue earlier in this section we asserted that forest hydrologists should be flexible to respond promptly to emerging environmental challenges we are not merely saying though important that forest hydrologists should contribute to the acceleration of the iterative processes of policymaking i e monitoring assessments decisions and implementation usda forest service 1996 allen et al 2011 our point is that forest hydrology and other practical sciences should rearticulate their role in policymaking one typical or stereotypical role of science is to provide objective knowledge which is independent of subjective views for the ordinary public see collins and pinch 1993 1998 latour 1987 1993 1998 1999 haraway 1988 that is the role of scientists is deemed to enlighten the ordinary public keenan 2015 komatsu and rappleye 2017a in this enlightenment scheme models are ideally regarded as representing objective knowledge fig 4 a however this enlightenment scheme has several problems and needs to be replaced the first reason is practical this enlightenment scheme can nullify the necessity of connecting different stakeholders e g forest managers water managers and local residents and then make collective decision making and action difficult the reason is that objective knowledge is in definition independent of subjective views and therefore connecting different stakeholders for better knowledge and decision making is irrelevant fig 4a however studies in environmental psychology and adaptation science suggest that the sense of connectedness among stakeholders is often useful resources for collective decision making and action tompkins and adger 2004 arnocky et al 2007 aldrich 2012 chuang et al 2016 komatsu and rappleye 2017a 2018 komatsu et al 2019 2020 komatsu 2020 against this backdrop we recommend forest hydrologists using practical models with simple structure for facilitating communications among stakeholders for collective decision making practical models with simple structure are easy to understand for not only specialists but non specialists and therefore provide the common ground for communications among different stakeholders fig 4b in this facilitation scheme models will demonstrate internal relationships between interests of different stakeholders e g securing water resources increasing timber production storing carbon dioxide and conserving biodiversity each stakeholder will then be able to learn how their potential decision making affects other stakeholders this process of learning will promote not only mutual understandings but the sense of connectedness among stakeholders see rappleye and komatsu 2017 lalicic and önder 2018 and komatsu and rappleye 2020 for related discussions in this sense the role of practical hydrological models will be functionally equivalent to that of virtual visualization technology used in urban planning salter et al 2009 wu et al 2010 virtual visualization technology allows non specialists including residents to participate in decision making processes for urban planning the point of using this technology is not to provide a particular decision based on the technology but to facilitate communications among different stakeholders including residents such communications among different stakeholders will enhance the understanding of interdependence i e we ness markus and kitayama 1991 2010 markus and conner 2014 among stakeholders and eventually catalyze the collective decision making of stakeholders similarly practical hydrological models potentially allow non specialists to participate in decision making for collective decision making we are not however saying that forest hydrologists and other practical scientists should rearticulate their role in policymaking merely for practical necessity i e for dealing with emerging environmental challenges we are not recommending practical scientists including forest hydrologists to prioritize practical necessity over scientific soundness we rather assert that rearticulating the role of forest hydrologists and practical scientists is also one important step for making natural science philosophically sound komatsu et al 2019 as mentioned before one typical or stereotypical image of science is to provide objective knowledge which is independent of subjective views however philosophers of science proposed that this image of science inflicted many paradoxes inhering in natural science hanson 1958 kuhn 1962 hanson 1958 suggested that although science is quite often believed to be an activity to gradually approach objective knowledge its methods of observations and experiments are already influenced by scientists view of the world kuhn 1962 pointed out that scientists implicitly share a common ground i e a paradigm which guides scientists to examine a particular object in a particular way kuhn s concept of a truth is interdependent of the subjective view shared by scientific and related communities philosophers of science thus propose to rearticulate the role and image of science quine 1951 1961 kuhn 1962 rorty 1982 1991 ohmori 1994 1996 latour 1987 1993 1998 1999 haraway 1988 for example one contemporary philosopher of science latour 1998 states in his short essay published in science that there is now an alternative to the old slogan of science the more disconnected a discipline from society the better now resonates a more realistic call for action the more connected a scientific discipline the better p 209 italics added this alternative image of science corroborates our proposal of rearticulating the role of forest hydrologists according to this alternative image of science facilitating communications among different stakeholders will be one effective way to make forest hydrology philosophically and methodologically sound as well as to improve its practical usefulness that is using practical models in forest hydrology will be one good

5583,there exist very few reviews of models that predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management e g clearcutting and thinning this omission has potentially prevented forest hydrologists from effectively identifying critical research topics and collaborating with policymakers practitioners and researchers in related fields to assist policymaking to remedy this omission the current study elaborates why models were needed in the first place and how models were developed historically models were developed to overcome limitations of traditional meta analyses of measurement studies i e inability to explain between site variations in evapotranspiration changes with forest management that had been recognized since the 1960s with the improvement of the understandings about evapotranspiration processes forest hydrologists proposed models that could predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management around 1990 among the models proposed around 1990 models for large scales were widely used for practical purposes e g assessing the impact of large scale deforestation on the continental and global water cycle however models for small scales were not widely used for assessing the impacts of forest management on water resources and other practical purposes one major reason for this was that models for small scales proposed around 1990 were primarily designed as research tools to improve practical applicability forest hydrologists then started developing simple practical models for small scales that focused on applications to a particular area species and purpose around 2000 considering the necessity of human society to adapt to emerging environmental challenges within a limited time frame we conclude that the primary role of forest hydrologists in this era is to quickly detect emerging environmental challenges and then develop practical models for connecting different stakeholders for collective decision making this paper also suggests that the use of practical models can be a starting point to rearticulate the role of forest hydrologists in policymaking keywords adaptation climate change decision making ecosystem resilience evaporation water management 1 introduction forest management e g clearcutting and thinning changes forest structure and then changes water carbon and nutrient cycles in forest ecosystems among changes in various components of water carbon and nutrient cycles examining changes in evapotranspiration is particularly important one major reason is that evapotranspiration is altered directly by changes in forest structure induced by forest management changes in evapotranspiration then lead to changes in other components including water runoff photosynthesis and nutrient leaching landsberg and gower 1997 waring and running 1998 ellison et al 2017 examining changes in evapotranspiration with forest management is thus one starting point for comprehensively understanding changes in water carbon and nutrient cycles induced by forest management in addition examining changes in evapotranspiration with forest management is important from a practical viewpoint evapotranspiration affects water runoff from forested catchments and then water resources available for humans calder et al 2003 komatsu et al 2008 2012a sun et al 2017 researchers have been conducting studies measuring changes in annual runoff which approximate changes in annual evapotranspiration with forest management e g cornish 1993 stoneman 1993 lane and mackay 2001 results of such measurement studies have been then reviewed to understand similarity and differences between studies sites e g bosch and hewlett 1982 kuraji 2003 andréassian 2004 brown et al 2005 more importantly researchers have developed models that predict changes in evapotranspiration and runoff with forest management e g granier et al 1999 vertessy et al 2001 calder 2003 komatsu et al 2007a 2015 such models are particularly important in the current context because forest management is deemed as potential measures to counter environmental challenges human society is currently facing for example climate change e g changes in rainfall regime and evaporative demand has been damaging forest ecosystems through plant water relations and exacerbating water shortages in many regions bréda and badeau 2008 de cáceres et al 2015 keenan 2015 forest management e g thinning is proposed as potential measures to alleviate forest damages and water shortages vose et al 2011 grant et al 2013 kerhoulas et al 2013 sun and vose 2016 vilà cabrera et al 2018 to examine the effectiveness of forest management for such purposes it is necessary to assess potential changes in evapotranspiration and catchment runoff with forest management despite the importance of assessing changes in evapotranspiration with forest management very few papers have reviewed models that predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management this contrasts with the presence of many papers that review observed changes in annual runoff with forest management bosch and hewlett 1982 sahin and hall 1996 andréassian 2004 brown et al 2005 iida et al 2019 this omission has potentially prevented forest hydrologists from effectively identifying critical research topics in modeling and collaborating with policymakers practitioners e g forest and water managers and researchers in related fields e g ecology civil engineering and adaptation science for the adaptation of human society to emerging environmental challenges the current study reviews models that predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management this review paper elaborates why models were needed in the first place and how models were developed historically this elaboration allows forest hydrologists to consciously grasp the historical contexts of modeling evapotranspiration changes with forest management at the same time this elaboration provides basic information for non specialists policymakers practitioners and researchers in related fields to promote collaboration with forest hydrologists this review then discusses the role of forest hydrologists under the current context and finally contemplate how forest hydrologists potentially contribute to the adaption of human society to environmental challenges in this century 2 why models were needed there exist numerous measurement studies that examined changes in evapotranspiration or runoff which approximates the difference between rainfall and evapotranspiration with forest management in addition several studies conducted meta analyses of these measurement studies besides measurement studies and meta analyses why did forest hydrologists need to model changes in evapotranspiration the primary reason was that through previous measurement studies and meta analyses researchers recognized that variations in the results among different studies sites could not be explained easily without considering underlying processes modeling was one way to consider underlying processes as early as in the 1960s the difficulty in explaining variations in the results among different studies sites began to be recognized one classic meta analytic study hibbert 1967 collated changes in annual runoff with reduction in forest cover by various forest management practices from 39 measurement studies and found large variations in annual runoff increase among studies hibbert 1967 on one hand observed a consistent trend among studies sites that reduction in forest cover in a catchment increased annual runoff hibbert 1967 on the other hand highlighted large unexplained variations in annual runoff changes among studies sites concerning these unexplained variations hibbert 1967 p 535 stated that the magnitude of treatment response varied considerably complete cutting and burning of scrub aspen forest high in the colorado rockies caused streamflow to increase only 34 mm during the first year after cutting whereas in the mountains of east africa complete cutting and removal of high bamboo forest increased water yield by 457 mm these extreme examples reflect the diverse nature of the results and hint at the complexity of the causative factors as hibbert 1967 stated unexplained variations in annual runoff increase often reached several hundred millimeters in another place of the same paper hibbert 1967 stated that variations among studies were highly variable and for the most part unpredictable p 535 italics added despite the repetition of similar meta analyses using more extensive datasets by succeeding studies most parts of variations among studies sites have remained unexplained bosch and hewlett 1982 sahin and hall 1996 stednick 1996 andréassian 2004 brown et al 2005 adams and fowler 2006 komatsu et al 2011a zhang et al 2017 for example andréassian 2004 obtained qualitatively the same results as those of hibbert 1967 and stated that the results are extremely scattered as already observed by hibbert 1967 p 11 according to andréassian s 2004 meta analysis several studies observed virtually no increase in annual runoff with deforestation of the whole experimental catchment while several other studies observed a more than 600 mm increase in annual runoff fig 1 such large variations among different studies sites suggest that these traditional meta analyses are not very useful for providing implications for practical forest management strategies and policymaking komatsu et al 2007b komatsu 2010 in addition to the case for forest cover reduction many studies reported inconsistent results among different catchments with species conversion swank and douglass 1974 reported a decrease in annual runoff with converting broadleaf forests to coniferous plantations suggesting higher annual evapotranspiration for coniferous plantations than broadleaf forests although several studies also reported higher annual evapotranspiration for coniferous plantations than broadleaf forests cannell 1999 calder et al 2003 nisbet 2005 komatsu et al 2008 other studies reported comparable annual evapotranspiration between coniferous plantations and broadleaf forests dons 1987 fahey and jackson 1997 pizarro et al 2006 komatsu et al 2007a 2009 2011a these results also underline the difficulty in explaining changes in annual runoff and evapotranspiration with forest management by traditional meta analyses another practical problem of traditional meta analyses is that it does not consider variations in forest management methods bosch and hewlett 1982 did not distinguish for example the following two cases 1 selective thinning of the whole catchment by 30 of the total basal area and 2 clearcutting of a 30 area of the catchment such inability of considering variations in forest management methods also suggests one limitation of traditional meta analyses although the purposes of using models are numerous one major purpose is to overcome the limitations of measurement studies and traditional meta analyses models consider not only the input i e forest management and output i e annual evapotranspiration and runoff but processes between the input and output more specifically models calculate various components of evapotranspiration i e tree transpiration rainfall interception and forest floor evapotranspiration at a short time scale e g daily time scale which potentially leads to comprehensive understandings of variations in annual runoff changes among studies sites 3 understandings of evapotranspiration were improved during 1970 1990 it was around 1990 when many models that could predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management were proposed fig 2 such models had been rarely proposed for approximately 20 years since hibbert s 1967 meta analytic study these 20 years i e the 1970s and 1980s were not spent in determining the general direction of modeling from the outset forest hydrologists largely shared one clear direction forest hydrologists had consistently tried to develop a model that considered underlying physical processes in the introduction of a seminal paper published in 1973 stewart and thom 1973 declared the necessity of process based understanding and modeling of evapotranspiration some empirical methods do exist for obtaining actual evaporation from potential evaporation however we must turn to the penman equation itself in the form which describes the evaporation from an unsaturated surface to find a physically sound description of the problem p 154 italics added similarly we find many studies that attempted to analyze evapotranspiration data based on the physical theory of evapotranspiration i e the penman monteith equation around 1970 waggoner and reifsnyder 1968 waggoner et al 1969 rutter et al 1971 1975 mcnaughton and black 1973 stewart and thom 1973 this strong commitment to process based understanding and modeling might be partly because forest hydrologists had witnessed a success in modeling crop and grassland evapotranspiration by agronomists using the penman monteith equation in the 1960s monteith et al 1965 van bavel 1967 szeicz and long 1969 despite this strong commitment to the development of process based models it took approximately 20 years for forest hydrologists to develop process based models that can be used to assess changes in evapotranspiration with forest management during the 20 years forest hydrologists needed to overcome several difficulties described below one difficulty was technical to examine applicability of evapotranspiration theory to forest evapotranspiration forest hydrologists needed unprecedentedly large facilities including measurement towers to access the above canopy atmosphere e g stewart and thom 1973 shuttleworth et al 1984 measurement towers to access forest canopies were essential to obtain evapotranspiration data at a short time scale e g an hourly scale using micrometeorological methods additionally forest evapotranspiration should be ideally observed across seasons evapotranspiration from forests often continues in winter e g shuttleworth and calder 1979 humphreys et al 2003 and even in dry seasons e g tanaka et al 2003 kume et al 2007 this contrasts with many crops of which evapotranspiration occurs mainly in growing seasons another difficulty was scientific even if evapotranspiration data for various forest sites become available parameterization of forest evapotranspiration is not easy one major reason is that forest evapotranspiration is regulated strongly by biological processes rather than physical processes mcnaughton and black 1973 mcnaughton and jarvis 1983 jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 more specifically forest evapotranspiration is regulated mainly by stomatal aperture rather than aerodynamic diffusion of water vapor from leaves to the atmosphere this contrasts with evapotranspiration from crops in which biological processes play relatively a minor role consequently forest evapotranspiration is highly sensitive to parameters representing biological processes such as surface canopy conductance in the penman monteith equation however parameterization of biological processes is much more difficult than that of physical processes unlike physical processes shaw and pereira 1982 raupach 1994 biological processes are not always strongly related to structural properties of forests oren et al 1999 modeling of biological processes was so difficult during 1970 1990 that several forest hydrologists modeled biological processes using a function of time without considering any internal processes calder 1977 rampisela et al 1990 this difficulty in modeling biological processes made parameterization of evapotranspiration from dry forest canopies much more difficult than that from wet forest canopies i e interception evaporation which is unrelated to biological processes rutter et al 1971 gash 1979 this difficulty in modeling biological processes was gradually relaxed first by developing empirical relationships between the biological processes and meteorological factors jarvis 1976 lindroth 1985 and then by interpreting the empirical relationships using the hydraulic theory of stomata regulation oren et al 1999 2001 4 models began to be proposed around 1990 it was around 1990 when models that can predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management e g thinning pruning and harvesting and other large scale land use changes e g deforestation and urbanization began to be proposed around this period the difficulties explained above had been largely overcome more specifically applicability of evapotranspiration theory i e the penman monteith equation to forest evapotranspiration was confirmed by measurement studies in the 1970s and 1980s mcnaughton and black 1973 gash and stewart 1975 tan and black 1976 milne 1979 verma et al 1986 at the same time year round evapotranspiration data began to be reported e g shuttleworth and calder 1979 stewart 1988 and methods for parameterizing biological processes advanced lindroth 1985 gash et al 1989 these advances in research prepared the theoretical and methodological ground to develop models that could predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management fig 2 models proposed around 1990 varied according to the target spatial scales table 1 models like sechiba bats sib and others i e models for large scales mainly aimed to assess changes in water carbon and nutrient cycles with global and continental land use changes e g amazonian deforestation in contrast models like forest bgc shetran biomass maestro and others i e models for small scales mainly aimed to assess changes in water carbon and nutrient cycles with more nuanced forest management practices e g thinning and harvesting at smaller scales e g stand catchment and regional scales note that models proposed around 1990 did not exclusively aim to predict changes in evapotranspiration and the water cycle with forest management for example biomass focused more on predicting the forest carbon cycle rather than the water cycle still such models can be used to predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management models for large scales have been widely used since they were proposed e g gao et al 2010 whereas models for small scales have been rarely used for example it is easy to find papers using the swat model for practical purposes such as proposing water resource management e g baker and miller 2013 zhou et al 2013 indeed the number of citable documents including swat model arnold the name of one representative model developer and water resources increased from 163 in the 1990s to 10 000 in the 2010s according to google scholar this contrasts with the case for forest bgc although forest bgc is similar to the swat model in the complexity of the evapotranspiration routine very few papers use forest bgc model for proposing water resource management the number of citable documents including forest bgc model running i e the name of one representative model developer and water resources increased from 89 in the 1990s only to 148 in the 2010s it is true that one derivative of forest bgc i e biome bgc has been widely used for practical purposes however biome bgc has been mainly used at regional continental and global scales e g gordon and famiglietti 2004 milesi et al 2005 mu et al 2007 when biome bgc is used at smaller scales it is usually used as research tools rather than application tools kimball et al 1997 ueyama et al 2010 see the discussion in the next section it is somewhat surprising that models for small scales were rarely used for practical purposes because many models for small scales were designed to allow wide applications indeed researchers provided default model parameters for applications not only at experimental sites but in regions where measurement data were unavailable e g waring and running 1998 several researchers even distributed the source code of the model e g waring and running 1998 medlyn 2004 these models thus contrasted with models developed in the 1980s that were designed for understanding the water cycle at a particular experimental site spittlehouse and black 1981 kelliher et al 1986 more importantly many models proposed around 1990 tended to use process based equations rather than empirical equations to guarantee the applicability of the models to a place where measurements were unavailable in terms of the evapotranspiration submodel most models e g forest bgc shetran biomass and maestro used the penman monteith equation in addition biomass divided the forest canopy vertically into several layers to calculate the vertical distribution of evapotranspiration maestro even considered three dimensional distribution of trees in a forest and calculated evapotranspiration for each tree this strong commitment to process based modeling might be partly due to the response of the academic community to climate change around 1990 climate change was recognized as a major environmental challenge for human society e g spielman 1989 ipcc 1990 1995 see also houghton 2015 to predict responses of forests to untested conditions e g under warmer climate researchers used process based equations rather than empirical equations developed in the past and current conditions ryan et al 1996a b landsberg and gower 1997 tian et al 1998 komatsu and hashimoto 2002 5 problems of the models for small scales proposed around 1990 most models for small scales proposed around 1990 were not widely used for practical purposes e g assessing the impacts of forest management on water resources despite the intention of model developers many researchers suggested that the primary reason was that the models were developed from the viewpoint of researchers landsberg and waring 1998 battaglia and sands 1998 mäkelä et al 2000 sands 2001 tickle et al 2001 landsberg 2003 for example landsberg and waring 1998 p 210 state all these models however are essentially research tools and have yet to be simplified to the point where they are of value or indeed of interest to practical forest managers this statement is corroborated by our finding in table 1 models for small scales are often used for understanding phenomena observed at experimental sites rather than conducting assessments for supporting policymaking what prevented the models for small scales from being used for practical purposes we find at least four main factors first the structure of the models was too complex for example forest bgc calculates not only the water cycle but carbon and nutrient cycles this comprehensive nature allows forest bgc to be potentially used for various purposes however policymakers and practitioners who have a specific purpose might find this comprehensive nature as redundant second the models usually need adjustments of default parameter values many studies using default parameter values found a considerable discrepancy between model predictions and observations e g cienciala et al 1998 hingston et al 1998 chiesi et al 2002 hoff and joffre 2002 these discrepancy suggests the necessity of adjusting default parameter values when applying the model to a certain place these results were supported by the results of meta analytic studies wilson et al 2002 komatsu 2003 2005 komatsu et al 2012b see also ewers et al 2011 these meta analytic studies collating evapotranspiration data derived from micrometeorological and sap flux methods found large variations in key parameters e g surface conductance for evapotranspiration among different sites surface conductance data for 34 coniferous forest sites collated by komatsu 2003 ranged between 3 mm s 1 and 20 mm s 1 fig 3 a this suggests that evapotranspiration rates for one coniferous forest can be more than six times of those for another coniferous forest when assuming a full coupling between the canopy and the atmosphere the mean and standard deviation of surface conductance for the 34 coniferous forest sites were 10 2 and 4 4 mm s 1 the range in which 95 of surface conductance data falls will be thus between 1 4 and 19 0 mm s 1 if we assume a normal distribution of data the upper end of the range is thus approximately 14 times of the lower end these large variations in surface conductance and other equivalent parameters were not sufficiently explained by the variations in the leaf area index among sites fig 3b although models e g running and coughlan 1988 mcmurtrie et al 1990a b 1992b running and gower 1991 often considered the leaf area index for modeling evapotranspiration see ichihashi et al 2015 2019 for related discussions although canopy height explains some of the variations in evapotranspiration among different forest sites across the world komatsu 2003 2004 2005 its explanatory power is still too low e g irvine et al 2002 2004 kumagai et al 2007 2008 komatsu et al 2014 kume et al 2016 tsuruta et al 2019 we surmise that researchers who realized this difficulty in explaining variations in evapotranspiration among different forest sites were reluctant to apply models for small scales e g forest bgc shetran biomass and maestro to their own target area such variations in evapotranspiration among forest sites would not be a major problem for models for large scales models for large scales are usually used to assess changes in the water cycle with a drastic change such as deforestation and urbanization table 1 these models are thus expected to distinguish evapotranspiration between drastically different land uses e g between forests and grasslands which is easier than to distinguish evapotranspiration between forests with different species and management history kelliher et al 1993 1995 schulze et al 1994 furthermore models for large scales often consider the planetary boundary feedback and therefore model predictions are less sensitive to evapotranspiration parameters such as surface conductance mcnaughton 1989 mcnaughton and jarvis 1991 third the models included too many parameters this is a consequence of that the models considered various processes of water carbon and nutrient cycles as described above model users often find a discrepancy between predictions and observations and therefore they need to determine parameters for themselves in actuality this determination of model parameters is generally difficult one major reason is that the models include various processes and therefore model parameterization requires data for various components of water carbon and nutrient cycles if such data are unavailable model users cannot find a way to reasonably determine model parameters even if model users find a parameter set that gives a good fit between calculations and observations there will be potentially other parameter sets that give comparably good fits due to the high degree of freedom see beven 2000 beven and freer 2001 fourth many models for small scales proposed around 1990 did not use parameters traditionally used for forest management e g diameter of breast height basal area and stem density model users could rarely use existing traditional data as model inputs and validation data for model outputs despite the availability of traditional data at small scales this contrasts with the case for models for large scales at large scales the inability of using traditional data was not problematic global scale datasets for traditional parameters e g diameter of breast height basal area and stem density were virtually unavailable many models for large scales rather use data derived from remote sensing e g cleugh et al 2007 mu et al 2007 marshall et al 2013 6 practical models for small scales began to be proposed around 2000 as the problems of the models for small scales proposed around 1990 were widely recognized researchers began to propose more practical models for small scales e g stand catchment and regional scales around 2000 landsberg and waring 1998 sun et al 1998a b granier et al 1999 calder 2003 calder et al 2003 komatsu et al 2007a 2015 fig 2 using these models researchers also started assessing the impact of actual forest and water management issues table 2 for example calder et al 2003 assessed the impact of afforestation proposed by the united kingdom government on water resources komatsu et al 2007a evaluated the impact of forest species conversion occurring in japan on water resources bréda and badeau 2008 and de cáceres et al 2015 suggested the rising risk of water stress for french and spanish forests due to changing climate bréda and badeau 2008 additionally proposed forest thinning as a strategy to alleviate the risk this wide use of practical models was primarily because these models had overcome the limitations of the models proposed around 1990 first practical models proposed around 2000 had simpler structures suited to the target purposes researchers excluded processes that were unessential for their purposes and used simpler equations not to make the models too complex such simplification of the models allowed wide use of the models this contrasts with complex models for small scales proposed around 1990 which had been rarely used for practical purposes however we note that the models for small scales proposed around 1990 were important in that the models gave the basis for the simplification of models the simplification of models demands researchers to choose essential processes among various processes of the water carbon and nutrient cycles for this researchers need to have sufficient understandings of the relationships among different processes such understandings were exactly what the models proposed around 1990 advanced models proposed around 1990 thus indirectly contributed to the development of practical models proposed around 2000 in addition development of simple models is partly supported by results of studies elucidating physical meaning of empirical equations models proposed around 2000 indeed used many equations that had been regarded as empirical and therefore had been avoided in previous models indeed many models use equations that estimate evapotranspiration from potential evapotranspiration table 2 such equations are exactly what stewart and thom 1973 declined as lacking a physically sound description of evapotranspiration p 154 similarly such equations were rarely used in the models for small scales proposed around 1990 e g forest bgc shetran biomass and maestro besides the use of empirical equations models proposed around 2000 often assumes the forest canopy as one big leaf e g battaglia and sands 1998 calder 2003 komatsu et al 2007a 2015 this big leaf assumption was avoided in many models proposed around 1990 mcmurtrie et al 1990b 1990a 1992b zhang et al 1996 possibly because researchers at that time believed that this big leaf assumption would make the physical meaning of parameters unclear finnigan and raupach 1987 amthor 1994 baldocchi and meyers 1998 however the understandings of empirical equations and assumptions had advanced greatly mainly in the 1990s by theoretical studies using process based models e g mcnaughton and spriggs 1986 mcnaughton and jarvis 1991 kelliher et al 1995 raupach 1995 consequently researchers began to regard such empirical equations and assumptions as physically sound the dichotomy between complex physical models and simple empirical models thus became somewhat irrelevant which opened the possibility that simple models could be applied to various conditions if model parameters are tuned appropriately second many practical models for small scales proposed around 2000 had parameters that had been tuned for target species in a target area e g calder 2003 komatsu et al 2007a 2015 as described in the previous section researchers realized that using one common set of parameters for various model predictions would cause large errors in the predicted results parameters tuned using data for target species in a target area allow more precise model predictions e g komatsu et al 2014 tsuruta et al 2019 this fine parameter tuning was possible because a large amount of data became available around this period in the 1990s climate change was recognized as one major issue in international communities ipcc 1990 1995 this urged researchers in forest hydrology and related fields to conduct measurements of forest water carbon and nutrient cycles in a number of sites across the world e g williams et al 1996 baldocchi et al 1997 kelliher et al 1997 1998 hollinger et al 1999 results of such measurements were used not only for improving the accuracy of models for large scales but for developing simple models for small scales and fine tuning of model parameters granier et al 1999 2000 komatsu 2003 2004 2005 komatsu et al 2007a sun et al 2011a third models proposed around 2000 often use parameters traditionally used in forestry e g the diameter of breast height and stem density this allows models proposed around 2000 to be used for assessing the impact of forest management on the water cycle e g battaglia and sands 1998 sands et al 2000 almeida et al 2010 komatsu et al 2015 komatsu 2020 the use of traditional parameters in the models has been promoted by the establishment of the sap flux method for measuring canopy transpiration in the 1990s granier et al 1990 1992 1996a b kostner et al 1992 1998 granier and loustau 1994 hatton et al 1995 the sap flux method uses traditional parameters for scaling up from tree to canopy transpiration and therefore allows researchers to understand the relationships between these traditional parameters and transpiration consequently researchers succeeded in developing equations for assessing the impact of changes in traditional parameters e g diameter of breast height and stem density on transpiration and then the forest water cycle sands et al 2000 komatsu et al 2015 komatsu 2020 indeed the model proposed by komatsu et al 2015 uses an equation representing the relationship of transpiration with the forest sapwood area and then with diameter of breast height and stem density this relationship was developed using the sap flux method komatsu et al 2014 built on komatsu et al 2015 komatsu 2020 further developed a model that would allow coupling with yield tables i e data for diameter of breast height and stem density for various management history this coupling with yield tables enables predicting changes in evapotranspiration for various management history of japanese cedar and cypress e g initial stem density and the number intensity and type of thinning 7 role of forest hydrologists in the current context we reviewed the history of model development in previous sections since the 1960s evapotranspiration modeling moved forward to improving model applicability to various sites and purposes fig 2 this move culminated in the development of complex models proposed around 1990 however researchers and policymakers recognized that such complex models were not very useful for practical purposes e g landsberg and waring 1998 mäkelä et al 2000 sands 2001 at this point researchers and policymakers arguably began to recognize two types of model applicability i e potential applicability and practical applicability and the trade off between these two see calder 2003 landsberg 2003 potential applicability means whether or not the model is potentially applicable to various contexts i e various areas species and purposes practically applicability means whether or not the model is effectively used for a specific area species and purpose prioritizing practical applicability over potential applicability researchers then started devising more practical models around 2000 by limiting model applicability to a particular area species and purpose against this historical backdrop we assert that one major role of forest hydrologists in this era is to develop practical models to assist policymaking recall that practical models do not always lack physical meaning as described in the previous section see also schoups et al 2008 for a related discussion to develop relevant practical models forest hydrologists should be flexible to understand emerging environmental challenges ahead of us and respond to these challenges quickly to enable adaptation of human society within a limited time frame indeed we have been already witnessing unprecedented environmental challenges that affect forest ecosystems for example changing climate including rainfall regime has been damaging forests in various areas bréda and badeau 2008 de cáceres et al 2015 keenan 2015 forest management is deemed as countermeasures to improve the resilience of forest ecosystems bréda and badeau 2008 kerhoulas et al 2013 calev et al 2016 at the same time forests are expected to play the role of carbon sequestration and alleviation of climate change silver et al 2000 jackson et al 2005 locatelli et al 2015 furthermore the rising atmospheric co2 concentration as well as the potential oil scarcity can trigger a large scale natural and man made conversion of tree species keenan 2015 eisner et al 2016 komatsu and rappleye 2017b this species conversion potentially affects water resources and other ecosystem services forest scientists including hydrologists are expected to assess the potential of forest management to counter such emerging challenges and assist policymaking for such an assessment forest hydrologists may develop practical models suited to a target issue in a target area we assert that the primary role of forest hydrologists is to respond to emerging environmental challenges using practical models this does not mean that forest hydrology needs no further basic studies on evapotranspiration and the water cycle indeed improving understandings modeling of evapotranspiration processes is necessary and will improve our capacity to respond to environmental challenges as detailed below particularly important is 1 to improve understandings of interception evaporation under high rainfall intensity and 2 to improve modeling of forest floor and understory evapotranspiration with vegetation indices interception evaporation particularly that under high rainfall intensity has not been understood well most interception models cannot explain the increase of rainfall interception with incident rainfall intensity although this phenomenon is widely observed in many areas with high rainfall intensity hattori et al 1982 murakami 2006 2007 see also saito et al 2013 and iida et al 2017 most interception models are not always useful for modeling interception evaporation and annual water balance in these areas furthermore the increase in interception evaporation with incident rainfall intensity suggests that forests might contribute to alleviating flood disasters the role of forests on flood control has been under controversy archer 2003 2007 calder and aylward 2006 bradshaw et al 2007 grant et al 2008 alila et al 2009 2010 lewis et al 2010 bathurst et al 2010 komatsu et al 2011b improving our understanding of the interception evaporation processes under high rainfall intensity will lead to better understandings of the role of forests on flood control it is important to note that rainfall intensity has been increasing in a variety of areas e g hirabayashi et al 2008 trenberth 2011 kao et al 2013 this change in rainfall intensity makes the modeling of interception evaporation under high rainfall intensity more important we also recommend attempts to model forest floor and understory evapotranspiration with the input of vegetation properties many previous studies focused on relationships between canopy tree properties and evapotranspiration ewers et al 2005 tsuruta et al 2015 kume et al 2016 however forest management practices include changes in forest floor and understory vegetation it is thus preferable to model changes in evapotranspiration with changing forest floor and understory vegetation actually there are many studies measuring forest floor and understory vegetation evapotranspiration at various sites schaap and bouten 1997 wilson et al 2000 deguchi et al 2008 kumagai et al 2014 sun et al 2016 what is lacking is an attempt to collate data of these previous studies to develop a model that relates evapotranspiration with structural factors one major obstacle for this attempt is that the mathematical framework used to analyze evapotranspiration of forest floor and understory vegetation was inconsistent among previous studies this contrasts with studies that examined canopy tree evapotranspiration such studies collectively used the penman monteith equation as the analytical framework we thus recommend re analyzing original data of forest floor and understory evapotranspiration using one specific mathematical framework besides refining the understandings of evapotranspiration we also recommend continuously validating practical models although practical models often use physically sound simple equations practical models may ignore feedback that greatly affect the results of model predictions model predictions thus need to be continuously compared with observations to check whether the models are useful for the target purpose if relevant observation results are unavailable one alternative way is to compare results predicted by practical models and those predicted by more complex models landsberg and gower 1997 cuddington et al 2013 results predicted by complex models are not always more accurate than those predicted by simple practical models e g hanson et al 2004 seong et al 2017 still such a comparison will allow model users to understand key characteristics of the practical models and then contemplate whether the practical models are suited for the target purpose although we recommend refining the understandings of evapotranspiration processes and validating practical models for small scales we underscore once again that forest hydrologists should not pursuit one complete and comprehensive model that is applicable to any place species and purposes such a model is neither necessary nor desirable from both scientific and practical viewpoints from a scientific viewpoint both simplification and specialization of models are essential one major role of models is to improve understandings of a target phenomenon models thus need to select processes that are essential for understanding the target phenomenon while ignoring other unessential processes cartwright 1983 1989 murray 2002 2007 weisberg 2013 models applicable to any place species and purpose must include various processes and are therefore unlikely to play the role of reducing information and improving our understanding of the target phenomenon from a practical viewpoint comprehensive models applicable to any area species and purpose do not always provide more accurate predictions than simplified ones for several reasons first models with high potential applicability i e those applicable to any areas species and purposes require a variety of model inputs and therefore need to use less accurate data components for example several process based models of evapotranspiration need wind speed as input e g baldocchi and meyers 1998 katul and albertson 1998 1999 kumagai et al 2006 xue et al 2011 although accurate data for wind speed are not always available particularly at a regional scale this inaccuracy in wind speed data can be one source of model inaccuracy see van rompaery and govers 2002 for a related discussion second errors associated with parameter determination are not always smaller for models with high potential applicability in reality focusing on a particular region and species often allows more accurate parameter determination komatsu et al 2015 tsuruta et al 2019 from both scientific and practical viewpoints models thus need to be developed considering the context of the target issue earlier in this section we asserted that forest hydrologists should be flexible to respond promptly to emerging environmental challenges we are not merely saying though important that forest hydrologists should contribute to the acceleration of the iterative processes of policymaking i e monitoring assessments decisions and implementation usda forest service 1996 allen et al 2011 our point is that forest hydrology and other practical sciences should rearticulate their role in policymaking one typical or stereotypical role of science is to provide objective knowledge which is independent of subjective views for the ordinary public see collins and pinch 1993 1998 latour 1987 1993 1998 1999 haraway 1988 that is the role of scientists is deemed to enlighten the ordinary public keenan 2015 komatsu and rappleye 2017a in this enlightenment scheme models are ideally regarded as representing objective knowledge fig 4 a however this enlightenment scheme has several problems and needs to be replaced the first reason is practical this enlightenment scheme can nullify the necessity of connecting different stakeholders e g forest managers water managers and local residents and then make collective decision making and action difficult the reason is that objective knowledge is in definition independent of subjective views and therefore connecting different stakeholders for better knowledge and decision making is irrelevant fig 4a however studies in environmental psychology and adaptation science suggest that the sense of connectedness among stakeholders is often useful resources for collective decision making and action tompkins and adger 2004 arnocky et al 2007 aldrich 2012 chuang et al 2016 komatsu and rappleye 2017a 2018 komatsu et al 2019 2020 komatsu 2020 against this backdrop we recommend forest hydrologists using practical models with simple structure for facilitating communications among stakeholders for collective decision making practical models with simple structure are easy to understand for not only specialists but non specialists and therefore provide the common ground for communications among different stakeholders fig 4b in this facilitation scheme models will demonstrate internal relationships between interests of different stakeholders e g securing water resources increasing timber production storing carbon dioxide and conserving biodiversity each stakeholder will then be able to learn how their potential decision making affects other stakeholders this process of learning will promote not only mutual understandings but the sense of connectedness among stakeholders see rappleye and komatsu 2017 lalicic and önder 2018 and komatsu and rappleye 2020 for related discussions in this sense the role of practical hydrological models will be functionally equivalent to that of virtual visualization technology used in urban planning salter et al 2009 wu et al 2010 virtual visualization technology allows non specialists including residents to participate in decision making processes for urban planning the point of using this technology is not to provide a particular decision based on the technology but to facilitate communications among different stakeholders including residents such communications among different stakeholders will enhance the understanding of interdependence i e we ness markus and kitayama 1991 2010 markus and conner 2014 among stakeholders and eventually catalyze the collective decision making of stakeholders similarly practical hydrological models potentially allow non specialists to participate in decision making for collective decision making we are not however saying that forest hydrologists and other practical scientists should rearticulate their role in policymaking merely for practical necessity i e for dealing with emerging environmental challenges we are not recommending practical scientists including forest hydrologists to prioritize practical necessity over scientific soundness we rather assert that rearticulating the role of forest hydrologists and practical scientists is also one important step for making natural science philosophically sound komatsu et al 2019 as mentioned before one typical or stereotypical image of science is to provide objective knowledge which is independent of subjective views however philosophers of science proposed that this image of science inflicted many paradoxes inhering in natural science hanson 1958 kuhn 1962 hanson 1958 suggested that although science is quite often believed to be an activity to gradually approach objective knowledge its methods of observations and experiments are already influenced by scientists view of the world kuhn 1962 pointed out that scientists implicitly share a common ground i e a paradigm which guides scientists to examine a particular object in a particular way kuhn s concept of a truth is interdependent of the subjective view shared by scientific and related communities philosophers of science thus propose to rearticulate the role and image of science quine 1951 1961 kuhn 1962 rorty 1982 1991 ohmori 1994 1996 latour 1987 1993 1998 1999 haraway 1988 for example one contemporary philosopher of science latour 1998 states in his short essay published in science that there is now an alternative to the old slogan of science the more disconnected a discipline from society the better now resonates a more realistic call for action the more connected a scientific discipline the better p 209 italics added this alternative image of science corroborates our proposal of rearticulating the role of forest hydrologists according to this alternative image of science facilitating communications among different stakeholders will be one effective way to make forest hydrology philosophically and methodologically sound as well as to improve its practical usefulness that is using practical models in forest hydrology will be one good

5584,hyporheic zone hz is the hotspot of contaminant biotransformation in ecosystems that affects water quality in both groundwater and river water hz is characterized by its dynamic changes in water flow direction that lead to the cyclic changes in aqueous chemical compositions such as dissolved oxygen do nitrate dissolved organic carbon and their concentrations here we report a study on the effects of cyclic changes in the chemical conditions on the rates of nitrate bioreduction in sediments from a hyporheic zone and the corresponding dynamics of the synthesis and decay of nitrate reductases the results indicated that the rate of nitrate bioreduction in the second and third cycles was faster than that in the first one because the nitrate reductases produced in the first cycle still partially maintained their reactivity the presence of do significantly decreased the rates of nitrate reduction and nitrate reductase synthesis but such an inhibition effect diminished in the later cycle the coupled changes in nitrate concentrations and functional enzymes and genes abundances were generally consistent with an enzyme based biogeochemical kinetic model overall the results indicated that enzyme growth dynamics and functions were complexly affected by the cyclic changes of environmental conditions and implied that hz sediments have a memory type system behavior in reducing nitrate that would be affected by the frequency and magnitude of groundwater and river water exchanges and chemical compositions in the groundwater and river water keywords hyporheic zone cyclic changes of chemical compositions nitrate bioreduction functional enzyme dynamics dissolved oxygen 1 introduction hyporheic zone hz is one of the most active biogeochemical domains in ecosystems that can strongly affect the water quality in both surface water and groundwater when river water level is higher than groundwater river water intrudes into the hz and the chemicals carried by river water change chemical compositions such as dissolved oxygen do nitrate dissolved organic carbon doc and their concentrations in the hz such changes in the hz would affect microbial community structure and functions danczak et al 2016 freixa et al 2016 liu et al 2017a b stoliker et al 2016 and corresponding biogeochemical reactions boano et al 2014 kaufman et al 2017 quick et al 2019 wong and williams 2010 the hydrodynamic changes are frequently observed in hz because the water levels of surface water or groundwater vary in response to raining dam drainage well pumping etc and that would lead to frequent changes in chemical composition in the hz fritz et al 2007 hester et al 2017 liu et al 2017b naganna and deka 2018 schaper et al 2018 singh et al 2019 vollmer et al 2002 the mechanisms how microbial community structure and functions in hz respond to such cyclic changes of chemical compositions in hz are still unclear danczak et al 2016 hester et al 2017 liu et al 2017b yang et al 2018 the links between microbial community functions and biogeochemical reaction rates in hz under such periodic varieties have not been well studied kristensen et al 1995 rocca et al 2014 singh et al 2019 xu et al 2017 nitrate reduction is the first step of denitrification and sensitive to concentration changes of do nitrate and doc besides nitrate reduction is also affected by other chemical components such as h2s nh4 fe etc kizewski et al 2019 martinelli et al 2018 pan et al 2019 nitrate can be reduced under anaerobic aerobic and micro aerobic conditions dalsgaard et al 2014 ji et al 2015 kornaros and lyberatos 1998 kraft et al 2011 marazioti et al 2003 robertson and kuenen 1984 however oxygen can inhibit the activity of nitrate reductases davies et al 1989 kampschreur et al 2009 patureau et al 1994 rivett et al 2008 stoliker et al 2016 nitrate reduction is catalyzed by periplasmic nitrate reductase napa and membrane bound nitrate reductase narg which are encoded by napa and narg genes respectively bru et al 2007 gonzalez et al 2006 kraft et al 2011 sparacino watkins et al 2014 napa enzyme is expressed anaerobically but also responsible for aerobic nitrate reduction because it does not depend on nitrate transport through the cytoplasmic membrane bell et al 1990 ji et al 2015 kraft et al 2011 moreno vivián et al 1999 sparacino watkins et al 2014 narg on the other hand is responsible for the majority of anaerobic nitrate reduction gonzalez et al 2006 moreno vivián et al 1999 under aerobiosis narg is not able to reduce nitrate because nitrate transport into the cytoplasm is inhibited by o2 denis et al 1990 fischer et al 2014 moir and wood 2001 the synthesis of nitrate reductases can also be inhibited by do körner and zumft 1989 that would affect the abundance of nitrate reductases and overall rate of nitrate reduction the inhibition of nitrate reduction rates by do therefore can result from both inhibited synthesis and activities of nitrate reductases it is however unclear the relative importance of these two inhibitions to nitrate reduction rates especially in dynamic hz environments where do concentration and redox conditions can change cyclically microorganisms may adapt to cyclic do concentration changes and the nitrate reductases produced in the former cycles may partially maintain their activities in later cycles even in presence of do so that hz sediments may exhibit a memory type behavior in reducing nitrate at system scale in this study we experimentally investigated the effects of cyclic changes of nitrate do and doc concentrations on the rates of nitrate bioreduction and corresponding nitrate reductase production and decay the research takes an advantage of a recently developed signature peptide based targeted mass spectrometry method with selected reaction monitoring approach that can efficiently and ultra sensitively quantify dissimilatory nitrate reducing enzymes in sediment samples li et al 2017a by measuring the enzyme concentration dynamics together with the measurements of their catalyzed biogeochemical reaction rates under conditions of the periodic changes of chemical compositions we can distinguish the relative importance of inhibited synthesis and activities of nitrate reductases to the rates of nitrate reduction a functional enzyme and gene based biogeochemical kinetic model was used to evaluate the changes in nitrate reduction rates and their coupling with functional enzyme dynamics under cyclic conditions of chemical compositions the results have a strong implication that the hz sediments would have a memory type behavior in reducing nitrate as a result of dynamic enzyme abundance changes in response to cyclic changes in chemical compositions 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment samples the sediment samples used in this study were collected from the columbia river hz at us doe hanford site where river water level varies daily due to the discharge from the upstream priest rapids dam the water flow direction and chemical composition in the hz change periodically as a result of river water level changes fritz et al 2007 liu et al 2017b the collected fresh sediment samples were sieved 2 mm and used for experiments as soon as possible as described below 2 2 experiments batch incubation experiments were performed at room temperature 22 c the fresh sieved sediment samples 5 g each vial calculated as dry weight were mixed with synthetic groundwater 50 ml in serum vials 160 ml the synthetic groundwater contains k na ca2 mg2 co3 2 hco3 no3 so4 2 and cl with ph 7 5 these ion concentrations mimic the multi year average levels of the ions in the hz pore water from all the wells at the sampling site table s1 multiple sediment suspension replicates were used to allow sacrificial sampling with time four sets of experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of cyclic changes of different chemical compositions on the dynamics of nitrate bioreduction 2 2 1 set 1 nitrate bioreduction with multiple spikes of nitrate in absence of oxygen sodium nitrate and sodium acetate solutions were injected into the sediment suspensions in the vials containing the hz sediment and synthetic groundwater with a final condition of 18 mmol l nitrate and 12 mmol l acetate in an anoxic chamber filled with n2 g innovative technology inc oldham acetate is used here as doc surrogate because it is commonly used as an organic electron donor in dissimilatory microbial reduction studies caccavo et al 1994 feng et al 2019 newsome et al 2020 acetate is also a good carbon source and an electron donor for denitrifying microorganisms cherchi et al 2009 hellman et al 2019 the sediment suspensions containing nitrate and acetate were then sealed by butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum caps and placed on a reciprocating platform shaker vwr international visalia ca at 120 rpm at select times three replicate vials were sacrificed and the suspensions were centrifuged to collect aqueous samples for determining dissolved nitrate nitrite acetate and dissolved inorganic carbon dic and to collect sediment samples for measuring nitrate reductases gene narg and napa and corresponding enzyme narg and napa after 3 days of bioreduction when the nitrate in the vials was completely exhausted nitrate and acetate were spiked again to start the second cycle of nitrate bioreduction a subset of sediment suspension vials were spiked with nitrate and acetate for starting the second cycle of nitrate bioreduction after 6 days of the first spike of nitrate and acetate this subset of the experiment allows evaluating the effect of time interval 3 days between the two cycles of nitrate bioreduction on the rate of nitrate bioreduction another subset of the vials were spiked with nitrate and acetate after 10 days of the first nitrate and acetate spike for starting the second cycle and were spiked with nitrate and acetate again after 12 4 days for the third cycle of nitrate bioreduction the sacrificed sampling procedure in these experiments was the same as for the first cycle 2 2 2 set 2 nitrate bioreduction with two spikes of nitrate and oxygen this set of the experiments were used to evaluate the effect of do on the rates of nitrate bioreduction and corresponding production and decay of nitrate reductases and genes the sediment and synthetic groundwater suspensions in the vials as described above were aerated with compressed air to saturate do in the suspensions the suspension vials were then sealed using butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum caps or rubber stoppers and plastic caps for vials with do meters followed by the spike of nitrate and acetate using a needle and syringe and then mixed on a reciprocating platform shaker vwr international ca at 120 rpm three sediment suspension vials were equipped with do meters to measure the changes of do concentration in the reactors during the experiment three other vials without a do meter were sacrificed at each select time for sampling and sample analyses nitrate was exhausted at the 9th day in this set of the experiments and then all the remaining sediment suspension vials and the vials equipped with do meters were opened and aerated with compressed air to saturate do again the do containing sediment suspensions vials were sealed and nitrate and acetate were spiked again with a needle and syringe to start the second cycle of nitrate bioreduction the sampling and sample analysis procedure was the same as for the first cycle above 2 2 3 set 3 nitrate bioreduction with two spikes of doc acetate this set of the experiments was to evaluate the effect of doc concentration change on the rate of nitrate reduction and corresponding nitrate reductase dynamics the experimental setup was the same as for set 2 experiment except that less acetate was spiked in the first cycle of nitrate bioreduction the remaining sediment suspension vials were spiked with acetate again at day 7 with a needle and syringe to measure nitrate bioreduction and corresponding dynamics of nitrate reductases and functional genes the sampling procedure was the same as for set 1 experiments 2 2 4 set 4 nitrate bioreduction switched from anaerobiosis to aerobiosis this set of the experiments were used to evaluate the effect of do and redox condition changes on the rate of nitrate reduction in this experiment sediment suspension vials were spiked with nitrate and acetate in absence of do in the first cycle of nitrate reduction as described for set 1 experiments when nitrate was exhausted near day 5 the remaining sediment suspension vials were opened and aerated with compressed air to saturate do the aerated vials were sealed and nitrate and acetate were spiked again with a needle and syringe to start the second cycle of nitrate bioreduction with do 2 3 chemical analysis dissolved nitrate nitrite and acetate were determined using dionex ics 2000 ion chromatography bannockburn il dic in aqueous samples was determined with a toc vcsh carbon analyzer with asi v auto sampler shimadzu kyoto do was assayed using a do meter oakton instruments vernon hills il additional details are reported previously li et al 2017b 2 4 functional gene analysis dna was extracted from the sediment samples collected during the nitrate reduction experiments using the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc san diego ca based on the manufacture s instruction the extracted dna was assayed with qubit assay kits thermofisher scientific inc waltham ma using a qubit 3 0 fluorometer thermofisher scientific inc functional genes napa and narg were measured using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr steponeplus real time pcr system applied biosystems inc waltham ma the results were reported as the gene copy number per ng dna additional details are reported previously li et al 2017b 2 5 reductase analysis nitrate reductases were analyzed using a targeted peptide approach as described elsewhere li et al 2017a briefly the peptides targeting nitrate reductases narg and napa were selected based on metaproteome data and their suitability for analysis the abundance of nitrate reductases was then determined based on the abundance of the targeted peptides to determine the abundance of the targeted peptides in the sediment samples collected from the nitrate reduction experiments the microbial cells in the sediments were lysed using sodium dodecyl sulfate tris buffer sigma aldrich st louis mo and the proteins in the lysed samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid sigma aldrich the precipitated proteins were washed with cold acetone and dried with n2 g and the formed protein pellets were re suspended in upx buffer expedeon inc san diego ca the suspended proteins were then centrifuged to remove undissolved particles the proteins in the supernatant were digested with fasp protein digestion kit expedeon inc the concentrations of the targeted peptides in the digested samples was measured using pierce bca protein assay kit thermofisher scientific inc rockford il the approaches of high pressure high resolution separations with intelligent selection and multiplexing prism srm were used to measure the concentrations of the targeted peptides as detailed elsewhere li et al 2017a shi et al 2012 which were then used to calculate nitrate reductases narg and napa abundance 2 6 model the functional enzyme based kinetic model li et al 2017b was used to describe nitrate bioreduction the model can simultaneously describe the coupled dynamics of functional enzymes and genes and biogeochemical reactions the simulated results were compared with the experimental results to assess the changes of nitrate reduction under cyclic conditions of nitrate concentration spikes the models simulation procedures and kinetic parameters were described elsewhere li et al 2017b and were also provided in supporting information and reaction parameters in table s2 for reference convenience simulations were only performed for the cases without do because the model and parameters were only calibrated for nitrate reduction bioreduction without do 3 results 3 1 nitrate bioreduction in response to cyclic nitrate concentration changes the pulse spikes of nitrate had significant effects on the rate of nitrate bioreduction and the corresponding nitrate reductase growth and decay fig 1 during the first pulse of nitrate spike nitrate bioreduction had an acclimation period of about 1 5 days followed by a quick decrease in nitrate concentration fig 1a nitrite and dic were produced as results of nitrate reduction and doc consumption figs 1a and b correspondingly the concentrations of napa and narg enzymes had an acclimation period of 1 5 days before they increased exponentially fig 1c more nitrate reductase narg was produced than napa fig 1c consistent with other reports that under anoxic condition narg was produced faster than napa and was primarily responsible for nitrate reduction gonzalez et al 2006 moreno vivián et al 1999 during the second cycle of nitrate bioreduction from day 3 the acclimation period of nitrate bioreduction disappeared indicating that the produced enzymes in the first cycle of the nitrate reduction was active and nitrate was reduced immediately after it was spiked again figs 1a and c the acetate consumption and dic production also confirmed that denitrifiers were active without an acclimation period in the second cycle figs 1a and b the enzyme concentrations however decreased with time in the second cycle of nitrate bioreduction likely reflecting the net effect of the decay of the enzymes produced in the first cycle of nitrate spike and new enzyme production during the second cycle of nitrate reduction unlike enzymes whose concentrations changed significantly with time the abundance of both genes napa and narg changed little and within one order of magnitude during the entire experiment fig 1c gene narg was about 2 orders of magnitude higher than gene napa consistent with other observations that narg was more abundant in anoxic samples gonzalez et al 2006 kraft et al 2011 the faster nitrate reduction after the second nitrate spike was also observed when the second nitrate spike occurred on day 6 after a 3 day period of no nitrate in the suspensions fig 2 a similar faster nitrate reduction in the later cycle of nitrate reduction was also observed in the case of three cycles of nitrate reduction fig 2b fig 2b showed that nitrate reduction in the third cycle was faster than that in the second cycle and was faster in the second cycle than that in the first cycle although the magnitude of the increase from the second to third cycle was less than that from the first to the second cycle the decrease in acetate concentration in the second and third nitrate spikes was consistent with nitrate reduction fig 2b nitrite concentration decreased during the time between the two cycles of nitrate spike figs 1a and 2a and after the exhaustion of nitrate in the third cycle of nitrate reduction fig 2b indicating that nitrite produced from nitrate reduction was reduced subsequently 3 2 inhibitory effects of do on nitrate bioreduction and reductases synthesis the presence of do in the sediment suspensions inhibited nitrate bioreduction fig 3 a in the first cycle of nitrate bioreduction nitrate started to be reduced after do concentration was less than 2 5 mg l once nitrate started reduction its concentration changed similarly as in the case in absence of do however its reduction rate was slower figs 1a 3a acetate concentration decreased and dic increased continuously with time figs 3a and b reflecting that do and nitrate were consumed as the electron acceptors nitrate bioreduction in the first cycle ended at day 9 in the second cycle nitrate reduction still had a lag phase fig 3a although the lag phase was shorter than that in the first cycle the rate of do concentration decrease was faster in the second cycle when do concentration was about 2 5 mg l nitrate started reduction in the second cycle the similar do threshold value of 2 5 mg l in the first and second cycles of nitrate reduction was interesting and might be used for modeling nitrate reduction in systems with do inhibition nitrite was not accumulated in the two cycles of nitrate reduction indicating that nitrite produced from the nitrate reduction was consumed quickly the result suggests that the rate of nitrite reduction was not inhibited by do lee et al 2010 consistent with the changes in nitrate reduction rate the acetate concentration decreased and dic increased faster in the second cycle of nitrate and do reduction fig 3b nitrate reductases narg and napa were slowly synthesized before day 2 despite that do was present and nitrate reduction was negligible fig 3c after day 2 the synthesis rates of both narg and napa enzymes increased however their synthesis rates were much slower than those in the case without do fig 1c leading to lower abundance of these enzymes and thus a lower rate of nitrate reduction figs 1a and 3a the results indicated the inhibitory effect of do on the synthesis of nitrate reductases the two enzymes decayed at the end of the first cycle of nitrate reduction followed by a faster synthesis rate in the second cycle that was consistent with nitrate concentration changes gene napa and narg increased slightly but within the same order of magnitude consistent with the case without do fig 1c 3 3 effects of dissolved organic carbon on nitrate reduction and reductases synthesis the amount of dissolved organic carbon acetate had a strong effect on the synthesis of nitrate reductases and the rate of nitrate bioreduction fig 4 in the first spike of acetate acetate was primarily used for the reduction of do and nitrate was reduced little fig 4a however nitrate reductases were synthesized although the synthesis rate was much slower than that in the case without organic carbon limitation fig 3 after the second spike of acetate nitrate reduction became faster with the active reductases produced previously and a corresponding rate of nitrate reductase synthesis the dic production was consistent with the consumption of acetate fig 4b the reductase abundance started to decrease before nitrate exhausted indicating that the enzyme decay was faster than its production likely as a result of the faster decay of the enzymes produced during the first cycle than that produced in the second cycle the profiles of gene napa and narg changed less as with the case without acetate limitation fig 1c 3 4 effects of redox condition changes on nitrate reduction and reductases synthesis when the anoxic reduction of nitrate in the first cycle switched to the oxic one via spiking do and nitrate in the second cycle nitrate was reduced even in presence of do fig 5 a which indicated that nitrate reductases synthesized in the anoxic cycle were reactive in presence of do however the nitrate reduction rate decreased in the second cycle as compared to the anoxic case fig 1a indicating that do inhibited partial activity of nitrate reductases these results were consistent with that napa enzyme could catalyze nitrate reduction in presence of oxygen but narg enzyme could not do it bell et al 1990 gonzalez et al 2006 ji et al 2015 kraft et al 2011 moreno vivián et al 1999 sparacino watkins et al 2014 narg on the other hand is responsible for the majority of anaerobic nitrate reduction in fig 5a when do concentration decreased to about 2 5 mg l and nitrate and acetate concentrations were not limiting nitrate reduction accelerated the increasing of dic production rate also confirmed this fig 5b 3 5 model results the modeling results of nitrate reduction with cyclic spikes of nitrate in absence of oxygen matched well with the experimental results from figs 1 and 2 indicating that the enzyme based model can simulate the kinetics of nitrate reduction process under dynamic environments the results confirmed that the fast rate of nitrate reduction was in the later cycles was due to the presence of nitrate reductase synthesis in the previous cycles 4 discussion 4 1 oxygen inhibition of nitrate reductase synthesis and nitrate bioreduction oxygen can suppress the synthesis of denitrifying enzymes and inhibit the activity of nitrate reductases davies et al 1989 kampschreur et al 2009 patureau et al 1994 our results were generally consistent with these previous observations in addition our results indicated that the oxygen inhibition was primarily on the synthesis of narg because its synthesis rate and abundance decreased significantly in presence of do when compared with napa enzyme figs 1c and 3c napa is responsible for aerobic nitrate reduction because of its location in periplasm bell et al 1990 ji et al 2015 moreno vivián et al 1999 sparacino watkins et al 2014 while narg cannot reduce nitrate in presence of do gonzalez et al 2006 moreno vivián et al 1999 herein both napa and narg enzymes were observed to be produced and increased with time before the exhaustion of do figs 3c 4c the growth of narg enzyme perhaps was from biomass growth as the cell split the abundance of narg increased the slight increase of narg gene with time was consistent with this explanation however whether the narg catalyzed nitrate reduction or not in presence of do was uncertain because the system also contained napa that would be entirely responsible for the nitrate reduction in presence of oxygen napa and narg enzyme function was consistent with the result that the nitrate reductases produced in anoxic condition reduced nitrate when do was in presence fig 5 4 2 dynamic changes of enzyme concentrations and corresponding biogeochemical reaction rates in changing environments environmental conditions such as the concentrations of electron donors and acceptors redox conditions nutrients etc often change in natural systems such as in the hz the frequent reversal of water flow directions in the hz can lead to the frequent changes in hz chemical compositions this study using nitrate reduction as an example indicated that the abundance of functional enzymes and nitrate reduction rates changed dynamically in response to the changes in chemical compositions the functional enzymes synthesized during the previous cycle of nitrate reduction can shorten the acclimation time and increase the rate of nitrate reduction even under presence of oxygen figs 1 5 the changes in functional genes which are often used to indicate microbial community composition were much less indicating that microbial community will likely have a stable structure while its functions can quickly adapt to the dynamic changes in environments liu et al 2017a at the system level these results implied that hz sediment has a biogeochemical functional memory behavior that the system behavior at the first cycle will affect the behavior at the later cycle however such a memory type system behavior may depend on time interval between two cycles because the enzymes produced in the previous cycles which are responsible for the memory type behavior in reducing nitrate will decay with time the dynamic linkage between enzymes and biogeochemical reaction rates was complex figs 1 5 the frequency and magnitude of the changes in nitrate and doc concentrations the time intervals between the pulses of nitrate and organic carbon supplies and especially do as a common competitive electron acceptor can all affect the synthesis and decay of functional enzymes and corresponding biogeochemical reaction rates an enzyme based model has been proposed to describe such a complex relationship li et al 2017b the model explicitly considers functional enzymes as the direct linking variables between microbial community functions and biogeochemical reactions the results of the dynamic changes in nitrate reductase abundance and nitrate reduction rates supported such type of models other models exist that often use biomass as the surrogates in catalyzing biogeochemical reactions monod 1949 orhon et al 2009 wang et al 2016 the functional biomass is often difficult to measure in natural systems and thus functional genes were proposed to replace functional biomass as the surrogates for enzymes in some biogeochemical models reed et al 2014 the results in this study indicated that functional genes were relatively stable that were not sensitive to the changes in chemical compositions the results in fig 6 showed a case of the application of the enzyme based model in describing nitrate reduction using the same set of rate parameters as provided previously li et al 2017b the simulation results matched well with the experimental results in all cycles of nitrate reduction under anoxic case indicating that the enzyme based model can simulate the kinetics of nitrate reduction process under dynamic environments the model was only calibrated under conditions without oxygen consequently only results in figs 1 and 2 were simulated further work is needed for extending the model to the cases with competitive electron acceptors such as oxygen our finding that 2 5 mg l of do as a threshold might be used as a switch for turning on nitrate reduction in simulation when both do and nitrate exist in the environment 5 conclusions cyclic changes in chemical compositions are common in aquatic systems such as in hz wetland and groundwater table fluctuation zones as a result of surface water or groundwater level changes this study indicated that the rates of biogeochemical reactions such as nitrate reduction were a function of cyclic changes in chemical compositions showing a memory type system behavior the later cycle of nitrate reduction was faster with a shorter acclimation period due to the presence of the corresponding enzymes produced in the previous cycle even in presence of do the memory type system behavior was complexly affected by the frequency and magnitude of chemical composition changes the time interval between the change cycles and the chemical compositions in the environment a key to understand and simulate such a system behavior is the dynamics of functional enzymes that was complexly linked with the rates of biogeochemical reactions the functional genes which are often used to indicate microbial community structures were less sensitive to the chemical composition changes do in aquatic systems can inhibit nitrate reduction by inhibiting the synthesis of nitrate reductases and also decreased the rates of the enzyme activity our results supported that the presence of do primarily affects the synthesis and activity of narg while the effect to napa was much less in addition this study found that the cyclic changes in environmental conditions can diminish the inhibitory effect of do because the nitrate reductases produced in the previous cycles can partially maintain their activities in the later cycles such a result has a strong implication to the microbially mediated transformation of contaminants such as nitrate in environments and to the cycling of elements such as carbon and nitrogen in aquatic systems at last the results came from the laboratory incubation experiments which were helpful in understanding the state of hyporheic zone in nature but that caution should be exercised when transferring these results to the natural

5584,hyporheic zone hz is the hotspot of contaminant biotransformation in ecosystems that affects water quality in both groundwater and river water hz is characterized by its dynamic changes in water flow direction that lead to the cyclic changes in aqueous chemical compositions such as dissolved oxygen do nitrate dissolved organic carbon and their concentrations here we report a study on the effects of cyclic changes in the chemical conditions on the rates of nitrate bioreduction in sediments from a hyporheic zone and the corresponding dynamics of the synthesis and decay of nitrate reductases the results indicated that the rate of nitrate bioreduction in the second and third cycles was faster than that in the first one because the nitrate reductases produced in the first cycle still partially maintained their reactivity the presence of do significantly decreased the rates of nitrate reduction and nitrate reductase synthesis but such an inhibition effect diminished in the later cycle the coupled changes in nitrate concentrations and functional enzymes and genes abundances were generally consistent with an enzyme based biogeochemical kinetic model overall the results indicated that enzyme growth dynamics and functions were complexly affected by the cyclic changes of environmental conditions and implied that hz sediments have a memory type system behavior in reducing nitrate that would be affected by the frequency and magnitude of groundwater and river water exchanges and chemical compositions in the groundwater and river water keywords hyporheic zone cyclic changes of chemical compositions nitrate bioreduction functional enzyme dynamics dissolved oxygen 1 introduction hyporheic zone hz is one of the most active biogeochemical domains in ecosystems that can strongly affect the water quality in both surface water and groundwater when river water level is higher than groundwater river water intrudes into the hz and the chemicals carried by river water change chemical compositions such as dissolved oxygen do nitrate dissolved organic carbon doc and their concentrations in the hz such changes in the hz would affect microbial community structure and functions danczak et al 2016 freixa et al 2016 liu et al 2017a b stoliker et al 2016 and corresponding biogeochemical reactions boano et al 2014 kaufman et al 2017 quick et al 2019 wong and williams 2010 the hydrodynamic changes are frequently observed in hz because the water levels of surface water or groundwater vary in response to raining dam drainage well pumping etc and that would lead to frequent changes in chemical composition in the hz fritz et al 2007 hester et al 2017 liu et al 2017b naganna and deka 2018 schaper et al 2018 singh et al 2019 vollmer et al 2002 the mechanisms how microbial community structure and functions in hz respond to such cyclic changes of chemical compositions in hz are still unclear danczak et al 2016 hester et al 2017 liu et al 2017b yang et al 2018 the links between microbial community functions and biogeochemical reaction rates in hz under such periodic varieties have not been well studied kristensen et al 1995 rocca et al 2014 singh et al 2019 xu et al 2017 nitrate reduction is the first step of denitrification and sensitive to concentration changes of do nitrate and doc besides nitrate reduction is also affected by other chemical components such as h2s nh4 fe etc kizewski et al 2019 martinelli et al 2018 pan et al 2019 nitrate can be reduced under anaerobic aerobic and micro aerobic conditions dalsgaard et al 2014 ji et al 2015 kornaros and lyberatos 1998 kraft et al 2011 marazioti et al 2003 robertson and kuenen 1984 however oxygen can inhibit the activity of nitrate reductases davies et al 1989 kampschreur et al 2009 patureau et al 1994 rivett et al 2008 stoliker et al 2016 nitrate reduction is catalyzed by periplasmic nitrate reductase napa and membrane bound nitrate reductase narg which are encoded by napa and narg genes respectively bru et al 2007 gonzalez et al 2006 kraft et al 2011 sparacino watkins et al 2014 napa enzyme is expressed anaerobically but also responsible for aerobic nitrate reduction because it does not depend on nitrate transport through the cytoplasmic membrane bell et al 1990 ji et al 2015 kraft et al 2011 moreno vivián et al 1999 sparacino watkins et al 2014 narg on the other hand is responsible for the majority of anaerobic nitrate reduction gonzalez et al 2006 moreno vivián et al 1999 under aerobiosis narg is not able to reduce nitrate because nitrate transport into the cytoplasm is inhibited by o2 denis et al 1990 fischer et al 2014 moir and wood 2001 the synthesis of nitrate reductases can also be inhibited by do körner and zumft 1989 that would affect the abundance of nitrate reductases and overall rate of nitrate reduction the inhibition of nitrate reduction rates by do therefore can result from both inhibited synthesis and activities of nitrate reductases it is however unclear the relative importance of these two inhibitions to nitrate reduction rates especially in dynamic hz environments where do concentration and redox conditions can change cyclically microorganisms may adapt to cyclic do concentration changes and the nitrate reductases produced in the former cycles may partially maintain their activities in later cycles even in presence of do so that hz sediments may exhibit a memory type behavior in reducing nitrate at system scale in this study we experimentally investigated the effects of cyclic changes of nitrate do and doc concentrations on the rates of nitrate bioreduction and corresponding nitrate reductase production and decay the research takes an advantage of a recently developed signature peptide based targeted mass spectrometry method with selected reaction monitoring approach that can efficiently and ultra sensitively quantify dissimilatory nitrate reducing enzymes in sediment samples li et al 2017a by measuring the enzyme concentration dynamics together with the measurements of their catalyzed biogeochemical reaction rates under conditions of the periodic changes of chemical compositions we can distinguish the relative importance of inhibited synthesis and activities of nitrate reductases to the rates of nitrate reduction a functional enzyme and gene based biogeochemical kinetic model was used to evaluate the changes in nitrate reduction rates and their coupling with functional enzyme dynamics under cyclic conditions of chemical compositions the results have a strong implication that the hz sediments would have a memory type behavior in reducing nitrate as a result of dynamic enzyme abundance changes in response to cyclic changes in chemical compositions 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment samples the sediment samples used in this study were collected from the columbia river hz at us doe hanford site where river water level varies daily due to the discharge from the upstream priest rapids dam the water flow direction and chemical composition in the hz change periodically as a result of river water level changes fritz et al 2007 liu et al 2017b the collected fresh sediment samples were sieved 2 mm and used for experiments as soon as possible as described below 2 2 experiments batch incubation experiments were performed at room temperature 22 c the fresh sieved sediment samples 5 g each vial calculated as dry weight were mixed with synthetic groundwater 50 ml in serum vials 160 ml the synthetic groundwater contains k na ca2 mg2 co3 2 hco3 no3 so4 2 and cl with ph 7 5 these ion concentrations mimic the multi year average levels of the ions in the hz pore water from all the wells at the sampling site table s1 multiple sediment suspension replicates were used to allow sacrificial sampling with time four sets of experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of cyclic changes of different chemical compositions on the dynamics of nitrate bioreduction 2 2 1 set 1 nitrate bioreduction with multiple spikes of nitrate in absence of oxygen sodium nitrate and sodium acetate solutions were injected into the sediment suspensions in the vials containing the hz sediment and synthetic groundwater with a final condition of 18 mmol l nitrate and 12 mmol l acetate in an anoxic chamber filled with n2 g innovative technology inc oldham acetate is used here as doc surrogate because it is commonly used as an organic electron donor in dissimilatory microbial reduction studies caccavo et al 1994 feng et al 2019 newsome et al 2020 acetate is also a good carbon source and an electron donor for denitrifying microorganisms cherchi et al 2009 hellman et al 2019 the sediment suspensions containing nitrate and acetate were then sealed by butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum caps and placed on a reciprocating platform shaker vwr international visalia ca at 120 rpm at select times three replicate vials were sacrificed and the suspensions were centrifuged to collect aqueous samples for determining dissolved nitrate nitrite acetate and dissolved inorganic carbon dic and to collect sediment samples for measuring nitrate reductases gene narg and napa and corresponding enzyme narg and napa after 3 days of bioreduction when the nitrate in the vials was completely exhausted nitrate and acetate were spiked again to start the second cycle of nitrate bioreduction a subset of sediment suspension vials were spiked with nitrate and acetate for starting the second cycle of nitrate bioreduction after 6 days of the first spike of nitrate and acetate this subset of the experiment allows evaluating the effect of time interval 3 days between the two cycles of nitrate bioreduction on the rate of nitrate bioreduction another subset of the vials were spiked with nitrate and acetate after 10 days of the first nitrate and acetate spike for starting the second cycle and were spiked with nitrate and acetate again after 12 4 days for the third cycle of nitrate bioreduction the sacrificed sampling procedure in these experiments was the same as for the first cycle 2 2 2 set 2 nitrate bioreduction with two spikes of nitrate and oxygen this set of the experiments were used to evaluate the effect of do on the rates of nitrate bioreduction and corresponding production and decay of nitrate reductases and genes the sediment and synthetic groundwater suspensions in the vials as described above were aerated with compressed air to saturate do in the suspensions the suspension vials were then sealed using butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum caps or rubber stoppers and plastic caps for vials with do meters followed by the spike of nitrate and acetate using a needle and syringe and then mixed on a reciprocating platform shaker vwr international ca at 120 rpm three sediment suspension vials were equipped with do meters to measure the changes of do concentration in the reactors during the experiment three other vials without a do meter were sacrificed at each select time for sampling and sample analyses nitrate was exhausted at the 9th day in this set of the experiments and then all the remaining sediment suspension vials and the vials equipped with do meters were opened and aerated with compressed air to saturate do again the do containing sediment suspensions vials were sealed and nitrate and acetate were spiked again with a needle and syringe to start the second cycle of nitrate bioreduction the sampling and sample analysis procedure was the same as for the first cycle above 2 2 3 set 3 nitrate bioreduction with two spikes of doc acetate this set of the experiments was to evaluate the effect of doc concentration change on the rate of nitrate reduction and corresponding nitrate reductase dynamics the experimental setup was the same as for set 2 experiment except that less acetate was spiked in the first cycle of nitrate bioreduction the remaining sediment suspension vials were spiked with acetate again at day 7 with a needle and syringe to measure nitrate bioreduction and corresponding dynamics of nitrate reductases and functional genes the sampling procedure was the same as for set 1 experiments 2 2 4 set 4 nitrate bioreduction switched from anaerobiosis to aerobiosis this set of the experiments were used to evaluate the effect of do and redox condition changes on the rate of nitrate reduction in this experiment sediment suspension vials were spiked with nitrate and acetate in absence of do in the first cycle of nitrate reduction as described for set 1 experiments when nitrate was exhausted near day 5 the remaining sediment suspension vials were opened and aerated with compressed air to saturate do the aerated vials were sealed and nitrate and acetate were spiked again with a needle and syringe to start the second cycle of nitrate bioreduction with do 2 3 chemical analysis dissolved nitrate nitrite and acetate were determined using dionex ics 2000 ion chromatography bannockburn il dic in aqueous samples was determined with a toc vcsh carbon analyzer with asi v auto sampler shimadzu kyoto do was assayed using a do meter oakton instruments vernon hills il additional details are reported previously li et al 2017b 2 4 functional gene analysis dna was extracted from the sediment samples collected during the nitrate reduction experiments using the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc san diego ca based on the manufacture s instruction the extracted dna was assayed with qubit assay kits thermofisher scientific inc waltham ma using a qubit 3 0 fluorometer thermofisher scientific inc functional genes napa and narg were measured using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr steponeplus real time pcr system applied biosystems inc waltham ma the results were reported as the gene copy number per ng dna additional details are reported previously li et al 2017b 2 5 reductase analysis nitrate reductases were analyzed using a targeted peptide approach as described elsewhere li et al 2017a briefly the peptides targeting nitrate reductases narg and napa were selected based on metaproteome data and their suitability for analysis the abundance of nitrate reductases was then determined based on the abundance of the targeted peptides to determine the abundance of the targeted peptides in the sediment samples collected from the nitrate reduction experiments the microbial cells in the sediments were lysed using sodium dodecyl sulfate tris buffer sigma aldrich st louis mo and the proteins in the lysed samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid sigma aldrich the precipitated proteins were washed with cold acetone and dried with n2 g and the formed protein pellets were re suspended in upx buffer expedeon inc san diego ca the suspended proteins were then centrifuged to remove undissolved particles the proteins in the supernatant were digested with fasp protein digestion kit expedeon inc the concentrations of the targeted peptides in the digested samples was measured using pierce bca protein assay kit thermofisher scientific inc rockford il the approaches of high pressure high resolution separations with intelligent selection and multiplexing prism srm were used to measure the concentrations of the targeted peptides as detailed elsewhere li et al 2017a shi et al 2012 which were then used to calculate nitrate reductases narg and napa abundance 2 6 model the functional enzyme based kinetic model li et al 2017b was used to describe nitrate bioreduction the model can simultaneously describe the coupled dynamics of functional enzymes and genes and biogeochemical reactions the simulated results were compared with the experimental results to assess the changes of nitrate reduction under cyclic conditions of nitrate concentration spikes the models simulation procedures and kinetic parameters were described elsewhere li et al 2017b and were also provided in supporting information and reaction parameters in table s2 for reference convenience simulations were only performed for the cases without do because the model and parameters were only calibrated for nitrate reduction bioreduction without do 3 results 3 1 nitrate bioreduction in response to cyclic nitrate concentration changes the pulse spikes of nitrate had significant effects on the rate of nitrate bioreduction and the corresponding nitrate reductase growth and decay fig 1 during the first pulse of nitrate spike nitrate bioreduction had an acclimation period of about 1 5 days followed by a quick decrease in nitrate concentration fig 1a nitrite and dic were produced as results of nitrate reduction and doc consumption figs 1a and b correspondingly the concentrations of napa and narg enzymes had an acclimation period of 1 5 days before they increased exponentially fig 1c more nitrate reductase narg was produced than napa fig 1c consistent with other reports that under anoxic condition narg was produced faster than napa and was primarily responsible for nitrate reduction gonzalez et al 2006 moreno vivián et al 1999 during the second cycle of nitrate bioreduction from day 3 the acclimation period of nitrate bioreduction disappeared indicating that the produced enzymes in the first cycle of the nitrate reduction was active and nitrate was reduced immediately after it was spiked again figs 1a and c the acetate consumption and dic production also confirmed that denitrifiers were active without an acclimation period in the second cycle figs 1a and b the enzyme concentrations however decreased with time in the second cycle of nitrate bioreduction likely reflecting the net effect of the decay of the enzymes produced in the first cycle of nitrate spike and new enzyme production during the second cycle of nitrate reduction unlike enzymes whose concentrations changed significantly with time the abundance of both genes napa and narg changed little and within one order of magnitude during the entire experiment fig 1c gene narg was about 2 orders of magnitude higher than gene napa consistent with other observations that narg was more abundant in anoxic samples gonzalez et al 2006 kraft et al 2011 the faster nitrate reduction after the second nitrate spike was also observed when the second nitrate spike occurred on day 6 after a 3 day period of no nitrate in the suspensions fig 2 a similar faster nitrate reduction in the later cycle of nitrate reduction was also observed in the case of three cycles of nitrate reduction fig 2b fig 2b showed that nitrate reduction in the third cycle was faster than that in the second cycle and was faster in the second cycle than that in the first cycle although the magnitude of the increase from the second to third cycle was less than that from the first to the second cycle the decrease in acetate concentration in the second and third nitrate spikes was consistent with nitrate reduction fig 2b nitrite concentration decreased during the time between the two cycles of nitrate spike figs 1a and 2a and after the exhaustion of nitrate in the third cycle of nitrate reduction fig 2b indicating that nitrite produced from nitrate reduction was reduced subsequently 3 2 inhibitory effects of do on nitrate bioreduction and reductases synthesis the presence of do in the sediment suspensions inhibited nitrate bioreduction fig 3 a in the first cycle of nitrate bioreduction nitrate started to be reduced after do concentration was less than 2 5 mg l once nitrate started reduction its concentration changed similarly as in the case in absence of do however its reduction rate was slower figs 1a 3a acetate concentration decreased and dic increased continuously with time figs 3a and b reflecting that do and nitrate were consumed as the electron acceptors nitrate bioreduction in the first cycle ended at day 9 in the second cycle nitrate reduction still had a lag phase fig 3a although the lag phase was shorter than that in the first cycle the rate of do concentration decrease was faster in the second cycle when do concentration was about 2 5 mg l nitrate started reduction in the second cycle the similar do threshold value of 2 5 mg l in the first and second cycles of nitrate reduction was interesting and might be used for modeling nitrate reduction in systems with do inhibition nitrite was not accumulated in the two cycles of nitrate reduction indicating that nitrite produced from the nitrate reduction was consumed quickly the result suggests that the rate of nitrite reduction was not inhibited by do lee et al 2010 consistent with the changes in nitrate reduction rate the acetate concentration decreased and dic increased faster in the second cycle of nitrate and do reduction fig 3b nitrate reductases narg and napa were slowly synthesized before day 2 despite that do was present and nitrate reduction was negligible fig 3c after day 2 the synthesis rates of both narg and napa enzymes increased however their synthesis rates were much slower than those in the case without do fig 1c leading to lower abundance of these enzymes and thus a lower rate of nitrate reduction figs 1a and 3a the results indicated the inhibitory effect of do on the synthesis of nitrate reductases the two enzymes decayed at the end of the first cycle of nitrate reduction followed by a faster synthesis rate in the second cycle that was consistent with nitrate concentration changes gene napa and narg increased slightly but within the same order of magnitude consistent with the case without do fig 1c 3 3 effects of dissolved organic carbon on nitrate reduction and reductases synthesis the amount of dissolved organic carbon acetate had a strong effect on the synthesis of nitrate reductases and the rate of nitrate bioreduction fig 4 in the first spike of acetate acetate was primarily used for the reduction of do and nitrate was reduced little fig 4a however nitrate reductases were synthesized although the synthesis rate was much slower than that in the case without organic carbon limitation fig 3 after the second spike of acetate nitrate reduction became faster with the active reductases produced previously and a corresponding rate of nitrate reductase synthesis the dic production was consistent with the consumption of acetate fig 4b the reductase abundance started to decrease before nitrate exhausted indicating that the enzyme decay was faster than its production likely as a result of the faster decay of the enzymes produced during the first cycle than that produced in the second cycle the profiles of gene napa and narg changed less as with the case without acetate limitation fig 1c 3 4 effects of redox condition changes on nitrate reduction and reductases synthesis when the anoxic reduction of nitrate in the first cycle switched to the oxic one via spiking do and nitrate in the second cycle nitrate was reduced even in presence of do fig 5 a which indicated that nitrate reductases synthesized in the anoxic cycle were reactive in presence of do however the nitrate reduction rate decreased in the second cycle as compared to the anoxic case fig 1a indicating that do inhibited partial activity of nitrate reductases these results were consistent with that napa enzyme could catalyze nitrate reduction in presence of oxygen but narg enzyme could not do it bell et al 1990 gonzalez et al 2006 ji et al 2015 kraft et al 2011 moreno vivián et al 1999 sparacino watkins et al 2014 narg on the other hand is responsible for the majority of anaerobic nitrate reduction in fig 5a when do concentration decreased to about 2 5 mg l and nitrate and acetate concentrations were not limiting nitrate reduction accelerated the increasing of dic production rate also confirmed this fig 5b 3 5 model results the modeling results of nitrate reduction with cyclic spikes of nitrate in absence of oxygen matched well with the experimental results from figs 1 and 2 indicating that the enzyme based model can simulate the kinetics of nitrate reduction process under dynamic environments the results confirmed that the fast rate of nitrate reduction was in the later cycles was due to the presence of nitrate reductase synthesis in the previous cycles 4 discussion 4 1 oxygen inhibition of nitrate reductase synthesis and nitrate bioreduction oxygen can suppress the synthesis of denitrifying enzymes and inhibit the activity of nitrate reductases davies et al 1989 kampschreur et al 2009 patureau et al 1994 our results were generally consistent with these previous observations in addition our results indicated that the oxygen inhibition was primarily on the synthesis of narg because its synthesis rate and abundance decreased significantly in presence of do when compared with napa enzyme figs 1c and 3c napa is responsible for aerobic nitrate reduction because of its location in periplasm bell et al 1990 ji et al 2015 moreno vivián et al 1999 sparacino watkins et al 2014 while narg cannot reduce nitrate in presence of do gonzalez et al 2006 moreno vivián et al 1999 herein both napa and narg enzymes were observed to be produced and increased with time before the exhaustion of do figs 3c 4c the growth of narg enzyme perhaps was from biomass growth as the cell split the abundance of narg increased the slight increase of narg gene with time was consistent with this explanation however whether the narg catalyzed nitrate reduction or not in presence of do was uncertain because the system also contained napa that would be entirely responsible for the nitrate reduction in presence of oxygen napa and narg enzyme function was consistent with the result that the nitrate reductases produced in anoxic condition reduced nitrate when do was in presence fig 5 4 2 dynamic changes of enzyme concentrations and corresponding biogeochemical reaction rates in changing environments environmental conditions such as the concentrations of electron donors and acceptors redox conditions nutrients etc often change in natural systems such as in the hz the frequent reversal of water flow directions in the hz can lead to the frequent changes in hz chemical compositions this study using nitrate reduction as an example indicated that the abundance of functional enzymes and nitrate reduction rates changed dynamically in response to the changes in chemical compositions the functional enzymes synthesized during the previous cycle of nitrate reduction can shorten the acclimation time and increase the rate of nitrate reduction even under presence of oxygen figs 1 5 the changes in functional genes which are often used to indicate microbial community composition were much less indicating that microbial community will likely have a stable structure while its functions can quickly adapt to the dynamic changes in environments liu et al 2017a at the system level these results implied that hz sediment has a biogeochemical functional memory behavior that the system behavior at the first cycle will affect the behavior at the later cycle however such a memory type system behavior may depend on time interval between two cycles because the enzymes produced in the previous cycles which are responsible for the memory type behavior in reducing nitrate will decay with time the dynamic linkage between enzymes and biogeochemical reaction rates was complex figs 1 5 the frequency and magnitude of the changes in nitrate and doc concentrations the time intervals between the pulses of nitrate and organic carbon supplies and especially do as a common competitive electron acceptor can all affect the synthesis and decay of functional enzymes and corresponding biogeochemical reaction rates an enzyme based model has been proposed to describe such a complex relationship li et al 2017b the model explicitly considers functional enzymes as the direct linking variables between microbial community functions and biogeochemical reactions the results of the dynamic changes in nitrate reductase abundance and nitrate reduction rates supported such type of models other models exist that often use biomass as the surrogates in catalyzing biogeochemical reactions monod 1949 orhon et al 2009 wang et al 2016 the functional biomass is often difficult to measure in natural systems and thus functional genes were proposed to replace functional biomass as the surrogates for enzymes in some biogeochemical models reed et al 2014 the results in this study indicated that functional genes were relatively stable that were not sensitive to the changes in chemical compositions the results in fig 6 showed a case of the application of the enzyme based model in describing nitrate reduction using the same set of rate parameters as provided previously li et al 2017b the simulation results matched well with the experimental results in all cycles of nitrate reduction under anoxic case indicating that the enzyme based model can simulate the kinetics of nitrate reduction process under dynamic environments the model was only calibrated under conditions without oxygen consequently only results in figs 1 and 2 were simulated further work is needed for extending the model to the cases with competitive electron acceptors such as oxygen our finding that 2 5 mg l of do as a threshold might be used as a switch for turning on nitrate reduction in simulation when both do and nitrate exist in the environment 5 conclusions cyclic changes in chemical compositions are common in aquatic systems such as in hz wetland and groundwater table fluctuation zones as a result of surface water or groundwater level changes this study indicated that the rates of biogeochemical reactions such as nitrate reduction were a function of cyclic changes in chemical compositions showing a memory type system behavior the later cycle of nitrate reduction was faster with a shorter acclimation period due to the presence of the corresponding enzymes produced in the previous cycle even in presence of do the memory type system behavior was complexly affected by the frequency and magnitude of chemical composition changes the time interval between the change cycles and the chemical compositions in the environment a key to understand and simulate such a system behavior is the dynamics of functional enzymes that was complexly linked with the rates of biogeochemical reactions the functional genes which are often used to indicate microbial community structures were less sensitive to the chemical composition changes do in aquatic systems can inhibit nitrate reduction by inhibiting the synthesis of nitrate reductases and also decreased the rates of the enzyme activity our results supported that the presence of do primarily affects the synthesis and activity of narg while the effect to napa was much less in addition this study found that the cyclic changes in environmental conditions can diminish the inhibitory effect of do because the nitrate reductases produced in the previous cycles can partially maintain their activities in the later cycles such a result has a strong implication to the microbially mediated transformation of contaminants such as nitrate in environments and to the cycling of elements such as carbon and nitrogen in aquatic systems at last the results came from the laboratory incubation experiments which were helpful in understanding the state of hyporheic zone in nature but that caution should be exercised when transferring these results to the natural hyporheic zone credit authorship contribution statement minjing li conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft writing review editing visualization rong li software formal
