17910,the world s longest trans basin water diversion project the middle route mr of the south to north water diversion project of china snwdpc has officially been in operation for over 5 years since december 2014 its water quality status has always attracted special attention because it is related to the health and safety of more than 58 million people and the integrity of an ecosystem covering more than 155 000 km2 this study presented and analysed the spatio temporal variations and trends of 16 water quality parameters including ph water temperature wt dissolved oxygen do permanganate index pi five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 fecal coliform f coli total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh3 n sulphate so4 2 fluoride f mercury hg arsenic as selenium se copper cu and zinc zn which were determined monthly from samples collected at 27 water quality monitoring stations in the mr of the snwdpc from march 2016 to february 2019 the water quality index wqi was used to evaluate the seasonal and spatial water quality changes during the monitoring period and a new wqimin model consisting of five crucial parameters i e tp f coli hg wt and do was built by using stepwise multiple linear regression analysis the results demonstrated that the water quality status of the mr of the snwdpc has been steadily maintained at an excellent level during the monitoring period with an overall average wqi value of 90 39 and twelve seasonal mean wqi values ranging from 87 67 to 91 82 the proposed wqimin model that uses the selected five key parameters and the weights of those parameters has exhibited excellent performance in the water quality assessment of the project with the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and percentage error pe values of 0 901 2 21 1 93 respectively showing that the proposed wqimin model is a useful and efficient tool to evaluate and manage the water quality for the management department the risk sources near certain stations with abnormally high values should be carefully inspected and strictly managed to maintain excellent water quality the potential risks of algae proliferation in this project should be of concern in future research graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality index water quality assessment parameters selection the south to north water diversion project of china stepwise multiple linear regression 1 introduction adequate and high quality water is one of the most important foundations for the healthy and sustainable development of human society and ecosystems vorosmarty et al 2010 with the considerable growth of the world population and the rapid development of urbanization in developing countries many hydraulic engineering projects have been built to meet the water consumption demands for domestic drinking industrial production and agricultural irrigation niu et al 2019 while connecting and allocating rivers lakes sea and other water resources for human use hydraulic projects also make the water quality issues faced by human beings more intricate than ever before bayram et al 2014 these projects such as dams reservoirs and water supply canals have changed water basin environments and have impacted land use plant structures and population densities factors that can cause the water quality to be complicated putro et al 2016 todd et al 2012 in particular the deterioration of water quality has become global issues and occurred in various hydraulic projects over the past decades crossetti et al 2008 and the controversies and studies on the water quality and environmental impacts after the construction of those projects are continuing wu et al 2004 therefore it is of crucial importance to take effective management to prevent and control the water quality degradation caused by these projects a long history of water quality studies for various water bodies and hydraulic projects have been conducted khan et al 2003 peyman et al 2017 shi et al 2016 of these the water quality assessment based on hydro chemical methods and field sampling data is indispensable for understanding the influence of anthropogenic activities and the heterogeneity of geological characteristics on water quality and for carrying out efficient water pollution control sany et al 2019 sun et al 2016 the water quality evaluation methods of previous studies were mainly based on specific domestic and or local standards some studies have determined parameters that can reflect and provide partial water quality information hoseinzadeh et al 2015 sun et al 2016 xia et al 2018 with the advantages of fully utilizing water quality parameter information and efficiently presenting the overall water quality status by the clear normative value the water quality index wqi has been extensively applied for the water quality assessment in a wide range of studies since the 1960s akkoyunlu and akiner 2012 benouara et al 2016 varnosfaderany et al 2009 the calculations of the wqi methods have been improved and developed in different ways for instance the national sanitation foundation wqi nsfwqi consisting of nine basic parameters e g the dissolved oxygen ph has been improved and applied in various regions of the world noori et al 2019 because of the advantages of flexible parameter selection and weights adjustment one developed wqi model known as the bascaron wqi has also widely found acceptance for water quality assessments of lakes and rivers in many developing countries pesce and wunderlin 2000 the applications of other refined wqis e g the oregon wqi the canadian wqi have also been reported in the past few decades gao et al 2016 ramos et al 2016 however since different wqis have different limitations in specific research more studies have focused on the efficient approaches for the wqis to the key parameters determination and the low analytical cost of measurement especially in developing countries simoes et al 2008 for instance the wqimin method which is based on selected key parameters and can reduce redundant information and or measurement costs for water quality parameters has been used as a widespread practical tool for evaluating the surface water quality kannel et al 2007 pesce and wunderlin 2000 simoes et al 2008 high correlations between the wqimin and wqi results have also been reported sanchez et al 2007 indicating that a suitable wqimin model can explain and evaluate the variations of the water quality economically and effectively however the calculation results of the wqimin models may perform differently due to the differences in the selected parameters and their weights naveedullah et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 additionally the parameters for the wqimin models and their performances need to be carefully considered and evaluated with the specific research background avigliano and schenone 2016 the middle route mr of the south to north water diversion project of china snwdpc is the longest inter basin water diversion project in the world providing more than 25 billion m³ of water resources to north china via 1276 km open canal and benefiting over 58 million inhabitants since 2014 in relation to its safe water quality and ecological impact issues it has attracted huge controversy and discussion since the beginning of its construction barnett et al 2015 chen and xie 2010 some studies have been conducted to explore and verify the water quality status of this project from its water source the danjiangkou reservoir to the reservoirs tributaries the heavy metals nutrients land use influence and planktonic algae community have been investigated chen et al 2018 li et al 2008 liu et al 2016 nevertheless further study is still necessary for the following reasons related studies were mostly carried out in its water source area and the upstream tributaries those investigations mainly conducted before the official operation of this project liu et al 2018 and the sampling sites were not located in the main canal thus it was difficult to fully and accurately illustrate the actual water quality status of the project some studies partly focused on specific categories of parameters such as the heavy metals basic physiochemical parameters or were based on a selected section of the main canal under specific conditions whereas comprehensive analyses and assessments of the overall water quality were rarely reported shao et al 2016 tang et al 2016 some results examining the project water quality had limitations due to short term data series nong et al 2019 additionally the key parameters which mainly affect the water quality variation of the project were seldom investigated to date there is still a lack of intensive understanding and analysis of the water quality after the project was officially put into operation considering the above factors and gaps we selected 16 water quality parameters measured monthly from the 27 fixed water quality monitoring stations of the project from march 2016 to february 2019 to conduct research on the project water quality the objectives of this study were 1 to analyse and demonstrate the spatio temporal variations of the water quality characteristics since the beginning of the project 2 to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the water quality using the water quality index method and 3 to understand the key water quality parameters and to promote efficient water quality management for the project in the future this study would be the first time to comprehensively report and demonstrate the water quality status and variations after the normal operation of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project of china thus providing a valuable and reliable platform to answer and or clarify some controversies raised by this mega hydro project and making contributions to management decisions of similar projects worldwide 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and background the middle route of the south to north water diversion project of china 32 67 39 98 n 111 71 116 27 e originates in the taocha danjiangkou reservoir and flows 1276 km northward while crossing four provinces to the tuancheng lake beijing the capital of china this project provides an important strategic infrastructure to alleviate the serious water resource shortages in north china and to optimize the allocation of domestic industrial and agricultural water among 19 cities of four provinces e g beijing and tianjin benefiting 58 59 million inhabitants in total since december 2014 the mr of the snwdpc spans the subtropical monsoon humid climate zone and the temperate monsoon climate zone with annual average precipitation between 542 7 and 1173 4 mm and annual average temperatures between 14 6 and 21 2 c over the period from 1986 to 2015 li et al 2015 to date the mr of the snwdpc has distributed more than 25 8 billion m³ of water resources to north china accounting for more than 70 of the total drinking water in the four provinces along the main canal to understand and monitor the project water quality changes in real time 27 water quality monitoring stations were built by the construction and administration bureau cab of the middle route of the south to north water division project of china along the main canal to collect and analyse monthly water samples more detailed information regarding the locations and abbreviated names of these water quality monitoring stations is shown in fig 1 and in the supplementary material table s1 2 2 sample measurement and data collection all the water quality data used in this study were obtained from the cab of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project of china with official permission water samples were collected monthly at 27 water quality monitoring stations from march 2016 to february 2019 by the professional research team of the cab based on the basic items of the environmental quality standards for surface water china 2002a and the standard of the guidance on sampling techniques china 2009 the methods for sample chemistry analyses were based on the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater china 2002b there are 16 water quality parameters in total including the ph water temperature wt c dissolved oxygen do mg l five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 mg l permanganate index pi mg l fecal coliform f coli colonies l total phosphorus tp mg l total nitrogen tn mg l ammonia nitrogen nh3 n mg l fluoride f mg l sulphate so4 2 mg l mercury hg μg l arsenic as μg l copper cu μg l zinc zn μg l and selenium se μg l the sampling dates for each month were uniformly selected and arranged by the cab and were based on the actual weather conditions at each station ensuring that the water samples were collected on sunny or cloudy to minimize the interference of rainfall strong winds and runoff with the data all the analytical instruments used at each station were purchased by the government from the same batches and sources which would minimize the interference from instrumental precision variations and sampling operations on the water quality data the samplings were conducted at the centre of the canal section with 1 4 depth below the water surface at each station in particular the samples for the do concentrations were conducted at the locations with the water flow showed low turbulent interference the ph wt and do were measured in situ using the multi parameter probes the samples for measuring the f coli were collected in brown sterile glass bottles without prewashed 1000 ml per sample three duplicate samples sealed with sterile packaging paper stored in cold and dark condition 0 4 c using portable refrigerators the samples for measuring the bod5 were collected in brown glass bottles 1000 ml per sample two samples at each site for comparison three replicates at each station stored in containers protecting from light at normal temperature other samples for the remaining parameters were collected in polyethylene bottles prewashed 2 3 times 1000 ml per sample three duplicate samples and stored in refrigerators 0 4 c protect from light all the water samples were immediately transferred to the laboratories located nearby the stations for further analysed within 24 h within 2 h for the f coli all the samples were labelled with detailed information using waterproof markers on the bottles to prevent misdiagnosis additionally blank samples were also used at all the stations to control the accuracy of analyses more details of the instrumental and chemical analysis methods used for the water samples are listed in the supplementary material table s2 and the ministry of ecology and environment of china http www mee gov cn ywgz fgbz bz 2 3 water quality index the calculations for the wqi in this study are based on equation 1 which was refined and developed by pesce and wunderlin 2000 as follows 1 w q i i 1 n c i p i i 1 n p i where n is the total number of water quality parameters in the study c i is the normalized value of the i th parameter and p i is the determined weight of the i th parameter the values of p i have been verified by previous studies and are listed in table s3 the calculation for the normalization values of c i in the wqi were adopted and revised based on the environmental quality standards for surface water china 2002a and hou et al 2016 as equation 2 2 c i 100 t i s i k s i k n s i k 20 n i i k t i s i k s i k n 100 t i s i k n 20 n t i 0 s i k where t i is the real measured concentration of the i th parameter s i k and s i k n are the standard thresholds of the i th parameter at level k and level k n respectively i i k is the standard normalization value of the parameter classification n is the number of the equal values of the threshold and if no equal threshold exists then n 1 in this study the wqimin model based on the key parameters selected by the stepwise multiple linear regression method was established the wqimin model considering the parameter weights were denoted as wqimin w and calculated according to equation 1 while the wqimin model without weights was denoted as wqimin nw and its calculation was based on equation 3 as follows 3 w q i m i n n w i 1 n c i n the water quality status in this study is classified into five grades based on the wqi values i e excellent 81 100 good 61 80 medium 41 60 poor 21 40 and very poor 0 20 which meets the actual water quality management standards in china the seasons in this study are defined as spring summer autumn and winter corresponding to the periods of march to may june to august september to november and december to february of the next year respectively therefore the wqi values for each monitoring station were calculated seasons from spring 2016 march to may 2016 to winter 2018 december 2018 to february 2019 twelve seasons in total 2 4 data processing the mann kendall m k test has been widely applied to analyse water quality trends in previous studies lee et al 2010 misaghi et al 2017 tabari et al 2011 the calculation processes of the m k test were shown in detail in guclu 2018 mann 1945 the results of the m k test have illustrated the trends of water quality parameters in this project and are shown in fig s1 the one way analysis of variance anova was applied to verify the spatial differences of parameters varol 2019 the wqimin models for the mr of the snwdpc in this study were established using the following steps 1 the wqi and the c i for each station in 2016 and 2017 were used as training data to select the key parameters for the wqimin model 2 the coefficient of determination r2 was used to evaluate the fitting degree of the established wqimin model and the root mean square error rmse and the percentage error pe were used to evaluate the forecasting precision of the wqimin models based on the testing data i e the wqi and the c i for each station in 2018 castrillo and garcía 2020 wu et al 2018 the data used in the stepwise multiple linear regression method were pre processing by the log transformation i e lg x 1 3 results 3 1 water quality characteristics table 1 and fig 2 display the statistical calculation summary of the annual mean concentrations and the station concentrations of 16 water quality parameters in the mr of the snwdpc respectively 3 1 1 biochemical and physicochemical parameters ph wt do bod5 pi and f coli the annual mean ph values were all greater than 8 12 while the maximum measured ph value occurred in both 2016 and 2018 and the minimum value was measured in 2016 indicating that the water in the mr of the snwdpc remained in an alkaline state during the monitoring period the average ph values at 12 consecutive stations from ss to zn were greater than 8 25 while the ph values were lower at the other 15 stations fig 2a the highest and lowest annual mean values for wt were 17 86 c and 17 23 c respectively the spatial variation of wt generally showed a decline from south to north and the lowest average wt value of stations was at the northernmost station i e the hn showing the water temperature was consistent with the air temperature variations in china fig 2b from the results of the m k test fig s1 four monitoring stations showed significant downward trends for ph which may indicate the influence of atmospheric precipitation inputs in these areas pu et al 2017 while all stations exhibited no significant wt trends the annual mean do concentrations for each year were higher than the class i standard 7 5 mg l the lowest detected do concentration was observed in 2016 7 0 mg l while all stations have detected do concentrations 7 5 mg l in 2017 and 2018 table 1 the mean do concentrations at the stations showed no spatial differences from south to north one way anova p 0 05 notably the northernmost three consecutive stations i e wh xs and hn all showed mean do concentrations 10 0 mg l while 63 17 27 of the stations have significant upward trends of the do these phenomena were inferred from the effects of water temperature and algal proliferation yang et al 2019 the annual mean concentrations of bod5 decreased from 2016 to 2018 while the highest detected bod5 was in 2016 there were 16 consecutive stations from tc to zn that showed mean bod5 concentrations greater than 1 2 mg l and exhibited significant downward trends while the other stations exhibited lower bod5 concentrations than that value fig 2d both bod5 and chemical oxygen demand cod can be used as parameters for characterizing the pollution levels of water by organic matter whereas each station during the monitoring period showed low cod concentrations and there was no specific value e g recorded as 10 mg l so the bod5 were used and studied in this article the annual mean pi concentrations were very close to the class i standard threshold while the maximum pi detected each year were all greater than 2 mg l indicating that the pi could cause the water quality to become class ii at some specific stations the mean pi concentrations of the stations displayed spatial variations that generally increased from south to north fig 2e whereas those stations that exhibited relatively high mean pi concentrations showed downward trends the annual mean and the maximum measured f coli contents both occurred in 2016 with values of 168 colonies l and 1917 colonies l summer 2016 respectively indicating that the f coli levels presented a high risk for causing the water quality to become class iii in 2016 the annual mean and maximum contents of the f coli showed downward trends from 2016 to 2018 table 1 there were 16 consecutive stations from tc to zn that showed mean f coli contents below 30 colonies l and these were significantly different from the remaining 11 consecutive stations from nc to hn which have the f coli contents ranging from 134 to 304 colonies l fig 2f indicating the influence of local pollution sources e g human and livestock release landfill leachate from nearby villages tong et al 2016 3 1 2 nutrients and soluble ions tp tn nh3 n so4 2 and f the annual mean tp concentration in 2016 was 0 019 mg l which was relatively higher than the concentrations in 2017 and 2018 the spatial distribution of the tp concentrations showed a decreasing trend with fluctuations from the southern to northern stations fig 2g there were 16 consecutive stations from tc to zn that showed tp concentrations greater than 0 013 mg l but also showed downward trends while the tp concentrations of the nc to hn stations were all below 0 012 mg l there was no obvious spatial change of tn from the southern to northern stations one way anova p 0 05 while the tn concentrations at 19 stations were greater than 1 0 mg l in total fig 2h the annual mean and maximum tn concentrations showed increasing trends year by year and 85 23 27 of the stations exhibited significant upward trends of the tn the annual mean nh3 n concentrations were far below the threshold of the class i standard while the maximum and minimum detected nh3 n concentrations were both observed in 2016 with values of 0 133 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively the mean nh3 n concentrations at the stations showed a narrow variation range from 0 032 to 0 049 mg l and no spatial differences fig 2i and only five stations showed significant trends for nh3 n the two soluble ions i e the so4 2 and f both showed narrow variations in their annual mean values ranging from 27 35 to 29 77 mg l for the so4 2 and 0 192 0 198 mg l for the f respectively the average so4 2 and f concentrations of stations showed no spatial variation one way anova p 0 05 whereas the three northern stations i e wh xs and hn showed relatively higher concentrations than the southern stations fig 2j and k which can be attributed to the precipitation inputs from atmospheric pollutants pu et al 2017 the highest and lowest detected concentrations of those two parameters showed no significant differences for each year while 70 19 27 of the stations showed significant downward trends for the so4 2 and only two stations showed significant trends for the f 3 1 3 heavy metal parameters zn cu as se and hg the annual mean concentrations of the five metal parameters did not differ significantly among the years the total mean concentrations of these parameters declined following the order of zn cu as se hg and remained stable at concentrations well below the respective thresholds of class i standard table 1 the mean concentrations of the zn hg and se of the stations showed fluctuations and exhibited no obvious spatial differences fig 2 u to w while the concentrations of the as at the nc to hn stations were relatively lower than those at the southern stations fig 2y the cu concentrations showed a spatial distribution opposite to that of the as fig 2x according to the m k test results there were 1 3 stations showed significant downward trends for the hg whereas the trends of the zn as and cu were random in addition the southern stations from tc to zn showed downward trends for the se while the rest of the northern stations displayed opposite trends these results can be attributed to the differences in mineral composition of the rocks and the soil nearby the main canal and the synergistic effects of the natural processes and the project self purification capabilities gao et al 2016 wei et al 2009 3 2 water quality assessment using the wqi method the wqi results show the spatial profiles and seasonal patterns of the water quality variations in the mr of the snwdpc fig 3 overall the water quality of the project was classified at excellent level from 2016 to 2018 with all the stations showing average wqi values 85 for the temporal patterns of the wqi variations the highest and lowest seasonal average wqis during the monitoring period were in the spring of 2017 and the summer of 2016 with values of 91 82 and 87 67 respectively fig 3a the variations of the wqi in 2016 were different from those in 2017 and 2018 with the lowest wqi values in summer followed by spring 89 20 autumn 89 54 and winter 90 18 the seasonal values of the wqi in 2017 and 2018 presented consistent seasonal variations the wqi values decreased from spring to summer and the lowest and highest wqi values occurred in the summer and the spring of each year respectively the wqis then increased from summer to autumn and fell again in winter these results can be attributed to the regular operations of the project that gradually created a stable water environment in general the water quality at the stations from south to north remained relatively stable and did not exhibit distinct spatial variations the mean wqi values at the stations ranged from 90 17 to 90 71 whereas the 16 consecutive stations from tc to zn showed significant seasonal variations in wqi compared to the rest of the northern fig 3b this tendency appeared to indicate the self purification ability of the water bodies under the long distance and high flow conditions in the mr of the snwdpc 3 3 selection of modified water quality parameters the stepwise multiple linear regression results table s4 showed that tp provided the highest contribution to the wqi based on the training data with r2 0 603 p 0 001 while the f coli hg and wt parameters entered the model in sequence and markedly increased the r2 values of the regression models with values of 0 784 0 846 and 0 914 respectively additionally bod5 and do were selected as the fifth and sixth parameters and marginally improved the performance of the models therefore tp f coli hg and wt were selected as the basic parameters in the wqimin model to assess the water quality of the mr of the snwdpc and the effects of the introduction of bod5 and do into the wqimin model have also been considered and evaluated the performance of the wqimin model was based on a comprehensive evaluation of the r2 rmse and pe values table 2 the results showed that the increase of the parameters according to the regression selection can indeed improve the r2 values regardless of whether the weights are considered in the wqimin calculation while the rmse and pe values in the wqimin w models that considered the weights were generally lower than those of the wqimin nw models without weights indicating that the wqimin models that considered the parameter weights can perform better when explaining the wqi values than those models that did not use parameter weights additionally differences were observed between the wqi and wqimin values based on the training dataset while the wqimin w3 model showed the best performance with the closest correlations with the wqi fig 4 furthermore the wqimin w3 model presented the lowest rmse and pe values among the wqimin models based on the training dataset indicating that it was the most suitable wqimin model for the wqis in this study the results from the wqimin predictions based on the testing data showed that the wqimin w3 model also presented the best performance among the wqimin models and had the lowest rmse and pe values of 2 21 and 1 93 r2 0 901 p 0 05 respectively fig 5 comparing the r2 0 852 rmse 2 86 and pe 2 50 values it was found that the wqimin w2 model which also had five selected parameters performed relatively poorly compared to the w3 model the wqimin w4 model showed a slightly larger r2 value than the w3 model whereas its rmse and pe values were also greater indicating that the prediction ability of this model was poorer than that of the w3 model additionally the calculations based on the testing dataset also demonstrated that the wqimin models that considered the weights all performed better than those that did not consider the weights when using the same parameters which is also consistent with the results from the training dataset 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of water quality and its impact sources the water quality in the mr of the snwdpc can be classified as excellent level during the monitoring period from both seasonal and spatial patterns of evaluation the danjiangkou reservoir which serves as the water source for this project exhibited similar physicochemical parameters of water quality in 2014 when compared to this study table 3 indicating that the water quality of this reservoir has improved significantly in the past ten years due to pollution controls and management by the chinese government chen et al 2015 xin et al 2015 when comparing our results with the water quality of the danjiang and hanjiang rivers and other upper tributaries of the danjiangkou reservoir the concentrations of the tp nh3 n and fecal coliform in those rivers were relatively high which could present potential pollution risks for the water quality of the mr of the snwdpc liu et al 2018 the low bod5 and pi concentrations indicated a low organic pollution risk for the water quality of this project while both the annual average and station values showed a significant increasing trend for the tn these results showed a strong relationship with the water quality changes of the danjiangkou reservoir shen et al 2015 yin et al 2018 stated that the total water supply gradually increased after the project started resulting in increasing water levels in the danjiangkou reservoir and changes in the land use structure of its basin while the submerged farmland and mountain areas may cause the release of nitrogen phosphorus and other nutrients from the soil into the water some studies have found that the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus n p plays an important role in reflecting the nutrient structure of phytoplankton in water bodies chen et al 2018 gikas et al 2009 huang et al 2017 taylor and cunliffe 2016 the annual mean n p mass ratios from 2016 to 2018 in our study were 44 5 98 6 and 99 3 respectively while the ratios of the stations ranged from 85 48 to 94 39 some scholars have used the c n p ratio 106 16 1 atom ratio 41 7 1 mass ratio to evaluate the nutrient limitation state redfield et al 1963 however the optimum ratio of n p varies widely ranging from 4 to 133 in different water bodies gikas et al 2006 klausmeier et al 2004 although it was still difficult to determine that the phosphorus was the most critical limiting nutrient in the mr of the snwdpc the proliferation of algae in this project possibly caused by nutrient elements needs special attention in future monitoring work filstrup and downing 2017 anthropogenic activities such as sewage discharge land management and vehicle exhaust emissions play important roles in heavy metal concentration changes cheung et al 2003 li et al 2008 however as this project passes through villages and towns with low population densities and because strict real time monitoring and protection were always conducted along the canal the heavy metal parameters in the water remained relatively stable during the monitoring period compared with the three gorges reservoir table 3 indicating that the overall effect of human activities on heavy metals of this project was relatively low the average concentrations of cu se and as were less than 20 of the corresponding parameters measured at the danjiangkou reservoir in 2004 li et al 2008 while song et al found that the submerged land of the danjiangkou reservoir has not resulted in large scale heavy metal pollution in water bodies which was consistent with our results however some stations detected hg and as contents that were abnormally higher than the annual average concentrations liang et al 2017 reported the potential risk of several dumps and farms in the protected area on both sides of the main canal although no sewage was directly discharged into the water in this project the leachate generated by the dumps and farms could enter the canal through groundwater or runoff therefore further detailed investigation and strict control management of the risk sources around the main canal should be conducted 4 2 the selected key parameters of the wqimin models for the mr of the snwdpc according to the stepwise multiple linear regression analysis results the proposed wqimin model in this study for the mr of the snwdpc consists of five key water quality parameters i e tp f coli hg wt and do which showed very good performance for water quality evaluations the selected parameters of the wqimin model should be able to explain the overall variations and characteristics of water quality comprehensively and should be conducive for efficiently evaluating water quality with relative lower measurement costs pesce and wunderlin 2000 as the first parameter selected by the regression model tp provided the greatest contribution for explaining the wqi variations r2 0 60 p 0 001 which was consistent with the high nitrogen phosphorus ratios in the water body as discussed above in addition tn was not used as a parameter to calculate wqis in this study and the average nh3 n concentrations remained stable and were less than 40 of the tn content which was not a major contributor to the wqi variations therefore tp represented the nutritional parameters of water quality and reflected the uniqueness of this project relative to some other studies of lakes wu et al 2018 xu et al 2009 however other previous studies have reported the important impacts of the tp effect on the water quality of rivers and reservoirs hou et al 2016 kocer and sevgili 2014 the f coli shows the second highest explanatory value for the wqi variations which represent the physiochemical parameters of the water quality some studies have found that the f coli concentrations show obvious seasonal variation characteristics and that their peak values generally occur in summer and may be related to human health risks such as gastroenteritis gao et al 2016 the f coli concentrations in the hanjiang and danjiang rivers were relatively high and the water from these rivers flowed into the danjiangkou reservoir table 3 therefore this parameter could play a key role in affecting water quality changes and is used to indicate the impacts of anthropogenic activities and urban pollution risk sources chaudhary et al 2017 noble et al 2003 the hg was introduced into the regression model as the third parameter and is representative of the heavy metals affecting water quality that may provide potential risks to human health there are eight heavy metal parameters i e zn cu hg as se cd cr and pb contained in the basic items of the environmental quality standards for surface water of china china 2002a while our study involved five of them i e zn cu hg as and se in the wqi calculations because the cd cr and pb concentrations were quite low and have remained in a not detected status since december 2016 wu et al 2009 reported on the ubiquitous heavy metal problems throughout the yangtze river basin while gao et al found that the heavy metal concentrations in the three gorges reservoir located in the middle stream of the yangtze river were quite low and were acceptable for human consumption which was similar to the heavy metal concentration results obtained in our study our results indicated the notable achievements that the chinese government has made in water quality management and pollution control for large scale water conservancy and supply projects such as the three gorges reservoir dam and the mr of the snwdpc however many studies have indicated that hg and as pollutions have become global environmental issues due to their characteristics of easy transformation and bioaccumulation in the food chain giri and singh 2014 wiener et al 2006 therefore the changes in hg concentrations in this project still need close attention water temperature and dissolved oxygen were the fourth and fifth parameters selected into the wqimin model in this study respectively although the wt was assigned the lowest weight among all the parameters it became the fourth parameter to enter the regression model and reflected a good explanation of the wqi values the bod5 and do are important water quality parameters of special concern in previous studies jindal and sharma 2011 kannel et al 2007 despite the priority of bod5 being selected into the regression model before do based on the training data the calculation results showed that the wqimin model that included do performed better than those that included bod5 the main reason for this result can be attributed to the strict water quality management by the chinese government that causes the water body of this project to be free from organic pollution our calculation results from both the training and testing datasets also consistent with this phenomenon which is different from some research results on rivers or lakes that may be polluted by external sources such as sewage discharge singh et al 2005 when bod5 entered the wqimin model the rmse and pe values of the model increased by different degrees which indicated that bod5 cannot perform better than do as a key parameter for the wqimin model established in this study do is a parameter that can typically reflect water quality status and do can affect the growth of aquatic organisms and many complex biochemical processes many researchers have also used do as a key parameter in wqimin models for different water bodies kannel et al 2007 pesce and wunderlin 2000 sanchez et al 2007 4 3 the effects of the weights on the wqimin models the methods for setting weights and normalization factors may be important factors that differ from other research cases in the key water quality parameters selected of this study in early research the weights used in the wqi calculations were generally not considered in the wqimin models pesce and wunderlin 2000 simoes et al 2008 in later studies some scholars improved the water quality evaluation method based on the wqi while most of their studies considered the weights of the parameters in the wqimin models thus causing the results to be closer to the actual situations avigliano and schenone 2016 naveedullah et al 2016 our study comprehensively compared the performances of two wqimin models with and without weights based on the evaluation of the r2 rmse and pe values of the models using the same key parameters the results showed that the wqimin model that considered the weights could better explain the variations in wqis and had higher prediction accuracy for water quality assessment than the models without weights therefore we recommend the use of the wqimin model with weights to evaluate water quality additionally the determination of weights is affected by the personal experience and knowledge background of researchers which may to a certain extent have subjective effects noori et al 2019 therefore we suggest that in actual research the weights should be determined and adjusted on the basis of extensive literature reviews and according to the measured data and the background of the object to build a more realistic wqimin model 4 4 novelty challenges and future work the construction and operation of mega hydro projects are always drawn on extensive controversy and discussion as it had to faced and handled a wide range of challenges such as ecology and environmental protection national security and economic development zhao et al 2017 some comments pointed out that the negative effects of the pollution and environmental can make the snwdpc unsustainable and might well mark the nadir of mega hydro engineering solutions to china s water issues barnett et al 2015 from the perspective of water quality our research can explain and respond to some criticisms of this project proving a reliable evidence that the water quality of this project is excellent and stable which is different from some conclusions of previous studies that only rely on the investigation of its water source area the danjiangkou reservoir liu et al 2018 song et al 2017 additionally under the conditions of normal operation and stable water environment the wqimin model proposed in this study can evaluate the water quality status using the key parameters which has valuable application from the perspective of saving the measurement cost of parameters and improving the efficiency of evaluation certainly as with all the scientific research this study has obvious limitations first the data were observed in normal operating conditions rather than in a manipulative experiment thus some key environmental factors affecting the water quality variations may be ignored second due to the difference of domestic and international standards some special parameters e g the priority substances have not been tested and analysed in our monitoring which to some extent limited our understanding of their impact on human health and water quality hao et al 2018 considering that this project will continue to operate for many years different types of data such as priority substances and algal proliferation and or controlled in situ experiments may be required in this project in the future 5 conclusions the water quality status of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project of china from march 2016 to february 2019 and the spatio temporal variations of 16 parameters were studied and analysed in this article the wqi method was used to comprehensively evaluate the water quality from the seasonal and spatial patterns and the key water quality parameters were selected the main conclusions are as follows 1 the heavy metal parameters in the mr of the snwdpc have remained at stable low concentrations and satisfy the guidelines of the class i standard of china while all the physicochemical and nutrient parameters except the tn conformed to the class i or ii standards during the monitoring period showing the water quality of the project is better than that of most natural water bodies and can ensure the reliable and safe water supply demand to north china however the proliferation of algae in this project possibly caused by nutrient elements needs special attention 2 the water quality of the project maintained an excellent level with the mean wqi values of stations and seasons ranging from 90 17 to 90 71 and 87 67 to 91 82 respectively while summer is the season exhibiting the worst water quality with the lowest wqi values in each year 3 the proposed wqimin model in this study consisted of five key parameters i e the tp fecal coliform hg water temperature and dissolved oxygen and showed excellent performance for explaining and evaluating the water quality of this project especially when the parameter weights were considered in the wqi calculations indicating a valuable application for the saving of the parameter measurement cost and the improvement of the evaluation efficiency this study presented informative data useful models and methods for water quality management of the mr of the snwdpc and provided a reference for similar projects to determine key water quality parameters and to more efficiently evaluate water quality considering that this project will continue to supply water for many years and has a service population of more than 58 million people and far reaching impacts more research

17910,the world s longest trans basin water diversion project the middle route mr of the south to north water diversion project of china snwdpc has officially been in operation for over 5 years since december 2014 its water quality status has always attracted special attention because it is related to the health and safety of more than 58 million people and the integrity of an ecosystem covering more than 155 000 km2 this study presented and analysed the spatio temporal variations and trends of 16 water quality parameters including ph water temperature wt dissolved oxygen do permanganate index pi five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 fecal coliform f coli total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh3 n sulphate so4 2 fluoride f mercury hg arsenic as selenium se copper cu and zinc zn which were determined monthly from samples collected at 27 water quality monitoring stations in the mr of the snwdpc from march 2016 to february 2019 the water quality index wqi was used to evaluate the seasonal and spatial water quality changes during the monitoring period and a new wqimin model consisting of five crucial parameters i e tp f coli hg wt and do was built by using stepwise multiple linear regression analysis the results demonstrated that the water quality status of the mr of the snwdpc has been steadily maintained at an excellent level during the monitoring period with an overall average wqi value of 90 39 and twelve seasonal mean wqi values ranging from 87 67 to 91 82 the proposed wqimin model that uses the selected five key parameters and the weights of those parameters has exhibited excellent performance in the water quality assessment of the project with the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and percentage error pe values of 0 901 2 21 1 93 respectively showing that the proposed wqimin model is a useful and efficient tool to evaluate and manage the water quality for the management department the risk sources near certain stations with abnormally high values should be carefully inspected and strictly managed to maintain excellent water quality the potential risks of algae proliferation in this project should be of concern in future research graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality index water quality assessment parameters selection the south to north water diversion project of china stepwise multiple linear regression 1 introduction adequate and high quality water is one of the most important foundations for the healthy and sustainable development of human society and ecosystems vorosmarty et al 2010 with the considerable growth of the world population and the rapid development of urbanization in developing countries many hydraulic engineering projects have been built to meet the water consumption demands for domestic drinking industrial production and agricultural irrigation niu et al 2019 while connecting and allocating rivers lakes sea and other water resources for human use hydraulic projects also make the water quality issues faced by human beings more intricate than ever before bayram et al 2014 these projects such as dams reservoirs and water supply canals have changed water basin environments and have impacted land use plant structures and population densities factors that can cause the water quality to be complicated putro et al 2016 todd et al 2012 in particular the deterioration of water quality has become global issues and occurred in various hydraulic projects over the past decades crossetti et al 2008 and the controversies and studies on the water quality and environmental impacts after the construction of those projects are continuing wu et al 2004 therefore it is of crucial importance to take effective management to prevent and control the water quality degradation caused by these projects a long history of water quality studies for various water bodies and hydraulic projects have been conducted khan et al 2003 peyman et al 2017 shi et al 2016 of these the water quality assessment based on hydro chemical methods and field sampling data is indispensable for understanding the influence of anthropogenic activities and the heterogeneity of geological characteristics on water quality and for carrying out efficient water pollution control sany et al 2019 sun et al 2016 the water quality evaluation methods of previous studies were mainly based on specific domestic and or local standards some studies have determined parameters that can reflect and provide partial water quality information hoseinzadeh et al 2015 sun et al 2016 xia et al 2018 with the advantages of fully utilizing water quality parameter information and efficiently presenting the overall water quality status by the clear normative value the water quality index wqi has been extensively applied for the water quality assessment in a wide range of studies since the 1960s akkoyunlu and akiner 2012 benouara et al 2016 varnosfaderany et al 2009 the calculations of the wqi methods have been improved and developed in different ways for instance the national sanitation foundation wqi nsfwqi consisting of nine basic parameters e g the dissolved oxygen ph has been improved and applied in various regions of the world noori et al 2019 because of the advantages of flexible parameter selection and weights adjustment one developed wqi model known as the bascaron wqi has also widely found acceptance for water quality assessments of lakes and rivers in many developing countries pesce and wunderlin 2000 the applications of other refined wqis e g the oregon wqi the canadian wqi have also been reported in the past few decades gao et al 2016 ramos et al 2016 however since different wqis have different limitations in specific research more studies have focused on the efficient approaches for the wqis to the key parameters determination and the low analytical cost of measurement especially in developing countries simoes et al 2008 for instance the wqimin method which is based on selected key parameters and can reduce redundant information and or measurement costs for water quality parameters has been used as a widespread practical tool for evaluating the surface water quality kannel et al 2007 pesce and wunderlin 2000 simoes et al 2008 high correlations between the wqimin and wqi results have also been reported sanchez et al 2007 indicating that a suitable wqimin model can explain and evaluate the variations of the water quality economically and effectively however the calculation results of the wqimin models may perform differently due to the differences in the selected parameters and their weights naveedullah et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 additionally the parameters for the wqimin models and their performances need to be carefully considered and evaluated with the specific research background avigliano and schenone 2016 the middle route mr of the south to north water diversion project of china snwdpc is the longest inter basin water diversion project in the world providing more than 25 billion m³ of water resources to north china via 1276 km open canal and benefiting over 58 million inhabitants since 2014 in relation to its safe water quality and ecological impact issues it has attracted huge controversy and discussion since the beginning of its construction barnett et al 2015 chen and xie 2010 some studies have been conducted to explore and verify the water quality status of this project from its water source the danjiangkou reservoir to the reservoirs tributaries the heavy metals nutrients land use influence and planktonic algae community have been investigated chen et al 2018 li et al 2008 liu et al 2016 nevertheless further study is still necessary for the following reasons related studies were mostly carried out in its water source area and the upstream tributaries those investigations mainly conducted before the official operation of this project liu et al 2018 and the sampling sites were not located in the main canal thus it was difficult to fully and accurately illustrate the actual water quality status of the project some studies partly focused on specific categories of parameters such as the heavy metals basic physiochemical parameters or were based on a selected section of the main canal under specific conditions whereas comprehensive analyses and assessments of the overall water quality were rarely reported shao et al 2016 tang et al 2016 some results examining the project water quality had limitations due to short term data series nong et al 2019 additionally the key parameters which mainly affect the water quality variation of the project were seldom investigated to date there is still a lack of intensive understanding and analysis of the water quality after the project was officially put into operation considering the above factors and gaps we selected 16 water quality parameters measured monthly from the 27 fixed water quality monitoring stations of the project from march 2016 to february 2019 to conduct research on the project water quality the objectives of this study were 1 to analyse and demonstrate the spatio temporal variations of the water quality characteristics since the beginning of the project 2 to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the water quality using the water quality index method and 3 to understand the key water quality parameters and to promote efficient water quality management for the project in the future this study would be the first time to comprehensively report and demonstrate the water quality status and variations after the normal operation of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project of china thus providing a valuable and reliable platform to answer and or clarify some controversies raised by this mega hydro project and making contributions to management decisions of similar projects worldwide 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and background the middle route of the south to north water diversion project of china 32 67 39 98 n 111 71 116 27 e originates in the taocha danjiangkou reservoir and flows 1276 km northward while crossing four provinces to the tuancheng lake beijing the capital of china this project provides an important strategic infrastructure to alleviate the serious water resource shortages in north china and to optimize the allocation of domestic industrial and agricultural water among 19 cities of four provinces e g beijing and tianjin benefiting 58 59 million inhabitants in total since december 2014 the mr of the snwdpc spans the subtropical monsoon humid climate zone and the temperate monsoon climate zone with annual average precipitation between 542 7 and 1173 4 mm and annual average temperatures between 14 6 and 21 2 c over the period from 1986 to 2015 li et al 2015 to date the mr of the snwdpc has distributed more than 25 8 billion m³ of water resources to north china accounting for more than 70 of the total drinking water in the four provinces along the main canal to understand and monitor the project water quality changes in real time 27 water quality monitoring stations were built by the construction and administration bureau cab of the middle route of the south to north water division project of china along the main canal to collect and analyse monthly water samples more detailed information regarding the locations and abbreviated names of these water quality monitoring stations is shown in fig 1 and in the supplementary material table s1 2 2 sample measurement and data collection all the water quality data used in this study were obtained from the cab of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project of china with official permission water samples were collected monthly at 27 water quality monitoring stations from march 2016 to february 2019 by the professional research team of the cab based on the basic items of the environmental quality standards for surface water china 2002a and the standard of the guidance on sampling techniques china 2009 the methods for sample chemistry analyses were based on the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater china 2002b there are 16 water quality parameters in total including the ph water temperature wt c dissolved oxygen do mg l five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 mg l permanganate index pi mg l fecal coliform f coli colonies l total phosphorus tp mg l total nitrogen tn mg l ammonia nitrogen nh3 n mg l fluoride f mg l sulphate so4 2 mg l mercury hg μg l arsenic as μg l copper cu μg l zinc zn μg l and selenium se μg l the sampling dates for each month were uniformly selected and arranged by the cab and were based on the actual weather conditions at each station ensuring that the water samples were collected on sunny or cloudy to minimize the interference of rainfall strong winds and runoff with the data all the analytical instruments used at each station were purchased by the government from the same batches and sources which would minimize the interference from instrumental precision variations and sampling operations on the water quality data the samplings were conducted at the centre of the canal section with 1 4 depth below the water surface at each station in particular the samples for the do concentrations were conducted at the locations with the water flow showed low turbulent interference the ph wt and do were measured in situ using the multi parameter probes the samples for measuring the f coli were collected in brown sterile glass bottles without prewashed 1000 ml per sample three duplicate samples sealed with sterile packaging paper stored in cold and dark condition 0 4 c using portable refrigerators the samples for measuring the bod5 were collected in brown glass bottles 1000 ml per sample two samples at each site for comparison three replicates at each station stored in containers protecting from light at normal temperature other samples for the remaining parameters were collected in polyethylene bottles prewashed 2 3 times 1000 ml per sample three duplicate samples and stored in refrigerators 0 4 c protect from light all the water samples were immediately transferred to the laboratories located nearby the stations for further analysed within 24 h within 2 h for the f coli all the samples were labelled with detailed information using waterproof markers on the bottles to prevent misdiagnosis additionally blank samples were also used at all the stations to control the accuracy of analyses more details of the instrumental and chemical analysis methods used for the water samples are listed in the supplementary material table s2 and the ministry of ecology and environment of china http www mee gov cn ywgz fgbz bz 2 3 water quality index the calculations for the wqi in this study are based on equation 1 which was refined and developed by pesce and wunderlin 2000 as follows 1 w q i i 1 n c i p i i 1 n p i where n is the total number of water quality parameters in the study c i is the normalized value of the i th parameter and p i is the determined weight of the i th parameter the values of p i have been verified by previous studies and are listed in table s3 the calculation for the normalization values of c i in the wqi were adopted and revised based on the environmental quality standards for surface water china 2002a and hou et al 2016 as equation 2 2 c i 100 t i s i k s i k n s i k 20 n i i k t i s i k s i k n 100 t i s i k n 20 n t i 0 s i k where t i is the real measured concentration of the i th parameter s i k and s i k n are the standard thresholds of the i th parameter at level k and level k n respectively i i k is the standard normalization value of the parameter classification n is the number of the equal values of the threshold and if no equal threshold exists then n 1 in this study the wqimin model based on the key parameters selected by the stepwise multiple linear regression method was established the wqimin model considering the parameter weights were denoted as wqimin w and calculated according to equation 1 while the wqimin model without weights was denoted as wqimin nw and its calculation was based on equation 3 as follows 3 w q i m i n n w i 1 n c i n the water quality status in this study is classified into five grades based on the wqi values i e excellent 81 100 good 61 80 medium 41 60 poor 21 40 and very poor 0 20 which meets the actual water quality management standards in china the seasons in this study are defined as spring summer autumn and winter corresponding to the periods of march to may june to august september to november and december to february of the next year respectively therefore the wqi values for each monitoring station were calculated seasons from spring 2016 march to may 2016 to winter 2018 december 2018 to february 2019 twelve seasons in total 2 4 data processing the mann kendall m k test has been widely applied to analyse water quality trends in previous studies lee et al 2010 misaghi et al 2017 tabari et al 2011 the calculation processes of the m k test were shown in detail in guclu 2018 mann 1945 the results of the m k test have illustrated the trends of water quality parameters in this project and are shown in fig s1 the one way analysis of variance anova was applied to verify the spatial differences of parameters varol 2019 the wqimin models for the mr of the snwdpc in this study were established using the following steps 1 the wqi and the c i for each station in 2016 and 2017 were used as training data to select the key parameters for the wqimin model 2 the coefficient of determination r2 was used to evaluate the fitting degree of the established wqimin model and the root mean square error rmse and the percentage error pe were used to evaluate the forecasting precision of the wqimin models based on the testing data i e the wqi and the c i for each station in 2018 castrillo and garcía 2020 wu et al 2018 the data used in the stepwise multiple linear regression method were pre processing by the log transformation i e lg x 1 3 results 3 1 water quality characteristics table 1 and fig 2 display the statistical calculation summary of the annual mean concentrations and the station concentrations of 16 water quality parameters in the mr of the snwdpc respectively 3 1 1 biochemical and physicochemical parameters ph wt do bod5 pi and f coli the annual mean ph values were all greater than 8 12 while the maximum measured ph value occurred in both 2016 and 2018 and the minimum value was measured in 2016 indicating that the water in the mr of the snwdpc remained in an alkaline state during the monitoring period the average ph values at 12 consecutive stations from ss to zn were greater than 8 25 while the ph values were lower at the other 15 stations fig 2a the highest and lowest annual mean values for wt were 17 86 c and 17 23 c respectively the spatial variation of wt generally showed a decline from south to north and the lowest average wt value of stations was at the northernmost station i e the hn showing the water temperature was consistent with the air temperature variations in china fig 2b from the results of the m k test fig s1 four monitoring stations showed significant downward trends for ph which may indicate the influence of atmospheric precipitation inputs in these areas pu et al 2017 while all stations exhibited no significant wt trends the annual mean do concentrations for each year were higher than the class i standard 7 5 mg l the lowest detected do concentration was observed in 2016 7 0 mg l while all stations have detected do concentrations 7 5 mg l in 2017 and 2018 table 1 the mean do concentrations at the stations showed no spatial differences from south to north one way anova p 0 05 notably the northernmost three consecutive stations i e wh xs and hn all showed mean do concentrations 10 0 mg l while 63 17 27 of the stations have significant upward trends of the do these phenomena were inferred from the effects of water temperature and algal proliferation yang et al 2019 the annual mean concentrations of bod5 decreased from 2016 to 2018 while the highest detected bod5 was in 2016 there were 16 consecutive stations from tc to zn that showed mean bod5 concentrations greater than 1 2 mg l and exhibited significant downward trends while the other stations exhibited lower bod5 concentrations than that value fig 2d both bod5 and chemical oxygen demand cod can be used as parameters for characterizing the pollution levels of water by organic matter whereas each station during the monitoring period showed low cod concentrations and there was no specific value e g recorded as 10 mg l so the bod5 were used and studied in this article the annual mean pi concentrations were very close to the class i standard threshold while the maximum pi detected each year were all greater than 2 mg l indicating that the pi could cause the water quality to become class ii at some specific stations the mean pi concentrations of the stations displayed spatial variations that generally increased from south to north fig 2e whereas those stations that exhibited relatively high mean pi concentrations showed downward trends the annual mean and the maximum measured f coli contents both occurred in 2016 with values of 168 colonies l and 1917 colonies l summer 2016 respectively indicating that the f coli levels presented a high risk for causing the water quality to become class iii in 2016 the annual mean and maximum contents of the f coli showed downward trends from 2016 to 2018 table 1 there were 16 consecutive stations from tc to zn that showed mean f coli contents below 30 colonies l and these were significantly different from the remaining 11 consecutive stations from nc to hn which have the f coli contents ranging from 134 to 304 colonies l fig 2f indicating the influence of local pollution sources e g human and livestock release landfill leachate from nearby villages tong et al 2016 3 1 2 nutrients and soluble ions tp tn nh3 n so4 2 and f the annual mean tp concentration in 2016 was 0 019 mg l which was relatively higher than the concentrations in 2017 and 2018 the spatial distribution of the tp concentrations showed a decreasing trend with fluctuations from the southern to northern stations fig 2g there were 16 consecutive stations from tc to zn that showed tp concentrations greater than 0 013 mg l but also showed downward trends while the tp concentrations of the nc to hn stations were all below 0 012 mg l there was no obvious spatial change of tn from the southern to northern stations one way anova p 0 05 while the tn concentrations at 19 stations were greater than 1 0 mg l in total fig 2h the annual mean and maximum tn concentrations showed increasing trends year by year and 85 23 27 of the stations exhibited significant upward trends of the tn the annual mean nh3 n concentrations were far below the threshold of the class i standard while the maximum and minimum detected nh3 n concentrations were both observed in 2016 with values of 0 133 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively the mean nh3 n concentrations at the stations showed a narrow variation range from 0 032 to 0 049 mg l and no spatial differences fig 2i and only five stations showed significant trends for nh3 n the two soluble ions i e the so4 2 and f both showed narrow variations in their annual mean values ranging from 27 35 to 29 77 mg l for the so4 2 and 0 192 0 198 mg l for the f respectively the average so4 2 and f concentrations of stations showed no spatial variation one way anova p 0 05 whereas the three northern stations i e wh xs and hn showed relatively higher concentrations than the southern stations fig 2j and k which can be attributed to the precipitation inputs from atmospheric pollutants pu et al 2017 the highest and lowest detected concentrations of those two parameters showed no significant differences for each year while 70 19 27 of the stations showed significant downward trends for the so4 2 and only two stations showed significant trends for the f 3 1 3 heavy metal parameters zn cu as se and hg the annual mean concentrations of the five metal parameters did not differ significantly among the years the total mean concentrations of these parameters declined following the order of zn cu as se hg and remained stable at concentrations well below the respective thresholds of class i standard table 1 the mean concentrations of the zn hg and se of the stations showed fluctuations and exhibited no obvious spatial differences fig 2 u to w while the concentrations of the as at the nc to hn stations were relatively lower than those at the southern stations fig 2y the cu concentrations showed a spatial distribution opposite to that of the as fig 2x according to the m k test results there were 1 3 stations showed significant downward trends for the hg whereas the trends of the zn as and cu were random in addition the southern stations from tc to zn showed downward trends for the se while the rest of the northern stations displayed opposite trends these results can be attributed to the differences in mineral composition of the rocks and the soil nearby the main canal and the synergistic effects of the natural processes and the project self purification capabilities gao et al 2016 wei et al 2009 3 2 water quality assessment using the wqi method the wqi results show the spatial profiles and seasonal patterns of the water quality variations in the mr of the snwdpc fig 3 overall the water quality of the project was classified at excellent level from 2016 to 2018 with all the stations showing average wqi values 85 for the temporal patterns of the wqi variations the highest and lowest seasonal average wqis during the monitoring period were in the spring of 2017 and the summer of 2016 with values of 91 82 and 87 67 respectively fig 3a the variations of the wqi in 2016 were different from those in 2017 and 2018 with the lowest wqi values in summer followed by spring 89 20 autumn 89 54 and winter 90 18 the seasonal values of the wqi in 2017 and 2018 presented consistent seasonal variations the wqi values decreased from spring to summer and the lowest and highest wqi values occurred in the summer and the spring of each year respectively the wqis then increased from summer to autumn and fell again in winter these results can be attributed to the regular operations of the project that gradually created a stable water environment in general the water quality at the stations from south to north remained relatively stable and did not exhibit distinct spatial variations the mean wqi values at the stations ranged from 90 17 to 90 71 whereas the 16 consecutive stations from tc to zn showed significant seasonal variations in wqi compared to the rest of the northern fig 3b this tendency appeared to indicate the self purification ability of the water bodies under the long distance and high flow conditions in the mr of the snwdpc 3 3 selection of modified water quality parameters the stepwise multiple linear regression results table s4 showed that tp provided the highest contribution to the wqi based on the training data with r2 0 603 p 0 001 while the f coli hg and wt parameters entered the model in sequence and markedly increased the r2 values of the regression models with values of 0 784 0 846 and 0 914 respectively additionally bod5 and do were selected as the fifth and sixth parameters and marginally improved the performance of the models therefore tp f coli hg and wt were selected as the basic parameters in the wqimin model to assess the water quality of the mr of the snwdpc and the effects of the introduction of bod5 and do into the wqimin model have also been considered and evaluated the performance of the wqimin model was based on a comprehensive evaluation of the r2 rmse and pe values table 2 the results showed that the increase of the parameters according to the regression selection can indeed improve the r2 values regardless of whether the weights are considered in the wqimin calculation while the rmse and pe values in the wqimin w models that considered the weights were generally lower than those of the wqimin nw models without weights indicating that the wqimin models that considered the parameter weights can perform better when explaining the wqi values than those models that did not use parameter weights additionally differences were observed between the wqi and wqimin values based on the training dataset while the wqimin w3 model showed the best performance with the closest correlations with the wqi fig 4 furthermore the wqimin w3 model presented the lowest rmse and pe values among the wqimin models based on the training dataset indicating that it was the most suitable wqimin model for the wqis in this study the results from the wqimin predictions based on the testing data showed that the wqimin w3 model also presented the best performance among the wqimin models and had the lowest rmse and pe values of 2 21 and 1 93 r2 0 901 p 0 05 respectively fig 5 comparing the r2 0 852 rmse 2 86 and pe 2 50 values it was found that the wqimin w2 model which also had five selected parameters performed relatively poorly compared to the w3 model the wqimin w4 model showed a slightly larger r2 value than the w3 model whereas its rmse and pe values were also greater indicating that the prediction ability of this model was poorer than that of the w3 model additionally the calculations based on the testing dataset also demonstrated that the wqimin models that considered the weights all performed better than those that did not consider the weights when using the same parameters which is also consistent with the results from the training dataset 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of water quality and its impact sources the water quality in the mr of the snwdpc can be classified as excellent level during the monitoring period from both seasonal and spatial patterns of evaluation the danjiangkou reservoir which serves as the water source for this project exhibited similar physicochemical parameters of water quality in 2014 when compared to this study table 3 indicating that the water quality of this reservoir has improved significantly in the past ten years due to pollution controls and management by the chinese government chen et al 2015 xin et al 2015 when comparing our results with the water quality of the danjiang and hanjiang rivers and other upper tributaries of the danjiangkou reservoir the concentrations of the tp nh3 n and fecal coliform in those rivers were relatively high which could present potential pollution risks for the water quality of the mr of the snwdpc liu et al 2018 the low bod5 and pi concentrations indicated a low organic pollution risk for the water quality of this project while both the annual average and station values showed a significant increasing trend for the tn these results showed a strong relationship with the water quality changes of the danjiangkou reservoir shen et al 2015 yin et al 2018 stated that the total water supply gradually increased after the project started resulting in increasing water levels in the danjiangkou reservoir and changes in the land use structure of its basin while the submerged farmland and mountain areas may cause the release of nitrogen phosphorus and other nutrients from the soil into the water some studies have found that the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus n p plays an important role in reflecting the nutrient structure of phytoplankton in water bodies chen et al 2018 gikas et al 2009 huang et al 2017 taylor and cunliffe 2016 the annual mean n p mass ratios from 2016 to 2018 in our study were 44 5 98 6 and 99 3 respectively while the ratios of the stations ranged from 85 48 to 94 39 some scholars have used the c n p ratio 106 16 1 atom ratio 41 7 1 mass ratio to evaluate the nutrient limitation state redfield et al 1963 however the optimum ratio of n p varies widely ranging from 4 to 133 in different water bodies gikas et al 2006 klausmeier et al 2004 although it was still difficult to determine that the phosphorus was the most critical limiting nutrient in the mr of the snwdpc the proliferation of algae in this project possibly caused by nutrient elements needs special attention in future monitoring work filstrup and downing 2017 anthropogenic activities such as sewage discharge land management and vehicle exhaust emissions play important roles in heavy metal concentration changes cheung et al 2003 li et al 2008 however as this project passes through villages and towns with low population densities and because strict real time monitoring and protection were always conducted along the canal the heavy metal parameters in the water remained relatively stable during the monitoring period compared with the three gorges reservoir table 3 indicating that the overall effect of human activities on heavy metals of this project was relatively low the average concentrations of cu se and as were less than 20 of the corresponding parameters measured at the danjiangkou reservoir in 2004 li et al 2008 while song et al found that the submerged land of the danjiangkou reservoir has not resulted in large scale heavy metal pollution in water bodies which was consistent with our results however some stations detected hg and as contents that were abnormally higher than the annual average concentrations liang et al 2017 reported the potential risk of several dumps and farms in the protected area on both sides of the main canal although no sewage was directly discharged into the water in this project the leachate generated by the dumps and farms could enter the canal through groundwater or runoff therefore further detailed investigation and strict control management of the risk sources around the main canal should be conducted 4 2 the selected key parameters of the wqimin models for the mr of the snwdpc according to the stepwise multiple linear regression analysis results the proposed wqimin model in this study for the mr of the snwdpc consists of five key water quality parameters i e tp f coli hg wt and do which showed very good performance for water quality evaluations the selected parameters of the wqimin model should be able to explain the overall variations and characteristics of water quality comprehensively and should be conducive for efficiently evaluating water quality with relative lower measurement costs pesce and wunderlin 2000 as the first parameter selected by the regression model tp provided the greatest contribution for explaining the wqi variations r2 0 60 p 0 001 which was consistent with the high nitrogen phosphorus ratios in the water body as discussed above in addition tn was not used as a parameter to calculate wqis in this study and the average nh3 n concentrations remained stable and were less than 40 of the tn content which was not a major contributor to the wqi variations therefore tp represented the nutritional parameters of water quality and reflected the uniqueness of this project relative to some other studies of lakes wu et al 2018 xu et al 2009 however other previous studies have reported the important impacts of the tp effect on the water quality of rivers and reservoirs hou et al 2016 kocer and sevgili 2014 the f coli shows the second highest explanatory value for the wqi variations which represent the physiochemical parameters of the water quality some studies have found that the f coli concentrations show obvious seasonal variation characteristics and that their peak values generally occur in summer and may be related to human health risks such as gastroenteritis gao et al 2016 the f coli concentrations in the hanjiang and danjiang rivers were relatively high and the water from these rivers flowed into the danjiangkou reservoir table 3 therefore this parameter could play a key role in affecting water quality changes and is used to indicate the impacts of anthropogenic activities and urban pollution risk sources chaudhary et al 2017 noble et al 2003 the hg was introduced into the regression model as the third parameter and is representative of the heavy metals affecting water quality that may provide potential risks to human health there are eight heavy metal parameters i e zn cu hg as se cd cr and pb contained in the basic items of the environmental quality standards for surface water of china china 2002a while our study involved five of them i e zn cu hg as and se in the wqi calculations because the cd cr and pb concentrations were quite low and have remained in a not detected status since december 2016 wu et al 2009 reported on the ubiquitous heavy metal problems throughout the yangtze river basin while gao et al found that the heavy metal concentrations in the three gorges reservoir located in the middle stream of the yangtze river were quite low and were acceptable for human consumption which was similar to the heavy metal concentration results obtained in our study our results indicated the notable achievements that the chinese government has made in water quality management and pollution control for large scale water conservancy and supply projects such as the three gorges reservoir dam and the mr of the snwdpc however many studies have indicated that hg and as pollutions have become global environmental issues due to their characteristics of easy transformation and bioaccumulation in the food chain giri and singh 2014 wiener et al 2006 therefore the changes in hg concentrations in this project still need close attention water temperature and dissolved oxygen were the fourth and fifth parameters selected into the wqimin model in this study respectively although the wt was assigned the lowest weight among all the parameters it became the fourth parameter to enter the regression model and reflected a good explanation of the wqi values the bod5 and do are important water quality parameters of special concern in previous studies jindal and sharma 2011 kannel et al 2007 despite the priority of bod5 being selected into the regression model before do based on the training data the calculation results showed that the wqimin model that included do performed better than those that included bod5 the main reason for this result can be attributed to the strict water quality management by the chinese government that causes the water body of this project to be free from organic pollution our calculation results from both the training and testing datasets also consistent with this phenomenon which is different from some research results on rivers or lakes that may be polluted by external sources such as sewage discharge singh et al 2005 when bod5 entered the wqimin model the rmse and pe values of the model increased by different degrees which indicated that bod5 cannot perform better than do as a key parameter for the wqimin model established in this study do is a parameter that can typically reflect water quality status and do can affect the growth of aquatic organisms and many complex biochemical processes many researchers have also used do as a key parameter in wqimin models for different water bodies kannel et al 2007 pesce and wunderlin 2000 sanchez et al 2007 4 3 the effects of the weights on the wqimin models the methods for setting weights and normalization factors may be important factors that differ from other research cases in the key water quality parameters selected of this study in early research the weights used in the wqi calculations were generally not considered in the wqimin models pesce and wunderlin 2000 simoes et al 2008 in later studies some scholars improved the water quality evaluation method based on the wqi while most of their studies considered the weights of the parameters in the wqimin models thus causing the results to be closer to the actual situations avigliano and schenone 2016 naveedullah et al 2016 our study comprehensively compared the performances of two wqimin models with and without weights based on the evaluation of the r2 rmse and pe values of the models using the same key parameters the results showed that the wqimin model that considered the weights could better explain the variations in wqis and had higher prediction accuracy for water quality assessment than the models without weights therefore we recommend the use of the wqimin model with weights to evaluate water quality additionally the determination of weights is affected by the personal experience and knowledge background of researchers which may to a certain extent have subjective effects noori et al 2019 therefore we suggest that in actual research the weights should be determined and adjusted on the basis of extensive literature reviews and according to the measured data and the background of the object to build a more realistic wqimin model 4 4 novelty challenges and future work the construction and operation of mega hydro projects are always drawn on extensive controversy and discussion as it had to faced and handled a wide range of challenges such as ecology and environmental protection national security and economic development zhao et al 2017 some comments pointed out that the negative effects of the pollution and environmental can make the snwdpc unsustainable and might well mark the nadir of mega hydro engineering solutions to china s water issues barnett et al 2015 from the perspective of water quality our research can explain and respond to some criticisms of this project proving a reliable evidence that the water quality of this project is excellent and stable which is different from some conclusions of previous studies that only rely on the investigation of its water source area the danjiangkou reservoir liu et al 2018 song et al 2017 additionally under the conditions of normal operation and stable water environment the wqimin model proposed in this study can evaluate the water quality status using the key parameters which has valuable application from the perspective of saving the measurement cost of parameters and improving the efficiency of evaluation certainly as with all the scientific research this study has obvious limitations first the data were observed in normal operating conditions rather than in a manipulative experiment thus some key environmental factors affecting the water quality variations may be ignored second due to the difference of domestic and international standards some special parameters e g the priority substances have not been tested and analysed in our monitoring which to some extent limited our understanding of their impact on human health and water quality hao et al 2018 considering that this project will continue to operate for many years different types of data such as priority substances and algal proliferation and or controlled in situ experiments may be required in this project in the future 5 conclusions the water quality status of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project of china from march 2016 to february 2019 and the spatio temporal variations of 16 parameters were studied and analysed in this article the wqi method was used to comprehensively evaluate the water quality from the seasonal and spatial patterns and the key water quality parameters were selected the main conclusions are as follows 1 the heavy metal parameters in the mr of the snwdpc have remained at stable low concentrations and satisfy the guidelines of the class i standard of china while all the physicochemical and nutrient parameters except the tn conformed to the class i or ii standards during the monitoring period showing the water quality of the project is better than that of most natural water bodies and can ensure the reliable and safe water supply demand to north china however the proliferation of algae in this project possibly caused by nutrient elements needs special attention 2 the water quality of the project maintained an excellent level with the mean wqi values of stations and seasons ranging from 90 17 to 90 71 and 87 67 to 91 82 respectively while summer is the season exhibiting the worst water quality with the lowest wqi values in each year 3 the proposed wqimin model in this study consisted of five key parameters i e the tp fecal coliform hg water temperature and dissolved oxygen and showed excellent performance for explaining and evaluating the water quality of this project especially when the parameter weights were considered in the wqi calculations indicating a valuable application for the saving of the parameter measurement cost and the improvement of the evaluation efficiency this study presented informative data useful models and methods for water quality management of the mr of the snwdpc and provided a reference for similar projects to determine key water quality parameters and to more efficiently evaluate water quality considering that this project will continue to supply water for many years and has a service population of more than 58 million people and far reaching impacts more research

17911,the effectiveness of algal solid liquid separation processes has been impacted by the strong influence of algal extracellular organic matter eom where the composition of proteins and carbohydrates and their associated interactions have been implicated however despite this no studies have analysed the detailed protein and carbohydrate composition in eom in relation to their impacts on separation hence the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the variety of carbohydrates and proteins present in the eom of select algal and cyanobacterial samples and the associated separation performance to better understand the influence of specific biopolymers the protein and carbohydrate composition of the eom of three species microcystis aeruginosa cs 555 1 chlorella vulgaris cs 42 7 and microcystis aeruginosa cs 564 01 previously observed to result in variable treatment performance were investigated the carbohydrates were analysed via high performance anion exchange chromatography hpaec with pulsed amperometric detection pad while the proteins were analysed using sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page combined with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms ten unique monosaccharides were identified of these the greatest proportion of charged uronic acid carbohydrates were present in the eom of m aeruginosa cs 564 01 the protein profiling revealed that m aeruginosa cs 564 01 had a greater proportion and concentration of proteins 75 kda when compared to m aeruginosa cs 555 1 or c vulgaris cs 42 7 it was determined that three serine and two threonine based proteins detected in greater concentrations in m aeruginosa cs 564 01 than cs 555 1 could covalently interact with carbohydrates ohenderson et al 2010a 2010b linked glycosylation these proteins have the ability to form numerous localised networks with carbohydrates and cells in the presence of coagulant molecules thereby providing a good hypothesis to explain the excellent treatment performance observed for m aeruginosa cs 564 01 previously it is proposed that the uronic acids in m aeruginosa cs 564 01 could interact with proteins via glycosylation explaining why the coagulant demand for this strain remained low despite the high charged carbohydrate concentration overall it is proposed that process performance could be impacted by a physicochemical characteristics and b carbohydrate protein interactions graphical abstract image 1 keywords acidic carbohydrates glycosylation hpaec pad lc ms glycoproteins 1 introduction solid liquid separation processes such as membrane filtration park et al 2013 sedimentation vandamme et al 2013 and flotation dissolved air flotation daf henderson et al 2010a and the novel posidaf process rao et al 2018a can be applied for the separation of algae in both water treatment and biotechnology applications in these processes chemical coagulants and flocculants are dosed to aid separation by adjusting the chemical characteristics of the particle surface and thus building larger flocs henderson et al 2008a pivokonsky et al 2016 however the extracellular and intracellular organic matter eom and iom respectively derived from algae can enhance or depress this process by interacting with coagulants and thereby altering the coagulant demand for the process as reviewed previously pivokonsky et al 2016 typically the process is designed to minimise cell lysis thus preventing the release of toxins and valuable organic compounds that form the iom hence the diverse separation efficiencies previously observed for differing species and strains has been attributed predominantly to the variable character and concentration of the eom henderson et al 2010b naceradska et al 2017 pivokonsky et al 2016 takaara et al 2007 eom comprises 80 of the total organic carbon in an algal sample including biopolymers carbohydrates and proteins humics and low molecular weight lmw compounds pivokonsky et al 2016 numerous studies have discussed the influence of eom biopolymeric character on coagulant demand and in turn the separation effectiveness of flotation rao et al 2018b vergnes et al 2019 sedimentation baldev et al 2015 guo et al 2013 vandamme et al 2013 and membrane pivokonsky et al 2016 villacorte et al 2013 processes for instance 90 separation efficiencies were obtained via coagulation flocculation gonzalez torres et al 2019 lama et al 2016 naceradska et al 2017 conventional daf henderson et al 2010a 2010b yap et al 2014 and the novel posidaf henderson et al 2010b rao et al 2018a 2018b processes during separation of some strains of microcystis aeruginosa attributed to the high mw protein rich eom acting as a polymer aid and reducing the coagulant demand for the process in an ultrafiltration study the carbohydrate concentration in the extracellular polymeric substances eps from chaetoceros affinis eom referred to as eps in membrane applications had a significant correlation r2 0 85 with membrane fouling hence understanding how coagulant demand and separation efficiencies are impacted by eom is contingent on characterising and understanding the eom biopolymer fraction traditionally biopolymer characterisation has been undertaken via total carbohydrate and protein measurements molecular weight mw hydrophobicity naceradska et al 2017 villacorte et al 2013 fluorescence spectroscopy fang et al 2010 qu et al 2012 and fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy chon et al 2013 gonzalez torres et al 2017 however these methods provide limited information on the molecular composition felz et al 2019 and the related impact on separation while previous studies have attempted to investigate the influence of biopolymers in terms of total concentration and physico chemical character on the treatment performance it has led to conflicting conclusions as to the influence of this fraction of algal organic matter on separation hence an in depth analysis of the eom carbohydrate and protein composition with advanced molecular characterisation techniques is necessary to gain an improved understanding of the complex underlying biopolymer related mechanisms that impact separation detailed analysis of microalgal carbohydrates requires advanced techniques such as hydrolysis followed by liquid chromatography felz et al 2019 one of which is the high performance anion exchange chromatography hpaec with pulsed amperometric detection pad hpaec pad provides the monosaccharide composition which is suitable for eom because a polysaccharides are essentially monosaccharides that are interlinked via glycosidic bonds delattre et al 2016 ouellette and rawn 2015 and b eom monosaccharide analysis has a higher accuracy compared to polysaccharide analysis delattre et al 2016 felz et al 2019 zhang et al 2012 this technique has been used for the carbohydrate characterisation from freshwater and marine algae and cyanobacteria delattre et al 2016 harazono et al 2011 templeton et al 2012 villay et al 2013 watanabe et al 2008 and hence would suit characterisation of algal eom carbohydrates detailed characterisation of eom proteins is complex and requires application of a series of techniques such as sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms battchikova et al 2018 contreras et al 2010 takaara et al 2019 previously these techniques have helped in understanding complex biopolymer mechanisms in the eom of algae and cyanobacteria debnath 2019 gallego et al 2018 takaara et al 2019 for example cellular iron uptake and microcystin production in m aeruginosa nies 478 was correlated to the strength of lectin carbohydrate interactions takaara et al 2019 however these techniques have not previously been used to assist in understanding separation processes by undertaking these complex analyses typically applied in algal biology and proteomics fields greater insight into the possible mechanisms by which separation is both enhanced and diminished by the biopolymer fraction could be achieved the main aim of this study was thus to explore the relationship between advanced eom biopolymer characteristics and treatment performance coagulant demand and separation efficiency to provide insights into the underlying biopolymer driven mechanisms that dictate algal separation to achieve this a detailed examination of the proteins and carbohydrates present in the eom of three algal and cyanobacterial strains that have been observed to result in variable treatment performance in previous studies was undertaken the species microcystis aeruginosa cs 555 1 chlorella vulgaris cs 42 7 and microcystis aeruginosa cs 564 01 had variable coagulant demands of 2 3 2 75 pg coagulant cell 1 high 1 9 2 4 pg coagulant cell 1 medium and 0 8 1 2 pg coagulant cell 1 low respectively henderson et al 2009 2015 2010b rao et al 2018b yap et al 2014 furthermore when separated via the novel posidaf process gonzalez torres et al 2014 rao et al 2018a the same species yielded only 10 30 low 50 70 medium and 95 high cell separation efficiencies respectively overall this paper establishes that advanced biopolymer characterisation can lend insight required to understand the physicochemical biopolymer interactions that influence separation process outcomes 2

cyanoabacteria known hereafter as cv ma555 and ma564 respectively were obtained from the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation s csiro australian national algae culture collection anacc hobart australia cv was re cultured in jaworski and both ma555 and ma564 in mla media rao et al 2018b the cultures were subjected to a 16 8 h light dark cycle with an associated temperature control of 21 c 15 c in 500 l pg 50 and pg 120 cycling incubators labec australia with a photosynthetic photon flux output of approximately 600 μmol m 2 s 1 multiple batches of each culture were grown in several 250 ml conical flasks in volumes of 100 ml cells were harvested for analysis at the time point 13 15 d marking the onset of the stationary growth phase as determined by cell counting via light microscope leica dm750 microscope switzerland and a haemocytometer 2 3 extracellular organic matter the eom was separated from the cells based on previously described methods gonzalez torres et al 2017 henderson et al 2008b 2010a pivokonsky et al 2014 briefly the cells were separated from eom by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 15 min with an allegra x 15r centrifuge beckman coulter australia henderson et al 2008b and then filtered using 934 ah glass microfiber filters 1 50 μm nominal pore size whatman usa to remove cell debris hence the samples used in this study comprised eom only and not iom which is consistent with other studies that have examined the impact of external eom on separation henderson et al 2010a naceradska et al 2017 pivokonsky et al 2006 rao et al 2018b the resulting eom fractions from each species were lyophilised prior to further analysis assays were conducted in triplicate using different culture batches 2 4 algal system characterisation 2 4 1 cell properties and bulk eom analysis to ensure that cell cultures were consistent with those previously examined cell properties and bulk eom analyses were undertaken as described previously gonzalez torres et al 2014 rao et al 2018a 2018b safarikova et al 2013 yap et al 2014 briefly cell counting was done via light microscopy leica dm750 microscope switzerland and a haemocytometer and cell size measurements via mastersizer 3000 malvern australia the zeta potential and charge of the cultures cells and eom and the eom were measured via zetasizer nano zs malvern uk and a particle charge detector pcd 04 travel mütek btg eclépens switzerland eom was first analysed with a toc vsch analyser shimadzu japan to determine its concentration as total organic carbon toc triplicate measurements were conducted using different culture batches and results expressed as a mean with one standard deviation 2 4 2 carbohydrate characterisation the total carbohydrate concentration in the filtered eom was quantified via the phenol sulphuric acid assay zhang et al 1999 the detailed carbohydrate analysis was conducted via the hpaec pad system dionex thermo scientific ics 4000 with as50 autosampler and ed50 detector usa samples for bulk and detailed characterisation were analysed in triplicate using different culture batches and results expressed as mean with one standard deviation refer si s1 1 for full procedure 2 4 3 protein characterisation prior to detailed protein profiling and analysis the total protein in the filtered eom of every species was quantified from three different culture batches using the modified lowry method frølund et al 1995 unless otherwise specified in this section triplicate analyses were conducted with multiple culture batches and results expressed as a mean with one standard deviation refer to si s1 2 for futher information 2 4 3 1 extraction of algal proteins the proteins from the eom were extracted via the ice cold acetone precipitation method air dried and re suspended in 50 μl of 50 mm trishcl buffer maintained at ph 8 the protein purity analysis was carried out using the bradford assay the extracted proteins were lyophilised prior to any further use or analysis 2 4 3 2 sds page analysis the protein profiling was carried out using the sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds

analysis of the species from different culture batches was conducted in triplicate using lc ms on two sets of samples a the lyophilised eom samples and b samples where the proteins were extracted based on the procedure outlined in section 2 4 3 1 refer full procedure in si s1 2 3 results 3 1 physicochemical characterisation of eom and comparison with eom extracted in previous studies ensuring that the eom extracted in the current study was of approximately similar character to that extracted in the relevant previous work was important to demonstrate there had been no significant change in starter culture character for the current and previously used cultures the dissolved organic carbon doc was within 7 10 mg l 1 and the eom biopolymer concentrations were between 3 and 7 mg l 1 and 1 3 mg l 1 for proteins and carbohydrates respectively si table s2 1 while the charge of the cv and ma555 cultures used in this study were similar to the cv and ma cultures used previously the charge of the ma564 culture used in this study was marginally more negative when compared to the previously characterised ma culture si table s2 1 overall the bulk physicochemical properties of the cultures and eom used in this study were largely similar to those used in previous separation studies thereby validating the evaluation of cultures used in this study for assessment of eom biopolymer influences in previous separation studies 3 2 carbohydrate characterisation among the seven neutral carbohydrates detected in this study six were common to the eom from all the species fig 1 fucose was the only neutral carbohydrate that was not observed in the eom of cv but was present in that of both m aeruginosa strains fig 1 the concentrations of the neutral carbohydrates in the eom varied greatly between the species fig 1 for example the concentration of glucose in the eom of ma555 was nearly 10 and 60 times higher than that found in the eom of ma564 and cv respectively and the arabinose concentration in eom of cv was 25 times greater than that found in the eom of both the m aeruginosa strains fig 1 overall these results demonstrated that carbohydrate production quantity and type was not only species but also strain dependent in the eom from ma555 and ma564 two acidic carbohydrates glucuronic acid and galacturonic acid were present fig 1 suggesting that acidic carbohydrates are commonly secreted by m aeruginosa strains which is in agreement with the literature bláhová et al 2013 nakagawa et al 1987 strycek et al 1992 villacorte et al 2015 the acidic carbohydrate concentrations were twice as high in the eom from ma564 when compared to ma555 which was in agreement with the results obtained for the same strains via transparent exopolymer particle tep analysis which is considered a surrogate measure of acidic carbohydrate villacorte et al 2013 in a previous study rao et al 2018b in contrast no acidic carbohydrates were detected in the eom of cv in this study fig 1 it is of note that acidic carbohydrates were previously detected in the eom of a us strain of chlorella vulgaris through ion exchange chromatography templeton et al 2012 and a german strain of c vulgaris via alcian blue staining discart et al 2013 suggesting that acidic carbohydrates are not exclusively absent from eom of all c vulgaris and that this is dependent on strain or growth condition cheng et al 2011 acidic carbohydrates have previously been implicated to impact the charge density of the eom for example residual acidic polysaccharides that were complexed with proteins extracted from the eom of tetraselmis sp caused a negative zeta potential of the isolated compound at ph 7 schwenzfeier et al 2013 in this study the measured charge of ma564 culture cells and eom and eom were highly negative when compared to ma555 culture and its eom and this corresponded with the elevated concentrations of acidic carbohydrates in ma564 tables 1 and si table s2 1 glucosamine was detected in eom of cv but was absent in eom from both strains of m aeruginosa tested fig 1 amino carbohydrates such as glucosamine have been previously identified in the eom of a us strain of c vulgaris templeton et al 2012 as well as in cell walls of a french strain of m aeruginosa bláhová et al 2013 lindsay et al 2009 however whether glucosamine was present in the organic matter secreted by the french m aeruginosa strain was unknown also from this study it was observed that concentrations of glucosamine in eom of cv were much less than that found in the eom of the us strain of c vulgaris utex 395 templeton et al 2012 at 0 5 μg mg 1 of lyophilised eom of cv in comparison to 5 2 μg mg 1 of lyophilised us strain eom respectively unlike the uronic acids the contribution of glucosamine to the culture charge density is negligible but with a caveat while the formal charge of glucosamine is 0 meq g 1 glucosamine behaves as a nucleophile the amine can become charged when donating its free electron pair in localised and weakly acidic environments and there is evidence regarding chelation of glucosamine with ferric ions during water treatment bhunia et al 2018 3 3 protein characterisation 3 3 1 profiling non algal standards and algal cyanobacterial proteins via mw and charge the protein profiles obtained via sds page differed between the protein standards and the algal and cyanobacterial derived eom samples as expected fig 2 the commercially available proteins had distinct concentrated bands indicative of increased concentration in the range of 50 70 kda for bsa and hsa and 8 23 kda for con a however the protein profiles for the algal and cyanobacterial extracted proteins presented concentrated clusters of bands at much lower molecular weights predominantly around 5 25 kda fig 2 furthermore the algal and cyanobacterial extracted protein also had much broader distribution of protein bands across the range of 5 250 kda in comparison to the non algal protein standards which had more narrow size distributions the eom extracted protein profiles from the algal and cyanobacterial species had several common and distinctive features fig 2 for instance the proteins extracted from the eom of both algal and cyanobacterial strains had protein bands above 75 kda range as well as some apparent clusters in the range of 50 kda fig 2 similar observations of bands in proteins from m aeruginosa strains from previous studies at positions of approximately 15 17 kda 50 kda 150 kda and 250 kda have been reported tonietto et al 2012 wei et al 2016 yamada et al 2012 there were also differences observed between the proteins extracted from the eom of algal and cyanobacterial strains in that the mw of the most intense bands of extracted proteins were around 5 25 kda and 45 kda for ma555 3 15 kda 20 25 kda and 37 50 kda for ma564 and around 10 15 kda for cv fig 2 between the three species more protein bands at high mw sizes of 75 250 kda were observed for ma564 strain that resulted in highest separation gonzalez torres et al 2014 rao et al 2018a relative to ma555 or cv however the bands were not as intense as that observed below 50 kda indicating that ma564 released proteins that were mostly 50 kda the sds page results were further supported by comparisons with the protein concentrations obtained through the exponentially modified protein abundance index empai values for all the species table 1 an empai value is a relative quantification of the specific protein in a mixture of proteins and is calculated based on the peptide matches in a database search result ishihama et al 2005 in this study the average empai values of the extracted proteins of ma555 for molecular weights under 50 kda were the highest among all the species tested and this corresponded well with the intense clustering of protein bands observed below 50 kda for the same strain fig 2 the proteins extracted from the eom of cyanobacteria ma564 and ma555 had a higher 70 number of proteins under 50 kda when compared to cv 45 which is a green algal species table 1 this contrasts with findings from prior research studies which observed that the mw of proteins in eom of m aeruginosa were predominantly 100 kda henderson et al 2008b pivokonsky et al 2006 2014 such differences might arise due to a the variation in strains of m aeruginosa which are likely to have differing eom compositions as highlighted in this study via the comparison of eom of ma555 and ma564 b protein loss during extraction due to the assay s sensitivity to the ionic strength of the solvents crowell et al 2013 c the presence or absence of polysaccharide moieties in the eom that interact with the proteins resulting in a misestimation of protein mw schwenzfeier et al 2014 or d the differences between the analytical methods used to analyse protein mw from the eom in various studies these differences therefore demonstrate the importance of conducting advanced protein characterisation to understand protein composition in the eom as well as identifying species to the strain level when the eom solutions and the extracted protein solutions from all species were compared based on charge table 1 it was observed that the charge densities of all the samples were negative and ranged from 1 40 0 20 meq g 1 highest eom of ma564 to 0 50 0 010 meq g 1 lowest eom extracted protein from cv it was also evident that the charge densities became less negative after the proteins were extracted when compared to the charge of the eom before protein extraction table 1 for instance the charge densities of eom solution of ma564 and extracted protein solution from ma564 were 1 40 0 20 meq g 1 and 0 90 0 010 meq g 1 respectively the variation in charge densities before and after protein extraction as well as that seen between ma564 and ma555 cultures si table s2 1 could be due to the charge contribution of the glucuronic and galacturonic acids present in eom of ma555 and ma564 as previously discussed fig 1 it has been previously documented that the presence of acidic polysaccharides in the protein fractions of european strain of tetraselmis sp caused the zeta potential to remain negative at ph 7 schwenzfeier et al 2013 however the charge reduction cannot be fully attributed to the loss of uronic acids alone after protein extraction because a decrease in charge was observed for the protein extracted from eom of cv even though no uronic acids were detected fig 1 this implies the possible loss of some other charged components or proteins during extraction see si section s3 for more information on protein loss after extraction 3 3 2 determination of functional protein composition and character when the eom from all three strains was analysed through lc ms over 260 distinct algal proteins were identified comprising enzymatic and non enzymatic proteins in almost equal proportions si tables s2 2 s2 7 the total number of proteins identified for each species and strain varied with 180 and 168 proteins found in the eom of ma555 and ma564 respectively but only 37 proteins in the eom of cv fig 3 the number of proteins from the eom of both m aeruginosa strains was relatively low in comparison to another study where 260 and 283 proteins were found in the eom of m aeruginosa pcc 7806 and pcc 7005 respectively alexova et al 2011 furthermore over 30 proteins detected in eom of ma555 and ma564 in this study were not secreted by chinese strains of m aeruginosa mayumi et al 2006 qi et al 2015 again highlighting the variability in eom composition produced by different strains of the same species comparisons between the three species revealed that no protein was commonly expressed between the eom of all three species although some proteins were found to be common to the eom of two of the strains tested fig 3 for instance 77 proteins were commonly expressed between the eom of ma555 and ma564 and one protein was commonly expressed between the eom of ma564 and cv nine different functional categories were identified from the list of proteins present in the eom of all strains the highest percentage of proteins identified were those involved in photosynthesis and respiration while the lowest proportion were identified as uncharacterised and hypothetical proteins fig 3 of interest were the proteins that could interact with carbohydrates a glycoproteins via o linked and n linked glycosylation b proteoglycans and c glycation via lectin carbohydrate interactions ernst et al 2008 glycosylation is the covalent addition of a glycan carbohydrate residue to the amide of an asparagine inside the endoplasmic reticulum termed an n linkage aebi 2013 or the oxygen of a serine or a threonine protein in the golgi apparatus termed an o linkage berg et al 2002 lodish et al 1995 both of these linkages are catalysed by enzymes to form non reversible protein carbohydrate globules known as glycoproteins berg et al 2002 previously interactions between glycoproteins and carbohydrates on the cell surface were suggested to cause colonial organisation of m aeruginosa in water systems frangeul et al 2008 from si tables s2 2 s2 7 no proteins that are known to be involved with n linked glycosylation were identified in any of the three strains however three serine and two threonine based proteins from cell envelope and biosynthesis groups that are known to be a part of o linked glycosylation berg et al 2002 were each found in the eom of ma555 si table s2 2 and ma564 si table s2 4 none of these proteins were found in eom of cv si table s2 6 the detected serine and threonine proteins predominantly had mw of 45 65 kda and of these serine hydroxymethyltransferase in ma564 had the highest empai value of 1 86 whereas all the others had empai values of 0 10 0 50 si tables 2 2 2 4 overall it is possible that these eom proteins may promote intercellular connections similar to microcystin related protein c which was found to be glycosylated through o linkages in the eom of m aeruginosa pcc 7806 zilliges et al 2008 2011 this would imply that covalent protein carbohydrate interactions may influence process performance as eom cell attachments are critical to cell separation when discussing covalent protein carbohydrate interactions it is important to note that proteoglycans compounds which are typically proteins covalently linked to amino carbohydrates and uronic acids were not evaluated as both uronic acids and amino carbohydrates were not detected in the same species tested in this study glycation is the reversible binding of lectins proteins to specific or multiple carbohydrates conjugation through hydrogen bonding berg et al 1999 and non polar interactions weis and drickamer 1996 even in the absence of enzymes ernst et al 2008 in this study no specific lectins such as microcystis aeruginosa m228 lectin or microvirin that have been previously observed in algae and cyanobacteria kehr and dittmann 2015 kehr et al 2006 sakamoto et al 1996 yamaguchi et al 1998 were found si table s2 2 s2 4 s2 6 however the enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase was found to be present in the eom of both m aeruginosa strains si table s2 2 s2 4 it is suggested that this enzyme could potentially reduce the di sulfide bonds in the methionine group in microvirin because the excision of the methionine group is a common post translational modification that occurs in bacterial lectins giglione and meinnel 2001 kort et al 1975 suggesting that this lectin may have been present overall as cell separation is dictated by biopolymer interactions it is possible that free carbohydrates identified in the eom could non covalently bind to these lectins and thus influence process efficiency 4 discussion analysis of the results demonstrated that the eom utilised 74 92 of the dosed coagulant table 2 when comparing the response of the different species and strains the coagulant demand for the culture and eom was in the order ma564 cv ma555 whereas the trends were reversed when analysing the posidaf cell separation efficiencies table 2 the variability in observed treatment performance trends across the species has been predominantly attributed to protein carbohydrate interactions which are a function of the differing biopolymer character in the eom henderson et al 2010a rao et al 2018b with this assertion contrasting the different species according to the detailed protein and carbohydrate character in the eom as ascertained in this study insights that improve our understanding of the dependence of treatment performance on species and strain are able to be gained as follows 4 1 the influences of biopolymer character on treatment performance the eom protein mw provides important clues to understand the variability in treatment performance across species when compared to the eom from cv or ma555 analysed in this study the eom from ma564 had a higher proportion 18 20 and empai 1 66 0 07 of proteins with mw 75 kda table 2 this characteristic is important because high mw proteins 75 kda can act as coagulant aids that network with coagulants algal cells and aom previously observed in the form of web like structures rao et al 2018b thereby reducing the coagulant demand and enhancing algal separation efficiency gonzalez torres et al 2019 henderson et al 2010a pivokonsky et al 2016 hence evaluating the eom protein mw is important when understanding the variability in separation efficiencies the coagulant interactions with biopolymers occur typically through electrostatic metal salt and polymers and bridging polymers only interactions hence charge density is another factor that can influence treatment performance previous research has shown that there is a greater propensity for coagulants to complex and chelate with uronic acids and glucosamine respectively when compared to neutral carbohydrates bhunia et al 2018 pivokonsky et al 2016 vandamme et al 2016 in this study the proportions of uronic acids or glucosamine in the eom were ranked in the order ma564 ma555 cv table 2 in terms of the protein charge the charge densities of the proteins extracted from the eom were greatest and least in ma564 and cv respectively table 2 these two observations collectively imply that the charge contribution of the eom biopolymers to the culture was greatest in ma564 and least in cv however the coagulant demand for the eom was in the order ma564 cv ma555 table 2 a possible explanation for this is that a larger proportion of uronic acids were interacting with or bound to proteins in ma564 eom when compared to the eom of ma555 and cv previously carbohydrate protein interactions were observed in the us strain of tetraselmis sp schwenzfeier et al 2014 and several marine microalgae xu et al 2017 and have been theorised to enhance separation of ma564 when compared to other species in posidaf rao et al 2018b and coagulation sedimentation gonzalez torres et al 2017 such carbohydrate protein interactions are further discussed in the following section 4 2 carbohydrate protein interactions and the associated implications for treatment performance carbohydrate protein interactions are suggested to occur covalently and non covalently and both types of interactions are critical to cell separation with respect to covalent interactions serine and threonine based proteins are essential for the formation of o linked glycoproteins three serine and two threonine based proteins were present in the eom of ma564 and ma555 but not in eom of cv table 2 however the associated empai of these proteins were higher in ma564 when compared to ma555 table 2 and hence could eventually result in the formation of higher concentrations of glycoproteins in the eom of ma564 when compared to eom from other species berg et al 2002 lodish et al 1995 as glycoproteins are molecules that are covalently bound to mono di or polysaccharides higher glycoprotein concentrations would explain the lower coagulant demand for ma564 when compared to the other species table 2 additionally higher empai of glycoprotein precursors could also result in glycoproteins with increased size and mw due to bonding with long chain carbohydrates and this could possibly benefit posidaf separation as suggested previously rao et al 2018b in a study that used coagulation flocculation sedimentation it was proposed that glycoproteins assisted cell separation by producing larger denser algal flocs that were prone to settling gonzalez torres et al 2017 another feature of glycoproteins is their ability to network with cells as extracellular glycoproteins formed multiple connections between carbohydrates on individual cells via o linkages in m aeruginosa frangeul et al 2008 zilliges et al 2008 2011 the formation of covalent carbohydrate protein bonds between cells and eom would mean that algal separation would be possible in the absence of coagulants however algal cell separation via coagulation flocculation gonzalez torres et al 2014 2019 and the posidaf process henderson et al 2010b rao et al 2018a 2018b yap et al 2014 was found to be negligible in the absence of coagulants hence it is hypothesised that in ma564 each glycoprotein molecule is networked only to a few cells and it was not until the addition of coagulant that several negatively charged glycoprotein cell networks electrostatically interacted with positively charged coagulant molecules to form web like networks that enhanced separation non covalent carbohydrate protein associations are usually reversible occurring via hydrogen bonding electrostatic van der waals and hydrophobic interactions and can be mediated by ca 2 zn 2 or mg 2 ions which are usually available in surface waters or the nutrient mix wang et al 2011 these ions form positive bridges between oxygen atoms of the carbohydrate hydroxyl group and negatively charged groups on proteins xiao et al 2018 and can influence process efficiencies neemann et al 2013 although lectins which non covalently interact with carbohydrates were not detected in the three strains used in this study table 2 a key characteristic of lectins is the ability to bind to carbohydrates on the cell surface which leads to cell agglutination singh et al 2017 cyanobacteria such as m aeruginosa have been observed to agglutinate yamaguchi et al 1998 2000 thereby implying that lectin carbohydrate interactions could influence eom cell attachments in species not evaluated in this study 5 conclusions this study indicates that detailed biopolymer characterisation must be undertaken to draw conclusions about the influence of the physicochemical interactions of biopolymers on coagulant demand and separation process efficiency specific conclusions are as follows acidic carbohydrates were detected in both strains of microcystis aeruginosa but not in chlorella vulgaris cs 42 7 and their concentrations were highest in microcystis aeruginosa cs 564 01 serine and threonine based proteins both of which are known to covalently interact with carbohydrates via o linked glycosylation were detected in both strains of m aeruginosa lectins that have been previously identified in cyanobacteria were not detected in this study however this does not rule out the presence of lectins in the species as detection of lectins can be hindered by enzymatic interferences biopolymeric influences on coagulant demand and separation process efficiencies can arise due to a synergy of competing physicochemical biopolymer characteristics such as a physical conditions such as concentrations mw and charge of the biopolymers b irreversible covalent carbohydrate protein interactions glycosylation and reversible non covalent carbohydrate protein interactions caused by hydrogen bonding van der waals or hydrophobic interactions the impact of biopolymers on the algal separation efficiency is not directed by any one factor or interaction rather the collective physio chemical interactions and biopolymer character influence separation process outcomes recommendations include testing the biopolymers identified in this study on a range of species with variable biopolymer character and treatment performance followed by the development of a model to better ascertain the complicated relationships between advanced biopolymer characteristics their interactions and treatment performance advanced analytical techniques such as x ray diffraction neutron scattering and surface plasmon resonance imaging could help determine the relative impact of one separation

17911,the effectiveness of algal solid liquid separation processes has been impacted by the strong influence of algal extracellular organic matter eom where the composition of proteins and carbohydrates and their associated interactions have been implicated however despite this no studies have analysed the detailed protein and carbohydrate composition in eom in relation to their impacts on separation hence the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the variety of carbohydrates and proteins present in the eom of select algal and cyanobacterial samples and the associated separation performance to better understand the influence of specific biopolymers the protein and carbohydrate composition of the eom of three species microcystis aeruginosa cs 555 1 chlorella vulgaris cs 42 7 and microcystis aeruginosa cs 564 01 previously observed to result in variable treatment performance were investigated the carbohydrates were analysed via high performance anion exchange chromatography hpaec with pulsed amperometric detection pad while the proteins were analysed using sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page combined with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms ten unique monosaccharides were identified of these the greatest proportion of charged uronic acid carbohydrates were present in the eom of m aeruginosa cs 564 01 the protein profiling revealed that m aeruginosa cs 564 01 had a greater proportion and concentration of proteins 75 kda when compared to m aeruginosa cs 555 1 or c vulgaris cs 42 7 it was determined that three serine and two threonine based proteins detected in greater concentrations in m aeruginosa cs 564 01 than cs 555 1 could covalently interact with carbohydrates ohenderson et al 2010a 2010b linked glycosylation these proteins have the ability to form numerous localised networks with carbohydrates and cells in the presence of coagulant molecules thereby providing a good hypothesis to explain the excellent treatment performance observed for m aeruginosa cs 564 01 previously it is proposed that the uronic acids in m aeruginosa cs 564 01 could interact with proteins via glycosylation explaining why the coagulant demand for this strain remained low despite the high charged carbohydrate concentration overall it is proposed that process performance could be impacted by a physicochemical characteristics and b carbohydrate protein interactions graphical abstract image 1 keywords acidic carbohydrates glycosylation hpaec pad lc ms glycoproteins 1 introduction solid liquid separation processes such as membrane filtration park et al 2013 sedimentation vandamme et al 2013 and flotation dissolved air flotation daf henderson et al 2010a and the novel posidaf process rao et al 2018a can be applied for the separation of algae in both water treatment and biotechnology applications in these processes chemical coagulants and flocculants are dosed to aid separation by adjusting the chemical characteristics of the particle surface and thus building larger flocs henderson et al 2008a pivokonsky et al 2016 however the extracellular and intracellular organic matter eom and iom respectively derived from algae can enhance or depress this process by interacting with coagulants and thereby altering the coagulant demand for the process as reviewed previously pivokonsky et al 2016 typically the process is designed to minimise cell lysis thus preventing the release of toxins and valuable organic compounds that form the iom hence the diverse separation efficiencies previously observed for differing species and strains has been attributed predominantly to the variable character and concentration of the eom henderson et al 2010b naceradska et al 2017 pivokonsky et al 2016 takaara et al 2007 eom comprises 80 of the total organic carbon in an algal sample including biopolymers carbohydrates and proteins humics and low molecular weight lmw compounds pivokonsky et al 2016 numerous studies have discussed the influence of eom biopolymeric character on coagulant demand and in turn the separation effectiveness of flotation rao et al 2018b vergnes et al 2019 sedimentation baldev et al 2015 guo et al 2013 vandamme et al 2013 and membrane pivokonsky et al 2016 villacorte et al 2013 processes for instance 90 separation efficiencies were obtained via coagulation flocculation gonzalez torres et al 2019 lama et al 2016 naceradska et al 2017 conventional daf henderson et al 2010a 2010b yap et al 2014 and the novel posidaf henderson et al 2010b rao et al 2018a 2018b processes during separation of some strains of microcystis aeruginosa attributed to the high mw protein rich eom acting as a polymer aid and reducing the coagulant demand for the process in an ultrafiltration study the carbohydrate concentration in the extracellular polymeric substances eps from chaetoceros affinis eom referred to as eps in membrane applications had a significant correlation r2 0 85 with membrane fouling hence understanding how coagulant demand and separation efficiencies are impacted by eom is contingent on characterising and understanding the eom biopolymer fraction traditionally biopolymer characterisation has been undertaken via total carbohydrate and protein measurements molecular weight mw hydrophobicity naceradska et al 2017 villacorte et al 2013 fluorescence spectroscopy fang et al 2010 qu et al 2012 and fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy chon et al 2013 gonzalez torres et al 2017 however these methods provide limited information on the molecular composition felz et al 2019 and the related impact on separation while previous studies have attempted to investigate the influence of biopolymers in terms of total concentration and physico chemical character on the treatment performance it has led to conflicting conclusions as to the influence of this fraction of algal organic matter on separation hence an in depth analysis of the eom carbohydrate and protein composition with advanced molecular characterisation techniques is necessary to gain an improved understanding of the complex underlying biopolymer related mechanisms that impact separation detailed analysis of microalgal carbohydrates requires advanced techniques such as hydrolysis followed by liquid chromatography felz et al 2019 one of which is the high performance anion exchange chromatography hpaec with pulsed amperometric detection pad hpaec pad provides the monosaccharide composition which is suitable for eom because a polysaccharides are essentially monosaccharides that are interlinked via glycosidic bonds delattre et al 2016 ouellette and rawn 2015 and b eom monosaccharide analysis has a higher accuracy compared to polysaccharide analysis delattre et al 2016 felz et al 2019 zhang et al 2012 this technique has been used for the carbohydrate characterisation from freshwater and marine algae and cyanobacteria delattre et al 2016 harazono et al 2011 templeton et al 2012 villay et al 2013 watanabe et al 2008 and hence would suit characterisation of algal eom carbohydrates detailed characterisation of eom proteins is complex and requires application of a series of techniques such as sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms battchikova et al 2018 contreras et al 2010 takaara et al 2019 previously these techniques have helped in understanding complex biopolymer mechanisms in the eom of algae and cyanobacteria debnath 2019 gallego et al 2018 takaara et al 2019 for example cellular iron uptake and microcystin production in m aeruginosa nies 478 was correlated to the strength of lectin carbohydrate interactions takaara et al 2019 however these techniques have not previously been used to assist in understanding separation processes by undertaking these complex analyses typically applied in algal biology and proteomics fields greater insight into the possible mechanisms by which separation is both enhanced and diminished by the biopolymer fraction could be achieved the main aim of this study was thus to explore the relationship between advanced eom biopolymer characteristics and treatment performance coagulant demand and separation efficiency to provide insights into the underlying biopolymer driven mechanisms that dictate algal separation to achieve this a detailed examination of the proteins and carbohydrates present in the eom of three algal and cyanobacterial strains that have been observed to result in variable treatment performance in previous studies was undertaken the species microcystis aeruginosa cs 555 1 chlorella vulgaris cs 42 7 and microcystis aeruginosa cs 564 01 had variable coagulant demands of 2 3 2 75 pg coagulant cell 1 high 1 9 2 4 pg coagulant cell 1 medium and 0 8 1 2 pg coagulant cell 1 low respectively henderson et al 2009 2015 2010b rao et al 2018b yap et al 2014 furthermore when separated via the novel posidaf process gonzalez torres et al 2014 rao et al 2018a the same species yielded only 10 30 low 50 70 medium and 95 high cell separation efficiencies respectively overall this paper establishes that advanced biopolymer characterisation can lend insight required to understand the physicochemical biopolymer interactions that influence separation process outcomes 2

cyanoabacteria known hereafter as cv ma555 and ma564 respectively were obtained from the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation s csiro australian national algae culture collection anacc hobart australia cv was re cultured in jaworski and both ma555 and ma564 in mla media rao et al 2018b the cultures were subjected to a 16 8 h light dark cycle with an associated temperature control of 21 c 15 c in 500 l pg 50 and pg 120 cycling incubators labec australia with a photosynthetic photon flux output of approximately 600 μmol m 2 s 1 multiple batches of each culture were grown in several 250 ml conical flasks in volumes of 100 ml cells were harvested for analysis at the time point 13 15 d marking the onset of the stationary growth phase as determined by cell counting via light microscope leica dm750 microscope switzerland and a haemocytometer 2 3 extracellular organic matter the eom was separated from the cells based on previously described methods gonzalez torres et al 2017 henderson et al 2008b 2010a pivokonsky et al 2014 briefly the cells were separated from eom by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 15 min with an allegra x 15r centrifuge beckman coulter australia henderson et al 2008b and then filtered using 934 ah glass microfiber filters 1 50 μm nominal pore size whatman usa to remove cell debris hence the samples used in this study comprised eom only and not iom which is consistent with other studies that have examined the impact of external eom on separation henderson et al 2010a naceradska et al 2017 pivokonsky et al 2006 rao

proteins were lyophilised prior to any further use or analysis 2 4 3 2 sds page analysis the protein profiling was carried out using the sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page method adapted from previous research barnett et al 2012 the sds page analysis was conducted in duplicate see si s1 2 for full procedure 2 4 3 3 mass spectrometry analysis a detailed protein analysis of the species from different culture batches was conducted in triplicate using lc ms on two sets of samples a the lyophilised eom samples and b samples where the proteins were extracted based on the procedure outlined in section 2 4 3 1 refer full procedure in si s1 2 3 results 3 1 physicochemical characterisation of eom and comparison with eom extracted in previous studies ensuring that the eom extracted in the current study was of approximately similar character to that extracted in the relevant previous work was important to demonstrate there had been no significant change in starter culture character for the current and previously used cultures the dissolved organic carbon doc was within 7 10 mg l 1 and the eom biopolymer concentrations were between 3 and 7 mg l 1 and 1 3 mg l 1 for proteins and carbohydrates respectively si table s2 1 while the charge of the cv and ma555 cultures used in this study were similar to the cv and ma cultures used previously the charge of the ma564 culture used in this study was marginally more negative when compared to the previously characterised ma culture si table s2 1 overall the bulk physicochemical properties of the cultures and eom used in this study were largely similar to those used in previous separation studies thereby validating the evaluation of cultures used in this study for assessment of eom biopolymer influences in previous separation studies 3 2 carbohydrate characterisation among the seven neutral carbohydrates detected in this study six were common to the eom from all the species fig 1 fucose was the only neutral carbohydrate that was not observed in the eom of cv but was present in that of both m aeruginosa strains fig 1 the concentrations of the neutral carbohydrates in the eom varied greatly between the species fig 1 for example the concentration of glucose in the eom of ma555 was nearly 10 and 60 times higher than that found in the eom of ma564 and cv respectively and the arabinose concentration in eom of cv was 25 times greater than that found in the eom of both the m aeruginosa strains fig 1 overall these results demonstrated that carbohydrate production quantity and type was not only species but also strain dependent in the eom from ma555 and ma564 two acidic carbohydrates glucuronic acid and galacturonic acid were present fig 1 suggesting that acidic carbohydrates are commonly secreted by m aeruginosa strains which is in agreement with the literature bláhová et al 2013 nakagawa et al 1987 strycek et al 1992 villacorte et al 2015 the acidic carbohydrate concentrations were twice as high in the eom from ma564 when compared to ma555 which was in agreement with the results obtained for the same strains via transparent exopolymer particle tep analysis which is considered a surrogate measure of acidic carbohydrate villacorte et al 2013 in a previous study rao et al 2018b in contrast no acidic carbohydrates were detected in the eom of cv in this study fig 1 it is of note that acidic carbohydrates were previously detected in the eom of a us strain of chlorella vulgaris through ion exchange chromatography templeton et al 2012 and a german strain of c vulgaris via alcian blue staining discart et al 2013 suggesting that acidic carbohydrates are not exclusively absent from eom of all c vulgaris and that this is dependent on strain or growth condition cheng et al 2011 acidic carbohydrates have previously been implicated to impact the charge density of the eom for example residual acidic polysaccharides that were complexed with proteins extracted from the eom of tetraselmis sp caused a negative zeta potential of the isolated compound at ph 7 schwenzfeier et al 2013 in this study the measured charge of ma564 culture cells and eom and eom were highly negative when compared to ma555 culture and its eom and this corresponded with the elevated concentrations of acidic carbohydrates in ma564 tables 1 and si table s2 1 glucosamine was detected in eom of cv but was absent in eom from both strains of m aeruginosa tested fig 1 amino carbohydrates such as glucosamine have been previously identified in the eom of a us strain of c vulgaris templeton et al 2012 as well as in cell walls of a french strain of m aeruginosa bláhová et al 2013 lindsay et al 2009 however whether glucosamine was present in the organic matter secreted by the french m aeruginosa strain was unknown also from this study it was observed that concentrations of glucosamine in eom of cv were much less than that found in the eom of the us strain of c vulgaris utex 395 templeton et al 2012 at 0 5 μg mg 1 of lyophilised eom of cv in comparison to 5 2 μg mg 1 of lyophilised us strain eom respectively unlike the uronic acids the contribution of glucosamine to the culture charge density is negligible but with a caveat while the formal charge of glucosamine is 0 meq g 1 glucosamine behaves as a nucleophile the amine can become charged when donating its free electron pair in localised and weakly acidic environments and there is evidence regarding chelation of glucosamine with ferric ions during water treatment bhunia et al 2018 3 3 protein characterisation 3 3 1 profiling non algal standards and algal cyanobacterial proteins via mw and charge the protein profiles obtained via sds page differed between the protein standards and the algal and cyanobacterial derived eom samples as expected fig 2 the commercially available proteins had distinct concentrated bands indicative of increased concentration in the range of 50 70 kda for bsa and hsa and 8 23 kda for con a however the protein profiles for the algal and cyanobacterial extracted proteins presented concentrated clusters of bands at much lower molecular weights predominantly around 5 25 kda fig 2 furthermore the algal and cyanobacterial extracted protein also had much broader distribution of protein bands across the range of 5 250 kda in comparison to the non algal protein standards which had more narrow size distributions the eom extracted protein profiles from the algal and cyanobacterial species had several common and distinctive features fig 2 for instance the proteins extracted from the eom of both algal and cyanobacterial strains had protein bands above 75 kda range as well as some apparent clusters in the range of 50 kda fig 2 similar observations of bands in proteins from m aeruginosa strains from previous studies at positions of approximately 15 17 kda 50 kda 150 kda and 250 kda have been reported tonietto et al 2012 wei et al 2016 yamada et al 2012 there were also differences observed between the proteins extracted from the eom of algal and cyanobacterial strains in that the mw of the most intense bands of extracted proteins were around 5 25 kda and 45 kda for ma555 3 15 kda 20 25 kda and 37 50 kda for ma564 and around 10 15 kda for cv fig 2 between the three species more protein bands at high mw sizes of 75 250 kda were observed for ma564 strain that resulted in highest separation gonzalez torres et al 2014 rao et al 2018a relative to ma555 or cv however the bands were not as intense as that observed below 50 kda indicating that ma564 released proteins that were mostly 50 kda the sds page results were further supported by comparisons with the protein concentrations obtained through the exponentially modified protein abundance index empai values for all the species table 1 an empai value is a relative quantification of the specific protein in a mixture of proteins and is calculated based on the peptide matches in a database search result ishihama et al 2005 in this study the average empai values of the extracted proteins of ma555 for molecular weights under 50 kda were the highest among all the species tested and this corresponded well with the intense clustering of protein bands observed below 50 kda for the same strain fig 2 the proteins extracted from the eom of cyanobacteria ma564 and ma555 had a higher 70 number of proteins under 50 kda when compared to cv 45 which is a green algal species table 1 this contrasts with findings from prior research studies which observed that the mw of proteins in eom of m aeruginosa were predominantly 100 kda henderson et al 2008b pivokonsky et al 2006 2014 such differences might arise due to a the variation in strains of m aeruginosa which are likely to have differing eom compositions as highlighted in this study via the comparison of eom of ma555 and ma564 b protein loss during extraction due to the assay s sensitivity to the ionic strength of the solvents crowell et al 2013 c the presence or absence of polysaccharide moieties in the eom that interact with the proteins resulting in a misestimation of protein mw schwenzfeier et al 2014 or d the differences between the analytical methods used to analyse protein mw from the eom in various studies these differences therefore demonstrate the importance of conducting advanced protein characterisation to understand protein composition in the eom as well as identifying species to the strain level when the eom solutions and the extracted protein solutions from all species were compared based on charge table 1 it was observed that the charge densities of all the samples were negative and ranged from 1 40 0 20 meq g 1 highest eom of ma564 to 0 50 0 010 meq g 1 lowest eom extracted protein from cv it was also evident that the charge densities became less negative after the proteins were extracted when compared to the charge of the eom before protein extraction table 1 for instance the charge densities of eom solution of ma564 and extracted protein solution from ma564 were 1 40 0 20 meq g 1 and 0 90 0 010 meq g 1 respectively the variation in charge densities before and after protein extraction as well as that seen between ma564 and ma555 cultures si table s2 1 could be due to the charge contribution of the glucuronic and galacturonic acids present in eom of ma555 and ma564 as previously discussed fig 1 it has been previously documented that the presence of acidic polysaccharides in the protein fractions of european strain of tetraselmis sp caused the zeta potential to remain negative at ph 7 schwenzfeier et al 2013 however the charge reduction cannot be fully attributed to the loss of uronic acids alone after protein extraction because a decrease in charge was observed for the protein extracted from eom of cv even though no uronic acids were detected fig 1 this implies the possible loss of some other charged components or proteins during extraction see si section s3 for more information on protein loss after extraction 3 3 2 determination of functional protein composition and character when the eom from all three strains was analysed through lc ms over 260 distinct algal proteins were identified comprising enzymatic and non enzymatic proteins in almost equal proportions si tables s2 2 s2 7 the total number of proteins identified for each species and strain varied with 180 and 168 proteins found in the eom of ma555 and ma564 respectively but only 37 proteins in the eom of cv fig 3 the number of proteins from the eom of both m aeruginosa strains was relatively low in comparison to another study where 260 and 283 proteins were found in the eom of m aeruginosa pcc 7806 and pcc 7005 respectively alexova et al 2011 furthermore over 30 proteins detected in eom of ma555 and ma564 in this study were not secreted by chinese strains of m aeruginosa mayumi et al 2006 qi et al 2015 again highlighting the variability in eom composition produced by different strains of the same species comparisons between the three species revealed that no protein was commonly expressed between the eom of all three species although some proteins were found to be common to the eom of two of the strains tested fig 3 for instance 77 proteins were commonly expressed between the eom of ma555 and ma564 and one protein was commonly expressed between the eom of ma564 and cv nine different functional categories were identified from the list of proteins present in the eom of all strains the highest percentage of proteins identified were those involved in photosynthesis and respiration while the lowest proportion were identified as uncharacterised and hypothetical proteins fig 3 of interest were the proteins that could interact with carbohydrates a glycoproteins via o linked and n linked glycosylation b proteoglycans and c glycation via lectin carbohydrate interactions ernst et al 2008 glycosylation is the covalent addition of a glycan carbohydrate residue to the amide of an asparagine inside the endoplasmic reticulum termed an n linkage aebi 2013 or the oxygen of a serine or a threonine protein in the golgi apparatus termed an o linkage berg et al 2002 lodish et al 1995 both of these linkages are catalysed by enzymes to form non reversible protein carbohydrate globules known as glycoproteins berg et al 2002 previously interactions between glycoproteins and carbohydrates on the cell surface were suggested to cause colonial organisation of m aeruginosa in water systems frangeul et al 2008 from si tables s2 2 s2 7 no proteins that are known to be involved with n linked glycosylation were identified in any of the three strains however three serine and two threonine based proteins from cell envelope and biosynthesis groups that are known to be a part of o linked glycosylation berg et al 2002 were each found in the eom of ma555 si table s2 2 and ma564 si table s2 4 none of these proteins were found in eom of cv si table s2 6 the detected serine and threonine proteins predominantly had mw of 45 65 kda and of these serine hydroxymethyltransferase in ma564 had the highest empai value of 1 86 whereas all the others had empai values of 0 10 0 50 si tables 2 2 2 4 overall it is possible that these eom proteins may promote intercellular connections similar to microcystin related protein c which was found to be glycosylated through o linkages in the eom of m aeruginosa pcc 7806 zilliges et al 2008 2011 this would imply that covalent protein carbohydrate interactions may influence process performance as eom cell attachments are critical to cell separation when discussing covalent protein carbohydrate interactions it is important to note that proteoglycans compounds which are typically proteins covalently linked to amino carbohydrates and uronic acids were not evaluated as both uronic acids and amino carbohydrates were not detected in the same species tested in this study glycation is the reversible binding of lectins proteins to specific or multiple carbohydrates conjugation through hydrogen bonding berg et al 1999 and non polar interactions weis and drickamer 1996 even in the absence of enzymes ernst et al 2008 in this study no specific lectins such as microcystis aeruginosa m228 lectin or microvirin that have been previously observed in algae and cyanobacteria kehr and dittmann 2015 kehr et al 2006 sakamoto et al 1996 yamaguchi et al 1998 were found si table s2 2 s2 4 s2 6 however the enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase was found to be present in the eom of both m aeruginosa strains si table s2 2 s2 4 it is suggested that this enzyme could potentially reduce the di sulfide bonds in the methionine group in microvirin because the excision of the methionine group is a common post translational modification that occurs in bacterial lectins giglione and meinnel 2001 kort et al 1975 suggesting that this lectin may have been present overall as cell separation is dictated by biopolymer interactions it is possible that free carbohydrates identified in the eom could non covalently bind to these lectins and thus influence process efficiency 4 discussion analysis of the results demonstrated that the eom utilised 74 92 of the dosed coagulant table 2 when comparing the response of the different species and strains the coagulant demand for the culture and eom was in the order ma564 cv ma555 whereas the trends were reversed when analysing the posidaf cell separation efficiencies table 2 the variability in observed treatment performance trends across the species has been predominantly attributed to protein carbohydrate interactions which are a function of the differing biopolymer character in the eom henderson et al 2010a rao et al 2018b with this assertion contrasting the different species according to the detailed protein and carbohydrate character in the eom as ascertained in this study insights that improve our understanding of the dependence of treatment performance on species and strain are able to be gained as follows 4 1 the influences of biopolymer character on treatment performance the eom protein mw provides important clues to understand the variability in treatment performance across species when compared to the eom from cv or ma555 analysed in this study the eom from ma564 had a higher proportion 18 20 and empai 1 66 0 07 of proteins with mw 75 kda table 2 this characteristic is important because high mw proteins 75 kda can act as coagulant aids that network with coagulants algal cells and aom previously observed in the form of web like structures rao et al 2018b thereby reducing the coagulant demand and enhancing algal separation efficiency gonzalez torres et al 2019 henderson et al 2010a pivokonsky et al 2016 hence evaluating the eom protein mw is important when understanding the variability in separation efficiencies the coagulant interactions with biopolymers occur typically through electrostatic metal salt and polymers and bridging polymers only interactions hence charge density is another factor that can influence treatment performance previous research has shown that there is a greater propensity for coagulants to complex and chelate with uronic acids and glucosamine respectively when compared to neutral carbohydrates bhunia et al 2018 pivokonsky et al 2016 vandamme et al 2016 in this study the proportions of uronic acids or glucosamine in the eom were ranked in the order ma564 ma555 cv table 2 in terms of the protein charge the charge densities of the proteins extracted from the eom were greatest and least in ma564 and cv respectively table 2 these two observations collectively imply that the charge contribution of the eom biopolymers to the culture was greatest in ma564 and least in cv however the coagulant demand for the eom was in the order ma564 cv ma555 table 2 a possible explanation for this is that a larger proportion of uronic acids were interacting with or bound to proteins in ma564 eom when compared to the eom of ma555 and cv previously carbohydrate protein interactions were observed in the us strain of tetraselmis sp schwenzfeier et al 2014 and several marine microalgae xu et al 2017 and have been theorised to enhance separation of ma564 when compared to other species in posidaf rao et al 2018b and coagulation sedimentation gonzalez torres et al 2017 such carbohydrate protein interactions are further discussed in the following section 4 2 carbohydrate protein interactions and the associated implications for treatment performance carbohydrate protein interactions are suggested to occur covalently and non covalently and both types of interactions are critical to cell separation with respect to covalent interactions serine and threonine based proteins are essential for the formation of o linked glycoproteins three serine and two threonine based proteins were present in the eom of ma564 and ma555 but not in eom of cv table 2 however the associated empai of these proteins were higher in ma564 when compared to ma555 table 2 and hence could eventually result in the formation of higher concentrations of glycoproteins in the eom of ma564 when compared to eom from other species berg et al 2002 lodish et al 1995 as glycoproteins are molecules that are covalently bound to mono di or polysaccharides higher glycoprotein concentrations would explain the lower coagulant demand for ma564 when compared to the other species table 2 additionally higher empai of glycoprotein precursors could also result in glycoproteins with increased size and mw due to bonding with long chain carbohydrates and this could possibly benefit posidaf separation as suggested previously rao et al 2018b in a study that used coagulation flocculation sedimentation it was proposed that glycoproteins assisted cell separation by producing larger denser algal flocs that were prone to settling gonzalez torres et al 2017 another feature of glycoproteins is their ability to network with cells as extracellular glycoproteins formed multiple connections between carbohydrates on individual cells via o linkages in m aeruginosa frangeul et al 2008 zilliges et al 2008 2011 the formation of covalent carbohydrate protein bonds between cells and eom would mean that algal separation would be possible in the absence of coagulants however algal cell separation via coagulation flocculation gonzalez torres et al 2014 2019 and the posidaf process henderson et al 2010b rao et al 2018a 2018b yap et al 2014 was found to be negligible in the absence of coagulants hence it is hypothesised that in ma564 each glycoprotein molecule is networked only to a few cells and it was not until the addition of coagulant that several negatively charged glycoprotein cell networks electrostatically interacted with positively charged coagulant molecules to form web like networks that enhanced separation non covalent carbohydrate protein associations are usually reversible occurring via hydrogen bonding electrostatic van der waals and hydrophobic interactions and can be mediated by ca 2 zn 2 or mg 2 ions which are usually available in surface waters or the nutrient mix wang et al 2011 these ions form positive bridges between oxygen atoms of the carbohydrate hydroxyl group and negatively charged groups on proteins xiao et al 2018 and can influence process efficiencies neemann et al 2013 although lectins which non covalently interact with carbohydrates were not detected in the three strains used in this study table 2 a key characteristic of lectins is the ability to bind to carbohydrates on the cell surface which leads to cell agglutination singh et al 2017 cyanobacteria such as m aeruginosa have been observed to agglutinate yamaguchi et al 1998 2000 thereby implying that lectin carbohydrate interactions could influence eom cell attachments in species not evaluated in this study 5 conclusions this study indicates that detailed biopolymer characterisation must be undertaken to draw conclusions about the influence of the physicochemical interactions of biopolymers on coagulant demand and separation process efficiency specific conclusions are as follows acidic carbohydrates were detected in both strains of microcystis aeruginosa but not in chlorella vulgaris cs 42 7 and their concentrations were highest in microcystis aeruginosa cs 564 01 serine and threonine based proteins both of which are known to covalently interact with carbohydrates via o linked glycosylation were detected in both strains of m aeruginosa lectins that have been previously identified in cyanobacteria were not detected in this study however this does not rule out the presence of lectins in the species as detection of lectins can be hindered by enzymatic interferences biopolymeric influences on coagulant demand and separation process efficiencies can arise due to a synergy of competing physicochemical biopolymer characteristics such as a physical conditions such as concentrations mw and charge of the biopolymers b irreversible covalent carbohydrate protein interactions glycosylation and reversible non covalent carbohydrate protein interactions caused by hydrogen bonding van der waals or hydrophobic interactions the impact of biopolymers on the algal separation efficiency is not directed by any one factor or interaction rather the collective physio chemical interactions and biopolymer character influence separation process outcomes recommendations include testing the biopolymers identified in this study on a range of species with variable biopolymer character and treatment performance followed by the development of a model to better ascertain the complicated relationships between advanced biopolymer characteristics their interactions and treatment performance advanced analytical techniques such as x ray diffraction neutron scattering and surface plasmon resonance imaging could help determine the relative impact of one separation

17912,ecotoxicological risk of zno nanoparticles at environmental levels is a key knowledge gap for predicting how freshwater ecosystems will respond to nanoparticle pollution a microcosm experiment was conducted to explore the chronic effects of zno nanoparticle at environmental concentrations 30 300 3000 ng l 1 on aquatic fungi associated with the decomposing process of poplar leaf litter 45 days zno nanoparticles led to 9 33 increases in fungal biomass after acute exposure 5 days but 33 50 decreases after chronic exposure 45 days indicating that the hormetic effect of zno nanoparticles at the environmental level may occur during acute exposure besides zno nanoparticles had negative effects on microbial enzyme activity especially on day 10 when the activities of n acetylglucosaminidase glycine aminopeptidase aryl sulfatase polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase were significantly inhibited after chronic exposure the fungal community structure was significantly impacted by zno nanoparticles at 300 ng l 1 due to the reduced proportion of anguillospora which eventually caused a significant decrease in litter decomposition rate therefore zno nanoparticles may pose ecotoxicological effects on aquatic fungi even at a very low concentration and eventually negatively affect freshwater functioning keywords environmental concentration zno nanoparticles fungal biomass enzyme activity fungal community structure 1 introduction leaf litter is an important nutrient input of streams and its decomposition is a key driver of carbon cycling which links riparian plants microorganisms and invertebrates baldy et al 2010 dighton 1997 the microbial decomposers especially aquatic fungi assume dominant roles in leaf litter decomposition kuehn et al 1999 as a functional community fungi can produce and secrete an array of extracellular enzymes that participate in leaf degradation kuehn 2016 suberkropp 1991 2001 the rate of litter decomposition can be affected by environmental stressors by altering community structures and activities of fungi webster and benfield 1986 therefore it is essential to understand the effect of contaminants on aquatic fungi to allow predicting ecosystem response to environmental stressors due to high specific surface and other unique physiochemical properties garcía gómez et al 2017 nanoparticles nps are

used in industrial products bondarenko et al 2013 and numerous studies have investigated the nzno toxicity on aquatic organisms such as algae bhuvaneshwari et al 2015 crustacean bacchetta et al 2017 and fish chupani et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 the toxic mechanisms are generally attributed to three aspects i release of ionic zn ii increase in oxidative stress and iii its physicochemical properties cupi et al 2015 ma et al 2013 besides our previous studies showed that the effects of nzno on leaf litter decomposition were depended on its particle size du et al 2017a and concentration du et al 2019 in natural water however these investigations are based on the experiments that were conducted on nzno concentrations from 1 to 1000 mg l 1 bai et al 2009 hao and chen 2012 khosravi katuli et al 2018 instead of taking into account the potential effects of nzno at environmental relevant level so such observation may have provided overestimated results on nzno impacts due to the much higher analyzed concentration than the estimated environment concentrations surface water 10 ng l 1 and treated wastewater 430 ng l 1 al mahrouqi et al 2018 gottschalk et al 2009 ma et al 2013 therefore the present study explored the potential effects of nzno at environmental concentrations 30 300 and 3000 ng l 1 on leaf litter decomposition to comprehensively evaluate the consequences of the realistic environmental exposure scenarios to capture effects of nzno at environmental levels on leaf litter decomposition mediated by aquatic fungi we chose fungal biomass nine enzymatic activities and community structure as integrative variables reflecting fungal activity and used litter decomposition rate and litter chemical components to comprehensively target the ecological consequence of litter decomposition driven by aquatic fungi information on the comparative effect across different environmental concentrations of nzno will help us to better understand the impacts of nzno on freshwater

emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem jsm 7001f which showed that the size of nzno ranged from 50 to 100 nm in stock dispersion fig s1 2 2 leaf collection and conditioning poplar populus nigra

erlenmeyer flask with 80 ml arfw du et al 2017a the experimental design involved three levels of nzno addition 30 300 and 3000 ng l 1 and three corresponding levels of znso4 30 300 and 3000 ng l 1 addition as positive controls of ionic zn the microcosms without nzno or znso4 were conducted as negative controls all treatments were replicated three times and the additional microcosms not

concentration of ionic zn varied with zn type and exposure time table 1 generally ionic zn concentration decreased with exposure time in arfw with znso4 but the opposite trend was observed in arfw with nzno except for 3000 ng l 1 as a result the concentrations of ionic zn released by nzno were significantly lower than znso4 before 3 days table 1 p 0 05 3 2 impacts on litter decomposition rate overall the litter decayed faster in the microcosms with znso4 after 45 day exposure which was reflected in the significant increase in decomposition rate compared to the control 33 73 fig 1 p 0 05 znso4 at 300 ng l 1 caused the highest decomposition rate 0 57 month 1 fig 1 p 0 05 for exposure of nzno promoting effect on leaf decomposition was only observed in the microcosms with nzno at 30 ng l

a significant increase and decrease in litter c n ratio was observed in the microcosms with nzno at 300 ng l 1 and znso4 at 3000 ng l 1 respectively fig 2 p 0 05 3 4 impacts on eea a significant interactive effect of zn type concentration time could be found on eea table s2 p 0 01 there was also a remarkable enzymatic variation among zn type concentration time fig 3 the first two components

positively correlated with lap but negatively correlated with ars as such pc1 and pc2 were represented as functional properties of tissue consumption and nutrient mining in subsequent analyses fig 3 showed that microbial tissue consumption was promoted by znso4 but inhibited by nzno for pc1 exposure of nzno at 30 and 300 ng l 1 resulted in significant decreases in activities of these correlated enzymes on day 5 the reduction of these enzymes was also observed in the microcosms with nzno on day 10 30 3000 ng l 1 15 3000 ng l 1 and 45 300 and 3000 ng l 1 on the contrary exposure of znso4 led to increases in these correlated enzyme activities except for 3000 ng l 1 znso4 on day 45 also it can be seen that nitrogen mining was promoted by nzno but inhibited by znso4 for pc2 exposure of nzno caused a decrease in lap on day 5 30 and 300 ng l 1 10 300 and 3000 ng l 1 and 45 300 and 3000 ng l 1 the reduction of lap was also observed in the microcosms with znso4 on day 5 30 3000 ng l 1 15 30

concentrations of nzno and znso4 in the control microcosms fungal biomass gradually increased with litter decomposing time on day 5 nzno showed promoting effect on fungal biomass especially at 30 and 300 ng l 1 which led to 33 and 20 increase respectively fig 4 p 0 05 while znso4 caused 29 34 decrease in fungal biomass fig 4 p 0 05 on day 15 both nzno and znso4 at 30 ng l 1 increased fungal biomass by 56 and 160 respectively fig 4 p 0 05 the nzno at 3000 ng l 1 significantly inhibited fungal biomass in contrast znso4 at the same concentration led to a 62 increase in fungal biomass fig 4 p 0 05 on day 40 significant reductions of fungal biomass were detected in all microcosms with nzno and znso4 fig 4 p 0 05 3 6 aquatic fungal community from the 18s rdna sequencing more than 55 371 reads with 216 bp length were obtained from each sample the number of otus at 97 sequence identity ranged from 72 to 221 species richness indices indicated that the number of outs in the treatments increased compared with the control the diversity indices also showed that the fungal diversity is enhanced in the microcosms with nzno and znso4 for example nzno at 300 ng l 1 led to a 55 increase in the shannon index of the aquatic fungal community table 2 in initially samples the dominant fungal genus was assigned as unclassified fungi fig 5 after 45 day exposure substantial differences in the fungal community structures were detected from microcosms exposed to nzno and znso4 in the control microcosms anguillospora 37 33 unclassified fungi 20 86 tetracladium 16 98 and alternaria 13 64 were among the main genera detected fig 5 anguillospora 48 65 ciliophora 4 49 and unclassified helotiales 6 36 were present in increased proportions after exposure of nzno at 30 ng l 1 compared with the control whereas the position of tetracladium and alternaria was reduced to 10 97 and 0 03 respectively the increased proportion of unclassified fungi 51 33 pseudohalonectria 8 54 and unclassified norank helotiales 6 92 and the decreased abundance of tetracladium 11 90 alternaria 0 02 unclassified pleosporales 0 03 and unclassified helotiales 0 68 were detected in the microcosms with nzno at 300 ng l 1 in addition to anguillospora and unclassified fungi ciliophora and unclassified pleosporales became the dominant fungi after exposure to znso4 especially in the microcosms with znso4 at 300 ng l 1 the proportion of ciliophora and unclassified pleosporales increased to 31 53 and 4 53 respectively whereas the abundance of tetracladium and alternaria was reduced to 0 and 3 21 respectively compared to the control little differentiation among fungal communities exposed to different concentrations of nzno and znso4 was demonstrated by nmds fig 6 notably a distinct fungal community had developed in the microcosms with nzno at 300 l 1 lefse detected differentially abundant aquatic fungal taxa α 0 01 lda score 2 on various phylogenetic levels fig 7 unclassified leotiomycetes was overrepresented in the control microcosms while unclassified pleosporales and mycosphaerella tassiana became the key fungus after exposure of nzno at 30 and 300 ng l 1 respectively meanwhile pyrenochaetopsis leptospora and anguillospora longissima were enriched in the microcosms with nzno at 3000 ng l 1 4 discussion most ecotoxicological assessments of nzno effects on freshwater functioning to date focus on high concentration treatments du et al 2017a 2019 which may not readily be extended to the more likely scenario of low concentration exposures effects of nzno at environmental levels on leaf litter decomposition mediated by aquatic fungi were evaluated in the present study and our results provide compelling evidence that aquatic fungi are sensitive to nzno exposure even at very low concentrations with complicated consequences for biogeochemical process in freshwater ecosystems one important insight from our experiment is that acute 5 days and chronic 45 days exposure of nzno had opposite effects on fungal biomass the stimulatory effect of toxic chemicals at low concentration on organismal metabolism is referred to as a hormetic effect calabrese 2008 the increase in fungal biomass might be attributed to the hormetic effect of nzno on aquatic fungi similar effect of nzno has been shown for various organisms such as raphanus sativus brassica rapus tetrahymena thermophile and eisenia fetida in previous studies bondarenko et al 2013 li et al 2011 lin and xing 2007 but our study firstly demonstrate that nzno at very low concentrations may have hermetic effects on aquatic fungi and chronic exposure will alleviate this promotion even shift it to damaging effect another notable consequence is that aquatic fungi were more sensitive to znso4 than to nzno after acute exposure 5 days which was reflected in the significant decreases of fungal biomass fig 4 p 0 05 this outcome might be due to the higher initial concentration of ionic zn table 1 which achieved to the toxic level to aquatic fungi in contrast the process of nzno dissolution led to much lower concentrations of ionic zn before 3 days which reduced the initially toxic potential of nzno despite its damaging effect on fungal biomass znso4 led to clearly promoting effects on activities of most microbial enzymes fig 3 fig s2 although previous studies have demonstrated decreases in microbial enzymatic activity due to zn pollution the zn concentrations used in those studies were one or two orders of magnitude higher than in our experiment zn is an important component of enzymes for protein synthesis and energy production hansch and mendel 2009 additionally some extracellular hydrolytic activities are dependent on zn such as nucleases aminopeptidases peptide deformylases serero et al 2001 α mannosidase snaith and levvy 1968 and metalloproteinases maidment et al 1999 we speculate that zn at such low concentration in our study might act as a catalytically active cofactor in microbial enzymes as a result znso4 showed promoting effect on the microbial activities during the chronic exposure in contrast nzno had negligible even negative effects on eea especially on day 10 when the activities of gap pod ppo nag and ars were significantly inhibited by nzno at all tested concentrations fig 3 p 0 05 comparing the different responses to nzno and znso4 we speculate that the inhibitions on eea are mostly attributed to the toxic effect of np instead of ionic zn at the environmental concentration pollution by metals is reported to decrease fungal diversity by eliminating sensitive species in freshwaters niyogi et al 2009 sridhar et al 2000 while chronic exposure regardless of nzno and znso4 at environmental concentration did not cause the loss of fungal diversity instead to increasing the fungal diversity in our work the outcome is in line with the observation of medeiros et al 2010 that metal pollution affect aquatic fungal diversity is depending on metal concentration as a result zn at such low concentration may act as an important selective agent driving the evolution of fungal communities hoostal et al 2008 after 45 day exposure nzno at 300 l 1 led to a distinct fungal community on leaves from other microcosms because of the clear changes in community composition fig 5 for example the genus anguillospora occurred in high frequency and became the greatest contributor to the fungal community after exposure of nzno 300 ng l 1 excluded and znso4 figs 5 6 medeiros et al 2010 and pascoal et al 2005 both found that anguillospora filiformis and anguillospora tetracladia were dominant on leaves decomposing in metal polluted conditions indicating the important role of these species in litter decomposition under metal pollution thus the dominance of anguillospora on leaves in our study suggests that some species of this genus could develop tolerance to nzno and znso4 and eventually lead to higher litter decomposition rate compared to the control in contrast the significant reduction of litter decomposition rate in the exposure scenarios at 300 ng l 1 nzno might be resulted from the decrease of anguillospora abundance fig 5 the effect of nzno and znso4 on litter decomposition rate is the comprehensive consequence of the responses of fungal biomass enzyme activity and community structure znso4 in our experiment led to significant increases in decomposition rate which was mostly attributed to the increases in enzyme activity and the tolerant fungal community for nzno the toxic cause might be more complicated because of its two components ionic zn and np the results suggest that nzno toxicity may be attributed to the combined effect of its two components which is not consistent with a previous notion that agnp induced strong effects independent of those mediated by ionic silver tlili et al 2017 in our study we assume that ionic zn and nps have promoting and inhibiting effect on litter decomposition respectively as a result nps alleviated the promoting effect of ionic zn on litter decomposition rate when the concentration was 30 ng l 1 additionally negative np effect became more considerable when nzno concentration was 300 ng l 1 that caused a 21 decrease of decomposition rate fig 1 p 0 05 although negative effects of chronic exposure on litter decomposition have been recently noted jain et al 2019 nzno concentrations in that study 25 μm were 6750 times higher than in our experiment additionally nzno at 300 ng l 1 significantly increased the litter c n ratio fig 2 p 0 05 which would negatively affect the nutrient cycling of the food chain thus the exposure scenarios at 300 ng l 1 nzno highlight a distinctly greater potential of nzno toxicity on freshwater ecosystems than previously expected 5 conclusions overall our study provides unique information that leaf litter decomposition could be impacted by environmental concentration of nzno despite nzno at 30 and 3000 ng l 1 did not achieve negative effect on litter decomposition rate they negatively affected the process parameters associate with litter decomposition such as fungal biomass and enzyme activity additional to the above two parameters fungal community structure was clearly impacted by nzno at 300 ng l 1 due to the reduced proportion of anguillospora which eventually caused a significant decrease in litter decomposition rate in conclusion the ecotoxicological effect of nzno on leaf litter decomposition is the comprehensive consequence based on responses of fungal biomass microbial enzyme activity as well as fungal community structure thus these findings underscore the importance of considering multifaceted nature of microbial sensitivity when assessing the potential

17912,ecotoxicological risk of zno nanoparticles at environmental levels is a key knowledge gap for predicting how freshwater ecosystems will respond to nanoparticle pollution a microcosm experiment was conducted to explore the chronic effects of zno nanoparticle at environmental concentrations 30 300 3000 ng l 1 on aquatic fungi associated with the decomposing process of poplar leaf litter 45 days zno nanoparticles led to 9 33 increases in fungal biomass after acute exposure 5 days but 33 50 decreases after chronic exposure 45 days indicating that the hormetic effect of zno nanoparticles at the environmental level may occur during acute exposure besides zno nanoparticles had negative effects on microbial enzyme activity especially on day 10 when the activities of n acetylglucosaminidase glycine aminopeptidase aryl sulfatase polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase were significantly inhibited after chronic exposure the fungal community structure was significantly impacted by zno nanoparticles at 300 ng l 1 due to the reduced proportion of anguillospora which eventually caused a significant decrease in litter decomposition rate therefore zno nanoparticles may pose ecotoxicological effects on aquatic fungi even at a very low concentration and eventually negatively affect freshwater functioning keywords environmental concentration zno nanoparticles fungal biomass enzyme activity fungal community structure 1 introduction leaf litter is an important nutrient input of streams and its decomposition is a key driver of carbon cycling which links riparian plants microorganisms and invertebrates baldy et al 2010 dighton 1997 the microbial decomposers especially aquatic fungi assume dominant roles in leaf litter decomposition kuehn et al 1999 as a functional community fungi can produce and secrete an array of extracellular enzymes that participate in leaf degradation kuehn 2016 suberkropp 1991 2001 the rate of litter decomposition can be affected by environmental stressors by altering community structures and activities of fungi webster and benfield 1986 therefore it is essential to understand the effect of contaminants on aquatic fungi to allow predicting ecosystem response to environmental stressors due to high specific surface and other unique physiochemical properties garcía gómez et al 2017 nanoparticles nps are incorporated in a variety of applications such as pigments textiles semiconductors and personal health care products kahru and dubourguier 2010 the growing production and use are expected to increase

functioning al mahrouqi et al 2018 engeman et al 2012 kiser et al 2009 windler et al 2012 leaf litter decomposition has been used as an evaluation model to assess the harmful effects of emerging pollutants on stream functioning including cuo nps pradhan et al 2011 ceo2 nps bour et al 2016 and ag nps tlili et al 2016 among the prevalent nanomaterials zinc oxide nanoparticles nzno are largely used in industrial products bondarenko et al 2013 and numerous studies have investigated the nzno toxicity on aquatic organisms such as algae bhuvaneshwari et al 2015 crustacean bacchetta et al 2017 and fish chupani et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 the toxic mechanisms are generally attributed to three aspects i release of ionic zn ii increase in oxidative stress and iii its physicochemical properties cupi et al 2015 ma et al 2013 besides our previous studies showed that the effects of nzno on leaf litter decomposition were depended on its particle size du et al 2017a and concentration du et al 2019 in natural water however these investigations are based on the experiments that were conducted on nzno concentrations from 1 to 1000 mg l 1 bai et al 2009 hao and chen 2012 khosravi katuli et al 2018 instead of taking into account the potential effects of nzno at environmental relevant level so such observation may have provided overestimated results on nzno impacts due to the much higher analyzed concentration than the estimated environment concentrations surface water 10 ng l 1 and treated wastewater 430 ng l 1 al mahrouqi et al 2018 gottschalk et al 2009 ma et al 2013 therefore the present study explored the potential effects of nzno at environmental concentrations 30 300 and 3000 ng l 1 on leaf litter decomposition to comprehensively evaluate the consequences of the realistic environmental exposure scenarios to capture effects of nzno at environmental levels on leaf litter decomposition mediated by aquatic fungi we chose fungal biomass nine enzymatic activities and community structure as integrative variables reflecting fungal activity and used litter decomposition rate and litter chemical components to comprehensively target the ecological consequence of litter decomposition driven by aquatic fungi information on the comparative effect across different environmental concentrations of nzno will help us to better understand the impacts of nzno on freshwater

to increases in these correlated enzyme activities except for 3000 ng l 1 znso4 on day 45 also it can be seen that nitrogen mining was promoted by nzno but inhibited by znso4 for pc2 exposure of nzno caused a decrease in lap on day 5 30 and 300 ng l 1 10 300 and 3000 ng l 1 and 45 300 and 3000 ng l 1 the reduction of lap was also observed in the microcosms with znso4 on day 5 30 3000 ng l 1 15 30 3000 ng l 1 30 30 3000 ng l 1 and 45 30 3000 ng l 1 the opposite effects were found on ars 3 5 aquatic fungal biomass fungal biomass showed various responses among the microcosms exposed to the tested concentrations of nzno and znso4 in the control microcosms fungal biomass gradually increased with litter decomposing time on day 5 nzno showed promoting effect on fungal biomass especially at 30 and 300 ng l 1 which led to 33 and 20 increase respectively fig 4 p 0 05 while znso4 caused 29 34 decrease in fungal biomass fig 4 p 0 05 on day 15 both nzno and znso4 at 30 ng l 1 increased fungal biomass by 56 and 160 respectively fig 4 p 0 05 the nzno at 3000 ng l 1 significantly inhibited fungal biomass in contrast znso4 at the same concentration led to a 62 increase in fungal biomass fig 4 p 0 05 on day 40 significant reductions of fungal biomass were detected in all microcosms with nzno and znso4 fig 4 p 0 05 3 6 aquatic fungal community from the 18s rdna sequencing more than 55 371 reads with 216 bp length were obtained from each sample the number of otus at 97 sequence identity ranged from 72 to 221 species richness indices indicated that the number of outs in the treatments increased compared with the control the diversity indices also showed that the fungal diversity is enhanced in the microcosms with nzno and znso4 for example nzno at 300 ng l 1 led to a 55 increase in the shannon index of the aquatic fungal community table 2 in initially samples the dominant fungal genus was assigned as unclassified fungi fig 5 after 45 day exposure substantial differences in the fungal community structures were detected from microcosms exposed to nzno and znso4 in the control microcosms anguillospora 37 33 unclassified fungi 20 86 tetracladium 16 98 and alternaria 13 64 were among the main genera detected fig 5 anguillospora 48 65 ciliophora 4 49 and unclassified helotiales 6 36 were present in increased proportions after exposure of nzno at 30 ng l 1 compared with the control whereas the position of tetracladium and alternaria was reduced to 10 97 and 0 03 respectively the increased proportion of unclassified fungi 51 33 pseudohalonectria 8 54 and unclassified norank helotiales 6 92 and the decreased abundance of tetracladium 11 90 alternaria 0 02 unclassified pleosporales 0 03 and unclassified helotiales 0 68 were detected in the microcosms with nzno at 300 ng l 1 in addition to anguillospora and unclassified fungi ciliophora and unclassified pleosporales became the dominant fungi after exposure to znso4 especially in the microcosms with znso4 at 300 ng l 1 the proportion of ciliophora and unclassified pleosporales increased to 31 53 and 4 53 respectively whereas the abundance of tetracladium and alternaria was reduced to 0 and 3 21 respectively compared to the control little differentiation among fungal communities exposed to different concentrations of nzno and znso4 was demonstrated by nmds fig 6 notably a distinct fungal community had developed in the microcosms with nzno at 300 l 1 lefse detected differentially abundant aquatic fungal taxa α 0 01 lda score 2 on various phylogenetic levels fig 7 unclassified leotiomycetes was overrepresented in the control microcosms while unclassified pleosporales and mycosphaerella tassiana became the key fungus after exposure of nzno at 30 and 300 ng l 1 respectively meanwhile pyrenochaetopsis leptospora and anguillospora longissima were enriched in the microcosms with nzno at 3000 ng l 1 4 discussion most ecotoxicological assessments of nzno effects on freshwater functioning to date focus on high concentration treatments du et al 2017a 2019 which may not readily be extended to the more likely scenario of low concentration exposures effects of nzno at environmental levels on leaf litter decomposition mediated by aquatic fungi were evaluated in the present study and our results provide compelling evidence that aquatic fungi are sensitive to nzno exposure even at very low concentrations with complicated consequences for biogeochemical process in freshwater ecosystems one important insight from our experiment is that acute 5 days and chronic 45 days exposure of nzno had opposite effects on fungal biomass the stimulatory effect of toxic chemicals at low concentration on organismal metabolism is referred to as a hormetic effect calabrese 2008 the increase in fungal biomass might be attributed to the hormetic effect of nzno on aquatic fungi similar effect of nzno has been shown for various organisms such as raphanus sativus brassica rapus tetrahymena thermophile and eisenia fetida in previous studies bondarenko et al 2013 li et al 2011 lin and xing 2007 but our study firstly demonstrate that nzno at very low concentrations may have hermetic effects on aquatic fungi and chronic exposure will alleviate this promotion even shift it to damaging effect another notable consequence is that aquatic fungi were more sensitive to znso4 than to nzno after acute exposure 5 days which was reflected in the significant decreases of fungal biomass fig 4 p 0 05 this outcome might be due to the higher initial concentration of ionic zn table 1 which achieved to the toxic level to aquatic fungi in contrast the process of nzno dissolution led to much lower concentrations of ionic zn before 3 days which reduced the initially toxic potential of nzno despite its damaging effect on fungal biomass znso4 led to clearly promoting effects on activities of most microbial enzymes fig 3 fig s2 although previous studies have demonstrated decreases in microbial enzymatic activity due to zn pollution the zn concentrations used in those studies were one or two orders of magnitude higher than in our experiment zn is an important component of enzymes for protein synthesis and energy production hansch and mendel 2009 additionally some extracellular hydrolytic activities are dependent on zn such as nucleases aminopeptidases peptide deformylases serero et al 2001 α mannosidase snaith and levvy 1968 and metalloproteinases maidment et al 1999 we speculate that zn at such low concentration in our study might act as a catalytically active cofactor in microbial enzymes as a result znso4 showed promoting effect on the microbial activities during the chronic exposure in contrast nzno had negligible even negative effects on eea especially on day 10 when the activities of gap pod ppo nag and ars were significantly inhibited by nzno at all tested concentrations fig 3 p 0 05 comparing the different responses to nzno and znso4 we speculate that the inhibitions on eea are mostly attributed to the toxic effect of np instead of ionic zn at the environmental concentration pollution by metals is reported to decrease fungal diversity by eliminating sensitive species in freshwaters niyogi et al 2009 sridhar et al 2000 while chronic exposure regardless of nzno and znso4 at environmental concentration did not cause the loss of fungal diversity instead to increasing the fungal diversity in our work the outcome is in line with the observation of medeiros et al 2010 that metal pollution affect aquatic fungal diversity is depending on metal concentration as a result zn at such low concentration may act as an important selective agent driving the evolution of fungal communities hoostal et al 2008 after 45 day exposure nzno at 300 l 1 led to a distinct fungal community on leaves from other microcosms because of the clear changes in community composition fig 5 for example the genus anguillospora occurred in high frequency and became the greatest contributor to the fungal community after exposure of nzno 300 ng l 1 excluded and znso4 figs 5 6 medeiros et al 2010 and pascoal et al 2005 both found that anguillospora filiformis and anguillospora tetracladia were dominant on leaves decomposing in metal polluted conditions indicating the important role of these species in litter decomposition under metal pollution thus the dominance of anguillospora on leaves in our study suggests that some species of this genus could develop tolerance to nzno and znso4 and eventually lead to higher litter decomposition rate compared to the control in contrast the significant reduction of litter decomposition rate in the exposure scenarios at 300 ng l 1 nzno might be resulted from the decrease of anguillospora abundance fig 5 the effect of nzno and znso4 on litter decomposition rate is the comprehensive consequence of the responses of fungal biomass enzyme activity and community structure znso4 in our experiment led to significant increases in decomposition rate which was mostly attributed to the increases in enzyme activity and the tolerant fungal community for nzno the toxic cause might be more complicated because of its two components ionic zn and np the results suggest that nzno toxicity may be attributed to the combined effect of its two components which is not consistent with a previous notion that agnp induced strong effects independent of those mediated by ionic silver tlili et al 2017 in our study we assume that ionic zn and nps have promoting and inhibiting effect on litter decomposition respectively as a result nps alleviated the promoting effect of ionic zn on litter decomposition rate when the concentration was 30 ng l 1 additionally negative np effect became more considerable when nzno concentration was 300 ng l 1 that caused a 21 decrease of decomposition rate fig 1 p 0 05 although negative effects of chronic exposure on litter decomposition have been recently noted jain et al 2019 nzno concentrations in that study 25 μm were 6750 times higher than in our experiment additionally nzno at 300 ng l 1 significantly increased the litter c n ratio fig 2 p 0 05 which would negatively affect the nutrient cycling of the food chain thus the exposure scenarios at 300 ng l 1 nzno highlight a distinctly greater potential of nzno toxicity on freshwater ecosystems than previously expected 5 conclusions overall our study provides unique information that leaf litter decomposition could be impacted by environmental concentration of nzno despite nzno at 30 and 3000 ng l 1 did not achieve negative effect on litter decomposition rate they negatively affected the process parameters associate with litter decomposition such as fungal biomass and enzyme activity additional to the above two parameters fungal community structure was clearly impacted by nzno at 300 ng l 1 due to the reduced proportion of anguillospora which eventually caused a significant decrease in litter decomposition rate in conclusion the ecotoxicological effect of nzno on leaf litter decomposition is the comprehensive consequence based on responses of fungal biomass microbial enzyme activity as well as fungal community structure thus these findings underscore the importance of considering multifaceted nature of microbial sensitivity when assessing the potential

17913,karst aquifers are important drinking water resources but highly vulnerable to contamination contaminants can be transported rapidly through a network of fractures and conduits with only limited sorption or degradation which usually leads to a fast and strong response at karst springs during migration contaminants can also enter less mobile zones such as pools or water in intra karstic sediments or advance from conduits into the adjacent fractured rock matrix as contaminant concentrations in the main flow path s decrease contaminants may migrate back into the main flow path and reach the karst springs at low but significant concentrations over a long time span this is the conventional interpretation for the oft observed steep rising limb and the long tailed falling limb of tracer breakthrough curves in karst systems here field measurements are examined from an alpine karst system in austria where a series of distinctive long tailed breakthrough curves btcs of conservative tracers were observed over distances up to 7400 m recognizing that the conventional advection dispersion equation ade cannot usually quantify such behavior two other modeling approaches are considered namely the two region non equilibrium 2rne model which explicitly includes mobile and immobile zones and a continuous time random walk ctrw model which is based on a physically based probabilistic approach that describes anomalous or non fickian transport behavior characteristic of heterogeneous systems such as karst in most cases the ade and 2rne models do not quantify the low concentrations at longer travel times the ctrw in contrast accounts for the long tailed breakthrough behavior found in this karst system graphical abstract image 1 keywords continuous time random walk ctrw non fickian transport field test site heterogeneity karst aquifer 1 introduction contaminants of emerging concern cecs also known as emerging contaminants are now recognized due largely to development of sensitive analytical capabilities as being virtually omnipresent in many surface water and groundwater resources bradley et al 2018 furlong et al 2017 glassmeyer et al 2017 masoner et al 2019 pal et al 2010 tiedeken et al 2017 albeit at low concentrations in the ng l to low µg l range cecs can cause adverse effects to human health and pose risks to ecosystems that are difficult to predict pal et al 2010 tiedeken et al 2017 many cecs are not removed during water treatment and are persistent in soil water aquifer environments glassmeyer et al 2017 atrazine as an example has been prohibited for use in germany since 1992 yet it is still detected in karst spring water in southern germany in the low ng l range hillebrand et al 2014 this pattern is explained by a slow but steady release from the host karst aquifer matrix to conduits and ultimately to springs karst aquifers are important freshwater resources about 22 of the european continent and about 15 of the global ice free land surface are composed of carbonate rocks chen et al 2017a 2017b goldscheider et al 2020 many large cities are supplied predominantly by freshwater from karst aquifers such as vienna austria rome italy and san antonio usa hartmann et al 2014 a critical concern is that karst aquifers are exceptionally vulnerable to contamination due to potentially immediate and direct underground drainage via swallow holes and fast transport via conduits to karst springs ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 groundwater tracing tests with conservative artificial tracers are used frequently to study subsurface transport characteristics in karst areas goldscheider et al 2008 käss 2004 an oft observed phenomenon is long tailed breakthrough curves btcs which characterize low tracer concentrations at long travel times critically these late time relatively low concentrations in the case of contaminants can still be sufficiently high to significantly affect water quality over extended periods such long tailed btcs cannot be described by the classical advection dispersion equation ade barbera et al 2018 doummar et al 2018 geyer et al 2007 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 goldscheider 2008 hillebrand et al 2012 tranter et al 2017 in most cases the long tailing is attributed to the influence of subsurface ponds or other immobile regions along the flow path and or exchange with the adjacent fractured rock matrix two region non equilibrium 2rne models have been applied to interpret such experimental data but these models too still generally fail to quantify the lowest concentrations at late travel times barbera et al 2018 geyer et al 2007 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 more recently continuous time random walk ctrw formulations have been developed to quantify ubiquitous non fickian or anomalous transport behavior which is characterized by early and late arrival times of tracers distinctly different from those expected by fickian ade like transport the ctrw framework which can include the ade 2rne and various multirate and time fractional models as special or limit cases has been demonstrated to enable interpretation of btcs over a broad range of heterogeneous porous and fractured geological media berkowitz et al 2006 2016 cortis et al 2005 over diverse length and time scales clearly tracer test sampling strategy at field sites can have an enormous impact on model results and interpretation as the longest travel times are generally neglected to reduce sampling effort as a consequence two major drawbacks hinder the correct interpretation of field tracer tests either samples at late travel times are neglected and undocumented and or long time samples with measured low concentrations exist but they are under represented when plotting and analyzing them on a linear scale this study interprets entire breakthrough curves from an alpine karst field site including the significant low concentrations at late travel times principally in terms of application of a ctrw approach for comparison we examine the ade and 2rne models as they have been applied in a considerable number of recent studies that analyze btc measurements from karst aquifers e g doummar et al 2018 barbera et al 2018 ender et al 2018 geyer et al 2007 data from field tracer tests at the kilometer scale in the hochifen gottesacker austria area are shown goldscheider 2005 which have not been modeled previously as well as newly presented data the main objectives are to i identify a modeling framework that can quantify the entire evolution of a btc including the critical long time tails that contribute low but significant concentrations of chemicals over extended periods ii improve the general understanding of transport characteristics in karst aquifers and iii evaluate variability and scale dependencies of model transport parameters by examining different sampling locations along the flow paths to the authors knowledge this is the first application of the ctrw approach to kilometer scale field data and at the same time the first application to a karst aquifer 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the karst test site is located in the northern alps at the border between germany bavaria and austria vorarlberg it belongs to the helvetic zone which plunges on three sides underneath the flysch nappes consisting of marl and sandstone formations wyssling 1986 the most important helvetic rock formation is the cretaceous 75 125 m thick schrattenkalk limestone layer which forms the surface of the gottesacker terrain goldscheider 2005 and acts as main aquifer at the contact between the karst aquifer the schrattenkalk limestone and the impermeable layers the overlying marl and flysch deposits the schwarzwasser valley formed fig 1 previous research goldscheider 2005 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 has shown that the orientation of the underground flow paths is structurally controlled in total 19 tracer tests were carried out covering the test site from the schwarzwasser valley to the top of the gottesacker terrain and the expected water divide with the neighboring valley the major outcomes are as follows at the top parts of the gottesacker terrain the aquifer base is above the local hydrological base and the underground flow paths follow the dip of the strata toward the axis of the synclines the syncline axes themselves plunge toward the southeast under the schwarzwasser valley they act as the main drainage axes whereas anticlines are local water divides along the entire schwarzwasser valley there is a continuous karst aquifer below the valley axis fig 1b that collects groundwater from the more elevated areas of the gottesacker terrain and also receives inflow from the bordering flysch area the karst aquifer system is essentially drained by three major outlets an estavelle e in fig 1 i e a cave that acts as swallow hole during low flow conditions and transforms into a spring during high flow conditions a temporal karst spring aubach spring au a perennial karst spring saegebach spring sb and two smaller springs that are not considered here at the injection points ip i ip gb and ip e tracer is injected into actively sinking surface waters these injection sites are located along the valley axis the longest flow path between injection and sampling location is 7400 m between ip i and sb ip ga is located close to the syncline running from north of mount hochifen to the schwarzwasser valley where it joins the valley parallel flow path the flow path length to sb is about 6375 m during the field tracer tests either the fluorescent dye uranine cas rn 518 47 8 or eosin cas rn 17372 87 1 was used as a conservative tracer goldscheider 2005 water samples of 50 ml were taken at the springs for laboratory analysis of uranine and eosin which were analyzed with perkinelmer ls 50b and ls 55 spectrofluorometers for analysis the samples were adjusted with 50 μl of ph 10 buffer for uranine and ph 4 6 buffer for eosin respectively to achieve the maximum fluorescence intensity following the standard procedure reported in käss 2004 detection limits are exceptionally low for uranine 0 005 μg l and eosin 0 05 μg l volumetric fluid discharge q at each spring was determined by salt dilution method leibundgut et al 2009 the tracer concentrations are shown as normalized concentrations c q m recov where m recov is the recovered tracer mass shapiro et al 2008 this allows a direct comparison of i different sampling locations with different discharges and recovered masses as well as ii different tests discharges and recovered masses at one sampling location 2 2 data analysis mean flow conditions during the experiments are chosen to model the tracer btcs the analysis conceptualizes the flow and transport domain as an effective essentially one dimensional scenario for tracer transport this is applied in the comparisons of the ctrw 2rne and ade models below the simplification of applying a one dimensional model can be justified as bulk flow through karst conduits can be ascribed as one dimensional chen et al 2017 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 the recovery rates r are calculated using the flow rate q determined at the spring outlets 1 r 1 m t 0 q c d t where m is the injected tracer mass and c is the aqueous concentration at time t leibundgut et al 2009 in each of the three model analyses ctrw 2rne ade measures of error between model solutions and data are quantified in terms of the coefficient of determination r2 and the mean absolute percentage error mape 2 3 continuous time random walk ctrw model the btcs presented here are principally evaluated using the ctrw approach berkowitz et al 2006 2016 cortis et al 2005 detailed expositions of the theory development and implementation of ctrw models are given in e g berkowitz et al 2006 2016 a brief review of the main aspects is presented here for convenience the ctrw framework accounts for fluctuations in the flow field and in concentrations of migrating chemicals tracers in terms of probability distributions which lead to non fickian or anomalous transport behavior as a consequence the ctrw can effectively describe chemical transport and reactions where relevant over a range of length and time scales chemical transport is conceptualized by using particles to represent dissolved chemical species these particles migrate as a random walk through the domain by following spatiotemporal transitions spatial displacements governed by structural heterogeneity together with the time taken for each of these displacements a key feature of the ctrw approach is that the full probability distribution of particle transition times is considered via a probability density function ψ s t that couples the spatial displacement s and time t of each particle transition in general it is sufficient and convenient to decouple the function in the form ψ s t p s ψ t with ψ t the probability rate for a transition time t between sites and p s the probability distribution of the transition lengths dentz et al 2008 the governing ctrw transport equation based on a generalized master equation can be written as an integro partial differential equation in a continuum ensemble averaged system as 2 c s t t 0 t d t m t t v ψ c s t d ψ c s t where c s t is the normalized concentration m is a memory function and the dyadic symbol denotes a tensor product the characteristic transport particle velocity v ψ and d ψ the generalized dispersion are defined in terms of the first and second moments of p s equation 2 can be written in laplace space as 3 u c s u c o s m u v ψ c s u d ψ c s u where the laplace transform of the memory function is m u t u ψ u 1 ψ u with t a characteristic time denoting laplace space and u denoting the laplace variable it is emphasized that in this formulation and as distinct from the classical ade and related models such as the 2rne model discussed below v ψ is not identical to the mean fluid velocity and d ψ is not a simple spread around a mean fluid velocity in fact the mean particle and fluid velocities in heterogeneous porous and fractured domains are rarely the same because of structural hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity the identifiable interrogation or sampling of the domain by water and chemical tracers is actually distinct to explain while both chemical tracers and water molecules undergo in addition to advection diffusive and dispersive transport mechanisms the water molecules are not tagged identifiable as such diffusive and dispersive effects on bulk movement of water are not generally observable in contrast to clearly identifiable chemical tracers as a consequence the effective overall transport of a chemical tracer may be notably faster or in other cases slower than the average fluid velocity the choice of ψ t determines the definition of the memory function and is thus a foundation of the ctrw development a convenient and effective form of ψ t is that of a truncated power law discussed in detail in e g berkowitz et al 2006 2016 this form accounts for the possible evolution from non fickian to fickian behavior at relatively long travel times 4 ψ t n t 1 exp t t 2 1 t t 1 1 β 0 β 2 with n being a normalization constant defined as 5 n t 1 t 2 β exp t 1 t 2 γ β t 1 t 2 and where γ β t 1 t 2 denotes the incomplete gamma function the power law exponent β characterizes the degree of domain heterogeneity and of non fickian transport transport is fickian for β 2 this form of ψ t behaves as a power law leading to non fickian transport proportional to t t 1 1 β for particle transition times in the range t 1 t t 2 for transition times t t 2 ψ t decreases exponentially leading to fickian transport significantly when ψ t is exponential m u 1 and the ctrw transport equation 2 or 3 simplifies exactly to the ade as shown in 6 below e g berkowitz et al 2006 similarly mobile immobile and multirate models such as the 2rne model for example can also be derived as specialized cases of ctrw with appropriate choice of ψ t in 4 and 5 the characteristic time appearing in the memory function is chosen as t 1 which represents the onset of the power law region for the tracer tests reported here the ctrw model uses a robin type boundary condition at the inlet and a neuman type boundary condition at the outlet on the basis of extensive numerical simulations laboratory experiments and field measurements the ctrw framework has been demonstrated to successfully quantify subsurface chemical transport berkowitz et al 2006 2016 from pore to local field scales in the discussion below to distinguish the ctrw model parameters from the other two models 2rne ade the one dimensional variables v ψ and d ψ as well as β are hereafter denoted v ctrw d ctrw and β ctrw the ctrw model solutions were implemented using the freely downloadable software package reported in cortis et al 2005 2 4 advection dispersion equation ade and two region non equilibrium 2rne models for comparison and as a benchmark the btcs are also evaluated by a one dimensional ade 6 c t d 2 c x 2 v m c x with the mean fluid velocity v m and dispersion d acting as fitting parameters advection can be expressed as mean transit time t 0 or mean fluid velocity v m l t 0 with l flow path length the longitudinal dispersion d can be expressed in terms of the longitudinal dispersivity α d v m note that here diffusion is assumed negligible in the discrete karst conduits normalized concentrations c q m recov were used for all three models for the ade and 2rne models the normalized mass a which corresponds to the integral of the btc was used as an additional fitting parameter during the estimation procedure for an ideal fit r2 1 the normalized mass yields the value a 1 as shown below and as known already from the literature barbera et al 2018 geyer et al 2007 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 btcs with late time tails cannot be reproduced by the ade therefore the two region non equilibrium 2rne model is considered here the 2rne is based on the ade and describes the solute exchange between mobile and immobile fluid regions as a first order mass transfer process using two coupled equations toride et al 1999 for convenience the dimensionless form is given here modified after field and pinsky 2000 toride et al 1999 7 β 2 r n e c 1 t 1 p e 2 c 1 z 2 c 1 z ω c 1 c 2 8 1 β 2 r n e c 2 t ω c 1 c 2 where c represents the dimensionless solute concentration and t and z are dimensionless time and space variables respectively the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the mobile and immobile fluid regions respectively the dimensionless partitioning coefficient β 2rne 0 β 2rne 1 indicates the proportion of mobile water while the mass transfer coefficient ω 0 describes the exchange rate between the fluid regions the ade and 2rne model solutions were implemented using the software cxtfit toride et al 1999 for the ade and 2rne a dirac delta input function was used toride et al 1999 in low permeability media such as fractured rock tracer diffusion into the host porous matrix can be an important physical mechanism that affects the btcs bodin et al 2003 käss 2004 leibundgut et al 2009 zhou et al 2007 for long travel times compared to the peak travel time matrix diffusion causes a t 3 2 dependency of the concentration hadermann and heer 1996 tsang 1995 this is easily visible on a log log plot of concentration versus time where the tails of the btcs have a slope of 3 2 bodin et al 2003 in this context we examined the long time slopes of the btcs presented here 3 results and discussion 3 1 general characterization of the btcs at the karst springs measurements of the conservative tracers provide solid evidence of the underground connections between the injection points and the sampling locations aubach and saegebach springs which are located at flow path lengths ranging from 1000 m between ip e and aubach spring to 7400 m between ip i and saegebach spring fig 1 as the underground flow follows geological structures essentially synclines and the axis of the main valley and is comparatively well known from tracer tests geology and observations in caves goldscheider 2005 the distances between injection sites and springs are not given as linear distances but as distances along the generalized flow paths i e flow path lengths as shown in fig 1b which is more realistic than linear distance the actual flow path lengths in the underground are unknown but could be estimated by multiplying the generalized flow path lengths with tortuosity which is typically around 1 4 but can range between 1 1 and 3 9 in karst aquifers assari and mohammadi 2017 all injection sites with test numbers and sampling sites along with the individual distances are shown in the schematic sketch fig 1d all measured btcs show significant and long later time tailing with a steep early time rising limb representative btcs are shown in fig 2 the total recoveries of the injections range for aubach and saegebach springs from 10 9 to 81 8 table 2 depending on flow conditions and injection site in this highly developed karst conduit system there is no apparent dependency of the recovery rate on the tracer substance used the remaining quantities were partly recovered at the estavelle when it acted as spring during high flow conditions and at two smaller springs between au and sb that were not included in the analyses for this paper additionally infiltration into deeper parts of the aquifer can be assumed goldscheider 2005 generally though these values for recovery are in the range of what can be expected for karst aquifers goldscheider and drew 2007 for ip e results are available for different mean flow conditions in the range q au 133 300 l s data from the tests 1 2 3 and 5 appear in goldscheider 2005 while data from test 4 are new none of these data have been modeled previously thus the field tracer tests allow study in the context of the ctrw model as well as the 2rne and ade models of tracer transport parameters for the flow path along the entire schwarzwasser valley ip i ip gb ip e tracer transport parameters for the flow path following the syncline axis from the top of gottesacker and in the schwarzwasser valley ip ga the influence of hydrological conditions on tracer transport parameters via multiple injections into ip e the measured btcs were analyzed and interpreted using the ctrw 2rne and ade models representative fits to the btcs are shown in fig 2 and summaries of all fitted transport parameter values in the models are shown in table 1 ctrw model and table 2 ade and 2rne models referring first to the ctrw model it is evident from fig 2 that the full evolution of the btcs but particularly the distinctively long late time tailing is captured by the ctrw in contrast to the ctrw approach the ade and 2rne model solutions shown in fig 2 clearly do not capture this tailing although the 2rne shows somewhat longer tailing than the ade it should be emphasized that the late time concentrations while relatively low concentrations should not be ignored contaminants at low μg l to ng l levels are sufficient to significantly impact water quality over extended periods the long time tails of the btcs fig 2 are in the ng l range well above the detection limit of the fluorescent tracers the transport parameter values for all btc fits are shown in table 1 ctrw model and table 2 ade and 2rne models the poor fits of the ade solution explain the somewhat lower values for the coefficient of determination r2 of the ade ranging from 0 861 to 0 979 table 2 as compared to those of the 2rne and ctrw the values for the normalized mass a table 2 support this finding generally the values for the ade 0 67 0 89 are lower than for the 2rne 0 84 1 00 there are insignificant differences between the r2 values for the 2rne and ctrw however as the late time arrivals that involve low concentrations are of critical interest their error vanishes relative to that of the larger peak and earlier time concentrations as a consequence the mean absolute percentage error mape may be considered a better measure of the quality of model solution fits as seen in tables 1 and 2 the mape values for the ctrw model solution are in most cases significantly lower than those for the ade and 2rne solutions the poor matches of the 2rne and ade model solutions to the measurements may be ascribed to limiting assumptions in their basic formulation particularly that dispersive transport is fickian the conditions for the validity of this assumption and such models are discussed at length for example in berkowitz et al 2006 note too for example that the values of the mass transfer coefficient ω in the 2rne model which quantifies the exchange rate between two distinct mobile and immobile fluid regions do not display any uniformity or consistent trend in light of the results shown here the next section therefore focuses in more detail on the ctrw model and interpretation finally the role of matrix diffusion in these tracer tests was examined as noted at the end of section 2 4 the fingerprint for significant matrix diffusion is a long time btc slope of 3 2 on a log log plot of concentration versus time analysis of the long time slopes of the btcs for the aubach and saegebach springs and the injection points i gb e and ga indicates values between 1 94 and 4 95 which suggests that matrix diffusion can be neglected 3 2 impact of hydrological conditions distance and aquifer heterogeneity on solute transport the key parameter characterizing anomalous dispersive transport in the ctrw model β ctrw ranges from 1 19 to 1 36 for the three injection points along the schwarzwasser valley ip i gb and e and aubach spring and from 1 12 to 1 29 for the same injection points and saegebach spring table 1 the differences in the ranges of β ctrw for the aubach and saegebach springs are only minor standard deviations of 0 12 and 0 11 respectively this relatively narrow range of β ctrw values which quantifies the power law of the transition time distribution eq 4 over various pairs of injection and measurement points and a range of spring discharge rates q and with separation distances of up to several kilometers demonstrates a robust characterization in the ctrw framework quantifying anomalous transport recall fig 1d this result is also in accord with that of berkowitz and scher 2009 who analyzed btcs measured in heterogeneous sandpacks laboratory flow cells up to 2 1 m in length over a range of flow rates and demonstrated ctrw quantification with constant β ctrw values for the flow path along the syncline followed by the schwarzwasser valley ip ga the values of β ctrw are slightly larger with β ctrw 1 54 for aubach spring and β ctrw 1 58 for saegebach spring but strikingly similar the flow along the syncline axis in the upper part of the flow path might yield these higher values moreover the range of β ctrw values well below 2 confirms that the transport behavior is non fickian anomalous the overall strong heterogeneity of the karst aquifer hochifen gottesacker expressed by the β ctrw 2 appears highly justified for a well developed karst aquifer the general conceptual hydrogeological model of the aquifer comprises distinct conduits but also epikarst storage and rapid and slow flow reservoirs which represent the fractured rock matrix chen et al 2017 chen and goldscheider 2014 the different hydrological conditions are clear from the discharge recorded at the two karst springs table 1 for aubach spring the discharge ranges from 133 l s to 300 l s and saegebach spring from 203 l s to 370 l s during the tracer experiments saegebach spring receives additional groundwater inflow from the adjacent mahdtal valley and the hoelloch cave system goeppert and goldscheider 2008 goldscheider 2005 with the above in mind other transport parameters for the ctrw models can be examined to gain further insight into the impact of hydrological conditions distance and aquifer heterogeneity on solute transport properties first referring to the discussion following eq 4 it is seen from table 1 that the values of t 2 the cutoff time in eq 4 for the onset of fickian transport are as much as two orders of magnitude larger than the duration of the measurements these values range over various measurement distances and discharge rates which further confirms that the overall transport behavior in the karst aquifer is non fickian the values of t 1 the characteristic time for a tracer transition for the onset of the power law behavior in eq 4 are of the order of 0 1 1 min this range is reasonable in the context of average fluid velocities of 1 2 m min 50 100 m h table 2 determined from fitting the ade and 2rne model solutions to essentially the peak concentrations of the measured btcs the ctrw tracer transport velocities not fluid velocities recall the discussion in section 2 3 following eq 3 are in the range 108 401 m h and the generalized dispersion coefficients are in the range 351 6810 m2 h to place in perspective the ranges of fluid velocities and dispersion coefficients determined from fitting the ade and 2rne model solutions table 2 are in the range of what can be expected for karst aquifers goldscheider and drew 2007 as seen in table 1 the ctrw model tracer transport velocities v ctrw are larger than the fluid velocities estimated using the ade and 2rne models in accord with the discussion in section 2 3 and previous studies e g berkowitz et al 2006 note though that if the tracer transport velocity is nevertheless equated to the fluid velocity the range of values found here remains in the range of what can be expected in such karst aquifers goldscheider and drew 2007 finally it is of interest to examine correlations of the ctrw model parameter estimates of β ctrw v ctrw and d ctrw relative to the distance d between injection and sampling points as well as to estimates from other literature fig 3 presents plots showing how i d ctrw increases with v ctrw ii a generalized ctrw dispersivity d ctrw v ctrw increases with d and β ctrw remains relatively constant with d in comparison to selected laboratory tests with porous media edery et al 2015 kuntz et al 2011 these patterns becomes even clearer the analysis of kuntz et al 2011 includes a field doublet tracer test in a fractured weathered shale bedrock over a distance of 4 5 m to the authors knowledge there are no other available experimental field studies dealing with tracer transport and ctrw modeling for comparison especially at the kilometer scale the analysis of berkowitz et al 2008 used a modified two scale ctrw model to interpret a uranine tracer test in a single high porosity shear zone but the injection and extraction wells were separated by only 2 5 m from fig 3 a natural scale effect is observed between d ctrw and v ctrw fig 3a and between the generalized ctrw dispersivity d ctrw v ctrw and d most significantly though is that β ctrw the measure of heterogeneity and degree of anomalous transport essentially does not vary with scale the overall influence of the hydrological conditions on the transport properties of karst aquifers especially fluid velocity and dispersion as defined in terms of the ade is discussed in the literature barbera et al 2018 doummar et al 2018 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 käss 2004 and references therein morales et al 2007 typically the fluid velocity increases as the discharge increases and dispersion increases with distance analogous behavior is seen in the transport parameters obtained here by the ctrw model recent literature doubts the scaling of macrodispersivity in terms of the ade and fickian transport from field data and questions existence of a unique scaling law zech et al 2015 2019 which would facilitate easier prediction of groundwater flow by practitioners however zech at al 2015 focus on unconsolidated aquifers of low to medium heterogeneity and incorporate only tests with distances less than 3500 m their analysis also focuses entirely on parameters and parameter values obtained by assuming that transport is fickian and fully quantified by the ade model the present study deals with distances that are larger emphasizes karst aquifers and is predicated on a ctrw model that accounts intrinsically for non fickian transport and the measured long tailing while a unique scaling law cannot currently be drawn from the limited number of individual tests shown in fig 3 there does appear to be a general trend 3 3 environmental relevancy to delineate groundwater protection zones and in particular to delineate the inner protection zone zone ii a certain travel time is applied in germany the 50 day travel time from any point below the water table to the source is used while austria and denmark employ a 60 day travel time schmoll et al 2006 and switzerland adopted a 10 days travel time tracer tests are a highly recommended tool to acquire the required information to calculate the relevant parameters flow velocities for groundwater protection zoning schmoll et al 2006 therefore an appropriate method for modeling the transport parameters is needed given the great importance and potential risk of low concentrations of contaminants in the subsurface an improved understanding of the transport parameters and an approach considering subsurface heterogeneity is required which can interpreted using the ctrw framework future tasks could include implementation of a ctrw formulation into numerical groundwater modeling frameworks 4 conclusions and implications the ctrw framework widely adopted for laboratory investigations of porous media and numerical simulations of chemical transport effectively quantifies transport in the gottesacker hochifen karst aquifer the key parameter characterizing the degree of domain heterogeneity and anomalous transport β ctrw indicates non fickian anomalous transport and does not vary with flow distance the β ctrw parameter accounts for the heterogeneity of the karst aquifer which comprises an epikarst zone fractured rock matrix and conduits where this degree of heterogeneity is justified the investigation scale and fluid velocity influences the ctrw transport parameters for tracer velocity and dispersion a clear relationship is exhibited at this scale and may indicate a unique scaling law that might be advantageous to practitioners thus field tests appear to need a certain investigation scale to be significant to investigate low concentrations at late travel times in heterogeneous aquifers such as karst aquifers ctrw might be an important modeling tool that is able to simulate conservative solutes such as uranine the analysis here a first application of the ctrw approach to kilometer scale field data and first application to a karst aquifer can be extended to other reactive tracers and contaminants if these compounds are of interest application of the ctrw framework holds the potential for application to tracer test analyses from other field sites in porous or fractured aquifers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17913,karst aquifers are important drinking water resources but highly vulnerable to contamination contaminants can be transported rapidly through a network of fractures and conduits with only limited sorption or degradation which usually leads to a fast and strong response at karst springs during migration contaminants can also enter less mobile zones such as pools or water in intra karstic sediments or advance from conduits into the adjacent fractured rock matrix as contaminant concentrations in the main flow path s decrease contaminants may migrate back into the main flow path and reach the karst springs at low but significant concentrations over a long time span this is the conventional interpretation for the oft observed steep rising limb and the long tailed falling limb of tracer breakthrough curves in karst systems here field measurements are examined from an alpine karst system in austria where a series of distinctive long tailed breakthrough curves btcs of conservative tracers were observed over distances up to 7400 m recognizing that the conventional advection dispersion equation ade cannot usually quantify such behavior two other modeling approaches are considered namely the two region non equilibrium 2rne model which explicitly includes mobile and immobile zones and a continuous time random walk ctrw model which is based on a physically based probabilistic approach that describes anomalous or non fickian transport behavior characteristic of heterogeneous systems such as karst in most cases the ade and 2rne models do not quantify the low concentrations at longer travel times the ctrw in contrast accounts for the long tailed breakthrough behavior found in this karst system graphical abstract image 1 keywords continuous time random walk ctrw non fickian transport field test site heterogeneity karst aquifer 1 introduction contaminants of emerging concern cecs also known as emerging contaminants are now recognized due largely to development of sensitive analytical capabilities as being virtually omnipresent in many surface water and groundwater resources bradley et al 2018 furlong et al 2017 glassmeyer et al 2017 masoner et al 2019 pal et al 2010 tiedeken et al 2017 albeit at low concentrations in the ng l to low µg l range cecs can cause adverse effects to human health and pose risks to ecosystems that are difficult to predict pal et al 2010 tiedeken et al 2017 many cecs are not removed during water treatment and are persistent in soil water aquifer environments glassmeyer et al 2017 atrazine as an example has been prohibited for use in germany since 1992 yet it is still detected in karst spring water in southern germany in the low ng l range hillebrand et al 2014 this pattern is explained by a slow but steady release from the host karst aquifer matrix to conduits and ultimately to springs karst aquifers are important freshwater resources about 22 of the european continent and about 15 of the global ice free land surface are composed of carbonate rocks chen et al 2017a 2017b goldscheider et al 2020 many large cities are supplied predominantly by freshwater from karst aquifers such as vienna austria rome italy and san antonio usa hartmann et al 2014 a critical concern is that karst aquifers are exceptionally vulnerable to contamination due to potentially immediate and direct underground drainage via swallow holes and fast transport via conduits to karst springs ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 groundwater tracing tests with conservative artificial tracers are used frequently to study subsurface transport characteristics in karst areas goldscheider et al 2008 käss 2004 an oft observed phenomenon is long tailed breakthrough curves btcs which characterize low tracer concentrations at long travel times critically these late time relatively low concentrations in the case of contaminants can still be sufficiently high to significantly affect water quality over extended periods such long tailed btcs cannot be described by the classical advection dispersion equation ade barbera et al 2018 doummar et al 2018 geyer et al 2007 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 goldscheider 2008 hillebrand et al 2012 tranter et al 2017 in most cases the long tailing is attributed to the influence of subsurface ponds or other immobile regions along the flow path and or exchange with the adjacent fractured rock matrix two region non equilibrium 2rne models have been applied to interpret such experimental data but these models too still generally fail to quantify the lowest concentrations at late travel times barbera et al 2018 geyer et al 2007 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 more recently continuous time random walk ctrw formulations have been developed to quantify ubiquitous non fickian or anomalous transport behavior which is characterized by early and late arrival times of tracers distinctly different from those expected by fickian ade like transport the ctrw framework which can include the ade 2rne and various multirate and time fractional models as special or limit cases has been demonstrated to enable interpretation of btcs over a broad range of heterogeneous porous and fractured geological media berkowitz et al 2006 2016 cortis et al 2005 over diverse length and time scales clearly tracer test sampling strategy at field sites can have an enormous impact on model results and interpretation as the longest travel times are generally neglected to reduce sampling effort as a consequence two major drawbacks hinder the correct interpretation of field tracer tests either samples at late travel times are neglected and undocumented and or long time samples with measured low concentrations exist but they are under represented when plotting and analyzing them on a linear scale this study interprets entire breakthrough curves from an alpine karst field site including the significant low concentrations at late travel times principally in terms of application of a ctrw approach for comparison we examine the ade and 2rne models as they have been applied in a considerable number of recent studies that analyze btc measurements from karst aquifers e g doummar et al 2018 barbera et al 2018 ender et al 2018 geyer et al 2007 data from field tracer tests at the kilometer scale in the hochifen gottesacker austria area are shown goldscheider 2005 which have not been modeled previously as well as newly presented data the main objectives are to i identify a modeling framework that can quantify the entire evolution of a btc including the critical long time tails that contribute low but significant concentrations of chemicals over extended periods ii improve the general understanding of transport characteristics in karst aquifers and iii evaluate variability and scale dependencies of model transport parameters by examining different sampling locations along the flow paths to the authors knowledge this is the first application of the ctrw approach to kilometer scale field data and at the same time the first application to a karst aquifer 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the karst test site is located in the northern alps at the border between germany bavaria and austria vorarlberg it belongs to the helvetic zone which plunges on three sides underneath the flysch nappes consisting of marl and sandstone formations wyssling 1986 the most important helvetic rock formation is the cretaceous 75 125 m thick schrattenkalk limestone layer which forms the surface of the gottesacker terrain goldscheider 2005 and acts as main aquifer at the contact between the karst aquifer the schrattenkalk limestone and the impermeable layers the overlying marl and flysch deposits the schwarzwasser valley formed fig 1 previous research goldscheider 2005 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 has shown that the orientation of the underground flow paths is structurally controlled in total 19 tracer tests were carried out covering the test site from the schwarzwasser valley to the top of the gottesacker terrain and the expected water divide with the neighboring valley the major outcomes are as follows at the top parts of the gottesacker terrain the aquifer base is above the local hydrological base and the underground flow paths follow the dip of the strata toward the axis of the synclines the syncline axes themselves plunge toward the southeast under the schwarzwasser valley they act as the main drainage axes whereas anticlines are local water divides along the entire schwarzwasser valley there is a continuous karst aquifer below the valley axis fig 1b that collects groundwater from the more elevated areas of the gottesacker terrain and also receives inflow from the bordering flysch area the karst aquifer system is essentially drained by three major outlets an estavelle e in fig 1 i e a cave that acts as swallow hole during low flow conditions and transforms into a spring during high flow conditions a temporal karst spring aubach spring au a perennial karst spring saegebach spring sb and two smaller springs that are not considered here at the injection points ip i ip gb and ip e tracer is injected into actively sinking surface waters these injection sites are located along the valley axis the longest flow path between injection and sampling location is 7400 m between ip i and sb ip ga is located close to the syncline running from north of mount hochifen to the schwarzwasser valley where it joins the valley parallel flow path the flow path length to sb is about 6375 m during the field tracer tests either the fluorescent dye uranine cas rn 518 47 8 or eosin cas rn 17372 87 1 was used as a conservative tracer goldscheider 2005 water samples of 50 ml were taken at the springs for laboratory analysis of uranine and eosin which were analyzed with perkinelmer ls 50b and ls 55 spectrofluorometers for analysis the samples were adjusted with 50 μl of ph 10 buffer for uranine and ph 4 6 buffer for eosin respectively to achieve the maximum fluorescence intensity following the standard procedure reported in käss 2004 detection limits are exceptionally low for uranine 0 005 μg l and eosin 0 05 μg l volumetric fluid discharge q at each spring was determined by salt dilution method leibundgut et al 2009 the tracer concentrations are shown as normalized concentrations c q m recov where m recov is the recovered tracer mass shapiro et al 2008 this allows a direct comparison of i different sampling locations with different discharges and recovered masses as well as ii different tests discharges and recovered masses at one sampling location 2 2 data analysis mean flow conditions during the experiments are chosen to model the tracer btcs the analysis conceptualizes the flow and transport domain as an effective essentially one dimensional scenario for tracer transport this is applied in the comparisons of the ctrw 2rne and ade models below the simplification of applying a one dimensional model can be justified as bulk flow through karst conduits can be ascribed as one dimensional chen et al 2017 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 the recovery rates r are calculated using the flow rate q determined at the spring outlets 1 r 1 m t 0 q c d t where m is the injected tracer mass and c is the aqueous concentration at time t leibundgut et al 2009 in each of the three model analyses ctrw 2rne ade measures of error between model solutions and data are quantified in terms of the coefficient of determination r2 and the mean absolute percentage error mape 2 3 continuous time random walk ctrw model the btcs presented here are principally evaluated using the ctrw approach berkowitz et al 2006 2016 cortis et al 2005 detailed expositions of the theory development and implementation of ctrw models are given in e g berkowitz et al 2006 2016 a brief review of the main aspects is presented here for convenience the ctrw framework accounts for fluctuations in the flow field and in concentrations of migrating chemicals tracers in terms of probability distributions which lead to non fickian or anomalous transport behavior as a consequence the ctrw can effectively describe chemical transport and reactions where relevant over a range of length and time scales chemical transport is conceptualized by using particles to represent dissolved chemical species these particles migrate as a random walk through the domain by following spatiotemporal transitions spatial displacements governed by structural heterogeneity together with the time taken for each of these displacements a key feature of the ctrw approach is that the full probability distribution of particle transition times is considered via a probability density function ψ s t that couples the spatial displacement s and time t of each particle transition in general it is sufficient and convenient to decouple the function in the form ψ s t p s ψ t with ψ t the probability rate for a transition time t between sites and p s the probability distribution of the transition lengths dentz et al 2008 the governing ctrw transport equation based on a generalized master equation can be written as an integro partial differential equation in a continuum ensemble averaged system as 2 c s t t 0 t d t m t t v ψ c s t d ψ c s t where c s t is the normalized concentration m is a memory function and the dyadic symbol denotes a tensor product the characteristic transport particle velocity v ψ and d ψ the generalized dispersion are defined in terms of the first and second moments of p s equation 2 can be written in laplace space as 3 u c s u c o s m u v ψ c s u d ψ c s u where the laplace transform of the memory function is m u t u ψ u 1 ψ u with t a characteristic time denoting laplace space and u denoting the laplace variable it is emphasized that in this formulation and as distinct from the classical ade and related models such as the 2rne model discussed below v ψ is not identical to the mean fluid velocity and d ψ is not a simple spread around a mean fluid velocity in fact the mean particle and fluid velocities in heterogeneous porous and fractured domains are rarely the same because of structural hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity the identifiable interrogation or sampling of the domain by water and chemical tracers is actually distinct to explain while both chemical tracers and water molecules undergo in addition to advection diffusive and dispersive transport mechanisms the water molecules are not tagged identifiable as such diffusive and dispersive effects on bulk movement of water are not generally observable in contrast to clearly identifiable chemical tracers as a consequence the effective overall transport of a chemical tracer may be notably faster or in other cases slower than the average fluid velocity the choice of ψ t determines the definition of the memory function and is thus a foundation of the ctrw development a convenient and effective form of ψ t is that of a truncated power law discussed in detail in e g berkowitz et al 2006 2016 this form accounts for the possible evolution from non fickian to fickian behavior at relatively long travel times 4 ψ t n t 1 exp t t 2 1 t t 1 1 β 0 β 2 with n being a normalization constant defined as 5 n t 1 t 2 β exp t 1 t 2 γ β t 1 t 2 and where γ β t 1 t 2 denotes the incomplete gamma function the power law exponent β characterizes the degree of domain heterogeneity and of non fickian transport transport is fickian for β 2 this form of ψ t behaves as a power law leading to non fickian transport proportional to t t 1 1 β for particle transition times in the range t 1 t t 2 for transition times t t 2 ψ t decreases exponentially leading to fickian transport significantly when ψ t is exponential m u 1 and the ctrw transport equation 2 or 3 simplifies exactly to the ade as shown in 6 below e g berkowitz et al 2006 similarly mobile immobile and multirate models such as the 2rne model for example can also be derived as specialized cases of ctrw with appropriate choice of ψ t in 4 and 5 the characteristic time appearing in the memory function is chosen as t 1 which represents the onset of the power law region for the tracer tests reported here the ctrw model uses a robin type boundary condition at the inlet and a neuman type boundary condition at the outlet on the basis of extensive numerical simulations laboratory experiments and field measurements the ctrw framework has been demonstrated to successfully quantify subsurface chemical transport berkowitz et al 2006 2016 from pore to local field scales in the discussion below to distinguish the ctrw model parameters from the other two models 2rne ade the one dimensional variables v ψ and d ψ as well as β are hereafter denoted v ctrw d ctrw and β ctrw the ctrw model solutions were implemented using the freely downloadable software package reported in cortis et al 2005 2 4 advection dispersion equation ade and two region non equilibrium 2rne models for comparison and as a benchmark the btcs are also evaluated by a one dimensional ade 6 c t d 2 c x 2 v m c x with the mean fluid velocity v m and dispersion d acting as fitting parameters advection can be expressed as mean transit time t 0 or mean fluid velocity v m l t 0 with l flow path length the longitudinal dispersion d can be expressed in terms of the longitudinal dispersivity α d v m note that here diffusion is assumed negligible in the discrete karst conduits normalized concentrations c q m recov were used for all three models for the ade and 2rne models the normalized mass a which corresponds to the integral of the btc was used as an additional fitting parameter during the estimation procedure for an ideal fit r2 1 the normalized mass yields the value a 1 as shown below and as known already from the literature barbera et al 2018 geyer et al 2007 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 btcs with late time tails cannot be reproduced by the ade therefore the two region non equilibrium 2rne model is considered here the 2rne is based on the ade and describes the solute exchange between mobile and immobile fluid regions as a first order mass transfer process using two coupled equations toride et al 1999 for convenience the dimensionless form is given here modified after field and pinsky 2000 toride et al 1999 7 β 2 r n e c 1 t 1 p e 2 c 1 z 2 c 1 z ω c 1 c 2 8 1 β 2 r n e c 2 t ω c 1 c 2 where c represents the dimensionless solute concentration and t and z are dimensionless time and space variables respectively the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the mobile and immobile fluid regions respectively the dimensionless partitioning coefficient β 2rne 0 β 2rne 1 indicates the proportion of mobile water while the mass transfer coefficient ω 0 describes the exchange rate between the fluid regions the ade and 2rne model solutions were implemented using the software cxtfit toride et al 1999 for the ade and 2rne a dirac delta input function was used toride et al 1999 in low permeability media such as fractured rock tracer diffusion into the host porous matrix can be an important physical mechanism that affects the btcs bodin et al 2003 käss 2004 leibundgut et al 2009 zhou et al 2007 for long travel times compared to the peak travel time matrix diffusion causes a t 3 2 dependency of the concentration hadermann and heer 1996 tsang 1995 this is easily visible on a log log plot of concentration versus time where the tails of the btcs have a slope of 3 2 bodin et al 2003 in this context we examined the long time slopes of the btcs presented here 3 results and discussion 3 1 general characterization of the btcs at the karst springs measurements of the conservative tracers provide solid evidence of the underground connections between the injection points and the sampling locations aubach and saegebach springs which are located at flow path lengths ranging from 1000 m between ip e and aubach spring to 7400 m between ip i and saegebach spring fig 1 as the underground flow follows geological structures essentially synclines and the axis of the main valley and is comparatively well known from tracer tests geology and observations in caves goldscheider 2005 the distances between injection sites and springs are not given as linear distances but as distances along the generalized flow paths i e flow path lengths as shown in fig 1b which is more realistic than linear distance the actual flow path lengths in the underground are unknown but could be estimated by multiplying the generalized flow path lengths with tortuosity which is typically around 1 4 but can range between 1 1 and 3 9 in karst aquifers assari and mohammadi 2017 all injection sites with test numbers and sampling sites along with the individual distances are shown in the schematic sketch fig 1d all measured btcs show significant and long later time tailing with a steep early time rising limb representative btcs are shown in fig 2 the total recoveries of the injections range for aubach and saegebach springs from 10 9 to 81 8 table 2 depending on flow conditions and injection site in this highly developed karst conduit system there is no apparent dependency of the recovery rate on the tracer substance used the remaining quantities were partly recovered at the estavelle when it acted as spring during high flow conditions and at two smaller springs between au and sb that were not included in the analyses for this paper additionally infiltration into deeper parts of the aquifer can be assumed goldscheider 2005 generally though these values for recovery are in the range of what can be expected for karst aquifers goldscheider and drew 2007 for ip e results are available for different mean flow conditions in the range q au 133 300 l s data from the tests 1 2 3 and 5 appear in goldscheider 2005 while data from test 4 are new none of these data have been modeled previously thus the field tracer tests allow study in the context of the ctrw model as well as the 2rne and ade models of tracer transport parameters for the flow path along the entire schwarzwasser valley ip i ip gb ip e tracer transport parameters for the flow path following the syncline axis from the top of gottesacker and in the schwarzwasser valley ip ga the influence of hydrological conditions on tracer transport parameters via multiple injections into ip e the measured btcs were analyzed and interpreted using the ctrw 2rne and ade models representative fits to the btcs are shown in fig 2 and summaries of all fitted transport parameter values in the models are shown in table 1 ctrw model and table 2 ade and 2rne models referring first to the ctrw model it is evident from fig 2 that the full evolution of the btcs but particularly the distinctively long late time tailing is captured by the ctrw in contrast to the ctrw approach the ade and 2rne model solutions shown in fig 2 clearly do not capture this tailing although the 2rne shows somewhat longer tailing than the ade it should be emphasized that the late time concentrations while relatively low concentrations should not be ignored contaminants at low μg l to ng l levels are sufficient to significantly impact water quality over extended periods the long time tails of the btcs fig 2 are in the ng l range well above the detection limit of the fluorescent tracers the transport parameter values for all btc fits are shown in table 1 ctrw model and table 2 ade and 2rne models the poor fits of the ade solution explain the somewhat lower values for the coefficient of determination r2 of the ade ranging from 0 861 to 0 979 table 2 as compared to those of the 2rne and ctrw the values for the normalized mass a table 2 support this finding generally the values for the ade 0 67 0 89 are lower than for the 2rne 0 84 1 00 there are insignificant differences between the r2 values for the 2rne and ctrw however as the late time arrivals that involve low concentrations are of critical interest their error vanishes relative to that of the larger peak and earlier time concentrations as a consequence the mean absolute percentage error mape may be considered a better measure of the quality of model solution fits as seen in tables 1 and 2 the mape values for the ctrw model solution are in most cases significantly lower than those for the ade and 2rne solutions the poor matches of the 2rne and ade model solutions to the measurements may be ascribed to limiting assumptions in their basic formulation particularly that dispersive transport is fickian the conditions for the validity of this assumption and such models are discussed at length for example in berkowitz et al 2006 note too for example that the values of the mass transfer coefficient ω in the 2rne model which quantifies the exchange rate between two distinct mobile and immobile fluid regions do not display any uniformity or consistent trend in light of the results shown here the next section therefore focuses in more detail on the ctrw model and interpretation finally the role of matrix diffusion in these tracer tests was examined as noted at the end of section 2 4 the fingerprint for significant matrix diffusion is a long time btc slope of 3 2 on a log log plot of concentration versus time analysis of the long time slopes of the btcs for the aubach and saegebach springs and the injection points i gb e and ga indicates values between 1 94 and 4 95 which suggests that matrix diffusion can be neglected 3 2 impact of hydrological conditions distance and aquifer heterogeneity on solute transport the key parameter characterizing anomalous dispersive transport in the ctrw model β ctrw ranges from 1 19 to 1 36 for the three injection points along the schwarzwasser valley ip i gb and e and aubach spring and from 1 12 to 1 29 for the same injection points and saegebach spring table 1 the differences in the ranges of β ctrw for the aubach and saegebach springs are only minor standard deviations of 0 12 and 0 11 respectively this relatively narrow range of β ctrw values which quantifies the power law of the transition time distribution eq 4 over various pairs of injection and measurement points and a range of spring discharge rates q and with separation distances of up to several kilometers demonstrates a robust characterization in the ctrw framework quantifying anomalous transport recall fig 1d this result is also in accord with that of berkowitz and scher 2009 who analyzed btcs measured in heterogeneous sandpacks laboratory flow cells up to 2 1 m in length over a range of flow rates and demonstrated ctrw quantification with constant β ctrw values for the flow path along the syncline followed by the schwarzwasser valley ip ga the values of β ctrw are slightly larger with β ctrw 1 54 for aubach spring and β ctrw 1 58 for saegebach spring but strikingly similar the flow along the syncline axis in the upper part of the flow path might yield these higher values moreover the range of β ctrw values well below 2 confirms that the transport behavior is non fickian anomalous the overall strong heterogeneity of the karst aquifer hochifen gottesacker expressed by the β ctrw 2 appears highly justified for a well developed karst aquifer the general conceptual hydrogeological model of the aquifer comprises distinct conduits but also epikarst storage and rapid and slow flow reservoirs which represent the fractured rock matrix chen et al 2017 chen and goldscheider 2014 the different hydrological conditions are clear from the discharge recorded at the two karst springs table 1 for aubach spring the discharge ranges from 133 l s to 300 l s and saegebach spring from 203 l s to 370 l s during the tracer experiments saegebach spring receives additional groundwater inflow from the adjacent mahdtal valley and the hoelloch cave system goeppert and goldscheider 2008 goldscheider 2005 with the above in mind other transport parameters for the ctrw models can be examined to gain further insight into the impact of hydrological conditions distance and aquifer heterogeneity on solute transport properties first referring to the discussion following eq 4 it is seen from table 1 that the values of t 2 the cutoff time in eq 4 for the onset of fickian transport are as much as two orders of magnitude larger than the duration of the measurements these values range over various measurement distances and discharge rates which further confirms that the overall transport behavior in the karst aquifer is non fickian the values of t 1 the characteristic time for a tracer transition for the onset of the power law behavior in eq 4 are of the order of 0 1 1 min this range is reasonable in the context of average fluid velocities of 1 2 m min 50 100 m h table 2 determined from fitting the ade and 2rne model solutions to essentially the peak concentrations of the measured btcs the ctrw tracer transport velocities not fluid velocities recall the discussion in section 2 3 following eq 3 are in the range 108 401 m h and the generalized dispersion coefficients are in the range 351 6810 m2 h to place in perspective the ranges of fluid velocities and dispersion coefficients determined from fitting the ade and 2rne model solutions table 2 are in the range of what can be expected for karst aquifers goldscheider and drew 2007 as seen in table 1 the ctrw model tracer transport velocities v ctrw are larger than the fluid velocities estimated using the ade and 2rne models in accord with the discussion in section 2 3 and previous studies e g berkowitz et al 2006 note though that if the tracer transport velocity is nevertheless equated to the fluid velocity the range of values found here remains in the range of what can be expected in such karst aquifers goldscheider and drew 2007 finally it is of interest to examine correlations of the ctrw model parameter estimates of β ctrw v ctrw and d ctrw relative to the distance d between injection and sampling points as well as to estimates from other literature fig 3 presents plots showing how i d ctrw increases with v ctrw ii a generalized ctrw dispersivity d ctrw v ctrw increases with d and β ctrw remains relatively constant with d in comparison to selected laboratory tests with porous media edery et al 2015 kuntz et al 2011 these patterns becomes even clearer the analysis of kuntz et al 2011 includes a field doublet tracer test in a fractured weathered shale bedrock over a distance of 4 5 m to the authors knowledge there are no other available experimental field studies dealing with tracer transport and ctrw modeling for comparison especially at the kilometer scale the analysis of berkowitz et al 2008 used a modified two scale ctrw model to interpret a uranine tracer test in a single high porosity shear zone but the injection and extraction wells were separated by only 2 5 m from fig 3 a natural scale effect is observed between d ctrw and v ctrw fig 3a and between the generalized ctrw dispersivity d ctrw v ctrw and d most significantly though is that β ctrw the measure of heterogeneity and degree of anomalous transport essentially does not vary with scale the overall influence of the hydrological conditions on the transport properties of karst aquifers especially fluid velocity and dispersion as defined in terms of the ade is discussed in the literature barbera et al 2018 doummar et al 2018 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 käss 2004 and references therein morales et al 2007 typically the fluid velocity increases as the discharge increases and dispersion increases with distance analogous behavior is seen in the transport parameters obtained here by the ctrw model recent literature doubts the scaling of macrodispersivity in terms of the ade and fickian transport from field data and questions existence of a unique scaling law zech et al 2015 2019 which would facilitate easier prediction of groundwater flow by practitioners however zech at al 2015 focus on unconsolidated aquifers of low to medium heterogeneity and incorporate only tests with distances less than 3500 m their analysis also focuses entirely on parameters and parameter values obtained by assuming that transport is fickian and fully quantified by the ade model the present study deals with distances that are larger emphasizes karst aquifers and is predicated on a ctrw model that accounts intrinsically for non fickian transport and the measured long tailing while a unique scaling law cannot currently be drawn from the limited number of individual tests shown in fig 3 there does appear to be a general trend 3 3 environmental relevancy to delineate groundwater protection zones and in particular to delineate the inner protection zone zone ii a certain travel time is applied in germany the 50 day travel time from any point below the water table to the source is used while austria and denmark employ a 60 day travel time schmoll et al 2006 and switzerland adopted a 10 days travel time tracer tests are a highly recommended tool to acquire the required information to calculate the relevant parameters flow velocities for groundwater protection zoning schmoll et al 2006 therefore an appropriate method for modeling the transport parameters is needed given the great importance and potential risk of low concentrations of contaminants in the subsurface an improved understanding of the transport parameters and an approach considering subsurface heterogeneity is required which can interpreted using the ctrw framework future tasks could include implementation of a ctrw formulation into numerical groundwater modeling frameworks 4 conclusions and implications the ctrw framework widely adopted for laboratory investigations of porous media and numerical simulations of chemical transport effectively quantifies transport in the gottesacker hochifen karst aquifer the key parameter characterizing the degree of domain heterogeneity and anomalous transport β ctrw indicates non fickian anomalous transport and does not vary with flow distance the β ctrw parameter accounts for the heterogeneity of the karst aquifer which comprises an epikarst zone fractured rock matrix and conduits where this degree of heterogeneity is justified the investigation scale and fluid velocity influences the ctrw transport parameters for tracer velocity and dispersion a clear relationship is exhibited at this scale and may indicate a unique scaling law that might be advantageous to practitioners thus field tests appear to need a certain investigation scale to be significant to investigate low concentrations at late travel times in heterogeneous aquifers such as karst aquifers ctrw might be an important modeling tool that is able to simulate conservative solutes such as uranine the analysis here a first application of the ctrw approach to kilometer scale field data and first application to a karst aquifer can be extended to other reactive tracers and contaminants if these compounds are of interest application of the ctrw framework holds the potential for application to tracer test analyses from other field sites in porous or fractured aquifers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17914,data analytics is being deployed to predict the dissolved nitrous oxide n2o concentration in a full scale sidestream sequence batch reactor sbr treating the anaerobic supernatant on average the n2o emissions are equal to 7 6 of the nh4 n load and can contribute up to 97 to the operational carbon footprint of the studied nitritation denitritation and via nitrite enhanced biological phosphorus removal process scena the analysis showed that average aerobic dissolved n2o concentration could significantly vary under similar influent loads dissolved oxygen do ph and removal efficiencies a combination of density based clustering support vector machine svm and support vector regression svr models were deployed to estimate the dissolved n2o concentration and behaviour in the different phases of the sbr system the results of the study reveal that the aerobic dissolved n2o concentration is correlated with the drop of average aerobic conductivity rate spearman correlation coefficient equal to 0 7 the do spearman correlation coefficient equal to 0 7 and the changes of conductivity between sequential cycles additionally operational conditions resulting in low aerobic n2o accumulation 0 6 mg l were identified step feeding control of initial nh4 concentrations and aeration duration can mitigate the n2o peaks observed in the system the n2o emissions during aeration shows correlation with the stripping of accumulated n2o from the previous anoxic cycle the analysis shows that n2o is always consumed after the depletion of no2 during denitritation after the nitrite knee based on these findings svm classifiers were constructed to predict whether dissolved n2o will be consumed during the anoxic and anaerobic phases and svr models were trained to predict the n2o concentration at the end of the anaerobic phase and the average dissolved n2o concentration during aeration the proposed approach accurately predicts the n2o emissions as a latent parameter from other

streams lackner et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 the anaerobic supernatant is a by product of dewatering of the anaerobic digestion effluent and represents less than 1 2 of the total influent flow in the

2018 rodriguez garcia et al 2014 scena short cut enhanced nutrient abatement is a new sidestream process that combines the conversion of nh4 to no2 under aerobic conditions nitritation with the

volatile fatty acids vfas are produced via acidogenic fermentation of the primary and secondary sludge on site and dosed into the sbr in a recent study longo et al 2016 quantified the environmental and cost benefits and impacts of the integration of the scena process in a full scale wwtp they reported major energy savings for aeration after the integration of sidestream scena process the direct n2o emissions were equal to 1 42 of the influent n load short term monitoring campaigns were implemented while the effect of operational conditions on n2o generation was not investigated n2o is a potent cause of global warming its global warming potential is 265 298 times more than that of co2 ipcc 2013 the emission of n2o in full scale sidestream partial nitritation partial nitritation anammox or nitrification denitrification systems range from 0 17 to 5 1 of the influent n load average equal to 2 1 of the n load is emitted vasilaki et al 2019 schaubroeck et al 2015 showed that n2o emissions from a full scale sidestream demon process in austria were significantly higher than the direct n2o emissions from the mainstream treatment in a full scale wwtp on average 0 256 g n2o were emitted compared to 0 005 g emitted in the secondary treatment per m3 treated wastewater the increased direct n2o emissions can be mainly attributed to low do concentrations higher ammonia oxidation rates aor and no2 build up desloover et al 2011 kampschreur et al 2008 conditions that also prevail in the scena process the variability of ef reported in sidestream technologies can be partially attributed to both complex relationships between emitted n2o and operational conditions and different configurations i e sbr continuous systems loads i e nh4 concentrations feeding strategies and operational control i e do set points additionally different interactions between operational variables trigger a different response of n2o generation for instance in a recent modelling study of a granular one stage partial nitritation anammox reactor wan et al 2019 showed that higher temperatures resulted in increased n2o emissions in the presence of cod chemical oxygen demand and in decreased n2o emissions in the absence of cod due to increased anammox activity and reduction of no2 accumulation in higher temperature additionally the long term temporal variations of direct n2o emissions were not adequately assessed in sidestream technologies the majority of the monitoring campaigns in sidestream reactors lasted less than 5 days vasilaki et al 2019 the digitalisation of water services

facilitate the identification of patterns and hidden structures and reveal significant information on the behaviour of n2o emissions in continuous wastewater treatment processes vasilaki et al 2018 the sbr in the scena process is multiphase i e anaerobic aerobic anoxic conditions applying different operational variables unsynchronised data non linear and subject to different disturbances such as influent compositions and fermentation liquid characteristics moreover sbr process data are based on a 3d structure that consists of the number of i cycles ii variables and iii sampling points within

sensor and laboratory analyses data from a full scale scena sbr were analysed to provide insights on the n2o emissions behaviour and generation a structured approach was followed for knowledge

description and data origin the carbonera plant is designed to treat domestic wastewater of a population equivalent of 40 000 dry weather flow equal to 10 000 m3 d after screening and degritting and primary sedimentation the effluent from the primary clarifier is sent to a schreiber reactor single basin working volume 4671 m3 schreiber reactor effluent is pumped to two secondary clarifiers 2260 m3 each and subsequently to the tertiary treatment unit for disinfection and filtration before final discharge in the melma river waste activated sludge was generated by the biological treatment is recycled to the primary sedimentation unit and mixed with primary sludge the final concentration of the thickened mixed sludge is around 5 total solids ts about 75 of the mixed thickened sludge is fed to an anaerobic digestion unit 1800 m3 working volume digestate is dewatered by a centrifuge with the addition of polyelectrolyte the solid fraction is mechanically composted and used as agricultural fertilizer the anaerobic supernatant is sent to the equalization tank of 90 m3 in the scena system for the biological n and p removal the remaining portion of mixed sludge 25 is fed to a sequencing batch fermentation reactor sbfr with hydraulic retention time hrt equal to 5 days the sbfr is operated under mesophilic condition 37 c for the fermentation of thickened sewage sludge and the on site production of carbon source enriched of vfas mainly acetic and propionic acids daily around 10 m3 of fermentation sludge are extracted and replaced with fresh thickened sludge the solid liquid separation of the fermented sewage sludge is carried out by a screw press scae generating 2 4 m3 h of fermentation liquid rich of vfas in total 110 5 m3 d the latter is collected in a storage tank of 20 m3 and automatically dosed during the anaerobic and anoxic phases of a short cut sequencing batch reactor sbr based on ph and conductivity sensors the solid fermented fraction 13 15 ts based is mixed with the thickened mixed sludge and fed to the anaerobic digestor the anaerobic supernatant is treated in an sbr with a maximal working volume of 70 m3 3 4 cycles daily the sbr is fed with 7 9 m3 of anaerobic supernatant in each cycle that is treated via nitrite enhanced phosphorus removal associated with nitritation denitritation scena process the typical sbr fig 1 cycle consists of feeding 6 8 min anaerobic conditions 30 min aerobic conditions 200 240 min anoxic 60 140 min settling 30 min and discharge 8 min the sensors integrated in the sbr include ph dissolved oxygen do conductivity oxidation reduction potential orp mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and temperature conductivity and ph are used to control the length of the aerobic and anoxic phases and the carbon source dosage additionally variable frequency driver is used to control the air flow rate of the blowers maintaining the dissolved oxygen during aerobic phase in the range of 1 0 1 5 mg l the aeration system consists of volumetric blowers nominal power 11 kw and n80 diffusers invent providing 500 m3 h of compressed air at 400 mbar of pressure the treated supernatant is recirculated back to the wwtp headworks a monitoring campaign was conducted in the sidestream line at carbonera wwtp treatment plant for approximately 4 months january 2019 april 2019 dissolved n2o concentrations were measured using a polarographic clark type electrode unisense aarhus denmark to supplement the long term monitoring campaign with unisense probes n2o emissions in the headspace of the sbr reactor were also continuously monitored with mir9000cld analyser environment italia s p a during march april 2019 details of the monitoring campaign n2o emissions calculation and laboratory analyses are provided in the supplementary material s1 s3 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 methodological framework fig 2 summarises the methodological framework of the study phase one includes preliminary analysis of the collected data features extraction and density based clustering was applied ester et al 1996 to isolate abnormal cycles the methodology and results of abnormal cycles isolation are given in the supplementary material section s4 in phase two the behaviour of n2o emissions and dissolved n2o concentration during normal operation was investigated efforts were focused to identify dependencies with the operational dataset and laboratory analyses finally in phase three classification and regression models were trained to predict the behaviour of aerobic dissolved n2o concentration in the different cycles support vector machine classification svm and regression svr models were constructed cortes and vapnik 1995 the first step for the prediction of the average aerobic dissolved n2o concentration included the training of an svm classifier anoxsvm to predict whether dissolved n2o will be consumed during the anoxic phase this was significant given that accumulated dissolved n2o in the beginning of the aerobic phase will be stripped during aeration all cycles were divided in two classes class anoxa dissolved n2o 0 6 mg l and class anoxb dissolved n2o 0 6 mg l the dissolved n2o concentration threshold was set equal to 0 6 mg l since in 88 of these cases n2o was consumed by the end of subsequent anaerobic phase in cycles belonging to class anoxa no n2o carryover was assumed it is important to note that the term anaerobic phase is used to describe the first operational phase of the sbr fig 1 within each cycle and is not necessarily representative of the actual conditions in the reactor subsequently an svm classifier ansvm was trained to predict if dissolved n2o will be consumed in the subsequent anaerobic phase the threshold of n2o at the end of the anaerobic phase was set equal to 2 6 mg l sensor calibration limit therefore anaerobic phases with accumulated n2o were classified in two groups class anaera n2o concentration 2 6 mg l and anaerb n2o concentration 2 6 mg l cycles belonging to anaera class were used to train an svr model ansvr to predict the dissolved n2o concentration at the end of the anaerobic phase finally an svr model was trained to predict the average n2o concentration during the aerobic phase aersvr utilizing the ansvr model predictions for cycles with initial aerobic n2o less than 2 6 mg l finally the aerobic svr model was also tested to cycles belonging in class anaerb n2o concentration 2 6 mg l in anaerb cycles initial aerobic n2o accumulation exceeds the calibration limit of the sensor additionally aerobic n2o accumulation starts before completion of the stripping of pre existing dissolved n2o in these cases the average dissolved n2o concentration of the cycle was calculated considering the period from the first minimum of dissolved n2o concentration until the end of aeration or after 30 min if a local minimum did not exist additionally initial n2o accumulation was assumed to be equal to 0 6 mg l average minimum after initial n2o stripping observed in these cycles in practice the methodology followed was not linear as it is illustrated in fig 2 it involves several backward and forward loops between the different steps the feedback loops were necessary to leverage the knowledge discovered and adjust the data preparation i e new features extraction different pre processing and mining phases 2 2 2 support vector machines classification and support vector regression support vector machines svms are a range of supervised non parametric classification and regression algorithms that have various applications in several fields including hydrology raghavendra and deka 2014 bioinformatics byvatov and schneider 2003 and wastewater corominas et al 2018 for instance in wastewater support vector regression svr has been successfully applied to data generated from mechanistic modelling of biological processes fang et al 2011 or to experimental data seshan et al 2014 to predict reactors performance svm classification and svr models were constructed to predict the behaviour of dissolved n2o production consumption in different phases of the sbr operation fig 2 svm aims to define an optimum separating hyperplane in the feature space that maximizes the margin between two different classes classes with large margins are clearly separable and provide a safety for the generalisation of the algorithm when applied to new points in practical applications the overlapping of a number of data belonging to the two classes is common therefore soft margins are introduced to allow a number of misclassifications to identify feasible solutions when the training dataset is not strictly linearly separable similarly in the svr case the aim of the method is to identify the hyperplane that has the minimum distance to all data points a complete description of the svm and svr algorithms is provided in the supplementary material radial basis function rbf is a widely used kernel function and was selected to construct the models in this study the kernel trick enables svms to operate even in infinite feature space where data are mapped without in practice executing calculations there luts et al 2010 the algorithms were implemented with the kernlab package karatzoglou et al 2004 in r software repeated 10 fold cross validation 3 repetitions was applied to select the cost and gamma γ regularization parameters over a grid search with the caret package kuhn 2008 the cost determines the penalty of misclassified instances or instances violating the maximal margin whereas γ determines the amplitude of the kernel the dataset was randomly divided into test and train with 70 of the available data used for training the svm model and 30 used for testing in the classification case over sampling was applied for the minority classes within the 10 fold cross validation loop before training local models were developed based on observations from each phase of the sbr reactor instead of the dataset from the duration of the whole cycle the underlying characteristics and dependencies of the operational variables vary between anoxic aerobic and anaerobic conditions additionally the performance of the system under different phases within the cycle can also vary there are significant benefits in the development of local phase based models the behaviour of dissolved n2o and triggering operational conditions vary between the different phases local models enable to investigate the phase based dependency structures that would not be possible using the whole cycle dataset the performance of the classification svm models were evaluated based on accuracy and kappa and from the sensitivity and specificity as described in the supplementary material s3 1 similarly the regression models were evaluated considering the root mean squared error rmse and r squared r2 s3 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 scena performance the sbr treats up to 43 kg of n day of anaerobic supernatant which results in a volumetric nitrogen loading rate up to 0 62 kgn m3 day the performance of the sbr reactor in terms of nh4 n removal was stable during the monitoring campaign during system s normal operation january 2019 april 2019 the average removal efficiency of nh4 n tn and po4 p was 78 77 and 78 respectively influent and effluent concentrations of the scena system for the duration of the monitoring campaign are provided in table 1 a detailed description of the abnormal cycles isolated is provided in the supplementary material 3 2 n2o emission factor n2o emissions were measured using a gas analyser march april 2019 on average 0 8 kg of n2o n was emitted in each cycle equivalent to 7 6 of the nh4 n load in the sbr in terms of the nh4 n removed the n2o ef was equal to 11 4 the emissions during the aerobic phase were considered n2o emissions exhibited significant variability ranging from 0 14 kg n2o n cycle 1 3 of nh4 n load to 2 kg n2o n cycle 19 of nh4 n load as shown in fig 3 a emission peaks higher than 1 5 kg n2o n cycle and the increasing trend observed close to the end of the monitoring campaign coincide with peaks in the conductivity change in the aerobic phase of the cycles fig 3 b laboratory analyses performed approximately four times per week did not demonstrate any significant changes in the influent cod nh4 n loads and removal efficiencies linked with the increasing trend of the emissions observed in fig 3 a given the wide range of the n2o emissions observed in the system in the following sections efforts were focused to identify triggering operational conditions 3 3 energy consumption vs n2o emissions the operational carbon footprint of the sidestream line was estimated using the direct ghg emissions from n2o and electricity consumption the electricity consumption was relatively steady over the monitoring period on average 5 4 kwh was consumed in the sbr for the removal of 1 kg of nh4 n from the anaerobic supernatant the average energy consumption of the sbr represented 77 of the total electricity consumption of the scena system on average 48 7 kg of co2eq are generated for the removal of 1 kg of nh4 n due to the direct n2o emissions and electricity consumption in the system the contribution of the total n2o emissions to the operational carbon footprint of the scena process ranged from 66 7 to 96 8 when all the equipment electricity consumption i e fermenter dynamic thickener were considered given the variability of the n2o emissions observed in the system fig 3 the kg of co2eq emitted per kg of nh4 n removed ranged between 9 5 kg co2eq to 117 7 kg co2eq fig 4 a shows the average operational carbon footprint considering direct n2o emissions and electricity consumption of the scena system for two cases with different ranges of n2o emissions in the first case 26 03 a considerable amount of n2o was emitted equal to 10 5 of the influent nh4 n load in the second case the emissions were significantly lower equal to 4 of the influent nh4 n load both cases are characterised by similar influent nh4 n concentrations phase duration temperature and ammonia removal efficiencies 79 the do concentration is equal to 1 mg l in case 1 the operational carbon footprint of the process is 136 higher compared to case 2 this example shows that under similar conditions considering laboratory analyses average ph and do dissolved n2o concentrations can vary significantly in the studied system investigation of the behaviour of conductivity during the two aerobic phases showed higher conductivity and ph decrease in case one 510 μs cm and 1 respectively compared to case two 350 μs cm and 0 7 respectively fig 4 b and c additionally the initial aerobic orp in case 2 was higher 43 mv compared to case 1 274 mv fig 4 b therefore efforts to understand the n2o triggering operational conditions and mitigate ghg emissions should consider the dynamic in cycle behaviour of the variables monitored in the system the relationship between the operational variables i e do nh4 n concentration orp conductivity will be discussed in the following sections 3 4 variability of n2o emissions during normal operation n2o was emitted during aeration phase in all cycles and correlated significantly with the dissolved n2o accumulation one representative cycle profile for the dissolved n2o concentration and n2o emissions in cycles starting without dissolved n2o accumulation from the previous cycle is shown in fig 5 together with the do nh4 n conductivity orp and ph orp at the beginning of the aerobic phase shows a correlation with the do whereas n2o accumulation is minimum dissolved n2o increases in the first 60 70 min of aeration a small change in the ph slope can be seen coinciding with the peak of accumulated n2o indicating that the generated n2o is higher than the stripped n2o n2o accumulation shows a decreasing trend after 90 min of aeration subsequently dissolved n2o concentration increases when aeration stops and the anoxic phase starts this shows that production of n2o continues under decreasing do and until do depletion the calibration range of the dissolved n2o probe is between 0 and 2 6 mg l therefore the accumulation of dissolved n2o can be higher than the peak shown in fig 5 during the anoxic phase ph increases rapidly during the dosage of fermentation liquid followed by a slow decrease upon the end of carbon dosage phase a sudden change in the orp signal slope nitrite knee indicates the depletion of nitrite whereas tn still exists in the form of n2o accumulated n2o is subsequently depleted rapidly after no2 n depletion 3 5 the pattern of n2o emissions offline data from laboratory studies and the ranges of the operational variables were analysed in order to investigate significant changes that contribute to high accumulation of dissolved n2o concentration and high n2o emissions fig 6 a shows the daily average dissolved n2o concentration coloured points during aerobic phase versus conductivity at the end of aerobic phase and the effluent nh4 n concentration conductivity is significantly related and can be linked with the nh4 n concentration in the reactor spearman correlation coefficient equal to 0 97 high average aerobic dissolved n2o concentration 1 5 mg l was mainly observed with nh4 n concentrations lower than 150 mg l and higher than 300 mg l in the effluent of the sbr additionally the spearman correlation coefficient between dissolved n2o and average aerobic conductivity decrease rate μs cm min was equal to 0 7 and n2o concentration peaks were observed for conductivity decrease rate 1 8 μs cm min the latter indicates that higher emissions occur under high ammonia removal efficiency that can be linked with higher ammonia oxidation rates aor i e due to ph values observed 8 triggering the nh2oh oxidation pathway or higher than average no2 n accumulation triggering nitrifier denitrification pathway domingo félez et al 2014 found that n2o production rates were positively correlated with the extant nitrification rate in a single stage nitritation anammox reactor similarly law et al 2011 identified a linear relationship between aor and n2o emissions in a partial nitritation sbr reactor treating the reject water from anaerobic digestion law et al 2011 suggested that is attributed to higher accumulation of the ammonium oxidation intermediates hydroxylamine nh2oh and nitrosyl radical noh leading to faster n2o formation or to the increased use of electrons reducing nitrite to nitric oxide nitrifier denitrification pathway under low do concentrations high nitrite accumulation has been also linked with elevated n2o emissions and the nitrifier denitrification pathway especially under low do concentrations tallec et al 2006 kampschreur et al 2008 desloover et al 2011 peng et al 2015 massara et al 2017 law et al 2012 for instance peng et al 2017 and kampschreur et al 2009 in a nitritation denitritation sbr and a full scale single stage nitritation anammox reactor respectively identified linear relationship between nitrite accumulation and n2o emissions at do levels below 1 5 mg l similarly tallec et al 2006 in a nitrifying activated sludge observed eightfold increase of n2o emissions with the addition of nitrite pulses 10 mg l at do equal to 1 mg l therefore both hydroxylamine oxidation and the nitrifier denitrification are possible during aeration in the investigated sbr the average dissolved n2o concentration during the aerobic phase of different cycles varied significantly in relation to the average do concentration fig 6 b shows that the dissolved n2o concentration peaks coincided with average do concentrations less than 0 9 1 mg l the spearman correlation coefficient between dissolved n2o and do concentrations was equal to 0 7 the coloured points in the figure represent the orp at the end of the aerobic phase orp is higher than 40 mv in the majority of the cycles with average aerobic dissolved n2o concentration less than 1 mg l only cycles without dissolved n2o accumulation from the previous anoxic phase are shown in the graph stenström et al 2014 showed decreasing do concentrations lower than 1 1 5 mg l are linked with higher nitrite accumulation and are positively correlated with n2o emissions during nitrification in a full scale predenitrification nitrification sbr treating anaerobic supernatant similarly pijuan et al 2014 reported an increase of n2o emissions in a nitritation reactor with the reduction of do from 4 to 1 mg l during the monitoring period blowers operated at maximum flow rate therefore the presence of residual biodegradable cod concentration in the aerobic is expected to decrease do concentration similarly higher influent nh4 loads or higher ammonia oxidation rates that can also result in increased no2 accumulation can impact the do concentration in the system the dissolved n2o concentration can be affected by a combination of variables therefore it cannot be deduced that the decreased do is the sole contributing factor triggering the increased n2o generation observed 3 6 impact of accumulated n2o in the end of anoxic and anaerobic phase several parameters have been reported to affect the n2o accumulation under anoxic conditions such as the inhibition of the nitrous oxide reductase nos by free nitrous acid fna or high accumulation of no2 the electron competition between electron acceptors and the type of carbon source itokawa et al 2001 pan et al 2013 zhou et al 2008 zhu and chen 2011 additionally low values of cod n can result in incomplete denitritation and therefore n2o accumulation via the heterotrophic denitrification pathway during the anoxic phase of the sbr accumulated n2o in the end of the anoxic phase is stripped in the subsequent cycle increasing the n2o emissions caranto et al 2016 have recently showed that n2o can be the main product of anaerobic nh2oh oxidation catalysed by the cytochrome p460 in n europaea the latter can be an evidence of the biological n2o generation under limited do and high nh3 concentrations both conditions occurring in the target system in the during the transition from aerobic to anoxic phases when n2o accumulation rapidly increases in this study the average soluble cod concentration in the fermentation liquid was equal to 13082 mg cod l over the monitoring period table 1 overall in 27 of the examined cycles the n2o was completely consumed by the end of the anoxic phase zhu and chen 2011 showed that the use of sludge alkaline fermentation liquid as carbon source in an anaerobic aerobic system treating high strength stream can reduce the n2o production by up to 68 7 compared to alternative carbon sources i e acetic acid on the other hand li et al 2013a in a process utilizing pha as internal carbon source observed higher n2o production and reduction rates at higher influent cod concentrations linked with higher anaerobic pha synthesis ranging from 100 to 500 mg l the higher n2o production rates were attributed to the accumulated no2 inhibiting the n2o reduction the dissolved n2o concentration in the anoxic phase exceeded the calibration limit of the sensors only cycles in which nitrite knee was observed and n2o reduced to values lower than 2 6 mg l could be investigated therefore the effect on no2 in anoxic n2o generation could not be studied however studies have shown that elevated no2 concentrations during denitrification can reduce the denitrification rate and increase the n2o accumulation schulthess et al 1995 the electron competition between nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductace nos is intensified under high no2 concentrations nos is less competitive under limitation of electron donor and this will result in n2o accumulation pan et al 2013 ren et al 2019 based on the profiles shown in fig 5 n2o was always consumed after the depletion of no2 during denitritation specifically dissolved n2o concentration decreased after the nitrite knee gabarró et al 2014 studied a partial nitritation reactor treating landfill leachate and operated under alternating aerobic anoxic conditions to allow heterotrophic denitritation the authors demonstrated that significant n2o accumulation was observed during anoxic periods no2 denitrification rate was higher under both biodegradable cod limiting conditions and after acetate addition compared to n2o reduction n2o reduction rate was maximum after no2 removal similar to what was observed in this study in denitrifying phosphorus removal processes li et al 2013 a b showed that the n2o accumulation can be higher compared to conventional denitrification the authors suggested that in the electron competition between denitrifying enzymes and pha n2o reductase is less competitive on the other hand ribera guardia et al 2016 investigated the electron competition during denitrification pha as the sole carbon source of enriched dpao and dgao biomass and found that higher n2o accumulation in the latter culture additionally the last step of denitrification was inhibited in dgao cultures n2o accumulation up to 84 of the n reduced under high levels of no2 15 mgn gvss whereas n2o consumption in dpao biomass was not affected wang et al 2015 demonstrated that during denitrifying phosphorus removal mitigation of no2 accumulation is possible via continuous dosage of phosphate and nitrate wang et al 2011 showed that optimisation of the synthesis of pha during the anaerobic phase can mitigate the n2o production during the anoxic phase leading to complete denitrification in the system n2o emissions and dissolved n2o concentration in the aerobic phase is strongly related with incomplete denitritation in the previous cycle in 26 of the cycles with incomplete denitritation the n2o concentration did not decrease below 2 mg l in the anaerobic phase and therefore the stripping of accumulated n2o in the subsequent aerobic phase was substantial fig 7 a shows representative profiles of the dissolved n2o concentration and the n2o emissions based on different initial concentrations of n2o in the beginning of the aerobic phase the profiles of the orp do and ph are comparable in the preseted cycles fig 7 b in cycle b 0 56 kgn of n2o were emitted during the aerobic phase wheareas in cycle a n2o emissions are equal to 0 33 kgn given the duration of these cycles is not equal only 220 min were considered the initial dissolved n2o concentration in cycles a and b is equal to 0 27 and 2 6 mg l respectively the n2o emissions increased significantly due to the accumulated n2o at the beginning of the previous anoxic phase that was stripped at the beginning of aeration overall in 72 of the cycles the dissolved n2o concentration at the beginning of the anaerobic phase was higher than 0 3 mg l in cycles with dissolved n2o concentration higher than 0 3 mg l at the beginning of the anaerobic phase the change in dissolved n2o concentration during the anaerobic phase was highly correlated with the orp at the beginning of the anaerobic phase additionally the spearman correlation coefficient between the magnitude of the orp reduction and magnitude of the dissolved n2o reduction was equal to 0 7 fig 8 shows the boxplots of dissolved n2o reduction in relation to initial anaerobic orp and orp change for two cases i negligible dissolved n2o change mainly due to influent dilution or anaerobic dissolved n2o concentration 2 6 mg l and ii occasions with n2o reduction during the anaerobic phase in fig 8 a only occassions with orp decrease higher than 50 mv are shown the presence of nitrites in the bulk liquid during the anaerobic phase affected the orp no2 n depletion in the bulk liquid resulted in a sharp nitrite knee in the orp profile similar to the one observed during the anoxic phase therefore higher orp change was expected in cycles with no2 n depletion and n2o consumption during the anaerobic phase anaerobic phase term is used to describe the first operational phase of the sbr fig 1 within each cycle and might not represent the actual conditions in the reactor for instance orp 80 mv in the anaerobic phase of the sbr indicates anoxic conditions due to residual no2 n concentration from the previous anoxic phase of the reactor 3 7 prediction and control of n2o accumulation in the anoxic and anaerobic phases as discussed in section 3 6 the behaviour of orp was significantly related with the behaviour of no2 and consequentially of the dissolved n2o concentration during the anaerobic phase therefore in the ansvm model features related with the orp profile were mainly used table 2 similarly there was a strong link with the orp behaviour and the nitrite knee with the n2o accumulation during the anoxic phase the features considered in anoxsvm model are shown in table 2 the classification matrices for train and test datasets of the ansvm and anoxsvm models are presented in table 3 the average classification accuracy for the anoxsvm model was equal to 99 and 97 for the test and validation datasets similar results were obtained for the anaerobic phase with 95 and 98 accuracy in the train and test datasets respectively jaramillo et al 2018 developed an svm classifier to estimate online the end of partial nitrification in a laboratory aerobic anoxic sbr based on features extracted from ph and do sensors over time windows resulting in 7 52 reduction in the operational time in this study the main focus was to estimate offline the behaviour of n2o emissions based on historical batch data the results from this study indicate that orp and ph sensor data can be used to detect the consumption of n2o during the nitritation nitrification in sbr reactors the results show that knowledge based feature extraction and svm classification could help in explaining the behaviour of the system and potentially optimise the control to consider the consumption of accumulated n2o i e in this system the denitritation can be stopped after the local maximum of the orp rate after the nitrite knee in all the cycles investigated fig 9 a and b illustrate the predicted and measured n2o concentration at the end of the anaerobic phase ansvr model the svr parameters were optimised based on the root mean square error using the train dataset rmse of the svr model was equal to 0 11 and 0 1 mg n2o n l for the train and test datasets respectively r squared equal to 0 85 and 0 75 respectively as shown in fig 9 b the simulation results follow the behaviour of the actual dissolved n2o concentrations observed one of the major factors affecting the performance is the limited number of data points but the prediction is still accurate 3 8 prediction of the n2o concentration in aerobic phase the input features are shown in table 4 and were selected based on the identified influential variables the n2o predicted values of the ansvr model were used anaerp the procedure followed for the selection of model parameters was similar to the respective one followed for the anaerobic phase additionally ansvr test dataset cycles were identified and used in aersvr test dataset a the model was also applied in anaerb cycles test dataset b fig 10 a shows the predicted and measured average aerobic n2o concentration for the trained and test datasets rmse of the svr model was equal to 0 06 and 0 11 mg n2o n l for the train dataset and test dataset a respectively whereas the r squared was equal to 0 94 and 0 82 fig 10 a and b the rmse of the predicted values for the test dataset b was equal to 0 29 mg n2o n l and the r squared was equal to 0 72 fig 10 a the aersvr model underpredicted the average dissolved n2o concentration of test b dataset this is expected given that in test b dataset cycles the initial aerobic n2o accumulation exceeds the sensor calibration limit therefore on many occasions the initial aerobic n2o accumulation was also underestimated section 2 2 1 anaerb cycles an example is shown if fig 11 in cycle a the average dissolved n2o concentration calculated as discussed in section 2 2 1 for anaerb cycles is equal to 1 33 mg l the aersvr model predicted 0 87 mg l underestimating the actual concentration considering initial accumulation equal to 0 6 mg l in cycle b the aersvr model predicted n2o concentration equal to 0 61 mg l considering initial accumulation equal to 0 6 the observed average dissolved n2o concentration after the local minimum was equal to 0 6 mg l the results show that under the investigated operational conditions the framework shown in fig 2 can provide a good estimation of the real dissolved n2o behaviour and concentration observed during the different phases of sbr operation instabilities in the performance of machine learning models due to changes in the operational conditions in wastewater bioreactors have been reported in the literature shi and xu 2018 therefore long term datasets and investigation of different patterns and dependencies should be investigated before model construction 3 9 mitigation strategy during aerobic phases elevated average dissolved n2o concentration was linked with do less than 1 mg l and increased conductivity decrease rates conductivity values represent nh4 n concentration values in the reactor therefore cycles with increased conductivity decrease rate indicate higher nh4 n removal efficiency and no2 n accumulation dissolved n2o concentrations lower than 0 6 mg l were identified in cycles with average do concentration equal to 1 36 mg l and conductivity decrease rate 1 8 μs cm min increasing the reactor do concentration to values higher than 1 3 mg l can result in decreased aerobic n2o generation law et al 2012 however with the current anaerobic supernatant feeding strategy blowers operate at maximum flowrate so it is not possible to increase the aeration in the system on the other hand the implementation of a step feeding strategy could foster the reduction of n2o emissions thanks to the lower nh4 n and free ammonia fa concentration at the beginning of the cycle which has been recognized as a triggering factor for n2o production desloover et al 2012 conductivity at the end of the cycle can act as surrogate to estimate the effluent nh4 n concentration of the reactor and optimise the anaerobic supernatant feeding load consequently the aerobic initial nh4 n concentration could be controlled to avoid either fa accumulation or high aor with subsequent n2o generation additionally frequent alternation of aerobic anoxic phases can be introduced in order to avoid high nitrite accumulation the impact of nitrite concentration on n2o production can be also minimized by ensuring adequate do levels within the reactor to inhibit the nitrifiers denitrification pathway blum et al 2018 law et al 2013 rodriguez caballero et al 2015 reported that in a full scale sbr treating municipal wastewater intermittent aeration alternation between 20 and 30 min oxic and anoxic led to a minimisation of n2o compared to long oxic periods that enhanced n2o emission the authors related this behaviour to the presence of shorter aeration times with subsequently lower nitrite accumulation and n2o production in addition su et al 2019 reported that slightly acidic or neutral ph in nitritation reactors at values that do not inhibit microbial activity can decrease n2o generation by up to seven times based on the ph profiles observed in this study regulation of aerobic alkalinity consumption phase duration can be also considered to control the ph at lower levels the developed models can be used to estimate rapidly and precisely the hard to measure n2o concentrations during aeration and detect n2o accumulation in non aerated phases additionally it can alert operators about cycles with anoxic and anaerobic n2o accumulation and elevated aerobic n2o concentrations that require modifications to the system operation the anoxsvm model can predict if n2o is consumed in anoxic phases or if anoxic duration should be extended thus additional provision of fermentation liquid can be performed to promote n2o consumption through denitritation when after 70 90 min the anoxic svm model still indicates incomplete denitritation this study provides evidence on the relationship of do orp and conductivity and ph with the dissolved n2o concentration in terms of correlation coefficients behaviour and thresholds that indicate specific ranges of n2o accumulation these findings together with the models developed in this study can be the basis for the development of intelligent control algorithms to integrate emissions control in sidestream sbr reactors performing nitritation partial nitritation or other systems similar to scena moreover features based on orp ph do and conductivity measurements in wastewater sbr processes that can be used to predict dissolved n2o concentrations have been identified the developed framework can be also tested in continuous processes for the data driven prediction of n2o emissions 4 conclusions knowledge discovery and data mining techniques were employed to extract useful information about the dynamic behaviour of n2o and to predict the behaviour of dissolved n2o concentration in a full scale sbr reactor treating the anaerobic supernatant the main conclusions are summarized as follows the n2o emissions in scena process varies from 1 3 to 19 of nh4 n load therefore they can contribute considerably to the operational carbon footprint of the process 90 on average average aerobic dissolved n2o concentration could significantly vary under similar influent loads do ph and removal efficiencies extracting information from the dynamic in cycle behaviour of the variables monitored in the system is a significant step towards understanding n2o behaviour aerobic dissolved n2o concentration peaks 1 mg l were observed in cycles with average do concentrations less than 0 9 1 mg l and orp concentration at the end of the aerobic phase less than 40 mv conductivity was correlated with the reactor nh4 n concentration 0 97 n2o peaks were also observed in cycles with elevated decrease of conductivity during aeration step feeding control of initial nh4 n concentrations and control of ph via the regulation of aerobic phase duration can mitigate the n2o peaks observed in this study the accumulated n2o at the end of the sbr anoxic phase was stripped in the subsequent aerobic phase and had a significant impact on the amount of n2o emitted the accumulated n2o was consumed rapidly after nitrite knee that was linked with the nitrite depletion the anoxsvm model can be used to detect if anoxic duration should be extended or additional fermentation liquid provided to enhance n2o consumption in anoxic phases this study shows that low cost sensors conventionally used to monitor sbr systems i e ph do orp have good capabilities to predict the dissolved n2o behaviour and concentrations when couple with knowledge discovery techniques the aersvr model showed reliable estimations of the aerobic n2o concentration and can provide guidance to wwtps operators on whether n2o levels are acceptable or mitigation actions are required declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17914,data analytics is being deployed to predict the dissolved nitrous oxide n2o concentration in a full scale sidestream sequence batch reactor sbr treating the anaerobic supernatant on average the n2o emissions are equal to 7 6 of the nh4 n load and can contribute up to 97 to the operational carbon footprint of the studied nitritation denitritation and via nitrite enhanced biological phosphorus removal process scena the analysis showed that average aerobic dissolved n2o concentration could significantly vary under similar influent loads dissolved oxygen do ph and removal efficiencies a combination of density based clustering support vector machine svm and support vector regression svr models were deployed to estimate the dissolved n2o concentration and behaviour in the different phases of the sbr system the results of the study reveal that the aerobic dissolved n2o concentration is correlated with the drop of average aerobic conductivity rate spearman correlation coefficient equal to 0 7 the do spearman correlation coefficient equal to 0 7 and the changes of conductivity between sequential cycles additionally operational conditions resulting in low aerobic n2o accumulation 0 6 mg l were identified step feeding control of initial nh4 concentrations and aeration duration can mitigate the n2o peaks observed in the system the n2o emissions during aeration shows correlation with the stripping of accumulated n2o from the previous anoxic cycle the analysis shows that n2o is always consumed after the depletion of no2 during denitritation after the nitrite knee based on these findings svm classifiers were constructed to predict whether dissolved n2o will be consumed during the anoxic and anaerobic phases and svr models were trained to predict the n2o concentration at the end of the anaerobic phase and the average dissolved n2o concentration during aeration the proposed approach accurately predicts the n2o emissions as a latent parameter from other low cost sensors that are traditionally deployed in biological batch processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords short cut enhanced nutrients abatement scena long term dissolved n2o and energy

2018 rodriguez garcia et al 2014 scena short cut enhanced nutrient abatement is a new sidestream process that combines the conversion of nh4 to no2 under aerobic conditions nitritation with the

volatile fatty acids vfas are produced via acidogenic fermentation of the primary and secondary sludge on site and dosed into the sbr in a recent study longo et al 2016 quantified the environmental and cost benefits and impacts of the integration of the scena process in a full scale wwtp they reported major energy savings for aeration after the integration of sidestream scena process the direct n2o emissions were equal to 1 42 of the influent n load short term monitoring campaigns were implemented while the effect of operational conditions on n2o generation was not investigated n2o is a potent cause of global warming its global warming potential is 265 298 times more than that of co2 ipcc 2013 the emission of n2o in full scale sidestream partial nitritation partial nitritation anammox or nitrification denitrification systems range from 0 17 to 5 1 of the influent n load average equal to 2 1 of the n load is emitted vasilaki et al 2019 schaubroeck et al 2015 showed that n2o emissions from a full scale sidestream demon process in austria were significantly higher than the direct n2o emissions from the mainstream treatment in a full scale wwtp on average 0 256 g n2o were emitted compared to 0 005 g emitted in the secondary treatment per m3 treated wastewater the increased direct n2o emissions can be mainly attributed to low do concentrations higher ammonia oxidation rates aor and no2 build up desloover et al 2011 kampschreur et al 2008 conditions that also prevail in the scena process the variability of ef reported in sidestream technologies can be partially attributed to both complex relationships between emitted n2o and operational conditions and different configurations i e sbr continuous systems loads i e nh4 concentrations feeding strategies and operational control i e do set points additionally different interactions between operational variables trigger a different response of n2o generation for instance in a recent modelling study of a granular one stage partial nitritation anammox reactor wan et al 2019 showed that higher temperatures resulted in increased n2o emissions in the presence of cod chemical oxygen demand and in decreased n2o emissions in the absence of cod due to increased anammox activity and reduction of no2 accumulation in higher temperature additionally the long term temporal variations of direct n2o emissions were not adequately assessed in sidestream technologies the majority of the monitoring campaigns in sidestream reactors lasted less than 5 days vasilaki et al 2019 the digitalisation of water services

objective optimisation of control of water utilities corominas et al 2018 haimi et al 2013 newhart et al 2019 data mining and extraction of the information hidden in the raw sensor signals can facilitate the identification of patterns and hidden structures and reveal significant information on the behaviour of n2o emissions in continuous wastewater treatment processes vasilaki et al 2018 the sbr in the scena process is multiphase i e anaerobic aerobic anoxic conditions applying different operational variables unsynchronised data non linear and subject to different disturbances such as influent compositions and fermentation liquid characteristics moreover sbr process data are based on a 3d structure that consists of the number of i cycles ii variables and iii sampling points within

sensor and laboratory analyses data from a full scale scena sbr were analysed to provide insights on the n2o emissions behaviour and generation a structured approach was followed for knowledge

primary sedimentation the effluent from the primary clarifier is sent to a schreiber reactor single basin working volume 4671 m3 schreiber reactor effluent is pumped to two secondary clarifiers 2260 m3 each and subsequently to the tertiary treatment unit for disinfection and filtration before final discharge in the melma river waste activated sludge was generated by the biological treatment is recycled to the primary sedimentation unit and mixed with primary sludge the final concentration of the thickened mixed sludge is around 5 total solids ts about 75 of the mixed thickened sludge is fed to an anaerobic digestion unit 1800 m3 working volume digestate is dewatered by a centrifuge with the addition of polyelectrolyte the solid fraction is mechanically composted and used as agricultural fertilizer the anaerobic supernatant is sent to the equalization tank of 90 m3 in the scena system for the biological n and p removal the remaining portion of mixed sludge 25 is fed to a sequencing batch fermentation reactor sbfr with hydraulic retention time hrt equal to 5 days the sbfr is operated under mesophilic condition 37 c for the fermentation of thickened sewage sludge and the on site production of carbon source enriched of vfas mainly acetic and propionic acids daily around 10 m3 of fermentation sludge are extracted and replaced with fresh thickened sludge the solid liquid separation of the fermented sewage sludge is carried out by a screw press scae generating 2 4 m3 h of fermentation liquid rich of vfas in total 110 5 m3 d the latter is collected in a storage tank of 20 m3 and automatically dosed during the anaerobic and anoxic phases of a short cut sequencing batch reactor sbr based on ph and conductivity sensors the solid fermented fraction 13 15 ts based is mixed with the thickened mixed sludge and fed to the anaerobic digestor the anaerobic supernatant is treated in an sbr with a maximal working volume of 70 m3 3 4 cycles daily the sbr is fed with 7 9 m3 of anaerobic supernatant in each cycle that is treated via nitrite enhanced phosphorus removal associated with nitritation denitritation scena process the typical sbr fig 1 cycle consists of

conductivity oxidation reduction potential orp mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and temperature conductivity and ph are used to control the length of the aerobic and anoxic phases and the carbon source dosage additionally variable frequency driver is used to control the air flow rate of the blowers maintaining the dissolved oxygen during aerobic phase in the range of 1 0 1 5 mg l the aeration

headworks a monitoring campaign was conducted in the sidestream line at carbonera wwtp treatment plant for approximately 4 months january 2019 april 2019 dissolved n2o concentrations were measured using a polarographic clark type electrode unisense aarhus denmark to supplement the long term monitoring campaign with unisense probes n2o emissions in the headspace of the sbr reactor were also continuously monitored with mir9000cld analyser environment italia s p a during march april 2019 details of the monitoring campaign n2o emissions calculation and laboratory analyses are provided in the supplementary material s1 s3 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 methodological framework fig 2 summarises the methodological framework of the study phase one includes preliminary analysis of the collected data features extraction and density based clustering was applied ester et al 1996 to isolate abnormal cycles the methodology and results of abnormal cycles isolation are given in the supplementary material section s4 in phase two the behaviour of n2o emissions and dissolved n2o concentration during normal operation was investigated efforts were focused to identify dependencies with the operational dataset and laboratory analyses finally in phase three classification and regression models were trained to predict the behaviour of aerobic dissolved n2o concentration in the different cycles support vector machine classification svm and regression svr models were constructed cortes and vapnik 1995 the first step for the prediction of the average aerobic dissolved n2o concentration included the training of an svm classifier anoxsvm to predict whether dissolved n2o will be consumed during the anoxic phase this was significant given that accumulated dissolved n2o in the beginning of the aerobic phase will be stripped during aeration all cycles were divided in two classes class anoxa dissolved n2o 0 6 mg l and class anoxb dissolved n2o 0 6 mg l the dissolved n2o concentration threshold was set equal to 0 6 mg l since in 88 of these cases n2o was consumed by the end of subsequent anaerobic phase in cycles belonging to class anoxa no n2o carryover was assumed it is important to note that the term anaerobic phase is used to describe the first operational phase of the sbr fig 1 within each cycle and is not necessarily representative of the actual conditions in the reactor subsequently an svm classifier ansvm was trained to predict if dissolved n2o will be consumed in the subsequent anaerobic phase the threshold of n2o at the end of the anaerobic phase was set equal to 2 6 mg l sensor calibration limit therefore anaerobic phases with accumulated n2o were classified in two groups class anaera n2o concentration 2 6 mg l and anaerb n2o concentration 2 6 mg l cycles belonging to anaera class were used to train an svr model ansvr to predict the dissolved n2o concentration at the end of the anaerobic phase finally an svr model was trained to predict the average n2o concentration during the aerobic phase aersvr utilizing the ansvr model predictions for cycles with initial aerobic n2o less than 2 6 mg l finally the aerobic svr model was also tested to cycles belonging in class anaerb n2o concentration 2 6 mg l in anaerb cycles initial aerobic n2o accumulation exceeds the calibration limit of the sensor additionally aerobic n2o accumulation starts before completion of the stripping of pre existing dissolved n2o in these cases the average dissolved n2o concentration of the cycle was calculated considering the period from the first minimum of dissolved n2o concentration until the end of aeration or after 30 min if a local minimum did not exist additionally initial n2o accumulation was assumed to be equal to 0 6 mg l average minimum after initial n2o stripping observed in these cycles in practice the methodology followed was not linear as it is illustrated in fig 2 it involves several backward and forward loops between the different steps the feedback loops were necessary to leverage the knowledge discovered and adjust the data preparation i e new features extraction different pre processing and mining phases 2 2 2 support vector machines classification and support vector regression support vector machines svms are a range of supervised non parametric classification and regression algorithms that have various applications in several fields including hydrology raghavendra and deka 2014 bioinformatics byvatov and schneider 2003 and wastewater corominas et al 2018 for instance in wastewater support vector regression svr has been successfully applied to data generated from mechanistic modelling of biological processes fang et al 2011 or to experimental data seshan et al 2014 to predict reactors performance svm classification and svr models were constructed to predict the behaviour of dissolved n2o production consumption in different phases of the sbr operation fig 2 svm aims to define an optimum separating hyperplane in the feature space that maximizes the margin between two different classes classes with large margins are clearly separable and provide a safety for the generalisation of the algorithm when applied to new points in practical applications the overlapping of a number of data belonging to the two classes is common therefore soft margins are introduced to allow a number of misclassifications to identify feasible solutions when the training dataset is not strictly linearly separable similarly in the svr case the aim of the method is to identify the hyperplane that has the minimum distance to all data points a complete description of the svm and svr algorithms is provided in the supplementary material radial basis function rbf is a widely used kernel function and was selected to construct the models in this study the kernel trick enables svms to operate even in infinite feature space where data are mapped without in practice executing calculations there luts et al 2010 the algorithms were implemented with the kernlab package karatzoglou et al 2004 in r software repeated 10 fold cross validation 3 repetitions was applied to select the cost and gamma γ regularization parameters over a grid search with the caret package kuhn 2008 the cost determines the penalty of misclassified instances or instances violating the maximal margin whereas γ determines the amplitude of the kernel the dataset was randomly divided into test and train with 70 of the available data used for training the svm model and 30 used for testing in the classification case over sampling was applied for the minority classes within the 10 fold cross validation loop before training local models were developed based on observations from each phase of the sbr reactor instead of the dataset from the duration of the whole cycle the underlying characteristics and dependencies of the operational variables vary between anoxic aerobic and anaerobic conditions additionally the performance of the system under different phases within the cycle can also vary there are significant benefits in the development of local phase based models the behaviour of dissolved n2o and triggering operational conditions vary between the different phases local models enable to investigate the phase based dependency structures that would not be possible using the whole cycle dataset the performance of the classification svm models were evaluated based on accuracy and kappa and from the sensitivity and specificity as described in the supplementary material s3 1 similarly the regression models were evaluated considering the root mean squared error rmse and r squared r2 s3 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 scena performance the sbr treats up to 43 kg of n day of anaerobic supernatant which results in a volumetric nitrogen loading rate up to 0 62 kgn m3 day the performance of the sbr reactor in terms of nh4 n removal was stable during the monitoring campaign during system s normal operation january 2019 april 2019 the average removal efficiency of nh4 n tn and po4 p was 78 77 and 78 respectively influent and effluent concentrations of the scena system for the duration of the monitoring campaign are provided in table 1 a detailed description of the abnormal cycles isolated is provided in the supplementary material 3 2 n2o emission factor n2o emissions were measured using a gas analyser march april 2019 on average 0 8 kg of n2o n was emitted in each cycle equivalent to 7 6 of the nh4 n load in the sbr in terms of the nh4 n removed the n2o ef was equal to 11 4 the emissions during the aerobic phase were considered n2o emissions exhibited significant variability ranging from 0 14 kg n2o n cycle 1 3 of nh4 n load to 2 kg n2o n cycle 19 of nh4 n load as shown in fig 3 a emission peaks higher than 1 5 kg n2o n cycle and the increasing trend observed close to the end of the monitoring campaign coincide with peaks in the conductivity change in the aerobic phase of the cycles fig 3 b laboratory analyses performed approximately four times per week did not demonstrate any significant changes in the influent cod nh4 n loads and removal efficiencies linked with the increasing trend of the emissions observed in fig 3 a given the wide range of the n2o emissions observed in the system in the following sections efforts were focused to identify triggering operational conditions 3 3 energy consumption vs n2o emissions the operational carbon footprint of the sidestream line was estimated using the direct ghg emissions from n2o and electricity consumption the electricity consumption was relatively steady over the monitoring period on average 5 4 kwh was consumed in the sbr for the removal of 1 kg of nh4 n from the anaerobic supernatant the average energy consumption of the sbr represented 77 of the total electricity consumption of the scena system on average 48 7 kg of co2eq are generated for the removal of 1 kg of nh4 n due to the direct n2o emissions and electricity consumption in the system the contribution of the total n2o emissions to the operational carbon footprint of the scena process ranged from 66 7 to 96 8 when all the equipment electricity consumption i e fermenter dynamic thickener were considered given the variability of the n2o emissions observed in the system fig 3 the kg of co2eq emitted per kg of nh4 n removed ranged between 9 5 kg co2eq to 117 7 kg co2eq fig 4 a shows the average operational carbon footprint considering direct n2o emissions and electricity consumption of the scena system for two cases with different ranges of n2o emissions in the first case 26 03 a considerable amount of n2o was emitted equal to 10 5 of the influent nh4 n load in the second case the emissions were significantly lower equal to 4 of the influent nh4 n load both cases are characterised by similar influent nh4 n concentrations phase duration temperature and ammonia removal efficiencies 79 the do concentration is equal to 1 mg l in case 1 the operational carbon footprint of the process is 136 higher compared to case 2 this example shows that under similar conditions considering laboratory analyses average ph and do dissolved n2o concentrations can vary significantly in the studied system investigation of the behaviour of conductivity during the two aerobic phases showed higher conductivity and ph decrease in case one 510 μs cm and 1 respectively compared to case two 350 μs cm and 0 7 respectively fig 4 b and c additionally the initial aerobic orp in case 2 was higher 43 mv compared to case 1 274 mv fig 4 b therefore efforts to understand the n2o triggering operational conditions and mitigate ghg emissions should consider the dynamic in cycle behaviour of the variables monitored in the system the relationship between the operational variables i e do nh4 n concentration orp conductivity will be discussed in the following sections 3 4 variability of n2o emissions during normal operation n2o was emitted during aeration phase in all cycles and correlated significantly with the dissolved n2o accumulation one representative cycle profile for the dissolved n2o concentration and n2o emissions in cycles starting without dissolved n2o accumulation from the previous cycle is shown in fig 5 together with the do nh4 n conductivity orp and ph orp at the beginning of the aerobic phase shows a correlation with the do whereas n2o accumulation is minimum dissolved n2o increases in the first 60 70 min of aeration a small change in the ph slope can be seen coinciding with the peak of accumulated n2o indicating that the generated n2o is higher than the stripped n2o n2o accumulation shows a decreasing trend after 90 min of aeration subsequently dissolved n2o concentration increases when aeration stops and the anoxic phase starts this shows that production of n2o continues under decreasing do and until do depletion the calibration range of the dissolved n2o probe is between 0 and 2 6 mg l therefore the accumulation of dissolved n2o can be higher than the peak shown in fig 5 during the anoxic phase ph increases rapidly during the dosage of fermentation liquid followed by a slow decrease upon the end of carbon dosage phase a sudden change in the orp signal slope nitrite knee indicates the depletion of nitrite whereas tn still exists in the form of n2o accumulated n2o is subsequently depleted rapidly after no2 n depletion 3 5 the pattern of n2o emissions offline data from laboratory studies and the ranges of the operational variables were analysed in order to investigate significant changes that contribute to high accumulation of dissolved n2o concentration and high n2o emissions fig 6 a shows the daily average dissolved n2o concentration coloured points during aerobic phase versus conductivity at the end of aerobic phase and the effluent nh4 n concentration conductivity is significantly related and can be linked with the nh4 n concentration in the reactor spearman correlation coefficient equal to 0 97 high average aerobic dissolved n2o concentration 1 5 mg l was mainly observed with nh4 n concentrations lower than 150 mg l and higher than 300 mg l in the effluent of the sbr additionally the spearman correlation coefficient between dissolved n2o and average aerobic conductivity decrease rate μs cm min was equal to 0 7 and n2o concentration peaks were observed for conductivity decrease rate 1 8 μs cm min the latter indicates that higher emissions occur under high ammonia removal efficiency that can be linked with higher ammonia oxidation rates aor i e due to ph values observed 8 triggering the nh2oh oxidation pathway or higher than average no2 n accumulation triggering nitrifier denitrification pathway domingo félez et al 2014 found that n2o production rates were positively correlated with the extant nitrification rate in a single stage nitritation anammox reactor similarly law et al 2011 identified a linear relationship between aor and n2o emissions in a partial nitritation sbr reactor treating the reject water from anaerobic digestion law et al 2011 suggested that is attributed to higher accumulation of the ammonium oxidation intermediates hydroxylamine nh2oh and nitrosyl radical noh leading to faster n2o formation or to the increased use of electrons reducing nitrite to nitric oxide nitrifier denitrification pathway under low do concentrations high nitrite accumulation has been also linked with elevated n2o emissions and the nitrifier denitrification pathway especially under low do concentrations tallec et al 2006 kampschreur et al 2008 desloover et al 2011 peng et al 2015 massara et al 2017 law et al 2012 for instance peng et al 2017 and kampschreur et al 2009 in a nitritation denitritation sbr and a full scale single stage nitritation anammox reactor respectively identified linear relationship between nitrite accumulation and n2o emissions at do levels below 1 5 mg l similarly tallec et al 2006 in a nitrifying activated sludge observed eightfold increase of n2o emissions with the addition of nitrite pulses 10 mg l at do equal to 1 mg l therefore both hydroxylamine oxidation and the nitrifier denitrification are possible during aeration in the investigated sbr the average dissolved n2o concentration during the aerobic phase of different cycles varied significantly in relation to the average do concentration fig 6 b shows that the dissolved n2o concentration peaks coincided with average do concentrations less than 0 9 1 mg l the spearman correlation coefficient between dissolved n2o and do concentrations was equal to 0 7 the coloured points in the figure represent the orp at the end of the aerobic phase orp is higher than 40 mv in the majority of the cycles with average aerobic dissolved n2o concentration less than 1 mg l only cycles without dissolved n2o accumulation from the previous anoxic phase are shown in the graph stenström et al 2014 showed decreasing do concentrations lower than 1 1 5 mg l are linked with higher nitrite accumulation and are positively correlated with n2o emissions during nitrification in a full scale predenitrification nitrification sbr treating anaerobic supernatant similarly pijuan et al 2014 reported an increase of n2o emissions in a nitritation reactor with the reduction of do from 4 to 1 mg l during the monitoring period blowers operated at maximum flow rate therefore the presence of residual biodegradable cod concentration in the aerobic is expected to decrease do concentration similarly higher influent nh4 loads or higher ammonia oxidation rates that can also result in increased no2 accumulation can impact the do concentration in the system the dissolved n2o concentration can be affected by a combination of variables therefore it cannot be deduced that the decreased do is the sole contributing factor triggering the increased n2o generation observed 3 6 impact of accumulated n2o in the end of anoxic and anaerobic phase several parameters have been reported to affect the n2o accumulation under anoxic conditions such as the inhibition of the nitrous oxide reductase nos by free nitrous acid fna or high accumulation of no2 the electron competition between electron acceptors and the type of carbon source itokawa et al 2001 pan et al 2013 zhou et al 2008 zhu and chen 2011 additionally low values of cod n can result in incomplete denitritation and therefore n2o accumulation via the heterotrophic denitrification pathway during the anoxic phase of the sbr accumulated n2o in the end of the anoxic phase is stripped in the subsequent cycle increasing the n2o emissions caranto et al 2016 have recently showed that n2o can be the main product of anaerobic nh2oh oxidation catalysed by the cytochrome p460 in n europaea the latter can be an evidence of the biological n2o generation under limited do and high nh3 concentrations both conditions occurring in the target system in the during the transition from aerobic to anoxic phases when n2o accumulation rapidly increases in this study the average soluble cod concentration in the fermentation liquid was equal to 13082 mg cod l over the monitoring period table 1 overall in 27 of the examined cycles the n2o was completely consumed by the end of the anoxic phase zhu and chen 2011 showed that the use of sludge alkaline fermentation liquid as carbon source in an anaerobic aerobic system treating high strength stream can reduce the n2o production by up to 68 7 compared to alternative carbon sources i e acetic acid on the other hand li et al 2013a in a process utilizing pha as internal carbon source observed higher n2o production and reduction rates at higher influent cod concentrations linked with higher anaerobic pha synthesis ranging from 100 to 500 mg l the higher n2o production rates were attributed to the accumulated no2 inhibiting the n2o reduction the dissolved n2o concentration in the anoxic phase exceeded the calibration limit of the sensors only cycles in which nitrite knee was observed and n2o reduced to values lower than 2 6 mg l could be investigated therefore the effect on no2 in anoxic n2o generation could not be studied however studies have shown that elevated no2 concentrations during denitrification can reduce the denitrification rate and increase the n2o accumulation schulthess et al 1995 the electron competition between nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductace nos is intensified under high no2 concentrations nos is less competitive under limitation of electron donor and this will result in n2o accumulation pan et al 2013 ren et al 2019 based on the profiles shown in fig 5 n2o was always consumed after the depletion of no2 during denitritation specifically dissolved n2o concentration decreased after the nitrite knee gabarró et al 2014 studied a partial nitritation reactor treating landfill leachate and operated under alternating aerobic anoxic conditions to allow heterotrophic denitritation the authors demonstrated that significant n2o accumulation was observed during anoxic periods no2 denitrification rate was higher under both biodegradable cod limiting conditions and after acetate addition compared to n2o reduction n2o reduction rate was maximum after no2 removal similar to what was observed in this study in denitrifying phosphorus removal processes li et al 2013 a b showed that the n2o accumulation can be higher compared to conventional denitrification the authors suggested that in the electron competition between denitrifying enzymes and pha n2o reductase is less competitive on the other hand ribera guardia et al 2016 investigated the electron competition during denitrification pha as the sole carbon source of enriched dpao and dgao biomass and found that higher n2o accumulation in the latter culture additionally the last step of denitrification was inhibited in dgao cultures n2o accumulation up to 84 of the n reduced under high levels of no2 15 mgn gvss whereas n2o consumption in dpao biomass was not affected wang et al 2015 demonstrated that during denitrifying phosphorus removal mitigation of no2 accumulation is possible via continuous dosage of phosphate and nitrate wang et al 2011 showed that optimisation of the synthesis of pha during the anaerobic phase can mitigate the n2o production during the anoxic phase leading to complete denitrification in the system n2o emissions and dissolved n2o concentration in the aerobic phase is strongly related with incomplete denitritation in the previous cycle in 26 of the cycles with incomplete denitritation the n2o concentration did not decrease below 2 mg l in the anaerobic phase and therefore the stripping of accumulated n2o in the subsequent aerobic phase was substantial fig 7 a shows representative profiles of the dissolved n2o concentration and the n2o emissions based on different initial concentrations of n2o in the beginning of the aerobic phase the profiles of the orp do and ph are comparable in the preseted cycles fig 7 b in cycle b 0 56 kgn of n2o were emitted during the aerobic phase wheareas in cycle a n2o emissions are equal to 0 33 kgn given the duration of these cycles is not equal only 220 min were considered the initial dissolved n2o concentration in cycles a and b is equal to 0 27 and 2 6 mg l respectively the n2o emissions increased significantly due to the accumulated n2o at the beginning of the previous anoxic phase that was stripped at the beginning of aeration overall in 72 of the cycles the dissolved n2o concentration at the beginning of the anaerobic phase was higher than 0 3 mg l in cycles with dissolved n2o concentration higher than 0 3 mg l at the beginning of the anaerobic phase the change in dissolved n2o concentration during the anaerobic phase was highly correlated with the orp at the beginning of the anaerobic phase additionally the spearman correlation coefficient between the magnitude of the orp reduction and magnitude of the dissolved n2o reduction was equal to 0 7 fig 8 shows the boxplots of dissolved n2o reduction in relation to initial anaerobic orp and orp change for two cases i negligible dissolved n2o change mainly due to influent dilution or anaerobic dissolved n2o concentration 2 6 mg l and ii occasions with n2o reduction during the anaerobic phase in fig 8 a only occassions with orp decrease higher than 50 mv are shown the presence of nitrites in the bulk liquid during the anaerobic phase affected the orp no2 n depletion in the bulk liquid resulted in a sharp nitrite knee in the orp profile similar to the one observed during the anoxic phase therefore higher orp change was expected in cycles with no2 n depletion and n2o consumption during the anaerobic phase anaerobic phase term is used to describe the first operational phase of the sbr fig 1 within each cycle and might not represent the actual conditions in the reactor for instance orp 80 mv in the anaerobic phase of the sbr indicates anoxic conditions due to residual no2 n concentration from the previous anoxic phase of the reactor 3 7 prediction and control of n2o accumulation in the anoxic and anaerobic phases as discussed in section 3 6 the behaviour of orp was significantly related with the behaviour of no2 and consequentially of the dissolved n2o concentration during the anaerobic phase therefore in the ansvm model features related with the orp profile were mainly used table 2 similarly there was a strong link with the orp behaviour and the nitrite knee with the n2o accumulation during the anoxic phase the features considered in anoxsvm model are shown in table 2 the classification matrices for train and test datasets of the ansvm and anoxsvm models are presented in table 3 the average classification accuracy for the anoxsvm model was equal to 99 and 97 for the test and validation datasets similar results were obtained for the anaerobic phase with 95 and 98 accuracy in the train and test datasets respectively jaramillo et al 2018 developed an svm classifier to estimate online the end of partial nitrification in a laboratory aerobic anoxic sbr based on features extracted from ph and do sensors over time windows resulting in 7 52 reduction in the operational time in this study the main focus was to estimate offline the behaviour of n2o emissions based on historical batch data the results from this study indicate that orp and ph sensor data can be used to detect the consumption of n2o during the nitritation nitrification in sbr reactors the results show that knowledge based feature extraction and svm classification could help in explaining the behaviour of the system and potentially optimise the control to consider the consumption of accumulated n2o i e in this system the denitritation can be stopped after the local maximum of the orp rate after the nitrite knee in all the cycles investigated fig 9 a and b illustrate the predicted and measured n2o concentration at the end of the anaerobic phase ansvr model the svr parameters were optimised based on the root mean square error using the train dataset rmse of the svr model was equal to 0 11 and 0 1 mg n2o n l for the train and test datasets respectively r squared equal to 0 85 and 0 75 respectively as shown in fig 9 b the simulation results follow the behaviour of the actual dissolved n2o concentrations observed one of the major factors affecting the performance is the limited number of data points but the prediction is still accurate 3 8 prediction of the n2o concentration in aerobic phase the input features are shown in table 4 and were selected based on the identified influential variables the n2o predicted values of the ansvr model were used anaerp the procedure followed for the selection of model parameters was similar to the respective one followed for the anaerobic phase additionally ansvr test dataset cycles were identified and used in aersvr test dataset a the model was also applied in anaerb cycles test dataset b fig 10 a shows the predicted and measured average aerobic n2o concentration for the trained and test datasets rmse of the svr model was equal to 0 06 and 0 11 mg n2o n l for the train dataset and test dataset a respectively whereas the r squared was equal to 0 94 and 0 82 fig 10 a and b the rmse of the predicted values for the test dataset b was equal to 0 29 mg n2o n l and the r squared was equal to 0 72 fig 10 a the aersvr model underpredicted the average dissolved n2o concentration of test b dataset this is expected given that in test b dataset cycles the initial aerobic n2o accumulation exceeds the sensor calibration limit therefore on many occasions the initial aerobic n2o accumulation was also underestimated section 2 2 1 anaerb cycles an example is shown if fig 11 in cycle a the average dissolved n2o concentration calculated as discussed in section 2 2 1 for anaerb cycles is equal to 1 33 mg l the aersvr model predicted 0 87 mg l underestimating the actual concentration considering initial accumulation equal to 0 6 mg l in cycle b the aersvr model predicted n2o concentration equal to 0 61 mg l considering initial accumulation equal to 0 6 the observed average dissolved n2o concentration after the local minimum was equal to 0 6 mg l the results show that under the investigated operational conditions the framework shown in fig 2 can provide a good estimation of the real dissolved n2o behaviour and concentration observed during the different phases of sbr operation instabilities in the performance of machine learning models due to changes in the operational conditions in wastewater bioreactors have been reported in the literature shi and xu 2018 therefore long term datasets and investigation of different patterns and dependencies should be investigated before model construction 3 9 mitigation strategy during aerobic phases elevated average dissolved n2o concentration was linked with do less than 1 mg l and increased conductivity decrease rates conductivity values represent nh4 n concentration values in the reactor therefore cycles with increased conductivity decrease rate indicate higher nh4 n removal efficiency and no2 n accumulation dissolved n2o concentrations lower than 0 6 mg l were identified in cycles with average do concentration equal to 1 36 mg l and conductivity decrease rate 1 8 μs cm min increasing the reactor do concentration to values higher than 1 3 mg l can result in decreased aerobic n2o generation law et al 2012 however with the current anaerobic supernatant feeding strategy blowers operate at maximum flowrate so it is not possible to increase the aeration in the system on the other hand the implementation of a step feeding strategy could foster the reduction of n2o emissions thanks to the lower nh4 n and free ammonia fa concentration at the beginning of the cycle which has been recognized as a triggering factor for n2o production desloover et al 2012 conductivity at the end of the cycle can act as surrogate to estimate the effluent nh4 n concentration of the reactor and optimise the anaerobic supernatant feeding load consequently the aerobic initial nh4 n concentration could be controlled to avoid either fa accumulation or high aor with subsequent n2o generation additionally frequent alternation of aerobic anoxic phases can be introduced in order to avoid high nitrite accumulation the impact of nitrite concentration on n2o production can be also minimized by ensuring adequate do levels within the reactor to inhibit the nitrifiers denitrification pathway blum et al 2018 law et al 2013 rodriguez caballero et al 2015 reported that in a full scale sbr treating municipal wastewater intermittent aeration alternation between 20 and 30 min oxic and anoxic led to a minimisation of n2o compared to long oxic periods that enhanced n2o emission the authors related this behaviour to the presence of shorter aeration times with subsequently lower nitrite accumulation and n2o production in addition su et al 2019 reported that slightly acidic or neutral ph in nitritation reactors at values that do not inhibit microbial activity can decrease n2o generation by up to seven times based on the ph profiles observed in this study regulation of aerobic alkalinity consumption phase duration can be also considered to control the ph at lower levels the developed models can be used to estimate rapidly and precisely the hard to measure n2o concentrations during aeration and detect n2o accumulation in non aerated phases additionally it can alert operators about cycles with anoxic and anaerobic n2o accumulation and elevated aerobic n2o concentrations that require modifications to the system operation the anoxsvm model can predict if n2o is consumed in anoxic phases or if anoxic duration should be extended thus additional provision of fermentation liquid can be performed to promote n2o consumption through denitritation when after 70 90 min the anoxic svm model still indicates incomplete denitritation this study provides evidence on the relationship of do orp and conductivity and ph with the dissolved n2o concentration in terms of correlation coefficients behaviour and thresholds that indicate specific ranges of n2o accumulation these findings together with the models developed in this study can be the basis for the development of intelligent control algorithms to integrate emissions control in sidestream sbr reactors performing nitritation partial nitritation or other systems similar to scena moreover features based on orp ph do and conductivity measurements in wastewater sbr processes that can be used to predict dissolved n2o concentrations have been identified the developed framework can be also tested in continuous processes for the data driven prediction of n2o emissions 4 conclusions knowledge discovery and data mining techniques were employed to extract useful information about the dynamic behaviour of n2o and to predict the behaviour of dissolved n2o concentration in a full scale sbr reactor treating the anaerobic supernatant the main conclusions are summarized as follows the n2o emissions in scena process varies from 1 3 to 19 of nh4 n load therefore they can contribute considerably to the operational carbon footprint of the process 90 on average average aerobic dissolved n2o concentration could significantly vary under similar influent loads do ph and removal efficiencies extracting information from the dynamic in cycle behaviour of the variables monitored in the system is a significant step towards understanding n2o behaviour aerobic dissolved n2o concentration peaks 1 mg l were observed in cycles with average do concentrations less than 0 9 1 mg l and orp concentration at the end of the aerobic phase less than 40 mv conductivity was correlated with the reactor nh4 n concentration 0 97 n2o peaks were also observed in cycles with elevated decrease of conductivity during aeration step feeding control of initial nh4 n concentrations and control of ph via the regulation of aerobic phase duration can mitigate the n2o peaks observed in this study the accumulated n2o at the end of the sbr anoxic phase was stripped in the subsequent aerobic phase and had a significant impact on the amount of n2o emitted the accumulated n2o was consumed rapidly after nitrite knee that was linked with the nitrite depletion the anoxsvm model can be used to detect if anoxic duration should be extended or additional fermentation liquid provided to enhance n2o consumption in anoxic phases this study shows that low cost sensors conventionally used to monitor sbr systems i e ph do orp have good capabilities to predict the dissolved n2o behaviour and concentrations when couple with knowledge discovery techniques the aersvr model showed reliable estimations of the aerobic n2o concentration and can provide guidance to wwtps operators on whether n2o levels are acceptable or mitigation actions are required declaration of competing interest the authors declare
