3230,a quantitative estimation of the sustainability of groundwater resources is a challenge for water supply in most regions of the world sustainability can be estimated through numerical simulation but uncertainty of models somehow limits the reliability of models predictions to overcome this limitation we explore how parametric and predictive uncertainties is reduced by adding complementary groundwater and surface water dynamics data to a lumped parameter model this is illustrated with the example of a mediterranean karst hydrosystem pumped at high flow rate 1 m3 s 1 to supply water to about 350 000 habitants a lumped parameter model was set up to simulate spring discharge water table levels and surface water discharge measured within this karst hydrosystem over a 40 year period then a parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification based on groundwater discharge water table levels and surface water discharge observations was conducted with a bayesian approach our study illustrates how the consideration of complementary hydrological data allows reducing parametric and predictive uncertainty and improving model performance the model is then applied to assess the impact of an increasing groundwater abstraction according to different prospective scenarios with a focus on the storage and dynamic of flux between the different compartments of the karst hydrosystem based on simulation results and related predictive uncertainty a groundwater abstraction threshold which must not be exceeded for a sustainable management of the groundwater resource is determined data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the increasing water supply the need for karst groundwater has grown in particular in the mediterranean area sivelle et al 2021 in this context understanding and predicting the influence of increased groundwater abstraction on the functioning and storage of karst hydrosystem is an important issue in order to correctly describe and predict karst hydrosystem behavior at catchment scale groundwater gw and surface water sw must be considered as a same entity and thus as a unique water resource winter 1999 sophocleous 2002 bailly comte et al 2009 indeed intensive water abstraction and or contamination of groundwater is likely to affect surface water and inversely because of their high interaction and interrelationship bailly comte et al 2009 during extreme events the addition of both karst groundwater and surface water discharge can also be at the origin of floods and flashfloods e g lópez chicano et al 2002 pinault et al 2005 bonacci et al 2006 najib et al 2008 naughton et al 2012 jourde et al 2014 these interactions and relationships between gw and sw have been studied mainly over short time scales flood event scale with the help of hydrodynamic time series analysis or hydrological modeling i e jourde et al 2007 bailly comte et al 2009 bailly comte et al 2012 darras et al 2017 due to the heterogenous nature of karst aquifers distributed modeling cannot be easily implemented and calibrated because of difficulties in obtaining the necessary input data hartmann et al 2014 furthermore times series generally consist in discharge measurements at the main outlets of the catchment for this reason modeling the hydrodynamics of such complex karst systems generally consists in the simulation of rainfall discharge relationship with lumped parameter models bittner et al 2018 dubois et al 2020 labat et al 1999 ladouche et al 2014 long and derickson 1999 mazzilli 2011 modeling can further be used to describe the global responses of a karst system to either climatic or anthropogenic forcing in terms of water table or spring discharge fluctuations sivelle et al 2021 indeed it may be of major importance to assess the consequences of intensive groundwater exploitation especially in mediterranean region vallejos et al 2015 however parameters involved in hydrological models are generally obtained by history matching against observations such as spring discharge and sometimes water table level the invers problem in hydrology is generally ill posed because the solution does not exist uniquely and model output varies non continuously as the unput data changes smoothly anderman and hill 1997 carrera et al 2005 zhou et al 2014 which may lead to non uniqueness non existence and non steadiness of the solution zhou et al 2014 in this case an infinite number of parameter sets can calibrate the model equally well to overcome this issue some improvements of inversion tools and parameters dimension reduction have been developed for example the active subspace method was recently proposed to reduce the dimension of complex hydrological models bittner et al 2020 teixeira parente et al 2019 the use of multi objective calibration framework have also been extended by considering autocorrelation of the discharge time series in addition to the classical least mean square errors moussu et al 2011 the use of additional observations such as water quality data hartmann et al 2017 electrical conductivity chang et al 2021 or stream aquifer mixing ratio cousquer et al 2018 alleviate the ill posedness of the inverse problem and lead to a more robust model and a reduction of parametric uncertainty in this study we propose to quantify both parametric and predictive uncertainty reduction of a lumped parameter model used for the hydrological modelling of a karst hydrosystems this model designed with the karstmod modelling platform mazzilli et al 2019 allows accounting for different reservoirs representative of distinct karst compartments epikarst matrix conduit to reduce uncertainty we consider an additional independent hydrological observation in complement to spring discharge and water table level i e the outflow from the epikarstic compartment in the parameter estimation procedure realized with a bayesian approach this multi objective calibration improves the robustness of the model by reducing uncertainty the model is used afterward to assess an abstraction flow rate threshold and estimate a sustainable management based on several water resource management scenarios the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the lez mediterranean karst system and the groundwater management of the aquifer as well as the data considered in this study in section 3 we present the structure of the lumped parameter model used to simulate karst spring discharge the parameter estimation procedure and the methodology adopted to assess the influence of various management options on the functioning of the karst hydrosystem section 4 is devoted to the analysis of the changes in the parametric uncertainty when complementary observation data water table data and surface discharge observation are added to the objective function then we discuss the consequences of various groundwater abstraction scenarios on the groundwater resource internal fluxes between compartments of the karst hydrodystem and discharge at the karst spring based on simulation results and related predictive uncertainty a groundwater abstraction threshold that must not be exceeded for a sustainable management of the groundwater resource is finally determined section 5 presents the conclusions 2 study site the lez karst hydrosystem the mediterranean karst hydrosystem considered in this study is located in the south of france and is encompassed between the hercynian basement of the cévennes to the north and the mediterranean sea to the south with a main spring called lez spring the karst aquifer supplies water to the city of montpellier southern france since the end of the xixth century nowadays these are about 10 000 m3 day 1 of drinking water which are provided to about 350 000 habitants of the metropolitan area of montpellier city the particularity of this aquifer lies in the management of the water resource which consists in pumping groundwater directly within the karst conduit at a higher rate 1000 l s 1 than the low water spring discharge 370 l s 1 jourde et al 2011 this management referred to as active management allows to extract part of the stored and naturally renewable groundwater but generates large drawdown 25 m below the overflow level of the karst spring during low flow periods the recharge area of the lez spring catchment is estimated to be about 150 km2 corresponding mostly to the surface area where the aquifer limestone directly outcrops mazzilli 2011 the exact area of the aquifer that feeds the lez spring referred to as the hydrogeological basin fig 1 a and b modified after drogue 1964 is not precisely known but is estimated to be around 250 km2 leonardi et al 2011 the intense mediterranean events in autumn are the main contributors to the annual recharge annual rainfall occurs principally from september to december and to a lesser extent from march to may dausse et al 2019 the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 600 mm to 1500 mm the lez aquifer is mainly composed of upper jurassic and early cretaceous limestone the aquifer is overlain by the lower jurrassic marls and is locally covered by a succession of early cretaceous marls and marly limestone the aquifer shows a high degree of karstification developed from the middle cretaceous to the current period leonardi et al 2011 the deep karstification at the origin of karst conduits and channels at depth is attributed to the messinian salinity crisis about 5 5 my ago when the mediterranean sea level dropped about 1500 m due to the closing of the gibraltar straights audra et al 2004 clauzon et al 2005 the aquifer is divided into several ne sw normal faults related to the pyrenean orogeny eocene and later impacted by the oligocene extension phase séranne et al 1995 benedicto et al 1999 the lez spring which was a perennial spring under natural conditions before high flow rate pumping feeds the lez river besides this river the terrieu and the lirou intermittent streams drain the upper part of the karst system and flow across the hydrosystem mainly during intense rainfall events the hydrogeological karst catchment encompasses the hydrological basin of the lez river at the entrance of montpellier lavalette gauging station the area of which being about 130 km2 fig 1 2 1 observations 2 1 1 discharge data and water table measurements at the lez spring we considered discharge and water table time series at the lez spring as well as discharge of the lez river at the lavalette gauging station fig 1 over the 1982 2020 period discharge measured at the lavalette gauging station corresponds to discharge at the outlet of the hydrological watershed that drains the lez river and its main tributaries lirou and terrieu streams which flow essentially after intense mediterranean rainfall events then surface flow composed of secondary outflows of epikarstic intermittent springs from the karst aquifer can be estimated as follows 1 q surface q lavalette q lez where qsurface l3 t 1 is the estimated discharge of the secondary outlets i e contribution of karst overflow through the lirou and terrieu streams qlavalette l3 t 1 is the lez river discharge recorded at the lavalette gauging station fig 1 and qlez l3 t 1 is the lez spring discharge fig 1 2 1 2 meteorological observations precipitations has been recorded with rain gauges at 4 stations located over the lez hydrosystem or in its surrounding fig 1 global rainfall over the recharge area where jurrasic and cretaceous karst limestone formations overly was interpolated with thiessen polygons due to some gaps in precipitation time series at various of these monitoring stations the weight of each station has been calculated over time to suit data availability effective evaporation et has been measured with a flux tower in p4 fig 1 at the cefe experimental station of puechabon limousin et al 2009 build over quercus ilex forest with a shallow soil characteristic of jurassic limestone epikarst which comprises a high proportion of stone and rocks in the top layers 75 maximum available water content is around 120 mm olioso et al 2019 and mean annual evapotranspiration corresponds to 44 of precipitation with a high inter annual variability depending on precipitation distribution limousin et al 2009 at this site the geology and the vegetation are like the one over the lez spring recharge catchment as this experimental station is located about 13 km from the hydrogeological basin boundary and spatial variation of et in this area is very low compared to its daily variation limousin et al 2009 we considered that measurements at this site provide a good proxy of et over the lez spring karst catchment 2 2 groundwater management of the lez karst aquifer the lez spring has supplied drinking water to montpellier city and its surroundings since 1854 initially only part of the natural discharge of the spring was used with an abstraction flow rate that was about 0 4 m3 s 1 due to the geometrical properties diameter and slope of the tapping conduit located at about 65 m a s l one meter below the overflow level of the spring from 1968 to 1982 water was extracted by pumping directly within the spring pool with a flow rate up to about 0 8 m3 s 1 which generated a water table decrease to 6 50 m below the overflow level of the spring during low flow conditions during this period the pumping rate was sufficient to satisfy water needs except during low flow conditions june july august and september to overcome this issue 4 boreholes were drilled in 1982 400 m upstream from the lez spring to intercept the main karst conduit that feeds this spring groundwater is currently tapped by three pumping units located at 45 m below the overflow level of the spring and consists of two submerged pumps connected in series and operating at variable speed with an output flowrate of 600 to 1 000 l s 1 the mean pumping rate being of about 1 08 m3 s 1 over the 1982 2021 period the active management performed since 1982 allows providing a minimum discharge rate to the lez river for ecological purposes 160 l s 1 then 230 l s 1 after 2018 but also satisfying the increase of water need during the dry months fig 2 3 methods the data used in the model were precipitation obtained by interpolation from thiessen method from 4 stations presented fig 1 effective evaporation et measured at the cefe experimental station of puechabon p4 fig 1 water table level pumping flow rate and discharge measured at the lez spring as well as surface discharge qs measured at lavalette station at daily resolution from 01 01 1982 to 12 31 2020 we set up a warm up period from 01 01 1982 to 12 31 1986 to avoid the influence of initial condition on both model calibration and validation so that the model appropriately captures the hydrological variability of the karst hydrosystem the calibration period is set up from 01 01 1996 to 12 31 2005 which corresponds to a period of highly contrasted hydrometeorological conditions the validation period covers both the 01 01 1987 12 31 1995 and the 01 01 2006 12 31 2020 periods 3 1 model development and structure several numerical models have already been developed to study the lez aquifer s hydrodynamics with a view to groundwater exploitation reservoirs guilbot 1975 thiery et al 1983 fleury et al 2009 mazzilli 2011 or to simulate several scenarios of pumping under present and future climatic conditions maréchal et al 2018 however the studies did not consider surface water discharge from secondary outlets and intermittent springs in the modeling water table levels and discharge at the lez spring were simulated with the karstmod modeling platform mazzilli et al 2019 which is a conceptual reservoir model dedicated to karst flow simulation this code is a modular bucket style conceptual model where water fluxes cross interconnected reservoirs to quantify them over chosen time steps the structure of the lumped reservoir model fig 2 used to simulate discharge and hydrodynamics at the lez spring comprises three reservoirs that can be considered as representative of different hydrological compartments this configuration was chosen to consider the behavior of epikarst matrix and conduit i e the epikarst compartment e the matrix compartment m and the karst conduits compartment c qloss corresponds to the surface discharge from the epikarst compartment qpump represents the pumping discharge from karst conduits compartment c where water table level z is estimated from water level in c qs corresponds to spring discharge each reservoir dynamic is driven by mass balance equations provided by mazzilli et al 2017 and detailed in appendix 3 2 parameter estimation in hydrogeology most models are mathematically ill posed because the solution does not exist uniquely and model output varies non continuously as the input data changes smoothly which means that there are issues for uniqueness identifiability and stability of the problem solution ebel et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 to tend toward a well posed problem one can use various data types to constrain model solutions with a mathematical parameter space exploration we propose to accomplish this through a stochastic approach based on bayesian assumption with a sufficiently large prior range of parameters the model contains fourteen parameters to be estimated table 1 the parameter estimation method considered to explore parameter space to reduce the gap between observed and simulated variables spring discharge water table level and surface water discharge has been developed under a r script first the variance based sobol sensitivity indexes sobol 2001 saltelli et al 2004 are calculated for each parameter following the sobol procedure saltelli 2002 these sensitivity indexes are related to the decomposition of the variance of model output into terms that are due either to each parameter i taken singularly first order indexes or to interactions between parameters global sensitivity index the sensitivity of each parameter is described by the first order sensitivity index which is the contribution of a single model parameter to the model output variance sobol 2001 the sensitivity index has been calculated for a number of 105 parameter sets this procedure allows identifying parameters that have a low effect on solution a sensitivity threshold of 0 001 have been selected in order to set a fixed value for parameters that have a very low sensitivity on the model following this procedure m 0 and c 0 parameter have been set table 1 other fixed parameter values r a and z 0 have been chosen on expert knowledges based on field measurements the reduction of the number of parameters to be estimated allows limiting the non uniqueness of the solution by diminishing both over parametrization and dimension of the parameter space range of parameters have been chosen sufficiently large to properly cover the solution space monte carlo procedure with a latin hypercube uniform sampling of the parameter space has been set sufficiently large to explore parameter space a sampling size of 5 105 parameter set has been generated parameter estimation is then performed based on an objective function ϕ which account for three distinct nash sutcliff efficiency nse values related to either spring discharge water table level or surface water discharge 2 ϕ l 1 m k 1 k l i 1 n k l ω k l 1 r k l 2 o b s obs 2 k l where r k l is the residual value between simulation and observation m is the number of data types spring discharge water table level and surface water discharge k l is the number of observation points for the i th data type 1 in this case and n k l is the number of observation records for the k th observation point of the l th data type n k l 1 when considering steady state values the weighing factor of each observation is 1 m every observation of each data type is then well balanced in the pre calibration objective function in the remaining of the paper the objective function considering spring discharge only will be referred to as ϕtot 1 ϕqgw the objective function considering spring discharge and water table level as ϕtot 0 5 ϕqgw 0 5 ϕqz and the objective function considering spring discharge water table level and surface discharge as ϕtot 1 3 ϕqgw 1 3 ϕqz 1 3 ϕqsw third each parameter set that equally calibrates the model with a minimum value of the objective function ϕ of 0 6 is collected 3 3 investigating future groundwater management scenarios different management scenarios have been simulated accounting for the posterior parameters set that equally calibrate the model these simulations permitted to assess the effects of various management options distinct pumping flowrate on the functioning of the karst hydrosystem under the current climate condition similar p and et we estimated the mean annual discharge and water table at the lez spring as well as the mean annual surface discharge versus the annual groundwater abstraction this has been performed while considering an increase in pumping flowrate with an increment of 0 1 m3 s 1 from 0 to 2 m3 s 1 over the same period as the calibration period 1996 2005 in order to consider highly contrasted hydrometeorological conditions predictive uncertainty was estimated from the simulations distribution that encompass all posterior parameter sets satisfying the objective function such hydrological modeling of alternative management scenarios can help us to assess the tipping point between sustainable and unsustainable groundwater management and therefore the corresponding pumping flowrate that must not be exceeded 4 results and discussion we present results of the parameter estimation procedure and uncertainty analysis then analyze the hydrological response of the hydrosystem to various groundwater withdrawal scenarios observed simulated and associated uncertainty in the calibration period are presented in fig 3 for spring discharge water table level and surface discharge table 2 shows the number of posterior parameters set that satisfied the objective function threshold of 0 6 and the best objective function obtained as a function of observation variables considered for parameter estimation we can observe that when the objective function is enriched with a new type of data the number of parameters sets satisfying the ϕ threshold of 0 6 decreases and the best value of the objective function ϕ nse in this case also decreases both for calibration and validation period it allows to gain in stability of the results and to minimize the problem of over fitting adding surface water discharge observations to the parameter estimation process allows to improve equifinality issue by reducing the number of parameter sets that equally calibrate the model and thus the parametric uncertainty the number of parameter sets decreases from 6424 when accounting for spring discharge q s only to 52 when accounting also for both water table levels at the spring and surface discharge table 1 in this way we reduce parameters set that equally satisfied the objectif function from 1 3 to 0 01 over the 5 105 tested parameter sets reducing equifinality issues and parametric uncertainty constitute an important preliminary step to improve the confidence in model results before studying alternative management scenarios and their consequences on the sustainability of groundwater resources influence of observation type posterior parameter density are presented fig 4 when the objective function accounts for both the discharge and the water table level there are very few improvements in parameter uncertainty fig 4 except for the estimation of compartment c porosity parameter ω c on the contrary when the objective function accounts for the discharge and water table level at the spring but also for the surface discharge observation uncertainty is notably reduced for almost all parameters fig 4 especially those which control surface water discharge k loss e min and fluxes between various hydrological compartments i e the epikarst compartment the matrix compartment and the karst conduit compartment k em a e m k mc aec amc results of the simulations for prospective pumping scenarios fig 5 indicate that the mean annual discharge linearly decreases as a function of the pumping flowrate and becomes null when the pumping flowrate reaches the mean inter annual spring discharge of 2 m3 s 1 theoretically pumping flowrate should be sustainable until the groundwater abstraction reaches this mean annual discharge value however when we analyze the mean annual water table in the karst conduit compartment fig 5 it decreases slowly and drops abruptly when the mean annual pumping rate reaches about 1 5 m3 s 1 to 1 7 m3 s 1 depending on predictive uncertainty which correspond to a water table level of about 45 to 55 m a s l which is 10 to 20 m under spring level beyond this value the table level drops indicate that the recharge is no longer sufficient to recover the spring water table level which can lead to several years without flow at the spring and a water table level far under the current pump level mean matrix to conduit flow decreases from the very beginning of pumping and further decreases when the pumping flowrate reaches the threshold which is between 1 5 m3 s 1 to 1 7 m3 s 1 which contributes to the water level drop in the conduit compartment fig 5 a median water table level of about 50 m a s l correspond to a pumping flow rate value around 1 6 m3 s 1 can thus be considered as a tipping point gobble 2020 indicating the change from a sustainable to an unsustainable management of the groundwater resource predictive uncertainty is then evaluated for each objective function to estimate the reliability of the prediction and to quantify the interest off adding water table level and surface discharge observations to the parameter estimation step fig 6 predictive uncertainty has been quantified by using every estimated parameter set for each objective function predictive uncertainty was estimated by a density function considering all parameter sets satisfying the objective function this allowed to consider the uncertainty associated to the predictive simulation under alternative management scenarios for each objective function this uncertainty is particularly significant for values of mean annual pumping discharge around and higher than the threshold range of 1 5 m3 s 1 to 1 7 m3 s 1 which defines the tipping point and corresponds to a median water table level of 50 m a s l however the mean annual pumping discharge distribution are noticeably different when considering each of the 3 objectives function φtot for a tipping point occurring for a selected water table level of 50 m a s l the median tipping point pumping discharge value is of 1 71 1 66 and 1 69 m2 s 1 for objective function with qgw qgw φqz and qgw φqz φqsw respectively with a standard deviation for those distribution of 0 083 0 05 and 0 033 m2 s 1 these distributions show that the uncertainty on pumping discharges associated to this tipping point is also reduced when the objective function includes complementary data i e water table level alone or both water table level and surface discharge observation fig 6 the median value of these distributions and especially the distribution obtained when the objective function φtot 1 3 φqgw 1 3 φqz 1 3 φqsw is considered in the calibration give a better estimate of the pumping flow rate threshold which defines the tipping point one limitation of the proposed method is that beyond the tipping point pumping flowrate threshold the quantified predictive uncertainty increases fig 6 this can be explained by a lack of observations at higher pumping flowrate than the mean pumping flowrate in the parameter estimation however even though the uncertainty is high this unsustainable management would generate water table levels much lower down to 150 m drawdowns than the spring overflow level when groundwater abstraction discharge changes from 1 6 m3 s 1 to 2 m3 s 1 in this case the spring will be dry most of the time as the occurrence of no flow at the lez spring would increase from 80 to 100 when pumping flow rate changes from 1 6 m3 s 1 to 2 m3 s 1 to further understand the change in hydrosystem dynamics under such anthropogenic forcing we performed simulations considering i the mean annual pumping rate of 1 m3 s 1 which corresponds to the current management scheme over the 1982 2020 period then a groundwater abstraction ii slightly below 1 5 m3 s 1 and iii above 1 7 m3 s 1 the pumping flow rate threshold when pumping flowrate overpasses 1 6 m3 s 1 threshold the water table level remains below the overflow level of the springover a very large period spring discharge is null in this case pumped groundwater comes from water stored in the aquifer during wet years i e 1987 1995 1996 cf red boxes fig 7 under the current management with a groundwater abstraction of about 1 m3 s 1 we can observe an overflow at the spring 48 of the time for a pumping flowrate of 1 5 m3 s 1 spring flows 28 of the time and 18 of the time when the pumping flowrate reaches 1 7 m3 s 1 under the current management aquifer recharge is thus sufficient to provide water at the spring every year but becomes insufficient when the pumping flowrate overpasses 1 6 m3 s 1 for example there are four complete years over 9 years with no flow at the spring for a pumping flowrate of 1 7 m3 s 1 fig 7 furthermore when groundwater abstraction overpasses the 1 6 m3 s 1 threshold there is a drastic drop of the water table level much below the authorized drawdown 30 m which corresponds to a piezometry of 35 m for greater drawdowns such as the one observed when the pumping flowrate reaches 1 7 m3 s 1 50 m the hydrodynamic response of the aquifer is unknown and the expected recovery during wet years might be altered 5 summary and conclusion the presented case study shows how the use of complementary hydrological data from different compartments of a karst hydrosystem allows improving the performance of karst hydrological modelling and noticeably reducing both parametric and predictive uncertainties the proposed karst hydrological model simulates spring discharge water table levels and surface discharge these complementary hydrological data are considered for model performance estimate on the basis of distinct objective functions the parameter estimation is performed with a bayesian procedure based on a monte carlo approach considering objectives functions that contain these complementary hydrological data when surface water discharge observations as well as water table levels and discharge observations at the spring are considered in the objective function both parametric and predictive uncertainties are greatly reduced this study also gives insights about the hydrological response of a karst hydrosystem under high anthropogenic pressure increased groundwater abstraction by analyzing the hydrodynamic response to various management options under current climate conditions a groundwater abstraction threshold maximum pumping flow rate that must not be overpassed for a sustainable management of the groundwater resource has been identified this pumping flow rate value can be considered as a tipping point in the functioning of the karst aquifer with unknown consequences on the recovery of the aquifer after successive dry years or droughts indeed we would expect that pumping flowrate corresponding to the mean interannual outflow at the spring 2 m3 s 1 should be possible however the prediction of water table levels and spring discharge shows that recharge is insufficient to recover annual water depletion each year when the pumping flowrate rate exceeds about 1 6 m3 s 1 beyond this pumping flowrate threshold no flow at the spring would be observed 44 of the time and the occurrence of such events would increase significantly for higher pumping flowrate given these results and due to the variability of hydroclimatic conditions that limits the recharge of the aquifer during some years a sustainable management of the groundwater resource will be possible only if the pumping flowrate remains below the pumping flowrate threshold of 1 6 1 7 m3 s 1 evidenced in this study it thus points out the risk of unsustainability of the water resource management especially in case of recurrent dry years this disequilibrium might not only endanger the water supply but also the downstream groundwater dependent ecosystem the proposed methodology which allows reducing hydrologic modeling uncertainty and thus improving simulations results should help stakeholders to take the right decisions for a sustainable management of the karst groundwater resource credit authorship contribution statement yohann cousquer conceptualization

3230,a quantitative estimation of the sustainability of groundwater resources is a challenge for water supply in most regions of the world sustainability can be estimated through numerical simulation but uncertainty of models somehow limits the reliability of models predictions to overcome this limitation we explore how parametric and predictive uncertainties is reduced by adding complementary groundwater and surface water dynamics data to a lumped parameter model this is illustrated with the example of a mediterranean karst hydrosystem pumped at high flow rate 1 m3 s 1 to supply water to about 350 000 habitants a lumped parameter model was set up to simulate spring discharge water table levels and surface water discharge measured within this karst hydrosystem over a 40 year period then a parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification based on groundwater discharge water table levels and surface water discharge observations was conducted with a bayesian approach our study illustrates how the consideration of complementary hydrological data allows reducing parametric and predictive uncertainty and improving model performance the model is then applied to assess the impact of an increasing groundwater abstraction according to different prospective scenarios with a focus on the storage and dynamic of flux between the different compartments of the karst hydrosystem based on simulation results and related predictive uncertainty a groundwater abstraction threshold which must not be exceeded for a sustainable management of the groundwater resource is determined data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the increasing water supply the need for karst groundwater has grown in particular in the mediterranean area sivelle et al 2021 in this context understanding and predicting the influence of increased groundwater abstraction on the functioning and storage of karst hydrosystem is an important issue in order to correctly describe and predict karst hydrosystem behavior at catchment scale groundwater gw and surface water sw must be considered as a same entity and thus as a unique water resource winter 1999 sophocleous 2002 bailly comte et al 2009 indeed intensive water abstraction and or contamination of groundwater is likely to affect surface water and inversely because of their high interaction and interrelationship bailly comte et al 2009 during extreme events the addition of both karst groundwater and surface water discharge can also be at the origin of floods and flashfloods e g lópez chicano et al 2002 pinault et al 2005 bonacci et al 2006 najib et al 2008 naughton et al 2012 jourde et al 2014 these interactions and relationships between gw and sw have been studied mainly over short time scales flood event scale with the help of hydrodynamic time series analysis or hydrological modeling i e jourde et al 2007 bailly comte et al 2009 bailly comte et al 2012 darras et al 2017 due to the heterogenous nature of karst aquifers distributed modeling cannot be easily implemented and calibrated because of difficulties in obtaining the necessary input data hartmann et al 2014 furthermore times series generally consist in discharge measurements at the main outlets of the catchment for this reason modeling the hydrodynamics of such complex karst systems generally consists in the simulation of rainfall discharge relationship with lumped parameter models bittner et al 2018 dubois et al 2020 labat et al 1999 ladouche et al 2014 long and derickson 1999 mazzilli 2011 modeling can further be used to describe the global responses of a karst system to either climatic or anthropogenic forcing in terms of water table or spring discharge fluctuations sivelle et al 2021 indeed it may be of major importance to assess the consequences of intensive groundwater exploitation especially in mediterranean region vallejos et al 2015 however parameters involved in hydrological models are generally obtained by history matching against observations such as spring discharge and sometimes water table level the invers problem in hydrology is generally ill posed because the solution does not exist uniquely and model output varies non continuously as the unput data changes smoothly anderman and hill 1997 carrera et al 2005 zhou et al 2014 which may lead to non uniqueness non existence and non steadiness of the solution zhou et al 2014 in this case an infinite number of parameter sets can calibrate the model equally well to overcome this issue some improvements of inversion tools and parameters dimension reduction have been developed for example the active subspace method was recently proposed to reduce the dimension of complex hydrological models bittner et al 2020 teixeira parente et al 2019 the use of multi objective calibration framework have also been extended by considering autocorrelation of the discharge time series in addition to the classical least mean square errors moussu et al 2011 the use of additional observations such as water quality data hartmann et al 2017 electrical conductivity chang et al 2021 or stream aquifer mixing ratio cousquer et al 2018 alleviate the ill posedness of the inverse problem and lead to a more robust model and a reduction of parametric uncertainty in this study we propose to quantify both parametric and predictive uncertainty reduction of a lumped parameter model used for the hydrological modelling of a karst hydrosystems this model designed with the karstmod modelling platform mazzilli et al 2019 allows accounting for different reservoirs representative of distinct karst compartments epikarst matrix conduit to reduce uncertainty we consider an additional independent hydrological observation in complement to spring discharge and water table level i e the outflow from the epikarstic compartment in the parameter estimation procedure realized with a bayesian approach this multi objective calibration improves the robustness of the model by reducing uncertainty the model is used afterward to assess an abstraction flow rate threshold and estimate a sustainable management based on several water resource management scenarios the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the lez mediterranean karst system and the groundwater management of the aquifer as well as the data considered in this study in section 3 we present the structure of the lumped parameter model used to simulate karst spring discharge the parameter estimation procedure and the methodology adopted to assess the influence of various management options on the functioning of the karst hydrosystem section 4 is devoted to the analysis of the changes in the parametric uncertainty when complementary observation data water table data and surface discharge observation are added to the objective function then we discuss the consequences of various groundwater abstraction scenarios on the groundwater resource internal fluxes between compartments of the karst hydrodystem and discharge at the karst spring based on simulation results and related predictive uncertainty a groundwater abstraction threshold that must not be exceeded for a sustainable management of the groundwater resource is finally determined section 5 presents the conclusions 2 study site the lez karst hydrosystem the mediterranean karst hydrosystem considered in this study is located in the south of france and is encompassed between the hercynian basement of the cévennes to the north and the mediterranean sea to the south with a main spring called lez spring the karst aquifer supplies water to the city of montpellier southern france since the end of the xixth century nowadays these are about 10 000 m3 day 1 of drinking water which are provided to about 350 000 habitants of the metropolitan area of montpellier city the particularity of this aquifer lies in the management of the water resource which consists in pumping groundwater directly within the karst conduit at a higher rate 1000 l s 1 than the low water spring discharge 370 l s 1 jourde et al 2011 this management referred to as active management allows to extract part of the stored and naturally renewable groundwater but generates large drawdown 25 m below the overflow level of the karst spring during low flow periods the recharge area of the lez spring catchment is estimated to be about 150 km2 corresponding mostly to the surface area where the aquifer limestone directly outcrops mazzilli 2011 the exact area of the aquifer that feeds the lez spring referred to as the hydrogeological basin fig 1 a and b modified after drogue 1964 is not precisely known but is estimated to be around 250 km2 leonardi et al 2011 the intense mediterranean events in autumn are the main contributors to the annual recharge annual rainfall occurs principally from september to december and to a lesser extent from march to may dausse et al 2019 the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 600 mm to 1500 mm the lez aquifer is mainly composed of upper jurassic and early cretaceous limestone the aquifer is overlain by the lower jurrassic marls and is locally covered by a succession of early cretaceous marls and marly limestone the aquifer shows a high degree of karstification developed from the middle cretaceous to the current period leonardi et al 2011 the deep karstification at the origin of karst conduits and channels at depth is attributed to the messinian salinity crisis about 5 5 my ago when the mediterranean sea level dropped about 1500 m due to the closing of the gibraltar straights audra et al 2004 clauzon et al 2005 the aquifer is divided into several ne sw normal faults related to the pyrenean orogeny eocene and later impacted by the oligocene extension phase séranne et al 1995 benedicto et al 1999 the lez spring which was a perennial spring under natural conditions before high flow rate pumping feeds the lez river besides this river the terrieu and the lirou intermittent streams drain the upper part of the karst system and flow across the hydrosystem mainly during intense rainfall events the hydrogeological karst catchment encompasses the hydrological basin of the lez river at the entrance of montpellier lavalette gauging station the area of which being about 130 km2 fig 1 2 1 observations 2 1 1 discharge data and water table measurements at the lez spring we considered discharge and water table time series at the lez spring as well as discharge of the lez river at the lavalette gauging station fig 1 over the 1982 2020 period discharge measured at the lavalette gauging station corresponds to discharge at the outlet of the hydrological watershed that drains the lez river and its main tributaries lirou and terrieu streams which flow essentially after intense mediterranean rainfall events then surface flow composed of secondary outflows of epikarstic intermittent springs from the karst aquifer can be estimated as follows 1 q surface q lavalette q lez where qsurface l3 t 1 is the estimated discharge of the secondary outlets i e contribution of karst overflow through the lirou and terrieu streams qlavalette l3 t 1 is the lez river discharge recorded at the lavalette gauging station fig 1 and qlez l3 t 1 is the lez spring discharge fig 1 2 1 2 meteorological observations precipitations has been recorded with rain gauges at 4 stations located over the lez hydrosystem or in its surrounding fig 1 global rainfall over the recharge area where jurrasic and cretaceous karst limestone formations overly was interpolated with thiessen polygons due to some gaps in precipitation time series at various of these monitoring stations the weight of each station has been calculated over time to suit data availability effective evaporation et has been measured with a flux tower in p4 fig 1 at the cefe experimental station of puechabon limousin et al 2009 build over quercus ilex forest with a shallow soil characteristic of jurassic limestone epikarst which comprises a high proportion of stone and rocks in the top layers 75 maximum available water content is around 120 mm olioso et al 2019 and mean annual evapotranspiration corresponds to 44 of precipitation with a high inter annual variability depending on precipitation distribution limousin et al 2009 at this site the geology and the vegetation are like the one over the lez spring recharge catchment as this experimental station is located about 13 km from the hydrogeological basin boundary and spatial variation of et in this area is very low compared to its daily variation limousin et al 2009 we considered that measurements at this site provide a good proxy of et over the lez spring karst catchment 2 2 groundwater management of the lez karst aquifer the lez spring has supplied drinking water to montpellier city and its surroundings since 1854 initially only part of the natural discharge of the spring was used with an abstraction flow rate that was about 0 4 m3 s 1 due to the geometrical properties diameter and slope of the tapping conduit located at about 65 m a s l one meter below the overflow level of the spring from 1968 to 1982 water was extracted by pumping directly within the spring pool with a flow rate up to about 0 8 m3 s 1 which generated a water table decrease to 6 50 m below the overflow level of the spring during low flow conditions during this period the pumping rate was sufficient to satisfy water needs except during low flow conditions june july august and september to overcome this issue 4 boreholes were drilled in 1982 400 m upstream from the lez spring to intercept the main karst conduit that feeds this spring groundwater is currently tapped by three pumping units located at 45 m below the overflow level of the spring and consists of two submerged pumps connected in series and operating at variable speed with an output flowrate of 600 to 1 000 l s 1 the mean pumping rate being of about 1 08 m3 s 1 over the 1982 2021 period the active management performed since 1982 allows providing a minimum discharge rate to the lez river for ecological purposes 160 l s 1 then 230 l s 1 after 2018 but also satisfying the increase of water need during the dry months fig 2 3 methods the data used in the model were precipitation obtained by interpolation from thiessen method from 4 stations presented fig 1 effective evaporation et measured at the cefe experimental station of puechabon p4 fig 1 water table level pumping flow rate and discharge measured at the lez spring as well as surface discharge qs measured at lavalette station at daily resolution from 01 01 1982 to 12 31 2020 we set up a warm up period from 01 01 1982 to 12 31 1986 to avoid the influence of initial condition on both model calibration and validation so that the model appropriately captures the hydrological variability of the karst hydrosystem the calibration period is set up from 01 01 1996 to 12 31 2005 which corresponds to a period of highly contrasted hydrometeorological conditions the validation period covers both the 01 01 1987 12 31 1995 and the 01 01 2006 12 31 2020 periods 3 1 model development and structure several numerical models have already been developed to study the lez aquifer s hydrodynamics with a view to groundwater exploitation reservoirs guilbot 1975 thiery et al 1983 fleury et al 2009 mazzilli 2011 or to simulate several scenarios of pumping under present and future climatic conditions maréchal et al 2018 however the studies did not consider surface water discharge from secondary outlets and intermittent springs in the modeling water table levels and discharge at the lez spring were simulated with the karstmod modeling platform mazzilli et al 2019 which is a conceptual reservoir model dedicated to karst flow simulation this code is a modular bucket style conceptual model where water fluxes cross interconnected reservoirs to quantify them over chosen time steps the structure of the lumped reservoir model fig 2 used to simulate discharge and hydrodynamics at the lez spring comprises three reservoirs that can be considered as representative of different hydrological compartments this configuration was chosen to consider the behavior of epikarst matrix and conduit i e the epikarst compartment e the matrix compartment m and the karst conduits compartment c qloss corresponds to the surface discharge from the epikarst compartment qpump represents the pumping discharge from karst conduits compartment c where water table level z is estimated from water level in c qs corresponds to spring discharge each reservoir dynamic is driven by mass balance equations provided by mazzilli et al 2017 and detailed in appendix 3 2 parameter estimation in hydrogeology most models are mathematically ill posed because the solution does not exist uniquely and model output varies non continuously as the input data changes smoothly which means that there are issues for uniqueness identifiability and stability of the problem solution ebel et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 to tend toward a well posed problem one can use various data types to constrain model solutions with a mathematical parameter space exploration we propose to accomplish this through a stochastic approach based on bayesian assumption with a sufficiently large prior range of parameters the model contains fourteen parameters to be estimated table 1 the parameter estimation method considered to explore parameter space to reduce the gap between observed and simulated variables spring discharge water table level and surface water discharge has been developed under a r script first the variance based sobol sensitivity indexes sobol 2001 saltelli et al 2004 are calculated for each parameter following the sobol procedure saltelli 2002 these sensitivity indexes are related to the decomposition of the variance of model output into terms that are due either to each parameter i taken singularly first order indexes or to interactions between parameters global sensitivity index the sensitivity of each parameter is described by the first order sensitivity index which is the contribution of a single model parameter to the model output variance sobol 2001 the sensitivity index has been calculated for a number of 105 parameter sets this procedure allows identifying parameters that have a low effect on solution a sensitivity threshold of 0 001 have been selected in order to set a fixed value for parameters that have a very low sensitivity on the model following this procedure m 0 and c 0 parameter have been set table 1 other fixed parameter values r a and z 0 have been chosen on expert knowledges based on field measurements the reduction of the number of parameters to be estimated allows limiting the non uniqueness of the solution by diminishing both over parametrization and dimension of the parameter space range of parameters have been chosen sufficiently large to properly cover the solution space monte carlo procedure with a latin hypercube uniform sampling of the parameter space has been set sufficiently large to explore parameter space a sampling size of 5 105 parameter set has been generated parameter estimation is then performed based on an objective function ϕ which account for three distinct nash sutcliff efficiency nse values related to either spring discharge water table level or surface water discharge 2 ϕ l 1 m k 1 k l i 1 n k l ω k l 1 r k l 2 o b s obs 2 k l where r k l is the residual value between simulation and observation m is the number of data types spring discharge water table level and surface water discharge k l is the number of observation points for the i th data type 1 in this case and n k l is the number of observation records for the k th observation point of the l th data type n k l 1 when considering steady state values the weighing factor of each observation is 1 m every observation of each data type is then well balanced in the pre calibration objective function in the remaining of the paper the objective function considering spring discharge only will be referred to as ϕtot 1 ϕqgw the objective function considering spring discharge and water table level as ϕtot 0 5 ϕqgw 0 5 ϕqz and the objective function considering spring discharge water table level and surface discharge as ϕtot 1 3 ϕqgw 1 3 ϕqz 1 3 ϕqsw third each parameter set that equally calibrates the model with a minimum value of the objective function ϕ of 0 6 is collected 3 3 investigating future groundwater management scenarios different management scenarios have been simulated accounting for the posterior parameters set that equally calibrate the model these simulations permitted to assess the effects of various management options distinct pumping flowrate on the functioning of the karst hydrosystem under the current climate condition similar p and et we estimated the mean annual discharge and water table at the lez spring as well as the mean annual surface discharge versus the annual groundwater abstraction this has been performed while considering an increase in pumping flowrate with an increment of 0 1 m3 s 1 from 0 to 2 m3 s 1 over the same period as the calibration period 1996 2005 in order to consider highly contrasted hydrometeorological conditions predictive uncertainty was estimated from the simulations distribution that encompass all posterior parameter sets satisfying the objective function such hydrological modeling of alternative management scenarios can help us to assess the tipping point between sustainable and unsustainable groundwater management and therefore the corresponding pumping flowrate that must not be exceeded 4 results and discussion we present results of the parameter estimation procedure and uncertainty analysis then analyze the hydrological response of the hydrosystem to various groundwater withdrawal scenarios observed simulated and associated uncertainty in the calibration period are presented in fig 3 for spring discharge water table level and surface discharge table 2 shows the number of posterior parameters set that satisfied the objective function threshold of 0 6 and the best objective function obtained as a function of observation variables considered for parameter estimation we can observe that when the objective function is enriched with a new type of data the number of parameters sets satisfying the ϕ threshold of 0 6 decreases and the best value of the objective function ϕ nse in this case also decreases both for calibration and validation period it allows to gain in stability of the results and to minimize the problem of over fitting adding surface water discharge observations to the parameter estimation process allows to improve equifinality issue by reducing the number of parameter sets that equally calibrate the model and thus the parametric uncertainty the number of parameter sets decreases from 6424 when accounting for spring discharge q s only to 52 when accounting also for both water table levels at the spring and surface discharge table 1 in this way we reduce parameters set that equally satisfied the objectif function from 1 3 to 0 01 over the 5 105 tested parameter sets reducing equifinality issues and parametric uncertainty constitute an important preliminary step to improve the confidence in model results before studying alternative management scenarios and their consequences on the sustainability of groundwater resources influence of observation type posterior parameter density are presented fig 4 when the objective function accounts for both the discharge and the water table level there are very few improvements in parameter uncertainty fig 4 except for the estimation of compartment c porosity parameter ω c on the contrary when the objective function accounts for the discharge and water table level at the spring but also for the surface discharge observation uncertainty is notably reduced for almost all parameters fig 4 especially those which control surface water discharge k loss e min and fluxes between various hydrological compartments i e the epikarst compartment the matrix compartment and the karst conduit compartment k em a e m k mc aec amc results of the simulations for prospective pumping scenarios fig 5 indicate that the mean annual discharge linearly decreases as a function of the pumping flowrate and becomes null when the pumping flowrate reaches the mean inter annual spring discharge of 2 m3 s 1 theoretically pumping flowrate should be sustainable until the groundwater abstraction reaches this mean annual discharge value however when we analyze the mean annual water table in the karst conduit compartment fig 5 it decreases slowly and drops abruptly when the mean annual pumping rate reaches about 1 5 m3 s 1 to 1 7 m3 s 1 depending on predictive uncertainty which correspond to a water table level of about 45 to 55 m a s l which is 10 to 20 m under spring level beyond this value the table level drops indicate that the recharge is no longer sufficient to recover the spring water table level which can lead to several years without flow at the spring and a water table level far under the current pump level mean matrix to conduit flow decreases from the very beginning of pumping and further decreases when the pumping flowrate reaches the threshold which is between 1 5 m3 s 1 to 1 7 m3 s 1 which contributes to the water level drop in the conduit compartment fig 5 a median water table level of about 50 m a s l correspond to a pumping flow rate value around 1 6 m3 s 1 can thus be considered as a tipping point gobble 2020 indicating the change from a sustainable to an unsustainable management of the groundwater resource predictive uncertainty is then evaluated for each objective function to estimate the reliability of the prediction and to quantify the interest off adding water table level and surface discharge observations to the parameter estimation step fig 6 predictive uncertainty has been quantified by using every estimated parameter set for each objective function predictive uncertainty was estimated by a density function considering all parameter sets satisfying the objective function this allowed to consider the uncertainty associated to the predictive simulation under alternative management scenarios for each objective function this uncertainty is particularly significant for values of mean annual pumping discharge around and higher than the threshold range of 1 5 m3 s 1 to 1 7 m3 s 1 which defines the tipping point and corresponds to a median water table level of 50 m a s l however the mean annual pumping discharge distribution are noticeably different when considering each of the 3 objectives function φtot for a tipping point occurring for a selected water table level of 50 m a s l the median tipping point pumping discharge value is of 1 71 1 66 and 1 69 m2 s 1 for objective function with qgw qgw φqz and qgw φqz φqsw respectively with a standard deviation for those distribution of 0 083 0 05 and 0 033 m2 s 1 these distributions show that the uncertainty on pumping discharges associated to this tipping point is also reduced when the objective function includes complementary data i e water table level alone or both water table level and surface discharge observation fig 6 the median value of these distributions and especially the distribution obtained when the objective function φtot 1 3 φqgw 1 3 φqz 1 3 φqsw is considered in the calibration give a better estimate of the pumping flow rate threshold which defines the tipping point one limitation of the proposed method is that beyond the tipping point pumping flowrate threshold the quantified predictive uncertainty increases fig 6 this can be explained by a lack of observations at higher pumping flowrate than the mean pumping flowrate in the parameter estimation however even though the uncertainty is high this unsustainable management would generate water table levels much lower down to 150 m drawdowns than the spring overflow level when groundwater abstraction discharge changes from 1 6 m3 s 1 to 2 m3 s 1 in this case the spring will be dry most of the time as the occurrence of no flow at the lez spring would increase from 80 to 100 when pumping flow rate changes from 1 6 m3 s 1 to 2 m3 s 1 to further understand the change in hydrosystem dynamics under such anthropogenic forcing we performed simulations considering i the mean annual pumping rate of 1 m3 s 1 which corresponds to the current management scheme over the 1982 2020 period then a groundwater abstraction ii slightly below 1 5 m3 s 1 and iii above 1 7 m3 s 1 the pumping flow rate threshold when pumping flowrate overpasses 1 6 m3 s 1 threshold the water table level remains below the overflow level of the springover a very large period spring discharge is null in this case pumped groundwater comes from water stored in the aquifer during wet years i e 1987 1995 1996 cf red boxes fig 7 under the current management with a groundwater abstraction of about 1 m3 s 1 we can observe an overflow at the spring 48 of the time for a pumping flowrate of 1 5 m3 s 1 spring flows 28 of the time and 18 of the time when the pumping flowrate reaches 1 7 m3 s 1 under the current management aquifer recharge is thus sufficient to provide water at the spring every year but becomes insufficient when the pumping flowrate overpasses 1 6 m3 s 1 for example there are four complete years over 9 years with no flow at the spring for a pumping flowrate of 1 7 m3 s 1 fig 7 furthermore when groundwater abstraction overpasses the 1 6 m3 s 1 threshold there is a drastic drop of the water table level much below the authorized drawdown 30 m which corresponds to a piezometry of 35 m for greater drawdowns such as the one observed when the pumping flowrate reaches 1 7 m3 s 1 50 m the hydrodynamic response of the aquifer is unknown and the expected recovery during wet years might be altered 5 summary and conclusion the presented case study shows how the use of complementary hydrological data from different compartments of a karst hydrosystem allows improving the performance of karst hydrological modelling and noticeably reducing both parametric and predictive uncertainties the proposed karst hydrological model simulates spring discharge water table levels and surface discharge these complementary hydrological data are considered for model performance estimate on the basis of distinct objective functions the parameter estimation is performed with a bayesian procedure based on a monte carlo approach considering objectives functions that contain these complementary hydrological data when surface water discharge observations as well as water table levels and discharge observations at the spring are considered in the objective function both parametric and predictive uncertainties are greatly reduced this study also gives insights about the hydrological response of a karst hydrosystem under high anthropogenic pressure increased groundwater abstraction by analyzing the hydrodynamic response to various management options under current climate conditions a groundwater abstraction threshold maximum pumping flow rate that must not be overpassed for a sustainable management of the groundwater resource has been identified this pumping flow rate value can be considered as a tipping point in the functioning of the karst aquifer with unknown consequences on the recovery of the aquifer after successive dry years or droughts indeed we would expect that pumping flowrate corresponding to the mean interannual outflow at the spring 2 m3 s 1 should be possible however the prediction of water table levels and spring discharge shows that recharge is insufficient to recover annual water depletion each year when the pumping flowrate rate exceeds about 1 6 m3 s 1 beyond this pumping flowrate threshold no flow at the spring would be observed 44 of the time and the occurrence of such events would increase significantly for higher pumping flowrate given these results and due to the variability of hydroclimatic conditions that limits the recharge of the aquifer during some years a sustainable management of the groundwater resource will be possible only if the pumping flowrate remains below the pumping flowrate threshold of 1 6 1 7 m3 s 1 evidenced in this study it thus points out the risk of unsustainability of the water resource management especially in case of recurrent dry years this disequilibrium might not only endanger the water supply but also the downstream groundwater dependent ecosystem the proposed methodology which allows reducing hydrologic modeling uncertainty and thus improving simulations results

3231,illuminating past hydrological and climatological conditions in arid regions may provide insights into future trends in groundwater availability the main objective of this study is to explore paleorecharge processes in the deep regional nubian sandstone aquifer nsa which stretches below the hyperarid deserts of the sinai peninsula egypt and the negev israel using dissolved noble gas data extremely high amounts of dissolved excess air ne concentrations up to 4 solubility equilibrium were observed in the ancient 81kr depleted groundwater that was recharged during past pluvial epochs in the basin the observed unique excess air signal and the clear spatiotemporal structure of the noble gas compositions in the aquifer are hypothesized to reflect two major characteristics of the groundwater system a large scale long term rises in the water table that facilitate the entrapment and dissolution of air bubbles under increased hydrostatic pressure and b the geological settings in the southern recharge area in sinai including an almost horizontal position of the layers and intercalation of low permeability rock formations within the aquifer which inefficiently reject air bubbles from groundwater thereby allowing for substantial entrapment of bubbles that dissolve as the water table rises enhanced dissolution of entrapped air was also observed in other paleo groundwater containing regional sandstone aquifers across north africa which together with the recent findings from the nsa suggest that large scale water table fluctuations have likely extensively occurred during past pluvial periods over these and possibly other arid regions a preliminary assessment of noble gas recharge temperatures ngts indicates an apparent decoupling of surface and water table temperatures in the case of deep aquifers with a thick hundreds of m unsaturated zone this observed decoupling calls for a re evaluation of previously obtained ngt records and a need for future work to consider the modification of ngts due to soil air fractionation and geothermal heating of the underlying deep unsaturated zones keywords paleohydrology excess air paleoclimate nubian sandstone

however such markers are mostly related to relatively shallow groundwater bodies or apparent only at the outlets of deeper groundwater systems an approach to addressing past changes in the recharge dynamics of deeper aquifer systems is through the combination of multiple geochemical tracers among these tracers dissolved noble gases are uniquely well suited for reconstructing the environmental conditions during groundwater recharge aeschbach hertig et al 2000 aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 seltzer et al 2021b stute and schlosser 2000 quantitative information on the physical conditions of groundwater at the time of infiltration can be gained by the measurement of dissolved atmospheric noble gases including he ne ar kr and xe in general noble gas dissolution takes place at the unsaturated zone and water table interface where soil air is dissolved into the groundwater according to henry s law the equilibrium concentration of the dissolved gases depends on the prevailing temperature pressure and salinity aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 mazor 1972 the great potential of the noble gases as hydrological tracers derives from their chemical inertness and the lack of subsurface sinks and sources except for helium which accumulates from radioactive decay of u and th in aquifer minerals along a groundwater flow path andrews and lee 1979 kipfer et al 2002 lehmann et al 2003 solomon 2000 like helium isotopes 40ar is also produced in aquifer minerals and can accumulate in the subsurface especially in k rich environments lehmann et al 1993 seltzer et al 2021a torgersen et al 1989 however the abundance of atmosphere derived 40ar in groundwater in addition to the relatively low 40ar production rate and the slow diffusivity of 40ar trapped within minerals makes it difficult to detect the presence of radiogenic 40ar via conventional noble gas mass spectrometry even in very old groundwater e g patterson et al 2005 thus owing to the inertness and the extremely slow diffusivity of gases in water for all the noble gases except helium and radon half life of 4 days the original noble gas concentrations set at the water table during recharge are retained over time after groundwater becomes isolated from the overlying soil air groundwater commonly contains atmospheric ne ar kr and xe noble gases in excess of solubility equilibrium aeschbach hertig et al 2002 2000 beyerle et al 2003 corcho alvarado et al 2011 heaton and vogel 1981 this surplus component known as excess air is explained by the entrapment and partial or complete dissolution of gas bubbles under increased hydrostatic pressure the excess pressure can be created by water table fluctuations which may occur as a result of intermittent recharge aeschbach hertig et al 2002 2000 holocher et al 2002 kipfer et al 2002 stute and talma 1998 thus the excess air signal itself commonly described in terms of excess neon δne is linked to past changes in hydrological and climatic conditions e g beyerle et al 2003 klump et al 2008 kulongoski et al 2009 2004 in the present study we examine the dissolved noble gas composition of ancient groundwater in the regional transboundary nubian sandstone aquifer nsa of the sinai peninsula egypt and the negev desert israel a recently obtained well established 81kr t1 2 229 kyr age constraint on this deep aquifer system ram et al 2020 yokochi et al 2019 provides an unprecedented window for investigating past hydrogeological and hydroclimatic conditions in this currently hyperarid basin two major recharge events to the nsa including mid and late pleistocene pluvial episodes 361 30 and 38 kyr respectively were suggested by combining 81kr and water stable isotope data yokochi et al 2019 the current study aims to further explore the hydroclimatic conditions that prevailed during these and possibly other major recharge events through the dissolved noble gas record 2 study area the nsa also known locally as the kurnub group lower cretaceous era aquifer is a vital groundwater resource in the arid deserts of sinai and negev tapped by dozens of production wells rain amounts generally decrease from north to south with a mean annual precipitation of less than 50 mm over most of the region fig 1 under modern day arid conditions groundwater recharge to the nsa is estimated to be minor occurring primarily during occasional flash floods issar et al 1972 in the past long term 106 years hyperaridity has been suggested for the southern negev based on the development of reg soils amit et al 2011 although alternating wet and dry periods have been proposed based on speleothem records vaks et al 2010 beyond the sinai and negev deserts in the broader southeastern mediterranean region the nature of the past pluvial periods remains controversial abouelmagd et al 2012 2014 orland et al 2019 sultan et al 2011 vaks et al 2010 2006 yokochi et al 2019 the kurnub group is mainly composed of sandstone formations intercalated with silts and clays and has a typical thickness of 200 400 m across the study area jica 1999 kroitoru 1980 nativ et al 1987 weissbrod 1993 this group overlies a regional angular unconformity that deepens to the south and is overlain by a thick carbonate sequence of upper cretaceous rocks which acts as an additional regional aquifer the existence of a hydrological separation between the two regional aquifers was proposed based on the different salinities and hydraulic heads and supported by the presence of low permeability rock formations mainly marls and shales within the lower part of the overlying carbonate sequence e g guttman et al 1999 rosenthal et al 1981 the nsa rocks vastly outcrop south of the el tih plateau in south central sinai fig 1 and mildly dip northward to reach typical depths of hundreds of meters below the surface level where the aquifer becomes confined issar et al 1972 jica 1999 additional outcrops are found in the northern parts of the aquifer on top of the local anticlines fig 1 where the nsa rocks are uplifted above the regional water table and exposed due to deep erosion into the overlying carbonate rocks current hydraulic heads demonstrate groundwater flow in this porous system from the southern outcrops toward the natural outlets fig 1 located at the eastern margins of the gulf of suez the northern tip of the gulf of aqaba and the sedom salina south of the dead sea issar et al 1972 kroitoru et al 1980 jica 1999 rosenthal et al 2007 3 methods and research tools 3 1 field and lab methods groundwater samples were collected from deep and active production wells in the negev desert and the arava valley fig 1 except for a few inactive wells in which a submersible pump was temporarily installed for the sampling supplementary table b 1 all wells were pumped and purged prior to sampling until the stability of electrical conductivity ph temperature and dissolved oxygen was achieved to ensure the collection of a representative groundwater sample field measurements well locations and perforation intervals are reported in supplementary table b 1 samples for dissolved noble gas analysis were collected using standard copper tube samplers e g aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 and additional samples were collected for water stable isotope analysis dissolved ne ar kr and xe concentrations were measured at the noble gas lab of the university of utah usa https noblegaslab utah edu dissolved gas php water stable isotopes were measured with a picarro l2130 i instrument at the zuckerberg institute for water research israel using the cavity ring down spectroscopy method and are reported as δ2h and δ18o values with respect to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow with standard deviations of 0 5 and 0 1 respectively for radiokrypton isotopes we followed the same sampling procedure as in recent studies and we refer the reader to these publications for more information ram et al 2020 2021 yokochi et al 2019 here we report one additional 81kr and 85kr t1 2 10 7 yr measurement performed at the tracer center at the argonne national laboratory usa for an observation well from the southern arava margins

yokochi et al 2019 3 2 noble gas solubility modeling the concentrations of the non radiogenic non radioactive noble gases i e ne ar kr and xe in groundwater are a function of the temperature t salinity s and barometric pressure p at the water table at the time of recharge which together control the solubility equilibrium concentration as well as the entrapment and dissolution of soil air bubbles i e the excess air component in this study we adopt the closed system equilibration ce model of aeschbach hertig et al 2000 in which the concentration of selected gases i can be described as follows 1 c i t s p a e f c i t s p 1 f a e z i 1 f a e z i c i where c i is the solubility equilibrium concentration of the selected gas i ae is the amount of the entrapped air per unit mass of water prior to the equilibration with the water zi is the volume fraction of the selected gas in dry air and f is the fractionation parameter which is the ratio of two other parameters v the ratio between the final and initial volumes of the entrapped gas and q the ratio of the dry gas pressure of the entrapped gas to that in the free atmosphere f varies in most groundwater systems between 0 corresponding to a complete dissolution of the entrapped gas bubbles in the water and 1 corresponding to no dissolution of entrapped air bubbles and thus no excess air if reasonable assumptions can be made about the salinity and barometric pressure i e water table elevation at the time of recharge the combination of eq 1 written independently for ne ar kr and xe comprises a system of four equations with three unknown ce model parameters ae f t thus by measuring these four noble gases ae f and t can be estimated by least squares minimization aeschbach hertig et al 2000 jung and aeschbach 2018 in this study the ce model parameters as well as the derived δne which prescribes the amount of ne in excess to that of air saturated water asw at a given salinity pressure and temperature for instance δne equals 0 in the lack of excess air component were evaluated using panga software version 1 1 jung and aeschbach 2018 a salinity of 1 was assumed for the computation following the relatively low salinities observed in proximity to the recharge areas of the nsa jica 1999 ram et al 2021 the recharge elevation which corresponds to the barometric pressure at the water table during the time of recharge was assumed to be similar to the present day estimated hydrogeological settings 300 and 100 m above mean sea level amsl for the southern and northern recharge areas respectively guttman et al 1999 issar et al 1972 jica 1999 an intermediate recharge elevation of 200 m amsl was assumed in places where the mixing between water parcels originating from the two distinct recharge areas is suspected to be dominant we note that possible errors of up to 200 m in the assumed recharge elevation make little difference in recharge temperature reconstruction e g see sensitivity tests of seltzer et al 2021b relative to the measurement uncertainties all input parameters for the ce modeling with panga software are provided in supplementary table b 3 3 3 reconstruction of hydrostatic pressure changes as briefly explained in the introduction excess air dissolution may occur as a result of a rise in the water table and associated entrainment of soil air bubbles which dissolve under increased hydrostatic pressure in the quasi saturated zone e g holocher et al 2002 following ingram et al 2007 the hydrostatic pressure ph exerted on entrapped gas bubbles can be described as follows 2 p h p e q 1 where p is the barometric pressure at the water table and e is the saturation water vapor pressure q the dry gas pressure relative to that in the free atmosphere can be quantified using the ce model results ae f t by summing the partial pressures of all dissolved gases aeschbach hertig et al 2002 this can be further translated into the depth of a static water column above the entrapped gas ingram et al 2007 3 d w p e q 1 ρ g where ρ is the water density and g is the acceleration due to gravity 4 results 4 1 dissolved noble gas concentrations and ce model results the measured dissolved noble gas bulk concentrations in the nsa including ne ar kr and xe are given in table 1 before any attempts at quantitatively modeling the noble gas data we first show dissolved ne concentrations alongside published 81kr ages ram et al 2020 2021 yokochi et al 2019 and δ18o values for examination of the obtained noble gas data fig 2 we observe an extreme ne enrichment relative to asw in the older 18o depleted groundwater from the southern negev and the southern arava valley hereafter defined as group 1 for which the recharge through the southern outcrops in sinai is dominant yokochi et al 2019 conversely we observe much lower ne contents still slightly above asw fig 2 moving north in the study area with the lowest concentration associated with the youngest groundwater group 2 supplementary table b 2 near atmospheric 81kr activity the highest δ18o values and 14c activities of 5 15 percent of modern carbon pmc correlative to ages of 10 20 kyr were measured within the northern negev recharge area hazera anticline fig 2 together with the elevated 85kr activity 10 of the current atmospheric ratio these observations support the presence of both old and recent 60 yr groundwater components in the phreatic zone ram et al 2020 2021 comparatively moderate ne concentrations were obtained along an adjacent confined flow segment of the aquifer northern flow path fig 2 in which the dominance of late pleistocene recharge through the adjacent outcrops is supported by relatively low 81kr ages 100 kyr and high δ18o values group 3 somewhat higher ne concentrations were measured along the eastern flow segment that stretches along the northern arava valley s margins group 4 eastern flow path fig 2 intermediate 81kr ages 100 260 kyr and δ18o values along this flow path reflect the mixing of groundwater originating from the two dominant recharge events yokochi et al 2019 the ce model parameters including ae f and t were computed using the noble gas concentrations table 1 relatively high ae values of 0 03 0 06 ccstp g where stp indicates standard temperature and pressure and low f values mostly below 0 1 were obtained for the groundwater samples from the southern negev group 1 the latter parameter is related to the pressure exerted on the entrapped gas during the dissolution process aeschbach hertig et al 2002 and thus provides potential insight into the prevailing hydrological conditions at the time of recharge the low f values are accompanied by high δne values of 200 500 340 on average n 6 fig 3 much higher than typically measured in sandstone aquifers e g kipfer et al 2002 while we note that high δne can arise from sampling errors if gas bubbles are trapped in the copper sampling tubes we suggest that this is unlikely in the current case because 1 sample collection was carefully performed with high fluid pressure maintained in the cu tube 2 duplicate samples show consistent δne values 3 a high δne value in paran 20 well was also reported in a former study schuldenfrei 2010 table 1 and 4 there is a clear geographic structure in δne values throughout the study area an order of magnitude lower δne values 10 50 were observed in groundwater samples from the northern negev where recharge through the northern outcrops seems dominant groups 2 and 3 ae values are mostly lower for these northern groups 0 01 0 04 ccstp g whereas f values are higher 0 4 0 8 fig 3 for the group of samples that based on intermediate 81kr ages and δ18o values most likely represent mixtures between northern and southern source end members group 4 ae f and δne values of 0 01 0 04 ccstp g 0 1 0 4 and 70 170 were computed respectively ce model solutions with high χ2 values and low probabilities 1 were obtained for some of the samples in this group table 1 indicating an incongruent model data fit among the four noble gases yet we note that the computed model parameters i e ae f and t for these samples are all intermediate with respect to other samples with higher probabilities based on this observation it seems reasonable to assume that the ce model still produces reasonable estimates and we therefore included these samples with lower probabilities in the following discussion 5 discussion 5 1 different excess air patterns for distinct recharge areas analysis of the measured dissolved noble gas concentrations highlights that different excess air signals are recorded in the nsa the lower enrichment in ne concentrations recognized in samples from the northern parts of the aquifer groups 2 and 3 is accompanied by low kr xe ratios which are similar to the solubility ratio 7 5 at 25 c fig 4 in contrast the ne enriched samples from the southern negev group 1 are characterized by higher kr xe ratios of 9 0 the deviation of this group from the predicted kr xe solubility ratio corresponds to a shift into values that are closer to the atmospheric mole fractions ratio 13 1 such a shift is in accordance with an enhanced dissolution of entrapped air bubbles we note that previously published noble gas data from sinai abouelmagd et al 2014 included in the current discussion supplementary table b 4 display a similar relationship further strengthening our interpretation of distinct dissolved noble gas signatures as indications of different recharge sources to the nsa fig 4 elevated kr xe ratios and ne concentrations were measured in the south central sinai including in the el themed 2 and nekhel 5 wells fig 1 and lower values were obtained in the arif el naqa 2 and el hasana 3 wells located nearby or downstream from the northern sinai recharge areas hereafter defined as groups 5 and 6 respectively a striking observation is the finding of a similar dissolved noble gas signal both in the el themed 2 well which is located only 50 km from the southern outcrops in sinai fig 1 and in the southern arava valley e g yotvata t 9 well fig 2 200 km downstream of the flow path groups 5 and 1 respectively fig 4 this similarity indicates that enhanced dissolution of entrained air is a widespread phenomenon for the recharge through the southern outcrops furthermore this enhanced dissolution might have occurred during different recharge episodes the oldest episode is recorded underneath the southern negev where 81kr ages of 300 400 kyr are prevalent and 14c activity is negligible 1 pmc supplementary table b 2 while younger episode s are expected to be recorded upstream namely underneath the south central sinai even though no 81kr data is available for this part of the aquifer a somewhat higher 14c activity of 4 pmc was observed in el themed 2 abouelmagd et al 2014 indicating the presence of younger groundwater similarity in the excess air signals in groundwater that was recharged at distinct times is also observed in the northern negev including in the younger groundwater at the hazera anticline recharge area where elevated 14c activities were identified supplementary table b 2 and the older groundwater in the nearby confined section of the aquifer groups 2 and 3 respectively fig 4 furthermore the deuterium excess dex δ2h 8 δ18o signature is dissimilar between these two groups table 1 and serves as evidence for recharge under different climatic conditions ram et al 2020 yokochi et al 2019 the observation of similar excess air signals in groundwater parcels that were recharged through the same recharge areas at different times and under varying hydroclimatic conditions points to the specific hydrogeological characteristics of the recharge areas as a significant controlling factor in the entrapment and dissolution of soil air and thus the generation of excess air in groundwater 5 2 paleo water table rise as hydroclimate indicator we further interpret the ce model parameters constrained by noble gas measurements in the nsa to calculate the depth of the average water column dw eq 3 above the entrapped air bubbles we also compute dw values for the previously published noble gas data from sinai abouelmagd et al 2014 following the computation of the ce model parameters supplementary table b 3 the computed dw values fig 5 suggest that the enhanced dissolution of entrapped air in the southern recharge area represented by groups 1 and 5 has taken place under increased water head pressures of a few tens of meters lower dw values of a few meters are computed for the recharge through the northern recharge areas groups 2 3 6 and intermediate values mostly 5 10 m are obtained for the mixing group though we urge caution in interpreting the mixed samples of group 4 see section 5 4 it should be noted that the maximal water table rise might have been higher than the computed dw values as the dissolved noble gas composition reflects the dissolution of air bubbles at various depths below the water table and in addition integrates the noble gas compositions of groundwater recharged over a hundreds of square km wide recharge area and prolonged pluvial episodes e g seltzer et al 2019a stute and schlosser 1993 as further discussed below we hypothesize that the elevated dw values on the order of tens of meters represent a long term slowly rising water table to illustrate this concept we evaluate the maximal impact of annual recharge under the current climate conditions an average recharge rate of 13 106 m3 yr was estimated for the southern recharge area in sinai using the soil and water assessment tool model for the years 1998 2007 sultan et al 2011 a phreatic surface extent of 1000 km2 was evaluated for the aquifer below the recharge area jica 1999 by adopting an effective porosity of 0 1 calvo et al 2014 nativ et al 1987 we crudely estimate that the volume of annual recharge would be equivalent to a water table rise of 0 1 m if 100 of annual recharge contributed to aquifer storage practically the actual change in heads at the water table is expected to be smaller and in fact the water table would be expected to be declining under the current aridity issar et al 1972 yet this calculation gives the sense that even if precipitation amounts were doubled during former pluvial epochs e g issar and bruins 1983 such that the water table gradually rose over these intervals a long period of hundreds to thousands of years with increased recharge would be required to produce the observed dissolved noble gas signal in the nsa the process of air bubble entrainment and dissolution under a slowly rising water table is conceptually different from other classical descriptions of entrapment and dissolution under rapid water table fluctuations e g holocher et al 2002 ingram et al 2007 mächler et al 2013 it is conceivable that under a scenario in which the water table rises gradually groundwater with high dissolved gas concentrations may equilibrate via diffusion with the overlying soil air and thus the excess dissolved gas might be transferred back to the overlying soil air however if the dissolution process takes place at a considerable depth below the water table as deduced from the δne signature then diffusive re equilibration cannot occur nor can the δne anomaly be eliminated see an evaluation of the conceptual model in supplementary note a 1 conceptually a large scale water table rise is in agreement with the previously identified major mid pleistocene recharge event that was active over the southern recharge area in sinai yokochi et al 2019 currently the southern recharge area receives lower precipitation amounts compared to the northern recharge areas in the negev 50 versus 100 mm yr on average fig 1 therefore and in light of the suggested long term 106 yr hyperaridity amit et al 2011 the transition from extremely arid to somewhat wetter conditions over the southern recharge area may have resulted in a larger overall water table rise compared to characteristic water table fluctuations in the slightly less arid northern regions thus we propose that not only can the δne signal be used to identify rapid water level fluctuations following more humid conditions e g beyerle et al 2003 kulongoski et al 2004 stute and talma 1998 but it may also indicate gradual widespread rises in regional water tables this corresponds to the enhancement of the regional water budget following wetter episodes in the dry southeastern mediterranean such wetter periods were probably triggered by changes in the atmospheric circulation and synoptic conditions e g armon et al 2018 vaks et al 2006 yokochi et al 2019 orland et al 2019 5 3 the nubian rock formations a trap for small air bubbles beyond the hydroclimate context the different dissolved noble gas signals may also reflect different hydrogeological settings across the nsa s distinct recharge areas fig 6 the northern negev outcrops are scattered on top of asymmetric anticlines fig 1 with steep flanks dipping 6 90 significantly greater than the sub horizontal position 1 dip of the rocks in the southern recharge area in sinai jica 1999 zilberman 2000 the combination of the sub horizontal position and the intercalation of clays and silts within the aquifer which inefficiently reject air bubbles from the groundwater due to their lower permeability further discussed below could potentially allow significant entrapment of bubbles that dissolve as the water table rises we therefore hypothesize that the lower amounts of dissolved entrapped air in the northern recharge areas are also related to a less effective air bubble trap due to the steeper flanks efficient air bubble traps should exist in the nsa s rocks to facilitate the entrapment and dissolution process holocher et al 2002 ingram et al 2007 mächler et al 2013 indeed the aquifer is characterized by fining upward grain size sequences with low permeability layers at the top of each set barakat et al 1986 weissbrod 1993 and the prevalence of small 0 02 µm pore throats calvo et al 2014 small air bubbles which are more likely to go through a complete dissolution under smaller changes in the hydrostatic pressure holocher et al 2002 could potentially be entrapped within this small grain sub horizontal matrix moreover the narrowing of the pores and the pore throats may further facilitate the enhanced dissolution of air bubbles as a result of increased capillary pressures mercury et al 2004 thus both macro and micro scale observations support the existence of efficient air bubble traps in the nsa 5 4 derivations of the ce model parameters in the case of groundwater mixing groundwater recharge under varying hydroclimatic conditions and hydrogeological settings results in the creation of groundwater parcels with different noble gas signatures we note that mixing between two or more groundwater parcels with distinct geochemical compositions complicates the estimation of the ce model parameters from measured noble gas concentrations due to non linearity in the underlying equations of the ce model e g the temperature dependences of solubility thus direct interpretation of the physical derivations of the ce model parameters e g ae q and dw values aeschbach hertig et al 2000 ingram et al 2007 in samples highly affected by mixing such as in the case of group 4 is not advisable this argument is partially supported by ce model solutions with relatively high χ2 values and low probabilities for a few of this group s samples table 1 to illustrate how the mixing of two groundwater bodies with a different dissolved noble gas signature would behave on a δne versus f plot we use the average dissolved noble gas concentrations of groups 1 and 3 as approximations for the compositions of the two dominant end members next a mixing line between these two end members is created fig 3 based on the ce model results for synthetic groundwater samples with different mixing ratios group 4 samples generally fall close to this hypothetical mixing line we therefore caution the reader against a direct interpretation of ce model parameters for these highly mixed samples as we suspect that as formerly proposed by yokochi et al 2019 based on the 81kr dex correlation in the nsa group 4 mainly represents admixtures of groundwater derived from two recharge sources characterized by highly complete f 0 1 and moderately incomplete f 0 4 bubble dissolution rather than a single recharge source with intermediate f values 0 1 0 4 even though the latter scenario cannot be eliminated at this point 5 5 decoupling of noble gas and surface temperatures the reconstructed noble gas temperatures ngts in the nsa table 1 computed with the ce model under the conventional assumption of a closed system equilibration between water and atmospheric air at the water table range from 24 3 2 1 c to 29 6 2 2 c in the southern negev group 1 and from 24 8 2 3 c to 27 9 3 3 c in the northern negev groups 2 and 3 an exceptionally high ngt of 34 6 2 9 c was computed in the zofar 20 well for which an ascension of a very old and more saline groundwater body supplementary tables b 1 and b 2 from deeper rock formations into the nsa was suggested ram et al 2020 while the increased salinity in this well could be explained by the contribution of a small fraction a few of the total volume of brine ram et al 2020 the similarity in both the δne value and the stable isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h values to those of most nsa wells in the region group 1 in table 1 serves as evidence for earlier recharge episodes that took place under similar hydroclimatic conditions the ngt discrepancy could be explained by surplus geothermal heating due to a deeper water table i e a thicker unsaturated zone in the recharge area for the deeper rock formations noticeably the computed ngts in the negev desert groundwater are higher than the current mean annual air temperatures maat recorded by weather stations scattered over the region 18 21 c supplementary note a 2 the upward shifting of the computed ngts above the maat fig 7 is even more prominent if considering that recharge might have taken place under a colder glacial climate abouelmagd et al 2014 issar and bruins 1983 yokochi et al 2019 however it should be noted that ngt represents the ambient soil temperature at the water table at the time of recharge not of the free atmosphere in the case of the nsa the water table is mostly found at depths of hundreds of meters below the surface level and therefore the noble gas temperature is linked to the mean annual surface temperature mast which is usually several degrees higher than the air temperature in low mid latitude arid regions e g aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 beyerle et al 2003 by the prevailing geothermal gradients for further exploration and interpretation of the ngt results the current temperatures at the water table below the distinct recharge areas of the nsa were assessed first surface temperatures were evaluated using shallow a few tens of m deep observation wells over the studied region supplementary note a 2 with a concluded mast of 21 23 c and 21 25 c for the southern and the northern recharge areas respectively next the current water table depths in the phreatic zones downstream of the nsa recharge areas were evaluated an average depth of 500 700 m below surface level for the southern recharge area in sinai issar et al 1972 jica 1999 and 400 700 m for the northern recharge areas in the negev supplementary note a 3 under these settings and using a geothermal gradient of 20 25 c km 1 abdel zaher et al 2014 shalev et al 2013 2007 the current temperature at the water table below the southern recharge area in sinai is estimated to range from 31 to 40 c higher than the ngt range of 23 30 c recorded in the related paleo groundwater groups 1 and 5 fig 7 for the northern recharge areas a current water table temperature range of 29 42 c is estimated above the ngt range of 24 28 c obtained for the related groundwater clusters groups 2 and 3 thus 1 a strong decoupling of water table and surface temperatures is anticipated under the current hydrological conditions for both the southern and northern recharge areas due to the impact of the geothermal heat and 2 apparent ngts in the old groundwater are lower than the estimated current water table temperatures lower than present day recharge temperatures may serve as an indication for recharge under a climate colder than the present for instance ngt records from other aquifers located in low mid latitudes exhibit an average cooling of 6 c during the last glacial maximum e g beyerle et al 2003 kulongoski et al 2004 seltzer et al 2021b weyhenmeyer et al 2000 however the lower recharge temperatures can also represent higher paleo water heads i e shallower water tables at the recharge area resulting in reduced geothermal heating as the current water heads are not necessarily representative of those that prevailed in the system over past long term centurial to millennial pluvial periods e g schulz et al 2017 either lower maat or higher water heads could lead to the same result of lower ngt and the simultaneous quantification of both parameters is not possible with noble gas concentrations alone although it is outside the scope of this work we suggest that quantitatively deconvolving these effects may be possible through the application of a new technique to reconstruct past water table depth using dissolved kr and xe isotopes measured at high precision seltzer et al 2019b 2019a atmospheric air fractionation in the deep vadose zone the ce model results presented and discussed thus far are based on a fundamental assumption that the composition of the soil air that equilibrates with the water at the water table hundreds of meters below the surface level is similar to that of atmosphericair however fractionation and deviation from the atmospheric air composition can occur as a result of several processes most importantly gravitational settling seltzer et al 2017 severinghaus et al 1996 which may result in a relative enrichment in the concentrations of the heavier noble gases with increasing depth for instance extrapolation of the fractionation model proposed by severinghaus et al 1996 to a depth of 600 m below surface level results in an increase of 1 2 12 and 24 in the ne ar kr and xe mole fractions respectively supplementary fig c 1 namely a significant enrichment in the fractionated soil air xe and the dissolved xe accordingly is expected according to this model for a deep groundwater system such as the nsa in theory gravitational enrichment should lead to a cold ngt bias and poor goodness of fit when a traditional noble gas model is used i e one that assumes atmospheric as opposed to gravitationally enriched noble gas mixing ratios however surprisingly the kr xe signal in the ne rich samples from the southern negev group 1 related to the recharge through the deep unsaturated zone in the southern recharge area is similar to that expected from equilibrium and unfractionated excess air rather than to that of fractionated air fig 4 the gap between the predicted and observed excess air dissolution pattern might be explained by different physical mechanisms for instance paleo water tables in the southern recharge area could have been higher than they are today another possible explanation is that the unsaturated zone atmosphere in the nsa is sufficiently mixed by turbulence perhaps due to strong barometric pumping events e g scanlon et al 2002 that the full theoretical effect of gravitational settling is weakened by advection of unfractionated atmospheric air to the deep unsaturated zone further exploration of the fractionation process has vast implications for the interpretation of noble gas data in deep groundwater systems with a thick unsaturated zone but is beyond the scope of this contribution regardless of the question on fractionated or unfractionated air in a deep unsaturated zone the evidence of a high amount of excess neon remains unchanged as ne both is highly insensitive to recharge temperature owing to its weak solubility temperature dependence jenkins et al 2019 and to gravitational fractionation due to the similar molar weight of 22ne to mean air 29 g mol 1 because gravitational fractionation is proportional to the molar weight difference from mean air 22ne is 15 less sensitive to gravitational fractionation than 132xe for example 5 6 a regional overview of excess air patterns in north african aquifers the very high ne concentrations obtained for the deep sandstone aquifer of the sinai and negev deserts reaching about four times solubility equilibrium values in the most enriched groundwater samples group 1 are underappreciated yet nonunique in the region two to three times higher than solubility ne concentrations were obtained in the nubian sandstone aquifer system of the western desert in egypt patterson et al 2005 and southeast libya al faitouri 2013 as well as in the continental intercalaire sandstone aquifer in tunisia petersen et al 2018 the high ne concentrations in these desert aquifers were observed in 4he rich groundwater suggesting increased groundwater ages these observations highlight the prevalence of high excess air signals in north african sandstone aquifers that were filled during major paleorecharge events the enhanced dissolution of entrapped air bubbles is not limited to sandstone aquifers in arid regions for instance increased δne values of 150 were identified in regional sandstone aquifers located in semi arid basins such as the continental terminal and continental intercalaire in niger andrews et al 1994 beyerle et al 2003 wilson and mcneill 1997 the stampriet aquifer in namibia stute and talma 1998 and the kalahari aquifer in botswana kulongoski et al 2004 an even higher δne value of 300 was reported for a single sample from the navajo sandstone aquifer located in a semi arid basin in northern arizona zhu and kipfer 2010 in all these examples the increased δne values were related to a period of increased rain intensity thus there exists considerable global evidence that enhanced dissolution of entrapped air is a widespread phenomenon in sandstone aquifers at least in arid and semi arid regions examination of the specific hydrogeological settings in the recharge areas of each of the above mentioned groundwater systems may provide a broader perspective on the exact conditions and mechanisms under which unusually high excess air is formed and may help to improve the use of these and other aquifers as archives of past hydroclimatic conditions 6 summary and conclusions the exceptionally high dissolved noble gas concentrations in the nsa constitute evidence for large scale water table rises that occurred up to hundreds of kyr ago in this currently hyperarid region the coupling of noble gas concentrations with the 81kr dating constraints reveals a clear spatiotemporal structure of the noble gas signature and combined with the water stable isotope data further illuminates the magnitude and significance of a major recharge event that occurred in the basin under a distinct climate 360 kyr ago yokochi et al 2019 the hydroclimatic drivers are complemented by the hydrogeological settings in the southern recharge area including a sub horizontal position and sets of fining upward grains which enhance the entrapment and dissolution of air bubbles under a slowly rising water table distinct air entrapment and dissolution patterns are recorded in different parts of the nsa suggesting that the noble gas concentrations in general and the excess air signature specifically can serve as valuable tools for tracing groundwater origin and understanding past hydroclimatic changes in the recharge areas high amounts of dissolved excess air were identified in different regional aquifers located in arid and semi arid regions over the globe surprisingly we found that despite an expectation for a low excess air component in groundwater recharged through a sandstone matrix a long term water table rise in sandstone aquifers in arid regions typically characterized by a thick unsaturated vadose zone could lead to high excess air signals the entrapment and dissolution process in these arid regions is probably amplified by the intermittent very dry and somewhat wetter periods therefore we suggest that δne preserves key information about the magnitude of past water table rises and drops with insights into the natural trends in water levels and predicted changes in flow gradients such information is essential for groundwater flow modeling and resource management furthermore it provides a necessary constraint for long term hydrological changes under varying hydroclimates the fact that the highest δne values correlate with paleo groundwater over the north african continent may serve as broader evidence for the distinct pluvial climatic conditions that prevailed during past epochs over this currently hyperarid region finally the decoupling of surface and water table temperatures due to the geothermal heat of the latter is apparent in the noble gas record of a deep aquifer such as the nsa this finding emphasizes the importance of further exploration of soil air fractionation processes in the deep unsaturated zone and possible reexamination of previously obtained ngt records in other deep aquifer systems worldwide in which unsaturated zone fractionation processes and the impact of the geothermal heating of the water table were not taken into account in interpreting apparent ngts credit authorship contribution statement roi ram conceptualization formal analysis investigation project administration validation

3231,illuminating past hydrological and climatological conditions in arid regions may provide insights into future trends in groundwater availability the main objective of this study is to explore paleorecharge processes in the deep regional nubian sandstone aquifer nsa which stretches below the hyperarid deserts of the sinai peninsula egypt and the negev israel using dissolved noble gas data extremely high amounts of dissolved excess air ne concentrations up to 4 solubility equilibrium were observed in the ancient 81kr depleted groundwater that was recharged during past pluvial epochs in the basin the observed unique excess air signal and the clear spatiotemporal structure of the noble gas compositions in the aquifer are hypothesized to reflect two major characteristics of the groundwater system a large scale long term rises in the water table that facilitate the entrapment and dissolution of air bubbles under increased hydrostatic pressure and b the geological settings in the southern recharge area in sinai including an almost horizontal position of the layers and intercalation of low permeability rock formations within the aquifer which inefficiently reject air bubbles from groundwater thereby allowing for substantial entrapment of bubbles that dissolve as the water table rises enhanced dissolution of entrapped air was also observed in other paleo groundwater containing regional sandstone aquifers across north africa which together with the recent findings from the nsa suggest that large scale water table fluctuations have likely extensively occurred during past pluvial periods over these and possibly other arid regions a preliminary assessment of noble gas recharge temperatures ngts indicates an apparent decoupling of surface and water table temperatures in the case of deep aquifers with a thick hundreds of m unsaturated zone this observed decoupling calls for a re evaluation of previously obtained ngt records and a need for future

collon et al 2000 jasechko et al 2017 matsumoto et al 2020 sturchio et al 2004 and serves as a record for past more pluvial periods prolonged pluvial episodes may have caused changes in the flow pattern of such deep aquifers including increases in water heads and or migration of the natural outlets e g levy et al 2019 schulz et al 2017 these changes in the flow structure may leave terrestrial traces behind such as fossil spring deposits e g travertine or even paleo lake sediments e g ginat et al 2018 hamdan and brook 2015 issar and bruins 1983 levy et al 2019 livnat and kronfeld 1985 however such markers are mostly related to relatively shallow groundwater bodies or apparent only at the outlets of deeper groundwater systems an approach to addressing past changes in the recharge dynamics of deeper aquifer systems is through the combination of multiple geochemical tracers among these tracers dissolved noble gases are uniquely well suited for reconstructing the environmental conditions during groundwater recharge aeschbach hertig et al 2000 aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 seltzer et al 2021b stute and schlosser 2000 quantitative information on the physical conditions of groundwater at the time of infiltration can be gained by the measurement of dissolved atmospheric noble gases including he ne ar kr and xe in general noble gas dissolution takes place at the unsaturated zone and water table interface where soil air is dissolved into the groundwater according to henry s law the equilibrium concentration of the dissolved gases depends on the prevailing temperature pressure and salinity aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 mazor 1972 the great potential of the noble gases as hydrological tracers derives from their chemical inertness and the lack of subsurface sinks and sources except for helium which accumulates from radioactive decay of u and th in aquifer minerals along a groundwater flow path andrews and lee 1979 kipfer et al 2002 lehmann et al 2003 solomon 2000 like helium isotopes 40ar is also produced in aquifer minerals and can accumulate in the subsurface especially in k rich environments lehmann et al 1993 seltzer et al 2021a torgersen et al 1989 however the abundance of atmosphere derived 40ar in groundwater in addition to the relatively low 40ar production rate and the slow diffusivity of 40ar trapped within minerals makes it difficult to detect the presence of radiogenic 40ar via conventional noble gas mass spectrometry even in very old groundwater e g patterson et al 2005 thus owing to the inertness and the extremely slow diffusivity of gases in water for all the noble gases except helium and radon half life of 4 days the original noble gas concentrations set at the water table during recharge are retained over time after groundwater becomes isolated from the overlying soil air groundwater commonly contains atmospheric ne ar kr and xe noble gases in excess of solubility equilibrium aeschbach hertig et al 2002 2000 beyerle et al 2003 corcho alvarado et al 2011 heaton and vogel 1981 this surplus component known as excess air is explained by the entrapment and partial or complete dissolution of gas bubbles under increased hydrostatic pressure the excess pressure can be created by water table fluctuations which may occur as a result of intermittent recharge aeschbach hertig et al 2002 2000 holocher et al 2002 kipfer et al 2002 stute and talma 1998 thus the excess air signal itself commonly described in terms of excess neon δne is linked to past changes in hydrological and climatic conditions e g beyerle et al 2003 klump et al 2008 kulongoski et al 2009 2004 in the present study we examine the dissolved noble gas composition of ancient groundwater in the regional transboundary nubian sandstone aquifer nsa of the sinai peninsula egypt and the negev desert israel a recently obtained well established 81kr t1 2 229 kyr age constraint on this deep aquifer system ram et al 2020 yokochi et al 2019 provides an unprecedented window for investigating past hydrogeological and hydroclimatic conditions in this currently hyperarid basin two major recharge events to the nsa including mid and late pleistocene pluvial episodes 361 30 and 38 kyr respectively were suggested by combining 81kr and water stable isotope data yokochi et al 2019 the current study aims to further explore the hydroclimatic conditions that prevailed during these and possibly other major recharge events through the dissolved noble gas record 2 study area the nsa also known locally as the kurnub group lower cretaceous era aquifer is a vital groundwater resource in the arid deserts of sinai and negev tapped by dozens of production wells rain amounts generally decrease from north to south with a mean annual precipitation of less than 50 mm over most of the region fig 1 under modern day arid conditions groundwater recharge to the nsa is estimated to be minor occurring primarily during occasional flash floods issar et al 1972 in the past long term 106 years hyperaridity has been suggested for the southern negev based on the development of reg soils amit et al 2011 although alternating wet and dry periods have been proposed based on speleothem records vaks et al 2010 beyond the sinai and negev deserts in the broader southeastern mediterranean region the nature of the past pluvial periods remains controversial abouelmagd et al 2012 2014 orland et al 2019 sultan et al 2011 vaks et al 2010 2006 yokochi et al 2019 the kurnub group is mainly composed of sandstone formations intercalated with silts and clays and has a typical thickness of 200 400 m across the study area jica 1999 kroitoru 1980 nativ et al 1987 weissbrod 1993 this group overlies a regional angular unconformity that deepens to the south and is overlain by a thick carbonate sequence of upper cretaceous rocks which acts as an additional regional aquifer the existence of a hydrological separation between the two regional aquifers was proposed based on the different salinities and hydraulic heads and supported by the presence of low permeability rock formations mainly marls and shales within the lower part of the overlying carbonate sequence e g guttman et al 1999 rosenthal et al 1981 the nsa rocks vastly outcrop south of the el tih plateau in south central sinai fig 1 and mildly dip northward to reach typical depths of hundreds of meters below the surface level where the aquifer becomes confined issar et al 1972 jica 1999 additional outcrops are found in the northern parts of the aquifer on top of the local anticlines fig 1 where the nsa rocks are uplifted above the regional water table and exposed due to deep erosion into the overlying carbonate rocks current hydraulic heads demonstrate groundwater flow in this porous system from the southern outcrops toward the natural outlets fig 1 located at the eastern margins of the gulf of suez the northern tip of the gulf of aqaba and the sedom salina south of the dead sea issar et al 1972 kroitoru et al 1980 jica 1999 rosenthal et al 2007 3 methods and research tools 3 1 field and lab methods groundwater samples were collected from deep and active production wells in the negev desert and the arava valley fig 1 except for a few inactive wells in which a submersible pump was temporarily installed for the sampling supplementary table b 1 all wells were pumped and purged prior to sampling until the stability of electrical conductivity ph temperature and dissolved oxygen was achieved to ensure the collection of a representative groundwater sample field measurements well locations and perforation intervals are reported in supplementary table b 1 samples for dissolved noble gas analysis were collected using standard copper tube samplers e g aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 and additional samples were collected for water stable isotope analysis dissolved ne ar kr and xe concentrations were measured at the noble gas lab of the university of utah usa https noblegaslab utah edu dissolved gas php water stable isotopes were measured with a picarro l2130 i instrument at the zuckerberg institute for water research israel using the cavity ring down spectroscopy method and are reported as δ2h and δ18o values with respect to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow with standard deviations of 0 5 and 0 1 respectively for radiokrypton isotopes we followed the same sampling procedure as in recent studies and we refer the reader to these publications for more information ram et al 2020 2021 yokochi et al 2019 here we report one additional 81kr and 85kr t1 2 10 7 yr measurement performed at the tracer center at the argonne national laboratory usa for an observation well from the southern arava margins yotvata t 9 fig 2 the 81kr age of 376 33 kyr and the negligible 85kr activity supplementary table b 2 obtained in this well are consistent with the previously identified mid pleistocene recharge event yokochi et al 2019 3 2 noble gas solubility modeling the concentrations of the non radiogenic non radioactive noble gases i e ne ar kr and xe in groundwater are a function of the temperature t salinity s and barometric pressure p at the water table at the time of recharge which together control the solubility equilibrium concentration as well as the entrapment and dissolution of soil air bubbles i e the excess air component in this study we adopt the closed system equilibration ce model of aeschbach hertig et al 2000 in which the concentration of selected gases i can be described as follows 1 c i t s p a e f c i t s p 1 f a e z i 1 f a e z i c i where c i is the solubility equilibrium concentration of the selected gas i ae is the amount of the entrapped air per unit mass of water prior to the equilibration with the water zi is the volume fraction of the selected gas in dry air and f is the fractionation parameter which is the ratio of two other parameters v the ratio between the final and initial volumes of the entrapped gas and q the ratio of the dry gas pressure of the entrapped gas to that in the free atmosphere f varies in most groundwater systems between 0 corresponding to a complete dissolution of the entrapped gas bubbles in the water and 1 corresponding to no dissolution of entrapped air bubbles and thus no excess air if reasonable assumptions can be made about the salinity and barometric pressure i e water table elevation at the time of recharge the combination of eq 1 written independently for ne ar kr and xe comprises a system of four equations with three unknown ce model parameters ae f t thus by measuring these four noble gases ae f and t can be estimated by least squares minimization aeschbach hertig et al 2000 jung and aeschbach 2018 in this study the ce model parameters as well as the derived δne which prescribes the amount of ne in excess to that of air saturated water asw at a given salinity pressure and temperature for instance δne equals 0 in the lack of excess air component were evaluated using panga software version 1 1 jung and aeschbach 2018 a salinity of 1 was assumed for the computation following the relatively low salinities observed in proximity to the recharge areas of the nsa jica 1999 ram et al 2021 the recharge elevation which corresponds to the barometric pressure at the water table during the time of recharge was assumed to be similar to the present day estimated hydrogeological settings 300 and 100 m above mean sea level amsl for the southern and northern recharge areas respectively guttman et al 1999 issar et al 1972 jica 1999 an intermediate recharge elevation of 200 m amsl was assumed in places where the mixing between water parcels originating from the two distinct recharge areas is suspected to be dominant we note that possible errors of up to 200 m in the assumed recharge elevation make little difference in recharge temperature reconstruction e g see sensitivity tests of seltzer et al 2021b relative to the measurement uncertainties all input parameters for the ce modeling with panga software are provided in supplementary table b 3 3 3 reconstruction of hydrostatic pressure changes as briefly explained in the introduction excess air dissolution may occur as a result of a rise in the water table and associated entrainment of soil air bubbles which dissolve under increased hydrostatic pressure in the quasi saturated zone e g holocher et al 2002 following ingram et al 2007 the hydrostatic pressure ph exerted on entrapped gas bubbles can be described as follows 2 p h p e q 1 where p is the barometric pressure at the water table and e is the saturation water vapor pressure q the dry gas pressure relative to that in the free atmosphere can be quantified using the ce model results ae f t by summing the partial pressures of all dissolved gases aeschbach hertig et al 2002 this can be further translated into the depth of a static water column above the entrapped gas ingram et al 2007 3 d w p e q 1 ρ g where ρ is the water density and g is the acceleration due to gravity 4 results 4 1 dissolved noble gas concentrations and ce model results the measured dissolved noble gas bulk concentrations in the nsa including ne ar kr and xe are given in table 1 before any attempts at quantitatively modeling the noble gas data we first show dissolved ne concentrations alongside published 81kr ages ram et al 2020 2021 yokochi et al 2019 and δ18o values for examination of the obtained noble gas data fig 2 we observe an extreme ne enrichment relative to asw in the older 18o depleted groundwater from the southern negev and the southern arava valley hereafter defined as group 1 for which the recharge through the southern outcrops in sinai is dominant yokochi et al 2019 conversely we observe much lower ne contents still slightly above asw fig 2 moving north in the study area with the lowest concentration associated with the youngest groundwater group 2 supplementary table b 2 near atmospheric 81kr activity the highest δ18o values and 14c activities of 5 15 percent of modern carbon pmc correlative to ages of 10 20 kyr were measured within the northern negev recharge area hazera anticline fig 2 together with the elevated 85kr activity 10 of the current atmospheric ratio these observations support the presence of both old and recent 60 yr groundwater components in the phreatic zone ram et al 2020 2021 comparatively moderate ne concentrations were obtained along an adjacent confined flow segment of the aquifer northern flow path fig 2 in which the dominance of late pleistocene recharge through the adjacent outcrops is supported by relatively low 81kr ages 100 kyr and high δ18o values group 3 somewhat higher ne concentrations were measured along the eastern flow segment that stretches along the northern arava valley s margins group 4 eastern flow path fig 2 intermediate 81kr ages 100 260 kyr and δ18o values along this flow path reflect the mixing of groundwater originating from the two dominant recharge events yokochi et al 2019 the ce model parameters including ae f and t were computed using the noble gas concentrations table 1 relatively high ae values of 0 03 0 06 ccstp g where stp indicates standard temperature and pressure and low f values mostly below 0 1 were obtained for the groundwater samples from the southern negev group 1 the latter parameter is related to the pressure exerted on the entrapped gas during the dissolution process aeschbach hertig et al 2002 and thus provides potential insight into the prevailing hydrological conditions at the time of recharge the low f values are accompanied by high δne values of 200 500 340 on average n 6 fig 3 much higher than typically measured in sandstone aquifers e g kipfer et al 2002 while we note that high δne can arise from sampling errors if gas bubbles are trapped in the copper sampling tubes we suggest that this is unlikely in the current case because 1 sample collection was carefully performed with high fluid pressure maintained in the cu tube 2 duplicate samples show consistent δne values 3 a high δne value in paran 20 well was also reported in a former study schuldenfrei 2010 table 1 and 4 there is a clear geographic structure in δne values throughout the study area an order of magnitude lower δne values 10 50 were observed in groundwater samples from the northern negev where recharge through the northern outcrops seems dominant groups 2 and 3 ae values are mostly lower for these northern groups 0 01 0 04 ccstp g whereas f values are higher 0 4 0 8 fig 3 for the group of samples that based on intermediate 81kr ages and δ18o values most likely represent mixtures between northern and southern source end members group 4 ae f and δne values of 0 01 0 04 ccstp g 0 1 0 4 and 70 170 were computed respectively ce model solutions with high χ2 values and low probabilities 1 were obtained for some of the samples in this group table 1 indicating an incongruent model data fit among the four noble gases yet we note that the computed model parameters i e ae f and t for these samples are all intermediate with respect to other samples with higher probabilities based on this observation it seems reasonable to assume that the ce model still produces reasonable estimates and we therefore included these samples with lower probabilities in the following discussion 5 discussion 5 1 different excess air patterns for distinct recharge areas analysis of the measured dissolved noble gas concentrations highlights that different excess air signals are recorded in the nsa the lower enrichment in ne concentrations recognized in samples from the northern parts of the aquifer groups 2 and 3 is accompanied by low kr xe ratios which are similar to the solubility ratio 7 5 at 25 c fig 4 in contrast the ne enriched samples from the southern negev group 1 are characterized by higher kr xe ratios of 9 0 the deviation of this group from the predicted kr xe solubility ratio corresponds to a shift into values that are closer to the atmospheric mole fractions ratio 13 1 such a shift is in accordance with an enhanced dissolution of entrapped air bubbles we note that previously published noble gas data from sinai abouelmagd et al 2014 included in the current discussion supplementary table b 4 display a similar relationship further strengthening our interpretation of distinct dissolved noble gas signatures as indications of different recharge sources to the nsa fig 4 elevated kr xe ratios and ne concentrations were measured in the south central sinai including in the el themed 2 and nekhel 5 wells fig 1 and lower values were obtained in the arif el naqa 2 and el hasana 3 wells located nearby or downstream from the northern sinai recharge areas hereafter defined as groups 5 and 6 respectively a striking observation is the finding of a similar dissolved noble gas signal both in the el themed 2 well which is located only 50 km from the southern outcrops in sinai fig 1 and in the southern arava valley e g yotvata t 9 well fig 2 200 km downstream of the flow path groups 5 and 1 respectively fig 4 this similarity indicates that enhanced dissolution of entrained air is a widespread phenomenon for the recharge through the southern outcrops furthermore this enhanced dissolution might have occurred during different recharge episodes the oldest episode is recorded underneath the southern negev where 81kr ages of 300 400 kyr are prevalent and 14c activity is negligible 1 pmc supplementary table b 2 while younger episode s are expected to be recorded upstream namely underneath the south central sinai even though no 81kr data is available for this part of the aquifer a somewhat higher 14c activity of 4 pmc was observed in el themed 2 abouelmagd et al 2014 indicating the presence of younger groundwater similarity in the excess air signals in groundwater that was recharged at distinct times is also observed in the northern negev including in the younger groundwater at the hazera anticline recharge area where elevated 14c activities were identified supplementary table b 2 and the older groundwater in the nearby confined section of the aquifer groups 2 and 3 respectively fig 4 furthermore the deuterium excess dex δ2h 8 δ18o signature is dissimilar between these two groups table 1 and serves as evidence for recharge under different climatic conditions ram et al 2020 yokochi et al 2019 the observation of similar excess air signals in groundwater parcels that were recharged through the same recharge areas at different times and under varying hydroclimatic conditions points to the specific hydrogeological characteristics of the recharge areas as a significant controlling factor in the entrapment and dissolution of soil air and thus the generation of excess air in groundwater 5 2 paleo water table rise as hydroclimate indicator we further interpret the ce model parameters constrained by noble gas measurements in the nsa to calculate the depth of the average water column dw eq 3 above the entrapped air bubbles we also compute dw values for the previously published noble gas data from sinai abouelmagd et al 2014 following the computation of the ce model parameters supplementary table b 3 the computed dw values fig 5 suggest that the enhanced dissolution of entrapped air in the southern recharge area represented by groups 1 and 5 has taken place under increased water head pressures of a few tens of meters lower dw values of a few meters are computed for the recharge through the northern recharge areas groups 2 3 6 and intermediate values mostly 5 10 m are obtained for the mixing group though we urge caution in interpreting the mixed samples of group 4 see section 5 4 it should be noted that the maximal water table rise might have been higher than the computed dw values as the dissolved noble gas composition reflects the dissolution of air bubbles at various depths below the water table and in addition integrates the noble gas compositions of groundwater recharged over a hundreds of square km wide recharge area and prolonged pluvial episodes e g seltzer et al 2019a stute and schlosser 1993 as further discussed below we hypothesize that the elevated dw values on the order of tens of meters represent a long term slowly rising water table to illustrate this concept we evaluate the maximal impact of annual recharge under the current climate conditions an average recharge rate of 13 106 m3 yr was estimated for the southern recharge area in sinai using the soil and water assessment tool model for the years 1998 2007 sultan et al 2011 a phreatic surface extent of 1000 km2 was evaluated for the aquifer below the recharge area jica 1999 by adopting an effective porosity of 0 1 calvo et al 2014 nativ et al 1987 we crudely estimate that the volume of annual recharge would be equivalent to a water table rise of 0 1 m if 100 of annual recharge contributed to aquifer storage practically the actual change in heads at the water table is expected to be smaller and in fact the water table would be expected to be declining under the current aridity issar et al 1972 yet this calculation gives the sense that even if precipitation amounts were doubled during former pluvial epochs e g issar and bruins 1983 such that the water table gradually rose over these intervals a long period of hundreds to thousands of years with increased recharge would be required to produce the observed dissolved noble gas signal in the nsa the process of air bubble entrainment and dissolution under a slowly rising water table is conceptually different from other classical descriptions of entrapment and dissolution under rapid water table fluctuations e g holocher et al 2002 ingram et al 2007 mächler et al 2013 it is conceivable that under a scenario in which the water table rises gradually groundwater with high dissolved gas concentrations may equilibrate via diffusion with the overlying soil air and thus the excess dissolved gas might be transferred back to the overlying soil air however if the dissolution process takes place at a considerable depth below the water table as deduced from the δne signature then diffusive re equilibration cannot occur nor can the δne anomaly be eliminated see an evaluation of the conceptual model in supplementary note a 1 conceptually a large scale water table rise is in agreement with the previously identified major mid pleistocene recharge event that was active over the southern recharge area in sinai yokochi et al 2019 currently the southern recharge area receives lower precipitation amounts compared to the northern recharge areas in the negev 50 versus 100 mm yr on average fig 1 therefore and in light of the suggested long term 106 yr hyperaridity amit et al 2011 the transition from extremely arid to somewhat wetter conditions over the southern recharge area may have resulted in a larger overall water table rise compared to characteristic water table fluctuations in the slightly less arid northern regions thus we propose that not only can the δne signal be used to identify rapid water level fluctuations following more humid conditions e g beyerle et al 2003 kulongoski et al 2004 stute and talma 1998 but it may also indicate gradual widespread rises in regional water tables this corresponds to the enhancement of the regional water budget following wetter episodes in the dry southeastern mediterranean such wetter periods were probably triggered by changes in the atmospheric circulation and synoptic conditions e g armon et al 2018 vaks et al 2006 yokochi et al 2019 orland et al 2019 5 3 the nubian rock formations a trap for small air bubbles beyond the hydroclimate context the different dissolved noble gas signals may also reflect different hydrogeological settings across the nsa s distinct recharge areas fig 6 the northern negev outcrops are scattered on top of asymmetric anticlines fig 1 with steep flanks dipping 6 90 significantly greater than the sub horizontal position 1 dip of the rocks in the southern recharge area in sinai jica 1999 zilberman 2000 the combination of the sub horizontal position and the intercalation of clays and silts within the aquifer which inefficiently reject air bubbles from the groundwater due to their lower permeability further discussed below could potentially allow significant entrapment of bubbles that dissolve as the water table rises we therefore hypothesize that the lower amounts of dissolved entrapped air in the northern recharge areas are also related to a less effective air bubble trap due to the steeper flanks efficient air bubble traps should exist in the nsa s rocks to facilitate the entrapment and dissolution process holocher et al 2002 ingram et al 2007 mächler et al 2013 indeed the aquifer is characterized by fining upward grain size sequences with low permeability layers at the top of each set barakat et al 1986 weissbrod 1993 and the prevalence of small 0 02 µm pore throats calvo et al 2014 small air bubbles which are more likely to go through a complete dissolution under smaller changes in the hydrostatic pressure holocher et al 2002 could potentially be entrapped within this small grain sub horizontal matrix moreover the narrowing of the pores and the pore throats may further facilitate the enhanced dissolution of air bubbles as a result of increased capillary pressures mercury et al 2004 thus both macro and micro scale observations support the existence of efficient air bubble traps in the nsa 5 4 derivations of the ce model parameters in the case of groundwater mixing groundwater recharge under varying hydroclimatic conditions and hydrogeological settings results in the creation of groundwater parcels with different noble gas signatures we note that mixing between two or more groundwater parcels with distinct geochemical compositions complicates the estimation of the ce model parameters from measured noble gas concentrations due to non linearity in the underlying equations of the ce model e g the temperature dependences of solubility thus direct interpretation of the physical derivations of the ce model parameters e g ae q and dw values aeschbach hertig et al 2000 ingram et al 2007 in samples highly affected by mixing such as in the case of group 4 is not advisable this argument is partially supported by ce model solutions with relatively high χ2 values and low probabilities for a few of this group s samples table 1 to illustrate how the mixing of two groundwater bodies with a different dissolved noble gas signature would behave on a δne versus f plot we use the average dissolved noble gas concentrations of groups 1 and 3 as approximations for the compositions of the two dominant end members next a mixing line between these two end members is created fig 3 based on the ce model results for synthetic groundwater samples with different mixing ratios group 4 samples generally fall close to this hypothetical mixing line we therefore caution the reader against a direct interpretation of ce model parameters for these highly mixed samples as we suspect that as formerly proposed by yokochi et al 2019 based on the 81kr dex correlation in the nsa group 4 mainly represents admixtures of groundwater derived from two recharge sources characterized by highly complete f 0 1 and moderately incomplete f 0 4 bubble dissolution rather than a single recharge source with intermediate f values 0 1 0 4 even though the latter scenario cannot be eliminated at this point 5 5 decoupling of noble gas and surface temperatures the reconstructed noble gas temperatures ngts in the nsa table 1 computed with the ce model under the conventional assumption of a closed system equilibration between water and atmospheric air at the water table range from 24 3 2 1 c to 29 6 2 2 c in the southern negev group 1 and from 24 8 2 3 c to 27 9 3 3 c in the northern negev groups 2 and 3 an exceptionally high ngt of 34 6 2 9 c was computed in the zofar 20 well for which an ascension of a very old and more saline groundwater body supplementary tables b 1 and b 2 from deeper rock formations into the nsa was suggested ram et al 2020 while the increased salinity in this well could be explained by the contribution of a small fraction a few of the total volume of brine ram et al 2020 the similarity in both the δne value and the stable isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h values to those of most nsa wells in the region group 1 in table 1 serves as evidence for earlier recharge episodes that took place under similar hydroclimatic conditions the ngt discrepancy could be explained by surplus geothermal heating due to a deeper water table i e a thicker unsaturated zone in the recharge area for the deeper rock formations noticeably the computed ngts in the negev desert groundwater are higher than the current mean annual air temperatures maat recorded by weather stations scattered over the region 18 21 c supplementary note a 2 the upward shifting of the computed ngts above the maat fig 7 is even more prominent if considering that recharge might have taken place under a colder glacial climate abouelmagd et al 2014 issar and bruins 1983 yokochi et al 2019 however it should be noted that ngt represents the ambient soil temperature at the water table at the time of recharge not of the free atmosphere in the case of the nsa the water table is mostly found at depths of hundreds of meters below the surface level and therefore the noble gas temperature is linked to the mean annual surface temperature mast which is usually several degrees higher than the air temperature in low mid latitude arid regions e g aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 beyerle et al 2003 by the prevailing geothermal gradients for further exploration and interpretation of the ngt results the current temperatures at the water table below the distinct recharge areas of the nsa were assessed first surface temperatures were evaluated using shallow a few tens of m deep observation wells over the studied region supplementary note a 2 with a concluded mast of 21 23 c and 21 25 c for the southern and the northern recharge areas respectively next the current water table depths in the phreatic zones downstream of the nsa recharge areas were evaluated an average depth of 500 700 m below surface level for the southern recharge area in sinai issar et al 1972 jica 1999 and 400 700 m for the northern recharge areas in the negev supplementary note a 3 under these settings and using a geothermal gradient of 20 25 c km 1 abdel zaher et al 2014 shalev et al 2013 2007 the current temperature at the water table below the southern recharge area in sinai is estimated to range from 31 to 40 c higher than the ngt range of 23 30 c recorded in the related paleo groundwater groups 1 and 5 fig 7 for the northern recharge areas a current water table temperature range of 29 42 c is estimated above the ngt range of 24 28 c obtained for the related groundwater clusters groups 2 and 3 thus 1 a strong decoupling of water table and surface temperatures is anticipated under the current hydrological conditions for both the southern and northern recharge areas due to the impact of the geothermal heat and 2 apparent ngts in the old groundwater are lower than the estimated current water table temperatures lower than present day recharge temperatures may serve as an indication for recharge under a climate colder than the present for instance ngt records from other aquifers located in low mid latitudes exhibit an average cooling of 6 c during the last glacial maximum e g beyerle et al 2003 kulongoski et al 2004 seltzer et al 2021b weyhenmeyer et al 2000 however the lower recharge temperatures can also represent higher paleo water heads i e shallower water tables at the recharge area resulting in reduced geothermal heating as the current water heads are not necessarily representative of those that prevailed in the system over past long term centurial to millennial pluvial periods e g schulz et al 2017 either lower maat or higher water heads could lead to the same result of lower ngt and the simultaneous quantification of both parameters is not possible with noble gas concentrations alone although it is outside the scope of this work we suggest that quantitatively deconvolving these effects may be possible through the application of a new technique to reconstruct past water table depth using dissolved kr and xe isotopes measured at high precision seltzer et al 2019b 2019a atmospheric air fractionation in the deep vadose zone the ce model results presented and discussed thus far are based on a fundamental assumption that the composition of the soil air that equilibrates with the water at the water table hundreds of meters below the surface level is similar to that of atmosphericair however fractionation and deviation from the atmospheric air composition can occur as a result of several processes most importantly gravitational settling seltzer et al 2017 severinghaus et al 1996 which may result in a relative enrichment in the concentrations of the heavier noble gases with increasing depth for instance extrapolation of the fractionation model proposed by severinghaus et al 1996 to a depth of 600 m below surface level results in an increase of 1 2 12 and 24 in the ne ar kr and xe mole fractions respectively supplementary fig c 1 namely a significant enrichment in the fractionated soil air xe and the dissolved xe accordingly is expected according to this model for a deep groundwater system such as the nsa in theory gravitational enrichment should lead to a cold ngt bias and poor goodness of fit when a traditional noble gas model is used i e one that assumes atmospheric as opposed to gravitationally enriched noble gas mixing ratios however surprisingly the kr xe signal in the ne rich samples from the southern negev group 1 related to the recharge through the deep unsaturated zone in the southern recharge area is similar to that expected from equilibrium and unfractionated excess air rather than to that of fractionated air fig 4 the gap between the predicted and observed excess air dissolution pattern might be explained by different physical mechanisms for instance paleo water tables in the southern recharge area could have been higher than they are today another possible explanation is that the unsaturated zone atmosphere in the nsa is sufficiently mixed by turbulence perhaps due to strong barometric pumping events e g scanlon et al 2002 that the full theoretical effect of gravitational settling is weakened by advection of unfractionated atmospheric air to the deep unsaturated zone further exploration of the fractionation process has vast implications for the interpretation of noble gas data in deep groundwater systems with a thick unsaturated zone but is beyond the scope of this contribution regardless of the question on fractionated or unfractionated air in a deep unsaturated zone the evidence of a high amount of excess neon remains unchanged as ne both is highly insensitive to recharge temperature owing to its weak solubility temperature dependence jenkins et al 2019 and to gravitational fractionation due to the similar molar weight of 22ne to mean air 29 g mol 1 because gravitational fractionation is proportional to the molar weight difference from mean air 22ne is 15 less sensitive to gravitational fractionation than 132xe for example 5 6 a regional overview of excess air patterns in north african aquifers the very high ne concentrations obtained for the deep sandstone aquifer of the sinai and negev deserts reaching about four times solubility equilibrium values in the most enriched groundwater samples group 1 are underappreciated yet nonunique in the region two to three times higher than solubility ne concentrations were obtained in the nubian sandstone aquifer system of the western desert in egypt patterson et al 2005 and southeast libya al faitouri 2013 as well as in the continental intercalaire sandstone aquifer in tunisia petersen et al 2018 the high ne concentrations in these desert aquifers were observed in 4he rich groundwater suggesting increased groundwater ages these observations highlight the prevalence of high excess air signals in north african sandstone aquifers that were filled during major paleorecharge events the enhanced dissolution of entrapped air bubbles is not limited to sandstone aquifers in arid regions for instance increased δne values of 150 were identified in regional sandstone aquifers located in semi arid basins such as the continental terminal and continental intercalaire in niger andrews et al 1994 beyerle et al 2003 wilson and mcneill 1997 the stampriet aquifer in namibia stute and talma 1998 and the kalahari aquifer in botswana kulongoski et al 2004 an even higher δne value of 300 was reported for a single sample from the navajo sandstone aquifer located in a semi arid basin in northern arizona zhu and kipfer 2010 in all these examples the increased δne values were related to a period of increased rain intensity thus there exists considerable global evidence that enhanced dissolution of entrapped air is a widespread phenomenon in sandstone aquifers at least in arid and semi arid regions examination of the specific hydrogeological settings in the recharge areas of each of the above mentioned groundwater systems may provide a broader perspective on the exact conditions and mechanisms under which unusually high excess air is formed and may help to improve the use of these and other aquifers as archives of past hydroclimatic conditions 6 summary and conclusions the exceptionally high dissolved noble gas concentrations in the nsa constitute evidence for large scale water table rises that occurred up to hundreds of kyr ago in this currently hyperarid region the coupling of noble gas concentrations with the 81kr dating constraints reveals a clear spatiotemporal structure of the noble gas signature and combined with the water stable isotope data further illuminates the magnitude and significance of a major recharge event that occurred in the basin under a distinct climate 360 kyr ago yokochi et al 2019 the hydroclimatic drivers are complemented by the hydrogeological settings in the southern recharge area including a sub horizontal position and sets of fining upward grains which enhance the entrapment and dissolution of air bubbles under a slowly rising water table distinct air entrapment and dissolution patterns are recorded in different parts of the nsa suggesting that the noble gas concentrations in general and the excess air signature specifically can serve as valuable tools for tracing groundwater origin and understanding past hydroclimatic changes in the recharge areas high amounts of dissolved excess air were identified in different regional aquifers located in arid and semi arid regions over the globe surprisingly we found that despite an expectation for a low excess air component in groundwater recharged through a sandstone matrix a long term water table rise in sandstone aquifers in arid regions typically characterized by a thick unsaturated vadose zone could lead to high excess air signals the entrapment and dissolution process in these arid regions is probably amplified by the intermittent very dry and somewhat wetter periods therefore we suggest that δne preserves key information about the magnitude of past water table rises and drops with insights into the natural trends in water levels and predicted changes in flow gradients such information is essential for groundwater flow modeling and resource management furthermore it provides a necessary constraint for long term hydrological changes under varying hydroclimates the fact that the highest δne values correlate with paleo groundwater over the north african continent may serve as broader evidence for the distinct pluvial climatic conditions that prevailed during past epochs over this currently hyperarid region finally the decoupling of surface and water table temperatures due to the geothermal heat of the latter is apparent in the noble gas record of a deep aquifer such as the nsa this finding emphasizes the importance of further exploration of soil air fractionation processes in the deep unsaturated zone and possible reexamination of previously obtained ngt records in other deep aquifer systems worldwide in which unsaturated zone fractionation processes and the impact of the geothermal heating of the water table were not taken into account in interpreting apparent ngts credit authorship contribution statement roi ram conceptualization formal analysis investigation project administration validation

3232,in this study a method to estimate the normal range of groundwater level time series data was developed to identify outliers in terms of the global contextual and collective sense to evaluate the normal range of groundwater level time series data the statistical characteristics of the data and the patterns of the precipitation time series data were incorporated into the lstm long short term memory based ensemble regressor i e the ler model based on the ler model multiple possible trends of the groundwater level were generated and the general rules of outlier identification methods i e σ and tukey s fences tf rules were applied to the ler ensemble estimation result to finally define the range of the normal data for outlier identification performance validation the actual groundwater level acquired from three groundwater monitoring stations in south korea i e the pohang gibuk pg namwon dotong nd and jeju sangyae js monitoring wells and the corresponding precipitation data acquired from the nearest weather stations were applied to the study as the reference method for comparative performance validation simple applications of the σ and tf rules were used for the monitoring data the developed ler based outlier identification method evaluates the range of the data that might be explained by the modelled influences of the interest i e normal data range the developed method showed an outlier identification performance of 70 in general while the performance of the σ and tf rules was mostly 50 in particular as the method effectively estimated the seasonal trend and the variability of the groundwater level with consideration of the precipitation patterns and statistics on the groundwater level variation it is superior for identifying the contextual or collective outliers compared to the simple σ and tf rules through in depth analysis it can be concluded that the developed ler based outlier identification method is effective for discriminating the abnormal data by considering the intrinsic statistical characteristics of the original data trend and the exogenous factors in the aspect of the practical applicability as the result can be automatically acquired based on real time monitoring data the developed method is expected to apply for more efficient maintenance of the monitoring devices by embedding the model as the management software into

contextual and collective outlier identification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction an outlier is an observation that deviates from other observations that are generated by a mechanism different from the mechanism of interest and the outliers are usually defined in a global contextual or collective sense for the data grubbs 1969 hawkins 1980 han et al 2012 divya and babu 2016 aggarwal 2017 lai et al 2021 audibert et al 2022 in particular to the time series data contextual outliers are the values that are not outside the global range of all data but are abnormal in a specific context for example the time series data can be anomalous in the temporal context and given the multivariate different time series datasets that relate to one another contextual outliers show the different values even in the same context for the other attribute although the individual data values might not be anomalous in global sense meanwhile collective outliers are a group of anomalous points but each individual point is globally normal in this sense lai et al 2021 have defined the collective outlier as a pattern showing different behaviors in the same context especially for the time series data identifying outliers has a wide range of applications including cyber intrusion detection fraud detection and data cleaning hodge and austin 2004 groundwater level time series data are important information sources for modeling various physical and chemical phenomena of the aquifer and for surveillance of the soundness of the groundwater system in the sense of groundwater quantity and quality conservation taylor and alley 2001 while monitoring the data several types of outliers with various causes might occur such as malfunction of the monitoring device erroneous transmission or transcription which cause significant quality deterioration in the groundwater system modeling conducted using the data meanwhile the abnormal changes of physical chemical conditions of the groundwater system might be inspected by the outliers in the monitoring data which can be non negligible information for examining the unusual situation e g groundwater contamination groundwater drought and change of groundwater quantity according to artificial pumping as such outlier identification in groundwater time series data is a crucial process for improving the efficiency of either the monitoring device maintenance or the detection of anomalous changes in the groundwater system the groundwater level is the data with a seasonal dependency and relationship with the meteorological time series data for example precipitation and evapotranspiration rates therefore there would be a greater need for a contextual sense of outlier identification there have been numerous studies that identified outliers through several methods of graphical and statistical tests or with machine learning ml for example tukey 1977 proposed a statistical approach based on the quartile of the data and chang et al 1988 proposed the use of the likelihood ratio test in particular for groundwater time series measurements robust regression methods that are less affected by outliers have been employed as main trend estimators rousseeuw 1984 rousseeuw and leroy 1987 gibbons 1994 helsel and hirsch 2002 in which the theil sen estimator the least median of squares or least trimmed squares lts are frequent options as another approach using a robust regressor for outlier detection in time series measurements jeong et al 2017 proposed an ensemble regressor applying subsample aggregating subagging resampling and the lts method relevant studies showed that the outliers in the time series data were efficiently assessed based on the estimated main trend through the application of the robust regressors helsel and hirsch 2002 jeong et al 2017 however those regressors were based on univariate regression and therefore it is difficult to assess contextual outliers considering the variability of the exogenous variables for example although the distinct decline of groundwater level as a result of exceptionally low precipitation is a natural physical process of the groundwater system the monitoring data would be identified as outliers by the conventional regressors such as jeong et al 2017 in addition the conventional methods i e theil sen estimator least median of squares lts and regressor in jeong et al 2017 are only effective for understanding the seasonal trend of the groundwater level the accuracy of identifying outliers might be lower than when the exogenous factors are considered an exact regression method such as ml based regression can improve the outlier identification accuracy with the continuous growth of data science technologies in recent decades ml based outlier identification research for groundwater time series monitoring data have also increased most existing ml based methods are based on a similarity search between the data points using density based clustering and the ml based regression for instance k means clustering methods can be used to detect point outliers in a global view chawla and gionis 2013 a specific value of the groundwater level time series data estimated by various ml methods can be used as a reference for identifying the outliers jeong and park 2019 jeong et al 2020 kieu et al 2018 the ml based methods are particularly favorable in terms of identifying the contextual or collective outliers considering the exogeneous variable and seasonal autocorrelation of the time series data malhotra et al 2016 park et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 although ml has been successfully used to estimate the trend of groundwater level a majority of ml applications were proposed for deterministic estimation that can be inadequate to contemplate the uncertainty of the applied data jeong and park 2019 bontempi et al 2013 the values can be incorrectly identified as outliers when the data are highly variable for certain reasons e g permissible technical error in monitoring tide effect which can be compensated by an ensemble of multiple estimations considering the intrinsic variability of the normal data in typical conditions it is frequently reported that applying ensembles improves the estimation accuracy brown et al 2005 and multiple estimation results help to define the range of the normal data the upper and lower limits of the normal data are both evaluated by the interquartile range iqr or standard deviation of the data hodge and austin 2004 but the measures are limited to detect outliers regardless of seasonal variation or exogenous variables therefore further development of a method to join the ensemble method and the ml based regressor is needed to effectively assess the range of the normal data and identify the outliers in terms of global contextual and collective views the main purpose of this study is to develop an effective ensemble regressor for groundwater level time series data that efficiently detects the contextual or collective outliers by assessing the range of the normal data this study considered the data that is separated from the majority of the other data following the main trend as the outlier while the outlier identification performance of the developed method in terms of the global contextual and collective sense is improved by considering the statistical characteristics seasonal variation of the data and exogenous factors in the development a deep learning model applying the ensemble estimation technique was newly proposed for evaluating the multiple possible trends of the data as a deep learning model long short term memory lstm which is a neural network model developed for time series data estimation by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 was adopted to effectively incorporate the historical trend of the data the trend estimation performance of the long short term memory based ensemble regressor ler was validated using the actual groundwater level time series data acquired from three monitoring stations in the south korea national groundwater monitoring network kngmn the outlier identification performance of the proposed method based on the ler estimation results was compared with the simple outlier identification methods i e σ and tf rules 2 materials and methodology 2 1 applied data the developed ler method is applied to three groundwater monitoring locations 1 the pohang gibuk well in pohang of gyeongsang province pg 2 the namwon dotong well in namwon of jeonbook province nd and 3 the jeju sangyae well in sangyae of jeju island js of south korea fig 1 and the ler method applicability for identifying the outliers was comparatively validated the daily groundwater level and the precipitation rate time series data were acquired from the kngmn operated by the national water resources management company k water and weather stations of the national meteorological observational network operated by the korea meteorological administration respectively further details of the applied data for each site follow 2 1 1 pohang gibuk pg monitoring well the pg well is located in the southeastern part of the korean peninsula the surroundings are dominantly composed of mountains and agricultural land and a 20 m wide stream is within 150 m of the monitoring well a total of 11 years from 2005 to 2014 of groundwater level and precipitation time series data was applied to the study fig 2 a table 1 shows the statistics of the groundwater level applied in this study the mean groundwater level is 116 32 m above mean sea level msl and the standard deviation over the 11 year period is 0 63 m which is calculated using the residuals considering the seasonal variation of the data calculated via linear regression using a combination of trigonometric functions as shown in fig 2 a and table 1 the groundwater level of the pg well shows a drastic daily fluctuation average difference of the daily groundwater level is 0 35 m unfortunately it was difficult to find a clear reason for the drastic daily fluctuation pattern however the pattern can be judged to be normal data under the ordinary physical groundwater system of the area because it is consistently observed during the entire monitoring period the ground surface of the station is 121 11 m above msl therefore the depth of the groundwater level is approximately 4 79 m the well is drilled to 70 m below the surface and the upper aquifer is mostly composed of unconsolidated sedimentary rock medium grain sand to gravel while semi consolidated or consolidated shale forms the lower aquifer below 9 m depth https www gims go kr approximately 58 72 of annual precipitation is concentrated during the summer june august over the 11 year period in the area the mean and standard deviation table 2 of the daily precipitation rate were 2 97 mm and 10 13 mm respectively and the corresponding values for the annual total precipitation were 1085 90 mm and 204 38 mm respectively table 2 2 1 2 namwon dotong nd monitoring well the nd well is located in namwon city with an 80 m wide river within a 300 m radius daily groundwater level and precipitation time series data from 2004 to 2014 were used in the study the variation trend of the data and the statistics are presented in fig 2 b and table 1 respectively the mean of the groundwater level in the region is 105 47 m above the msl and the surface elevation is 112 m indicating that the average thickness of the unsaturated zone is approximately 7 m the groundwater observation well was drilled to a depth of 70 m below the surface the upper part of the aquifer comprises fine grained silty sand and sandy gravel from 0 m to 6 m below the borehole surface and the lower part of the aquifer from 6 m to 26 m comprises weathered biotite granite the deeper part of the aquifer comprises biotite granite hard rock gims 1998 compared with the pg monitoring well the groundwater level data of the nd monitoring well did not show significant daily fluctuations the annual change of maximum and minimum groundwater level is observed to be less than 1 5 m which is a relatively narrow fluctuation range compared with that of the pg well 5 8 m the mean and standard deviation of the daily precipitation for 11 years were 3 72 mm and 13 01 mm respectively and the mean and standard deviation of the annual total precipitation were 1357 72 mm and 247 83 mm respectively table 2 2 1 3 jeju sangyae js monitoring well the js well is located on the biggest island of the korean peninsula jeju island which was formed by volcanic activity that started 2 million years ago the aquifers consist of numerous types of igneous rocks e g acicular basalt olivine basalt feldspar pyroxene coarse basalt and coarse basalt consisting of various volcanic structures woo et al 2013 because of the high permeability of the island i e the scoria sediments and the joints of volcanic rocks streams are developed only during the rainy period and therefore the majority of the water resources more than 90 of the island comprises groundwater won et al 2006 however it is difficult to identify the depth of the aquifer because of the relatively complex volcanic origin of the island including vertical cracks and clinker layers in many locations hahn et al 1997 the js well is surrounded by agricultural lands and it is difficult to find a source of surface water supply in the area fig 2 c shows the daily fluctuation pattern of the applied groundwater level and precipitation time series data acquired from 2010 to 2020 the average groundwater level is 54 81 m and the surface elevation is 160 m therefore the unsaturated zone of the area is formed with 105 19 m of thickness because the groundwater level in the js well is continuously decreasing and the precipitation amount is also highly variable with time it is difficult to evaluate the range of the normal data in response to the precipitation amount because of its climatic characteristics jeju island shows relatively a higher precipitation amount than inland areas the mean and standard deviation of the daily precipitation for 11 years were 4 78 mm and 16 43 mm respectively and the mean and standard deviation of the annual total precipitation were 1748 63 mm and 398 97 mm respectively table 2 2 2 ler for groundwater level estimation 2 2 1 training the trend of groundwater level many factors such as precipitation evaporation surface water levels and irrigation can be influential in groundwater level fluctuation but in this study recharge from precipitation was considered a dominant factor in changing groundwater levels it is reported that the amount of the past precipitation whether a few hours or a few years can contribute to recharge lee et al 2014 jasechko et al 2014 gong et al 2012 which implies that the past precipitation trend needs to be incorporated in the groundwater level estimation in this study lstm was adopted as a regressor estimating the groundwater level lstm often has been adopted to explain temporal changes in time series data over long periods jeong and park 2019 siami namini et al 2018 given that the t sequential groundwater level time series measurements h h 1 h t t response variable and the corresponding l types of meteorological

lstm based ensemble estimation as randomly selected subsamples can contain statistical variability of the data that is likely to represent the population resampling based ensemble approaches can increase the estimation diversity which can improve the prediction accuracy brown et al 2005 and effectively represent the statistical variability of the data jeong et al 2021 therefore in this study during the estimation from the lstm network d subestimations were generated by using a limited number m s of the resampled data from the input data m without replacement m s m where the resampled data is randomly chosen fig 3 and the d results are aggregated based on the concept of bagging breiman 1996 the value of d is set to be sufficiently large to keep a statistical consistency in the

brief explanations of the applied methods are introduced in this manuscript but more details can be found in ruan et al 2005 for the σ rule and in tukey 1977 for the tf rule the σ rule identifies outliers based on the standard deviation of the data distribution where the upper and lower limits at the t th time step are designated by s up t μ t a σ t and s lw t μ t a σ t respectively in the

q r t where iqr is the interquartile range that is equal to q 3 t q 1 t in the same manner as in the σ rule the observations in the range of f lw t f up t are counted as the normal data it is well known that the tf rule is more appropriate for data with non gaussian distribution compared to the σ rule li wen 2011 zhang 2016 and the values of k 1 5 and a 2 689 for the tf rule and the σ rule respectively show similar normal data ranges in this study k 1 5 and a 3 were applied for the tf and σ rules respectively i e 0 7 and 0 27 outliers for each method 3 results and discussion 3 1 ler model training the ler model was trained using python v 3 7 https www python org with the keras library v 2 3 1 https keras io two intel xeon gold 6240 2 6 ghz 3 9 ghz turbo 18 cores hardware with 64 gb of memory and four nvidia quadro p400 with 2 gb for the gpu and ms windows 10 pro 4 core plus operating system for training the model 70 of the total data green shading box in fig 2 was used for each study area january 1 2005 august 31 2012 for pg well january 1 2004 august 31 2011 for nd well and january 1 2010 august 31 2017 for js well the rest of the data 30 of the total orange shading box in fig 2 were used as the testing data september 1 2012 december 31 2015 for pg well september 1 2011 december 31 2014 for nd well and september 1 2017 december 31 2020 for js well the applied lstm network was set up differently for each study area and the applied parameters are summarized in supplementary material for each model development the root mean squared error rmse between the actual and the estimated groundwater level was applied as the cost function to find the optimal hyperparameters systematical experiments have been conducted e g grid search and early stopping method was consistently applied to avoid overfitting fig 4 shows the groundwater level estimation results according to the precipitation blue bars using the training ler model for the testing period in the figure the black dots indicate the actual groundwater level data the red solid line is the mean level of the ensemble result and the yellow and gray shading represent 50 and 99 of the estimated ensemble result respectively as shown in the figure the estimated range of groundwater level covers the majority of the actual groundwater level fluctuations the decreasing pattern of the groundwater level according to the low precipitation amount is reasonably estimated based on the developed ler model in particular a relatively wide range of estimations is observed for the pg and js wells compared to that of the nd well which indicates that the ler model can reasonably evaluate the actual variation of daily groundwater level by considering the standard deviation of the groundwater level for each monitoring well high standard deviation values for the pg and js wells but low values for the nd well in table 1 meanwhile even though the range of the estimated ensemble is relatively wider than the results of other wells a relatively higher amount of the actual groundwater level of pg well is outside of the range of 50 of the ensemble compared to the other wells fig 4 a this is caused by the exogenous factors else precipitation that affect the groundwater level of pg well the developed estimation model solely based on the precipitation as the explanatory variable assessed that those variabilities could be outliers a quantitative performance evaluation was implemented by calculating the rmse and correlation coefficient cc between the actual and the estimated mean level of groundwater the results of which are represented in table 3 the validation results for the pg and js wells are relatively lower than those for the nd well which is a result of the highly variable daily fluctuations for the pg well and the outliers deviated from the main trend of the actual data for the js well all the results produced a low rmse less than 1 m and high cc value very strong correlation between the estimation of the ler model and actual data 3 2 validation of the outlier identification performance of the ler method in practice it is difficult to isolate the outliers from the actual field data despite the fact that the data contain the real outliers therefore in this study the outlier identification performance of the developed method was validated based on the hypothetically generated outliers for the testing data i e no outliers in the training dataset ten percent of the total groundwater level data were randomly selected and replaced by hypothetical outliers that were generated from a continuous uniform distribution with a range from v to v u v v where v max g l min g l in figs 5 7 the black dots are the actual groundwater level data whereas the red dots represent the generated hypothetical outliers some parts of the generated outliers are very close to the actual data as the outliers were generated by applying the continuous uniform distribution but the majority of the outliers tend to show significant differences from the actual values in this study the outlier identification methods of σ and tf rules were applied as the reference methods for performance validation of the developed model based on the generated hypothetical outliers figs 5 7 include the outlier identification results using the σ and tf rules and developed method in the figures a and b show the results of applying the σ and tf rules and the developed ler based outlier identification method respectively the blue and green solid lines indicate the boundaries of the normal data evaluated from the σ and tf rules respectively the red circles with the cross symbols indicate the hypothesized outliers evaluated as outliers in the results the red circles with the diamond symbol are misclassifications of the hypothesized outliers as normal data for all the monitoring well results applying both σ and tf rules showed similar outlier identification performances additionally the seasonal trends of the groundwater level data cannot be considered through the σ and tf rules figs 5 7 a which results in significant underestimation of the hypothesized outliers this fact can be confirmed by the quantity of data indicated by the red circles with the diamond symbol in the figure conversely as the developed ler model reasonably estimates the seasonal variations and the variability of daily fluctuations of the actual groundwater level data by considering the precipitation the majority of the hypothesized outliers were effectively discriminated from the actual groundwater level data therefore the number of misclassifications the red dots with the diamond symbol is remarkably smaller than the number from the σ and tf rules further comparative quantitative performance validation for the developed ler based outlier identification method is examined the results of which are in given in table 4 the table shows the number of correct classifications and misclassifications identification and the identification success percentage identification of the applied methods for the hypothesized outliers as summarized in the table the developed ler model is suitable for identifying the outliers by showing high outlier identification success percentages generally higher than 70 while the majority of success rates for the σ and tf rules are lower than 50 especially for the js monitoring well results as the seasonal variability of the groundwater level data is relatively high and the abnormal data from the 2020 year are included the normal data ranges evaluated from the σ and tf rules are considerably wide in turn the success percentages of those methods deteriorate to 18 00 and 10 61 respectively unlike the σ and tf rules the developed ler based outlier identification methods still show high identification success percentages 76 31 and 76 12 respectively the superiority of the developed method was additionally confirmed by analyzing its appropriateness for misclassified outliers the red circles with the diamond symbol in figs 5 7 fig 8 shows comparisons between histograms for the absolute value of differences between the actual groundwater level data black dots in figs 5 7 and hypothesized outliers successfully identified as outliers the red dots with cross symbols in figs 5 7 as well as for the absolute value of differences between the actual groundwater level data and hypothesized outliers identified as the normal data the red dots with diamond symbol in figs 5 7 which are represented with red and green bars in the figure respectively the differences between the values were calculated based on the tf rule results because the results of both the σ and tf rules are similar comparing the results for the tf rules and the developed method the histograms for the developed method the green bars in fig 8 a 2 b 2 and c 2 are distributed in a relatively small range compared to those for the tf rules the green bars in fig 9 a 1 b 1 and c 1 in addition statistical differences between the red and green bars in the case of the developed ler based outlier identification method fig 8 a 2 b 2 and c 2 are more evident compared to the tf rules results fig 8 a 1 b 1 and c 1 the results indicate that the misclassified outliers were similar to the actual data because the outliers were generated close to the actual data by using random values from the continuous uniform distribution i e the misclassified hypothesized outliers can be considered as normal data therefore the misclassified data as the normal but hypothesized outliers in the actual are likely to be evaluated as the normal data because those data are closed to the actual normal data which indicates that the performance of the developed method would be better than the results expected in table 4 3 3 results of identifying the outliers in the actual groundwater level time series data to verify the practical applicability of the developed ler based outlier identification method performance validation on the actual groundwater level monitoring data including the abnormal data that is not explained by the main trend of the groundwater level was carried out as shown in fig 2 c an abrupt decline in groundwater level data unrelated to the precipitation pattern was observed during the period from june 30 2020 to july 13 2020 at the js well the red box it could be caused via a temporary malfunction of the groundwater level monitoring device meanwhile it could be a result of excessive groundwater pumping but because the amount of the pumping for agricultural activities had not been recorded as there is no legal obligation for recording it is very difficult to conclude applying the σ and tf rules outlier identification method it is difficult to identify the data in the red box as an outlier in terms of the global view of the groundwater level data because it occurred within the actual data range however through the ler based outlier identification method that can estimate the seasonal trends and daily variability according to the precipitation the outliers were effectively discriminated from the normal data which is well represented in fig 9 in the figure the black dots indicate the actual groundwater level data the red solid line is the ensemble mean the yellow and gray shading represent 50 and 99 of the ensemble results estimated from the ler model respectively the blue bar is the precipitation the green solid line is the normal data boundary evaluated by applying the tf rule to the ensemble estimation and the red dots with the cross symbol indicate the identified outliers as shown in the figure the evaluated normal data range uncovers the outliers that is not explained by modelled influences i e precipitation in the red box even though the individual data of both precipitation and groundwater level data are not anomalous in the global sense considering the minimum and maximum value of the data this result indicates that the development of this study has a practical application in terms of identifying outliers in a contextual and collective sense by applying the variational trends of groundwater level ensemble estimations corresponding to precipitation patterns 4 discussion considering that the importance of surveillance using monitoring data is likely to increase for sustainable groundwater development with respect to groundwater quantity and quality the necessity of an effective method for securing sound data quality is indisputable the developed ler based outlier identification method is effective at discriminating the abnormal data with the consideration of the intrinsic statistical characteristics of the original data trend and exogenous factors that can affect the groundwater system comparing the applicability of the developed ler model to the process based groundwater level estimation model jeong and park 2017 jeong et al 2018 zaadnoordijk et al 2019 the ler model is based on a data driven model using a deep learning method which has the benefit of no requirement on a priori information for example the ler model has not assumed the physical model related to groundwater flow the distribution function of the interest factors and model parameters etc while a more realistic estimation can be made by applying the relationship between the actual data patterns in addition there is no limit on the types of exogenous factors that are applied to develop the ler model furthermore the automatic outlier identification based on the ler model estimation results would be useful to improve the efficiency of the inspection of the groundwater monitoring data which has been manually performed in general e g retike et al 2022 after processing the discriminated data as the outliers can be applied to various tasks for example 1 monitoring device malfunction detection 2 increasing groundwater flow model calibration performance by cleaning the noisy groundwater level data 3 assessment of decreasing or increasing groundwater level pattern irrelevant to the precipitation pattern 4 surveillance on groundwater pumping etc especially because the result can be automatically acquired based on real time monitoring data it is expected that more efficient maintenance of the monitoring devices will be feasible by embedding the development as the management software into the monitoring network system although the method proposed in this study was developed for using daily time series data the method can be easily expanded to apply the data with different frequencies e g hourly data but all the applied time series data must have the same time frequency to guarantee a sufficient estimation accuracy of the ler model at least one year of time series data including the whole seasonal variational trend of the meteorological and groundwater time series data would be recommended the exact length of the data required by the data driven model is highly dependent on the applied data and therefore several tests with respect to the data must be needed grid search can be recommended during the training the method proposed in this study is limited to the application when the training data are not highly variated by the data that is generated by other exogenous factors not having an interest but it can be overcome by applying the robust regression methods to the outliers e g lts or smoother techniques to develop the regression model jeong et al 2020 5 conclusions in this study a method to estimate the range of the normal groundwater level data was developed to identify outliers in terms of the global contextual and collective senses the normal data range was evaluated in consideration of the statistical characteristics of the data and the pattern of the precipitation time series data by the development of the lstm based ensemble regressor for groundwater level time series data i e the ler model that can estimate the multiple possible trends of the groundwater level the general rules of outlier identification methods i e σ and tf rules were applied to the ler ensemble estimation results to define the range of the normal data for additional practical outlier identification performance validation the actual groundwater level and precipitation data acquired from three groundwater monitoring stations and the corresponding nearest weather stations of south korea were applied to this study comparative performance validation with respect to the simple σ and tf rules were performed for all the monitoring data the developed ler based groundwater level estimation model is effective for estimating the seasonal trend and the variability of the groundwater level with consideration of precipitation patterns and the statistics on the groundwater level variations in addition the range of the normal data was properly evaluated by applying the σ and tf outlier identification rules to the ler ensemble estimation results in particular the superiority of the developed method for identifying the contextual or collective outliers can be confirmed because the proposed outlier identification method can effectively detect values that are abnormal in the context of the seasonal and precipitation patterns credit authorship

3232,in this study a method to estimate the normal range of groundwater level time series data was developed to identify outliers in terms of the global contextual and collective sense to evaluate the normal range of groundwater level time series data the statistical characteristics of the data and the patterns of the precipitation time series data were incorporated into the lstm long short term memory based ensemble regressor i e the ler model based on the ler model multiple possible trends of the groundwater level were generated and the general rules of outlier identification methods i e σ and tukey s fences tf rules were applied to the ler ensemble estimation result to finally define the range of the normal data for outlier identification performance validation the actual groundwater level acquired from three groundwater monitoring stations in south korea i e the pohang gibuk pg namwon dotong nd and jeju sangyae js monitoring wells and the corresponding precipitation data acquired from the nearest weather stations were applied to the study as the reference method for comparative performance validation simple applications of the σ and tf rules were used for the monitoring data the developed ler based outlier identification method evaluates the range of the data that might be explained by the modelled influences of the interest i e normal data range the developed method showed an outlier identification performance of 70 in general while the performance of the σ and tf rules was mostly 50 in particular as the method effectively estimated the seasonal trend and the variability of the groundwater level with consideration of the precipitation patterns and statistics on the groundwater level variation it is superior for identifying the contextual or collective outliers compared to the simple σ and tf rules through in depth analysis it can be concluded that the developed ler based outlier identification method is effective for discriminating the abnormal data by considering the intrinsic statistical characteristics of the original data trend and the exogenous factors in the aspect of the practical applicability as the result can be automatically acquired based on real time monitoring data the developed method is expected to apply for more efficient maintenance of the monitoring devices by embedding the model as the management software into

contextual and collective outlier identification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction an outlier is an observation that deviates from other observations that are generated by a mechanism different from the mechanism of interest and the outliers are usually defined in a global contextual or collective sense for the data grubbs 1969 hawkins 1980 han et al 2012 divya and babu 2016 aggarwal 2017 lai et al 2021 audibert et al 2022 in particular to the time series data contextual outliers are the values that are not outside the global range of all data but are abnormal in a specific context for example the time series data can be anomalous in the temporal context and given the multivariate different time series datasets that relate to one another contextual outliers show the different values even in the same context for the other attribute although the individual data values might not be anomalous in global sense meanwhile collective outliers are a group of anomalous points but each individual point is globally normal in this sense lai et al 2021 have defined the collective outlier as a pattern showing different behaviors in the same context especially for the time series data identifying outliers has a wide range of applications including cyber intrusion detection fraud detection and data cleaning hodge and austin 2004 groundwater level time series data are important information sources for modeling various physical and chemical phenomena of the aquifer and for surveillance of the soundness of the groundwater system in the sense of groundwater quantity and quality conservation taylor and alley 2001 while monitoring the data several types of outliers with various causes might occur such as malfunction of the monitoring device erroneous transmission or transcription which cause significant quality deterioration in the groundwater system modeling conducted using the data meanwhile the abnormal changes of physical chemical conditions of the groundwater system might be inspected by the outliers in the monitoring data which can be non negligible information for examining the unusual situation e g groundwater contamination groundwater drought and change of groundwater quantity according to artificial pumping as such outlier identification in groundwater time series data is a crucial process for improving the efficiency of either the monitoring device maintenance or the detection of anomalous changes in the groundwater system the groundwater level is the data with a seasonal dependency and relationship with the meteorological time series data for example precipitation and evapotranspiration rates therefore there would be a greater need for a contextual sense of outlier identification there have been numerous studies that identified outliers through several methods of graphical and statistical tests or with machine learning ml for example tukey 1977 proposed a statistical approach based on the quartile of the data and chang et al 1988 proposed the use of the likelihood ratio test in particular for groundwater time series measurements robust regression methods that are less affected by outliers have been employed as main trend estimators rousseeuw 1984 rousseeuw and leroy 1987 gibbons 1994 helsel and hirsch 2002 in which the theil sen estimator the least median of squares or least trimmed squares lts are frequent options as another approach using a robust regressor for outlier detection in time series measurements jeong et al 2017 proposed an ensemble regressor applying subsample aggregating subagging resampling and the lts method relevant studies showed that the outliers in the time series data were efficiently assessed based on the estimated main trend through the application of the robust regressors helsel and hirsch 2002 jeong et al 2017 however those regressors were based on univariate regression and therefore it is difficult to assess contextual outliers considering the variability of the exogenous variables for example although the distinct decline of groundwater level as a result of exceptionally low precipitation is a natural physical process of the groundwater system the monitoring data would be identified as outliers by the conventional regressors such as jeong et al 2017 in addition the conventional methods i e theil sen estimator least median of squares lts and regressor in jeong et al 2017 are only effective for understanding the seasonal trend of the groundwater level the accuracy of identifying outliers might be lower than when the exogenous factors are considered an exact regression method such as ml based regression can improve the outlier identification accuracy with the continuous growth of data science technologies in recent decades ml based outlier identification research for groundwater time series monitoring data have also increased most existing ml based methods are based on a similarity search between the data points using density based clustering and the ml based regression for instance k means clustering methods can be used to detect point outliers in a global view chawla and gionis 2013 a specific value of the groundwater level time series data estimated by various ml methods can be used as a reference for identifying the outliers jeong and park 2019 jeong et al 2020 kieu et al 2018 the ml based methods are particularly favorable in terms of identifying the contextual or collective outliers considering the exogeneous variable and seasonal autocorrelation of the time series data malhotra et al 2016 park et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 although ml has been successfully used to estimate the trend of groundwater level a majority of ml applications were proposed for deterministic estimation that can be inadequate to contemplate the uncertainty of the applied data jeong and park 2019 bontempi et al 2013 the values can be incorrectly identified as outliers when the data are highly variable for certain reasons e g permissible technical error in monitoring tide effect which can be compensated by an ensemble of multiple estimations considering the intrinsic variability of the normal data in typical conditions it is frequently reported that applying ensembles improves the estimation accuracy brown et al 2005 and multiple estimation results help to define the range of the normal data the upper and lower limits of the normal data are both evaluated by the interquartile range iqr or standard deviation of the data hodge and austin 2004 but the measures are limited to detect outliers regardless of seasonal variation or exogenous variables therefore further development of a method to join the ensemble method and the ml based regressor is needed to effectively assess the range of the normal data and identify the outliers in terms of global contextual and collective views the main purpose of this study is to develop an effective ensemble regressor for groundwater level time series data that efficiently detects the contextual or collective outliers by assessing the range of the normal data this study considered the data that is separated from the majority of the other data following the main trend as the outlier while the outlier identification performance of the developed method in terms of the global contextual and collective sense is improved by considering the statistical characteristics seasonal variation of the data and exogenous factors in the development a deep learning model applying the ensemble estimation technique was newly proposed for evaluating the multiple possible trends of the data as a deep learning model long short term memory lstm which is a neural network model developed for time series data estimation by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 was adopted to effectively incorporate the historical trend of the data the trend estimation performance of the long short term memory based ensemble regressor ler was validated using the actual groundwater level time series data acquired from three monitoring stations in the south korea national groundwater monitoring network kngmn the outlier identification performance of the proposed method based on the ler estimation results was compared with the simple outlier identification methods i e σ and tf rules 2 materials and methodology 2 1 applied data the developed ler method is applied to three groundwater monitoring locations 1 the pohang gibuk well in pohang of gyeongsang province pg 2 the namwon dotong well in namwon of jeonbook province nd and 3 the jeju sangyae well in sangyae of jeju island js of south korea fig 1 and the ler method applicability for identifying the outliers was comparatively validated the daily groundwater level and the precipitation rate time series data were acquired from the kngmn operated by the national water resources management company k water and weather stations of the national meteorological observational network operated by the korea meteorological administration respectively further details of the applied data for each site follow 2 1 1 pohang gibuk pg monitoring well the pg well is located in the southeastern part of the korean peninsula the surroundings are dominantly composed of mountains and agricultural land and a 20 m wide stream is within 150 m of the monitoring well a total of 11 years from 2005 to 2014 of groundwater level and precipitation time series data was applied to the study fig 2 a table 1 shows the statistics of the groundwater level applied in this study the mean groundwater level is 116 32 m above mean sea level msl and the standard deviation over the 11 year period is 0 63 m which is calculated using the residuals considering the seasonal variation of the data calculated via linear regression using a combination of trigonometric functions as shown in fig 2 a and table 1 the groundwater level of the pg well shows a drastic daily fluctuation average difference of the daily groundwater level is 0 35 m unfortunately it was difficult to find a clear reason for the drastic daily fluctuation pattern however the pattern can be judged to be normal data under the ordinary physical groundwater system of the area because it is consistently observed during the entire monitoring period the ground surface of the station is 121 11 m above msl therefore the depth of the groundwater level is approximately 4 79 m the well is drilled to 70 m below the surface and the upper aquifer is mostly composed of unconsolidated sedimentary rock medium grain sand to gravel while semi consolidated or consolidated shale forms the lower aquifer below 9 m depth https www gims go kr approximately 58 72 of annual precipitation is concentrated during the summer june august over the 11 year period in the area the mean and standard deviation table 2 of the daily precipitation rate were 2 97 mm and 10 13 mm respectively and the corresponding values for the annual total precipitation were 1085 90 mm and 204 38 mm respectively table 2 2 1 2 namwon dotong nd monitoring well the nd well is located in namwon city with an 80 m wide river within a 300 m radius daily groundwater level and precipitation time series data from 2004 to 2014 were used in the study the variation trend of the data and the statistics are presented in fig 2 b and table 1 respectively the mean of the groundwater level in the region is 105 47 m above the msl and the surface elevation is 112 m indicating that the average thickness of the unsaturated zone is approximately 7 m the groundwater observation well was drilled to a depth of 70 m below the surface the upper part of the aquifer comprises fine grained silty sand and sandy gravel from 0 m to 6 m below the borehole surface and the lower part of the aquifer from 6 m to 26 m comprises weathered biotite granite the deeper part of the aquifer comprises biotite granite hard rock gims 1998 compared with the pg monitoring well the groundwater level data of the nd monitoring well did not show significant daily fluctuations the annual change of maximum and minimum groundwater level is observed to be less than 1 5 m which is a relatively narrow fluctuation range compared with that of the pg well 5 8 m the mean and standard deviation of the daily precipitation for 11 years were 3 72 mm and 13 01 mm respectively and the mean and standard deviation of the annual total precipitation were 1357 72 mm and 247 83 mm respectively table 2 2 1 3 jeju sangyae js monitoring well the js well is located on the biggest island of the korean peninsula jeju island which was formed by volcanic activity that started 2 million years ago the aquifers consist of numerous types of igneous rocks e g acicular basalt olivine basalt feldspar pyroxene coarse basalt and coarse basalt consisting of various volcanic structures woo et al 2013 because of the high permeability of the island i e the scoria sediments and the joints of volcanic rocks streams are developed only during the rainy period and therefore the majority of the water resources more than 90 of the island comprises groundwater won et al 2006 however it is difficult to identify the depth of the aquifer because of the relatively complex volcanic origin of the island including vertical cracks and clinker layers in many locations hahn et al 1997 the js well is surrounded by agricultural lands and it is difficult to find a source of surface water supply in the area fig 2 c shows the daily fluctuation pattern of the applied groundwater level and precipitation time series data acquired from 2010 to 2020 the average groundwater level is 54 81 m and the surface elevation is 160 m therefore the unsaturated zone of the area is formed with 105 19 m of thickness because the groundwater level in the js well is continuously decreasing and the precipitation amount is also highly variable with time it is difficult to evaluate the range of the normal data in response to the precipitation amount because of its climatic characteristics jeju island shows relatively a higher precipitation amount than inland areas the mean and standard deviation of the daily precipitation for 11 years were 4 78 mm and 16 43 mm respectively and the mean and standard deviation of the annual total precipitation were 1748 63 mm and 398 97 mm respectively table 2 2 2 ler for groundwater level estimation 2 2 1 training the trend of groundwater level many factors such as precipitation evaporation surface water levels and irrigation can be influential in groundwater level fluctuation but in this study recharge from precipitation was considered a dominant factor in changing groundwater levels it is reported that the amount of the past precipitation whether a few hours or a few years can contribute to recharge lee et al 2014 jasechko et al 2014 gong et al 2012 which implies that the past precipitation trend needs to be incorporated in the groundwater level estimation in this study lstm was adopted as a regressor estimating the groundwater level lstm often has been adopted to explain temporal changes in time series data over long periods jeong and park 2019 siami namini et al 2018 given that the t sequential groundwater level time series measurements h h 1 h t t response variable and the corresponding l types of meteorological

activation function ϕ where the hyperbolic tangent function sigmoid function rectified linear unit relu or exponential linear unit elu were selectively adopted for each test case in this study 2 2 2 lstm based ensemble estimation as randomly selected subsamples can contain statistical variability of the data that is likely to represent the population resampling based ensemble approaches can increase the estimation diversity which can improve the prediction accuracy brown et al 2005 and effectively represent the statistical variability of the data jeong et al 2021 therefore in this study during the estimation from the lstm network d subestimations were generated by using a limited number m s of the resampled data from the input data m without replacement m s m where the resampled data is randomly chosen fig 3 and the d results are aggregated based on the concept of bagging breiman 1996 the value of d is set to be sufficiently large to keep a statistical consistency in the subestimations more details on using ler to estimate groundwater level at the t th time step correspond to the following pseudocode 1 while d d 1 1 randomly select m s m subsamples from the

above the estimated ensemble at the t th time step y t is composed of d subestimations the upper and lower limits of the normal data are evaluated by the sigma σ and tukey s fences tf rules to y t brief explanations of the applied methods are introduced in this manuscript but more details can be found in ruan et al 2005 for the σ rule and in tukey 1977 for the tf rule the σ rule identifies outliers based on the standard deviation of the data distribution where the upper and lower limits at the t th time step are designated by s up t μ t a σ t and s lw t μ t a σ t respectively in the limits μ t and σ t indicate the mean and standard deviation of the d subestimations at the t th time step y t the t th observations y t between the upper and lower limits s lw t s up t are considered as the normal data where the value a in the equations regulates the range of the normal data the outliers at the t th time step based on the tf rule are evaluated by the first quartile q 1 t and the third quartile q 3 t of the d subestimations at the t th time step the upper limit of the normal data at the t th time step f up t is f up t q 3 t k i q r t the lower limit f lw t is f lw t q 1 t k i q r t where iqr is the interquartile range that is equal to q 3 t q 1 t in the same manner as in the σ rule the observations in the range of f lw t f up t are counted as the normal data it is well known that the tf rule is more appropriate for data with non gaussian distribution compared to the σ rule li wen 2011 zhang 2016 and the values of k 1 5 and a 2 689 for the tf rule and the σ rule respectively show similar normal data ranges in this study k 1 5 and a 3 were applied for the tf and σ rules respectively i e 0 7 and 0 27 outliers for each method 3 results and discussion 3 1 ler model training the ler model was trained using python v 3 7 https www python org with the keras library v 2 3 1 https keras io two intel xeon gold 6240 2 6 ghz 3 9 ghz turbo 18 cores hardware with 64 gb of memory and four nvidia quadro p400 with 2 gb for the gpu and ms windows 10 pro 4 core plus operating system for training the model 70 of the total data green shading box in fig 2 was used for each study area january 1 2005 august 31 2012 for pg well january 1 2004 august 31 2011 for nd well and january 1 2010 august 31 2017 for js well the rest of the data 30 of the total orange shading box in fig 2 were used as the testing data september 1 2012 december 31 2015 for pg well september 1 2011 december 31 2014 for nd well and september 1 2017 december 31 2020 for js well the applied lstm network was set up differently for each study area and the applied parameters are summarized in supplementary material for each model development the root mean squared error rmse between the actual and the estimated groundwater level was applied as the cost function to find the optimal hyperparameters systematical experiments have been conducted e g grid search and early stopping method was consistently applied to avoid overfitting fig 4 shows the groundwater level estimation results according to the precipitation blue bars using the training ler model for the testing period in the figure the black dots indicate the actual groundwater level data the red solid line is the mean level of the ensemble result and the yellow and gray shading represent 50 and 99 of the estimated ensemble result respectively as shown in the figure the estimated range of groundwater level covers the majority of the actual groundwater level fluctuations the decreasing pattern of the groundwater level according to the low precipitation amount is reasonably estimated based on the developed ler model in particular a relatively wide range of estimations is observed for the pg and js wells compared to that of the nd well which indicates that the ler model can reasonably evaluate the actual variation of daily groundwater level by considering the standard deviation of the groundwater level for each monitoring well high standard deviation values for the pg and js wells but low values for the nd well in table 1 meanwhile even though the range of the estimated ensemble is relatively wider than the results of other wells a relatively higher amount of the actual groundwater level of pg well is outside of the range of 50 of the ensemble compared to the other wells fig 4 a this is caused by the exogenous factors else precipitation that affect the groundwater level of pg well the developed estimation model solely based on the precipitation as the explanatory variable assessed that those variabilities could be outliers a quantitative performance evaluation was implemented by calculating the rmse and correlation coefficient cc between the actual and the estimated mean level of groundwater the results of which are represented in table 3 the validation results for the pg and js wells are relatively lower than those for the nd well which is a result of the highly variable daily fluctuations for the pg well and the outliers deviated from the main trend of the actual data for the js well all the results produced a low rmse less than 1 m and high cc value very strong correlation between the estimation of the ler model and actual data 3 2 validation of the outlier identification performance of the ler method in practice it is difficult to isolate the outliers from the actual field data despite the fact that the data contain the real outliers therefore in this study the outlier identification performance of the developed method was validated based on the hypothetically generated outliers for the testing data i e no outliers in the training dataset ten percent of the total groundwater level data were randomly selected and replaced by hypothetical outliers that were generated from a continuous uniform distribution with a range from v to v u v v where v max g l min g l in figs 5 7 the black dots are the actual groundwater level data whereas the red dots represent the generated hypothetical outliers some parts of the generated outliers are very close to the actual data as the outliers were generated by applying the continuous uniform distribution but the majority of the outliers tend to show significant differences from the actual values in this study the outlier identification methods of σ and tf rules were applied as the reference methods for performance validation of the developed model based on the generated hypothetical outliers figs 5 7 include the outlier identification results using the σ and tf rules and developed method in the figures a and b show the results of applying the σ and tf rules and the developed ler based outlier identification method respectively the blue and green solid lines indicate the boundaries of the normal data evaluated from the σ and tf rules respectively the red circles with the cross symbols indicate the hypothesized outliers evaluated as outliers in the results the red circles with the diamond symbol are misclassifications of the hypothesized outliers as normal data for all the monitoring well results applying both σ and tf rules showed similar outlier identification performances additionally the seasonal trends of the groundwater level data cannot be considered through the σ and tf rules figs 5 7 a which results in significant underestimation of the hypothesized outliers this fact can be confirmed by the quantity of data indicated by the red circles with the diamond symbol in the figure conversely as the developed ler model reasonably estimates the seasonal variations and the variability of daily fluctuations of the actual groundwater level data by considering the precipitation the majority of the hypothesized outliers were effectively discriminated from the actual groundwater level data therefore the number of misclassifications the red dots with the diamond symbol is remarkably smaller than the number from the σ and tf rules further comparative quantitative performance validation for the developed ler based outlier identification method is examined the results of which are in given in table 4 the table shows the number of correct classifications and misclassifications identification and the identification success percentage identification of the applied methods for the hypothesized outliers as summarized in the table the developed ler model is suitable for identifying the outliers by showing high outlier identification success percentages generally higher than 70 while the majority of success rates for the σ and tf rules are lower than 50 especially for the js monitoring well results as the seasonal variability of the groundwater level data is relatively high and the abnormal data from the 2020 year are included the normal data ranges evaluated from the σ and tf rules are considerably wide in turn the success percentages of those methods deteriorate to 18 00 and 10 61 respectively unlike the σ and tf rules the developed ler based outlier identification methods still show high identification success percentages 76 31 and 76 12 respectively the superiority of the developed method was additionally confirmed by analyzing its appropriateness for misclassified outliers the red circles with the diamond symbol in figs 5 7 fig 8 shows comparisons between histograms for the absolute value of differences between the actual groundwater level data black dots in figs 5 7 and hypothesized outliers successfully identified as outliers the red dots with cross symbols in figs 5 7 as well as for the absolute value of differences between the actual groundwater level data and hypothesized outliers identified as the normal data the red dots with diamond symbol in figs 5 7 which are represented with red and green bars in the figure respectively the differences between the values were calculated based on the tf rule results because the results of both the σ and tf rules are similar comparing the results for the tf rules and the developed method the histograms for the developed method the green bars in fig 8 a 2 b 2 and c 2 are distributed in a relatively small range compared to those for the tf rules the green bars in fig 9 a 1 b 1 and c 1 in addition statistical differences between the red and green bars in the case of the developed ler based outlier identification method fig 8 a 2 b 2 and c 2 are more evident compared to the tf rules results fig 8 a 1 b 1 and c 1 the results indicate that the misclassified outliers were similar to the actual data because the outliers were generated close to the actual data by using random values from the continuous uniform distribution i e the misclassified hypothesized outliers can be considered as normal data therefore the misclassified data as the normal but hypothesized outliers in the actual are likely to be evaluated as the normal data because those data are closed to the actual normal data which indicates that the performance of the developed method would be better than the results expected in table 4 3 3 results of identifying the outliers in the actual groundwater level time series data to verify the practical applicability of the developed ler based outlier identification method performance validation on the actual groundwater level monitoring data including the abnormal data that is not explained by the main trend of the groundwater level was carried out as shown in fig 2 c an abrupt decline in groundwater level data unrelated to the precipitation pattern was observed during the period from june 30 2020 to july 13 2020 at the js well the red box it could be caused via a temporary malfunction of the groundwater level monitoring device meanwhile it could be a result of excessive groundwater pumping but because the amount of the pumping for agricultural activities had not been recorded as there is no legal obligation for recording it is very difficult to conclude applying the σ and tf rules outlier identification method it is difficult to identify the data in the red box as an outlier in terms of the global view of the groundwater level data because it occurred within the actual data range however through the ler based outlier identification method that can estimate the seasonal trends and daily variability according to the precipitation the outliers were effectively discriminated from the normal data which is well represented in fig 9 in the figure the black dots indicate the actual groundwater level data the red solid line is the ensemble mean the yellow and gray shading represent 50 and 99 of the ensemble results estimated from the ler model respectively the blue bar is the precipitation the green solid line is the normal data boundary evaluated by applying the tf rule to the ensemble estimation and the red dots with the cross symbol indicate the identified outliers as shown in the figure the evaluated normal data range uncovers the outliers that is not explained by modelled influences i e precipitation in the red box even though the individual data of both precipitation and groundwater level data are not anomalous in the global sense considering the minimum and maximum value of the data this result indicates that the development of this study has a practical application in terms of identifying outliers in a contextual and collective sense by applying the variational trends of groundwater level ensemble estimations corresponding to precipitation patterns 4 discussion considering that the importance of surveillance using monitoring data is likely to increase for sustainable groundwater development with respect to groundwater quantity and quality the necessity of an effective method for securing sound data quality is indisputable the developed ler based outlier identification method is effective at discriminating the abnormal data with the consideration of the intrinsic statistical characteristics of the original data trend and exogenous factors that can affect the groundwater system comparing the applicability of the developed ler model to the process based groundwater level estimation model jeong and park 2017 jeong et al 2018 zaadnoordijk et al 2019 the ler model is based on a data driven model using a deep learning method which has the benefit of no requirement on a priori information for example the ler model has not assumed the physical model related to groundwater flow the distribution function of the interest factors and model parameters etc while a more realistic estimation can be made by applying the relationship between the actual data patterns in addition there is no limit on the types of exogenous factors that are applied to develop the ler model furthermore the automatic outlier identification based on the ler model estimation results would be useful to improve the efficiency of the inspection of the groundwater monitoring data which has been manually performed in general e g retike et al 2022 after processing the discriminated data as the outliers can be applied to various tasks for example 1 monitoring device malfunction detection 2 increasing groundwater flow model calibration performance by cleaning the noisy groundwater level data 3 assessment of decreasing or increasing groundwater level pattern irrelevant to the precipitation pattern 4 surveillance on groundwater pumping etc especially because the result can be automatically acquired based on real time monitoring data it is expected that more efficient maintenance of the monitoring devices will be feasible by embedding the development as the management software into the monitoring network system although the method proposed in this study was developed for using daily time series data the method can be easily expanded to apply the data with different frequencies e g hourly data but all the applied time series data must have the same time frequency to guarantee a sufficient estimation accuracy of the ler model at least one year of time series data including the whole seasonal variational trend of the meteorological and groundwater time series data would be recommended the exact length of the data required by the data driven model is highly dependent on the applied data and therefore several tests with respect to the data must be needed grid search can be recommended during the training the method proposed in this study is limited to the application when the training data are not highly variated by the data that is generated by other exogenous factors not having an interest but it can be overcome by applying the robust regression methods to the outliers e g lts or smoother techniques to develop the regression model jeong et al 2020 5 conclusions in this study a method to estimate the range of the normal groundwater level data was developed to identify outliers in terms of the global contextual and collective senses the normal data range was evaluated in consideration of the statistical characteristics of the data and the pattern of the precipitation time series data by the development of the lstm based ensemble regressor for groundwater level time series data i e the ler model that can estimate the multiple possible trends of the groundwater level the general rules of outlier identification methods i e σ and tf rules were applied to the ler ensemble estimation results to define the range of the normal data for additional practical outlier identification performance validation the actual groundwater level and precipitation data acquired from three groundwater monitoring stations and the corresponding nearest weather stations of south korea were applied to this study comparative performance validation with respect to the simple σ and tf rules were performed for all the monitoring data the developed ler based groundwater level estimation model is effective for estimating the seasonal trend and the variability of the groundwater level with consideration of precipitation patterns and the statistics on the groundwater level variations in addition the range of the normal data was properly evaluated by applying the σ and tf outlier identification rules to the ler ensemble estimation results in particular the superiority of the developed method for identifying the contextual or collective outliers can be confirmed because the proposed outlier identification method can effectively detect values that are abnormal in the context of the seasonal and precipitation patterns credit authorship

3233,loess has been widely used in site remediation engineering projects in the chinese loess plateau with the interaction between cacl2 solution and cutoff wall how does its permeability change is the response pattern consistent for different concentrations and what is the mechanism to address this series of problems the effects of cacl2 solutions of varying concentrations on the permeability of remolded loess were investigated by saturated permeability test and the mechanisms underlying these effects were explored through free swelling ratio zeta potential thermogravimetric analysis tga grain size tests as well as sem and mip tests the results indicate that ksat values of the samples permeated with both deionized water dw and 0 001 mol l cacl2 solution increase with time with a greater increase observed in the latter this is mainly due to that the electrical double layer edl effect induced by ca2 as the dominant factor controls particle flocculation and pore structure development under seepage of a 0 010 mol l cacl2 solution the edl effect plays a dominant role during the initial stage however chemical weathering causes the disintegration of loess particles and the dissolution of carbonates is inhibited by ca2 these are not conducive to pore development thus ksat first increases and then decreases significantly the ksat of samples permeated with a 0 005 mol l cacl2 solution first increases and then stabilizes which represents the transitional stage of the two aforementioned change trends this is mainly because the effective pores are increased by leaching and cation exchange and then the porosity is in dynamic equilibrium under the combined action of the edl effect geochemical action and microstructural evolution thus the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of remolded loess is sensitive to the concentrations of cacl2 solutions with different response modes keywords saturated hydraulic conductivity cacl2 solution electrical double layer effect microstructural evolution remolded loess data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction saturated hydraulic conductivity is a quantitative measure of water flowing through soil and is treated as one of the most important hydraulic properties of soil in several fields of study bagarello et al 2009 chapuis 2012 qiao et al 2018 for instance the recharge and discharge of groundwater are controlled by the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the surrounding geological media hou et al 2020 mügler et al 2019 in addition the geological disasters such as slope instability land subsidence and ground fissures which pose severe threats to life and property are associated with the flow of water in soil lu et al 2021 shimizu and ono 2016 wang et al 2017 moreover contaminants erode the soil through seepage and then destroy the soil structure resulting in the deterioration of engineering performance du et al 2015 xu et al 2021f thereby research on saturated hydraulic conductivity which can characterize the flow of water through soil is of considerable importance loess a quaternary geological sediment formed in arid and semi arid climates has a loose texture high porosity and well developed vertical joints feng et al 2021 hou et al 2021a li et al 2019a it is encountered all around the world including asia europe africa north america and south america duan et al 2021 nan et al 2021 zuo et al 2020 the chinese loess plateau clp exhibits the thickest largest oldest and most continuous loess distribution in the world covering about 640 000 km2 jia et al 2021 zhang et al 2020b because it is conveniently available and cheap loess is widely used in various projects such as the construction of landfill sites however the rapid economic development and urbanization in china have resulted in an increase in the generation of waste materials xu et al 2021b zhu et al 2016 soil contamination has attracted extensive attention owing to its effects on geotechnical structures public health and sustainable development hu et al 2021 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 chemical pollutants are major soil contaminants and can have serious even irreversible impacts on the surrounding water and soil environment gao et al 2019 this poses challenges for site restoration and reuse and even hinders the process of urbanization moreover soil pollution is known to cause soil structure damage engineering performance degradation and geological disasters liu et al 2021 xu et al 2021f contaminants enter soil primarily via seepage so permeability is particularly important to evaluate the anti seepage capability and structural stability of soil as well as the transport and diffusion of pollutants in soil bagarello et al 2009 meng and li 2019 xu et al 2021b therefore exploring the permeability behavior of remolded loess exposed to chemical solutions can provide a scientific basis for preventing soil pollution in geotechnical environments and geological disasters in the loess area numerous experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the influence of chemicals on the ksat of soil francisca and glatstein 2010 xu et al 2021b yılmaz et al 2008 zhu et al 2016 when soil is exposed to chemical fluids the interaction between these fluids and the soil induces responses of varying degrees and types which in turn cause changes in the electrical double layer and soil microstructure consequently the permeability of soil is affected for instance yılmaz et al 2008 investigated the difference in ksat between low plastic compacted clay and high plastic compacted clay under the seepage of inorganic chemical solutions and the mechanisms underlying these differences xu et al 2021b studied the effect of inorganic salt types on the ksat of remolded loess and comprehensively explained the reasons for the inconsistent permeability behavior based on the electrical double layer effect chemical action and microstructural evolution furthermore the swelling behavior of clay particles which is sensitive to chemical solutions has a significant impact on the hydraulic conductivity of soil jo et al 2001 zhu et al 2015 loess is rich in clay particles and clay minerals and thus its swelling behavior when in contact with chemical solutions should also be considered moreover the extraction of microstructural information helps establish the relationship between microstructural evolution and soil engineering properties jamei et al 2011 li et al 2021 xu et al 2021e the main factors affecting permeability include microstructural morphology and pore size distribution which are commonly characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem and mercury intrusion porosimetry mip respectively wang et al 2021a xu et al 2021b the response of grain size distribution to seepage is gradually gaining research attention zuo et al 2020 in general changes in the electrochemical environment in soil impact the soil microstructure resulting in changes in hydraulic conductivity zhu et al 2016 however research on this aspect of remolded loess is relatively scarce for example it is worth discussing how changes in the pore water chemical environment affect the electrical double layer effect how the microstructural morphology and pore size distribution change and how the saturated permeability of remolded loess responds these are urgent problems to be solved in the field of loess engineering construction and geological disaster prevention loess is rich in calcareous cements and carbonate minerals such as calcite and dolomite meanwhile the groundwater and landfill leachate in the chinese loess plateau are rich in calcium ions jia et al 2021 zhu et al 2016 in addition cacl2 has been commonly used in previous experimental studies to evaluate the influence of multivalent cations on the permeability shackelford et al 2000 shen et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 thus cacl2 was selected to enhance our understanding of the interaction between the ca2 concentration and the remolded loess and the associated response law of saturated hydraulic conductivity to this end a series of tests were designed including saturated permeability test free swelling test zeta potential thermogravimetric analysis tga grain size tests as well as sem and mip tests to achieve the following research objectives 1 to obtain the ksat change characteristics of remolded loess subjected to cacl2 solutions of varying concentrations 2 to evaluate the physicochemical interactions and the corresponding electrical double layer effect 3 to reveal microstructural evolution induced by cacl2 solutions qualitatively and quantitatively 4 to disclose the mechanism of ksat change in seepage process 2 materials and methods 2 1 test material the loess used in this study was collected from jingyang county shaanxi province in the southern region of the chinese loess plateau fig 1 the soil sample was q3 loess malan loess and had an earthy yellow appearance the physical properties of the loess sample were determined immediately after transporting it back to the laboratory table 1 the particle size distribution of the loess is shown in fig 2 a and it consisted of approximately 12 45 clay 81 34 silt and 6 11 sand according to the loess classification based upon the liquid limit and plasticity index hu et al 2021 this loess is classed as the low plasticity clay cl as shown in fig 2b 2 2 permeability test 2 2 1 preparation of remolded loess samples prior to compaction disturbed loess was air dried pulverized with a wooden hammer passed through a 2 mm sieve and dried in 101 2a electric blast drying oven at 105 c for 8 h then deionized water predetermined by weight was evenly sprayed on the thoroughly dried loess to achieve the optimal moisture content of approximately 17 subsequently the wet loess was passed through the 2 mm sieve again to break down large aggregates and ensure a uniform particle size ge et al 2021 xu et al 2021c then the wet loess was stored in black plastic bags to ensure that the moisture was distributed as homogeneously as possible lu et al 2021 and the difference in measured moisture content was controlled within 0 2 to avoid the impact of initial moisture content on soil structure and permeability xu et al 2021b subsequently the prepared wet loess was compacted to obtain remolded samples that were 61 8 mm in diameter and 40 0 mm in height 1 45 g cm3 for the hydraulic conductivity tests 2 2 2 preparation of solutions to thoroughly investigate the ksat of remolded loess subjected to ca2 solutions of varying concentrations cacl2 a reagent commonly used in previous experimental studies was selected for this study shackelford et al 2000 zhu et al 2016 previous studies have demonstrated that the preferred cacl2 concentrations used to study soil permeability were designed greater than 0 01 mol l jo et al 2001 kolstad et al 2004 zhu et al 2016 however less attention is focused on solutions with concentrations 0 01 mol l in addition the inorganic salt solution with a concentration range of 0 001 0 01 mol l is sufficient to reflect the effect of concentrations on the permeability of remolded loess xu et al 2020 thereby in this work cacl2 solutions with three concentrations 0 001 0 005 and 0 010 mol l were prepared by dissolving anhydrous calcium chloride in deionized water and stored in a shh c3000 constant temperature controller at 20 c dw was regarded as a solution with a cacl2 concentration of 0 mol l 2 2 3 determination of ksat in this work soil ksat was determined using the widely accepted constant head method chen et al 2021 jafari et al 2017 soracco et al 2010 the experimental setup is shown in fig 3 to conduct the permeability tests the loess samples were first saturated from the bottom to the top using cacl2 solutions of varying concentrations for details about the experimental procedure the reader is referred to xu et al 2021b the saturation method not only uses the water pressure and capillary tension to remove the residual gas in the soil as much as possible but also avoids the damage caused to the soil structure by excessive water pressure xu et al 2021d in this case saturated loess specimens can achieve saturation levels greater than 95 subsequently ksat was measured with a hydraulic gradient of 3 which was maintained using a seepage system device the water overflow was collected using a graduated collecting bottle the volume of water overflow was measured for approximately 12 h and 14 sets of data were recorded in a consecutive sequence this procedure was carried out at 20 to eliminate the influence of temperature on ksat the formula used for calculating ksat is as follows 1 k sat q a i t q l a δ h t where q is the overflow in period t cm3 a is the cross sectional area of the loess sample cm2 t is time s i is the hydraulic gradient l is the sample height cm and δh is the head difference cm 2 3 free swelling test the free swelling ratio is the ratio of the volume of the artificially prepared dried and ground soil sample expanded in the solution to the original volume of soil free swelling tests were basically conducted following the methods in sgtm 2019 air dried natural loess was ground using a mortar and pestle until 100 passed through a 0 5 mm sieve dried thoroughly in a 101 2a electric blast drying oven at 105 c and then cooled to a temperature of 20 c in a dryer following this approximately 30 ml of deionized water or cacl2 solution was poured into a clean 50 ml volumetric cylinder and 10 ml of pretreated loess was added to the volumetric cylinder the solution was stirred up and down 10 times each using an agitator and the agitator and volumetric cylinder wall were washed with the corresponding solution until the suspension reached the 50 ml mark after the suspension was clarified the volume of loess was recorded every 3 h until the difference between the two consecutive measurements did not exceed 0 1 ml indicating that the swelling had stabilized the formula used for calculating the free swelling ratio is as follows 2 δ ef v s v 0 v 0 100 where δef is the free swelling ratio vs is the volume of loess after swelling stabilization in the solution ml and v 0 is the initial volume of loess ml 2 4 determination of zeta potential zeta potential ζ p determined from measurements of electrophoretic mobility is a fundamental property that influences soil permeability aydin et al 2004 prior to testing 100 mg of pretreated loess was transferred to 100 ml glass beakers containing 100 ml cacl2 solution of various concentrations 0 0 001 0 005 and 0 010 mol l this mixture of water and soil was stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 30 min during the determination of zeta potential the dts1070 micro electrophoresis cell was washed with dw before and after each measurement to prevent cross contamination before each measurement the dts1070 micro electrophoresis cell was moistened with the tested water and soil suspension thrice to ensure accuracy the zeta potentials of each sample were measured using a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano zse malvern germany 2 5 thermogravimetric analysis thermogravimetric analysis tga can be used to determine the water type free water fw loosely bound water lbw and tightly bound water tbw and their corresponding quantum of water on the surfaces of soil particles hou et al 2021b zhang et al 2018 because the loess used in this study is a clay type loess studying the transformation of water on loess particle surfaces under cacl2 solutions of varying concentrations based on tga helps explain the change behavior of saturated hydraulic conductivity previous studies have shown that when the moisture content is between the liquid limit and plastic limit most of the water in the clay soil is weakly bound water and a small amount is fw prost et al 1998 singh and wallender 2008 in this work 30 g of pretreated natural loess was sprayed with cacl2 solutions of varying concentrations to prepare samples with an initial moisture content of 25 after the sample box was sealed and allowed to stand for 24 h tga was conducted using an htc 3 comprehensive thermogravimetric analyzer the temperature was raised from 30 c to 250 c during the process of tga 2 6 grain size analysis the grain size distribution of loess after seepage was obtained to explore its response to cacl2 solutions of varying concentrations to this end 20 g of air dried loose soil from the center of the remolded loess sample after seepage was obtained and ground until 100 passed through a 2 mm sieve fully mixed samples weighing 5 g were pretreated as described by hou et al 2021a ultrasonic oscillation was conducted for 15 min after adding sodium hexametaphosphate which helps disperse soil particles following this the grain size distribution of loess was obtained 2 7 microstructure tests a variety of laboratory and imaging techniques have been developed to characterize soil microstructure rabot et al 2018 mip is a typical indirect method that is based on a simple principle and can be used to test a large range of pore sizes 3 nm to 500 μm and is very useful to describe a pore network and its size distribution romero 2013 wang et al 2020 in the mip measurement the column of 2 cm3 was cut carefully from central parts of loess samples which need to be first dried the changes in pore size distribution of loess samples were analyzed using a mercury intrusion porosimeter autopore iv 9500 and its principle was as follows washburn 1921 3 p 4 σ h g cos θ d where p is the mercury pressure σ hg is the surface tension of mercury 0 484 n m and θ is the contact angle between mercury and the pore wall 130 griffiths and joshi 1989 monroy et al 2010 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 as opposed to imaging techniques mip cannot characterize the morphology of soil microstructure however sem can be used to interpret soil microstructural morphology as it offers the advantage of geometric visualization rabot et al 2018 in this work soil columns with a diameter of 1 cm and a height of 2 cm were taken from loess samples which also need to be first dried the following operation process has been described in detail by xu et al 2021a the micrographs of soil microstructure were observed by a fei quanta 200 scanning electron microscope therefore mip and sem were used to evaluate the response of microscale structural characteristics of remolded loess to cacl2 solutions with varying concentrations 3 results 3 1 characteristics of ksat change the ksat of the remolded loess samples as a function of the concentrations of cacl2 solutions is shown in fig 4 the ksat increased as the concentration increased in the range of 0 0 005 mol l whereas it markedly decreased at the concentration of 0 01 mol l fig 4a the corresponding mean values during the whole seepage period were 1 50e 5 1 87e 5 2 27e 5 and 1 79e 5 cm s in general the addition of cacl2 to the infiltration solution enhances the ksat of remolded loess the ksat of the samples permeated with dw and 0 001 mol l cacl2 solution increased with time during seepage with the enhancement in the latter being more prominent the ksat of the sample under seepage with 0 005 mol l cacl2 solution increased for the first four days and stabilized afterwards as for 0 01 mol l cacl2 solution the ksat increased first and then decreased thus the ksat of remolded loess is sensitive to the concentrations of the cacl2 solutions 3 2 free swelling ratio the concentration of the cacl2 solution had a significant impact on the free swelling of loess as shown in table 2 the free swelling ratio of loess decreased as the ca2 concentration increased in the range of 0 0 01 mol l and the corresponding δef values are 14 76 14 29 11 22 and 9 59 for dw 0 001 mol l 0 005 mol l and 0 01 mol l cacl2 solutions due to the gradient in free energy caused by the elevated cation concentration water moved out of the interlayer area which was manifested at the macro scale as a reduction in the swelling of soil jo et al 2001 3 3 zeta potential the ζ p of loess particles versus the cacl2 concentration is presented in table 3 the ζ p changes from 10 53 mv for the 0 001 mol l cacl2 treated suspension to 7 20 mv for the 0 01 mol l cacl2 treated suspension however the ζ p of loess particles was more negative in dw 14 47 mv the ζ p of clay particles is a sign of its diffuse double layer thickness darrow et al 2020 thus the decrease in the absolute values of ζ p with increasing ca2 content could be attributed to the decrease in the thickness of the diffuse double layer caused by ca2 3 4 tga tga was performed on loess samples under cacl2 solutions of different concentrations and the variations in sample mass with increasing temperature namely the tg curves are presented in fig 5 the tg curves can be divided into three temperature intervals namely 60 c 60 110 c and 110 230 c which represent the thermogravimetric range of fw lbw and tbw respectively hou et al 2021b the contents of fw lbw and tbw are in the ranges of 3 53 4 71 20 40 18 54 and 1 71 2 39 respectively indicating that lbw is likely to be the dominant water type on the surfaces of loess particles as the cacl2 concentration increases the contents of fw and tbw increase whereas the lbw content decreases significantly this indicates that cacl2 mainly controls the engineering properties of loess by affecting the transformation of lbw 3 5 grain size analysis fig 6 shows the particle size distribution of loess after seepage of cacl2 solutions of varying concentrations all samples are dominated by silt with proportions in the range of 81 32 81 96 the proportions of clay and sand are in the range of 12 55 13 23 and 4 83 6 09 respectively compared with the grain size distribution of the loess before seepage table 1 and fig 1 the contents of clay and silt increased after seepage while the content of sand decreased this trend became more significant as the cacl2 concentration increased therefore it can be inferred that the cacl2 solution causes strong chemical weathering and finely crushes loess particles 4 discussion 4 1 electrical double layer effect for soils with clay content exceeding 10 changes in pore water chemistry can have a considerable impact on soil properties gajo and maines 2007 xu et al 2021f zhang et al 2013 as shown in table 1 the loess used in this study contains 12 47 clay particles consequently the physicochemical effects induced by clay particles need to be considered in the schematic diagram of a remolded soil specimen structure fig 7 a the surface of the clay particles contains a layer of bound water which can reduce the volume of effective pores and hinder the flow of water ren et al 2016 xu et al 2021b the water outside the lbw layer is fw fig 7b li et al 2015 the edl has an important impact on the aforementioned properties of soils such as permeability darrow et al 2020 and expansibility ren et al 2019 zeta potential which characterizes the thickness of the edl is a critical parameter for explaining the process of change in the hydraulic properties of soil zeng et al 2020 therefore the distribution pattern of water on particles and particle dispersion characteristics are strongly controlled by edl thickness as shown in tables 2 and 3 the higher the c cacl 2 the less charged the loess particles and the lower the free swelling ratio of loess indicating that adsorption of ca2 compresses the edl and thereby inhibits the swelling of clay a strong negative correlation between the δef and ζ p was observed with the correlation coefficient r being 0 90 fig 8 thus the zeta potential strongly influences the expansion property furthermore δef and ζ p are strongly correlated with c cacl2 with r values of 0 98 and 0 87 respectively this further confirms the aforementioned phenomenon in addition the development of a thicker edl promotes the transformation from lbw to fw hou et al 2021b a strong positive correlation was observed between ζ p and fw r 0 81 whereas a strong negative correlation was seen between ζ p and lbw 1 00 fig 8 these results are in agreement with those obtained by hou et al 2021b in the present study an increase in the cacl2 concentration promotes the adsorption of ca2 and compresses the edl this reduces the swelling of clay which is conducive to the aggregation and compression of soil particles meanwhile the transformation from the lbw layer to the fw layer expands the space within which free gravity water can flow which should enhance soil permeability however the test results obtained with the remolded loess in this study are not completely consistent with this inference as shown in fig 8 the initial saturated hydraulic conductivity ki exhibits a strong positive relationship with c cacl2 r 0 77 ζ p r 0 95 and fw r 0 95 whereas it exhibits a strong negative relationship with δef r 0 96 and lbw r 0 94 the mean saturated hydraulic conductivity km exhibits similar statistical variation trends the final saturated hydraulic conductivity kf exhibits a weak inter relationship with δef r 0 014 ζ p r 0 27 and lbw r 0 26 compared with ki and km kf exhibits a different correlation with c cacl2 namely a negative correlation r 0 18 this is mainly caused by the difference in the ksat variation trend with time during the seepage period fig 4 for instance the ksat of remolded loess decreases significantly in the later stage under seepage of a 0 01 mol l cacl2 solution therefore in this study the cacl2 concentration alters the swelling of loess and the evolution of the water types on particle surfaces through the edl effect thereby significantly impacting the ksat in other words the initial saturated hydraulic conductivity increases as the cacl2 concentration increases clay particles having smaller ζ p values cause the compression of the edl resulting in an increase in space for fw and consequently enhancing permeability darrow et al 2020 xu et al 2021f water with a certain degree of binding capacity between pores and clay particles is relatively immobile this fraction of water is called bound water and occupies a certain amount of the available pore space zhu et al 2016 based on the electrical double layer theory the effective porosity of soil proposed by zhu et al 2016 is used to quantitatively characterize the change in effective pore space under different chemical solutions the formula is as follows 4 n e n 1 p bw 100 5 n g s ρ d g s 100 where n is the soil porosity ρd is the dry density of the soil sample g cm3 gs is the specific gravity of loess particles gs 2 71 ne is the effective porosity and pbw is the fraction of bound water as a uniform dry density was maintained in all remolded loess samples the initial porosity of the soil samples was the same and n was equal to 46 49 in this study however compared with deionized water the ki increases by 0 09 times 0 21 times and 0 17 times under the seepage of cacl2 solutions with concentrations of 0 001 0 005 and 0 01 mol l respectively the effective porosity of the soil sample shown in fig 9 increases as the cacl2 concentration increases which indicates that the ki essentially increases with the cacl2 concentration loess is rich in clay minerals xu et al 2021c during the process of sample saturation the ca2 in the solution and monovalent metal ions e g na on the surfaces of the clay minerals undergo significant exchange and adsorption compressing the electrical double layer and thus reducing the content of bound water 4 2 microstructural evolution the change in the permeability of remolded loess with time can be elucidated based on the evolution of the microstructure during the process of seepage microstructure is widely used to evaluate the physical and mechanical properties of soil and to reveal the relationship between the microstructure of soil and its macro scale behavior hou et al 2021b li et al 2019b xiao et al 2022 to date research has shown that the initial microstructure cannot sufficiently explain the subsequent changes in soil properties wang et al 2019 xu et al 2021e the micro scale change mechanism of permeability can be elucidated by comparing the microstructure before and after seepage xu et al 2020 zuo et al 2020 4 2 1 microstructural morphology the microstructure of loess can essentially be described based on particle patterns contact relations cementations and pore forms these parameters are interdependent and are widely used in the study of the engineering properties of loess hou et al 2021c li et al 2019b xie et al 2018 xu et al 2021a skeletal particles are the pillars of the loess structural system and their contact relations mainly include point contact and face cementation carbonates and clay particles play the role of cementation in loess which is vital to the stability of skeleton structure xie et al 2018 the interaction of the three generates inter aggregate pores and intra aggregate pores the inter aggregate pores can be further classified as spaced pores and intergranular pores shao et al 2018 observation of the microstructure of loess can help understand the mechanisms by which different cacl2 solutions affect permeability sem microphotographs presented in fig 10 show the soil structure of the remolded loess specimens before and after seepage prior to seepage a large number of clay and fine particles are attached to the surfaces of coarse particles forming a uniform and dispersed structure fig 10a the remolding process of loess destroys the connections between the soil particles and the soil microstructure becomes dissipative wang et al 2021a as for the samples after seepage fine particles agglomerate into larger particles leading to the formation of larger pore spaces fig 10b c and d this is mainly due to the decrease in electrostatic repulsion and the increase in van der waals s attractive forces between clay particles caused by the adsorption of ca2 this is further confirmed by the wide distribution of larger aggregates also confirms this reason cations can control the flocculation of particles and the development of pore spaces by altering the edl thickness darrow et al 2020 xu et al 2021b zhang et al 2014 as reported by zuo et al 2020 larger aggregate sizes and fewer fine particles yield larger voids in the soil and consequently enhance permeability as shown in fig 4 the ksat of the samples permeated with dw and 0 001 mol l cacl2 solution increased with time the ksat of the sample permeated with 0 005 mol l cacl2 solution first increased and then stabilized moreover the kf values of the samples were significantly higher than the ki values and kf increased with the c cacl2 compared with other loess specimens the sample infiltrated with 0 01 mol l cacl2 solution had more cement between coarse particles and the distribution of intra aggregate pores was wider the degree of pore development was relatively weak fig 10e this may be because the high concentration of ca2 inhibited the dissolution of the carbonate cement and even caused carbonate precipitation the contents of clay and silt increased after seepage while the sand content decreased this change trend became more prominent as the cacl2 concentration increased fig 6 c cacl2 had a strong positive relationship with clay r 0 78 and silt contents r 0 98 whereas it had a strong negative relationship with sand content r 0 96 as shown in fig 8 thus solutions with high concentrations of cacl2 possess strong chemical differentiation and exhibit a high possibility of damage to coarse particles resulting in larger quantities of fine and clay particles for example the soil sample after seepage of a 0 01 mol l cacl2 solution shows many fine particles in a dispersed contact state fig 10e which corroborates the change in particle distribution shown in fig 8 therefore the corresponding permeability decreases significantly during the later stage of seepage 4 2 2 pore size distribution fig 11 presents the pore size distribution of samples before and after seepage using semi logarithmic scales the cumulative pore volumes of specimens after seepage of the different cacl2 solutions are higher than that of the original sample this is especially true for the sample subjected to seepage of the 0 005 mol l cacl2 solution fig 11a this can be explained based on the leaching action which increases the pore space during the seepage process xu et al 2021c the pore size density curves exhibit two peaks fig 11b an identical dominant diameter ranging from 0 01 to 0 07 μm occurs in the region of the micro pore series indicating that seepage has a negligible effect on the family of intra aggregate pores for the macro pore series the particle size distribution of remolded loess before seepage exhibits a major peak around 9 05 μm whereas the dominant macro pore sizes are 13 94 μm 11 33 μm 24 10 μm and 11 33 μm for dw and cacl2 solutions with concentrations of 0 001 0 005 and 0 01 mol l respectively the peak position was observed to shift to the left under varying degrees after seepage indicating that the pores in the loess samples could develop during the process of seepage the observations indicate that the ksat of soil samples is dominantly influenced by macro pore i e inter aggregate pores sizes 4 3 mechanism underlying changes in saturated permeability for the remolded loess samples subjected to dw and the 0 001 mol l cacl2 solution the saturated permeability increased continuously with time with the increase in the latter being more prominent ca2 can substitute the monovalent cations on the surface of clay mineral particles leading to a decreases in the thickness of electrical double layer and bound water and hence the increase of effective porosity zhu et al 2016 besides the addition of low concentration inorganic salts in the water flow can also promote the dissolution of soil components thus enhancing the leaching effect and developing pores xu et al 2021b so the electrical double layer effect and chemical leaching were the dominant factors and induced the distribution of effective pores which enhanced permeability with a greater degree for 0 001 mol l cacl2 solution the microstructure shown in fig 10 verifies the above phenomenon the ksat of the sample permeated with 0 01 mol l cacl2 solution first increased and then decreased with the decrease being more prominent as mentioned earlier a thinner edl promotes the enhancement of permeability the core function of cation exchange and adsorption is to change the structure of the electric double layer darrow et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 and this action gradually weakens as the seepage process progresses xu et al 2021c moreover the fragmentation of coarse particles sand particles not only reduces the stability of the skeleton structure but may also induce the collapse of the soil structure the generated fine particles adhere to the particles surrounding the pores reducing the connectivity of the pores in addition a large amount of ca2 can inhibit the dissolution of carbonate minerals and even induce precipitation as shown in fig 10e the distribution of intra aggregate pores of soil sample after seepage was wider and the degree of pore development was relatively weak meanwhile the pore volume and the peak value of the pore size density are low after seepage fig 11b which serves as evidence of the aforementioned water and soil action mechanism therefore the permeability increases at early stage of seepage and decreases significantly during the later stage of seepage it is worth mentioning that the ksat of the sample subjected to seepage of the 0 005 mol l cacl2 solution first increased and later stabilized this trend of change in permeability could represent the transition type of the above two phenomena during the initial stage the reason for the increase of permeability is similar to that mentioned earlier namely the electrical double layer effect and chemical leaching were the dominant factors to enhance soil permeability during the stage of stabilization the effective pores of the soil sample are in a state of dynamic equilibrium under the combined influence of the electrical double layer effect geochemical action and microstructural evolution 4 4 comparison with other soils the underlying mechanism responsible for changes in the saturated permeability of remolded loess subjected to cacl2 solution of varying concentrations was summarized in this study the electrical double layer effect and chemical interactions are the dominant factors that cause the evolution of microstructure and change the anti seepage performance of soil lower swell and higher initial hydraulic conductivity of loess were basically associated with an increase in concentration of cacl2 solution which is generally consistent with the research conclusions of other types of soil for instance geosynthetic clay liners gcls were used as hydraulic barriers in liner and cover systems for waste containment facilities with the increase of cacl2 concentration from 0 005 mol l to 1 mol l its hydraulic conductivity increased about 104 times jo et al 2001 in addition compared with the tap water the permeability of clay based cutoff walls permeated with 0 2 mol l cacl2 solution was higher zhu et al 2016 and zhu et al 2016 found the replacement reaction between calcium ions in the permeate and monovalent metal cations adsorbed on the surface of clay mineral particles results in the thinning of the diffusion double layer the increase of effective porosity and the enhancement of permeability furthermore the hydraulic conductivity of bentonite filter cakes also increased with an increase in cacl2 concentrations 5 10 15 20 40 60 mmol l during the test period of 30 min which may be because the connected pores between bentonite aggregates increase and become unblocked shen et al 2016 therefore the findings in this study have broad application value to other soils although little attention has been paid to the change law and mechanism of long term permeability of soil this study can provide a new perspective for the research on the alteration of anti seepage performance of other contaminated soils 5 conclusions saturated hydraulic conductivity in remolded loess under the effects of cacl2 solutions of varying concentrations was investigated experimentally in this study for this purpose remolded loess samples were obtained using a wet compaction method a series of cacl2 solutions were prepared and saturated permeability tests were carried out the electrical double layer edl effect was evaluated using the zeta potential thermogravimetric analysis and the free swelling ratio microstructural evolution was qualitatively and quantitatively investigated using scanning electron microscopy mercury intrusion porosimetry and grain size analysis the following conclusions can be drawn the saturated permeability of remolded loess is sensitive to the concentration of cacl2 solutions the initial ksat increased with as the cacl2 concentration increased primarily due to the edl effect and chemical dissolution however there were significant differences in the variation trend of permeability with time the ksat of the samples under seepage of dw and the 0 001 mol l cacl2 solution increased with time during the seepage process the electrical double layer effect induced by ca2 controlled the flocculation between particles and the development of the pore structure it also promoted the transformation of lbw to free gravity water enhancing the distribution of effective pores the addition of low concentration cacl2 solution can also promote the dissolution of soil components thus enhancing the leaching effect and developing pores thus under seepage of the 0 001 mol l cacl2 solution the increase in saturated permeability was greater than that under seepage of dw under seepage of the high concentration cacl2 solution coarse particles sand easily disintegrated into fine particles clay and silt which could reduce the stability of the skeleton structure and the connectivity of pores meanwhile the high concentration of ca2 inhibited the dissolution of carbonates which was not conducive to the development of pores moreover as the cation alternating adsorption gradually weakens during the seepage process the edl effect did not have a major effect on the change in permeability therefore the ksat of the sample permeated with the 0 01 mol l cacl2 solution first increased and then significantly decreased the ksat of the sample permeated with the 0 005 mol l cacl2 solution first increased and then stabilized which could represent the transition type of the above two phenomena the reason for the increase of permeability is similar to that mentioned earlier namely the edl effect and chemical leaching during the stage of stabilization the effective pores in the soil sample were in a state of dynamic equilibrium under the combined influence of the edl effect geochemical action and microstructural evolution these findings in this study which have broad application value to other soils are expected to provide a scientific basis for preventing the diffusion of pollutants in geotechnical environments and improving the safety of engineering structures credit authorship contribution statement panpan

3233,loess has been widely used in site remediation engineering projects in the chinese loess plateau with the interaction between cacl2 solution and cutoff wall how does its permeability change is the response pattern consistent for different concentrations and what is the mechanism to address this series of problems the effects of cacl2 solutions of varying concentrations on the permeability of remolded loess were investigated by saturated permeability test and the mechanisms underlying these effects were explored through free swelling ratio zeta potential thermogravimetric analysis tga grain size tests as well as sem and mip tests the results indicate that ksat values of the samples permeated with both deionized water dw and 0 001 mol l cacl2 solution increase with time with a greater increase observed in the latter this is mainly due to that the electrical double layer edl effect induced by ca2 as the dominant factor controls particle flocculation and pore structure development under seepage of a 0 010 mol l cacl2 solution the edl effect plays a dominant role during the initial stage however chemical weathering causes the disintegration of loess particles and the dissolution of carbonates is inhibited by ca2 these are not conducive to pore development thus ksat first increases and then decreases significantly the ksat of samples permeated with a 0 005 mol l cacl2 solution first increases and then stabilizes which represents the transitional stage of the two aforementioned change trends this is mainly because the effective pores are increased by leaching and cation exchange and then the porosity is in dynamic equilibrium under the combined action of the edl effect geochemical action and microstructural evolution thus the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of remolded loess is sensitive to the concentrations of cacl2 solutions with different response modes keywords saturated hydraulic conductivity cacl2 solution electrical double layer effect microstructural evolution remolded loess data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction saturated hydraulic conductivity is a quantitative measure of water flowing through soil and is treated as one of the most important hydraulic properties of soil in several fields of study bagarello et al 2009 chapuis 2012 qiao et al 2018 for instance the recharge and discharge of groundwater are controlled by the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the surrounding geological media hou et al 2020 mügler et al 2019 in addition the geological disasters such as slope instability land subsidence and ground fissures which pose severe threats to life and property are associated with the flow of water in soil lu et al 2021 shimizu and ono 2016 wang et al 2017 moreover contaminants erode the soil through seepage and then destroy the soil structure resulting in the deterioration of engineering performance du et al 2015 xu et al 2021f thereby research on saturated hydraulic conductivity which can characterize the flow of water through soil is of considerable importance loess a quaternary geological sediment formed in arid and semi arid climates has a loose texture high porosity and well developed vertical joints feng et al 2021 hou et al 2021a li et al 2019a it is encountered all around the world including asia europe africa north america and south america duan et al 2021 nan et al 2021 zuo et al 2020 the chinese loess plateau clp exhibits the thickest largest oldest and most continuous loess distribution in the world covering about 640 000 km2 jia et al 2021 zhang et al 2020b because it is conveniently available and cheap loess is widely used in various projects such as the construction of landfill sites however the rapid economic development and urbanization in china have resulted in an increase in the generation of waste materials xu et al 2021b zhu et al 2016 soil contamination has attracted extensive attention owing to its effects on geotechnical structures public health and sustainable development hu et al 2021 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 chemical pollutants are major soil contaminants and can have serious even irreversible impacts on the surrounding water and soil environment gao et al 2019 this poses challenges for site restoration and reuse and even hinders the process of urbanization moreover soil pollution is known to cause soil structure damage engineering performance degradation and geological disasters liu et al 2021 xu et al 2021f contaminants enter soil primarily via seepage so permeability is particularly important to evaluate the anti seepage capability and structural stability of soil as well as the transport and diffusion of pollutants in soil bagarello et al 2009 meng and li 2019 xu et al 2021b therefore exploring the permeability behavior of remolded loess exposed to chemical solutions can provide a scientific basis for preventing soil pollution in geotechnical environments and geological disasters in the loess area numerous experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the influence of chemicals on the ksat of soil francisca and glatstein 2010 xu et al 2021b yılmaz et al 2008 zhu et al 2016 when soil is exposed to chemical fluids the interaction between these fluids and the soil induces responses of varying degrees and types which in turn cause changes in the electrical double layer and soil microstructure consequently the permeability of soil is affected for instance yılmaz et al 2008 investigated the difference in ksat between low plastic compacted clay and high plastic compacted clay under the seepage of inorganic chemical solutions and the mechanisms underlying these differences xu et al 2021b studied the effect of inorganic salt types on the ksat of remolded loess and comprehensively explained the reasons for the inconsistent permeability behavior based on the electrical double layer effect chemical action and microstructural evolution furthermore the swelling behavior of clay particles which is sensitive to chemical solutions has a significant impact on the hydraulic conductivity of soil jo et al 2001 zhu et al 2015 loess is rich in clay particles and clay minerals and thus its swelling behavior when in contact with chemical solutions should also be considered moreover the extraction of microstructural information helps establish the relationship between microstructural evolution and soil engineering properties jamei et al 2011 li et al 2021 xu et al 2021e the main factors affecting permeability include microstructural morphology and pore size distribution which are commonly characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem and mercury intrusion porosimetry mip respectively wang et al 2021a xu et al 2021b the response of grain size distribution to seepage is gradually gaining research attention zuo et al 2020 in general changes in the electrochemical environment in soil impact the soil microstructure resulting in changes in hydraulic conductivity zhu et al 2016 however research on this aspect of remolded loess is relatively scarce for example it is worth discussing how changes in the pore water chemical environment affect the electrical double layer effect how the microstructural morphology and pore size distribution change and how the saturated permeability of remolded loess responds these are urgent problems to be solved in the field of loess engineering construction and geological disaster prevention loess is rich in calcareous cements and carbonate minerals such as calcite and dolomite meanwhile the groundwater and landfill leachate in the chinese loess plateau are rich in calcium ions jia et al 2021 zhu et al 2016 in addition cacl2 has been commonly used in previous experimental studies to evaluate the influence of multivalent cations on the permeability shackelford et al 2000 shen et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 thus cacl2 was selected to enhance our understanding of the interaction between the ca2 concentration and the remolded loess and the associated response law of saturated hydraulic conductivity to this end a series of tests were designed including saturated permeability test free swelling test zeta potential thermogravimetric analysis tga grain size tests as well as sem and mip tests to achieve the following research objectives 1 to obtain the ksat change characteristics of remolded loess subjected to cacl2 solutions of varying concentrations 2 to evaluate the physicochemical interactions and the corresponding electrical double layer effect 3 to reveal microstructural evolution induced by cacl2 solutions qualitatively and quantitatively 4 to disclose the mechanism of ksat change in seepage process 2 materials and methods 2 1 test material the loess used in this study was collected from jingyang county shaanxi province in the southern region of the chinese loess plateau fig 1 the soil sample was q3 loess malan loess and had an earthy yellow appearance the physical properties of the loess sample were determined immediately after transporting it back to the laboratory table 1 the particle size distribution of the loess is shown in fig 2 a and it consisted of approximately 12 45 clay 81 34 silt and 6 11 sand according to the loess classification based upon the liquid limit and plasticity index hu et al 2021 this loess is classed as the low plasticity clay cl as shown in fig 2b 2 2 permeability test 2 2 1 preparation of remolded loess samples prior to compaction disturbed loess was air dried pulverized with a wooden hammer passed through a 2 mm sieve and dried in 101 2a electric blast drying oven at 105 c for 8 h then deionized water predetermined by weight was evenly sprayed on the thoroughly dried loess to achieve the optimal moisture content of approximately 17 subsequently the wet loess was passed through the 2 mm sieve again to break down large aggregates and ensure a uniform particle size ge et al 2021 xu et al 2021c then the wet loess was stored in black plastic bags to ensure that the moisture was distributed as homogeneously as possible lu et al 2021 and the difference in measured moisture content was controlled within 0 2 to avoid the impact of initial moisture content on soil structure and permeability xu et al 2021b subsequently the prepared wet loess was compacted to obtain remolded samples that were 61 8 mm in diameter and 40 0 mm in height 1 45 g cm3 for the hydraulic conductivity tests 2 2 2 preparation of solutions to thoroughly investigate the ksat of remolded loess subjected to ca2 solutions of varying concentrations cacl2 a reagent commonly used in previous experimental studies was selected for this study shackelford et al 2000 zhu et al 2016 previous studies have demonstrated that the preferred cacl2 concentrations used to study soil permeability were designed greater than 0 01 mol l jo et al 2001 kolstad et al 2004 zhu et al 2016 however less attention is focused on solutions with concentrations 0 01 mol l in addition the inorganic salt solution with a concentration range of 0 001 0 01 mol l is sufficient to reflect the effect of concentrations on the permeability of remolded loess xu et al 2020 thereby in this work cacl2 solutions with three concentrations 0 001 0 005 and 0 010 mol l were prepared by dissolving anhydrous calcium chloride in deionized water and stored in a shh c3000 constant temperature controller at 20 c dw was regarded as a solution with a cacl2 concentration of 0 mol l 2 2 3 determination of ksat in this work soil ksat was determined using the widely accepted constant head method chen et al 2021 jafari et al 2017 soracco et al 2010 the experimental setup is shown in fig 3 to conduct the permeability tests the loess samples were first saturated from the bottom to the top using cacl2 solutions of varying concentrations for details about the experimental procedure the reader is referred to xu et al 2021b the saturation method not only uses the water pressure and capillary tension to remove the residual gas in the soil as much as possible but also avoids the damage caused to the soil structure by excessive water pressure xu et al 2021d in this case saturated loess specimens can achieve saturation levels greater than 95 subsequently ksat was measured with a hydraulic gradient of 3 which was maintained using a seepage system device the water overflow was collected using a graduated collecting bottle the volume of water overflow was measured for approximately 12 h and 14 sets of data were recorded in a consecutive sequence this procedure was carried out at 20 to eliminate the influence of temperature on ksat the formula used for calculating ksat is as follows 1 k sat q a i t q l a δ h t where q is the overflow in period t cm3 a is the cross sectional area of the loess sample cm2 t is time s i is the hydraulic gradient l is the sample height cm and δh is the head difference cm 2 3 free swelling test the free swelling ratio is the ratio of the volume of the artificially prepared dried and ground soil sample expanded in the solution to the original volume of soil free swelling tests were basically conducted following the methods in sgtm 2019 air dried natural loess was ground using a mortar and pestle until 100 passed through a 0 5 mm sieve dried thoroughly in a 101 2a electric blast drying oven at 105 c and then cooled to a temperature of 20 c in a dryer following this approximately 30 ml of deionized water or cacl2 solution was poured into a clean 50 ml volumetric cylinder and 10 ml of pretreated loess was added to the volumetric cylinder the solution was stirred up and down 10 times each using an agitator and the agitator and volumetric cylinder wall were washed with the corresponding solution until the suspension reached the 50 ml mark after the suspension was clarified the volume of loess was recorded every 3 h until the difference between the two consecutive measurements did not exceed 0 1 ml indicating that the swelling had stabilized the formula used for calculating the free swelling ratio is as follows 2 δ ef v s v 0 v 0 100 where δef is the free swelling ratio vs is the volume of loess after swelling stabilization in the solution ml and v 0 is the initial volume of loess ml 2 4 determination of zeta potential zeta potential ζ p determined from measurements of electrophoretic mobility is a fundamental property that influences soil permeability aydin et al 2004 prior to testing 100 mg of pretreated loess was transferred to 100 ml glass beakers containing 100 ml cacl2 solution of various concentrations 0 0 001 0 005 and 0 010 mol l this mixture of water and soil was stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 30 min during the determination of zeta potential the dts1070 micro electrophoresis cell was washed with dw before and after each measurement to prevent cross contamination before each measurement the dts1070 micro electrophoresis cell was moistened with the tested water and soil suspension thrice to ensure accuracy the zeta potentials of each sample were measured using a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano zse malvern germany 2 5 thermogravimetric analysis thermogravimetric analysis tga can be used to determine the water type free water fw loosely bound water lbw and tightly bound water tbw and their corresponding quantum of water on the surfaces of soil particles hou et al 2021b zhang et al 2018 because the loess used in this study is a clay type loess studying the transformation of water on loess particle surfaces under cacl2 solutions of varying concentrations based on tga helps explain the change behavior of saturated hydraulic conductivity previous studies have shown that when the moisture content is between the liquid limit and plastic limit most of the water in the clay soil is weakly bound water and a small amount is fw prost et al 1998 singh and wallender 2008 in this work 30 g of pretreated natural loess was sprayed with cacl2 solutions of varying concentrations to prepare samples with an initial moisture content of 25 after the sample box was sealed and allowed to stand for 24 h tga was conducted using an htc 3 comprehensive thermogravimetric analyzer the temperature was raised from 30 c to 250 c during the process of tga 2 6 grain size analysis the grain size distribution of loess after seepage was obtained to explore its response to cacl2 solutions of varying concentrations to this end 20 g of air dried loose soil from the center of the remolded loess sample after seepage was obtained and ground until 100 passed through a 2 mm sieve fully mixed samples weighing 5 g were pretreated as described by hou et al 2021a ultrasonic oscillation was conducted for 15 min after adding sodium hexametaphosphate which helps disperse soil particles following this the grain size distribution of loess was obtained 2 7 microstructure tests a variety of laboratory and imaging techniques have been developed to characterize soil microstructure rabot et al 2018 mip is a typical indirect method that is based on a simple principle and can be used to test a large range of pore sizes 3 nm to 500 μm and is very useful to describe a pore network and its size distribution romero 2013 wang et al 2020 in the mip measurement the column of 2 cm3 was cut carefully from central parts of loess samples which need to be first dried the changes in pore size distribution of loess samples were analyzed using a mercury intrusion porosimeter autopore iv 9500 and its principle was as follows washburn 1921 3 p 4 σ h g cos θ d where p is the mercury pressure σ hg is the surface tension of mercury 0 484 n m and θ is the contact angle between mercury and the pore wall 130 griffiths and joshi 1989 monroy et al 2010 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 as opposed to imaging techniques mip cannot characterize the morphology of soil microstructure however sem can be used to interpret soil microstructural morphology as it offers the advantage of geometric visualization rabot et al 2018 in this work soil columns with a diameter of 1 cm and a height of 2 cm were taken from loess samples which also need to be first dried the following operation process has been described in detail by xu et al 2021a the micrographs of soil microstructure were observed by a fei quanta 200 scanning electron microscope therefore mip and sem were used to evaluate the response of microscale structural characteristics of remolded loess to cacl2 solutions with varying concentrations 3 results 3 1 characteristics of ksat change the ksat of the remolded loess samples as a function of the concentrations of cacl2 solutions is shown in fig 4 the ksat increased as the concentration increased in the range of 0 0 005 mol l whereas it markedly decreased at the concentration of 0 01 mol l fig 4a the corresponding mean values during the whole seepage period were 1 50e 5 1 87e 5 2 27e 5 and 1 79e 5 cm s in general the addition of cacl2 to the infiltration solution enhances the ksat of remolded loess the ksat of the samples permeated with dw and 0 001 mol l cacl2 solution increased with time during seepage with the enhancement in the latter being more prominent the ksat of the sample under seepage with 0 005 mol l cacl2 solution increased for the first four days and stabilized afterwards as for 0 01 mol l cacl2 solution the ksat increased first and then decreased thus the ksat of remolded loess is sensitive to the concentrations of the cacl2 solutions 3 2 free swelling ratio the concentration of the cacl2 solution had a significant impact on the free swelling of loess as shown in table 2 the free swelling ratio of loess decreased as the ca2 concentration increased in the range of 0 0 01 mol l and the corresponding δef values are 14 76 14 29 11 22 and 9 59 for dw 0 001 mol l 0 005 mol l and 0 01 mol l cacl2 solutions due to the gradient in free energy caused by the elevated cation concentration water moved out of the interlayer area which was manifested at the macro scale as a reduction in the swelling of soil jo et al 2001 3 3 zeta potential the ζ p of loess particles versus the cacl2 concentration is presented in table 3 the ζ p changes from 10 53 mv for the 0 001 mol l cacl2 treated suspension to 7 20 mv for the 0 01 mol l cacl2 treated suspension however the ζ p of loess particles was more negative in dw 14 47 mv the ζ p of clay particles is a sign of its diffuse double layer thickness darrow et al 2020 thus the decrease in the absolute values of ζ p with increasing ca2 content could be attributed to the decrease in the thickness of the diffuse double layer caused by ca2 3 4 tga tga was performed on loess samples under cacl2 solutions of different concentrations and the variations in sample mass with increasing temperature namely the tg curves are presented in fig 5 the tg curves can be divided into three temperature intervals namely 60 c 60 110 c and 110 230 c which represent the thermogravimetric range of fw lbw and tbw respectively hou et al 2021b the contents of fw lbw and tbw are in the ranges of 3 53 4 71 20 40 18 54 and 1 71 2 39 respectively indicating that lbw is likely to be the dominant water type on the surfaces of loess particles as the cacl2 concentration increases the contents of fw and tbw increase whereas the lbw content decreases significantly this indicates that cacl2 mainly controls the engineering properties of loess by affecting the transformation of lbw 3 5 grain size analysis fig 6 shows the particle size distribution of loess after seepage of cacl2 solutions of varying concentrations all samples are dominated by silt with proportions in the range of 81 32 81 96 the proportions of clay and sand are in the range of 12 55 13 23 and 4 83 6 09 respectively compared with the grain size distribution of the loess before seepage table 1 and fig 1 the contents of clay and silt increased after seepage while the content of sand decreased this trend became more significant as the cacl2 concentration increased therefore it can be inferred that the cacl2 solution causes strong chemical weathering and finely crushes loess particles 4 discussion 4 1 electrical double layer effect for soils with clay content exceeding 10 changes in pore water chemistry can have a considerable impact on soil properties gajo and maines 2007 xu et al 2021f zhang et al 2013 as shown in table 1 the loess used in this study contains 12 47 clay particles consequently the physicochemical effects induced by clay particles need to be considered in the schematic diagram of a remolded soil specimen structure fig 7 a the surface of the clay particles contains a layer of bound water which can reduce the volume of effective pores and hinder the flow of water ren et al 2016 xu et al 2021b the water outside the lbw layer is fw fig 7b li et al 2015 the edl has an important impact on the aforementioned properties of soils such as permeability darrow et al 2020 and expansibility ren et al 2019 zeta potential which characterizes the thickness of the edl is a critical parameter for explaining the process of change in the hydraulic properties of soil zeng et al 2020 therefore the distribution pattern of water on particles and particle dispersion characteristics are strongly controlled by edl thickness as shown in tables 2 and 3 the higher the c cacl 2 the less charged the loess particles and the lower the free swelling ratio of loess indicating that adsorption of ca2 compresses the edl and thereby inhibits the swelling of clay a strong negative correlation between the δef and ζ p was observed with the correlation coefficient r being 0 90 fig 8 thus the zeta potential strongly influences the expansion property furthermore δef and ζ p are strongly correlated with c cacl2 with r values of 0 98 and 0 87 respectively this further confirms the aforementioned phenomenon in addition the development of a thicker edl promotes the transformation from lbw to fw hou et al 2021b a strong positive correlation was observed between ζ p and fw r 0 81 whereas a strong negative correlation was seen between ζ p and lbw 1 00 fig 8 these results are in agreement with those obtained by hou et al 2021b in the present study an increase in the cacl2 concentration promotes the adsorption of ca2 and compresses the edl this reduces the swelling of clay which is conducive to the aggregation and compression of soil particles meanwhile the transformation from the lbw layer to the fw layer expands the space within which free gravity water can flow which should enhance soil permeability however the test results obtained with the remolded loess in this study are not completely consistent with this inference as shown in fig 8 the initial saturated hydraulic conductivity ki exhibits a strong positive relationship with c cacl2 r 0 77 ζ p r 0 95 and fw r 0 95 whereas it exhibits a strong negative relationship with δef r 0 96 and lbw r 0 94 the mean saturated hydraulic conductivity km exhibits similar statistical variation trends the final saturated hydraulic conductivity kf exhibits a weak inter relationship with δef r 0 014 ζ p r 0 27 and lbw r 0 26 compared with ki and km kf exhibits a different correlation with c cacl2 namely a negative correlation r 0 18 this is mainly caused by the difference in the ksat variation trend with time during the seepage period fig 4 for instance the ksat of remolded loess decreases significantly in the later stage under seepage of a 0 01 mol l cacl2 solution therefore in this study the cacl2 concentration alters the swelling of loess and the evolution of the water types on particle surfaces through the edl effect thereby significantly impacting the ksat in other words the initial saturated hydraulic conductivity increases as the cacl2 concentration increases clay particles having smaller ζ p values cause the compression of the edl resulting in an increase in space for fw and consequently enhancing permeability darrow et al 2020 xu et al 2021f water with a certain degree of binding capacity between pores and clay particles is relatively immobile this fraction of water is called bound water and occupies a certain amount of the available pore space zhu et al 2016 based on the electrical double layer theory the effective porosity of soil proposed by zhu et al 2016 is used to quantitatively characterize the change in effective pore space under different chemical solutions the formula is as follows 4 n e n 1 p bw 100 5 n g s ρ d g s 100 where n is the soil porosity ρd is the dry density of the soil sample g cm3 gs is the specific gravity of loess particles gs 2 71 ne is the effective porosity and pbw is the fraction of bound water as a uniform dry density was maintained in all remolded loess samples the initial porosity of the soil samples was the same and n was equal to 46 49 in this study however compared with deionized water the ki increases by 0 09 times 0 21 times and 0 17 times under the seepage of cacl2 solutions with concentrations of 0 001 0 005 and 0 01 mol l respectively the effective porosity of the soil sample shown in fig 9 increases as the cacl2 concentration increases which indicates that the ki essentially increases with the cacl2 concentration loess is rich in clay minerals xu et al 2021c during the process of sample saturation the ca2 in the solution and monovalent metal ions e g na on the surfaces of the clay minerals undergo significant exchange and adsorption compressing the electrical double layer and thus reducing the content of bound water 4 2 microstructural evolution the change in the permeability of remolded loess with time can be elucidated based on the evolution of the microstructure during the process of seepage microstructure is widely used to evaluate the physical and mechanical properties of soil and to reveal the relationship between the microstructure of soil and its macro scale behavior hou et al 2021b li et al 2019b xiao et al 2022 to date research has shown that the initial microstructure cannot sufficiently explain the subsequent changes in soil properties wang et al 2019 xu et al 2021e the micro scale change mechanism of permeability can be elucidated by comparing the microstructure before and after seepage xu et al 2020 zuo et al 2020 4 2 1 microstructural morphology the microstructure of loess can essentially be described based on particle patterns contact relations cementations and pore forms these parameters are interdependent and are widely used in the study of the engineering properties of loess hou et al 2021c li et al 2019b xie et al 2018 xu et al 2021a skeletal particles are the pillars of the loess structural system and their contact relations mainly include point contact and face cementation carbonates and clay particles play the role of cementation in loess which is vital to the stability of skeleton structure xie et al 2018 the interaction of the three generates inter aggregate pores and intra aggregate pores the inter aggregate pores can be further classified as spaced pores and intergranular pores shao et al 2018 observation of the microstructure of loess can help understand the mechanisms by which different cacl2 solutions affect permeability sem microphotographs presented in fig 10 show the soil structure of the remolded loess specimens before and after seepage prior to seepage a large number of clay and fine particles are attached to the surfaces of coarse particles forming a uniform and dispersed structure fig 10a the remolding process of loess destroys the connections between the soil particles and the soil microstructure becomes dissipative wang et al 2021a as for the samples after seepage fine particles agglomerate into larger particles leading to the formation of larger pore spaces fig 10b c and d this is mainly due to the decrease in electrostatic repulsion and the increase in van der waals s attractive forces between clay particles caused by the adsorption of ca2 this is further confirmed by the wide distribution of larger aggregates also confirms this reason cations can control the flocculation of particles and the development of pore spaces by altering the edl thickness darrow et al 2020 xu et al 2021b zhang et al 2014 as reported by zuo et al 2020 larger aggregate sizes and fewer fine particles yield larger voids in the soil and consequently enhance permeability as shown in fig 4 the ksat of the samples permeated with dw and 0 001 mol l cacl2 solution increased with time the ksat of the sample permeated with 0 005 mol l cacl2 solution first increased and then stabilized moreover the kf values of the samples were significantly higher than the ki values and kf increased with the c cacl2 compared with other loess specimens the sample infiltrated with 0 01 mol l cacl2 solution had more cement between coarse particles and the distribution of intra aggregate pores was wider the degree of pore development was relatively weak fig 10e this may be because the high concentration of ca2 inhibited the dissolution of the carbonate cement and even caused carbonate precipitation the contents of clay and silt increased after seepage while the sand content decreased this change trend became more prominent as the cacl2 concentration increased fig 6 c cacl2 had a strong positive relationship with clay r 0 78 and silt contents r 0 98 whereas it had a strong negative relationship with sand content r 0 96 as shown in fig 8 thus solutions with high concentrations of cacl2 possess strong chemical differentiation and exhibit a high possibility of damage to coarse particles resulting in larger quantities of fine and clay particles for example the soil sample after seepage of a 0 01 mol l cacl2 solution shows many fine particles in a dispersed contact state fig 10e which corroborates the change in particle distribution shown in fig 8 therefore the corresponding permeability decreases significantly during the later stage of seepage 4 2 2 pore size distribution fig 11 presents the pore size distribution of samples before and after seepage using semi logarithmic scales the cumulative pore volumes of specimens after seepage of the different cacl2 solutions are higher than that of the original sample this is especially true for the sample subjected to seepage of the 0 005 mol l cacl2 solution fig 11a this can be explained based on the leaching action which increases the pore space during the seepage process xu et al 2021c the pore size density curves exhibit two peaks fig 11b an identical dominant diameter ranging from 0 01 to 0 07 μm occurs in the region of the micro pore series indicating that seepage has a negligible effect on the family of intra aggregate pores for the macro pore series the particle size distribution of remolded loess before seepage exhibits a major peak around 9 05 μm whereas the dominant macro pore sizes are 13 94 μm 11 33 μm 24 10 μm and 11 33 μm for dw and cacl2 solutions with concentrations of 0 001 0 005 and 0 01 mol l respectively the peak position was observed to shift to the left under varying degrees after seepage indicating that the pores in the loess samples could develop during the process of seepage the observations indicate that the ksat of soil samples is dominantly influenced by macro pore i e inter aggregate pores sizes 4 3 mechanism underlying changes in saturated permeability for the remolded loess samples subjected to dw and the 0 001 mol l cacl2 solution the saturated permeability increased continuously with time with the increase in the latter being more prominent ca2 can substitute the monovalent cations on the surface of clay mineral particles leading to a decreases in the thickness of electrical double layer and bound water and hence the increase of effective porosity zhu et al 2016 besides the addition of low concentration inorganic salts in the water flow can also promote the dissolution of soil components thus enhancing the leaching effect and developing pores xu et al 2021b so the electrical double layer effect and chemical leaching were the dominant factors and induced the distribution of effective pores which enhanced permeability with a greater degree for 0 001 mol l cacl2 solution the microstructure shown in fig 10 verifies the above phenomenon the ksat of the sample permeated with 0 01 mol l cacl2 solution first increased and then decreased with the decrease being more prominent as mentioned earlier a thinner edl promotes the enhancement of permeability the core function of cation exchange and adsorption is to change the structure of the electric double layer darrow et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 and this action gradually weakens as the seepage process progresses xu et al 2021c moreover the fragmentation of coarse particles sand particles not only reduces the stability of the skeleton structure but may also induce the collapse of the soil structure the generated fine particles adhere to the particles surrounding the pores reducing the connectivity of the pores in addition a large amount of ca2 can inhibit the dissolution of carbonate minerals and even induce precipitation as shown in fig 10e the distribution of intra aggregate pores of soil sample after seepage was wider and the degree of pore development was relatively weak meanwhile the pore volume and the peak value of the pore size density are low after seepage fig 11b which serves as evidence of the aforementioned water and soil action mechanism therefore the permeability increases at early stage of seepage and decreases significantly during the later stage of seepage it is worth mentioning that the ksat of the sample subjected to seepage of the 0 005 mol l cacl2 solution first increased and later stabilized this trend of change in permeability could represent the transition type of the above two phenomena during the initial stage the reason for the increase of permeability is similar to that mentioned earlier namely the electrical double layer effect and chemical leaching were the dominant factors to enhance soil permeability during the stage of stabilization the effective pores of the soil sample are in a state of dynamic equilibrium under the combined influence of the electrical double layer effect geochemical action and microstructural evolution 4 4 comparison with other soils the underlying mechanism responsible for changes in the saturated permeability of remolded loess subjected to cacl2 solution of varying concentrations was summarized in this study the electrical double layer effect and chemical interactions are the dominant factors that cause the evolution of microstructure and change the anti seepage performance of soil lower swell and higher initial hydraulic conductivity of loess were basically associated with an increase in concentration of cacl2 solution which is generally consistent with the research conclusions of other types of soil for instance geosynthetic clay liners gcls were used as hydraulic barriers in liner and cover systems for waste containment facilities with the increase of cacl2 concentration from 0 005 mol l to 1 mol l its hydraulic conductivity increased about 104 times jo et al 2001 in addition compared with the tap water the permeability of clay based cutoff walls permeated with 0 2 mol l cacl2 solution was higher zhu et al 2016 and zhu et al 2016 found the replacement reaction between calcium ions in the permeate and monovalent metal cations adsorbed on the surface of clay mineral particles results in the thinning of the diffusion double layer the increase of effective porosity and the enhancement of permeability furthermore the hydraulic conductivity of bentonite filter cakes also increased with an increase in cacl2 concentrations 5 10 15 20 40 60 mmol l during the test period of 30 min which may be because the connected pores between bentonite aggregates increase and become unblocked shen et al 2016 therefore the findings in this study have broad application value to other soils although little attention has been paid to the change law and mechanism of long term permeability of soil this study can provide a new perspective for the research on the alteration of anti seepage performance of other contaminated soils 5 conclusions saturated hydraulic conductivity in remolded loess under the effects of cacl2 solutions of varying concentrations was investigated experimentally in this study for this purpose remolded loess samples were obtained using a wet compaction method a series of cacl2 solutions were prepared and saturated permeability tests were carried out the electrical double layer edl effect was evaluated using the zeta potential thermogravimetric analysis and the free swelling ratio microstructural evolution was qualitatively and quantitatively investigated using scanning electron microscopy mercury intrusion porosimetry and grain size analysis the following conclusions can be drawn the saturated permeability of remolded loess is sensitive to the concentration of cacl2 solutions the initial ksat increased with as the cacl2 concentration increased primarily due to the edl effect and chemical dissolution however there were significant differences in the variation trend of permeability with time the ksat of the samples under seepage of dw and the 0 001 mol l cacl2 solution increased with time during the seepage process the electrical double layer effect induced by ca2 controlled the flocculation between particles and the development of the pore structure it also promoted the transformation of lbw to free gravity water enhancing the distribution of effective pores the addition of low concentration cacl2 solution can also promote the dissolution of soil components thus enhancing the leaching effect and developing pores thus under seepage of the 0 001 mol l cacl2 solution the increase in saturated permeability was greater than that under seepage of dw under seepage of the high concentration cacl2 solution coarse particles sand easily disintegrated into fine particles clay and silt which could reduce the stability of the skeleton structure and the connectivity of pores meanwhile the high concentration of ca2 inhibited the dissolution of carbonates which was not conducive to the development of pores moreover as the cation alternating adsorption gradually weakens during the seepage process the edl effect did not have a major effect on the change in permeability therefore the ksat of the sample permeated with the 0 01 mol l cacl2 solution first increased and then significantly decreased the ksat of the sample permeated with the 0 005 mol l cacl2 solution first increased and then stabilized which could represent the transition type of the above two phenomena the reason for the increase of permeability is similar to that mentioned earlier namely the edl effect and chemical leaching during the stage of stabilization the effective pores in the soil sample were in a state of dynamic equilibrium under the combined influence of the edl effect geochemical action and microstructural evolution these findings in this study which have broad application value to other soils are expected to provide a scientific basis for preventing the diffusion of pollutants in geotechnical environments and improving the safety of engineering structures credit authorship contribution statement panpan

by comparing the zmk value with z α 2 if z mk z α 2 there is a trend formation where z α 2 2 576 implies very strong trend at 99 confidence interval whereas z α 2 1 96 a strong trend exists at 95 confidence interval z α 2 1 645 indicates moderate trend at 90 confidence interval and finally z α 2 1 282 is for weak trend at 80 confidence interval confidence intervals of 90 and above are preferred in trend analysis studies dinpashoh et al 2011 however in this study 80 confidence interval is also used in order to obtain better compare the proposed method with mk test but trend

where xj and xk are time series values at time instances j and k respectively from a given time series x1 x2 xk xj xn with n observations the sign of the comparison is determined with eq 4 a value of 1 1 is given for positive negative trend appearance and 0 implies neutral case herein the values whose sign is determined are added together with eq 3 to obtain the s value the ita method şen 2012 provides great advantages by visually defining the monotonic or non monotonic trend identification and is very easy to implement any given time series with n elements is divided in half by y 1 n 2 x 1 x 2 x n 2 and y 2 n 2 x n 2 1 x n 2 2 x n then both series are ordered from minimum to maximum or from maximum to minimum as notationally shown in eq 5 şen 2012 5 r 1 min y 1 n 2 y i max y 1 n 2 1 i n

and a straight line with a slope of 1 1 is drawn on the same diagram if the data falls on this straight line it can be judged that there is no trend otherwise if all of the data is above below the 1 1 line there is a monotonically increasing decreasing trend apart from these alternatives there are also is a transition from a decreasing increasing region to an increasing decreasing region which is called a partially increasing decreasing non monotonic trend all these alternatives are presented in fig 1 the wilcoxon test tries to test whether the scatter of two variables is the same by considering the differences in the two half data for this purpose the differences between the half observations are calculated according to eq 6 by taking the absolute values as in eq 7 lee and kang 2015 these absolute values are ordered from smallest to greatest with given sequence numbers the sum of the marked rows is taken as t t which is the sum of the plus signed minus signed ordinals the summation is given by eq 8 according to karagöz 2019 as follows 6 d i x i y i 7 d i x i y i 8 t t t herein d i is the difference between the first half data x i and the second half data y i the zw in eq 9 is the test statistic value for wilcoxon that helps to identify trend conditions according to z α 2 value for two tail the distribution standard deviation value is σ t and the arithmetic mean

method first the data is divided into two halves as in the ita method but they are not ordered the visual difference from the ita diagram using the same data is shown in fig 2 the wilcoxon test which takes into account the differences of data belonging to non ordered halves is used for statistical analysis finally the trend state is determined visually as in fig 2 and numerically with the test statistic value zw 3 study area and data turkey have four climate types between subtropical and temperate zones it is rainy in all seasons on the black sea coastal areas throughout the year due to the humid air mass affecting the black sea region fig 3 the mediterranean climate is rainy warm in winters and dry hot in summers the mediterranean climate is always dominant by the southern and western coastal parts of turkey the marmara region has a transitional climate between the black sea and the mediterranean sea the coastal areas of the marmara sea connecting the black sea and the aegean sea are rainy in winter cool cold and moderately dry warm hot in summer finally continental climate type is dominant in most of central eastern and southeastern anatolia with snowy cold winters and dry hot summers general directorate for state hydraulic works dsi devlet su isleri in turkish measured the data at yakabaşı söğütlühan arıcılar and topluca stations for 50 years see table 1 and fig 3 there is no dam or a water structure affecting the regime of the flow in the upstream parts of all stations the data are annual minimum average and maximum discharge values m3 s measured with a limnigraph the maximum discharge is obtained instantaneously throughout the year the annual average value is calculated using 365 day averages and the annual minimum measurement is selected as the lowest value of 365 day averages statistical parameters such as mean median standard deviation maximum and minimum values of the data sets including standard deviation kurtosis skewness and pearson s correlation coefficient r are presented in table 2 especially arıcılar minimum arıcılar average and yakabaşı maximum data sets have serial correlation with 5 significance level and pre whitening procedure von storch 1995 kulkarni and von storch 1995 are applied to them 4 results and discussion it is necessary to examine whether time series data is from the same cluster there are several methods that test the homogeneity of any time series one of the most used is the runs test swed eisenhart 1943 the hypothesis in this test is that the data in the same time series come from the same cluster and are homogeneous before the application of the test the median value is found then it is checked whether the data in the time series are above or below the median after these calculations the test value is calculated from eq 11 swed and eisenhart 1943 11 z r r 2 n a n u n a n u 1 2 n a n u 2 n a n u n n 2 n 1 where r is the number of runs n a is the number of below median values n u is the number of above median and n is the data number the homogeneity of three different discharge data sets minimum maximum and average measured at four stations is checked by subjecting them to the runs test as a result of the calculations made according to 5 significance level all the data are homogeneous table 3 an outlier which is the value that excludes a certain range in the data set causes some confusion for input output models but does not affect sign tests although sign tests are used in this study outliers will be detected by interquartile range iqr method kannan et al 2015 to show the data set characteristics an outlier is detected according to eq 12 eq 13 if any point lies below lower bound above upper bound 12 lowerbound q 1 1 5 q 3 q 1 q 1 1 5 i q r 13 higherbound q 3 1 5 q 3 q 1 q 3 1 5 i q r herein q1 is first quartile value q3 is third quartile value and iqr value q3 q1 the iqr method is applied to the 12 data sets used in the study and some outliers shown in fig 4 are detected and verified by dsi which obtained them fifty years of data are considered for the application and maximum minimum and average discharge measurements are analyzed the first half covers the 25 years between 1966 and 1990 while the second next half has 1991 2015 periods the first half time series are sorted in ascending order and subjected to the trend test with the ita method accordingly the non ordered half time series are scattered in the same graph containing the 1 1 straight line thus the suggested method can be compared graphically with the ita method in addition non ordered data divided into two halves are tested with wilcoxon 1945 and z w values are found thus the results can be compared with the classical mk test data obtained from yakabaşı söğütlühan topluca and arıcılar stations on the northern line of turkey are used for the application and comparison with the proposed study the graphical visualization is obtained similar to the ita methodology and the trends are detected in confidence interval like the mk test because the wilcoxon signed rank test is integrated with the proposed approach the test is a highly reliable and considers the differences between matched halves according to ita approach and the recommended graphical method the visual presentations are given in figs 5 and 6 the trend conditions are obtained and comparisons are made visually between the ita and proposed methodologies another feature of the suggested graphical method can be combined with the wilcoxon test thus a full comparison is made with the mk test via confidence interval table 4 visible negative trends are seen in the maximum fig 5a and average fig 5c data of yakabaşı station according to ita but it is not possible to make an assessment in terms of significance level on the other hand since the minimum data are mostly arranged around the 1 1 line fig 5b it can easily be said that there is no trend there are differences in significance although the suggested graphic supports visually the ita results given the wilcoxon significance level applied to non ordered data there is full overlap for the maximum values but there is no trend according to the significance levels of the trend for the minimum and average values the negative decreasing trend decision is made for the maximum and average values according to the classical mk test at the 1 and 5 significance levels respectively thus ita visual results for yakabaşı maximum and minimum values are supported by mk and wilcoxon tests results table 4 the ita method indicates the decreasing trend for all data types of söğütlühan station fig 5d e and f considering that the average and maximum data are non ordered it also reflects the decreasing trends visually the maximum values are slightly below the 20 significance level while the average values support the decreasing trend result at 10 wilcoxon significance level table 4 the scatter of ordered and non ordered minimum values around the 1 1 line is supported by both wilcoxon and mk tests with no trend decision the decreasing trends of maximum and average measurements were revealed at the significance level 20 according to the mk test table 4 all data types of arıcılar station evaluated by the ita method have a decreasing trend fig 6a b and c the visualizations obtained from the graph of the non ordered data overlap with the ita results but wilcoxon significance level is calculated very strongly for the minimum data only table 4 significance levels of the decreasing trend are weak 20 for the remaining data according to the mk test results while a strong decreasing trend like wilcoxon test emerged in the minimum data no significant trend is detected for the maximum and average data collectively the average data of topluca station has an increasing trend over all the three methods outputs fig 6f and table 4 but there is no trend in the minimum data fig 6e and table 4 although there is a 20 significance level 80 confidence interval with the mk test no trend decision is made for the maximum values of topluca station fig 6e and table 4 fig 7 is given for the comparison of zmk and zw values according to the confidence interval of the discharge data from 80 to 99 only the topluca average and yakabaşı maximum data show a significant trend according to the results of both tests generally no significant trend was observed in the northern line of turkey finally calculated zmk and zw values are negative except for topluca station data fig 7 it may be possible to talk about a risk for yakabaşı in terms of water resources but this is not a problem for any station in terms of flooding as a result non ordered data scattering on the graph containing the 1 1 line were evaluated visually as in the ita approach in addition after the combination of wilcoxon test and this graph non parametric evaluation such as mk test is performed the ita approach şen 2012 compares the ordered time series halves on the graph with each other and allows verbal interpretation on the other hand the mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 reveals the existence of a trend according to a certain confidence interval some researchers using şen s simple ita method tried to digitize the results and compare it with the mk test şen 2014 2017a b dabanlı et al 2016 alashan 2018 however all digitization processes vary according to the comments of the researchers and cannot be fully compared with the mk test the scattering of the non ordered data on the graph containing the 1 1 line allowed comparison with the ita method at the same time the combination of the suggested approach and wilcoxon 1945 test is fully compared with the mk test for the first time according to the same confidence intervals significance levels 5 conclusion the aim of the study is to determine the trends of minimum average and maximum discharge values obtained from runoff stations of 4 rivers in the northern part of turkey with an alternative and useful methodological approach in the proposed methodology the advantage of graphical representation of the ita ordered method is used but differently non ordered scatter diagrams are also drawn with the same data sets in addition wilcoxon signed rank test which considers the differences between the paired data groups for the proposed method showed numerically whether the scattering of the two variables is the same thus it is possible to reach numerical trend values as well as graphical display the second purpose of the current study is to determine the suitability of the proposed method for this purpose trend values are assessed by other methods ita and mk too the suggested graphical representation visually supports the ita results but there is a difference in terms of significance level zw values are calculated to reveal this difference numerically for the comparison with the mk test zmk and zw values are considered and checked according to 80 90 95 and 99 confidence intervals 20 10 5 and 1 significance levels this comparison showed that the evaluations of 95 and above are similar for all trend formations except yakabaşı average flow data the findings clearly indicated that 10 out of 12 tests are compatible with mk taken together the results suggest that 8 out of 12 tests did not have trend formation of the remaining 4 analyzes only an increasing trend is found in the average discharge values of the topluca station in addition decreasing trends are detected in the maximum discharge values of the yakabaşı station the minimum discharge values of the arıcılar station and the average discharge values of the yakabaşı station as a result it seems that there may be a risk for yakabaşı in terms of water resources but none of the station is risky in terms of flooding credit authorship contribution statement kemal saplıoğlu conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology resources validation

3234,in this study time series data is divided into two equal parts as in the basic principle of the innovative trend analysis ita method however unlike the ita the data are not ordered when comparing the halves to avoid any change in the time series wilcoxon signed rank test is used to consider the differences between the two equal halves and to determine if there is any trend in time series a graphical presentation is provided like ita approach and is expressed as the mann kendall mk test for trend detection at a given confidence interval significance level in the application phase minimum maximum and average discharge time series measured at yakabaşı söğütlühan arıcılar and topluca stations along the northern line from west to east of turkey are used the trend conditions of the data are determined by the proposed method and compared with ita and mk tests results no trend is observed in 8 out of 12 cases for stations at the 95 confidence interval while decreasing trends are detected in the maximum discharge of yakabaşı station the minimum discharge of arıcılar station and the average discharge of yakabaşı station an increasing trend is detected in the average discharge records of topluca station here an easy to use model for decision makers is proposed that presents numerical as well as graphical analyses of trend identification studies keywords discharge mann

to human activities affects hydrological and meteorological variables as a decreasing or increasing trend component the impact of climate change causes extreme events such as drought and floods which are especially important for water resources management trend analysis studies are essential for water resources management risk assessment planning and design recently different trend types have been detected in hydrological and meteorological data such as precipitation temperature and discharge measured in different parts of the world the mann 1945 kendall 1975 mk test slope estimator sen 1968 and linear regression analysis haan 1977 are important trend determination approaches and are widely used in the literature taylor and loftis 1989 used eight different trend tests for groundwater and

procedure is implemented by ghate and timbadiya 2021 to partial duration and annual maximum precipitation series in the literature graphical trend analyses have been made via şen s ita by using ordered data so far the main goal of current study is to identify trends with non parametric wilcoxon 1945 matching test for any time series divided two halves without ordering as a result graphical presentations lead to trend detection within a certain confidence interval such as the mk test for the application of this study flow discharge data measured at yakabaşı söğütlühan arıcılar and topluca stations along the northern line from the east to the west of turkey are used trend conditions are identified and the proposed method is compared with the classical ita and mk test methodologies 2 methodology the non parametric mk trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 is widely used to evaluate the significance of monotonic trends in time series according to this methodology the zmk should be checked by eq 1 to express the increasing or decreasing trends in a given time series positive negative zmk values indicate increasing decreasing trends the trend formation can be understood by comparing the zmk value with z α 2 if z mk z α 2 there is a trend formation where z α 2 2 576 implies very strong trend at 99 confidence interval whereas z α 2 1 96 a strong trend exists at 95 confidence interval z α 2 1 645 indicates moderate trend at 90 confidence interval and finally z α 2 1 282 is for weak trend at 80 confidence interval confidence intervals of 90 and above are preferred in trend analysis studies dinpashoh et al 2011 however in this study 80 confidence interval is also used in order to obtain better compare the proposed method with mk test but trend decisions are made according to 95 5 confidence interval significance level 1 z mk s 1 v s f o r s 0 0 f o r s 0 s 1 v s f o r s 0 additionally full consideration of mk trend test application requires

where xj and xk are time series values at time instances j and k respectively from a given time series x1 x2 xk xj xn with n observations the sign of the comparison is determined with eq 4 a value of 1 1 is given for positive negative trend appearance and 0 implies neutral case herein the values whose sign is determined are added together with eq 3 to obtain the s value the ita method şen 2012 provides great advantages by visually defining the monotonic or non monotonic trend identification and is very easy to implement any given time series with n elements is divided in half by y 1 n 2 x 1 x 2 x n 2 and y 2 n 2 x n 2 1 x n 2 2 x n then both series are ordered from minimum to maximum or from maximum to minimum as notationally shown in eq 5 şen 2012 5 r 1 min y 1 n 2 y i max y 1 n 2 1 i n

and a straight line with a slope of 1 1 is drawn on the same diagram if the data falls on this straight line it can be judged that there is no trend otherwise if all of the data is above below the 1 1

significant trend was observed in the northern line of turkey finally calculated zmk and zw values are negative except for topluca station data fig 7 it may be possible to talk about a risk for yakabaşı in terms of water resources but this is not a problem for any station in terms of flooding as a result non ordered data scattering on the graph containing the 1 1 line were evaluated visually

series halves on the graph with each other and allows verbal interpretation on the other hand the mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 reveals the existence of a trend according to a certain confidence interval some researchers using şen s simple ita method tried to digitize the results and compare it with the mk test şen 2014 2017a b dabanlı et al 2016 alashan 2018 however all digitization processes vary according to the comments of the researchers and cannot be fully compared with the mk test the scattering of the non ordered data on the graph containing the 1 1 line allowed comparison with the ita method at the same time the combination of the suggested approach and wilcoxon 1945 test is fully compared with the mk test for the first time according to the same confidence intervals significance levels 5 conclusion the aim of the study is to determine the trends of minimum average and maximum discharge values obtained from runoff stations of 4 rivers in the northern part of turkey with an alternative and useful methodological approach in the proposed methodology the advantage of graphical representation of the ita ordered method is used but differently non ordered scatter diagrams are also drawn with the same data sets in addition wilcoxon signed rank test which considers the differences between the paired data groups for the proposed method showed numerically whether the scattering of the two variables is the same thus it is possible to reach numerical trend values as well as graphical display the second purpose of the current study is to determine the suitability of the proposed method for this purpose trend values are assessed by other methods ita and mk too the suggested graphical representation visually supports the ita results but there is a difference in terms of significance level zw values are calculated to reveal this difference numerically for the comparison with the mk test zmk and zw values are considered and checked according to 80 90 95 and 99 confidence intervals 20 10 5 and 1 significance levels this comparison showed that the evaluations of 95 and above are similar for all trend formations except yakabaşı average flow data the findings clearly indicated that 10 out of 12 tests are compatible with mk taken together the results suggest that 8 out of 12 tests did not have trend formation of the remaining 4 analyzes only an increasing trend is found in the average discharge values of the topluca station in addition decreasing trends are detected in the maximum discharge values of the yakabaşı station the minimum discharge values of the arıcılar station and the average discharge values of the yakabaşı station as a result it seems that there may be a risk for yakabaşı in terms of water resources but none of the station is risky in terms of flooding credit authorship contribution statement kemal saplıoğlu conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology resources validation
