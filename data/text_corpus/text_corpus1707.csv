8535,available methods to quantify the recharge of karst aquifers usually rely on spatially and temporally aggregated precipitation measurements and simplified recharge models employing transfer functions to account for the delay in infiltration and the distribution in time and space they generally neglect the non linear nature of infiltration dynamics through the vadose zone characterized by dual flow behavior with slow diffuse and rapid focused recharge components here we present a methodology that accounts for the physics of flow by employing a variably saturated dual permeability flow model to simulate diffuse and preferential infiltration in a large scale carbonate aquifer the western mountain aquifer wma in israel and the west bank was selected as a suitable groundwater basin because of the large thickness of the vadose zone extending over several hundred meters the availability of long term data as well as the catchment size stretching across a catchment area of circa 9000km2 together these characteristics allow the identification and quantification of the spatio temporal distribution of the infiltration recharge component assessed at the level of the groundwater table the presented methodology allows for improved water resources planning and generalization of the results i e the robustness of large scale model results with respect to local hydraulic parameter variations and data uncertainty semi arid climate regions with a highly pronounced seasonality of precipitation and intense short duration rainfalls such as the mediterranean region represent a prime study location because of the clear and pronounced recharge input signals that are not superimposed by summer rainstorms we simulate the complex dynamics of the dual domain infiltration and partitioning of the precipitation input signal by employing hydrogeosphere hgs for transient variably saturated water flow flow in the limestone rock matrix and high porosity system i e conduits and fractures is modeled by overlapping individual continua based on the bulk effective richards equation with van genuchten vg parameters keywords variably saturated dual permeability flow modeling

made available on request 1 introduction highly heterogeneous flow dynamics characterize karst aquifers in all compartments i e the land surface the vadose and the phreatic zone the heterogeneous distribution of hydraulic properties e g hydraulic conductivity storage within the compartments affects the local and global routing dynamics and hence the magnitude and dissipation of the hydraulic signal between the source precipitation and recharge and spring outlet jeannin and sauter 1998 smart and hobbs 1986 in particular under semi arid climates with pronounced precipitation seasonality i e dry summer and humid winter a thick vadose zone may provide substantial storage to infiltrating water geyer et al 2008 liu et al 2021 schmidt et al 2014 and storage may vary significantly in time and space however the role of the vadose zone is often neglected or only accounted for by employing simple linear transfer functions in catchment scale numerical simulations furthermore a complex interplay between non linear processes with superimposing effects shapes storage in the vadose zone i e the initial state of saturation controls matric suction and storage capacity requiring process based approaches to account for the distributed infiltration through the vadose zone this study demonstrates a complex process based method a variably saturated dual permeability flow model to assess infiltration dynamics and storage in the vadose zone for the western mountain aquifer wma in israel and the west bank the reasoning for selecting this aquifer is that it provides 1 a highly complex karst environment including multi domain heterogeneities in the phreatic and vadose zone 2 a large catchment size with effects of distributive hydrological input and 3 at the same time the integrated hydraulic response at the taninim spring which reflects the entire catchment dynamics in addition semi arid climates exhibit a pronounced seasonality of precipitation and intense short duration rainfalls and therefore can provide clear and pronounced recharge input signals not superimposed by summer rainstorms the unambiguous signal allows for analyzing the contribution of the vadose zone to the delayed dissipation of the hydraulic discharge response to rainstorm events the large catchment size of the wma with 9000km2 ascertains that small scale heterogeneity in hydraulic properties and spatial variability in the distribution of precipitation are averaged out in the integrated response at the spring i e the robustness of large scale model results concerning local hydraulic parameter variations and data uncertainty also the wma is highly relevant to the water supply of israel and the west bank a process based approach improves model validity in long term predictive simulations furthermore it allows for the extraction of information about the time variant moisture distribution within the thick vadose zone hence providing a tool to improve groundwater management strategies for highly stressed aquifer systems for instance fig 2 shows the effect of very wet years e g 1973 74 1991 92 on the long term recession of spring discharge at the auja spring west bank and groundwater hydrographs in the recharge area despite the auja spring being located outside the wma in the jordan valley and belonging to the adjacent eastern mountain aquifer ema the hydraulic response of the auja spring can be considered representative of the wma since the wma and ema share a common recharge area and similar geological units however the signal in the ema is not perturbed by the effects of intensive groundwater abstraction high discharge and groundwater tables were recorded for several years even though recharge was considerably less this observation implies groundwater recharge is stored in either the vadose or the phreatic zone therefore the most appropriate method to investigate the coupled process of infiltration recharge and groundwater flow is the discrete simulation of the hydraulically coupled phreatic and vadose zone considering their respective duality in flow behavior the superposition of rapid recharge via fractures and dissolution features i e dolines shafts and long term diffuse infiltration via the limestone rock matrix domain must be accounted for when addressing the storage dynamics in the following we briefly discuss the existing groundwater flow and recharge models of the wma and describe the applications and merits of the presented model presently existing flow models for the wma calculate fully saturated flow and parameterize the model by employing a single bulk effective continuum i e a lumped matrix fracture conduit continuum e g berger 1999 dafny et al 2010 abusaada 2011 however a saturated single continuum flow model can not account for the storage effect of a several hundred meter thick vadose zone and preferential infiltration pathways moreover a dual permeability model can better reproduce the temporal dynamics of event based spring discharge and local groundwater table responses characterized by a rapid rise after rainfall and gradual and extended recessions for instance abusaada and sauter 2017 represent the vertical aquifer layer structure spatially lumped by applying an accentuated hydraulic anisotropy where the low vertical hydraulic conductivity reflects aquitards and the vadose zone the appropriate choice of process consideration depends on the study objective prevailing flow processes and site specific characteristics this study aims to provide a tool to assess distributed vadose and phreatic storage dynamics on a regional scale and therefore requires the consideration of vadose flow processes vadose flow processes gain further importance when the numerical model is applied to assess the effects of climate change and unsustainable groundwater abstraction likely scaling up the temporal delay because of a thicker vadose zone in addition recharge to the wma is quantified in most previous studies by linear regression models between annual precipitation or the precipitation in the recharge effective winter months and annual recharge berger 1999 weiss and gvirtzman 2007 abusaada 2011 neglecting the intra annual variability of rainfall for instance abusaada 2011 computed annual recharge i e defined as input at the level of the groundwater table based on a linear regression between precipitation during the recharge effective winter months and subsequently accounted for the transfer through the vadose zone by an empirically obtained normalized recharge curve on a monthly time step the recharge curve is the median seasonal water table fluctuation over multiple years dafny et al 2010 define the recharge flux at a fixed fraction of the annual precipitation while the above methods have their merits e g simplicity parsimony of applied parameters and lesser demand on data they do not account for the spatio temporal distribution of precipitation recharge and infiltration therefore they can not be employed to predict future recharge and storage dynamics for different climatic conditions sheffer et al 2010 provide an approach to assess distributed recharge to the wma based on a daily soil water balance model for three soil types i e terra rossa rendzina and desert coupled with a monthly groundwater flow model fully saturated however this approach neglects the storage and delaying effect of the vadose zones and the dual domain flow dynamics furthermore the recharge area of the wma is characterized by a large proportion of exposed bare carbonate rock providing potential pathways for rapid infiltration into the consolidated formations dvory et al 2016 and dvory et al 2018 have considered the vadose flow processes at the local scale by employing a 2 dimensional dual permeability infiltration model for a smaller sub catchment of the wma i e the soreq catchment this study accounts for infiltration and vadose storage dynamics at the catchment scale by employing a variably saturated dual permeability flow model we discretize the rock matrix and secondary porosity i e conduits and fractures as separate overlapping continua flow is computed via the bulk effective richards equation with van genuchten vg parameters to model flow in karstified limestone rock material with rapid flow through conduits and slow flow through the rock matrix in the vadose and the phreatic zone the individual continua transfer water based on a first order exchange term across a coupling interface with a coupling length and a conductance as controlling parameters the applied model accounts for short term recharge essential in climate zones characterized by pronounced seasonality i e semi arid climates furthermore preferential flow paths enhance accentuated recharge through the vadose zone climate simulations for israel and west bank suggest an increased frequency of extreme rain events and an overall decrease in annual precipitation because of climate change bucchignani et al 2018 hochman et al 2018 adinolfi et al 2020 further emphasizing dynamic infiltration characteristics their combined effects on vadose zone storage and the necessity to account for appropriate modeling techniques 2 methods and model construction in order to investigate the above characteristics of the effect of thick unsaturated zones on the spatio temporal variation of recharge observed at the level of the groundwater table with the endeavor of being able to obtain generalizable results a study area has to be selected that is large enough to minimize effects of small scale catchment specifics this catchment was found in the eastern mediterranean i e the western mountain aquifer wma the wma extends over an area of circa 9000km2 in israel and the west bank and is bordered by the carmel mountains in the north the sinai desert in the south the mediterranean coastline in the west and the samarian and judaean mountains in the east see fig 1 the aquifer comprises late albian turonian judea group lithofacies representing a shallow water carbonate platform sequence of the tethys sass and bein 1982 braun and hirsch 1994 limestone and dolomite with interbedded terrigenous marl and chalk are predominant see fig 3 high salinity within the local shelf basins favored the deposition of dolomite sass and bein 1982 the present coastal strip is aligned with the western edge of this platform interbedded terrigenous sediments of lower permeability increase in percentual proportions of the rock sequence landwards creating locally perched aquifers in the recharge area weiss and gvirtzman 2007 dafny et al 2010 dvory et al 2016 towards the west the shallow water carbonate facies judea group transition to non permeable deep water chalky marls facies talme yafe formation separating the wma from the mediterranean sea for the most part saltwater intrusion only occurs through a thin interface at the north western edge of the aquifer where an underlying saltwater body partially mixes with fresh water from the aquifer at a rate of approximately 3 7 106m3a 1 dafny et al 2010 abusaada 2011 yechieli et al 2019 the aquifer is unconfined in the east and confined in the west by pelagic chalks marl and siliceous sediments of the mount scopus and saqiye group weinberger et al 1994 dafny et al 2010 low permeable layers of marl clay and shale of the aptian and lower albian age underlie the aquifer weinberger et al 1994 abusaada 2011 the aquifer is subdivided into two principal aquifers by the low permeable marly layers of the moza and bet meir formation i e jointly referred to as the yatta formation resulting from open marine depositional conditions due to transgression events during the middle cretaceous braun and hirsch 1994 however due to a local lateral change in facies the two sub aquifers may intermittently be hydraulically connected allowing local equilibration of pressure heads weiss and gvirtzman 2007 the carbonate rocks of the wma are exposed at the surface in anticlinal structures in the judaean samarian and carmel mountains recharge occurs in the exposed areas see fig 1 and 3 the judean group formations dip from the anticlinal axis towards the mediterranean steinberg et al 2008 and control the overall groundwater flow direction the present general flow direction is oriented from the eastern mountain range to the western coastal plain turning north where groundwater discharges at the taninim spring see fig 1 under undisturbed conditions prior to large rate abstraction by pumping the aquifer historically discharged at two springs i e the taninim 95 106m3a 1 and yarkon spring 224 106m3a 1 see tbl 1 however the yarkon spring dried up in the 1960s because of substantial groundwater abstraction starting in the early 1950s the wma is a highly karstified and fractured carbonate aquifer with a complex geological and palaeo hydrogeological development banusch et al 2022 laskow et al 2011 a starting regional uplift of the judaean mountains and the subsequent regression of the tethys sea during the oligocene led to continuous erosion and formation of deep canyons along the shore picard 1943 due to the convergence of africa and eurasia the strait of gibraltar closed and isolated the mediterranean sea in the late miocene i e the messinian salinity crisis flecker and ellam 1999 krijgsman et al 1999 as a result the mediterranean sea level lowered dramatically substantial erosion of the carbonate rocks occurred due to groundwater drainage under the lowered base levels currently conduits occur at all depths resulting from the palaeo hydrogeological regime laskow et al 2011 moreover conduits are located favorably in the vicinity of paleo canyons because of enhanced dissolution increasing the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and groundwater flow rates banusch et al 2022 the methodology is based on a serial arrangement of two models 1 a soil epikarst water balance model see fig 4 a and 2 a variably saturated dual permeability subsurface flow model see fig 4b the soil epikarst water balance model provides daily net infiltration at the soil level as a boundary condition to the vadose phreatic groundwater flow model for the latter we apply hydrogeosphere hgs as a variably saturated dual permeability flow simulator finally we calibrate the employed models inversely to match spring discharge and groundwater level time series 2 1 soil and epikarst water balance model in order to provide daily net infiltration evaluated at the soil level as an input to the subsurface model we implemented a semi distributed dual domain soil epikarst water balance model based on schmidt et al 2014 on a sub basin level for the wma the recharge area of the wma has an overall size of 1812km2 and the soil water balance model is evaluated and parameterized individually for 74 topographical sub basins within the recharge area the median size of a sub basin is 20km2 with a maximum size of 97 7km2 and a minimum size of 1 3km2 schmidt et al 2014 initially developed the water balance model for the catchment of the auja spring located in the adjacent ema the ema shares a common geological unit and recharge area divided by the divergent tilt of the geological units and topography the proposed soil and epikarst water balance model applies to the wma since its soil characteristics and recharge dynamics are comparable the model computes daily net infiltration twice once for the soil cover and once for the exposed epikarst see appendix a and the overall net infiltration re s yields the weighted sum of both we compute potential evapotranspiration following the penman monteith approach allen et al 1998 which together with precipitation serves as an input to the water balance calculation 2 2 subsurface flow model we apply hgs as a dual permeability flow simulator for transient variably saturated water flows in the following we briefly summarize the mathematical concept of the applied features of hgs aquanty inc 2015 provides a detailed description of the mathematical concept and additional features hgs is a highly versatile openmp parallelized flow simulator that allows multiple discretization methods i e a galerkin finite element a control volume finite element and a mimetic finite difference approximation method this study applies the mimetic finite difference approximation scheme since it exhibits considerably enhanced numerical convergence particularly for richards equation this approach allows the definition of the model domain via unstructured finite element grids and subsequently operates with a finite difference discretization by adjusting the connectivity of each node hgs removes all diagonal connections of the finite element 27 point lattice i e complete nearest neighbor connectivity to a 7 point lattice corresponding to a finite difference approximation scheme however more details on the implemented mimetic finite difference scheme are available from panday et al 1993 and therrien and sudicky 1996 the mimetic finite difference approximation significantly reduces computation times at the same time it maintains the advantage of representing complex geology and topography i e local refinement of the mesh e g zones of high hydraulic or topographic gradients in the vicinity of pumping wells and valley structures hgs computes flow via two separate overlapping continua using a modified form of the richards equation richardson 1922 richards 1931 with bulk effective hydraulic flow properties which yields for the matrix and conduit continuum celia et al 1990 1 k r k ψ z γ cm q bc w t θ s s w where k is the hydraulic conductivity tensor kr is the relative permeability ψ is the pressure head z is the elevation head qbc is the volumetric flow rate per unit volume of all applied boundary conditions θs is the water content at full saturation sw is the water saturation i e s w θ θ s and w is the volumetric fraction of the respective continuum γ cm is an inter continuum exchange flux given as a volumetric flux per unit volume the richards equation is applied here in a mass conservative mixed scheme avoiding the specific moisture capacity term of ψ based implementations and therefore improving the robustness of the numerical approximation celia et al 1990 the initial state of the system is defined upon the primary variable the pressure head ψ a water retention curve is applied for both continua to determine the saturation s w ψ and the relative conductivity k r s w in terms of the pressure head ψ which is typically described by an empirically parameterized constitutive relation i e brooks and corey 1964 or mualem 1976 and van genuchten 1980 in this work we utilize the anhysteretic mualem van genuchten vg model to predict the variably saturated hydraulic conductivity where the saturation is given by van genuchten 1980 2 s w s wr 1 s wr 1 α ψ β ν if ψ 0 1 if ψ 0 here ν ν 1 1 β β and α are fitted empirical parameters to match laboratory or field measurements of the water retention curve α is related to the inverse of the air entry pressure the relative conductivity controls the retention of flow in eq 1 and is given by 3 k r s e l p 1 1 s e ν 1 ν 2 where the effective saturation s e is defined as s e s w s wr 1 s wr the pore connectivity l p is an empirical parameter typically presumed to be 0 5 mualem 1976 a minimum relative conductivity k rmin may be defined to set a lower limit for the result of the saturation permeability relation see eq 3 to allow for preferential flow through the second continuum even under dry conditions the constitutive relation may be defined in hgs via the parameters of the applied material model or via pre computed tabular data the latter results in faster computation as the values between data points are approximated linearly and not analytically computed here we choose to represent the constitutive relation by tabulated data with 50 data points to ensure accurate representation the storage term of eq 1 is defined in terms of specific storage s s and water

coefficient α cm controls the responsiveness of the pressure heads to achieve equilibrium between the subsurface continua for the assessment of the predictive performance of the applied numerical model we use the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the normalized nash sutcliffe efficiency nnse the root mean square error rmse and the kling gupta efficiency kge coefficient 2 3 model construction the numerical model is discretized by a 2 dimensional planar unstructured delaunay mesh delaunay triangulation and refinement e g shewchuk 2002 in the horizontal direction with refined spacing in the vicinity of boundary conditions e g springs and wells and areas of a high hydraulic gradient the application of lloyd s algorithm avoids high aspect ratios and improves convergence stability significantly the final planar mesh consists of 12219 nodes corresponding to 23948 triangular elements with a minimum and maximum edge length of respectively 15 6 and 1496 5m and an average edge length of 712m the applied planar mesh exhibits a good mesh quality with η values ranging between 0 49 and 1 00 and an average η value of 0 97 we measure the mesh quality in terms of the ratio η between the area a of a triangle t and the sum of all squared edge lengths li bank and xu 1996 6 η t 4 3 a i 1 3 l i 2 a value of unity corresponds to an optimally shaped triangle with equally sized edges and a value of zero corresponds to a degenerate triangle the vertical geometry is discretized by 80 layers with structured even spacings between the surface and the model base except for the first four grid spacings below the surface here a vertical discretization of 0 25 0 50 1 0 and 2 0m below the surface is assigned to accommodate extensive and rapid pressure changes near the surface during high rate infiltration events the vertical spacing ranges between 0 25 and 32m with an average spacing of 12 8m in a subsequent step we assign hydrogeological zones and hydraulic properties to the generated model elements this approach was preferred in contrast to generating the vertical spacing based on geological layers since it avoids infinitesimal spacings for layers that pinch out we discretize the second continuum only within the lower and upper aquifer elements as conduits in the moza beit meir aquitard formation and the overlaying menuha formation are mostly absent frumkin and gvirtzman 2006 fischhendler and frumkin 2008 in total the model consists of 9 775 105 nodes i e 1 9 106 elements for the matrix continuum and 7 249 105 nodes i e 1 3 106 elements for the second continuum corresponding to a total of 1 7 106 nodes and 3 2 106 tetrahedral elements the model boundaries were defined based on the locations of groundwater divides and bordering impermeable geological units following the definition from abusaada 2011 towards the south the aquifer exhibits a moving boundary adjacent to a saltwater body however due to low hydraulic gradients the southern boundary is less relevant for the flow dynamics of the northern part we implement the yarkon and taninim springs as drain boundaries at the level of the upper aquifer i e not at the surface since artesian discharge because of local discontinuities in the overlaying aquitard can not be resolved discretely in a catchment scale model the reference head is defined as equal to the topographic elevation to ensure that the boundary conditions are only active when the hydraulic head is above the surface the conductance term is set to at a high value cdrain 1 105m3d 1 in order to avoid additional resistance to flow imposed by the boundary condition consequently this boundary condition acts similar to a dirichlet boundary condition but allows for the natural drying up of springs without generating artifacts such as an unrealistic water inflow when groundwater head drops below the ground surface the saltwater intrusion at the northern edge of the aquifer is implemented as a constant volumetric flux of 3 5 106m3a 1 dafny et al 2010 abusaada 2011 groundwater abstraction and injection are implemented as sink terms i e volumetric fluxes at 518 pumping wells and 36 injection wells we compute the pristine net infiltration at the soil level with a separate model see section 2 1 and apply a source term at the surface layer of the vadose phreatic groundwater model via a flux boundary condition since high resolution precipitation data are unavailable before 1990 we compute monthly recharge using a linear regression model after abusaada 2011 between annual precipitation in the recharge effective months the soil water balance model from section 2 1 is employed to model net infiltration from 1990 onwards 3 results 3 1 parameterization and calibration the water balance model is calibrated to match the long term recharge rates from 1990 2020 we assume a given field capacity of 130mm and 10mm respectively for the soil cover and the exposed epikarst only the areal proportions of epikarst soil are adjusted within the 74 sub basins sheffer et al 2011 hartmann et al 2012 and schmidt et al 2014 apply similar values for the wma and ema the long term recharge that serves here as a calibration target is provided by commonly applied site specific linear regressions models of annual precipitation with average annual recharge values in the range of 338 106 to 361 106m3a 1 e g berger 1999 weiss and gvirtzman 2007 abusaada 2011 the calibrated values for the areal proportions in the range of 11 87 follow the distribution of soil cover in the recharge area with increasing direct exposure of bare rocks southwards singer 2007 the water balance model computes an average annual recharge of 313 106m3a 1 this study omitted a detailed calibration of the soil layer storage effect since it likely contributes several orders of magnitude less to the dissipation of the hydraulic signal than the thick vadose zone however the vadose phreatic groundwater model reproduces the spring discharge well in conjunction with the calibrated net infiltration for 1990 2020 i e rmse 0 21 kge 0 76 nse 0 74 given the pronounced storage changes after the unusual wet hydraulic year in 1991 92 the flow equations of the subsurface flow model require seven classes of hydraulic parameters for the matrix continuum and eight classes of hydraulic parameters for the second continuum see table 2 and chapter 2 2 in addition six parameters control the interfacial flow between both continua however we have simplified the parametrization of the interface by defining a single aggregated interface hydraulic conductivity kcm and by setting the first order transfer coefficient αcm to unity we also omit the calibration of the interface vg parameters i e αcm βcm by defining them to be equal to the values of the surrounding matrix continuum we applied 33 and 37 property zones for the lower and upper aquifer respectively with increasing hydraulic conductivities towards the coastal plain and the spring outlets nineteen zones represent the separating moza beit meir formation and eight zones describe the overlaying impermeable formation consequently the model consists of 1309 adjustable parameters however some of the hydraulic parameters e g vg model are homogeneously distributed across the entire model domain reducing the adjustable parameters to 275 given the high complexity i e prone to numerical instabilities and large scale the calibration procedure was limited to manual trial and error calibration in order to reduce complexity we initiated the calibration with a fully saturated single continuum flow model with composite hydraulic properties and calibrated this model inversely based on spring discharge and groundwater hydrographs this allows us to implement boundary conditions and calibrate composite hydraulic parameters computationally efficiently the calibration zones were obtained from dafny et al 2010 and abusaada 2011 during the early modeling phase i e fully saturated the recharge boundary condition compensated for the lack of unsaturated flow for this initial boundary condition we rely on previous work by abusaada 2011 who developed a regression model for annual recharge based on monthly precipitation depths and accounted for the delay of the vadose zone by applying a normalized recharge curve in a subsequent step we introduce variably saturated flow parameterized via the vg material model where suitable parameters of the constitutive relation for karstic media were assumed according to previous studies contractor and jenson 2000 dvory et al 2016 2018 kordilla et al 2012 roulier et al 2006 with the implementation of unsaturated flow processes the top boundary condition was replaced by estimates of net infiltration at the soil level for the period 1950 1990 we still apply the linear regression model from abusaada 2011 but downscaled the annual data to monthly data based on normalized precipitation curves from 1990 onward we apply the semi distributed water balance model to provide daily estimates of net infiltration the switch from a full to a variably saturated flow model required the adjustment of the calibrated specific storage as the vadose zone now induces a transformation of the input signal and delay based on the processes governed by the richards equation i e water retention and non linearity of the hydraulic conductivity also the composite medium saturated hydraulic conductivity was adjusted minimally to compensate for the delayed flow rates through the vadose zone in the last step we implement the second continuum to the model elements of the upper and lower aquifer the first continuum represents flow through the porous i e primary porosity limestone matrix and corresponding hydraulic properties in principle can be obtained from small scale laboratory measurements in contrast the second continuum represents all other flow compartments e g fissures fractures and conduits the hydraulic conductivity of a composite medium i e matrix and conduit fracture jointly assumes higher values on a catchment scale than those observed at the core scale since dominating processes of the system are not resolved e g flow in conduits fractures and fissures see for example sauter 1992 when implementing the second continuum conduit fracture we used a general representative hydraulic conductivity at the core scale of limestone we estimated the hydraulic conductivity of the second continuum based on the calibration results of the single continuum model that represents the composite medium 7 k c m k c w c k m 1 w c where wc is the volumetric fraction of the conduit continuum km and kc is the hydraulic conductivity respectively of the matrix and second continuum and kc m is the composite hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic conductivity of dolomitic limestone typically ranges from 10 11 to 10 3ms 1 sauter 1992 where the higher end member is typical of composite fracture matrix systems here a matrix hydraulic conductivity of 2 31 10 9ms 1 is defined representing the unfractured limestone matrix the volumetric fraction of the second continuum is set to 2 31 10 4 which is on a similar order of magnitude as dvory et al 2016 applied for the same geological unit in a sub catchment of the wma the computed hydraulic conductivities of the model zones range between 4 25 10 6 and 56ms 1 corresponding to spatially distributed karst discontinuities such as conduit networks the porosity of the second continuum is assumed to be unity i e the entire volume is available to flow and the specific storage is set to the compressibility of water 4 3 10 6m 1 the interface between the two continua is parameterized by the first order fluid exchange coefficient αcm which may either be determined by calibration as a lumped fitting parameter kordilla et al 2012 ray et al 1997 or calculated from quasi geometric characteristics aguilar lópez et al 2020 gerke and van genuchten 1993a b we calibrate the subsurface exchange based on a lumped effective interface conductivity k i and set the transfer coefficient to unity implementing a second continuum required minor adjustment of the conduit hydraulic conductivity in this study variably saturated flow in the second continuum is computed by the capillary driven richards equation few studies demonstrated the parameterization of the vg material model for karstic limestones and all studies rely on inversely fitted parameters kordilla et al 2012 provide an extensive sensitivity analysis of the vg parameters in a karstic aquifer however the application of richards equation to the second continuum is subject to process abstraction since flow in conduits and fractures are to a large degree inertia driven i e they may not provide water retention in the limit of larger void spaces and low saturation given the mathematical definition of the vg model because the second continuum is characterized by minimal water retention and hence a weakly developed capillary fringe the vg model theoretically requires highly pronounced water retention curves i e a steep constitutive relation of θ ψ for the second continuum the high matric suction of the matrix results in rapid imbibition into the matrix for partially saturated conditions which is to be expected when describing flow based on capillarity as the pressure head determines the largest saturated pore in other words conduits and fractures may only conduct water when the matrix is fully saturated however in a natural system preferential flow paths along conduits and fractures are active despite the partially saturated surrounding matrix e g kordilla et al 2017 2021 rüdiger et al 2022 shigorina et al 2021 su et al 2003 tokunaga and wan 1997 fabryka martin et al 1996 also steeper functions of θ ψ require a finer spatial discretization to resolve the non linear dependency of the hydraulic variables vogel and ippisch 2008 and therefore found to be unsuitable for models of this complexity given the limitations to the scaling of speed up with the addition of parallel resources see section 3 2 to satisfy the characteristic of non equilibrium infiltration and ease convergence we apply composite vg parameters for both continua and utilize a minimum relative conductivity krmin c for the second continuum this approach allows infiltration through the second continuum even under close to dry conditions the final calibrated model can reproduce the historic spring discharge of the taninim and yarkon springs see fig 5b the drying up in the 1970s the short reactivation 1991 92 of the yarkon spring and the stationary predevelopment and transient hydraulic heads of various observation wells see fig 5a and 6 however in the early phase i e before 1960 the observed discharge at the yarkon spring exhibits a much higher variance than the simulated discharge this results from the annual aggregated pumping rate and recharge values in the early phases until the yarkon spring falls dry that do not reflect the seasonal variability of groundwater abstraction and recharge the discharge measurements during exhibit significant variations typical to karst aquifers however the annually averaged model input before 1990 even for daily time stepping exhibits a somewhat dampened seasonal response not reflecting individual recharge events the groundwater table fluctuations in the catchment are also represented very well by the model with an nse of 0 982 i e rmse 13 1 kge 0 943 representative wells in the high altitude recharge regions e g as samu exhibit a good agreement with the model considering the pronounced fluctuations and high hydraulic gradients in these regions some observation wells such as the well menashe t 1 are difficult to calibrate due to conflicting calibrations targets i e the spring discharge of the taninim and the hydraulic response in the well itself some wells exhibit a considerable discrepancy between measured and calibrated hydraulic heads since the groundwater potential can vary considerably between wells in karst aquifers even if placed adjacent this observation can be explained by local well configurations i e whether a well is completed in the limestone rock matrix or a karst dissolution feature 3 2 strategy to achieve robust convergence the computation of the richards equation is based on applying a non linear constitutive relation of the pressure head ψ and the water content θ ψ to predict partially saturated hydraulic conductivity k ψ however this non linear behavior poses a significant challenge to the robustness of numerical approximations since it is prone to oscillations of the iterative solver this is particularly the case for complex model geometries i e 3d with various layers very thick dry vadose zones semi arid climate with highly episodic precipitation inputs and highly varying topography as is the case for the wma the abovementioned characteristics lead to nearly instantaneous changes in system state variables i e saturation pressure relative hydraulic conductivity and complicate the robust numerical solution improving linearization methods for solving the richards equation is a matter of ongoing research e g list and radu 2016 and still poses significant challenges for certain extreme cases simply increasing computational resources i e adding more parallel resources may not aid in solving these obstacles due to limitations in the scaling of speed up of the applied openmp parallelization scheme hwang et al 2014 furthermore applying richard s equation in a dual permeability catchment scale model due to its contrasting water retention and hydraulic conductivity function poses additional challenges for parameterization computational resources and tackling convergence failures mclaren et al 2000 nevertheless the following strategies greatly assisted in achieving a robust numerical approximation we apply the mimetic finite difference approximation scheme panday et al 1993 therrien and sudicky 1996 because the finite element approximation is prone to oscillations of the newton raphson iteration and therefore inadequate celia et al 1990 confirms this observation for the mixed scheme of the richards equation this in particular holds for initially dry conditions with sharp infiltration fronts further the convergence robustness and computational efficiency of large scale models applying richards equation depend strongly on an adequate spatial discretization see section 2 3 adaptive or variable vertical spatial discretization is essential to avoid numerical instabilities due to rapidly changing state variables and parameters farthing and ogden 2017 in other words the infiltration of water results in a rapid change in hydraulic conductivity from infinitesimal values to the maximum value under full saturation because the constitutive relationships are twice non linear in particular several hundred meter thick vadose zones pose a significant challenge due to the degeneracy of parameters i e infinitesimal hydraulic conductivity here we iteratively increased model complexity i e from a fully saturated single continuum to a variably saturated dual permeability model and at each iteration the output of the previous simulation served as starting condition to achieve a steady state solution of the hydraulic heads in the year 1950 we run the model transiently with stationary boundary conditions for several thousand years i e 1 107 days once the simulation reaches a stationary state the adaptive time stepping scheme of hgs increases time steps rapidly and quickly completes the simulation thus the model calculation represents the steady state when groundwater levels and saturation have reached constant values in addition the utilization of adaptive time steps that increase or decrease according to the change in the hydraulic potential and saturation enables a more efficient calculation of the model also we iteratively implemented variably saturated flow by modifying the water retention and hydraulic conductivity function incrementally from linear to its intended non linear relation we ran the simulations on a high performance computing platform in a parallelized environment to deal with the high computational demands of the complex numerical model comprised of 1 7 106 nodes the simulations are run by domain decomposition parallel hwang et al 2014 on twelve cpu cores access to a high performance computing platform allows for running a nearly infinite number of simulations simultaneously only limited by the available computational resources however the scaling of speed up of an individual simulation is limited by specific tasks that can not be solved parallelized and overheads i e waiting time caused by workload imbalance we observed a maximum speed up of 2 3 for the given model setup and hardware a simulation period of ten years still corresponds to about two days of computing time 3 3 parameter study and sensitivity analysis extensive parameter sensitivity analysis for numerical models of this scale is highly challenging due to many applied parameters i e 275 adjustable parameters long computation times and convergence failure tendency to reduce complexity we assess the sensitivity of individual parameters and neglect inter parameter dependencies see fig 8 and 9 it is justified because not well defined parameters were initially obtained via a lumped parameter calibration and subsequently separated based on obtainable parameters at the core scale i e matrix conductivity for the sensitivity analysis we simulate the response of the system for the period 1990 2000 since the year 1992 marks the end of an extended multi year recession and an unusually wet year replenishing the aquifer with increased spring discharge an effect lasting until around the year 2000 see fig 5 and also fig 2 for the adjacent ema we expect that variations in hydraulic parameters substantially affect well hydraulics during this period the multipliers of the parameters were chosen based on the ability of the model to converge and based on plausible i e observable parameter ranges while it is straightforward to define plausible parameter ranges for a parameter such as the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix and second continuum it is less easy for the insensitive interface conductivity see fig 8b or parameters of less physical meaning also some parameters did not allow significant variations resulting in convergence failure due to rapid pressure changes in fig 8 increases in conductivity of the matrix as well as the second continuum enhance the release of water from the vadose and phreatic zone accordingly the pressure heads in the downgradient coastal plain increase nevertheless this effect is less pronounced and rapid for the matrix continuum due to the longer travel times in contrast the conductivity of the second continuum exhibits a very early response to changes in conductivity around 1992 due to its high calibrated conductivities the vg α value for the matrix is a sensitive parameter and strongly affects the ability of water to move through the vadose zone and the head dependent inter continuum water exchange an increase in vg α leads to a more pronounced transition from the phreatic to the vadose zone i e it decreases the average unsaturated conductivities in the vadose zone this effect increases travel times through the matrix system and decreases the movement of water from the matrix to the second continuum and hence decreases the hydraulic heads in the downstream wells and spring discharge the minimum relative conductivity krmin c of the second continuum is the most influencing parameter controlling preferential infiltration see fig 8 as it truncates the saturation permeability curve and allows for routing through the second continuum under dry conditions in contrast the minimum relative conductivity krmin m of the matrix continuum is insensitive the vg model controls vadose flow dynamics and thus the capillary fringe i e storage in the vadose zone a decreasing α value corresponds to a more significant capillary fringe height minor changes in the calibrated value result in rapid changes of pressure heads and are prone to convergence failure in the phreatic zone the storage term is mainly controlled by the saturated volumetric water content i e effective porosity in the unconfined part of the aquifer and by the specific storage in the confined part due to minimal water retention we assume storage in the second continuum to be negligible and do not include this parameter in the sensitivity analysis however the model exhibits a nearly equal effect on the flow routing through the second continuum under either an increased volumetric fraction or hydraulic conductivity of the second continuum leading to a pronounced decrease in gradient and groundwater head it should be noted that the presented sensitivity results of the observation well kiryat gat exhibit effects of a model equilibration because the initial conditions i e the quasi steady state model stem from the calibrated model for example it triggers in the case of increased hydraulic conductivity of the second continuum strong dewatering of the upgradient mountainous regions and only at later times the expected behavior of decreasing heads and gradients are established hence the sensitivity represents the overall model response over the period 1990 2000 we chose to show the nnse for an individual well calibrated observation well to demonstrate the deviation from the final model parametrization to ascertain that the deviation from the calibration is not averaged out between the wells in addition the properties are adjusted for all property zones simultaneously and deviations occur in all wells 3 4 modeling of phreatic and vadose storage dynamics finally we utilize the presented numerical model to assess the dissipation of the infiltration signal and quantify the relevance of the vadose zone for storage dynamics see fig 7 the precipitation signal and consequently the recharge at the soil level observe pronounced impulses fig 10 illustrates the hydraulic response to an exceptionally intensive wet winter season in 1991 92 with an average annual precipitation depth of 1169mm compared to the long term average precipitation depth of 570mm in the recharge area the thick vadose zone substantially dissipates the distinctive input signal such that recharge at the groundwater table occurs dispersed throughout the entire year see fig 10a b with an average minimum recharge flux of 7 4m3s 1 during dry summers under the present average climatic conditions the simulations indicate that the signal reaches the groundwater table on average after circa 55 days via preferential pathways within the vadose zone however the hydraulic signal at the control plane groundwater table exhibits a long term recession for several months to years the dissipation of the hydraulic signal depends on the intensity of the individual precipitation input see fig 11 a and the antecedent saturation conditions of the vadose zone in fig 11 we measure signal intensity and dissipation of the input signal by the standard deviation σ we determine a standard deviation value per hydrological year based on a resampled daily time series of a representative column in the recharge area of the judean mountains i e near the bar giora site in the district jerusalem this column was selected since this region with an average annual precipitation input of 610mm largely contributes to the overall recharge i e it is relevant to the overall recharge dynamics and at the same time exhibits a fairly thick vadose zone of about 335m we measure the annual signal standard deviation at all 66 unsaturated nodes of the vertical column the signal intensity of the recharge flux at the control plane groundwater table is largely controlled by the intensity of the precipitation input see fig 11a however the thick vadose zone substantially contributes to the dissipation of input signal depending on the system state see fig 11b leading to high time varying dynamics within the vadose zone these results highlight the need for process based modeling approaches since linear transfer functions are limited to time invariant and linear responses as illustrated in fig 7 and 10c the vadose zone presently comprises circa 45 of the dynamic storage volume while under predevelopment conditions i e before the 1950s when large scale groundwater abstraction started the vadose zone storage comprised circa 38 of the dynamic storage the increase in stored vadose water results from the substantial decline in groundwater levels since the 1950s and the consequent increase of the vadose zone depth dynamic storage refers to the stored water above the natural outlet taninim at 4 masl i e the water available to spring discharge the dynamic storage is relevant for aquifer management since this water eventually discharges at its natural outlet and represents the available storage for groundwater abstraction fig 10c illustrates the storage dynamics after the exceptionally wet rainy season with the vadose storage rapidly increasing and a long term recession over roughly two years despite the absolute vadose storage decreasing very quickly to levels before the wet year this is a secondary effect of increasing water tables i e mainly fed by pathways of fast infiltration and a consequent decrease in the volume of the vadose zone the results demonstrate the importance of accounting for vadose flow processes for managing semi arid karst aquifers with thick vadose zones shifted water budgets because of climate change and increased anthropogenic consumption may further accentuate the relevance of the vadose zone for short term storage and the dissipation of the hydraulic signal 4 discussion and conclusion in principle all numerical models representing natural processes are subject to a trade off between parametric ambiguity and structural uncertainty parametric ambiguity arises when multiple sets of parametrizations satisfy the calibration target equally well when more physical processes are incorporated into a numerical model the number of unknown parameters increases making it more challenging to obtain parameters via field measurements and define them unambiguously in contrast lumping physical processes or geological structures risks having oversimplified model structures that do not account for relevant physical processes or local heterogeneity in carbonate aquifers structural uncertainty may also be caused by insufficient consideration of the spatial and temporal variation of natural processes such as rainfall variability sapriza azuri et al 2015 the problem to be solved determines the appropriate level of model complexity for karst aquifers with very thick vadose zones and semi arid climates considering the duality of flow and vadose flow is imperative when assessing the effects of climate change or dealing with temporally resolved issues this study partly alleviates the problem of parametric ambiguity by calibrating a lumped hydraulic conductivity and obtaining the properties of the second continuum by measurable hydraulic properties at the core scale see section 3 1 however nearly all numerical models incorporate a simplified representation of physical processes i e process abstraction depending on the spatio temporal scale of the individual problem process abstraction is applied at a subordinate scale that may have considerable effects on the problem scale the required degree of process consideration depends on the impact on the problem scale it is clear that also the proposed model exhibits a simplified process representation that shall be described in the following unsaturated flow in fractured and karstified media occurs on various length and temporal scales complicating an appropriate mathematical representation of the physical processes a complex interplay of capillary gravitational and viscous forces shape unsaturated flow dragila and weisbrod 2004 kordilla et al 2017 2021 lehmann et al 2012 or 2008 shigorina et al 2021 that may not be discretely resolved unsaturated flow in fractured cavernous media is particularly challenging as highly dynamic processes govern flow such as turbulent flow regimes i e inertia driven infiltration e g droplet rivulet and film flow this effect is negligible for laminar flows in porous media because reynolds numbers are typically low however for conduits and fractures turbulent flow regimes are the dominant regime of fluid motion however bulk effective approaches such as the richards equation with vg parameterization are subject to process abstraction by describing laminar flow based on capillarity and assuming instant hydrostatic equilibration although this study assumes that the richards equation is valid for the second continuum which is a model built in necessary simplification of the occurring processes the proposed model considers physical processes with unprecedented detail volume averaged dual permeability approaches provide a sweet spot for the required computational resources and data demand for catchment scale problems the application of discrete fracture conduit numerical models is impractical presently on large scale catchments such as the wma as it requires the discrete definition of conduits and fractures the proposed model circumvents the inaccurate process representation of the second continuum by applying a higher minimum relative conductivity that truncates the saturation permeability curve by setting a lower permeability threshold this represents the effect of the lower capillarity as the pore space is nearly ubiquitous in the second continuum water retention in the ample void space of the second continuum is caused only by capillary barriers imposed through fracture intersections dragila and weisbrod 2004 wood et al 2005 and surface roughness tokunaga and wan 1997 tokunaga et al 2000 under inertia driven conditions the vg model cannot accurately model the occurring processes of advancing wetting fronts however it is valid to approximate these dynamics at the lower saturation limit i e dry conditions with a minimum hydraulic conductivity applying composite vg parameters and a minimum relative conductivity is a heuristic approximation of the occurring physical processes it should be noted that kordilla et al 2012 applied a very similar approach to model groundwater flow in a karst aquifer in contrast to this study a simpler model geometry i e 2d temperate climate with moderate variability of precipitation inputs i e moderate change in state variables and lower vadose zone thickness constitute the main differences the vg material model as applied by kordilla et al 2012 leads to the inability of preferential infiltration through the second continuum due to high negative pressures of the matrix continuum under dry conditions kordilla et al 2012 circumvented this shortcoming by directly adding a predefined fraction of the net infiltration to the groundwater table in contrast this study applies a composite vg material model for both continua in addition we truncate the vg material model of the second continuum using a minimum relative conductivity to allow for preferential infiltration through the second continuum under dry conditions consequently the applied method still describes the flow in terms of capillary and gravitational forces however we approximate inertia driven infiltration heuristically with the minimum relative conductivity which is a necessary abstraction of the occurring processes given the scale of investigation and unknown dimensions of conduits and fractures also other bulk effective and discrete approaches have been developed recently to deal with fractured porous systems two dimensional analytical and numerical solutions such as those provided by moutsopoulos 2021 are suitable to simulate unconfined dual permeability systems however they cannot capture all relevant processes due to the three dimensional setting and heterogeneous distribution of hydrogeological and hydrological properties within the wma discrete modeling approaches such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph simulations kordilla et al 2017 shigorina et al 2021 are a promising approach to improve the physical representation of inertia driven infiltration processes shigorina et al 2021 combines sph for inertia driven flow through fractures with a bulk effective approach based on richards equation for the unsaturated flow through the matrix however those approaches demand high computation power and are currently limited to the scale of individual fractures or a series of a few fractures in addition other discrete approaches such as discrete fracture network models hyman et al 2015 can often not be implemented on a catchment scale due to the missing information about their location geometry and extent of individual conduits or fractures here bulk effective approaches such as dual permeability models reconcile low data requirements with accurate physical representation furthermore this study applies a dual medium water balance model to estimate the partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and infiltration this approach has some advantages compared to the previously commonly applied linear regression models e g berger 1999 weiss and gvirtzman 2007 abusaada 2011 such as that it heuristically accounts for the duality of infiltration and considers the temporal variability of precipitation however the model accounts for the occurring processes in a lumped physical manner and some processes are simplified applying the globally implicit integrated surface subsurface approach within hgs would further improve the predictive capabilities since it accounts for depth integrated surface flow and the natural partitioning of precipitation into runoff evapotranspiration and infiltration however currently employed solvers and parallelization schemes of hgs due to computational limitations i e maximum speed up of 2 3 by addition of parallel resources see section 2 3 currently do not allow implementing surface processes on top of an already highly complex subsurface flow model thus given the current parallelization scheme numerical implementations and available computational resources we believe in having reached the present day maximum conceivable process representation for a catchment of this scale and vadose zone thickness preexisting catchment scale models of the wma e g bachmat 1995 bachmat and wolman 2000 dafny et al 2010 guttman and zukerman 1995 abusaada 2011 neglect the effect of a several hundred meter thick vadose zone on infiltration dynamics and apply parameters with lumped physical meaning e g indirect representation of vadose zone flow and the separating aquitard via highly anisotropic hydraulic conductivities also they apply simple linear correlations of precipitation and recharge neglecting the spatial and temporal variation of recharge and the storage effect of the vadose zone therefore these models are subject to higher structural uncertainty e g caused by the non physical representation of the infiltration process than the proposed model and are more likely prone to parameter degeneration i e non physical values furthermore as in many mediterranean karst aquifers the unsaturated storage capacity may vary significantly with time and space for aquifers with vadose zones of several hundred meters therefore it is necessary to consider the superposition of rapid recharge via fractures and dissolution features e g dolines shafts and long term diffuse infiltration via the matrix domain particularly in the light of the imminent changing precipitation patterns due to climate change effects investigating the effect of changing rainfall patterns because of shifting climates requires a process based approach that accounts for as many relevant physical processes as possible brouyére et al 2004 cuthbert and tindimugaya 2010 moeck et al 2018 further the dual permeability model provides more realistic estimates of the global hydraulic parameters due to the lower structural uncertainty at the expense of computational time in this study we have demonstrated that variably saturated flow in a thick vadose zone has a considerable impact on the dissipation of the hydraulic signal on the catchment scale the presented model expands the predictive options compared to previously employed approaches by accounting for fully distributed i e time and space dependent vadose storage dynamics with the ability to simulate rapid infiltration the change in storage in the vadose and the phreatic zone and the characteristics of the karst system dynamics the constructed flow model has considerable advantages compared to currently available models allowing to predict spatio temporally distributed recharge and infiltration in addition the non linear response of groundwater recharge to transient climatic inputs requires a daily resolution for the analysis lastly the flow model provides insight into the infiltration dynamics at the catchment scale i e mean residence times in the vadose zone characterized by a potential dependent exchange between slow diffuse and fast flow systems hence it predicts the ability to control the long term release of water consequently the model can predict groundwater flow and infiltration dynamics under changing climates with extremes that expand beyond previously experienced conditions for example climate change simulations project that average long term precipitation will decrease yet the intensity and frequency of short duration extreme rainfall events will increase bucchignani et al 2018 hochman et al 2018 adinolfi et al 2020 together with increased potential evapotranspiration it will affect the water budget of mediterranean karst aquifers accordingly the proposed model may predict available water resources under climate change and support decision makers in planning the required scaling of more costly alternative water sources such as desalinated water and treated greywater in addition the model can be used to assess the potential for managed aquifer recharge applications i e infiltration ponds dry wells to mitigate the effects of drought years the proposed model may also assist in developing more elaborate transfer functions for vadose storage dynamics since it provides fully distributed information about the storage in the vadose zone thus it may aid in demonstrating weaknesses of process abstraction and improving less complex numerical

8535,available methods to quantify the recharge of karst aquifers usually rely on spatially and temporally aggregated precipitation measurements and simplified recharge models employing transfer functions to account for the delay in infiltration and the distribution in time and space they generally neglect the non linear nature of infiltration dynamics through the vadose zone characterized by dual flow behavior with slow diffuse and rapid focused recharge components here we present a methodology that accounts for the physics of flow by employing a variably saturated dual permeability flow model to simulate diffuse and preferential infiltration in a large scale carbonate aquifer the western mountain aquifer wma in israel and the west bank was selected as a suitable groundwater basin because of the large thickness of the vadose zone extending over several hundred meters the availability of long term data as well as the catchment size stretching across a catchment area of circa 9000km2 together these characteristics allow the identification and quantification of the spatio temporal distribution of the infiltration recharge component assessed at the level of the groundwater table the presented methodology allows for improved water resources planning and generalization of the results i e the robustness of large scale model results with respect to local hydraulic parameter variations and data uncertainty semi arid climate regions with a highly pronounced seasonality of precipitation and intense short duration rainfalls such as the mediterranean region represent a prime study location because of the clear and pronounced recharge input signals that are not superimposed by summer rainstorms we simulate the complex dynamics of the dual domain infiltration and partitioning of the precipitation input signal by employing hydrogeosphere hgs for transient variably saturated water flow flow in the limestone rock matrix and high porosity system i e conduits and fractures is modeled by overlapping individual continua based on the bulk effective richards equation with van genuchten vg parameters keywords variably saturated dual permeability flow modeling

made available on request 1 introduction highly heterogeneous flow dynamics characterize karst aquifers in all compartments i e the land surface the vadose and the phreatic zone the heterogeneous distribution of hydraulic properties e g hydraulic conductivity storage within the compartments affects the local and global routing dynamics and hence the magnitude and dissipation of the hydraulic signal between the source precipitation and recharge and spring outlet jeannin and sauter 1998 smart and hobbs 1986 in particular under semi arid climates with pronounced precipitation seasonality i e dry summer and humid winter a thick vadose zone may provide substantial storage to infiltrating water geyer et al 2008 liu et al 2021 schmidt et al 2014 and storage may vary significantly in time and space however the role of the vadose zone is often neglected or only accounted for by employing simple linear transfer functions in catchment scale numerical simulations furthermore a complex interplay between non linear processes with superimposing effects shapes storage in the vadose zone i e the initial state of saturation controls matric suction and storage capacity requiring process based approaches to account for the distributed infiltration through the vadose zone this study demonstrates a complex process based method a variably saturated dual permeability flow model to assess infiltration dynamics and storage in the vadose zone for the western mountain aquifer wma in israel and the west bank the reasoning for selecting this aquifer is that it provides 1 a highly complex karst environment including multi domain heterogeneities in the phreatic and vadose zone 2 a large catchment size with effects of distributive hydrological input and 3 at the same time the integrated hydraulic response at the taninim spring which reflects the entire catchment dynamics in addition semi arid climates exhibit a pronounced seasonality of precipitation and intense short duration rainfalls and therefore can provide clear and pronounced recharge input signals not superimposed by summer rainstorms the unambiguous signal allows for analyzing the contribution of the vadose zone to the delayed dissipation of the hydraulic discharge response to rainstorm events the large catchment size of the wma with 9000km2 ascertains that small scale heterogeneity in hydraulic properties and spatial variability in the distribution of precipitation are averaged out in the integrated response at the spring i e the robustness of large scale model results concerning local hydraulic parameter variations and data uncertainty also the wma is highly relevant to the water supply of israel and the west bank a process based approach improves model validity in long term predictive simulations furthermore it allows for the extraction of information about the time variant moisture distribution within the thick vadose zone hence providing a tool to improve groundwater management strategies for highly stressed aquifer systems for instance fig 2 shows the effect of very wet years e g 1973 74 1991 92 on the long term recession of spring discharge at the auja spring west bank and groundwater hydrographs in the recharge area despite the auja spring being located outside the wma in the jordan valley and belonging to the adjacent eastern mountain aquifer ema the hydraulic response of the auja spring can be considered representative of the wma since the wma and ema share a common recharge area and similar geological units however the signal in the ema is not perturbed by the effects of intensive groundwater abstraction high discharge and groundwater tables were recorded for several years even though recharge was considerably less this observation implies groundwater recharge is stored in either the vadose or the phreatic zone therefore the most appropriate method to investigate the coupled process of infiltration recharge and groundwater flow is the discrete simulation of the hydraulically coupled phreatic and vadose zone considering their respective duality in flow behavior the superposition of rapid recharge via fractures and dissolution features i e dolines shafts and long term diffuse infiltration via the limestone rock matrix domain must be accounted for when addressing the storage dynamics in the following we briefly discuss the existing groundwater flow and recharge models of the wma and describe the applications and merits of the presented model presently existing flow models for the wma calculate fully saturated flow and parameterize the model by employing a single bulk effective continuum i e a lumped matrix fracture conduit continuum e g berger 1999 dafny et al 2010 abusaada 2011 however a saturated single continuum flow model can not account for the storage effect of a several hundred meter thick vadose zone and preferential infiltration pathways moreover a dual permeability model can better reproduce the temporal dynamics of event based spring discharge and local groundwater table responses characterized by a rapid rise after rainfall and gradual and extended recessions for instance abusaada and sauter 2017 represent the vertical aquifer layer structure spatially lumped by applying an accentuated hydraulic anisotropy where the low vertical hydraulic conductivity reflects aquitards and the vadose zone the appropriate choice of process consideration depends on the study objective prevailing flow processes and site specific characteristics this study aims to provide a tool to assess distributed vadose and phreatic storage dynamics on a regional scale and therefore requires the consideration of vadose flow processes vadose flow processes gain further importance when the numerical model is applied to assess the effects of climate change and unsustainable groundwater abstraction likely scaling up the temporal delay because of a thicker vadose zone in addition recharge to the wma is quantified in most previous studies by linear regression models between annual precipitation or the precipitation in the recharge effective winter months and annual recharge berger 1999 weiss and gvirtzman 2007 abusaada 2011 neglecting the intra annual variability of rainfall for instance abusaada 2011 computed annual recharge i e defined as input at the level of the groundwater table based on a linear regression between precipitation during the recharge effective winter months and subsequently accounted for the transfer through the vadose zone by an empirically obtained normalized recharge curve on a monthly time step the recharge curve is the median seasonal water table fluctuation over multiple years dafny et al 2010 define the recharge flux at a fixed fraction of the annual precipitation while the above methods have their merits e g simplicity parsimony of applied parameters and lesser demand on data they do not account for the spatio temporal distribution of precipitation recharge and infiltration therefore they can not be employed to predict future recharge and storage dynamics for different climatic conditions sheffer et al 2010 provide an approach to assess distributed recharge to the wma based on a daily soil water balance model for three soil types i e terra rossa rendzina and desert coupled with a monthly groundwater flow model fully saturated however this approach neglects the storage and delaying effect of the vadose zones and the dual domain flow dynamics furthermore the recharge area of the wma is characterized by a large proportion of exposed bare carbonate rock providing potential pathways for rapid infiltration into the consolidated formations dvory et al 2016 and dvory et al 2018 have considered the vadose flow processes at the local scale by employing a 2 dimensional dual permeability infiltration model for a smaller sub catchment of the wma i e the soreq catchment this study accounts for infiltration and vadose storage dynamics at the catchment scale by employing a variably saturated dual permeability flow model we discretize the rock matrix and secondary porosity i e conduits and fractures as separate overlapping continua flow is computed via the bulk effective richards equation with van genuchten vg parameters to model flow in karstified limestone rock material with rapid flow through conduits and slow flow through the rock matrix in the vadose and the phreatic zone the individual continua transfer water based on a first order exchange term across a coupling interface with a coupling length and a conductance as controlling parameters the applied model accounts for short term recharge essential in climate zones characterized by pronounced seasonality i e semi arid climates furthermore preferential flow paths enhance accentuated recharge through the vadose zone climate simulations for israel and west bank suggest an increased frequency of extreme rain events and an overall decrease in annual precipitation because of climate change bucchignani et al 2018 hochman et al 2018 adinolfi et al 2020 further emphasizing dynamic infiltration characteristics their combined effects on vadose zone storage and the necessity to account for appropriate modeling techniques 2 methods and model construction in order to investigate the above characteristics of the effect of thick unsaturated zones on the spatio temporal variation of recharge observed at the level of the groundwater table with the endeavor of being able to obtain generalizable results a study area has to be selected that is large enough to minimize effects of small scale catchment specifics this catchment was found in the eastern mediterranean i e the western mountain aquifer wma the wma extends over an area of circa 9000km2 in israel and the west bank and is bordered by the carmel mountains in the north the sinai desert in the south the mediterranean coastline in the west and the samarian and judaean mountains in the east see fig 1 the aquifer comprises late albian turonian judea group lithofacies representing a shallow water carbonate platform sequence of the tethys sass and bein 1982

2010 low permeable layers of marl clay and shale of the aptian and lower albian age underlie the aquifer weinberger et al 1994 abusaada 2011 the aquifer is subdivided into two principal aquifers by the low permeable marly layers of the moza and bet meir formation i e jointly referred to as the yatta formation resulting from open marine depositional conditions due to transgression events during the middle cretaceous braun and hirsch 1994 however due to a local lateral change in facies the two sub aquifers may intermittently be hydraulically connected allowing local equilibration of pressure heads weiss and gvirtzman 2007 the carbonate rocks of the wma are exposed at the surface in anticlinal structures in the judaean samarian and carmel mountains recharge occurs in the exposed areas see fig 1 and 3 the judean group formations dip from the anticlinal axis towards the mediterranean steinberg et al 2008 and control the overall groundwater flow direction the present general flow direction is oriented from the eastern mountain range to the western coastal plain turning north where groundwater discharges at the taninim spring see fig 1 under undisturbed conditions prior to large rate abstraction by pumping the aquifer historically discharged at two springs i e the taninim 95 106m3a 1 and yarkon spring 224 106m3a 1 see tbl 1 however the yarkon spring dried up in the 1960s because of substantial groundwater abstraction starting in the early 1950s the wma is a highly karstified and fractured carbonate aquifer with a complex geological and palaeo hydrogeological development banusch et al 2022 laskow et al 2011 a starting regional uplift of the judaean mountains and the subsequent regression of the tethys sea during the oligocene led to continuous erosion and formation of deep canyons along the shore picard 1943 due to the convergence of africa and eurasia the strait of gibraltar closed and isolated the mediterranean sea in the late miocene i e the messinian salinity crisis flecker and ellam 1999 krijgsman et al 1999 as a result the mediterranean sea level lowered dramatically substantial erosion of the carbonate rocks occurred due to groundwater drainage under the lowered base levels currently conduits occur at all depths resulting from the palaeo hydrogeological regime laskow et al 2011 moreover conduits are located favorably in the vicinity of paleo canyons because of enhanced dissolution increasing the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and groundwater flow rates banusch et al 2022 the methodology is based on a serial arrangement of two models 1 a soil epikarst water balance model see fig 4 a and 2 a variably saturated dual permeability subsurface flow model see fig 4b the soil epikarst water balance model provides daily net infiltration at the soil level as a boundary condition to the vadose phreatic groundwater flow model for the latter we apply hydrogeosphere hgs as a variably saturated dual permeability flow simulator finally we calibrate the employed models inversely to match spring discharge and groundwater level time series 2 1 soil and epikarst water balance model in order to provide daily net infiltration evaluated at the soil level as an input to the subsurface model we implemented a semi distributed dual domain soil epikarst water balance model based on schmidt et al 2014 on a sub basin level for the wma the recharge area of the wma has an overall size of 1812km2 and the soil water balance model is evaluated and parameterized individually for 74 topographical sub basins within the recharge area the median size of a sub basin is 20km2 with a maximum size of 97 7km2 and a minimum size of 1 3km2 schmidt et al 2014 initially developed the water balance model for the catchment of the auja spring located in the adjacent ema the ema shares a common geological unit and recharge area divided by the divergent tilt of the geological units and topography the proposed soil and epikarst water balance model applies to the wma since its soil characteristics and recharge dynamics are comparable the model computes daily net infiltration twice once for the soil cover and once for the exposed epikarst see appendix a and the overall net infiltration re s yields the weighted sum of both we compute potential evapotranspiration following the penman monteith approach allen et al 1998 which together with precipitation serves as an input to the water balance calculation 2 2 subsurface flow model we apply hgs as a dual permeability flow simulator for transient variably saturated water flows in the following we briefly summarize the mathematical concept of the applied features of hgs aquanty inc 2015 provides a detailed description of the mathematical concept and additional features hgs is a highly versatile openmp parallelized flow simulator that allows multiple discretization methods i e a galerkin finite element a control volume finite element and a mimetic finite difference approximation method this study applies the mimetic finite difference approximation scheme since it exhibits considerably enhanced numerical convergence particularly for richards equation this approach allows the definition of the model domain via unstructured finite element grids and subsequently operates with a finite difference discretization by adjusting the connectivity of each node hgs removes all diagonal connections of the finite element 27 point lattice i e complete nearest neighbor connectivity to a 7 point lattice corresponding to a finite difference approximation scheme however more details on the implemented mimetic finite difference scheme are available from panday et al 1993 and therrien and sudicky 1996 the mimetic finite difference approximation significantly reduces computation times at the same time it maintains the advantage of representing complex geology and topography i e local refinement of the mesh e g zones of high hydraulic or topographic gradients in the vicinity of pumping wells and valley structures hgs computes flow via two separate overlapping continua using a modified form of the richards equation richardson 1922

the saturation permeability relation see eq 3 to allow for preferential flow through the second continuum even under dry conditions the constitutive relation may be defined in hgs via the parameters of the applied material model or via pre computed tabular data the latter results in faster computation as the values between data points are approximated linearly and not analytically computed here

model we use the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the normalized nash sutcliffe efficiency nnse the root mean square error rmse and the kling gupta efficiency kge coefficient 2 3 model construction the numerical model is discretized by a 2 dimensional planar unstructured delaunay mesh delaunay triangulation and refinement e g shewchuk 2002 in the horizontal direction with refined spacing in the vicinity of boundary conditions e g springs and wells and areas of a high hydraulic gradient the application of lloyd s algorithm avoids high aspect ratios and improves convergence stability significantly the final planar mesh consists of 12219 nodes corresponding to 23948 triangular elements with a minimum and maximum edge length of respectively 15 6 and 1496 5m and an average edge length of 712m the applied planar mesh exhibits a good mesh quality with η values ranging between 0 49 and 1 00 and an average η value of 0 97 we measure the mesh quality in terms of the ratio η between the area a of a triangle t and the sum of all squared edge lengths li bank and xu 1996 6 η t 4 3 a i 1 3 l i 2 a value of unity corresponds to an optimally shaped triangle with equally sized edges and a value of zero corresponds to a degenerate triangle the vertical geometry is discretized by 80 layers with structured even spacings between the surface and the model base except for the first four grid spacings below the surface here a vertical discretization of 0 25 0 50 1 0 and 2 0m below the surface is assigned to accommodate extensive and rapid pressure changes near the surface during high rate infiltration events the vertical spacing ranges between 0 25 and 32m with an average spacing of 12 8m in a subsequent step we assign hydrogeological zones and hydraulic properties to the generated model elements this approach was preferred in contrast to generating the vertical spacing based on geological layers since it avoids infinitesimal spacings for layers that pinch out we discretize the second continuum only within the lower and upper aquifer elements as conduits in the moza beit meir aquitard formation and the overlaying menuha formation are mostly absent frumkin and gvirtzman 2006 fischhendler and frumkin 2008 in total the model consists of 9 775 105 nodes i e 1 9 106 elements for the matrix continuum and 7 249 105 nodes i e 1 3 106 elements for the second continuum corresponding to a total of 1 7 106 nodes and 3 2 106 tetrahedral elements the model boundaries were defined based on the locations of groundwater divides and bordering impermeable geological units following the definition from abusaada 2011 towards the south the aquifer exhibits a moving boundary adjacent to a saltwater body however due to low hydraulic gradients the southern boundary is less relevant for the flow dynamics of the northern part we implement the yarkon and taninim springs as drain boundaries at the level of the upper aquifer i e not at the surface since artesian discharge because of local discontinuities in the overlaying aquitard can not be resolved discretely in a catchment scale model the reference head is defined as equal to the topographic elevation to ensure that the boundary conditions are only active when the hydraulic head is above the surface the conductance term is set to at a high value cdrain 1 105m3d 1 in order to avoid additional resistance to flow imposed by the boundary condition consequently this boundary condition acts similar to a dirichlet boundary condition but allows for the natural drying up of springs without generating artifacts such as an unrealistic water inflow when groundwater head drops below the ground surface the saltwater intrusion at the northern edge of the aquifer is implemented as a constant volumetric flux of 3 5 106m3a 1 dafny et al 2010 abusaada 2011 groundwater abstraction and injection are implemented as sink terms i e volumetric fluxes at 518 pumping wells and 36 injection wells we compute the pristine net infiltration at the soil level with a separate model see section 2 1 and apply a source term at the surface layer of the vadose phreatic groundwater model via a flux boundary condition since high resolution precipitation data are unavailable before 1990 we compute monthly recharge using a linear regression model after abusaada 2011 between annual precipitation in the recharge effective months the soil water balance model from section 2 1 is employed to model net infiltration from 1990 onwards 3 results 3 1 parameterization and calibration the water balance model is calibrated to match the long term recharge rates from 1990 2020 we assume a given field capacity of 130mm and 10mm respectively for the soil cover and the exposed epikarst only the areal proportions of epikarst soil are adjusted within the 74 sub basins sheffer et al 2011 hartmann et al 2012 and schmidt et al 2014 apply similar values for the wma and ema the long term recharge that serves here as a calibration target is provided by commonly applied site specific linear regressions models of annual precipitation with average annual recharge values in the range of 338 106 to 361 106m3a 1 e g berger 1999 weiss and gvirtzman 2007 abusaada 2011 the calibrated values for the areal proportions in the range of 11 87 follow the distribution of soil cover in the recharge area with increasing direct exposure of bare rocks southwards singer 2007 the water balance model computes an average annual recharge of 313 106m3a 1 this study omitted a detailed calibration of the soil layer storage effect since it likely contributes several orders of magnitude less to the dissipation of the hydraulic signal than the thick vadose zone however the vadose phreatic groundwater model reproduces the spring discharge well in conjunction with the calibrated net infiltration for 1990 2020 i e rmse 0 21 kge 0 76 nse 0 74 given the pronounced storage changes after the unusual wet hydraulic year in 1991 92 the flow equations of the subsurface flow model require seven classes of hydraulic parameters for the matrix continuum and eight classes of hydraulic parameters for the second continuum see table 2 and chapter 2 2 in addition six parameters control the interfacial flow between both continua however we have simplified the parametrization of the interface by defining a single aggregated interface hydraulic conductivity kcm and by setting the first order transfer coefficient αcm to unity we also omit the calibration of the interface vg parameters i e αcm βcm by defining them to be equal to the values of the surrounding matrix continuum we applied 33 and 37 property zones for the lower and upper aquifer respectively with increasing hydraulic conductivities towards the coastal plain and the spring outlets nineteen zones represent the separating moza beit meir formation and eight zones describe the overlaying impermeable formation consequently the model consists of 1309 adjustable parameters however some of the hydraulic parameters e g vg model are homogeneously distributed across the entire model domain reducing the adjustable parameters to 275 given the high complexity i e prone to numerical instabilities and large scale the calibration procedure was limited to manual trial and error calibration in order to reduce complexity we initiated the calibration with a fully saturated single continuum flow model with composite hydraulic properties and calibrated this model inversely based on spring discharge and groundwater hydrographs this allows us to implement boundary conditions and calibrate composite hydraulic parameters computationally efficiently the calibration zones were obtained from dafny et al 2010 and abusaada 2011 during the early modeling phase i e fully saturated the recharge boundary condition compensated for the lack of unsaturated flow for this initial boundary condition we rely on previous work by abusaada 2011 who developed a regression model for annual recharge based on monthly precipitation depths and accounted for the delay of the vadose zone by applying a normalized recharge curve in a subsequent step we introduce variably saturated flow parameterized via the vg material model where suitable parameters of the constitutive relation for karstic media were assumed according to previous studies contractor and jenson 2000 dvory et al 2016 2018 kordilla et al 2012 roulier et al 2006 with the implementation of unsaturated flow processes the top boundary condition was replaced by estimates of net infiltration at the soil level for the period 1950 1990 we still apply the linear regression model from abusaada 2011 but downscaled the annual data to monthly data based on normalized precipitation curves from 1990 onward we apply the semi distributed water balance model to provide daily estimates of net infiltration the switch from a full to a variably saturated flow model required the adjustment of the calibrated specific storage as the vadose zone now induces a transformation of the input signal and delay based on the processes governed by the richards equation i e water retention and non linearity of the hydraulic conductivity also the composite medium saturated hydraulic conductivity was adjusted minimally to compensate for the delayed flow rates through the vadose zone in the last step we implement the second continuum to the model elements of the upper and lower aquifer the first continuum represents flow through the porous i e primary porosity limestone matrix and corresponding hydraulic properties in principle can be obtained from small scale laboratory measurements in contrast the second continuum represents all other flow compartments e g fissures fractures and conduits the hydraulic conductivity of a composite medium i e matrix and conduit fracture jointly assumes higher values on a catchment scale than those observed at the core scale since dominating processes of the system are not resolved e g flow in conduits fractures and fissures see for example sauter 1992 when implementing the second continuum conduit fracture we used a general representative hydraulic conductivity at the core scale of limestone we estimated the hydraulic conductivity of the second continuum based on the calibration results of the single continuum model that represents the composite medium 7 k c m k c w c k m 1 w c where wc is the volumetric fraction of the conduit continuum km and kc is the hydraulic conductivity respectively of the matrix and second continuum and kc m is the composite hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic conductivity of dolomitic limestone typically ranges from 10 11 to 10 3ms 1 sauter 1992 where the higher end member is typical of composite fracture matrix systems here a matrix hydraulic conductivity of 2 31 10 9ms 1 is defined representing the unfractured limestone matrix the volumetric fraction of the second continuum is set to 2 31 10 4 which is on a similar order of magnitude as dvory et al 2016 applied for the same geological unit in a sub catchment of the wma the computed hydraulic conductivities of the model zones range between 4 25 10 6 and 56ms 1 corresponding to spatially distributed karst discontinuities such as conduit networks the porosity of the second continuum is assumed to be unity i e the entire volume is available to flow and the specific storage is set to the compressibility of water 4 3 10 6m 1 the interface between the two continua is parameterized by the first order fluid exchange coefficient αcm which may either be determined by calibration as a lumped fitting parameter kordilla et al 2012 ray et al 1997 or calculated from quasi geometric characteristics aguilar lópez et al 2020 gerke and van genuchten 1993a b we calibrate the subsurface exchange based on a lumped effective interface conductivity k i and set the transfer coefficient to unity implementing a second continuum required minor adjustment of the conduit hydraulic conductivity in this study variably saturated flow in the second continuum is computed by the capillary driven richards equation few studies demonstrated the parameterization of the vg material model for karstic limestones and all studies rely on inversely fitted parameters kordilla et al 2012 provide an extensive sensitivity analysis of the vg parameters in a karstic aquifer however the application of richards equation to the second continuum is subject to process abstraction since flow in conduits and fractures are to a large degree inertia driven i e they may not provide water retention in the limit of larger void spaces and low saturation given the mathematical definition of the vg model because the second continuum is characterized by minimal water retention and hence a weakly developed capillary fringe the vg model theoretically requires highly pronounced water retention curves i e a steep constitutive relation of θ ψ for the second continuum the high matric suction of the matrix results in rapid imbibition into the matrix for partially saturated conditions which is to be expected when describing flow based on capillarity as the pressure head determines the largest saturated pore in other words conduits and fractures may only conduct water when the matrix is fully saturated however in a natural system preferential flow paths along conduits and fractures are active despite the partially saturated surrounding matrix e g kordilla et al 2017 2021 rüdiger et al 2022 shigorina et al 2021 su et al 2003 tokunaga and wan 1997 fabryka martin et al 1996 also steeper functions of θ ψ require a finer spatial discretization to resolve the non linear dependency of the hydraulic variables vogel and ippisch 2008 and therefore found to be unsuitable for models of this complexity given the limitations to the scaling of speed up with the addition of parallel resources see section 3 2 to satisfy the characteristic of non equilibrium infiltration and ease convergence we apply composite vg parameters for both continua and utilize a minimum relative conductivity krmin c for the second continuum this approach allows infiltration through the second continuum even under close to dry conditions the final calibrated model can reproduce the historic spring discharge of the taninim and yarkon springs see fig 5b the drying up in the 1970s the short reactivation 1991 92 of the yarkon spring and the stationary predevelopment and transient hydraulic heads of various observation wells see fig 5a and 6 however in the early phase i e before 1960 the observed discharge at the yarkon spring exhibits a much higher variance than the simulated discharge this results from the annual aggregated pumping rate and recharge values in the early phases until the yarkon spring falls dry that do not reflect the seasonal variability of groundwater abstraction and recharge the discharge measurements during exhibit significant variations typical to karst aquifers however the annually averaged model input before 1990 even for daily time stepping exhibits a somewhat dampened seasonal response not reflecting individual recharge events the groundwater table fluctuations in the catchment are also represented very well by the model with an nse of 0 982 i e rmse 13 1 kge 0 943 representative wells in the high altitude recharge regions e g as samu exhibit a good agreement with the model considering the pronounced fluctuations and high hydraulic gradients in these regions some observation wells such as the well menashe t 1 are difficult to calibrate due to conflicting calibrations targets i e the spring discharge of the taninim and the hydraulic response in the well itself some wells exhibit a considerable discrepancy between measured and calibrated hydraulic heads since the groundwater potential can vary considerably between wells in karst aquifers even if placed adjacent this observation can be explained by local well configurations i e whether a well is completed in the limestone rock matrix or a karst dissolution feature 3 2 strategy to achieve robust convergence the computation of the richards equation is based on applying a non linear constitutive relation of the pressure head ψ and the water content θ ψ to predict partially saturated hydraulic conductivity k ψ however this non linear behavior poses a significant challenge to the robustness of numerical approximations since it is prone to oscillations of the iterative solver this is particularly the case for complex model geometries i e 3d with various layers very thick dry vadose zones semi arid climate with highly episodic precipitation inputs and highly varying topography as is the case for the wma the abovementioned characteristics lead to nearly instantaneous changes in system state variables i e saturation pressure relative hydraulic conductivity and complicate the robust numerical solution improving linearization methods for solving the richards equation is a matter of ongoing research e g list and radu 2016 and still poses significant challenges for certain extreme cases simply increasing computational resources i e adding more parallel resources may not aid in solving these obstacles due to limitations in the scaling of speed up of the applied openmp parallelization scheme hwang et al 2014 furthermore applying richard s equation in a dual permeability catchment scale model due to its contrasting water retention and hydraulic conductivity function poses additional challenges for parameterization computational resources and tackling convergence failures mclaren et al 2000 nevertheless the following strategies greatly assisted in achieving a robust numerical approximation we apply the mimetic finite difference approximation scheme panday et al 1993 therrien and sudicky 1996 because the finite element approximation is prone to oscillations of the newton raphson iteration and therefore inadequate celia et al 1990 confirms this observation for the mixed scheme of the richards equation this in particular holds for initially dry conditions with sharp infiltration fronts further the convergence robustness and computational efficiency of large scale models applying richards equation depend strongly on an adequate spatial discretization see section 2 3 adaptive or variable vertical spatial discretization is essential to avoid numerical instabilities due to rapidly changing state variables and parameters farthing and ogden 2017 in other words the infiltration of water results in a rapid change in hydraulic conductivity from infinitesimal values to the maximum value under full saturation because the constitutive relationships are twice non linear in particular several hundred meter thick vadose zones pose a significant challenge due to the degeneracy of parameters i e infinitesimal hydraulic conductivity here we iteratively increased model complexity i e from a fully saturated single continuum to a variably saturated dual permeability model and at each iteration the output of the previous simulation served as starting condition to achieve a steady state solution of the hydraulic heads in the year 1950 we run the model transiently with stationary boundary conditions for several thousand years i e 1 107 days once the simulation reaches a stationary state the adaptive time stepping scheme of hgs increases time steps rapidly and quickly completes the simulation thus the model calculation represents the steady state when groundwater levels and saturation have reached constant values in addition the utilization of adaptive time steps that increase or decrease according to the change in the hydraulic potential and saturation enables a more efficient calculation of the model also we iteratively implemented variably saturated flow by modifying the water retention and hydraulic conductivity function incrementally from linear to its intended non linear relation we ran the simulations on a high performance computing platform in a parallelized environment to deal with the high computational demands of the complex numerical model comprised of 1 7 106 nodes the simulations are run by domain decomposition parallel hwang et al 2014 on twelve cpu cores access to a high performance computing platform allows for running a nearly infinite number of simulations simultaneously only limited by the available computational resources however the scaling of speed up of an individual simulation is limited by specific tasks that can not be solved parallelized and overheads i e waiting time caused by workload imbalance we observed a maximum speed up of 2 3 for the given model setup and hardware a simulation period of ten years still corresponds to about two days of computing time 3 3 parameter study and sensitivity analysis extensive parameter sensitivity analysis for numerical models of this scale is highly challenging due to many applied parameters i e 275 adjustable parameters long computation times and convergence failure tendency to reduce complexity we assess the sensitivity of individual parameters and neglect inter parameter dependencies see fig 8 and 9 it is justified because not well defined parameters were initially obtained via a lumped parameter calibration and subsequently separated based on obtainable parameters at the core scale i e matrix conductivity for the sensitivity analysis we simulate the response of the system for the period 1990 2000 since the year 1992 marks the end of an extended multi year recession and an unusually wet year replenishing the aquifer with increased spring discharge an effect lasting until around the year 2000 see fig 5 and also fig 2 for the adjacent ema we expect that variations in hydraulic parameters substantially affect well hydraulics during this period the multipliers of the parameters were chosen based on the ability of the model to converge and based on plausible i e observable parameter ranges while it is straightforward to define plausible parameter ranges for a parameter such as the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix and second continuum it is less easy for the insensitive interface conductivity see fig 8b or parameters of less physical meaning also some parameters did not allow significant variations resulting in convergence failure due to rapid pressure changes in fig 8 increases in conductivity of the matrix as well as the second continuum enhance the release of water from the vadose and phreatic zone accordingly the pressure heads in the downgradient coastal plain increase nevertheless this effect is less pronounced and rapid for the matrix continuum due to the longer travel times in contrast the conductivity of the second continuum exhibits a very early response to changes in conductivity around 1992 due to its high calibrated conductivities the vg α value for the matrix is a sensitive parameter and strongly affects the ability of water to move through the vadose zone and the head dependent inter continuum water exchange an increase in vg α leads to a more pronounced transition from the phreatic to the vadose zone i e it decreases the average unsaturated conductivities in the vadose zone this effect increases travel times through the matrix system and decreases the movement of water from the matrix to the second continuum and hence decreases the hydraulic heads in the downstream wells and spring discharge the minimum relative conductivity krmin c of the second continuum is the most influencing parameter controlling preferential infiltration see fig 8 as it truncates the saturation permeability curve and allows for routing through the second continuum under dry conditions in contrast the minimum relative conductivity krmin m of the matrix continuum is insensitive the vg model controls vadose flow dynamics and thus the capillary fringe i e storage in the vadose zone a decreasing α value corresponds to a more significant capillary fringe height minor changes in the calibrated value result in rapid changes of pressure heads and are prone to convergence failure in the phreatic zone the storage term is mainly controlled by the saturated volumetric water content i e effective porosity in the unconfined part of the aquifer and by the specific storage in the confined part due to minimal water retention we assume storage in the second continuum to be negligible and do not include this parameter in the sensitivity analysis however the model exhibits a nearly equal effect on the flow routing through the second continuum under either an increased volumetric fraction or hydraulic conductivity of the second continuum leading to a pronounced decrease in gradient and groundwater head it should be noted that the presented sensitivity results of the observation well kiryat gat exhibit effects of a model equilibration because the initial conditions i e the quasi steady state model stem from the calibrated model for example it triggers in the case of increased hydraulic conductivity of the second continuum strong dewatering of the upgradient mountainous regions and only at later times the expected behavior of decreasing heads and gradients are established hence the sensitivity represents the overall model response over the period 1990 2000 we chose to show the nnse for an individual well calibrated observation well to demonstrate the deviation from the final model parametrization to ascertain that the deviation from the calibration is not averaged out between the wells in addition the properties are adjusted for all property zones simultaneously and deviations occur in all wells 3 4 modeling of phreatic and vadose storage dynamics finally we utilize the presented numerical model to assess the dissipation of the infiltration signal and quantify the relevance of the vadose zone for storage dynamics see fig 7 the precipitation signal and consequently the recharge at the soil level observe pronounced impulses fig 10 illustrates the hydraulic response to an exceptionally intensive wet winter season in 1991 92 with an average annual precipitation depth of 1169mm compared to the long term average precipitation depth of 570mm in the recharge area the thick vadose zone substantially dissipates the distinctive input signal such that recharge at the groundwater table occurs dispersed throughout the entire year see fig 10a b with an average minimum recharge flux of 7 4m3s 1 during dry summers under the present average climatic conditions the simulations indicate that the signal reaches the groundwater table on average after circa 55 days via preferential pathways within the vadose zone however the hydraulic signal at the control plane groundwater table exhibits a long term recession for several months to years the dissipation of the hydraulic signal depends on the intensity of the individual precipitation input see fig 11 a and the antecedent saturation conditions of the vadose zone in fig 11 we measure signal intensity and dissipation of the input signal by the standard deviation σ we determine a standard deviation value per hydrological year based on a resampled daily time series of a representative column in the recharge area of the judean mountains i e near the bar giora site in the district jerusalem this column was selected since this region with an average annual precipitation input of 610mm largely contributes to the overall recharge i e it is relevant to the overall recharge dynamics and at the same time exhibits a fairly thick vadose zone of about 335m we measure the annual signal standard deviation at all 66 unsaturated nodes of the vertical column the signal intensity of the recharge flux at the control plane groundwater table is largely controlled by the intensity of the precipitation input see fig 11a however the thick vadose zone substantially contributes to the dissipation of input signal depending on the system state see fig 11b leading to high time varying dynamics within the vadose zone these results highlight the need for process based modeling approaches since linear transfer functions are limited to time invariant and linear responses as illustrated in fig 7 and 10c the vadose zone presently comprises circa 45 of the dynamic storage volume while under predevelopment conditions i e before the 1950s when large scale groundwater abstraction started the vadose zone storage comprised circa 38 of the dynamic storage the increase in stored vadose water results from the substantial decline in groundwater levels since the 1950s and the consequent increase of the vadose zone depth dynamic storage refers to the stored water above the natural outlet taninim at 4 masl i e the water available to spring discharge the dynamic storage is relevant for aquifer management since this water eventually discharges at its natural outlet and represents the available storage for groundwater abstraction fig 10c illustrates the storage dynamics after the exceptionally wet rainy season with the vadose storage rapidly increasing and a long term recession over roughly two years despite the absolute vadose storage decreasing very quickly to levels before the wet year this is a secondary effect of increasing water tables i e mainly fed by pathways of fast infiltration and a consequent decrease in the volume of the vadose zone the results demonstrate the importance of accounting for vadose flow processes for managing semi arid karst aquifers with thick vadose zones shifted water budgets because of climate change and increased anthropogenic consumption may further accentuate the relevance of the vadose zone for short term storage and the dissipation of the hydraulic signal 4 discussion and conclusion in principle all numerical models representing natural processes are subject to a trade off between parametric ambiguity and structural uncertainty parametric ambiguity arises when multiple sets of parametrizations satisfy the calibration target equally well when more physical processes are incorporated into a numerical model the number of unknown parameters increases making it more challenging to obtain parameters via field measurements and define them unambiguously in contrast lumping physical processes or geological structures risks having oversimplified model structures that do not account for relevant physical processes or local heterogeneity in carbonate aquifers structural uncertainty may also be caused by insufficient consideration of the spatial and temporal variation of natural processes such as rainfall variability sapriza azuri et al 2015 the problem to be solved determines the appropriate level of model complexity for karst aquifers with very thick vadose zones and semi arid climates considering the duality of flow and vadose flow is imperative when assessing the effects of climate change or dealing with temporally resolved issues this study partly alleviates the problem of parametric ambiguity by calibrating a lumped hydraulic conductivity and obtaining the properties of the second continuum by measurable hydraulic properties at the core scale see section 3 1 however nearly all numerical models incorporate a simplified representation of physical processes i e process abstraction depending on the spatio temporal scale of the individual problem process abstraction is applied at a subordinate scale that may have considerable effects on the problem scale the required degree of process consideration depends on the impact on the problem scale it is clear that also the proposed model exhibits a simplified process representation that shall be described in the following unsaturated flow in fractured and karstified media occurs on various length and temporal scales complicating an appropriate mathematical representation of the physical processes a complex interplay of capillary gravitational and viscous forces shape unsaturated flow dragila and weisbrod 2004 kordilla et al 2017 2021 lehmann et al 2012 or 2008 shigorina et al 2021 that may not be discretely resolved unsaturated flow in fractured cavernous media is particularly challenging as highly dynamic processes govern flow such as turbulent flow regimes i e inertia driven infiltration e g droplet rivulet and film flow this effect is negligible for laminar flows in porous media because reynolds numbers are typically low however for conduits and fractures turbulent flow regimes are the dominant regime of fluid motion however bulk effective approaches such as the richards equation with vg parameterization are subject to process abstraction by describing laminar flow based on capillarity and assuming instant hydrostatic equilibration although this study assumes that the richards equation is valid for the second continuum which is a model built in necessary simplification of the occurring processes the proposed model considers physical processes with unprecedented detail volume averaged dual permeability approaches provide a sweet spot for the required computational resources and data demand for catchment scale problems the application of discrete fracture conduit numerical models is impractical presently on large scale catchments such as the wma as it requires the discrete definition of conduits and fractures the proposed model circumvents the inaccurate process representation of the second continuum by applying a higher minimum relative conductivity that truncates the saturation permeability curve by setting a lower permeability threshold this represents the effect of the lower capillarity as the pore space is nearly ubiquitous in the second continuum water retention in the ample void space of the second continuum is caused only by capillary barriers imposed through fracture intersections dragila and weisbrod 2004 wood et al 2005 and surface roughness tokunaga and wan 1997 tokunaga et al 2000 under inertia driven conditions the vg model cannot accurately model the occurring processes of advancing wetting fronts however it is valid to approximate these dynamics at the lower saturation limit i e dry conditions with a minimum hydraulic conductivity applying composite vg parameters and a minimum relative conductivity is a heuristic approximation of the occurring physical processes it should be noted that kordilla et al 2012 applied a very similar approach to model groundwater flow in a karst aquifer in contrast to this study a simpler model geometry i e 2d temperate climate with moderate variability of precipitation inputs i e moderate change in state variables and lower vadose zone thickness constitute the main differences the vg material model as applied by kordilla et al 2012 leads to the inability of preferential infiltration through the second continuum due to high negative pressures of the matrix continuum under dry conditions kordilla et al 2012 circumvented this shortcoming by directly adding a predefined fraction of the net infiltration to the groundwater table in contrast this study applies a composite vg material model for both continua in addition we truncate the vg material model of the second continuum using a minimum relative conductivity to allow for preferential infiltration through the second continuum under dry conditions consequently the applied method still describes the flow in terms of capillary and gravitational forces however we approximate inertia driven infiltration heuristically with the minimum relative conductivity which is a necessary abstraction of the occurring processes given the scale of investigation and unknown dimensions of conduits and fractures also other bulk effective and discrete approaches have been developed recently to deal with fractured porous systems two dimensional analytical and numerical solutions such as those provided by moutsopoulos 2021 are suitable to simulate unconfined dual permeability systems however they cannot capture all relevant processes due to the three dimensional setting and heterogeneous distribution of hydrogeological and hydrological properties within the wma discrete modeling approaches such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph simulations kordilla et al 2017 shigorina et al 2021 are a promising approach to improve the physical representation of inertia driven infiltration processes shigorina et al 2021 combines sph for inertia driven flow through fractures with a bulk effective approach based on richards equation for the unsaturated flow through the matrix however those approaches demand high computation power and are currently limited to the scale of individual fractures or a series of a few fractures in addition other discrete approaches such as discrete fracture network models hyman et al 2015 can often not be implemented on a catchment scale due to the missing information about their location geometry and extent of individual conduits or fractures here bulk effective approaches such as dual permeability models reconcile low data requirements with accurate physical representation furthermore this study applies a dual medium water balance model to estimate the partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and infiltration this approach has some advantages compared to the previously commonly applied linear regression models e g berger 1999 weiss and gvirtzman 2007 abusaada 2011 such as that it heuristically accounts for the duality of infiltration and considers the temporal variability of precipitation however the model accounts for the occurring processes in a lumped physical manner and some processes are simplified applying the globally implicit integrated surface subsurface approach within hgs would further improve the predictive capabilities since it accounts for depth integrated surface flow and the natural partitioning of precipitation into runoff evapotranspiration and infiltration however currently employed solvers and parallelization schemes of hgs due to computational limitations i e maximum speed up of 2 3 by addition of parallel resources see section 2 3 currently do not allow implementing surface processes on top of an already highly complex subsurface flow model thus given the current parallelization scheme numerical implementations and available computational resources we believe in having reached the present day maximum conceivable process representation for a catchment of this scale and vadose zone thickness preexisting catchment scale models of the wma e g bachmat 1995 bachmat and wolman 2000 dafny et al 2010 guttman and zukerman 1995 abusaada 2011 neglect the effect of a several hundred meter thick vadose zone on infiltration dynamics and apply parameters with lumped physical meaning e g indirect representation of vadose zone flow and the separating aquitard via highly anisotropic hydraulic conductivities also they apply simple linear correlations of precipitation and recharge neglecting the spatial and temporal variation of recharge and the storage effect of the vadose zone therefore these models are subject to higher structural uncertainty e g caused by the non physical representation of the infiltration process than the proposed model and are more likely prone to parameter degeneration i e non physical values furthermore as in many mediterranean karst aquifers the unsaturated storage capacity may vary significantly with time and space for aquifers with vadose zones of several hundred meters therefore it is necessary to consider the superposition of rapid recharge via fractures and dissolution features e g dolines shafts and long term diffuse infiltration via the matrix domain particularly in the light of the imminent changing precipitation patterns due to climate change effects investigating the effect of changing rainfall patterns because of shifting climates requires a process based approach that accounts for as many relevant physical processes as possible brouyére et al 2004 cuthbert and tindimugaya 2010 moeck et al 2018 further the dual permeability model provides more realistic estimates of the global hydraulic parameters due to the lower structural uncertainty at the expense of computational time in this study we have demonstrated that variably saturated flow in a thick vadose zone has a considerable impact on the dissipation of the hydraulic signal on the catchment scale the presented model expands the predictive options compared to previously employed approaches by accounting for fully distributed i e time and space dependent vadose storage dynamics with the ability to simulate rapid infiltration the change in storage in the vadose and the phreatic zone and the characteristics of the karst system dynamics the constructed flow model has considerable advantages compared to currently available models allowing to predict spatio temporally distributed recharge and infiltration in addition the non linear response of groundwater recharge to transient climatic inputs requires a daily resolution for the analysis lastly the flow model provides insight into the infiltration dynamics at the catchment scale i e mean residence times in the vadose zone characterized by a potential dependent exchange between slow diffuse and fast flow systems hence it predicts the ability to control the long term release of water consequently the model can predict groundwater flow and infiltration dynamics under changing climates with extremes that expand beyond previously experienced conditions for example climate change simulations project that average long term precipitation will decrease yet the intensity and frequency of short duration extreme rainfall events will increase bucchignani et al 2018 hochman et al 2018 adinolfi et al 2020 together with increased potential evapotranspiration it will affect the water budget of mediterranean karst aquifers accordingly the proposed model may predict available water resources under climate change and support decision makers in planning the required scaling of more costly alternative water sources such as desalinated water and treated greywater in addition the model can be used to assess the potential for managed aquifer recharge applications i e infiltration ponds dry wells to mitigate the effects of drought years the proposed model may also assist in developing more elaborate transfer functions for vadose storage dynamics since it provides fully distributed information about the storage in the vadose zone thus it may aid in demonstrating weaknesses of process abstraction and improving less complex numerical

8536,as mountainous areas provide abundant water resources to lower elevations and alpine zones are major recharge areas for water resources it is important to understand water storage and discharge processes in these zones regarding water storage sedimentary structures e g talus and moraines in alpine zones function as aquifers however the functions of vegetation thought to contribute to water recharge and storage in forested watersheds have rarely been investigated accordingly we evaluated the influence of alpine vegetation on water storage processes in alpine zones two intensive field surveys were conducted on august 17 and october 5 2019 in the alpine headwaters of mt norikura in the northern japan alps chemical analyses were conducted of rainwater snowmelt water and runoff water from bare and vegetated catchments from the results a two component separation was conducted to calculate the contributions of precipitation and groundwater components to runoff water our results implied that runoff water from vegetated catchments was in contact with the regolith for longer with the contribution of groundwater being higher in this runoff water moreover the groundwater component contribution tended to increase as the ratio of vegetation area to bare area in each catchment increased suggesting a higher water storage function for vegetated areas in other words the subsurface water flow should be slower in vegetated areas due to the presence of vegetated soils compared to bare areas where coarse grained sediments are dominant accordingly the alpine vegetated area has a higher water storage function than the alpine bare area abbreviations dem digital elevation model ec electrical conductivity tds total dissolved solids keywords alpine zone land cover alpine vegetation water storage function component separation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mountainous areas are regarded as water towers because of their high water potential and recognized as major water recharge areas providing water to downstream areas with higher human activity viviroli et al 2020 in japan precipitation generally increases along with elevation suzuki et al 2008 providing abundant rainwater to mountainous areas low temperatures often cause temporary storage of precipitation snow and ice on the ground surface that delays the conversion of precipitation to runoff leading to a stable supply of downstream water resources during the snowmelt season cochand et al 2019 precipitation and snowmelt in mountainous areas are crucial for sustainable livelihoods in arid and semi arid regions e g the andean and himalayan foothills that experience a dry season from snowmelt to summer barnett et al 2005 viviroli et al 2020 predicted an increase in the population using water resources from mountainous areas to 1 5 billion by 2050 accordingly understanding the water environment and hydrological cycle in mountainous areas including alpine zones is a crucial issue however relevant international studies are lacking owing to the difficulty of access and restrictions to protect wilderness areas leading to a knowledge gap about the water environment and water cycle in alpine areas clow et al 2003 in alpine zones water is stored temporarily in unconsolidated sediments unique to such areas e g talus moraine afterward reaching the bedrock where a part of water infiltrates into the bedrock and the rest discharges as runoff investigations of the spatial distribution of groundwater using ground penetrating radar seismic refraction tomography and electrical resistivity tomography in the headwaters of the rocky mountains e g mcclymont et al 2011 christensen et al 2020 have revealed thin saturated zones on the surface of the bedrock such studies have confirmed the storage of water on the bedrock surface particularly in its staircase shape and hollows this information highlights the importance of bedrock surface topography for the groundwater storage function in alpine zones these studies confirmed that impermeable layers e g fine grained sand frozen soil and rock glaciers inside the talus and moraines prevent water infiltration whereby a thin saturated zone forms on their surfaces water retention at the surface of fine grained sand layers has also been observed in the alpine catchment of the tibetan plateau by hu et al 2019 who investigated geologic structures employing core drilling and groundwater level monitoring hayashi 2020 indicated that the surface topography and fracture structure of bedrock and the presence of impermeable layers are probably responsible for temporal water storage in sedimentary structures such storage occurs despite the rapid infiltration of water in talus and moraines owing to the predominance of coarse grained sediments cochand et al 2019 showed that unconsolidated sediments could contribute to reducing the water flow rate and increasing recharge to the underlying bedrock groundwater the combination of sedimentary landforms acting as aquifers is considered to maintain the base flow of mountain rivers gordon et al 2015 chang et al 2018 these studies have emphasized the importance of assessing water storage and runoff processes in alpine zones the considerable contribution of groundwater in alpine zones to maintaining the baseflow in downstream rivers has been estimated quantitatively by applying component separation using the mixing model concept e g liu et al 2004 frisbee et al 2011 muir et al 2011 engel et al 2016 chang et al 2018 schmieder et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 liu et al 2004 separated stream water into three components namely surface flow precipitation baseflow and talus water in the headwater catchment of the rocky mountains the tracer was set based on principal component analysis using ec dissolved ions ca2 mg2 na so4 2 silicon si concentrations acid neutralization capacity anc and the oxygen stable isotope ratio δ18o the contribution of each end component to the total discharge during the snowmelt season may october was calculated at 36 28 and 36 respectively the contribution of groundwater baseflow talus water was high 64 emphasizing the importance of understanding the exchange between surface water and groundwater in the alpine zone schmieder et al 2018 conducted component separation of runoff water during snowmelt events in a high elevation catchment in the austrian alps using ec and δ18o as tracers they showed that the contributions of groundwater glacial melt water and precipitation components to runoff water were 49 35 and 10 respectively these results indicated a higher contribution of groundwater than that of glacial melt water muir et al 2011 separated runoff water during precipitation events into two components namely new water water from the event and old water water stored in the watershed prior to the event in the headwater catchment of the rocky mountains using δ18o as tracer the results showed that the contribution of old water was 70 90 indicating that groundwater flows out even during precipitation events the high proportion of groundwater components in mountain rivers implies that groundwater stored in alpine headwaters probably contributes to maintaining the base flow of such rivers this conclusion is supported by studies using the water balance e g gordon et al 2015 several studies in low elevation areas consider differences in land cover as a controlling factor in water storage functions and runoff characteristics eltahir and bras 1996 studies have also focused on changes in water runoff processes associated with deforestation and the regeneration and development stages of forests asano et al 2004 showed that the amount of bedrock derived solute output to the stream was higher in vegetated catchments than in non vegetated catchments in addition employing discharge monitoring e g lana renault et al 2011 and numerical simulations e g peña arancibia et al 2019 investigations have suggested that forests reduce peak discharge and maintain base flow during dry no rainfall periods forested watersheds have higher water storage functions than grassland watersheds according to studies using the mixing model concept neill et al 2011 birch et al 2021 sakakibara et al 2019 have shown that old water stored in deeper subsurface areas discharges in response to rainstorm events suggesting that forests play a significant role in storing water these water recharge and storage functions derive from forest processes such as interception transpiration and infiltration into soil and rock layers in zero order basins containing relatively shallow soils soil depth has a significant effect on water storage and yield of stormflow and deeper soils delay hydrologic response to storms sidle et al 1995 sidle et al 2000 the high infiltration capacity of forest soils is maintained by two factors namely a large amount of soil pore space where water is stored by the root system and well developed tree trunks and o horizon that disperse raindrop energy at the ground surface neary et al 2009 several studies have focused on source watersheds in alpine zones such as the rocky mountains european alps and andes where snow and ice deposited in winter are the main water sources somers and mckenzie 2020 the base rock is exposed in the headwaters of these areas with sparse vegetation cover therefore few studies have evaluated the water cycle in catchments where sufficient rainfall occurs even in summer and vegetation is developed well it is important to understand the hydrological cycle in regions that experience abundant rainfall and dynamic hydrological cycles occur even in summer e g the asian monsoon climate region sakakibara and suzuki 2022 asfaha et al 2015 have shown that peak discharge during precipitation events is correlated negatively with vegetation coverage even in mountainous watersheds with steep slopes peña arancibia et al 2019 have noted that the transformation of the hydrological cycle owing to land cover change is greater at smaller scales such as individual headwater catchments alpine headwaters are susceptible to climate change and concerns are being raised about changes in water circulation processes owing to upward shifts in vegetation distribution e g takahashi and yoshida 2009 and changes in snow and ice environments e g messerli et al 2004 such factors illustrate the importance of evaluating the influence of vegetation on the hydrological cycle in alpine zones however little is known about how alpine shrub communities control water storage and runoff processes in alpine headwaters the aim of our study was clarifying whether alpine vegetated areas do function as water storage areas and determining which factors contribute to such function for this purpose we compared the quality of runoff water from bare and vegetated catchments in an alpine headwater catchment 2 study site the study area is mt norikura a stratovolcano located at the southern end of the northern japan alps fig 1 the main peak of mt norikura is kengamine 3026 m a s l and it has an alpine headwater area mt norikura formed during the mid pleistocene to holocene period and it is part of the norikura volcanic belt which extends approximately 5 km from north to south nakano et al 1987 fallen tephra layers consisting of clayey volcanic ash and scoriae assumed to have been formed by eruptive activity are distributed in the area the occurrence of the latest activity is estimated at approximately 9000 years ago okuno et al 1994 the mountains tops are covered with andesite and dacite mainly comprising plagioclase 55 pyroxene 15 orthopyroxene 10 and quartz 10 anazawa and ohmori 2005 according to sakakibara and suzuki 2022 the air temperature varied between 19 9 and 20 0 from october 2018 to september 2019 and between 2 4 and 20 0 from july 2019 to september 2019 in addition sakakibara and suzuki 2022 has shown that the total precipitation over approximately three months july september 2019 was 1581 4 mm the main land cover types are bare and vegetated areas the bare area is covered with rock debris produced and transported by periglacial action an overgrown snow valley is visible at the end of winter the snowline retreats from the beginning of june to the end of october to an altitude of approximately 2700 m in vegetated areas an alpine shrub community dominated by pinus pumila is developed in the range 2500 2850 m a s l and pinus pumila is distributed in patches from 2850 m a s l to the summit 3026 m a s l takahashi and yoshida 2009 various alpine plants grow here such as lingonberry vaccinium vitis idaea and koiwakagami schizocodon soldanelloides f alpinus in the vegetated areas the soil is developed well shibata et al 1976 conducted a study close to the study site at an elevation of 2750 m on the eastern slope of mt norikura identifying a horizon 0 15 0 40 m deep and b horizon 0 40 0 80 m deep that consist of volcanic ash and gravel a thick o horizon of approximately 0 10 0 20 m had formed owing to low temperatures in the alpine zone beyond the tree line and the interception of wind and solar radiation by alpine shrub communities koizumi et al 2018 shibata et al 1976 several gullies occur in this basin and the valley bottoms of the gullies become streams with intermittent runoff after rainfall events 3 material and methods 3 1 calculation of vegetated area we analyzed data from a 1 m mesh digital elevation model dem and aerial photographs matsumoto erosion control office ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism watershed analysis was conducted using the hydrological analysis tool arcgis esri usa and aerial photographs were extracted into the shape of the catchment area for each water sampling point imagej a public domain java image processing program was used to measure the vegetation cover area in each extracted catchment shape the extracted shape images were converted into grayscale images subsequently one of the multiple inflection points in the grayscale intensity histogram was set manually as the threshold separating the vegetated and bare areas referring to the aerial photograph we defined pixels with luminance lower than the threshold as vegetation areas and measured the number of pixels the number of pixels in the measured vegetation area was converted to an area by referring to the overall number of pixels in the catchment area 3 2 hydrological observation and chemical analysis precipitation and stream water levels were observed at the gauging station at 2600 m a s l in the catchment with an area of 0 16 km2 from july 5 to october 5 2019 fig 1 please refer to sakakibara and suzuki 2022 for a detailed description of the methods used to obtain the precipitation and stream level data and the results two intensive field surveys were conducted immediately after rainfall events namely on august 17 2019 163 4 mm day precipitation on august 16 and october 5 2019 84 8 mm day precipitation on october 4 water samples were collected at 18 sites runoff water from a bare catchment at 10 sites runoff water from a vegetated catchment at 7 sites and snowmelt water at 1 site fig 1 runoff water from the talus deposit was sampled as runoff water from a bare catchment and that from the pinus pumila forest as runoff water from a vegetated catchment runoff from both of these catchments persisted during the entire snowmelt season while runoff only from the vegetated catchment continued after snowmelt during the study period rainwater was collected six times at the gauging station however one of the rain samples was eliminated from the analysis because the rain sampler had been destroyed by strong winds or wild animals the water temperature was measured in situ using a digital water temperature meter asf 270t asone japan and ph and ec of each water sample were measured with a portable water quality meter d 200 2 horiba japan the samples were filtered using a 0 22 µm pore size syringe filter and the concentrations of major inorganic dissolved ions f cl no3 so4 2 na nh4 k mg2 ca2 were analyzed by ion chromatography ics 1500 ics 2100 dionex usa the bicarbonate ion concentration hco3 was analyzed by sulfuric acid titration using the ph 4 8 alkalinity titration method the ion balance including considering hydrogen ions was less than 4 6 for all water samples implying sufficient analytical accuracy 3 3 component separation of runoff we assessed the water storage function in the vegetated area of an alpine headwater basin because the degree of groundwater contribution to runoff water could reflect the water storage function we separated the components of the runoff water a simple runoff model was constructed we defined water adequately affected by rock weathering as groundwater rainwater falling in the basin and the meltwater of ice and snow originating from precipitation were defined as precipitation runoff water was assumed to consist of groundwater and precipitation components then we separated the runoff water into two components namely precipitation and groundwater using the following equations sklash and farvolden 1979 1 r gw r p 1 2 c gw r gw c p r p c d where r is the contribution of each component to runoff c is the tracer value and subscripts gw p and d represent groundwater precipitation and discharge runoff water respectively we used the ratios of sodium ions to hydrogen ions na h and magnesium ions to hydrogen ions mg2 h 2 as tracers in conducting the component separation anazawa and ohomori 2005 theoretically showed that the following relationship holds for the amounts of dissolved ions in water samples affected adequately by rock weathering in the mt norikura region which includes the study area 3 l o g mg 2 h 2 l o g na h 0 84 1 this equation is useful for separating runoff water into groundwater and precipitation components generally mg2 na and h concentrations in groundwater mainly change because of rock weathering however most minerals in our study area are feldspar and pyroxene with extremely small dissolution rates 10 12 10 16 mol m 2 s 1 depending on temperature and other conditions kim 2002 white and brantley 2003 we collected the runoff water immediately after rainfall events and we expected a brief interaction time between the precipitation components contributing to the runoff and the regolith in this paper we commonly refer to shallow bedrock coarse grained sediment and soil as regolith the brief time scale of the two component separation and the conservative tracers used implied that the tracer values of the runoff water and each component would likely not change 4 results 4 1 vegetated area table 1 lists the area and vegetation cover rates calculated by watershed analysis using arcgis and image analysis the catchments for n6 and n8 are unclear in the watershed analysis although it was confirmed that water flows from the base of vegetation the vegetation cover rates in the bare and vegetated catchments are 21 6 12 8 and 77 4 22 1 respectively the calculated vegetation cover rate of the vegetated catchments is higher than that of bare catchments indicating that our classification method for runoff water is reasonable however the vegetation cover rate 46 7 for n10 bare catchment is higher than that 45 7 for n15 vegetated catchment in the n10 catchment vegetation is distributed sparsely only on the ridges and vegetation soils are likely less developed in this catchment than in other vegetated catchments accordingly classifying n10 as runoff water from a bare catchment is not problematic 4 2 hydro chemical characteristics fig 2 shows the temporal variations in precipitation and stream water levels at the gauging station throughout the observation period the stream water level clearly responds to precipitation rising immediately after precipitation and dropping rapidly afterward precipitation of 163 4 mm is observed on august 16 the day before the first intensive field survey august 17 the stream water level started rising at 19 50 on august 15 reaching its highest level 0 27 m at 9 50 on august 16 subsequently decreasing to 0 m at 11 50 on august 18 on october 4 the day before the second intensive field survey october 5 84 8 mm of precipitation was observed the stream water level started rising at 9 40 a m on october 4 reaching its highest level 0 10 m at 16 50 a m on the same day and declining afterward the relationship between ph and ec of the sampled water is shown in fig 3 rainwater and snowmelt water ph is 5 1 5 5 i e lower than that of runoff water the ph of runoff water from the bare catchments 5 4 6 1 tends to be lower than that from vegetated catchments 5 6 6 5 similar to ph the ec of rainwater and snowmelt water is lower 0 20 0 46 ms m than that of runoff water and the ec of runoff water from bare catchment 0 20 0 74 ms m tends to be lower than that of runoff water from vegetated catchments 0 38 1 18 ms m runoff water from vegetated catchments has the highest ph and ec among the watersheds fig 4 shows the water quality of rain snowmelt and runoff water the five sites including snowmelt water n1 n3 n4 n5 and n8 temporally dried up on october 5 and the figure does not show these results the water quality at each location remains unchanged between august and october the total dissolved ion concentration is clearly higher in runoff water 78 0 33 6 µeq l than in rainwater 16 0 3 0 µeq l or snowmelt water 17 2 µeq l i e similar to the ec trend the dissolved ion concentrations of the runoff water in bare and vegetated catchments are 73 2 32 5 µeq l and 90 7 38 0 µeq l respectively i e runoff water from vegetated catchments has higher amounts of dissolved content than that from bare catchments the water quality composition of runoff water from bare and vegetated catchments was characterized as types ca no3 and na k hco3 respectively the monovalent cation na k concentration relative to divalent cations ca2 mg2 in runoff water appeared to be higher in the vegetated catchments in the bare catchments hco3 had the lowest anion content but the highest in the vegetated catchments except for n14 october n15 august and october and n16 august the highest anion content in the runoff n14 n15 and n16 was so4 2 4 3 mixing of precipitation and groundwater the relationship between log na h and log mg2 h 2 for all water samples is shown in fig 5 the solid line represents the theoretical line indicating water quality derived from rock weathering as clarified by anazawa and ohomori 2005 samples of precipitation origin rainwater and snowmelt water plot far from the theoretical line whereas some runoff water n17 and n18 plot almost on the line the other runoff water is distributed on a straight line connecting water deriving from precipitation and some runoff water n17 and n18 the plots representing runoff water from bare catchments are located closer to the precipitation samples most runoff water from vegetated catchments plots close to n17 and n18 located on the theoretical line fig 6 shows the relationship of tracer values for runoff water and precipitation and groundwater components as described in section 3 3 method the samples of precipitation origin rainwater and snowmelt water are defined as the precipitation component and the runoff water plots on the theoretical line fig 5 as the groundwater component the na h values for the precipitation and groundwater components are 0 2 0 2 and 49 2 15 8 respectively fig 6a their mg2 h 2 values are 0 007 0 003 and 18 7 3 5 respectively fig 6b the na h and mg2 h 2 values of runoff water excluding the two components range from 0 8 to 38 9 and 0 06 11 9 respectively accordingly the tracer values of all runoff water are between those of the two components a hypothesis is formulated from this finding namely that runoff water in the study area could be explained by a mixture of two components i e precipitation and groundwater 4 4 contribution of precipitation and groundwater components to runoff water table 2 shows the contribution of the groundwater component to runoff water with na h and mg2 h 2 as tracers the magnitudes of the values with na h as tracer and mg2 h 2 as tracer do not match but the overall trend is roughly consistent however comparing the standard deviation of each tracer value na h and mg2 h 2 in the groundwater component the deviation of mg2 h 2 is smaller than that of na h fig 6 this finding indicates that the tracer values of the groundwater component is more stable when mg2 h 2 is used as tracer implying mg2 h 2 is a suitable tracer for separating runoff water components the discussion proceeds using the results of the two component separation with mg2 h 2 as tracer fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of each component contribution to runoff water the contribution of the groundwater component varies between 0 3 and 63 8 2 3 3 8 for runoff water from bare catchments and 23 2 22 3 for runoff water from vegetated catchments the groundwater component largely contributes to runoff water from vegetated catchments compared with that from bare catchments the groundwater contribution is particularly high at n15 and n16 54 4 7 2 where so4 2 is high in comparison the contribution of the groundwater component to the runoff water is higher in october than in august this difference is particularly large at n16 with the contribution rate in october being 12 4 higher than that in august 5 discussion 5 1 water quality formation and water runoff processes in alpine zone the rapid response of stream levels to rainfall events in the catchment with an area of 0 16 km2 fig 2 indicates that rainwater is discharged quickly after rainfall events this characteristic can be seen in other small catchments in japan e g sidle et al 1995 katsuyama et al 2000 additionally recent studies have revealed that groundwater in alpine zones contributes to runoff water e g liu et al 2004 zhou et al 2021 accordingly this study assumed that runoff water forms from the mixing of precipitation and groundwater components we separated the runoff water into precipitation and groundwater components the calculated groundwater component contribution to runoff water was 0 3 63 8 and higher in vegetated catchments 23 2 22 3 than in bare catchments 2 3 3 8 this result indicated that vegetated and bare catchments have different groundwater storage functions and or discharge processes fig 8 explains the effect of the presence or absence of vegetation relationship between the ratio of the vegetated area to the bare area and the contribution of the groundwater component a trend is detected of the larger the ratio of vegetated area to bare area the higher would be the groundwater component contribution excluding n14 and n15 this finding suggests that land cover conditions affect the magnitude of the groundwater component contribution to runoff water accordingly such effects could be discussed in terms of water quality the basic water quality values e g ph ec and total dissolved ion concentrations of runoff water from vegetated catchments are higher than those from bare catchments figs 3 and 4 previous studies have shown that the longer the contact time between water and regolith the higher would be the dissolved ion concentration in water owing to dissolution from the regolith baraer et al 2014 as the dissolved ion concentration increases ec increases moreover japanese forest soils have a high acid buffering capacity and basic cations adsorbed on minerals are replaced with h in aqueous solutions resulting in a lower h concentration in the solution ohte and tokuchi 1999 clay minerals with cation exchange groups are formed along with the progression of rock weathering anazawa and ohmori 2005 considered that clay minerals such as kaolinite are formed near the summit of mt norikura the ec and ph and dissolved ion concentration are expected to increase with the progression of water geologic interactions because of the dissolution of basic cations from the regolith and ion exchange in clay minerals accordingly the higher ph ec and dissolved ion concentrations in the runoff water from vegetated catchments compared with that from bare catchments could be attributed to the higher contribution of water with advanced water geologic interactions in the runoff water from vegetated catchments we observed ca no3 and na k hco3 types of water quality mostly in the runoff water from bare and vegetated catchments respectively generally divalent cations in groundwater are replaced by monovalent cations according to the strength of adsorption of basic cations on rocks and soils ca2 mg2 k na along with the progress in the rock water interaction and increase in the proportion of monovalent cations as shown in fig 4 the cation composition of runoff water from bare catchments is characterized by ca2 whereas that from vegetated catchments is characterized by monovalent cations na k runoff with a higher ratio of monovalent cations na k to divalent cations ca2 and mg2 is more common in runoff water from vegetated catchments these results suggest that the quality of runoff water from vegetated catchments could reflect the effects of water quality evolution resulting from longer contact with the regolith these interpretations support the results of the two component separation which indicates high contribution from the groundwater component to the runoff water from vegetated catchments even in a small groundwater flow field such as the headwaters of an alpine zone vegetation cover slows the discharge of precipitation and snowmelt water and increases water geologic contact time and water quality could be affected by its evolution through cation exchange reactions in other words faster flows through coarse grained sediments may be more dominant in bare areas while slower subsurface flows with long times of contact with soil and bedrock may be more dominant in vegetated areas 5 2 role of alpine vegetation in water cycle as suggested in section 5 1 the groundwater component stored in the subsurface zone in vegetated areas contributes to runoff water and here we discuss how alpine vegetation affects the water cycle in alpine zones the most obvious difference between bare and vegetated areas is the presence or absence of vegetation and the most significant effect on the water cycle is the difference in the amount of water reaching the ground surface in bare areas almost 100 of precipitation reaches the ground surface however in vegetated areas part of precipitation evaporates before reaching the ground surface owing to canopy interception toba and ohta 2005 the canopy density of the dominant pinus pumila in the vegetated area of the study site is high at more than 5 m2 m 2 kajimoto 1989 this is sufficient to effectively trap precipitation in the canopy causing abundant water evaporation uehara and kume 2012 calculated a canopy interception rate of 47 based on precipitation including fog water and rainfall in pinus pumila forests in the mt tateyama area of the northern japan alps the canopy interception rate also depends on meteorological conditions and geographical factors however if the canopy interception rate of the pinus pumila forest in the study area followed the results of uehara and kume 2012 the water supply to the ground surface in the vegetated catchments would be approximately half that of bare catchments if transpiration from pinus pumila is considered the total amount of water that could contribute to groundwater recharge and runoff would be even lower therefore the groundwater component cannot be assumed to be stored in the vegetated area by considering only the relationship between the contribution rate of the groundwater component and the presence or absence of vegetation studies have indicated that land cover and land use conditions significantly affect the hydrologic cycle particularly forests that increase water source recharge and delay runoff e g lana renault et al 2011 peña arancibia et al 2019 forest functions derive mainly from forest soils with high permeability and water retention ability asfaha et al 2015 in the pinus pumila forests of the study area soil development was visually confirmed at the time of the field surveys and we focused our discussion on the forest soil horizons outcrop observations revealed a o horizon and relatively thick soil horizons in the vegetated areas the study area is a low temperature alpine zone beyond the tree line and the effects of wind and solar radiation are limited in the pinus pumila forest making it difficult for the temperature to rise and litter to decay consequently a strongly undecayed o horizon of approximately 0 10 0 20 m has formed shibata et al 1976 koizumi et al 2018 as the study area is located within a national park we were unable to conduct cross sectional soil or other surveys that could detrimentally alter the environment therefore the information on the soil horizons presented here derives from a previous study shibata et al 1976 which was conducted in the vicinity of the study site at an elevation of 2 750 m on the eastern slope of mt norikura a horizon in the pinus pumila forest area is 0 15 0 40 m deep and b horizon comprising volcanic ash and gravel is 0 40 0 80 m deep an aggregate structure of 0 2 2 mm accounts for approximately 30 in a horizon and one of more than 2 mm accounts for 50 in b horizon the situation 0 80 m below the surface is not confirmed yet as surveying has not been conducted however the vegetated area is adjacent to the bare area consisting of bedrock of mt norikura and debris layers therefore a reasonable assumption is that soil horizons several meters deep has not formed the thick o horizon and the aggregate structure of the soil indicate that a highly permeable soil horizons has formed the thick o horizon disperses raindrop energy neary et al 2009 and is thought to prevent crusts forming that could reduce the infiltration capacity the o horizon probably also helps prevent soil detachment caused by raindrops and surface runoff thereby reducing soil erosion miyata et al 2009 accordingly it could be assumed that precipitation reaching the forest floor of the pinus pumila forest easily infiltrates the soil horizons despite the high canopy interception rate infiltrated water flows more slowly through soil particles than through the debris layers in bare areas where the grain size is larger this difference in the rate of subterranean water flow is reflected in the water storage function in the alpine vegetation area flow in several bare catchments ceases in october when the snowmelt season ends whereas runoff from vegetated catchments mostly does not figs 4 and 7 this indicates that the soil horizons enables precipitation to be stored temporarily underground rock derived elements such as na and mg2 are probably added to the stored water i e the groundwater component we defined which mixes with rainwater and is discharged studies have revealed that sedimentary structures such as talus and moraines function as aquifers in alpine zones e g clow et al 2003 muir et al 2011 christensen et al 2020 component separation methods have been applied to runoff from alpine headwater basins of various sizes 2 25 4210 km2 previously e g liu et al 2004 frisbee et al 2011 engel et al 2016 chang et al 2018 schmieder et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 the contribution of the groundwater component to runoff water during snowmelt is calculated at 14 60 compared with this value many runoff waters in this study area showed a lower groundwater component contribution probably owing to heavy precipitation in the watershed according to cowie et al 2017 the contribution of each component to runoff varies depending on the amount and timing of snowmelt and precipitation supplies as well as groundwater storage capacity the annual precipitation range in the watersheds is mainly 100 mm to 1500 mm however this study area receives considerable rainfall even during the short summer season 1581 mm 3 months during the study period the catchment area in our study is small 0 0010 0 15 km2 and just below the summit smaller catchments that receive large rainfall inputs have relatively small storage capacities compared to other studies catchments the trend of higher groundwater contribution in october than in august could be attributed to less precipitation in october the role of vegetation in water storage in alpine zones has not been evaluated before however this study suggests that soils formed by the development of alpine vegetation could temporarily store water in the alpine zone and delay rainwater discharge based on water quality components of runoff water and soil horizons in other words this study suggests that the presence of alpine vegetation could enhance storage capacity in alpine zones and that influence of vegetation should be evaluated in the water cycle of alpine zones 5 3 uncertainties of this study and future work the presence of vegetation results in water quality formation processes that differ from those of bare areas the dissolved ion concentration in runoff water is probably controlled by leaching from soil particles by uptake of plant roots and by leaching of deposits and nutrients accumulated on plant tissue surfaces via precipitation in vegetated areas therefore it is necessary to consider the influence of such processes on the values of na h and mg2 h 2 used as conservative tracers in this study shibata 1976 showed that the ph of throughfall in pinus pumila forests ph 3 81 is approximately 1 0 lower than that of rainfall in bare areas ph 4 81 during the same period on mt norikura the interpretation is that the ph of water passing through the forest canopy is probably lower than before passing through it this could be ascribed to h leaching from the vegetation implying that vegetation added 138 01 µeq l of h to water deriving from precipitation according to uehara 2015 the na concentration of precipitation is 5 5µeq l and that of throughfall in pinus pumila forests is 3 8 µeq l on mt tateyama in the northern japan alps these results could also indicate that na uptake by the aboveground portion of the pinus pumila forest is 1 7 µeq l therefore the na h values in precipitation would decrease by 0 00009 before reaching the forest floor the leaching of mg2 from the aboveground portion of the pinus pumila forest is 5 3 µeq l uehara 2015 suggesting that the mg2 h 2 value increases by 0 0003 due to vegetation the tracer values of the runoff water samples excluding the precipitation and groundwater components ranged from 0 8 to 38 9 for na h and from 0 06 to 11 9 for mg2 h 2 this finding suggests negligible influence from vegetation on the water quality before rainfall reaches the forest floor the adsorption strength of basic cations on soil is generally in the order ca2 mg2 k na because na is less easily adsorbed to soil than other cations na concentration is considered a strong indicator of dissolution through rock weathering the results of the two component separation using the ratio of na to h na h as tracer showed that the contribution of the groundwater component was higher in the vegetated catchments table 2 comparing these results with those obtained when mg2 h 2 was used as tracer showed consistent trends although the magnitudes of the values differed therefore the mg2 h 2 value of runoff water is probably not easily affected by the water quality formation processes occurring because of vegetation soil horizons e g ion exchange in clay minerals water quality changes occur in the ground owing to rock weathering the order of stability of minerals to weathering was shown by goldich 1938 according to the report the order of susceptibility to weathering among colored minerals is olivine pyroxene hornblende and biotite among the colorless minerals the order is ca plagioclase na plagioclase potassium feldspar and quartz the dissolution rates of plagioclase and pyroxene common in the study area have been estimated at 10 10 9 10 11 4 mol si m 2 s 1 and 10 9 9 10 10 6 mol si m 2 s 1 respectively fujimoto 1991 plagioclase and pyroxene are most susceptible to weathering but their interaction with water occurs at low velocity shikazono and fujimoto 1996 indicated that the dissolution rate of silicate minerals under natural conditions is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the experimentally estimated dissolution rate according to kim 2002 and white and brantley 2003 the dissolution rate of plagioclase under natural conditions is 10 12 10 16 mol si m 2 s 1 in our study the runoff water was sampled one day after the rainfall events implying we dealt with a short time scale of one rainfall event therefore it is unlikely that water in the catchments deriving from rainfall could be affected by rock weathering or the water quality significantly changed as the water discharged in a short time span however we found that runoff water from vegetated catchments had higher cation concentrations than that from bare catchments suggesting that water retained in the soil for a long time is affected by water rock interactions and contributes to runoff in vegetated areas in addition to the presence or absence of vegetation other factors may also affect the contribution of groundwater components previous studies have shown that the characteristics of rainfall and geologic structures could be such factors in headwater catchments onda et al 2006 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 as sidle et al 2000 revealed changes in soil moisture contents alter runoff pathways this is possible that two catchments with different sediment structures in this study have different runoff pathways in mt norikura according to asai et al 2001 groundwater flows mainly along the geological structure caused by lava flow in the downstream area additionally runoff was observed even after the end of the snowmelt season despite the narrow and unclear catchment boundary of n6 and high dissolved ion concentrations especially sulfate in n15 and n16 this evidence may indicate water circulation deeper within the subsurface with water flowing across topographic catchment boundaries in the future to improve understanding of the hydrological cycle in the alpine zone quantitative evaluation based on field surveys e g discharge rate and residence time of water as well as an understanding of the geological structure could play important roles 6 conclusions we collected and chemically analyzed runoff water from bare and vegetated catchments in alpine headwaters the effect of vegetation on water storage in alpine zones was discussed using chemical data and component separation results runoff water from bare catchments showed mainly ca no3 type water quality whereas that from vegetated catchments showed na k hco3 type the water quality composition clearly differed between bare and vegetated catchments suggesting that runoff water undergoes different water quality formation processes depending on the presence or absence of vegetation runoff water was collected after precipitation events when the stream levels rose all parameters dissolved ion concentrations ec and ph were higher in the runoff than in the rainwater these results suggested that precipitation contributes to runoff water but leached elements are added due to interaction with the regolith however in a short time period elemental leaching from the regolith was most likely not sufficient to alter the quality of precipitation accordingly we believe that groundwater is discharged and mixed with the precipitation component forming the quality of runoff water we separated runoff water into precipitation and groundwater components using chemical tracers e g mg2 h 2 which reflect information on water that has been affected sufficiently by rock weathering our results indicated that the contribution of groundwater to runoff ranged from 0 3 to 63 8 and was clearly higher in runoff water from vegetated catchments 23 2 22 3 than from bare catchments 2 3 3 8 the relationship between the contribution of the groundwater component and the ratio of vegetated area to bare area in each catchment showed a positive correlation these results suggested that the higher the percentage of vegetation cover the greater would be the groundwater contribution to runoff our finding implies that alpine vegetation not traditionally recognized for its water storage ability could temporarily hold water in the subsurface area it also implies the need to assess the presence of vegetation to understand the hydrological cycle in mountainous areas especially in alpine zones which supply water resources to downstream areas the discussion was deepened regarding the delay between

8536,as mountainous areas provide abundant water resources to lower elevations and alpine zones are major recharge areas for water resources it is important to understand water storage and discharge processes in these zones regarding water storage sedimentary structures e g talus and moraines in alpine zones function as aquifers however the functions of vegetation thought to contribute to water recharge and storage in forested watersheds have rarely been investigated accordingly we evaluated the influence of alpine vegetation on water storage processes in alpine zones two intensive field surveys were conducted on august 17 and october 5 2019 in the alpine headwaters of mt norikura in the northern japan alps chemical analyses were conducted of rainwater snowmelt water and runoff water from bare and vegetated catchments from the results a two component separation was conducted to calculate the contributions of precipitation and groundwater components to runoff water our results implied that runoff water from vegetated catchments was in contact with the regolith for longer with the contribution of groundwater being higher in this runoff water moreover the groundwater component contribution tended to increase as the ratio of vegetation area to bare area in each catchment increased suggesting a higher water storage function for vegetated areas in other words the subsurface water flow should be slower in vegetated areas due to the presence of vegetated soils compared to bare areas where coarse grained sediments are dominant accordingly the alpine vegetated area has a higher water storage function than the alpine bare area abbreviations dem digital elevation model ec electrical conductivity tds total dissolved solids keywords alpine zone land cover alpine vegetation water storage function component separation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mountainous areas are regarded as water towers because of their high water potential and recognized as major water recharge areas providing water to downstream areas with higher human activity viviroli et al 2020 in japan precipitation generally increases along with elevation suzuki et al 2008 providing abundant rainwater to mountainous areas low temperatures often cause temporary storage of precipitation snow and ice on the ground surface that delays the conversion of precipitation to runoff leading to a stable supply of downstream water resources during the snowmelt season cochand et al 2019 precipitation and snowmelt in mountainous areas are crucial for sustainable livelihoods in arid and semi arid regions e g the andean and himalayan foothills that experience a dry season from snowmelt to summer barnett et al 2005 viviroli et al 2020 predicted an increase in the population using water resources from mountainous areas to 1 5 billion by 2050 accordingly understanding the water environment and hydrological cycle in mountainous areas including alpine zones is a crucial issue however relevant international studies are lacking owing to the difficulty of access and restrictions to protect wilderness areas leading to a knowledge gap about the water environment and water cycle in alpine areas clow et al 2003 in alpine zones water is stored temporarily in unconsolidated sediments unique to such areas e g talus moraine afterward reaching the bedrock where a part of water infiltrates into the bedrock and the rest discharges as runoff investigations of the spatial distribution of groundwater using ground penetrating radar seismic refraction tomography and electrical resistivity tomography in the headwaters of the rocky mountains e g mcclymont et al 2011 christensen et al 2020 have revealed thin saturated zones on the surface of the bedrock such studies have confirmed the storage of water on the bedrock surface particularly in its staircase shape and hollows this information highlights the importance of bedrock surface topography for the groundwater storage function in alpine zones these studies confirmed that impermeable layers e g fine grained sand frozen soil and rock glaciers inside the talus and moraines prevent water infiltration whereby a thin saturated zone forms on their surfaces water retention at the surface of fine grained sand layers has also been observed in the alpine catchment of the tibetan plateau by hu et al 2019 who investigated geologic structures employing core drilling and groundwater level monitoring hayashi 2020 indicated that the surface topography and fracture structure of bedrock and the presence of impermeable layers are probably responsible for temporal water storage in sedimentary structures such storage occurs despite the rapid infiltration of water in talus and moraines owing to the predominance of coarse grained sediments cochand et al 2019 showed that unconsolidated sediments could contribute to reducing the water flow rate and increasing recharge to the underlying bedrock groundwater the combination of sedimentary landforms acting as aquifers is considered to maintain the base flow of mountain rivers gordon et al 2015 chang et al 2018 these studies have emphasized the importance of assessing water storage and runoff processes in alpine zones the considerable contribution of groundwater in alpine zones to maintaining the baseflow in downstream rivers has been estimated quantitatively by applying component separation using the mixing model concept e g liu et al 2004 frisbee et al 2011 muir et al 2011 engel et al 2016 chang et al 2018 schmieder et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 liu et al 2004 separated stream water into three components namely surface flow precipitation baseflow and talus water in the headwater catchment of the rocky mountains the tracer was set based on principal component analysis using ec dissolved ions ca2 mg2 na so4 2 silicon si concentrations acid neutralization capacity anc and the oxygen stable isotope ratio δ18o the contribution of each end component to the total discharge during the snowmelt season may october was calculated at 36 28 and 36 respectively the contribution of groundwater baseflow talus water was high 64 emphasizing the importance of understanding the exchange between surface water and groundwater in the alpine zone schmieder et al 2018 conducted component separation of runoff water during snowmelt events in a high elevation catchment in the austrian alps using ec and δ18o as tracers they showed that the contributions of groundwater glacial melt water and precipitation components to runoff water were 49 35 and 10 respectively these results indicated a higher contribution of groundwater than that of glacial melt water muir et al 2011 separated runoff water during precipitation events into two components namely new water water from the event and old water water stored in the watershed prior to the event in the headwater catchment of the rocky mountains using δ18o as tracer the results showed that the contribution of old water was 70 90 indicating that groundwater flows out even during precipitation events the high proportion of groundwater components in mountain rivers implies that groundwater stored in alpine headwaters probably contributes to maintaining the base flow of such rivers this conclusion is supported by studies using the water balance e g gordon et al 2015 several studies in low elevation areas consider differences in land cover as a controlling factor in water storage functions and runoff characteristics eltahir and bras 1996 studies have also focused on changes in water runoff processes associated with deforestation and the regeneration and development stages of forests asano et al 2004 showed that the amount of bedrock derived solute output to the stream was higher in vegetated catchments than in non vegetated catchments in addition employing discharge monitoring e g lana renault et al 2011 and numerical simulations e g peña arancibia et al 2019 investigations have suggested that forests reduce peak discharge and maintain base flow during dry no rainfall periods forested watersheds have higher water storage functions than grassland watersheds according to studies using the mixing model concept neill et al 2011 birch et al 2021 sakakibara et al 2019 have shown that old water stored in deeper subsurface areas discharges in response to rainstorm events suggesting that forests play a significant role in storing water these water recharge and storage functions derive from forest processes such as interception transpiration and infiltration into soil and rock layers in zero order basins containing relatively shallow soils soil depth has a significant effect on water storage and yield of stormflow and deeper soils delay hydrologic response to storms sidle et al 1995 sidle et al 2000 the high infiltration capacity of forest soils is maintained by two factors namely a large amount of soil pore space where water is stored by the root system and well developed tree trunks and o horizon that disperse raindrop energy at the ground surface neary et al 2009 several studies have focused on source watersheds in alpine zones such as the rocky mountains european alps and andes where snow and ice deposited in winter are the main water sources somers and mckenzie 2020 the base rock is exposed in the headwaters of these areas with sparse vegetation cover therefore few studies have evaluated the water cycle in catchments where sufficient rainfall occurs even in summer and vegetation is developed well it is important to understand the hydrological cycle in regions that experience abundant rainfall and dynamic hydrological cycles occur even in summer e g the asian monsoon climate region sakakibara and suzuki 2022 asfaha et al 2015 have shown that peak discharge during precipitation events is correlated negatively with vegetation coverage even in mountainous watersheds with steep slopes peña arancibia et al 2019 have noted that the transformation of the hydrological cycle owing to land cover change is greater at smaller scales such as individual headwater catchments alpine headwaters are susceptible to climate change and concerns are being raised about changes in water circulation processes owing to upward shifts in vegetation distribution e g takahashi and yoshida 2009 and changes in snow and ice environments e g messerli et al 2004 such factors illustrate the importance of evaluating the influence of vegetation on the hydrological cycle in alpine zones however little is known about how alpine shrub communities control water storage and runoff processes in alpine headwaters the aim of our study was clarifying whether alpine vegetated areas do function as water storage areas and determining which factors contribute to such function for this purpose we compared the quality of runoff water from bare and vegetated catchments in an alpine headwater catchment 2 study site the study area is mt norikura a stratovolcano located at the southern end of the northern japan alps fig 1 the main peak of mt norikura is kengamine 3026 m a s l and it has an alpine headwater area mt norikura formed during the mid pleistocene to holocene period and it is part of the norikura volcanic belt which extends approximately 5 km from north to south nakano et al 1987 fallen tephra layers consisting of clayey volcanic ash and scoriae assumed to have been formed by eruptive activity are distributed in the area the occurrence of the latest activity is estimated at approximately 9000 years ago okuno et al 1994 the mountains tops are covered with andesite and dacite mainly comprising plagioclase 55 pyroxene 15 orthopyroxene 10 and quartz 10 anazawa and ohmori 2005 according to sakakibara and suzuki 2022 the air temperature varied between 19 9 and 20 0 from october 2018 to september 2019 and between 2 4 and 20 0 from july 2019 to september 2019 in addition sakakibara and suzuki 2022 has shown that the total precipitation over approximately three months july september 2019 was 1581 4 mm the main land cover types are bare and vegetated areas the bare area is covered with rock debris produced and transported by periglacial action an overgrown snow valley is visible at the end of winter the snowline retreats from the beginning of june to the end of october to an altitude of approximately 2700 m in vegetated areas an alpine shrub community dominated by pinus pumila is developed in the range 2500 2850 m a s l and pinus pumila is distributed in patches from 2850 m a s l to the summit 3026 m a s l takahashi and yoshida 2009 various alpine plants grow here such as lingonberry vaccinium vitis idaea and koiwakagami schizocodon soldanelloides f alpinus in the vegetated areas the soil is developed well shibata et al 1976 conducted a study close to the study site at an elevation of 2750 m on the eastern slope of mt norikura identifying a horizon 0 15 0 40 m deep and b horizon 0 40 0 80 m deep that consist of volcanic ash and gravel a thick o horizon of approximately 0 10 0 20 m had formed owing to low temperatures in the alpine zone beyond the tree line and the interception of wind and solar radiation by alpine shrub communities koizumi et al 2018 shibata et al 1976 several gullies occur in this basin and the valley bottoms of the gullies become streams with intermittent runoff after rainfall events 3 material and methods 3 1 calculation of vegetated area we analyzed data from a 1 m mesh digital elevation model dem and aerial photographs matsumoto erosion control office ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism watershed analysis was conducted using the hydrological analysis tool arcgis esri usa and aerial photographs were extracted into the shape of the catchment area for each water sampling point imagej a public domain java image processing program was used to measure the vegetation cover area in each extracted catchment shape the extracted shape images were converted into grayscale images subsequently one of the multiple inflection points in the grayscale intensity histogram was set manually as the threshold separating the vegetated and bare areas referring to the aerial photograph we defined pixels with luminance lower than the threshold as vegetation areas and measured the number of pixels the number of pixels in the measured vegetation area was converted to an area by referring to the overall number of pixels in the catchment area 3 2 hydrological observation and chemical analysis precipitation and stream water levels were observed at the gauging station at 2600 m a s l in the catchment with an area of 0 16 km2 from july 5 to october 5 2019 fig 1 please refer to sakakibara and suzuki 2022 for a detailed description of the methods used to obtain the precipitation and stream level data and the results two intensive field surveys were conducted immediately after rainfall events namely on august 17 2019 163 4 mm day precipitation on august 16 and october 5 2019 84 8 mm day precipitation on october 4 water samples were collected at 18 sites runoff water from a bare catchment at 10 sites runoff water from a vegetated catchment at 7 sites and snowmelt water at 1 site fig 1 runoff water from the talus deposit was sampled as runoff water from a bare catchment and that from the pinus pumila forest as runoff water from a vegetated catchment runoff from both of these catchments persisted during the entire snowmelt season while runoff only from the vegetated catchment continued after snowmelt during the study period rainwater was collected six times at the gauging station however one of the rain samples was eliminated from the analysis because the rain sampler had been destroyed by strong winds or wild animals the water temperature was measured in situ using a digital water temperature meter asf 270t asone japan and ph and ec of each water sample were measured with a portable water quality meter d 200 2 horiba japan the samples were filtered using a 0 22 µm pore size syringe filter and the concentrations of major inorganic dissolved ions f cl no3 so4 2 na nh4 k mg2 ca2 were analyzed by ion chromatography ics 1500 ics 2100 dionex usa the bicarbonate ion concentration hco3 was analyzed by sulfuric acid titration using the ph 4 8 alkalinity titration method the ion balance including considering hydrogen ions was less than 4 6 for all water samples implying sufficient analytical accuracy 3 3 component separation of runoff we assessed the water storage function in the vegetated area of an alpine headwater basin because the degree of groundwater contribution to runoff water could reflect the water storage function we separated the components of the runoff water a simple runoff model was constructed we defined water adequately affected by rock weathering as groundwater rainwater falling in the basin and the meltwater of ice and snow originating from precipitation were defined as precipitation runoff water was assumed to consist of groundwater and precipitation components then we separated the runoff water into two components namely precipitation and groundwater using the following equations sklash and farvolden 1979 1 r gw r p 1 2 c gw r gw c p r p c d where r is the contribution of each component to runoff c is the tracer value and subscripts gw p and d represent groundwater precipitation and discharge runoff water respectively we used the ratios of sodium ions to hydrogen ions na h and magnesium ions to hydrogen ions mg2 h 2 as tracers in conducting the component separation anazawa and ohomori 2005 theoretically showed that the following relationship holds for the amounts of dissolved ions in water samples affected adequately by rock weathering in the mt norikura region which includes the study area 3 l o g mg 2 h 2 l o g na h 0 84 1 this equation is useful for separating runoff water into groundwater and precipitation components generally mg2 na and h concentrations in groundwater mainly change because of rock weathering however most minerals in our study area are feldspar and pyroxene with extremely small dissolution rates 10 12 10 16 mol m 2 s 1 depending on temperature and other conditions kim 2002 white and brantley 2003 we collected the runoff water immediately after rainfall events and we expected a brief interaction time between the precipitation components contributing to the runoff and the regolith in this paper we commonly refer to shallow bedrock coarse grained sediment and soil as regolith the brief time scale of the two component separation and the conservative tracers used implied that the tracer values of the runoff water and each component would likely not change 4 results 4 1 vegetated area table 1 lists the area and vegetation cover rates calculated by watershed analysis using arcgis and image analysis the catchments for n6 and n8 are unclear in the watershed analysis although it was confirmed that water flows from the base of vegetation the vegetation cover rates in the bare and vegetated catchments are 21 6 12 8 and 77 4 22 1 respectively the calculated vegetation cover rate of the vegetated catchments is higher than that of bare catchments indicating that our classification method for runoff water is reasonable however the vegetation cover rate 46 7 for n10 bare catchment is higher than that 45 7 for n15 vegetated catchment in the n10 catchment vegetation is distributed sparsely only on the ridges and vegetation soils are likely less developed in this catchment than in other vegetated catchments accordingly classifying n10 as runoff water from a bare catchment is not problematic 4 2 hydro chemical characteristics fig 2 shows the temporal variations in precipitation and stream water levels at the gauging station throughout the observation period the stream water level clearly responds to precipitation rising immediately after precipitation and dropping rapidly afterward precipitation of 163 4 mm is observed on august 16 the day before the first intensive field survey august 17 the stream water level started rising at 19 50 on august 15 reaching its highest level 0 27 m at 9 50 on august 16 subsequently decreasing to 0 m at 11 50 on august 18 on october 4 the day before the second intensive field survey october 5 84 8 mm of precipitation was observed the stream water level started rising at 9 40 a m on october 4 reaching its highest level 0 10 m at 16 50 a m on the same day and declining afterward the relationship between ph and ec of the sampled water is shown in fig 3 rainwater and snowmelt water ph is 5 1 5 5 i e lower than that of runoff water the ph of runoff water from the bare catchments 5 4 6 1 tends to be lower than that from vegetated catchments 5 6 6 5 similar to ph the ec of rainwater and snowmelt water is lower 0 20 0 46 ms m than that of runoff water and the ec of runoff water from bare catchment 0 20 0 74 ms m tends to be lower than that of runoff water from vegetated catchments 0 38 1 18 ms m runoff water from vegetated catchments has the highest ph and ec among the watersheds fig 4 shows the water quality of rain snowmelt and runoff water the five sites including snowmelt water n1 n3 n4 n5 and n8 temporally dried up on october 5 and the figure does not show these results the water quality at each location remains unchanged between august and october the total dissolved ion concentration is clearly higher in runoff water 78 0 33 6 µeq l than in rainwater 16 0 3 0 µeq l or snowmelt water 17 2 µeq l i e similar to the ec trend the dissolved ion concentrations of the runoff water in bare and vegetated catchments are 73 2 32 5 µeq l and 90 7 38 0 µeq l respectively i e runoff water from vegetated catchments has higher amounts of dissolved content than that from bare catchments the water quality composition of runoff water from bare and vegetated catchments was characterized as types ca no3 and na k hco3 respectively the monovalent cation na k concentration relative to divalent cations ca2 mg2 in runoff water appeared to be higher in the vegetated catchments in the bare catchments hco3 had the lowest anion content but the highest in the vegetated catchments except for n14 october n15 august and october and n16 august the highest anion content in the runoff n14 n15 and n16 was so4 2 4 3 mixing of precipitation and groundwater the relationship between log na h and log mg2 h 2 for all water samples is shown in fig 5 the solid line represents the theoretical line indicating water quality derived from rock weathering as clarified by anazawa and ohomori 2005 samples of precipitation origin rainwater and snowmelt water plot far from the theoretical line whereas some runoff water n17 and n18 plot almost on the line the other runoff water is distributed on a straight line connecting water deriving from precipitation and some runoff water n17 and n18 the plots representing runoff water from bare catchments are located closer to the precipitation samples most runoff water from vegetated catchments plots close to n17 and n18 located on the theoretical line fig 6 shows the relationship of tracer values for runoff water and precipitation and groundwater components as described in section 3 3 method the samples of precipitation origin rainwater and snowmelt water are defined as the precipitation component and the runoff water plots on the theoretical line fig 5 as the groundwater component the na h values for the precipitation and groundwater components are 0 2 0 2 and 49 2 15 8 respectively fig 6a their mg2 h 2 values are 0 007 0 003 and 18 7 3 5 respectively fig 6b the na h and mg2 h 2 values of runoff water excluding the two components range from 0 8 to 38 9 and 0 06 11 9 respectively accordingly the tracer values of all runoff water are between those of the two components a hypothesis is formulated from this finding namely that runoff water in the study area could be explained by a mixture of two components i e precipitation and groundwater 4 4 contribution of precipitation and groundwater components to runoff water table 2 shows the contribution of the groundwater component to runoff water with na h and mg2 h 2 as tracers the magnitudes of the values with na h as tracer and mg2 h 2 as tracer do not match but the overall trend is roughly consistent however comparing the standard deviation of each tracer value na h and mg2 h 2 in the groundwater component the deviation of mg2 h 2 is smaller than that of na h fig 6 this finding indicates that the tracer values of the groundwater component is more stable when mg2 h 2 is used as tracer implying mg2 h 2 is a suitable tracer for separating runoff water components the discussion proceeds using the results of the two component separation with mg2 h 2 as tracer fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of each component contribution to runoff water the contribution of the groundwater component varies between 0 3 and 63 8 2 3 3 8 for runoff water from bare catchments and 23 2 22 3 for runoff water from vegetated catchments the groundwater component largely contributes to runoff water from vegetated catchments compared with that from bare catchments the groundwater contribution is particularly high at n15 and n16 54 4 7 2 where so4 2 is high in comparison the contribution of the groundwater component to the runoff water is higher in october than in august this difference is particularly large at n16 with the contribution rate in october being 12 4 higher than that in august 5 discussion 5 1 water quality formation and water runoff processes in alpine zone the rapid response of stream levels to rainfall events in the catchment with an area of 0 16 km2 fig 2 indicates that rainwater is discharged quickly after rainfall events this characteristic can be seen in other small catchments in japan e g sidle et al 1995 katsuyama et al 2000 additionally recent studies have revealed that groundwater in alpine zones contributes to runoff water e g liu et al 2004 zhou et al 2021 accordingly this study assumed that runoff water forms from the mixing of precipitation and groundwater components we separated the runoff water into precipitation and groundwater components the calculated groundwater component contribution to runoff water was 0 3 63 8 and higher in vegetated catchments 23 2 22 3 than in bare catchments 2 3 3 8 this result indicated that vegetated and bare catchments have different groundwater storage functions and or discharge processes fig 8 explains the effect of the presence or absence of vegetation relationship between the ratio of the vegetated area to the bare area and the contribution of the groundwater component a trend is detected of the larger the ratio of vegetated area to bare area the higher would be the groundwater component contribution excluding n14 and n15 this finding suggests that land cover conditions affect the magnitude of the groundwater component contribution to runoff water accordingly such effects could be discussed in terms of water quality the basic water quality values e g ph ec and total dissolved ion concentrations of runoff water from vegetated catchments are higher than those from bare catchments figs 3 and 4 previous studies have shown that the longer the contact time between water and regolith the higher would be the dissolved ion concentration in water owing to dissolution from the regolith baraer et al 2014 as the dissolved ion concentration increases ec increases moreover japanese forest soils have a high acid buffering capacity and basic cations adsorbed on minerals are replaced with h in aqueous solutions resulting in a lower h concentration in the solution ohte and tokuchi 1999 clay minerals with cation exchange groups are formed along with the progression of rock weathering anazawa and ohmori 2005 considered that clay minerals such as kaolinite are formed near the summit of mt norikura the ec and ph and dissolved ion concentration are expected to increase with the progression of water geologic interactions because of the dissolution of basic cations from the regolith and ion exchange in clay minerals accordingly the higher ph ec and dissolved ion concentrations in the runoff water from vegetated catchments compared with that from bare catchments could be attributed to the higher contribution of water with advanced water geologic interactions in the runoff water from vegetated catchments we observed ca no3 and na k hco3 types of water quality mostly in the runoff water from bare and vegetated catchments respectively generally divalent cations in groundwater are replaced by monovalent cations according to the strength of adsorption of basic cations on rocks and soils ca2 mg2 k na along with the progress in the rock water interaction and increase in the proportion of monovalent cations as shown in fig 4 the cation composition of runoff water from bare catchments is characterized by ca2 whereas that from vegetated catchments is characterized by monovalent cations na k runoff with a higher ratio of monovalent cations na k to divalent cations ca2 and mg2 is more common in runoff water from vegetated catchments these results suggest that the quality of runoff water from vegetated catchments could reflect the effects of water quality evolution resulting from longer contact with the regolith these interpretations support the results of the two component separation which indicates high contribution from the groundwater component to the runoff water from vegetated catchments even in a small groundwater flow field such as the headwaters of an alpine zone vegetation cover slows the discharge of precipitation and snowmelt water and increases water geologic contact time and water quality could be affected by its evolution through cation exchange reactions in other words faster flows through coarse grained sediments may be more dominant in bare areas while slower subsurface flows with long times of contact with soil and bedrock may be more dominant in vegetated areas 5 2 role of alpine vegetation in water cycle as suggested in section 5 1 the groundwater component stored in the subsurface zone in vegetated areas contributes to runoff water and here we discuss how alpine vegetation affects the water cycle in alpine zones the most obvious difference between bare and vegetated areas is the presence or absence of vegetation and the most significant effect on the water cycle is the difference in the amount of water reaching the ground surface in bare areas almost 100 of precipitation reaches the ground surface however in vegetated areas part of precipitation evaporates before reaching the ground surface owing to canopy interception toba and ohta 2005 the canopy density of the dominant pinus pumila in the vegetated area of the study site is high at more than 5 m2 m 2 kajimoto 1989 this is sufficient to effectively trap precipitation in the canopy causing abundant water evaporation uehara and kume 2012 calculated a canopy interception rate of 47 based on precipitation including fog water and rainfall in pinus pumila forests in the mt tateyama area of the northern japan alps the canopy interception rate also depends on meteorological conditions and geographical factors however if the canopy interception rate of the pinus pumila forest in the study area followed the results of uehara and kume 2012 the water supply to the ground surface in the vegetated catchments would be approximately half that of bare catchments if transpiration from pinus pumila is considered the total amount of water that could contribute to groundwater recharge and runoff would be even lower therefore the groundwater component cannot be assumed to be stored in the vegetated area by considering only the relationship between the contribution rate of the groundwater component and the presence or absence of vegetation studies have indicated that land cover and land use conditions significantly affect the hydrologic cycle particularly forests that increase water source recharge and delay runoff e g lana renault et al 2011 peña arancibia et al 2019 forest functions derive mainly from forest soils with high permeability and water retention ability asfaha et al 2015 in the pinus pumila forests of the study area soil development was visually confirmed at the time of the field surveys and we focused our discussion on the forest soil horizons outcrop observations revealed a o horizon and relatively thick soil horizons in the vegetated areas the study area is a low temperature alpine zone beyond the tree line and the effects of wind and solar radiation are limited in the pinus pumila forest making it difficult for the temperature to rise and litter to decay consequently a strongly undecayed o horizon of approximately 0 10 0 20 m has formed shibata et al 1976 koizumi et al 2018 as the study area is located within a national park we were unable to conduct cross sectional soil or other surveys that could detrimentally alter the environment therefore the information on the soil horizons presented here derives from a previous study shibata et al 1976 which was conducted in the vicinity of the study site at an elevation of 2 750 m on the eastern slope of mt norikura a horizon in the pinus pumila forest area is 0 15 0 40 m deep and b horizon comprising volcanic ash and gravel is 0 40 0 80 m deep an aggregate structure of 0 2 2 mm accounts for approximately 30 in a horizon and one of more than 2 mm accounts for 50 in b horizon the situation 0 80 m below the surface is not confirmed yet as surveying has not been conducted however the vegetated area is adjacent to the bare area consisting of bedrock of mt norikura and debris layers therefore a reasonable assumption is that soil horizons several meters deep has not formed the thick o horizon and the aggregate structure of the soil indicate that a highly permeable soil horizons has formed the thick o horizon disperses raindrop energy neary et al 2009 and is thought to prevent crusts forming that could reduce the infiltration capacity the o horizon probably also helps prevent soil detachment caused by raindrops and surface runoff thereby reducing soil erosion miyata et al 2009 accordingly it could be assumed that precipitation reaching the forest floor of the pinus pumila forest easily infiltrates the soil horizons despite the high canopy interception rate infiltrated water flows more slowly through soil particles than through the debris layers in bare areas where the grain size is larger this difference in the rate of subterranean water flow is reflected in the water storage function in the alpine vegetation area flow in several bare catchments ceases in october when the snowmelt season ends whereas runoff from vegetated catchments mostly does not figs 4 and 7 this indicates that the soil horizons enables precipitation to be stored temporarily underground rock derived elements such as na and mg2 are probably added to the stored water i e the groundwater component we defined which mixes with rainwater and is discharged studies have revealed that sedimentary structures such as talus and moraines function as aquifers in alpine zones e g clow et al 2003 muir et al 2011 christensen et al 2020 component separation methods have been applied to runoff from alpine headwater basins of various sizes 2 25 4210 km2 previously e g liu et al 2004 frisbee et al 2011 engel et al 2016 chang et al 2018 schmieder et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 the contribution of the groundwater component to runoff water during snowmelt is calculated at 14 60 compared with this value many runoff waters in this study area showed a lower groundwater component contribution probably owing to heavy precipitation in the watershed according to cowie et al 2017 the contribution of each component to runoff varies depending on the amount and timing of snowmelt and precipitation supplies as well as groundwater storage capacity the annual precipitation range in the watersheds is mainly 100 mm to 1500 mm however this study area receives considerable rainfall even during the short summer season 1581 mm 3 months during the study period the catchment area in our study is small 0 0010 0 15 km2 and just below the summit smaller catchments that receive large rainfall inputs have relatively small storage capacities compared to other studies catchments the trend of higher groundwater contribution in october than in august could be attributed to less precipitation in october the role of vegetation in water storage in alpine zones has not been evaluated before however this study suggests that soils formed by the development of alpine vegetation could temporarily store water in the alpine zone and delay rainwater discharge based on water quality components of runoff water and soil horizons in other words this study suggests that the presence of alpine vegetation could enhance storage capacity in alpine zones and that influence of vegetation should be evaluated in the water cycle of alpine zones 5 3 uncertainties of this study and future work the presence of vegetation results in water quality formation processes that differ from those of bare areas the dissolved ion concentration in runoff water is probably controlled by leaching from soil particles by uptake of plant roots and by leaching of deposits and nutrients accumulated on plant tissue surfaces via precipitation in vegetated areas therefore it is necessary to consider the influence of such processes on the values of na h and mg2 h 2 used as conservative tracers in this study shibata 1976 showed that the ph of throughfall in pinus pumila forests ph 3 81 is approximately 1 0 lower than that of rainfall in bare areas ph 4 81 during the same period on mt norikura the interpretation is that the ph of water passing through the forest canopy is probably lower than before passing through it this could be ascribed to h leaching from the vegetation implying that vegetation added 138 01 µeq l of h to water deriving from precipitation according to uehara 2015 the na concentration of precipitation is 5 5µeq l and that of throughfall in pinus pumila forests is 3 8 µeq l on mt tateyama in the northern japan alps these results could also indicate that na uptake by the aboveground portion of the pinus pumila forest is 1 7 µeq l therefore the na h values in precipitation would decrease by 0 00009 before reaching the forest floor the leaching of mg2 from the aboveground portion of the pinus pumila forest is 5 3 µeq l uehara 2015 suggesting that the mg2 h 2 value increases by 0 0003 due to vegetation the tracer values of the runoff water samples excluding the precipitation and groundwater components ranged from 0 8 to 38 9 for na h and from 0 06 to 11 9 for mg2 h 2 this finding suggests negligible influence from vegetation on the water quality before rainfall reaches the forest floor the adsorption strength of basic cations on soil is generally in the order ca2 mg2 k na because na is less easily adsorbed to soil than other cations na concentration is considered a strong indicator of dissolution through rock weathering the results of the two component separation using the ratio of na to h na h as tracer showed that the contribution of the groundwater component was higher in the vegetated catchments table 2 comparing these results with those obtained when mg2 h 2 was used as tracer showed consistent trends although the magnitudes of the values differed therefore the mg2 h 2 value of runoff water is probably not easily affected by the water quality formation processes occurring because of vegetation soil horizons e g ion exchange in clay minerals water quality changes occur in the ground owing to rock weathering the order of stability of minerals to weathering was shown by goldich 1938 according to the report the order of susceptibility to weathering among colored minerals is olivine pyroxene hornblende and biotite among the colorless minerals the order is ca plagioclase na plagioclase potassium feldspar and quartz the dissolution rates of plagioclase and pyroxene common in the study area have been estimated at 10 10 9 10 11 4 mol si m 2 s 1 and 10 9 9 10 10 6 mol si m 2 s 1 respectively fujimoto 1991 plagioclase and pyroxene are most susceptible to weathering but their interaction with water occurs at low velocity shikazono and fujimoto 1996 indicated that the dissolution rate of silicate minerals under natural conditions is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the experimentally estimated dissolution rate according to kim 2002 and white and brantley 2003 the dissolution rate of plagioclase under natural conditions is 10 12 10 16 mol si m 2 s 1 in our study the runoff water was sampled one day after the rainfall events implying we dealt with a short time scale of one rainfall event therefore it is unlikely that water in the catchments deriving from rainfall could be affected by rock weathering or the water quality significantly changed as the water discharged in a short time span however we found that runoff water from vegetated catchments had higher cation concentrations than that from bare catchments suggesting that water retained in the soil for a long time is affected by water rock interactions and contributes to runoff in vegetated areas in addition to the presence or absence of vegetation other factors may also affect the contribution of groundwater components previous studies have shown that the characteristics of rainfall and geologic structures could be such factors in headwater catchments onda et al 2006 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 as sidle et al 2000 revealed changes in soil moisture contents alter runoff pathways this is possible that two catchments with different sediment structures in this study have different runoff pathways in mt norikura according to asai et al 2001 groundwater flows mainly along the geological structure caused by lava flow in the downstream area additionally runoff was observed even after the end of the snowmelt season despite the narrow and unclear catchment boundary of n6 and high dissolved ion concentrations especially sulfate in n15 and n16 this evidence may indicate water circulation deeper within the subsurface with water flowing across topographic catchment boundaries in the future to improve understanding of the hydrological cycle in the alpine zone quantitative evaluation based on field surveys e g discharge rate and residence time of water as well as an understanding of the geological structure could play important roles 6 conclusions we collected and chemically analyzed runoff water from bare and vegetated catchments in alpine headwaters the effect of vegetation on water storage in alpine zones was discussed using chemical data and component separation results runoff water from bare catchments showed mainly ca no3 type water quality whereas that from vegetated catchments showed na k hco3 type the water quality composition clearly differed between bare and vegetated catchments suggesting that runoff water undergoes different water quality formation processes depending on the presence or absence of vegetation runoff water was collected after precipitation events when the stream levels rose all parameters dissolved ion concentrations ec and ph were higher in the runoff than in the rainwater these results suggested that precipitation contributes to runoff water but leached elements are added due to interaction with the regolith however in a short time period elemental leaching from the regolith was most likely not sufficient to alter the quality of precipitation accordingly we believe that groundwater is discharged and mixed with the precipitation component forming the quality of runoff water we separated runoff water into precipitation and groundwater components using chemical tracers e g mg2 h 2 which reflect information on water that has been affected sufficiently by rock weathering our results indicated that the contribution of groundwater to runoff ranged from 0 3 to 63 8 and was clearly higher in runoff water from vegetated catchments 23 2 22 3 than from bare catchments 2 3 3 8 the relationship between the contribution of the groundwater component and the ratio of vegetated area to bare area in each catchment showed a positive correlation these results suggested that the higher the percentage of vegetation cover the greater would be the groundwater contribution to runoff our finding implies that alpine vegetation not traditionally recognized for its water storage ability could temporarily hold water in the subsurface area it also implies the need to assess the presence of vegetation to understand the hydrological cycle in mountainous areas especially in alpine zones which supply water resources to downstream areas the discussion was deepened regarding the delay between

8537,the physically based spatially distributed hydrometeorological model saser which is based on the surfex lsm is used to model the hydrological cycle in several domains in spain and southern france in this study the modeled streamflows are validated in a domain centered on the pyrenees mountain range and which includes all the surrounding river basins including the ebro and the adour garonne with a spatial resolution of 2 5 km low flows were found to be poorly simulated by the model we present an improvement of the saser modeling chain which introduces a conceptual reservoir to enhance the representation of the slow component drainage in the hydrological response the reservoir introduces two new empirical parameters first the parameters of the conceptual reservoir model were determined on a catchment by catchment basis calibrating against daily observed data from 53 hydrological stations representing near natural conditions local calibration the results show on the median value an improvement δkge of 0 11 with respect to the reference simulation furthermore the relative bias of two low flow indices were calculated and reported a clear improvement secondly a regionalization approach was used which links physiographic information with reservoir parameters through linear equations a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the equation coefficients through the median daily kge cross validation was used to test the regionalization approach the median kge improved from 0 60 default simulation to 0 67 δkge 0 07 after regionalization and execution of the routing scheme and 79 of independent catchments showed improvement the model with regionalized parameters had a performance in kge terms very close to that of the model with locally calibrated parameters the key benefit if the regionalization is that allow us to determine the new empirical parameter of the conceptual reservoir in basins where calibration is not possible ungauged or human influenced basins keywords hydrology land surface model distributed modeling low flows parameter regionalization genetic algorithm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is an essential but limited and variable resource however society is also exposed to hydrological hazards such as floods and droughts which also can be influenced by human activities van loon et al 2016 in this context our societies have adapted to this situation by controlling these variations through the development of hydraulic infrastructure to manage these extremes dams for example allow water storage during the wet or melting in snow dominated areas season to be released during the high demand dry period in some regions of the world e g southern europe and west africa droughts have experienced a trend toward more intense and longer effects in the last decades seneviratne et al 2012 prudhomme et al 2014 zhao dai 2015 additionally climate change and growing water demand exert additional stress on water resources systems bates et al 2008 wanders wada 2015 this highlights the importance of water resources management in areas where water availability is already highly variable and limited at seasonal and annual scales e g the iberian peninsula furthermore it reinforces the necessity to apply methodologies to reproduce more appropriately the hydrological response of the basins especially during low flow periods to provide decision makers with tools to efficiently manage water resources droughts and low flows are characteristics of the natural water cycle van loon 2015 the former are usually defined by a water deficit in relation to a long term average value and depending on which variable presents a deficit drought is categorized in different types mishra singh 2010 meteorological drought related to a precipitation deficit agricultural drought due to a soil moisture deficit and hydrological drought which is related to a low streamflow condition each of them characterized by different indices keyantash dracup 2002 mishra singh 2010 specifically hydrological drought can be defined by the standardized flow index sfi vidal et al 2010 however must not to be confused with low flow conditions which are usual during the dry season every year smakhtin 2001 therefore hydrological drought is a more general phenomenon which is characterized by more factors than by just low flows van loon 2015 droughts have severe impacts on water availability to sustain ecosystem and societal requirements sheffield et al 2012 stahl et al 2016 to study drought impacts and to improve water resource management it is necessary to improve our knowledge of low flows however modeling low flows through hydrological models is still a challenge smakhtin 2001 staudinger et al 2011 land surface models lsms have proven very useful for studying the hydrological cycle including droughts lehner et al 2006 vidal et al 2010 prudhomme et al 2011 van loon et al 2012 mo lettenmaier 2014 xia et al 2014 gaona et al 2022 and seasonal low flows gudmundsson et al 2012 quintana seguí et al 2020 being mostly physically based models they help understand the underlying physical processes however the hydrological response in these models can be potentially improved especially the representation of the slow component of the streamflow which in many cases is constrained by a limited description or even the absence of groundwater modeling stahl et al 2011 gudmundsson et al 2012 among other processes such as lateral subsurface flows low flow periods have not been well represented in large scale models mainly due to a too fast response between precipitation and runoff van loon et al 2012 barella ortiz quintana seguí 2019 quintana seguí et al 2020 this represents a disadvantage in areas where streamflow is dominated by slower processes such as groundwater discharge i e from aquifers mostly during the dry season van loon et al 2012 these limitations are even more important in mountainous areas where groundwater is poorly known somers and mckenzie 2020 therefore it is necessary to improve the simulation of processes that influence the flow s slow component and sustain the summer flows this improvement can be done through i physical groundwater models improved lateral flows etc or by ii conceptual approaches the improvement through physical models is a complex task due to the complexity and the high uncertainties involved also demands good knowledge of the geological structures habets et al 2008 vergnes et al 2012 for example sutanudjaja et al 2011 and tian et al 2012 coupled groundwater models to offline lsm models which do not allow feedback between groundwater storage and soil moisture on the contrary york et al 2002 maxwell miller 2004 and vergnes et al 2012 2020 used coupling schemes where this kind of feedback was considered another physically based approach instead of coupling two models is by modification of the model itself to consider the groundwater effects such as the work done by miguez macho et al 2007 in this case a two way exchange between groundwater and rivers is allowed together with the exchange between the vadose and the saturated zones conceptual approaches use simple mathematical equations to describe hydrologic processes liu et al 2017 it should be stressed that implementing these is not as complex as the options described in the previous paragraph conceptual models depend on parameters to be calibrated which do not correspond to a physical meaning or quantity several studies have tested this approach for example artinyan et al 2008 and getirana et al 2014 added two additional reservoirs to surfex lsm to evaluate the water budget lafaysse et al 2011 added a reservoir to represent the effect of aquifers in mountain areas that was extended in the plain over hard rock aquifer le moigne et al 2020 within the sim safran isba modcou model gascoin et al 2009 implemented an additional storage reservoir to consider the deep groundwater flow in france huang et al 2019 added an additional layer to the dbh distributed biosphere hydrological model to connect the soil layers with a groundwater reservoir guimberteau et al 2014 compared a conceptual soil hydrology scheme against a physical approach using the orchidee organising carbon and hydrology in dynamic ecosystem model over the amazonian basin and reported improvements in the simulated water budget with small differences between them the main objective of this study is to improve low flows simulation in the hydrometeorological model saser safran surfex eaudyssée rapid through the implementation of a well known method a conceptual reservoir conceptual approach which improves the representation of the slow component of the streamflow to this end to determine the values of the new empirical parameters introduced by the reservoir we compare two methods i a catchment by catchment calibration approach local calibration which can only be used in near natural basins where observational data are available and ii a regionalization approach which links the values of the parameters to physiographic and climate variables this second approach allows determining the parameter values of the conceptual reservoir in human influenced basins where observed low flows represent the water management effects of dams which are not simulated instead of the natural processes which are expected to be simulated 2 study area our study area is the pyrenees and all surrounding basins that drain the pyrenees this covers the ebro basin to the south some basins that flow to the bay of biscay to the west the catalan and some languedocian basins to the east and the adour garonne basins to the north the pyrenees are located on the isthmus of the iberian peninsula between the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea with a length of more than 400 km in the e w direction and a maximum width of 150 km in its central part the topography of the study area is very heterogeneous as it includes the pyrenees mountain range which reaches over 3000 m at the highest points and flat areas of the surrounding valleys such as the ebro valley the climate is predominantly influenced by mediterranean features in its eastern side and atlantic influences in its western side with an alpine climate in the highest areas furthermore the topography results in large spatial precipitation and temperature variability in the adour garonne river basin the southeastern part is dominated by the mediterranean climate whereas the western part is influenced by atlantic ocean conditions precipitation varies on average from 600 mm in the middle part of the basin to 2000 mm in the south part and atlantic coast the precipitation decreases with both the topography and the distance to the atlantic seasonally precipitation has two maxima one in winter and a second in spring similarly on the spanish side of the pyrenees precipitation decreases from west to east and from north to south annual precipitation varies from 100 mm in the central ebro valley to more than 2000 mm in the highest areas the precipitation regime is characterized by high interannual variability lópez justribó 2010 particularly in mediterranean areas most of the annual precipitation occurs during spring and autumn although in some regions the maximum precipitation occurs during the cold season in the atlantic areas in the pyrenees and in the central ebro valley the summers are mainly dry lópez moreno et al 2008 2011 the pyrenees considered as natural water towers for its surrounding basins provide the water that satisfies the downstream demands for human and environmental needs immerzeel et al 2019 the main water uses in the adour garonne basin are agricultural and industrial in the ebro water demands by the agricultural sector represent 92 of the total water volume of the basin this being the main water use in the basin http www chebro es guest uso del agua this agricultural development was made possible by the construction of several dams that regulate the river flows and store water for dry periods the large number of dams has caused major alterations in river regimes and reduced the magnitude of floods nevertheless low flows were also affected being reduced by an order of magnitude which is undesirable for ecological purposes environmental flows batalla et al 2004 additionally the ever expanding human activity mainly irrigation has increased the pressure on the water resources of the basin 3 data and models in this section we describe the observational streamflow database used it together with the model and physiographic database 3 1 streamflow data the observational streamflow database used was gathered by the efa210 16 piragua project zabaleta et al 2022 it consists of daily streamflow records from the different river basin authorities that manage the water in the study area for our analysis we considered a final database comprising 392 gauging stations that encompasses the temporal period between september 1979 and august 2014 35 years of these 104 were selected as natural and near natural gauging stations analyzing the data and metadata as indicate the fig 1 a with black circles the selection was carried out following the criteria below 1 only stations with at least 20 years of data within the analysis period were considered 2 data gaps of less than 10 of the total record length these gaps were not filled were allowed 3 flows must have a natural or near natural hydrological regime i e the stations must not be downstream of important human influenced areas e g reservoirs irrigation areas for calibration purposes from the selection of natural stations previously done we selected outlet stations with series starting in 1979 and with at least 30 years of records fig 1b shows the final selection which resulted in 31 outlet stations in total 53 sub catchments if we consider the nested catchments 3 2 description of saser model saser safran surfex eaudysee rapid is a distributed and physically based modeling chain consisting of a meteorological forcing a lsm and a routing scheme système d analyse fournissant des renseignements atmosphériques à la neige safran durand et al 1993 is a meteorological analysis system that produces the meteorological gridded forcing dataset using an optimal interpolation algorithm which exploits the output of a meteorological model as first guess and in situ observations safran provides hourly meteorological data which is then ingested by the lsm the safran dataset used here is piragua atmos analysis quintana seguí le cointe 2022 which was created within the efa210 16 piragua project and corresponds to a union of the french quintana seguí et al 2008 vidal et al 2010 and the spanish quintana seguí et al 2016 2017 implementations of safran it has a temporal resolution of one hour and a spatial resolution of 2 5 km the lsm used by saser is surfex surface externalisée in french masson et al 2013 version 8 1 it uses the interaction soil biospère atmosphère isba scheme habets et al 2008 to simulate natural surfaces which describes the vertical processes in the soil column and generates a runoff and a drainage that flows through the hydrosystem using eaudysée saleh et al 2011 vergnes habets 2018 and the routing application for parallel computation of discharge rapid scheme david et al 2011 we used the surfex simulations of the piragua hydro analysis dataset beguería et al 2022 which were performed using the same grid as the piragua atmos analysis eaudysée and rapid were run at a resolution of 1 km using the hydrosheds database lehner grill 2013 to describe the stream network some limitations of the current saser implementations are that i there is no lateral flow between surfex grid cells ii there is no bidirectional interaction between the river and the alluvial aquifer and iii groundwater processes are not simulated this translates into a fast reaction between runoff and precipitation therefore a better representation of groundwater storage is necessary to account for the slow processes groundwater and snow melting 3 3 physiography in this study we used the surfex s default physiographic database ecoclimap ii faroux et al 2013 it has a spatial resolution of 1 km and includes an ecosystem classification as well as a consistent set of land surface parameters in contrast to commonly used land cover products like corine land cover and global land cover ecoclimap ii has a new division of the existing classes with a better regional character obtained from the climatic environment latitude proximity to the sea topography the land cover parameters provided in this dataset include root depth minimal stomatal resistance albedo and leaf area index lai the temporal variables are represented using a climatology i e a mean annual cycle additionally we used the copernicus ndvi product which was obtained from https land copernicus eu global products ndvi last access 2022 06 07 3 4 simpa model reference simpa integrated precipitation streamflow modelling system in its original acronym in spanish is a conceptual and semi distributed hydrological model developed in the centre for public works studies and experimentation cedex in spain estrela quintas 1996 simpa simulates the natural water balance and provides information about the main hydrological variables precipitation evapotranspiration streamflow at a monthly time step simpa is used by the spanish authorities for water resources evaluation 4 methods this section presents a detailed description of the methods implemented to improve low flow simulation fig 2 shows the schematic flowchart with the steps of the two methodologies used that are described below 4 1 conceptual reservoir the implementation of a conceptual reservoir is based on the formulation from rainfall runoff models like arno todini 1996 or topmodel beven kirkby 1979 the major difference being that the reservoir here presented is implemented as an external module in the lsm model as a postprocessing of the drainage to account for a better representation of slow component of simulated streamflow we introduced a conceptual reservoir at grid point level to improve the slow component of the streamflow we did not modify the partitioning between surface runoff and drainage done by surfex lsm the reservoir purpose is to modulate the drainage simulated by surfex to sustaining it during the dry period before being fed to the river routing component eaudysée rapid fig 3 moreover surface runoff is not modified to avoid an excessive role of empirical parameters on the hydrological response of the model the input to the reservoir is the drainage generated by surfex the reservoir has two outflows the first mimics a baseflow and is the main contributing term sustaining flow during the dry period the second occurs when the reservoir exceeds the maximum threshold so there is no time lag when drainage is simulated during the wet season when the reservoir is full the total reservoir outflow is calculated following equations 1 to 3 1 l i τ d i 1 τ k l i 1 q ov 2 q di k l i 1 q ov and 3 q ov m a x 0 l i 1 l m a x τ where di mm day 1 is the drainage li mm the water content of the reservoir k day 1 and lmax mm are empirical parameters which correspond to the depletion coefficient and the size of the reservoir respectively qdi mm day 1 is the total reservoir outflow qov mm day 1 is the reservoir outflow and τ is a constant with a value of 1 day the subindices i and i 1 represent the current time step and the previous step respectively finally qdi is added to surfex s runoff and sent to eaudysée rapid to compute daily streamflow 4 2 model performance evaluation in different steps calibration validation and regionalization we need to evaluate the performance of the simulations we chose the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 as our objective function 4 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the pearson s correlation coefficient α is the bias component and β represent the ratio of discharge variance 5 α m s m o a n d β σ s σ o m and σ represent the mean and standard deviation respectively similarly subscripts s and o represent simulated and observed discharge respectively the kge over untransformed discharge puts more weight on high flows garcia et al 2017 and since our analysis is focused on low flows we used a root square transformation kge q1 2 which allows balancing the weight on low and high flow without losing the physical meaning santos et al 2018 for performance metrics is important have a benchmark to determine when the model performance is strength or not clark et al 2021 the more traditional nash suttclife nse criterion nash sutcliffe 1970 uses the average of the observations as a benchmark this means that nse 0 if the model performed better than the benchmark knoben et al 2019 demonstrated that using the same reasoning nse 0 in the kge criteria is not consistent they showed that kge values greater than 0 41 indicate an improvement over the mean flow benchmark therefore we used a kge value of 0 41 as the baseline value only within the context of the genetic algorithm which must evaluate the goodness of fit of each member of the population at each step we used a transformation of the kge 6 kg e b kge 2 k g e this transformation avoids the skewed distribution of efficiencies for large samples mathevet et al 2006 4 3 reservoir parameter calibration procedure the size of the reservoir lmax and the depletion coefficient k have to be calibrated for calibration and validation we use a classical split sample procedure therefore we split the entire record into two halves the calibration period spans from 01 09 1979 to 31 08 1997 and the validation period from 01 09 1997 to 31 08 2014 both parameters were calibrated at the sub catchment scale on a catchment by catchment basis against locally observed streamflow data which involves that all the grid points belonging to the sub catchment had the same values of the parameters hereafter we will refer to this step as local calibration the grid resolution and the distribution of hydrological stations allowed us to use a nested approach to calibrate the parameters where streamflow data were available thus the parameters were calibrated first on the upstream sub catchments and then progressively towards the outlet we set the valid range for both parameters using similar criteria defined by artinyan et al 2008 the accumulated streamflow of the dry period from july to september should be close to the average reservoir level lmax parameter for each sub catchment we obtained the total runoff volume for the dry period of the driest year of the calibration period qdry in mm and lmax was estimated as 12qdry lmax qdry according to artinyan et al 2008 twelve times the volume of the driest months seems a reasonable upper bound for this parameter the limits of the depletion coefficient k were calculated considering the length of the dry period thus the reservoir has drainage releases during the length of the dry period we create a parameter space for simulations purposes where the range between the extreme values of each parameter was discretized into 12 values a total of 144 simulations were carried out and the performance of each simulation was evaluated for each sub catchment using the kge q1 2 see section 4 2 the best simulation for each sub catchment was chosen and the parameter set associated with each of them was saved 4 4 regionalization of the parameters when observational data are not available or they do not have good quality or they include processes that are not simulated such as human processes dams and irrigation local calibration is unfeasible to overcome this limitation we used the regionalization approach presented by beck et al 2020 which allows setting the values of the reservoir parameters all over the domain going beyond the near natural basins used in the calibration procedure 4 4 1 predictors used for the regionalization for the regionalization approach we selected eight physiographic variables as predictors three of them were related to climate ari aridity index map mean annual precipitation and pet potential evaporation beck et al 2016 nijssen et al 2001 singh et al 2014 and troch et al 2013 demonstrated that these variables exert an important influence on the flow response in regionalization studies at global scale the map predictor was transformed to square root to better fit a normal distribution the ndvi normalized difference vegetation index and snw fraction of snow with respect to the total precipitation are predictors related to land cover the ndvi was added because the vegetation influences in the evaporation infiltration and hydrological function of the soil which may also affect the slow component low flows and runoff rainfall conversion processes zhang et al 2001 donohue et al 2007 peel 2009 the snow affects the land cover and has an important role in streamflow generation in mountain regions and also on the slow component of the flow finally sl the slope snd soil sand content and cly soil clay content are variables related to the topography and the soil the slope predictor was included due to the good general correlation between surface slope and soil depth tesfa et al 2009 and the soil texture has a strong influence on all soil related processes including subsurface runoff price 2011 most of these variables were obtained from the ecoclimap ii database although these descriptors are not directly associated with groundwater they help determine a landscape that can be prone or not to groundwater 4 4 2 regionalization approach the regionalization approach uses a genetic algorithm to optimize the coefficients of the transfer equations these equations link the reservoir parameters predictands to the physiographic variables predictors we use the same near natural basis that in the local calibration all of them have an area smaller than 5 000 km2 for the optimization the reservoir scheme was run at daily time step and at same surfex spatial resolution for the whole period 1979 2014 the surfex runoff and reservoir output were spatially aggregated and compared with observed runoff this comparison is possible due to the size of the catchments that allows us to discard channel routing effects gericke smithers 2014 the methodology is shown in fig 2 right panel and a detailed description is presented below since the reservoir is implemented as an external module to postprocess the surfex drainage before the routing step there is no need to run surfex within the genetic algorithm see fig 3 this is a key benefit as surfex is a computationally expensive model furthermore given the size of the catchments there is no need to run the routing scheme eaudyssee rapid at each iteration see fig 4 this allows us to undertake a very high number of simulations as we only run the very simple reservoir model which consists of a few lines of python code the transfer equations that link the predictors with the predictands are expressed as follows 7 m p i w i 1 a r i w i 2 m a p w i 3 p e t w i 4 n d v i w i 5 s n w w i 6 s l w i 7 s n d w i 8 c l y w i 9 where mpi are the model parameters k and l max and wi are the coefficients that will be optimized the eight predictors chosen are see the previous section ari aridity index p pet map mean annual precipitation root square transformed pet mean annual potential evaporation ndvi mean normalized difference vegetation index snw the fraction of snow with respect to the total precipitation sl topographic slope snd soil sand content and cly soil clay content first each predictor was interpolated to the same grid as the model uses 2 5 km of resolution next as beck et al 2020 did predictor values were clipped using the 99th and 1st percentiles of the area covered by the sub catchments finally to make the predictors comparable to each other they were standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing the results by the standard deviation of the area covered by the sub catchments the coefficients of the transfer equations 9 2 18 wi were optimized using our own implementation of the μ λ genetic algorithm slowik kwasnicka 2020 the μ λ algorithm indicates that selected parents and children together comprise the new population offspring for the next iteration the algorithm starts with a random population λ of 32 members all of them are evaluated using the performance score kgeb and the best three members are selected and saved for the next iteration μ size of the parents in the population subsequently through the mutation operator the offspring is created λ μ children are randomly created from each selected parent following a normal distribution within the search space a maximum number of 100 iterations was set fig 4 represents the main steps in the optimization process first predictor maps are obtained depending on the area covered by the catchments used second the parameter maps are calculated using transfer equations to subsequently apply the reservoir scheme this scheme is run using as input the daily drainage simulated by surfex the reservoir output modulated drainage and the surfex runoff are spatially aggregated all cells that comprise each catchment and compared to observed streamflow of each catchment using the kge score to avoid overfitting and to have an indicator of uncertainty in the parameter sets cross validation was used for this the catchment set was subdivided into training 87 and validation 13 subsets this selection was performed randomly the catchments used for validation were used only once in each iteration performing different experiments until all of them were used in the validation in total 8 experiments were run each experiment consists of a training subset 27 catchments and 4 randomly selected catchments for independent validation in this sense the validation subset in each experiment is different because each catchment was used only once 4 5 low flow indices in addition to calculating the kge scores and to evaluate how the conceptual reservoir implementation local calibration and regionalization approach impacted the simulated low flows we calculate two low flow indices different low flow indices can be estimated gustard et al 1992 smakhtin 2001 but we focused on two common ones first the ratio q90 q50 where q50 is the median and the q90 is the low value that is observed 1 10th of the time at daily time step this index is interpreted as the proportion of streamflow originating from groundwater stores excluding the effects of the catchment area smakhtin 2001 second the annual minimum monthly flow with a return period of 5 years qmna 5 which is widely used in france for water management issues and provides information about low flow severity to compute the qmna 5 we calculated the 5 year return period for each sub catchment fitting it to a log normal distribution for low flows catalogne 2012 based on a series with at least 30 years of record we derived the low flows indices for the summer period july to september for each station and computed both using the observations and the simulations then we calculated the relative bias to evaluate and compare the performance of the simulations 5 results 5 1 model performance of default saser simulation to evaluate the performance of the saser model default simulation we calculated the kge q1 2 and used the 104 stations defined as natural or near natural which are indicated by circles with black border in fig 5 fig 5 shows the calculated kge scores for the entire period 1979 2014 stations with the highest kge values are located mainly in the pyrenean region where direct human influence is low however most of the stations in the ebro river basin a highly influenced basin showed lower kge values especially in areas downstream of the reservoirs this was expected since the model must perform poorly over human influenced areas as it only simulates natural processes if we focus on the near natural basins fig 1a we see that 11 of 104 stations uncolored circles in fig 4 show kge values below the baseline value of 0 41 these lower values belong to stations located at a closer junction of small tributaries with the main channel same saser pixel and due to resolution constraints 2 5 km saser takes the simulated streamflow to the main channel and not from the tributary for the rest of the stations 17 and 42 showed values greater than 0 7 and 0 5 respectively in fig 6 we compare the observed obs in beige and simulated default in red statistics of the streamflow for the different percentiles near natural basins and the 53 catchments where the reservoir was calibrated the saser model default simulates reasonably well high and median daily streamflow represented by the 90th to 99th percentiles and 50th to 75th percentiles respectively however low flows 25th percentile and below are underestimated as depicted in the red boxes in fig 6 for example the median relative bias between observed discharge and default simulation for the 25th percentile is 66 whereas for the 95th percentile is 12 this shows that low flows are poorly simulated by the default saser model 5 2 evaluation of the model including the reservoir with calibrated parameters fig 7 shows the result of the calibration of the two model parameters lmax and k in the near natural basins they were calibrated empirically by running the reservoir scheme the values of the lmax parameter ranged from a minimum of 4 mm to a maximum of 600 mm with an average value of 108 mm while the values of parameter k ranged from 0 01 to 0 04 with a median value of 0 018 at the end of the calibration process we observed the following results most ebro catchments have the same value of parameter k 0 02 whereas the parameter lmax varies over a wider range of values these parameter values are explained by basin characteristics such as soil type topography etc for example higher lmax values correspond to sub catchments with high permeability e g south of france detailed information is presented in discussion section fig 8 summarizes the resulting kge scores and shows that adding a calibrated conceptual reservoir improves them over all catchments on the one hand panel a shows that for the calibration period the median kge value of the default simulation was 0 63 and using the reservoir scheme it was 0 72 which represents a clear improvement with respect to the default simulation for the validation period panel b the default simulation has a score of 0 60 and the calibrated one of 0 71 which is a similar improvement than that from the calibration period panel c compares the difference between the scores of the calibrated model with the reservoir obtained during the calibration and validation periods the two lines are very close which is an indicator of robustness the model performs similarly inside and outside the calibration period the resulting time series fig 9 shows graphically that the calibrated reservoir produces time series closer to the observations the kge values where higher for the simulation using the reservoir scheme for both periods panels a and b of fig 9 show the time series of the daily streamflow at two stations only two years of the calibration period are depicted in order to make the plots easy to read and panels c and d show the same stations for the validation period the improved model is able to sustain the summer flows much better than the default model without affecting the median and high flows the blue boxes in fig 6 clearly show that the lower percentiles of the simulation with the calibrated reservoir are improved compared to the default simulation for the three percentiles related to low flows the 5th 10th and 25th the values of median relative bias for default simulation were 90 84 and 66 respectively whereas the values obtained from the simulation with reservoir scheme were 37 33 and 17 for the same percentiles even though the values remain slightly underestimated it represents an improvement in low flow simulation 5 3 evaluation of the regionalization approach as an example fig 10 shows the evolution of the kge and the kgeb for one of the experiments we recall that the kge and kgeb are related through equation 6 each point represents the model performance after each iteration of the genetic algorithm while it searches for the best solution for this experiment during the first iterations the kge rapidly increases and after iteration 30 the slope of the curve changes drastically to be almost flat which indicates that the algorithm is close to a maximum in this case the median kge is slightly higher than 0 53 as the new mutations do not improve the result and are not selected similar behavior was founded in all the experiments fig 11 shows the boxplots of the resulting kge for the independent catchments of each experiment and compares it with the kge obtained from the default and local calibration experiments the median daily kge value of the default simulation was 0 41 and the median daily kge value of the local calibration was 0 53 while for the regionalization it was 0 52 its value is close to the obtained by the local calibration furthermore we obtained improvements in 79 of the validation catchments this confirms the robustness of the regionalization approach to improve low flows in the catchments that were not used in the training dataset also the kge scores are as good as using the local calibration fig 12 shows the distribution of the kge values for the different experiments starting from the left the graph shows i the default simulation brown ii the local calibration dark blue which represents a clear improvement iii the eight different regionalization experiments light green and iv three additional experiments light brown the eight regionalization experiments show median kge values very close to each other around 0 51 in fig 12 the 75th percentile top edge of each box of all experiments shows a similar value close to 0 6 while the minimum values lower whiskers show greater variability suggesting that catchments for which the kge score was poor are more sensitive the three additional experiments last three boxes in fig 12 where performed to see how the eight experiments can be combined to obtain a final result in the first additional experiment we calculate the median time series of the eight previous experiments in the second we run the reservoir scheme with the median value of the k and lmax parameter maps median value of the parameters for each grid point and calculate streamflow in the last experiment we calculated the median value of each parameter 57 mm and 0 016 for lmax and k respectively and run the reservoir scheme with these homogeneous values over the entire domain surprisingly these three extra experiments showed a similar kge median values when we compare to previous experiments however the last experiment fixed median values showed a slightly larger spread among kge values in any case in the local calibration or regionalization approach kge values are not below 0 41 the benchmark defined previously an example of one year of observed and simulated by aggregating runoff and drainage daily streamflow for one catchment is given in fig 13 in this plot we computed the median flow of the eight regionalization experiments dark blue line and we also plotted in light blue the confidence interval of the simulations 5 4 computing natural streamflow with the improved model once the maps of the two parameters of the reservoir model were obtained using the median value of the parameter maps of the eight experiments fig a1 we proceed to calculate the final streamflow using the river routing scheme fig 14 presents the streamflow simulation performance obtained using the median values of the eight regionalization experiments for the entire record 1979 2014 over the complete database of the total stations 47 showed higher kge values than 0 5 5 more compared to the default simulation fig 14 b shows the improvement in terms of δkge due to regionalization for the whole period for comparison purposes we calculated the kge values over the same periods that were used for local the local calibration 1979 1997 and validation 1997 2014 for the first period calibration the regionalization approach obtains a median kge of 0 69 and for the second one validation it was 0 67 which is very close fig 15 summarizes the performance of local calibration and regionalization approach over the calibration solid lines and validation validation lines periods on the near natural basins both approaches showed an improvement compared to the default simulation without the reservoir the best kge values are provided by the local calibration which we expected even though the regionalization approach showed very close values to local calibration the advantage of the regionalization approach is that it allows us to estimate the values of the parameters anywhere in the area of study thus we can also calculate improved natural flows on influenced basins where local calibration would be impossible 5 4 1 comparison with a reference model as the observations are affected by water management we compare our results with an independent model in this case we use the simpa model which is used by water managers in the ebro river basin we extracted the time series simulated by the default and the improved model on the outlet of the ebro river basin located in tortosa we computed the mean annual cycle of streamflow for the period 1980 to 2006 at the monthly time step and plotted it fig 16 together with the observations in black and the simpa model in green the default simulation in red presents the lowest flows during the summer from july to september as expected whereas the peak flow occurs in january in general the hydrograph of the default simulation has a shape similar to that of the observations but with a positive bias the positive bias is expected as in the real basin there is more evapotranspiration due to irrigation than in the naturalized one in contrast the simpa model gray line shows two peaks one in december and the other in april and the minimum streamflow corresponds to the summer months but with values twice higher than the observations the flows obtained with the improved model setting the parameters with the regionalization approach green line show a clear increase of low flows but they are still very low compared to simpa it is notable that the improved model reduces the january peak but increases the streamflow of the following months february and march the new hydrograph presents a double peak which is what we expected and what can be seen in simpa it is notable how the reservoir modifies the streamflow of the winter months this could not be seen in the daily hydrographs we showed in fig 13 but this arises clearly in the monthly annual cycle of the outlet which aggregates the changes throughout the basin nevertheless is difficult to determine which model is closer to reality because the observations represent the real basin not the naturalized one as the models do 5 5 low flow indices evaluation in fig 17 we can see the improvements in the low flow indices for the q90 q50 ratio left panel of fig 17 the default simulation without reservoir showed a median relative bias of 80 with respect to observations whereas the median relative bias of the simulation adding a reservoir was of 32 in both cases this index is underestimated but there is a significant gain due to the reservoir implementation on the other hand the qmna 5 right panel of fig 17 also showed an improvement in median relative bias from 64 of the default simulations to 20 of the simulation adding a reservoir in the case of regionalization approach green boxes in fig 17 low flow indices reported values of median relative bias of 26 and 22 for the q90 q50 ratio and qmna 5 respectively these values are practically same to the local calibration only the 75th percentile top edge of the box for the q90 q50 shows a larger difference in any case although low flow indices still remain underestimated the inclusion and calibration of a reservoir using either approach noticeably improves the simulated values of the low flow indices and the regionalization approach behaves very well compared to the local calibration one 6 discussion we used a conceptual approach based on rainfall runoff models to improve the streamflow simulated by saser adding a reservoir at the grid scale resolution this is intended to provide a better representation of the slow component in the hydrological response which is not well simulated by surfex results show that the additional reservoir which is simple and easy to calibrate has a very positive impact on the streamflow simulation however the calibration of the reservoir parameters is only possible in gauged natural basins which are not numerous in the area of study the implementation of the conceptual reservoir has as its main objective to sustain the flows without having a significant impact on the daily high and medium flows surface runoff for this reason the reservoir scheme is implemented as a postprocessing of just the drainage which is the slow component this redistribution of the water volume does not affect the shape of the hydrograph during peak events during the summer months there is a significant improvement in the low flow simulation as shown in fig 16 this fact supports the effectiveness of the reservoir to improve the streamflow simulation at the same time at the monthly step we see that the annual cycle has changed considerably redistributing water from winter to summer and obtaining a more realistic double peaked hydrograph at the outlet of the ebro basin a regionalization approach was established to find the values of the parameters for all the grid points of the area of study not only those located in near natural basins this approach uses physiographic and climate related predictors although these variables are not immediately associated with groundwater they exert an indirect influence on the runoff response therefore those predictors are acting as proxies for defining the predictands moreover several previous regionalization studies have emphasized the use of those predictors nijssen et al 2001 singh et al 2014 beck et al 2016 2020 the performance of the model with regionalized parameters is almost as good as that of the catchment by catchment local calibration approach as reported kge values in the local calibration approach the values of the parameters are lumped which probably would not work well in larger basins thus the regionalization approach would probably be more advantaged if tested in larger basins additionally having lumped values of the parameters per basin does not play well with a model that is mostly physical and which tries to be as spatially distributed as possible the regionalization approach allows us to apply the reservoir everywhere in the study domain even in heavily human influenced areas where a local calibration approach is not feasible due to the lack of validation data we have compared our simulation with a reference one simpa the results from such an experiment are less easily interpretable still least it makes it evident that the differences are lower now even if they remain very large when compare with the reference model the maps of the reservoir parameters produced by the regionalization approach are presented in fig a1 these maps cover the full domain at 2 5 km resolution and vary according to climate and physiographic information that we used as predictors it is difficult to explain the spatial patterns due to the complex and strong connection between the different variables e g climate vegetation and soil properties involved troch et al 2013 despite we can identify spatial patterns related to known hydrological processes at least in one of the parameter maps l reservoir size patterns in this parameter associated to soil moisture content can be explained by the land cover precipitation and soil granulometric distribution for example in the region of the south west of france where large sand deposits exist landes the runoff response is quick and infiltration has high rates thus a buffer is required to play the role of groundwater storage and sustain the flows during the dry season and hence the values of the reservoir size are expected to be larger than in clay predominated regions on the other hand the patterns in the map of the k parameter are not easily interpreted both soil properties and topography influence the distribution of water storage and isolating the influence of each other is problematic price 2011 different regionalization experiments were carried out to account the equifinality problem multiple optimal solutions providing reasonably similar or equal model performance values which is one of the most important sources of uncertainty in hydrological modeling beven freer 2001 furthermore in each experiment cross validation process was used that allows us to estimate the generalizability of the parameters and provides an indication of uncertainty previous experiments done not showed here indicated that the parameters used to initialize the genetic algorithm have a strong influence over the search direction and efficiency score as shown in fig 13 light blue bands time series of simulated daily streamflow provide in general a wide range of streamflow uncertainty bands derived from the parameter sets especially at the end of the wet season and gradually decreasing during the dry season july to august otherwise the uncertainty bands during the winter months were of much lesser extent except in some months november and december this could be explained by the fact that the reservoir configuration focuses only on low flows however an extensive parameter uncertainty assessment is beyond the scope of this study in addition to kge scores and to understand how well the additional reservoir simulates low flows which is the main objective of the study we evaluated the q90 q50 and the qmna 5 indices the negative relative bias in both indices of default simulation suggests a fast precipitation to runoff reaction of the saser model hence the low flows are underestimated during the dry periods results of our different simulations local calibration or regionalization approach adding the reservoir showed a considerable improvement in both indices although they are still slightly underestimated suggesting the suitability of the conceptual reservoir to improve the simulation of the slow component of the streamflow even though other aspects of the model still need to be improved a key result of this work is that introducing a conceptual reservoir in the saser model is useful even if we cannot easily calibrate the parameters in each catchment provided that values of the parameters are reasonable this was demonstrated by different simulations eight experiments and the three extra experiments using lumped parameters carried out even if it is difficult to know which the most appropriated parameter maps is at least we know that all of them produce reasonable results and that all of them are considerably better than the simulation without the reservoir default 7 conclusions the main objective of this study is to improve the simulation of low streamflow in the hydrometeorological model saser by using a simple conceptual reservoir scheme to postprocess the drainage and thus improve the slow component of the streamflow the saser simulations were made over a period of 35 years in an area that covers the pyrenees and surrounding basins the default saser model presents a strong negative bias of low flow indices the addition of a reservoir scheme to modulate the drainage had a positive result in terms of kge values when the parameters were set using a local calibration method both for the calibration and validation periods the addition of a conceptual reservoir proved to be a simple and efficient option with a limited number of parameters which improves the low flows simulated by surfex without deteriorating high flows as shown in the improvement of the low flow indices studied qmna 5 and q90 q5 0 a regionalization approach based on a genetic algorithm was introduced to determine the values of the parameters all over the domain including basins heavily influenced by water management where a standard local calibration of these parameters is not possible results of the regionalization approach showed a clear general improvement of simulated streamflow δkge 0 11 with an improvement for 79 of the validation catchments those results were almost as good as using local calibration both kge scores and the two low flow indices indicate improvements especially for the low flow indices although a small negative bias of the low flow indices remains the regionalization approach based on a genetic algorithm was possible due to the simplicity of the conceptual model and its implementation as an external module of surfex applying this approach to calibrate other empirical parameters within the surfex model itself would be desirable but impractical due to computational constrains we established a relationship between the parameters of the conceptual reservoir with climate and physiographic variables through the genetic algorithm which allows us to take into account the within catchment variability all over the study area although this approach is not physically based it allows linking the two new parameters with variables that are physical which is a good compromise for a model that tries to be distributed and as physical as possible in conclusion the addition of a conceptual reservoir to postprocess the saser simulated drainage led to considerable improvement in low flow simulation the regionalization approach allows us to apply the reservoir all over the domain including the human influenced basins

8537,the physically based spatially distributed hydrometeorological model saser which is based on the surfex lsm is used to model the hydrological cycle in several domains in spain and southern france in this study the modeled streamflows are validated in a domain centered on the pyrenees mountain range and which includes all the surrounding river basins including the ebro and the adour garonne with a spatial resolution of 2 5 km low flows were found to be poorly simulated by the model we present an improvement of the saser modeling chain which introduces a conceptual reservoir to enhance the representation of the slow component drainage in the hydrological response the reservoir introduces two new empirical parameters first the parameters of the conceptual reservoir model were determined on a catchment by catchment basis calibrating against daily observed data from 53 hydrological stations representing near natural conditions local calibration the results show on the median value an improvement δkge of 0 11 with respect to the reference simulation furthermore the relative bias of two low flow indices were calculated and reported a clear improvement secondly a regionalization approach was used which links physiographic information with reservoir parameters through linear equations a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the equation coefficients through the median daily kge cross validation was used to test the regionalization approach the median kge improved from 0 60 default simulation to 0 67 δkge 0 07 after regionalization and execution of the routing scheme and 79 of independent catchments showed improvement the model with regionalized parameters had a performance in kge terms very close to that of the model with locally calibrated parameters the key benefit if the regionalization is that allow us to determine the new empirical parameter of the conceptual reservoir in basins where calibration is not possible ungauged or human influenced basins keywords hydrology land surface model distributed modeling low flows parameter regionalization genetic algorithm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is an essential but limited and variable resource however society is also exposed to hydrological hazards such as floods and droughts which also can be influenced by human activities van loon et al 2016 in this context our societies have adapted to this situation by controlling these variations through the development of hydraulic infrastructure to manage these extremes dams for example allow water storage during the wet or melting in snow dominated areas season to be released during the high demand dry period in some regions of the world e g southern europe and west africa droughts have experienced a trend toward more intense and longer effects in the last decades seneviratne et al 2012 prudhomme et al 2014 zhao dai 2015 additionally climate change and growing water demand exert additional stress on water resources systems bates et al 2008 wanders wada 2015 this highlights the importance of water resources management in areas where water availability is already highly variable and limited at seasonal and annual scales e g the iberian peninsula furthermore it reinforces the necessity to apply methodologies to reproduce more appropriately the hydrological response of the basins especially during low flow periods to provide decision makers with tools to efficiently manage water resources droughts and low flows are characteristics of the natural water cycle van loon 2015 the former are usually defined by a water deficit in relation to a long term average value and depending on which variable presents a deficit drought is categorized in different types mishra singh 2010 meteorological drought related to a precipitation deficit agricultural drought due to a soil moisture deficit and hydrological drought which is related to a low streamflow condition each of them characterized by different indices keyantash dracup 2002 mishra singh 2010 specifically hydrological drought can be defined by the standardized flow index sfi vidal et al 2010 however must not to be confused with low flow conditions which are usual during the dry season every year smakhtin 2001 therefore hydrological drought is a more general phenomenon which is characterized by more factors than by just low flows van loon 2015 droughts have severe impacts on water availability to sustain ecosystem and societal requirements sheffield et al 2012 stahl et al 2016 to study drought impacts and to improve water resource management it is necessary to improve our knowledge of low flows however modeling low flows through hydrological models is still a challenge smakhtin 2001 staudinger et al 2011 land surface models lsms have proven very useful for studying the hydrological cycle including droughts lehner et al 2006 vidal et al 2010 prudhomme et al 2011 van loon et al 2012 mo lettenmaier 2014 xia et al 2014 gaona et al 2022 and seasonal low flows gudmundsson et al 2012 quintana seguí et al 2020 being mostly physically based models they help understand the underlying physical processes however the hydrological response in these models can be potentially improved especially the representation of the slow component of the streamflow which in many cases is constrained by a limited description or even the absence of groundwater modeling stahl et al 2011 gudmundsson et al 2012 among other processes such as lateral subsurface flows low flow periods have not been well represented in large scale models mainly due to a too fast response between precipitation and runoff van loon et al 2012 barella ortiz quintana seguí 2019 quintana seguí et al 2020 this represents a disadvantage in areas where streamflow is dominated by slower processes such as groundwater discharge i e from aquifers mostly during the dry season van loon et al 2012 these limitations are even more important in mountainous areas where groundwater is poorly known somers and mckenzie 2020 therefore it is necessary to improve the simulation of processes that influence the flow s slow component and sustain the summer flows this improvement can be done through i physical groundwater models improved lateral flows etc or by ii conceptual approaches the improvement through physical models is a complex task due to the complexity and the high uncertainties involved also demands good knowledge of the geological structures habets et al 2008 vergnes et al 2012 for example sutanudjaja et al 2011 and tian et al 2012 coupled groundwater models to offline lsm models which do not allow feedback between groundwater storage and soil moisture on the contrary york et al 2002 maxwell miller 2004 and vergnes et al 2012 2020 used coupling schemes where this kind of feedback was considered another physically based approach instead of coupling two models is by modification of the model itself to consider the groundwater effects such as the work done by miguez macho et al 2007 in this case a two way exchange between groundwater and rivers is allowed together with the exchange between the vadose and the saturated zones conceptual approaches use simple mathematical equations to describe hydrologic processes liu et al 2017 it should be stressed that implementing these is not as complex as the options described in the previous paragraph conceptual models depend on parameters to be calibrated which do not correspond to a physical meaning or quantity several studies have tested this approach for example artinyan et al 2008 and getirana et al 2014 added two additional reservoirs to surfex lsm to evaluate the water budget lafaysse et al 2011 added a reservoir to represent the effect of aquifers in mountain areas that was extended in the plain over hard rock aquifer le moigne et al 2020 within the sim safran isba modcou model gascoin et al 2009 implemented an additional storage reservoir to consider the deep groundwater flow in france huang et al 2019 added an additional layer to the dbh distributed biosphere hydrological model to connect the soil layers with a groundwater reservoir guimberteau et al 2014 compared a conceptual soil hydrology scheme against a physical approach using the orchidee organising carbon and hydrology in dynamic ecosystem model over the amazonian basin and reported improvements in the simulated water budget with small differences between them the main objective of this study is to improve low flows simulation in the hydrometeorological model saser safran surfex eaudyssée rapid through the implementation of a well known method a conceptual reservoir conceptual approach which improves the representation of the slow component of the streamflow to this end to determine the values of the new empirical parameters introduced by the reservoir we compare two methods i a catchment by catchment calibration approach local calibration which can only be used in near natural basins where observational data are available and ii a regionalization approach which links the values of the parameters to physiographic and climate variables this second approach allows determining the parameter values of the conceptual reservoir in human influenced basins where observed low flows represent the water management effects of dams which are not simulated instead of the natural processes which are expected to be simulated 2 study area our study area is the pyrenees and all surrounding basins that drain the pyrenees this covers the ebro basin to the south some basins that flow to the bay of biscay to the west the catalan and some languedocian basins to the east and the adour garonne basins to the north the pyrenees are located on the isthmus of the iberian peninsula between the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea with a length of more than 400 km in the e w direction and a maximum width of 150 km in its central part the topography of the study area is very heterogeneous as it includes the pyrenees mountain range which reaches over 3000 m at the highest points and flat areas of the surrounding valleys such as the ebro valley the climate is predominantly influenced by mediterranean features in its eastern side and atlantic influences in its western side with an alpine climate in the highest areas furthermore the topography results in large spatial precipitation and temperature variability in the adour garonne river basin the southeastern part is dominated by the mediterranean climate whereas the western part is influenced by atlantic ocean conditions precipitation varies on average from 600 mm in the middle part of the basin to 2000 mm in the south part and atlantic coast the precipitation decreases with both the topography and the distance to the atlantic seasonally precipitation has two maxima one in winter and a second in spring similarly on the spanish side of the pyrenees precipitation decreases from west to east and from north to south annual precipitation varies from 100 mm in the central ebro valley to more than 2000 mm in the highest areas the precipitation regime is characterized by high interannual variability lópez justribó 2010 particularly in mediterranean areas most of the annual precipitation occurs during spring and autumn although in some regions the maximum precipitation occurs during the cold season in the atlantic areas in the pyrenees and in the central ebro valley the summers are mainly dry lópez moreno et al 2008 2011 the pyrenees considered as natural water towers for its surrounding basins provide the water that satisfies the downstream demands for human and environmental needs immerzeel et al 2019 the main water uses in the adour garonne basin are agricultural and industrial in the ebro water demands by the agricultural sector represent 92 of the total water volume of the basin this being the main water use in the basin http www chebro es guest uso del agua this agricultural development was made possible by the construction of several dams that regulate the river flows and store water for dry periods the large number of dams has caused major alterations in river regimes and reduced the magnitude of floods nevertheless low flows were also affected being reduced by an order of magnitude which is undesirable for ecological purposes environmental flows batalla et al 2004 additionally the ever expanding human activity mainly irrigation has increased the pressure on the water resources of the basin 3 data and models in this section we describe the observational streamflow database used it together with the model and physiographic database 3 1 streamflow data the observational streamflow database used was gathered by the efa210 16 piragua project zabaleta et al 2022 it consists of daily streamflow records from the different river basin authorities that manage the water in the study area for our analysis we considered a final database comprising 392 gauging stations that encompasses the temporal period between september 1979 and august 2014 35 years of these 104 were selected as natural and near natural gauging stations analyzing the data and metadata as indicate the fig 1 a with black circles the selection was carried out following the criteria below 1 only stations with at least 20 years of data within the analysis period were considered 2 data gaps of less than 10 of the total record length these gaps were not filled were allowed 3 flows must have a natural or near natural hydrological regime i e the stations must not be downstream of important human influenced areas e g reservoirs irrigation areas for calibration purposes from the selection of natural stations previously done we selected outlet stations with series starting in 1979 and with at least 30 years of records fig 1b shows the final selection which resulted in 31 outlet stations in total 53 sub catchments if we consider the nested catchments 3 2 description of saser model saser safran surfex eaudysee rapid is a distributed and physically based modeling chain consisting of a meteorological forcing a lsm and a routing scheme système d analyse fournissant des renseignements atmosphériques à la neige safran durand et al 1993 is a meteorological analysis system that produces the meteorological gridded forcing dataset using an optimal interpolation algorithm which exploits the output of a meteorological model as first guess and in situ observations safran provides hourly meteorological data which is then ingested by the lsm the safran dataset used here is piragua atmos analysis quintana seguí le cointe 2022 which was created within the efa210 16 piragua project and corresponds to a union of the french quintana seguí et al 2008 vidal et al 2010 and the spanish quintana seguí et al 2016 2017 implementations of safran it has a temporal resolution of one hour and a spatial resolution of 2 5 km the lsm used by saser is surfex surface externalisée in french masson et al 2013 version 8 1 it uses the interaction soil biospère atmosphère isba scheme habets et al 2008 to simulate natural surfaces which describes the vertical processes in the soil column and generates a runoff and a drainage that flows through the hydrosystem using eaudysée saleh et al 2011 vergnes habets 2018 and the routing application for parallel computation of discharge rapid scheme david et al 2011 we used the surfex simulations of the piragua hydro analysis dataset beguería et al 2022 which were performed using the same grid as the piragua atmos analysis eaudysée and rapid were run at a resolution of 1 km using the hydrosheds database lehner grill 2013 to describe the stream network some limitations of the current saser implementations are that i there is no lateral flow between surfex grid cells ii there is no bidirectional interaction between the river and the alluvial aquifer and iii groundwater processes are not simulated this translates into a fast reaction between runoff and precipitation therefore a better representation of groundwater storage is necessary to account for the slow processes groundwater and snow melting 3 3 physiography in this study we used the surfex s default physiographic database ecoclimap ii faroux et al 2013 it has a spatial resolution of 1 km and includes an ecosystem classification as well as a consistent set of land surface parameters in contrast to commonly used land cover products like corine land cover and global land cover ecoclimap ii has a new division of the existing classes with a better regional character obtained from the climatic environment latitude proximity to the sea topography the land cover parameters provided in this dataset include root depth minimal stomatal resistance albedo and leaf area index lai the temporal variables are represented using a climatology i e a mean annual cycle additionally we used the copernicus ndvi product which was obtained from https land copernicus eu global products ndvi last access 2022 06 07 3 4 simpa model reference simpa integrated precipitation streamflow modelling system in its original acronym in spanish is a conceptual and semi distributed hydrological model developed in the centre for public works studies and experimentation cedex in spain estrela quintas 1996 simpa simulates the natural water balance and provides information about the main hydrological variables precipitation evapotranspiration streamflow at a monthly time step simpa is used by the spanish authorities for water resources evaluation 4 methods this section presents a detailed description of the methods implemented to improve low flow simulation fig 2 shows the schematic flowchart with the steps of the two methodologies used that are described below 4 1 conceptual reservoir the implementation of a conceptual reservoir is based on the formulation from rainfall runoff models like arno todini 1996 or topmodel beven kirkby 1979 the major difference being that the reservoir here presented is implemented as an external module in the lsm model as a postprocessing of the drainage to account for a better representation of slow component of simulated streamflow we introduced a conceptual reservoir at grid point level to improve the slow component of the streamflow we did not modify the partitioning between surface runoff and drainage done by surfex lsm the reservoir purpose is to modulate the drainage simulated by surfex to sustaining it during the dry period before being fed to the river routing component eaudysée rapid fig 3 moreover surface runoff is not modified to avoid an excessive role of empirical parameters on the hydrological response of the model the input to the reservoir is the drainage generated by surfex the reservoir has two outflows the first mimics a baseflow and is the main contributing term sustaining flow during the dry period the second occurs when the reservoir exceeds the maximum threshold so there is no time lag when drainage is simulated during the wet season when the reservoir is full the total reservoir outflow is calculated following equations 1 to 3 1 l i τ d i 1 τ k l i 1 q ov 2 q di k l i 1 q ov and 3 q ov m a x 0 l i 1 l m a x τ where di mm day 1 is the drainage li mm the water content of the reservoir k day 1 and lmax mm are empirical parameters which correspond to the depletion coefficient and the size of the reservoir respectively qdi mm day 1 is the total reservoir outflow qov mm day 1 is the reservoir outflow and τ is a constant with a value of 1 day the subindices i and i 1 represent the current time step and the previous step respectively finally qdi is added to surfex s runoff and sent to eaudysée rapid to compute daily streamflow 4 2 model performance evaluation in different steps calibration validation and regionalization we need to evaluate the performance of the simulations we chose the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 as our objective function 4 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the pearson s correlation coefficient α is the bias component and β represent the ratio of discharge variance 5 α m s m o a n d β σ s σ o m and σ represent the mean and standard deviation respectively similarly subscripts s and o represent simulated and observed discharge respectively the kge over untransformed discharge puts more weight on high flows garcia et al 2017 and since our analysis is focused on low flows we used a root square transformation kge q1 2 which allows balancing the weight on low and high flow without losing the physical meaning santos et al 2018 for performance metrics is important have a benchmark to determine when the model performance is strength or not clark et al 2021 the more traditional nash suttclife nse criterion nash sutcliffe 1970 uses the average of the observations as a benchmark this means that nse 0 if the model performed better than the benchmark knoben et al 2019 demonstrated that using the same reasoning nse 0 in the kge criteria is not consistent they showed that kge values greater than 0 41 indicate an improvement over the mean flow benchmark therefore we used a kge value of 0 41 as the baseline value only within the context of the genetic algorithm which must evaluate the goodness of fit of each member of the population at each step we used a transformation of the kge 6 kg e b kge 2 k g e this transformation avoids the skewed distribution of efficiencies for large samples mathevet et al 2006 4 3 reservoir parameter calibration procedure the size of the reservoir lmax and the depletion coefficient k have to be calibrated for calibration and validation we use a classical split sample procedure therefore we split the entire record into two halves the calibration period spans from 01 09 1979 to 31 08 1997 and the validation period from 01 09 1997 to 31 08 2014 both parameters were calibrated at the sub catchment scale on a catchment by catchment basis against locally observed streamflow data which involves that all the grid points belonging to the sub catchment had the same values of the parameters hereafter we will refer to this step as local calibration the grid resolution and the distribution of hydrological stations allowed us to use a nested approach to calibrate the parameters where streamflow data were available thus the parameters were calibrated first on the upstream sub catchments and then progressively towards the outlet we set the valid range for both parameters using similar criteria defined by artinyan et al 2008 the accumulated streamflow of the dry period from july to september should be close to the average reservoir level lmax parameter for each sub catchment we obtained the total runoff volume for the dry period of the driest year of the calibration period qdry in mm and lmax was estimated as 12qdry lmax qdry according to artinyan et al 2008 twelve times the volume of the driest months seems a reasonable upper bound for this parameter the limits of the depletion coefficient k were calculated considering the length of the dry period thus the reservoir has drainage releases during the length of the dry period we create a parameter space for simulations purposes where the range between the extreme values of each parameter was discretized into 12 values a total of 144 simulations were carried out and the performance of each simulation was evaluated for each sub catchment using the kge q1 2 see section 4 2 the best simulation for each sub catchment was chosen and the parameter set associated with each of them was saved 4 4 regionalization of the parameters when observational data are not available or they do not have good quality or they include processes that are not simulated such as human processes dams and irrigation local calibration is unfeasible to overcome this limitation we used the regionalization approach presented by beck et al 2020 which allows setting the values of the reservoir parameters all over the domain going beyond the near natural basins used in the calibration procedure 4 4 1 predictors used for the regionalization for the regionalization approach we selected eight physiographic variables as predictors three of them were related to climate ari aridity index map mean annual precipitation and pet potential evaporation beck et al 2016 nijssen et al 2001 singh et al 2014 and troch et al 2013 demonstrated that these variables exert an important influence on the flow response in regionalization studies at global scale the map predictor was transformed to square root to better fit a normal distribution the ndvi normalized difference vegetation index and snw fraction of snow with respect to the total precipitation are predictors related to land cover the ndvi was added because the vegetation influences in the evaporation infiltration and hydrological function of the soil which may also affect the slow component low flows and runoff rainfall conversion processes zhang et al 2001 donohue et al 2007 peel 2009 the snow affects the land cover and has an important role in streamflow generation in mountain regions and also on the slow component of the flow finally sl the slope snd soil sand content and cly soil clay content are variables related to the topography and the soil the slope predictor was included due to the good general correlation between surface slope and soil depth tesfa et al 2009 and the soil texture has a strong influence on all soil related processes including subsurface runoff price 2011 most of these variables were obtained from the ecoclimap ii database although these descriptors are not directly associated with groundwater they help determine a landscape that can be prone or not to groundwater 4 4 2 regionalization approach the regionalization approach uses a genetic algorithm to optimize the coefficients of the transfer equations these equations link the reservoir parameters predictands to the physiographic variables predictors we use the same near natural basis that in the local calibration all of them have an area smaller than 5 000 km2 for the optimization the reservoir scheme was run at daily time step and at same surfex spatial resolution for the whole period 1979 2014 the surfex runoff and reservoir output were spatially aggregated and compared with observed runoff this comparison is possible due to the size of the catchments that allows us to discard channel routing effects gericke smithers 2014 the methodology is shown in fig 2 right panel and a detailed description is presented below since the reservoir is implemented as an external module to postprocess the surfex drainage before the routing step there is no need to run surfex within the genetic algorithm see fig 3 this is a key benefit as surfex is a computationally expensive model furthermore given the size of the catchments there is no need to run the routing scheme eaudyssee rapid at each iteration see fig 4 this allows us to undertake a very high number of simulations as we only run the very simple reservoir model which consists of a few lines of python code the transfer equations that link the predictors with the predictands are expressed as follows 7 m p i w i 1 a r i w i 2 m a p w i 3 p e t w i 4 n d v i w i 5 s n w w i 6 s l w i 7 s n d w i 8 c l y w i 9 where mpi are the model parameters k and l max and wi are the coefficients that will be optimized the eight predictors chosen are see the previous section ari aridity index p pet map mean annual precipitation root square transformed pet mean annual potential evaporation ndvi mean normalized difference vegetation index snw the fraction of snow with respect to the total precipitation sl topographic slope snd soil sand content and cly soil clay content first each predictor was interpolated to the same grid as the model uses 2 5 km of resolution next as beck et al 2020 did predictor values were clipped using the 99th and 1st percentiles of the area covered by the sub catchments finally to make the predictors comparable to each other they were standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing the results by the standard deviation of the area covered by the sub catchments the coefficients of the transfer equations 9 2 18 wi were optimized using our own implementation of the μ λ genetic algorithm slowik kwasnicka 2020 the μ λ algorithm indicates that selected parents and children together comprise the new population offspring for the next iteration the algorithm starts with a random population λ of 32 members all of them are evaluated using the performance score kgeb and the best three members are selected and saved for the next iteration μ size of the parents in the population subsequently through the mutation operator the offspring is created λ μ children are randomly created from each selected parent following a normal distribution within the search space a maximum number of 100 iterations was set fig 4 represents the main steps in the optimization process first predictor maps are obtained depending on the area covered by the catchments used second the parameter maps are calculated using transfer equations to subsequently apply the reservoir scheme this scheme is run using as input the daily drainage simulated by surfex the reservoir output modulated drainage and the surfex runoff are spatially aggregated all cells that comprise each catchment and compared to observed streamflow of each catchment using the kge score to avoid overfitting and to have an indicator of uncertainty in the parameter sets cross validation was used for this the catchment set was subdivided into training 87 and validation 13 subsets this selection was performed randomly the catchments used for validation were used only once in each iteration performing different experiments until all of them were used in the validation in total 8 experiments were run each experiment consists of a training subset 27 catchments and 4 randomly selected catchments for independent validation in this sense the validation subset in each experiment is different because each catchment was used only once 4 5 low flow indices in addition to calculating the kge scores and to evaluate how the conceptual reservoir implementation local calibration and regionalization approach impacted the simulated low flows we calculate two low flow indices different low flow indices can be estimated gustard et al 1992 smakhtin 2001 but we focused on two common ones first the ratio q90 q50 where q50 is the median and the q90 is the low value that is observed 1 10th of the time at daily time step this index is interpreted as the proportion of streamflow originating from groundwater stores excluding the effects of the catchment area smakhtin 2001 second the annual minimum monthly flow with a return period of 5 years qmna 5 which is widely used in france for water management issues and provides information about low flow severity to compute the qmna 5 we calculated the 5 year return period for each sub catchment fitting it to a log normal distribution for low flows catalogne 2012 based on a series with at least 30 years of record we derived the low flows indices for the summer period july to september for each station and computed both using the observations and the simulations then we calculated the relative bias to evaluate and compare the performance of the simulations 5 results 5 1 model performance of default saser simulation to evaluate the performance of the saser model default simulation we calculated the kge q1 2 and used the 104 stations defined as natural or near natural which are indicated by circles with black border in fig 5 fig 5 shows the calculated kge scores for the entire period 1979 2014 stations with the highest kge values are located mainly in the pyrenean region where direct human influence is low however most of the stations in the ebro river basin a highly influenced basin showed lower kge values especially in areas downstream of the reservoirs this was expected since the model must perform poorly over human influenced areas as it only simulates natural processes if we focus on the near natural basins fig 1a we see that 11 of 104 stations uncolored circles in fig 4 show kge values below the baseline value of 0 41 these lower values belong to stations located at a closer junction of small tributaries with the main channel same saser pixel and due to resolution constraints 2 5 km saser takes the simulated streamflow to the main channel and not from the tributary for the rest of the stations 17 and 42 showed values greater than 0 7 and 0 5 respectively in fig 6 we compare the observed obs in beige and simulated default in red statistics of the streamflow for the different percentiles near natural basins and the 53 catchments where the reservoir was calibrated the saser model default simulates reasonably well high and median daily streamflow represented by the 90th to 99th percentiles and 50th to 75th percentiles respectively however low flows 25th percentile and below are underestimated as depicted in the red boxes in fig 6 for example the median relative bias between observed discharge and default simulation for the 25th percentile is 66 whereas for the 95th percentile is 12 this shows that low flows are poorly simulated by the default saser model 5 2 evaluation of the model including the reservoir with calibrated parameters fig 7 shows the result of the calibration of the two model parameters lmax and k in the near natural basins they were calibrated empirically by running the reservoir scheme the values of the lmax parameter ranged from a minimum of 4 mm to a maximum of 600 mm with an average value of 108 mm while the values of parameter k ranged from 0 01 to 0 04 with a median value of 0 018 at the end of the calibration process we observed the following results most ebro catchments have the same value of parameter k 0 02 whereas the parameter lmax varies over a wider range of values these parameter values are explained by basin characteristics such as soil type topography etc for example higher lmax values correspond to sub catchments with high permeability e g south of france detailed information is presented in discussion section fig 8 summarizes the resulting kge scores and shows that adding a calibrated conceptual reservoir improves them over all catchments on the one hand panel a shows that for the calibration period the median kge value of the default simulation was 0 63 and using the reservoir scheme it was 0 72 which represents a clear improvement with respect to the default simulation for the validation period panel b the default simulation has a score of 0 60 and the calibrated one of 0 71 which is a similar improvement than that from the calibration period panel c compares the difference between the scores of the calibrated model with the reservoir obtained during the calibration and validation periods the two lines are very close which is an indicator of robustness the model performs similarly inside and outside the calibration period the resulting time series fig 9 shows graphically that the calibrated reservoir produces time series closer to the observations the kge values where higher for the simulation using the reservoir scheme for both periods panels a and b of fig 9 show the time series of the daily streamflow at two stations only two years of the calibration period are depicted in order to make the plots easy to read and panels c and d show the same stations for the validation period the improved model is able to sustain the summer flows much better than the default model without affecting the median and high flows the blue boxes in fig 6 clearly show that the lower percentiles of the simulation with the calibrated reservoir are improved compared to the default simulation for the three percentiles related to low flows the 5th 10th and 25th the values of median relative bias for default simulation were 90 84 and 66 respectively whereas the values obtained from the simulation with reservoir scheme were 37 33 and 17 for the same percentiles even though the values remain slightly underestimated it represents an improvement in low flow simulation 5 3 evaluation of the regionalization approach as an example fig 10 shows the evolution of the kge and the kgeb for one of the experiments we recall that the kge and kgeb are related through equation 6 each point represents the model performance after each iteration of the genetic algorithm while it searches for the best solution for this experiment during the first iterations the kge rapidly increases and after iteration 30 the slope of the curve changes drastically to be almost flat which indicates that the algorithm is close to a maximum in this case the median kge is slightly higher than 0 53 as the new mutations do not improve the result and are not selected similar behavior was founded in all the experiments fig 11 shows the boxplots of the resulting kge for the independent catchments of each experiment and compares it with the kge obtained from the default and local calibration experiments the median daily kge value of the default simulation was 0 41 and the median daily kge value of the local calibration was 0 53 while for the regionalization it was 0 52 its value is close to the obtained by the local calibration furthermore we obtained improvements in 79 of the validation catchments this confirms the robustness of the regionalization approach to improve low flows in the catchments that were not used in the training dataset also the kge scores are as good as using the local calibration fig 12 shows the distribution of the kge values for the different experiments starting from the left the graph shows i the default simulation brown ii the local calibration dark blue which represents a clear improvement iii the eight different regionalization experiments light green and iv three additional experiments light brown the eight regionalization experiments show median kge values very close to each other around 0 51 in fig 12 the 75th percentile top edge of each box of all experiments shows a similar value close to 0 6 while the minimum values lower whiskers show greater variability suggesting that catchments for which the kge score was poor are more sensitive the three additional experiments last three boxes in fig 12 where performed to see how the eight experiments can be combined to obtain a final result in the first additional experiment we calculate the median time series of the eight previous experiments in the second we run the reservoir scheme with the median value of the k and lmax parameter maps median value of the parameters for each grid point and calculate streamflow in the last experiment we calculated the median value of each parameter 57 mm and 0 016 for lmax and k respectively and run the reservoir scheme with these homogeneous values over the entire domain surprisingly these three extra experiments showed a similar kge median values when we compare to previous experiments however the last experiment fixed median values showed a slightly larger spread among kge values in any case in the local calibration or regionalization approach kge values are not below 0 41 the benchmark defined previously an example of one year of observed and simulated by aggregating runoff and drainage daily streamflow for one catchment is given in fig 13 in this plot we computed the median flow of the eight regionalization experiments dark blue line and we also plotted in light blue the confidence interval of the simulations 5 4 computing natural streamflow with the improved model once the maps of the two parameters of the reservoir model were obtained using the median value of the parameter maps of the eight experiments fig a1 we proceed to calculate the final streamflow using the river routing scheme fig 14 presents the streamflow simulation performance obtained using the median values of the eight regionalization experiments for the entire record 1979 2014 over the complete database of the total stations 47 showed higher kge values than 0 5 5 more compared to the default simulation fig 14 b shows the improvement in terms of δkge due to regionalization for the whole period for comparison purposes we calculated the kge values over the same periods that were used for local the local calibration 1979 1997 and validation 1997 2014 for the first period calibration the regionalization approach obtains a median kge of 0 69 and for the second one validation it was 0 67 which is very close fig 15 summarizes the performance of local calibration and regionalization approach over the calibration solid lines and validation validation lines periods on the near natural basins both approaches showed an improvement compared to the default simulation without the reservoir the best kge values are provided by the local calibration which we expected even though the regionalization approach showed very close values to local calibration the advantage of the regionalization approach is that it allows us to estimate the values of the parameters anywhere in the area of study thus we can also calculate improved natural flows on influenced basins where local calibration would be impossible 5 4 1 comparison with a reference model as the observations are affected by water management we compare our results with an independent model in this case we use the simpa model which is used by water managers in the ebro river basin we extracted the time series simulated by the default and the improved model on the outlet of the ebro river basin located in tortosa we computed the mean annual cycle of streamflow for the period 1980 to 2006 at the monthly time step and plotted it fig 16 together with the observations in black and the simpa model in green the default simulation in red presents the lowest flows during the summer from july to september as expected whereas the peak flow occurs in january in general the hydrograph of the default simulation has a shape similar to that of the observations but with a positive bias the positive bias is expected as in the real basin there is more evapotranspiration due to irrigation than in the naturalized one in contrast the simpa model gray line shows two peaks one in december and the other in april and the minimum streamflow corresponds to the summer months but with values twice higher than the observations the flows obtained with the improved model setting the parameters with the regionalization approach green line show a clear increase of low flows but they are still very low compared to simpa it is notable that the improved model reduces the january peak but increases the streamflow of the following months february and march the new hydrograph presents a double peak which is what we expected and what can be seen in simpa it is notable how the reservoir modifies the streamflow of the winter months this could not be seen in the daily hydrographs we showed in fig 13 but this arises clearly in the monthly annual cycle of the outlet which aggregates the changes throughout the basin nevertheless is difficult to determine which model is closer to reality because the observations represent the real basin not the naturalized one as the models do 5 5 low flow indices evaluation in fig 17 we can see the improvements in the low flow indices for the q90 q50 ratio left panel of fig 17 the default simulation without reservoir showed a median relative bias of 80 with respect to observations whereas the median relative bias of the simulation adding a reservoir was of 32 in both cases this index is underestimated but there is a significant gain due to the reservoir implementation on the other hand the qmna 5 right panel of fig 17 also showed an improvement in median relative bias from 64 of the default simulations to 20 of the simulation adding a reservoir in the case of regionalization approach green boxes in fig 17 low flow indices reported values of median relative bias of 26 and 22 for the q90 q50 ratio and qmna 5 respectively these values are practically same to the local calibration only the 75th percentile top edge of the box for the q90 q50 shows a larger difference in any case although low flow indices still remain underestimated the inclusion and calibration of a reservoir using either approach noticeably improves the simulated values of the low flow indices and the regionalization approach behaves very well compared to the local calibration one 6 discussion we used a conceptual approach based on rainfall runoff models to improve the streamflow simulated by saser adding a reservoir at the grid scale resolution this is intended to provide a better representation of the slow component in the hydrological response which is not well simulated by surfex results show that the additional reservoir which is simple and easy to calibrate has a very positive impact on the streamflow simulation however the calibration of the reservoir parameters is only possible in gauged natural basins which are not numerous in the area of study the implementation of the conceptual reservoir has as its main objective to sustain the flows without having a significant impact on the daily high and medium flows surface runoff for this reason the reservoir scheme is implemented as a postprocessing of just the drainage which is the slow component this redistribution of the water volume does not affect the shape of the hydrograph during peak events during the summer months there is a significant improvement in the low flow simulation as shown in fig 16 this fact supports the effectiveness of the reservoir to improve the streamflow simulation at the same time at the monthly step we see that the annual cycle has changed considerably redistributing water from winter to summer and obtaining a more realistic double peaked hydrograph at the outlet of the ebro basin a regionalization approach was established to find the values of the parameters for all the grid points of the area of study not only those located in near natural basins this approach uses physiographic and climate related predictors although these variables are not immediately associated with groundwater they exert an indirect influence on the runoff response therefore those predictors are acting as proxies for defining the predictands moreover several previous regionalization studies have emphasized the use of those predictors nijssen et al 2001 singh et al 2014 beck et al 2016 2020 the performance of the model with regionalized parameters is almost as good as that of the catchment by catchment local calibration approach as reported kge values in the local calibration approach the values of the parameters are lumped which probably would not work well in larger basins thus the regionalization approach would probably be more advantaged if tested in larger basins additionally having lumped values of the parameters per basin does not play well with a model that is mostly physical and which tries to be as spatially distributed as possible the regionalization approach allows us to apply the reservoir everywhere in the study domain even in heavily human influenced areas where a local calibration approach is not feasible due to the lack of validation data we have compared our simulation with a reference one simpa the results from such an experiment are less easily interpretable still least it makes it evident that the differences are lower now even if they remain very large when compare with the reference model the maps of the reservoir parameters produced by the regionalization approach are presented in fig a1 these maps cover the full domain at 2 5 km resolution and vary according to climate and physiographic information that we used as predictors it is difficult to explain the spatial patterns due to the complex and strong connection between the different variables e g climate vegetation and soil properties involved troch et al 2013 despite we can identify spatial patterns related to known hydrological processes at least in one of the parameter maps l reservoir size patterns in this parameter associated to soil moisture content can be explained by the land cover precipitation and soil granulometric distribution for example in the region of the south west of france where large sand deposits exist landes the runoff response is quick and infiltration has high rates thus a buffer is required to play the role of groundwater storage and sustain the flows during the dry season and hence the values of the reservoir size are expected to be larger than in clay predominated regions on the other hand the patterns in the map of the k parameter are not easily interpreted both soil properties and topography influence the distribution of water storage and isolating the influence of each other is problematic price 2011 different regionalization experiments were carried out to account the equifinality problem multiple optimal solutions providing reasonably similar or equal model performance values which is one of the most important sources of uncertainty in hydrological modeling beven freer 2001 furthermore in each experiment cross validation process was used that allows us to estimate the generalizability of the parameters and provides an indication of uncertainty previous experiments done not showed here indicated that the parameters used to initialize the genetic algorithm have a strong influence over the search direction and efficiency score as shown in fig 13 light blue bands time series of simulated daily streamflow provide in general a wide range of streamflow uncertainty bands derived from the parameter sets especially at the end of the wet season and gradually decreasing during the dry season july to august otherwise the uncertainty bands during the winter months were of much lesser extent except in some months november and december this could be explained by the fact that the reservoir configuration focuses only on low flows however an extensive parameter uncertainty assessment is beyond the scope of this study in addition to kge scores and to understand how well the additional reservoir simulates low flows which is the main objective of the study we evaluated the q90 q50 and the qmna 5 indices the negative relative bias in both indices of default simulation suggests a fast precipitation to runoff reaction of the saser model hence the low flows are underestimated during the dry periods results of our different simulations local calibration or regionalization approach adding the reservoir showed a considerable improvement in both indices although they are still slightly underestimated suggesting the suitability of the conceptual reservoir to improve the simulation of the slow component of the streamflow even though other aspects of the model still need to be improved a key result of this work is that introducing a conceptual reservoir in the saser model is useful even if we cannot easily calibrate the parameters in each catchment provided that values of the parameters are reasonable this was demonstrated by different simulations eight experiments and the three extra experiments using lumped parameters carried out even if it is difficult to know which the most appropriated parameter maps is at least we know that all of them produce reasonable results and that all of them are considerably better than the simulation without the reservoir default 7 conclusions the main objective of this study is to improve the simulation of low streamflow in the hydrometeorological model saser by using a simple conceptual reservoir scheme to postprocess the drainage and thus improve the slow component of the streamflow the saser simulations were made over a period of 35 years in an area that covers the pyrenees and surrounding basins the default saser model presents a strong negative bias of low flow indices the addition of a reservoir scheme to modulate the drainage had a positive result in terms of kge values when the parameters were set using a local calibration method both for the calibration and validation periods the addition of a conceptual reservoir proved to be a simple and efficient option with a limited number of parameters which improves the low flows simulated by surfex without deteriorating high flows as shown in the improvement of the low flow indices studied qmna 5 and q90 q5 0 a regionalization approach based on a genetic algorithm was introduced to determine the values of the parameters all over the domain including basins heavily influenced by water management where a standard local calibration of these parameters is not possible results of the regionalization approach showed a clear general improvement of simulated streamflow δkge 0 11 with an improvement for 79 of the validation catchments those results were almost as good as using local calibration both kge scores and the two low flow indices indicate improvements especially for the low flow indices although a small negative bias of the low flow indices remains the regionalization approach based on a genetic algorithm was possible due to the simplicity of the conceptual model and its implementation as an external module of surfex applying this approach to calibrate other empirical parameters within the surfex model itself would be desirable but impractical due to computational constrains we established a relationship between the parameters of the conceptual reservoir with climate and physiographic variables through the genetic algorithm which allows us to take into account the within catchment variability all over the study area although this approach is not physically based it allows linking the two new parameters with variables that are physical which is a good compromise for a model that tries to be distributed and as physical as possible in conclusion the addition of a conceptual reservoir to postprocess the saser simulated drainage led to considerable improvement in low flow simulation the regionalization approach allows us to apply the reservoir all over the domain including the human influenced basins

8538,in global applications and data sparse regions which comprise most of the earth hydrologic model based flood monitoring relies on precipitation data from satellite multisensor precipitation products or numerical weather forecasts however these products often exhibit substantial errors during the meteorological conditions that lead to flooding including extreme rainfall the propagation of precipitation forcing errors to predicted runoff and streamflow is scale dependent and requires an understanding of the autocorrelation structure of precipitation errors since error autocorrelation impacts the accumulation of precipitation errors over space and time in hydrologic models previous efforts to account for satellite precipitation uncertainty in hydrologic models have demonstrated the potential for improving streamflow estimates however these efforts use satellite precipitation error models that rely heavily on ground reference data such as rain gages or weather radar and do not characterize the nonstationarity of precipitation error autocorrelation structures this work evaluates a new method the space time rainfall error and autocorrelation model stream which stochastically generates possible true precipitation fields as input to the hillslope link model to generate ensemble streamflow estimates unlike previous error models stream represents the nonstationary and anisotropic autocorrelation structure of satellite precipitation error and does not use any ground reference to do so ensemble streamflow predictions are compared with streamflow generated using satellite precipitation fields as well as a radar gage precipitation dataset during peak flow events results demonstrate that this approach to accounting for precipitation uncertainty effectively characterizes the uncertainty in streamflow estimates and reduces the error of predicted streamflow streamflow ensembles forced by stream improve streamflow prediction nearly to the level obtained using ground reference forcing data across basin sizes keywords satellite methods precipitation catchment dynamics uncertainty data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 motivation hydrologic models are central to efforts to mitigate the devastating impacts of floods and are used around the world to predict streamflow with particular interest in high streamflow events that cause flooding e g alfieri et al 2013 wu et al 2014 despite continual advances these models cannot perfectly predict streamflow for a number of reasons in addition to model uncertainty i e imperfect representation of physical processes and parameter uncertainty forcing uncertainty due to errors in rainfall data whether obtained from gauge data radar numerical weather prediction model nwp forecasts or satellite multi sensor precipitation smp products leads to errors in runoff and streamflow estimates hong et al 2006 sperna weiland et al 2015 in global hydrologic modeling studies precipitation forcing data has been found to be the primary driver of predictive uncertainty and using parameter calibration to compensate for biases in meteorological forcing data can actually result in inconsistent performance between calibration and evaluation periods leading to calls for improved characterization of global rainfall amounts at spatial resolutions of 0 5 and smaller fekete et al 2004 sperna weiland et al 2015 precipitation uncertainty in basins in high latitudes and the tropics leads to hydrologic uncertainty of the same or greater magnitudes due to the relatively moist soil conditions and propensity of rainfall to become runoff in these regions biemans et al 2009 fekete et al 2004 precipitation error propagation is more variable in semi arid regions where the rainfall runoff generation processes are highly nonlinear fekete et al 2004 initial and simulated soil moisture conditions in watersheds which are also critical to accurate streamflow prediction are dependent on multiple previous precipitation events alvarez garreton et al 2014 tramblay et al 2010 tramblay et al 2011 the issue of precipitation uncertainty in streamflow prediction is particularly prevalent in regional to global scale efforts which due to lack of alternatives typically must rely on either precipitation from satellites or numerical weather models both of which are prone to substantially larger errors than in situ gage measurements examples include the global flood monitoring system gfms wu et al 2014 and the global flood awareness system glofas alfieri et al 2013 these use nasa s integrated multisatellite retrieval for the global measurement mission imerg and the ecmwf integrated forecast system efs data respectively to generate global streamflow predictions similar to other satellite multi sensor precipitation products imerg precipitation estimates exhibit considerable systematic bias and random error and imerg often overestimates rainfall during extreme precipitation events e g anjum et al 2018 asong et al 2017 gilewski nawalany 2018 omranian et al 2018 wang et al 2017 a number of studies have demonstrated that imerg can introduce large uncertainties into streamflow predictions when compared with gauge based or radar gauge products although the extent to which imerg based results underperform varies amorim et al 2020 jiang bauer gottwein 2019 li et al 2016 for instance imerg forced streamflow predictions across china were shown to exhibit substantially more error in arid watersheds than humid watersheds jiang et al 2019 for a thorough review of the use of satellite multi sensor precipitation smp products in hydrologic modeling see quintero et al 2016 hydrologic modeling is not the only satellite precipitation application that contends with satellite precipitation uncertainty land surface modeling snow simulations groundwater modeling and landslide hazard assessment are also susceptible to errors in output when ingesting erroneous precipitation data e g hartke et al 2020 maggioni et al 2011 marc et al 2022 pradhan indu 2021 raleigh et al 2015 schreiner mcgraw ajami 2020 serpetzoglou et al 2010 shrestha et al 2020 although this work focuses on accounting for uncertainty in smp data numerical weather prediction model nwp precipitation fields also exhibit similar levels of bias and random error including high uncertainties during extreme events due to a highly dynamic atmosphere and the sensitivity of model precipitation forecasts to a range of model parameters e g lowrey yang 2008 luitel et al 2018 moosavi et al 2021 nasrollahi et al 2012 nogueira 2020 1 2 precipitation error modeling background within hydrologic models runoff is accumulated over a range of basin sizes and precipitation error propagation is dependent on both basin scale as well as the autocorrelation of precipitation errors in space and time cunha et al 2012 nijssen lettenmaier 2004 nikolopoulos et al 2010 error autocorrelation describes the intuitive fact that an overestimation of precipitation by imerg at a pixel in a given timestep likely corresponds to an overestimation by imerg in surrounding pixels and timesteps while accumulation during rainfall runoff generation processes can serve to average out random errors in precipitation datasets it can also serve to accumulate a field of precipitation with correlated errors i e precipitation being overestimated over an entire storm system and propagate these into streamflow predictions cunha et al 2012 found the efficiency of the river basin in filtering out random errors to be highly sensitive to the presence of spatial correlation in errors and that when rainfall errors are correlated in space the process of aggregation and attenuation by the river network is not as effective in filtering out uncertainties correctly simulating the autocorrelation of precipitation error fields is paramount to capturing precipitation uncertainty at coarser scales e g basin scales hartke et al 2022 just like the correlation structure of precipitation the correlation structure of precipitation error fields is anisotropic and nonstationary in time and space changing depending on the observed precipitation system and retrieval conditions i e errors may exhibit lower spatial autocorrelation during a scattered precipitation event than during a larger and more highly spatially autocorrelated frontal precipitation event a number of smp error models have been introduced that generate distributions to describe the uncertainty surrounding a given smp estimate at a single time and pixel i e kirstetter et al 2018 maggioni et al 2014 wright et al 2017 see section 3 3 one of the major limitations of these pixel scale error formulations is that they do not relate the uncertainty of smp estimates across space and time there is no intuitive way to combine the uncertainty distributions at every pixel in a field to create an ensemble of precipitation error fields previous work has attempted to link pixel scale precipitation uncertainty estimates using calibrated correlation coefficients or lengths to quantify the space time autocorrelation structure of errors e g ciach et al 2007 hossain anagnostou 2006 but such approaches do not represent the nonstationarity of satellite precipitation errors and rely on ground reference data for calibration previous studies on ensemble smp error correction in hydrologic modeling have utilized the two dimensional satellite rainfall error model srem2d hossain anagnostou 2006 which does not account for the nonstationarity and anisotropy of smp error correlation structures falck et al 2015 2018 2021 maggioni et al 2013 these studies demonstrate that the inclusion of precipitation uncertainty using ensemble methods does generally improve streamflow prediction although not always in large basins when an error model applies bias correction to entire basin areas as shown with srem2d in falck et al 2015 but do so using an approach that is not viable for most of the world due to a scarcity of ground based data which is unlikely to change 1 3 incorporating satellite precipitation uncertainty into hydrologic modeling accounting for precipitation uncertainty in hydrologic modeling applications poses a challenge because of the probabilistic nature of precipitation uncertainty the nonstationary correlation structure of precipitation errors and the need to calibrate precipitation uncertainty models with little to no ground reference data in many parts of the world the space time rainfall error and autocorrelation model stream was developed with an eye to overcoming these challenges hartke et al 2022 stream stochastically generates a precipitation ensemble that represents the possible true precipitation based on a satellite precipitation field or a numerical weather forecast it consists of two pieces 1 using an uncalibrated nonstationary error autocorrelation scheme that requires no ground reference data and 2 pixel scale uncertainty estimates that can be obtained from existing error model formulations by not calibrating the autocorrelation scheme on historical ground reference or smp error fields and instead replicating the changing anisotropic autocorrelation structure of smp fields stream nimbly incorporates nonstationarity into its representation of smp uncertainty like previous ensemble based approaches stream ensembles can be ingested by smp applications including hydrologic models without any modification to the model structure one strategy to address precipitation uncertainty in hydrologic modeling is bias correction e g charles et al 2020 ciupak et al 2019 habib et al 2014 ji et al 2020 however when applied in near real time this approach only adjusts for systematic bias and does not consider or account for the substantial random error in smp and nwp datasets this work employs a bias correction scheme in order to compare such an approach with one that considers the full range of precipitation uncertainty both systematic bias and random error the goal of this work is to understand how precipitation uncertainty impacts streamflow estimates with an emphasis on peak streamflow events and assess whether stream presents a suitable way to account for imerg uncertainty and improve predicted streamflow in this work imerg uncertainty is incorporated into the iowa flood center s distributed hydrologic model the hillslope link model hlm using precipitation ensemble fields generated by stream the resulting ensemble of streamflow estimates are compared against usgs observations as well as streamflow estimates from hlm when forced with imerg early a bias corrected version of imerg early and a ground reference product nexrad stage iv lin 2011 unlike previous attempts to account for smp uncertainty namely by using srem2d stream ensembles model the nonstationarity of smp error correlation structures and do not rely on ground reference precipitation data to do so this paper is structured as follows the study area in iowa and precipitation and streamflow datasets are described in section 2 section 3 details the methodology of the hillslope link model and stream and presents the chosen evaluation metrics for streamflow results section 4 presents hlm simulation results using a range of precipitation inputs results and implications of this work are discussed in section 5 2 study area and data 2 1 study area and period the study area comprises the state of iowa roughly 97 w to 90 w 40 n to 44 n including the major river basins of the cedar iowa skunk and des moines rivers that drain into the mississippi river along the eastern border of the state fig 1 c this study area is classified as humid continental on the koppen climate scale covers a range of watersheds and sub watersheds and is comparable to or larger than many study areas used to validate hydrologic performance of smp data e g amorim et al 2020 maggioni et al 2013 nikolopoulos et al 2010 in the past three decades the state has experienced several widespread flooding events with substantial social and economic tolls with the most notable events occurring in 1993 2008 and 2011 lott 1993 mutel 2010 vennapusa white 2015 the study period covers 2008 2013 which includes one of the largest flood events that iowa has experienced in june 2008 budikova et al 2010 smith et al 2013 2 2 precipitation data the nexrad stage iv radar gauge product available over the continental u s conus at an hourly 1 24 resolution lin 2011 is used as the ground reference precipitation product in this work although stage iv is not exempt from errors it has been considered to exhibit negligible uncertainty relative to smp data in previous smp studies e g aghakouchak et al 2011 and is considered highly accurate in this study region quintero et al 2020b nasa s imerg satellite product is available globally from 2000 to present at a half hourly 0 1 resolution in three versions imerg early at a 4 hour latency available in near real time but excluding remote sensing data following a satellite pass imerg late at a 12 hour latency which incorporates additional remote sensing retrievals and imerg final at an approximately 2 5 month latency which assimilates gauge data to improve product accuracy huffman et al 2019 tan et al 2019 in this work imerg early is used because of its low latency and availability for early warning systems imerg early is rescaled to an hourly resolution to match the temporal resolution of stage iv data during calibration of the smp error model required for stream section 3 2 the threshold of detection for all precipitation data in this work is 0 1 mm hour consistent with previous sub daily precipitation studies e g germann zawadzki 2002 li et al 2021 2 3 streamflow data usgs gauge data throughout the state of iowa was used to validate the streamflow estimated by the hillslope link model section 3 1 a total of 192 usgs stations are used periods with missing streamflow data are excluded from analysis fourteen gauge sites which are heavily influenced by reservoir operations or other anthropogenic diversions are also excluded from analysis since the hydrologic model described in section 3 1 does not account for these effects roughly 20 of the resulting 178 gauge sites have an upstream area less than 100 km2 30 of sites have upstream areas between 100 and 1 000 km2 15 of gauge sites have upstream areas greater than 5 000 km2 with the largest upstream area being 32 645 km2 at the des moines river at keosauqua fig 1d 3 methods 3 1 hillslope link model the iowa flood center s hillslope link model is a continuous rainfall runoff model that routes runoff calculated at individual hillslopes fig 1b into links which are connected via channel routing fig 1a krajewski et al 2017 the hlm was developed initially as part of the iowa flood information system ifis demir et al 2018 demir krajewski 2013 krajewski et al 2017 in response to the devastating 2008 flooding in eastern iowa and began operational use in 2012 providing distributed streamflow predictions and a flood potential index quintero et al 2020a every 15 min at sites across the state fig 1c this study uses the same parameters as in the operational model and does not calibrate the hlm model for specific precipitation datasets although the hlm is not a continental or global scale model that utilizes smp or nwp data it shares the objective of other operational forecast models to provide expedient accurate data to prepare communities for potential high flow and flooding events in the hlm the landscape is divided into individual channels and hillslopes based on usgs digital elevation model dem data with a 90 meter resolution rainfall input is partitioned into soil moisture drainage and runoff fluxes the uncertainty in rainfall input data is viewed as one of the largest uncertainty sources for model predictions quintero et al 2020b 3 2 space time rainfall error and autocorrelation model stream the space time rainfall error and autocorrelation model stream was developed to allow pixel scale smp uncertainty estimates to be combined in space and time by simulating the space time autocorrelation structure of smp error using minimal ground reference data hartke et al 2022 the space time correlation structure of an smp field in this application imerg is adopted as the space time correlation structure of smp error at each time step using the python package pysteps and a semi lagrangian advection scheme pulkkinen et al 2019 fig 2 see hartke et al 2022 for further details imerg uncertainty at each pixel and timestep is represented by a distribution that is conditional on an imerg precipitation estimate selecting any value randomly from this conditional distribution produces equally probable values for the true precipitation to generate a field of possible true precipitation values however requires consideration of the correlation between satellite precipitation errors error autocorrelation occurs because the retrieval conditions influencing the imerg error at a given pixel and timestep are likely to also impact imerg estimates in surrounding pixels and timesteps to some extent by stochastically generating uniform noise fields that replicate the autocorrelation structure of imerg fields a proxy for the unknown autocorrelation structure of the imerg error field possible true precipitation values can be selected from conditional distributions to generate precipitation fields which incorporate autocorrelated precipitation errors fig 2 the censored shifted gamma distribution csgd error model and the conditional distributions it generates are further described in section 3 3 as in hartke et al 2022 the csgd error model is used here to generate pixel scale uncertainty distributions for imerg estimates at every time step and pixel in the study area for further information on stream see hartke et al 2022 3 3 the censored shifted gamma distribution error model and a bias corrected imerg the censored shifted gamma distribution error model was first introduced by scheuerer hamill 2015 for post processing of nwp precipitation fields and was adapted by wright et al 2017 to characterize the uncertainty of single satellite precipitation estimates across the continental u s the csgd which is used to describe the uncertainty around a precipitation estimate is an adaptation of the two parameter gamma distribution with an additional shift parameter δ that shifts the probability density function pdf leftward the density left of zero represents the probability of zero precipitation while the density at any value greater than zero represents the likelihood of that amount of precipitation fig 3 c the reparameterized distribution is then left censored at zero replacing all negative values with zero a regression model described by error model parameters α 1 α 2 α 3 and α 4 is trained based on contemporaneous co located smp and ground truth observations the calibrated model generates unique conditional csgd parameters μ t σ t and δ t at any time t as a function of the model parameters and the smp estimate r s t 1 μ t μ c α 1 l o g 1 e x p α 1 1 α 2 α 3 r s t r 2 σ t α 4 σ c μ t μ c 3 δ t δ c where μ c σ c and δ c are the parameters of the climatological csgd calculated using smp data fig 3a and b and r is the mean of smp estimates μ t σ t and δ t are the parameters of a conditional csgd describing the uncertainty around smp estimate r s t fig 3c equations 1 3 describing the csgd are written in terms of its mean and standard deviation but can be reparametrized in terms of shape and scale parameters unique csgd error model parameters can be calibrated for a single location using ground reference and smp timeseries from a single grid cell as done in hartke et al 2020 wright et al 2017 or can be regionalized by calibrating model parameters on timeseries from multiple grid cells while calibrating model parameters for individual grid cells allows error models to reflect smp error characteristics specific to each grid cell regional calibration can be more robust because it provides more data and high precipitation values in particular during training regional calibration is most appropriate in terrain where error characteristics are not expected to vary significantly between neighboring grid cells which is a reasonable assumption in this study area in this application of the stream section 3 2 the csgd error model is trained regionally over 25 0 1 grid cells at a time 5 grid cells wide and 5 grid cells high fig 3a to generate 0 5 scale regional error models this approach ensures that sufficient data is used during model training and that differences in imerg error characteristics are represented across the study region an additional precipitation dataset is generated by selecting the mean value of the conditional distribution generated for each imerg estimate in space and time adjusting the imerg estimate for systematic bias this precipitation dataset removes the systematic long term bias of imerg relative to stage iv and is referred to as bias corrected imerg in the remainder of this work 3 4 experimental set up the hlm is run for april october in 2008 2013 at a 1 hour timestep with the following five precipitation inputs 0 1 imerg 0 1 stage iv 1 24 stage iv 0 1 stream ensemble fields section 3 2 and a 0 1 bias corrected imerg field section 3 3 all precipitation inputs produce deterministic streamflow estimates except the stream ensemble fields which produce an ensemble of streamflow estimates two resolutions of stage iv precipitation are used so that the coarser 0 1 product bilinearly interpolated from the native 1 24 resolution product matches the resolution of imerg and any differences between the performance of the two stage iv products can be attributed to the resolution of the precipitation data the first month of the hlm simulation in each year april is discarded as a spin up period and may october is used for evaluation 3 5 streamflow peak event identification in order to assess hlm streamflow performance during high flow events we identify peak events using the wavelet based event identification method proposed in towler mccreight 2021 and liu et al 2011 this method assesses the statistical significance of the spectral power jumps that large streamflow events represent when the entire streamflow record is transformed into spectral space using a wavelet transform which creates a representation of the signal in both the time and frequency domain fig 4 a c we assessed the power spectrum averaged over the 1 8 day period to find statistically significant events at this scale wavelet based event identification is advantageous because it allows comparison of peak event characteristics peak flow flow volume event duration without the complication of timing errors intermittent periods with missing data in usgs gauge records are linearly interpolated for the purposes of event identification and calculation of total event volume after identifying events at each gauge site using observed usgs streamflow fig 4d the peak event flow and total event volume are calculated for the five largest events as determined by event volume using the observed streamflow and the simulated streamflow obtained by forcing hlm with all precipitation datasets at almost every gauge site the top five identified events included events during june 2008 and june 2013 the mean absolute error mae of imerg and stage iv simulations and mean continuous ranked probability score mcrps described in section 3 6 of stream simulations are calculated for peak flow and event volume at these events 3 6 performance metrics the normalized root mean squared error nrmse also referred to as the relative rmse falck et al 2015 is calculated for imerg based and stage iv based streamflow as well as for the mean of the stream based streamflow ensemble 4 nrmse 1 n t 1 n q t q t 2 1 n t 1 n q t where q t is the observed streamflow and q t is the predicted streamflow at timestep t the mean absolute error mae for deterministic streamflow estimates and the mean continuous ranked probability score mcrps for streamflow ensembles are calculated the continuous ranked probability score of an ensemble streamflow estimate is analogous to the absolute error of a single streamflow estimate and reduces to the absolute error as the ensemble size decreases to one therefore the mcrps of a probabilistic streamflow timeseries is analogous to the mae of a deterministic timeseries allowing for comparison of performance between probabilistic and deterministic streamflow predictions 5 mae 1 n t 1 n q t q t 6 mcrps 1 n t 1 n r f q t i q t q t 2 d q t where f q t is the forecasted distribution of streamflow in this case an ensemble rather than an explicit distribution and i is an indicator function the ideal value for nrmse mae and mcrps is 0 and higher values indicate worse performance the containing ratio cr is the proportion of observed streamflow data which lies within the range of the streamflow ensemble generated using stream precipitation ensembles this probabilistic performance metric and its counterpart the exceedance ratio er have been used by previous work in the satellite precipitation hydrologic modeling and forecast verification communities to assess ensemble performance e g franz hogue 2011 hartke et al 2022 maggioni et al 2013 xiong o connor 2008 7 cr 1 n t 1 n i q t where the indicator function i is equal to one when q t is bracketed by the minimum and maximum values of the predicted streamflow ensemble at timestep t and is equal to zero when q t lies outside the ensemble the ideal value for cr is 1 indicating that the ensemble brackets observed streamflow in every instance while the poorest performance would be indicated by a value of 0 the uncertainty ratio ur is the ratio between ensemble spread and the corresponding observed streamflow at each timestep and has been used in previous studies of probabilistic streamflow and soil moisture falck et al 2015 maggioni et al 2011 8 ur t 1 n q t max q t min t 1 n q t the ur can vary between 0 and infinity with lower values indicating lower ensemble spread relative to observed streamflow a high cr and low ur are ideal for ensemble predictions because this indicates that an ensemble is consistently bracketing observations while maintaining a small ensemble spread relative to observed streamflow values periods with missing data in usgs gauge records are excluded when calculating the above performance metrics 4 results fig 5 illustrates differences between the precipitation products used in this work by comparing the june 6 12 2008 cumulative precipitation preceding a major flood event imerg substantially overestimates total rainfall especially across southwestern iowa but correctly estimates over 150 mm of cumulative rainfall in northeastern iowa this is consistent with findings that imerg early tends to overestimate extreme precipitation in this part of the world li et al 2022 bias corrected imerg adjusts for imerg s systematic overestimation resulting in lower total rainfall in the southeast while estimating high totals in the northeast the mean of the stream ensemble looks generally similar to the bias corrected imerg field the visible 5 by 5 pixel blocks in the bias corrected and mean stream fields are artifacts of the regional csgd error model training scheme described in section 3 3 and represent the differences in 0 5 regional error models across the study area two randomly selected stream ensemble members in fig 5 demonstrate two of the scenarios that stream generates for possible true precipitation these fields correctly estimate high total rainfall in the northeast although with variation due to different representations of possible imerg random error and better match the spatial structure of the stage iv cumulative field than imerg does 4 1 performance of hlm streamflow estimates fig 6 shows the containing ratio cr of the streamflow ensemble generated using stream ensemble precipitation input and the percent reduction in mae of the imerg based streamflow when compared to the mcrps of the stream based streamflow ensemble the cr of the stream based streamflow ensemble varies across the study area but is consistently high in watersheds in eastern and western iowa lower cr values in the des moines lobe landform in central iowa correspond to an area where the hlm configuration has low performance mainly because the model does not account for changes in infiltration and flow due to agricultural tile drainage systems quintero et al 2020a b the mcrps of the stream based streamflow ensemble is lower than the mae of imerg based streamflow across all watersheds reducing the mae by up to 80 in some locations fig 7 plots the nrmse mae and mcrps of imerg stage iv and stream based streamflow estimates the cr and ur of the stream based ensemble are also presented in panels c and d stage iv based streamflow generally exhibits the lowest error however the stream based streamflow exhibits errors nearly as low as that of stage iv based streamflow and much lower than that of the imerg based simulations mae and mcrps increase with upstream area which is expected since streamflow magnitudes are greater in bigger basins the reduction in mcrps relative to mae by stream based streamflow estimates increases substantially with basin size the stream based streamflow ensemble exhibits a mcrps 50 lower than the mae of imerg based streamflow estimates at gauge sites with upstream areas greater than 10 000 km2 except for basins less than 100 km2 the cr of stream simulations generally increases with upstream area when basins less than 100 km2 the size of a single imerg pixel are excluded while the ur of the stream ensemble consistently decreases with upstream area the large ensemble spreads in small basins reflected by high ur may be due to the limitations of hydrological models in simulating fast hydrological responses in small basins when remote sensing products such as imerg are too coarse to capture nimmo et al 2021 széles et al 2020 fig 8 displays the mcrps and cr of stream based streamflow ensembles as a function of ensemble size and upstream area ensemble members were chosen at random to generate this plot mcrps generally decreases and cr generally increases with increasing ensemble size as shown previously in fig 5 mcrps increases with upstream area mcrps decreases with ensemble size in basins less than 4500 km2 in size until an ensemble size of 10 is reached after which the mcrps appears to stabilize in basins larger than 4500 km2 a larger ensemble appears to improve mcrps until an ensemble size of 20 is reached the cr demonstrates greater change with ensemble size for all basin sizes the cr continuously increases with ensemble size and basins less than 100 km2 greater than 2000 km2 in size eventually level out at a cr of approximately 0 6 0 55 the upstream area range that consistently has the lowest cr is 100 750 km2 4 2 performance of hlm streamflow estimates during extreme flow events fig 9 illustrates observed and simulated hlm streamflow during identified peak flow events at three gauges the cedar river at cedar rapids 16 814 km2 the iowa river at lone tree 11 114 km2 and east nishnabotna river at red oak 2 323 km2 visual comparison of observed and simulated streamflow reveals that stage iv based estimates generally match observations leading up to and during high flow events however even though stage iv precipitation data is relatively accurate stage iv based streamflow peaks often lag behind observed peaks indicating a timing error in the hydrologic model further stage iv based streamflow does not agree with observed streamflow during the recession period e g late june 2008 at the cedar river in fig 9 in almost all high flow events illustrated in fig 9 imerg based streamflow overestimates the actual streamflow sometimes by a considerable margin as could be expected from imerg s overestimation of precipitation as seen in fig 5 the stream simulation mean generally matches stage iv and observations more than imerg and the 90 confidence interval brackets the observed streamflow at almost all timesteps during increasing and peak flows the stream 90 ci is widest during periods when imerg uncertainty is high and imerg based streamflow estimates correspondingly exhibit high error e g the 2010 event in fig 9 all hlm simulations exhibit a tendency to underestimate streamflow during the recession period following peak events note that the plateau in usgs observed streamflow during the 2013 event at lone tree is likely due to reservoir operations approximately twenty miles upstream at coralville dam the mae of imerg and stage iv based streamflow and mcrps of stream based streamflow ensembles when estimating the peak flow event volume and event duration calculated for the largest ten events during the study period at each gauge are shown in fig 10 a c as with the mae and mcrps for estimating streamflow the mae and mcrps for estimated peak flow and event volume increase with upstream basin area the mcrps of stream based peak flow estimates is substantially reduced relative to the mae of imerg based peak flow at gauge locations with upstream areas greater than 1 000 km2 the accuracy of event volume predictions does not improve as much as the accuracy of peak flow when predicted using the stream ensemble instead of imerg the relative error in estimated peak flow event volume and event duration for identified events at 97 gauge stations in june 2008 and 101 gauge stations in june 2013 are shown in fig 10d f and fig 10g i respectively as found in quintero et al 2020b errors in peak flow estimation increase with upstream area fig 10d 10 g the relative error is calculated for the mean of stream simulations imerg consistently overestimates peak flow across all sites during the 2008 event while stage iv estimates are much closer to observed values while stage iv and stream consistently outperform imerg when the top 10 events are considered results are more varied when individual events during june 2008 and 2013 are examined while stream improves on peak flow estimates in the largest basins it shows slightly higher error than imerg and stage iv when estimating total event volume during these events note that no results for basins less than 100 km2 in area are shown for the individual june 2008 and 2013 events due to few basins of that size detecting an event during those periods 4 3 effect of precipitation uncertainty precipitation resolution and bias correction fig 11 presents the proportion of streamflow error here in terms of mae that can be attributed to different precipitation sources sorted by upstream area fig 11a shows the percent reduction in mae from imerg based streamflow to streamflow forced by more accurate stage iv data at 0 1 resolution and at native resolution the percentage of streamflow mae attributable to imerg uncertainty increases with upstream area and ranges from 20 to 40 of mae on average across basin sizes in some basins this percentage is as high as 60 fig 10b compares the percent reduction of imerg based streamflow mae when compared to bias corrected imerg yellow described in section 3 3 and the stream ensemble simulations magenta the reduction in streamflow mae is consistently higher across basin sizes when using the stream ensemble instead of bias corrected imerg to force the hlm in some basins using bias corrected imerg to predict streamflow actually increases the mae of predicted streamflow relative to imerg unlike the stream based streamflow estimates streamflow based on bias corrected imerg appears to perform worse relative to imerg as the upstream area increases at gauge sites although fig 11b is calculated using all streamflow estimates supplemental fig 2 shows the same analysis for the highest 10 of streamflow observations at each gauge site 5 discussion 5 1 performance of hlm streamflow estimates overall and during peak flow events across study results use of the stream ensemble to force the hlm hydrologic model improves streamflow performance to nearly the same degree as use of ground reference data relative to the satellite multisensor product imerg results that demonstrate greater relative improvement in mae in large basins when using stream ensemble fields to force the hlm fig 7 fig 11 correspond to results in falck et al 2018 which found greater reduction in random error at large basin scales in brazil while the error in streamflow estimates improves when precipitation uncertainty is accounted for across basin sizes figs 7 9 and 11 the notably greater reduction in mcrps relative to mae in large basins demonstrates the importance of accounting for precipitation uncertainty in hydrologic models for basins greater than 10 000 km2 in size figs 6 and 7 that stream based simulations exhibit nrmse and mcrps nearly as low as that of stage iv based simulations across all gauge sites figs 6 and 10 demonstrates that stream effectively captures the range of true precipitation and substantially reduces the effects of precipitation uncertainty on hlm output notably this is contingent on both the ability of stream to simulate the space time autocorrelation structure of errors as well as the ability of the csgd error model to provide apt uncertainty characterizations for every imerg estimate improved streamflow prediction using the stream ensemble supports previous work demonstrating the advantages of ensemble based probabilistic flood forecasting e g cloke pappenberger 2009 verbunt et al 2007 the stream ensemble outperforms bias corrected imerg because firstly the bias corrected product cannot simulate extreme rain rates while it is correcting for the systematic tendency of imerg to overestimate moderate to high precipitation events furthermore bias corrected imerg cannot simulate high rain rates over multiple pixels e g autocorrelated errors in a watershed which leads to heavy underestimation of streamflow in instances when high rain rates are in fact occurring across a watershed it is also interesting that imerg based streamflow does not always fall within the stream ensemble range especially during peak flows see fig 9 supplemental fig 1 this occurs when imerg overestimates precipitation over multiple pixels and the stream methodology generates precipitation fields that may contain some high rain rates or a similar area of precipitation but that depict lower precipitation overall across a region essentially during process of correcting for systematic bias simulating the range of random error and simulating error autocorrelation structures stream recognizes that such a large area of extreme rainfall observed by imerg is statistically very unlikely to correspond to such extreme true rainfall thus no ensemble members are generated that predict this high regional precipitation as the possible true rainfall the resulting streamflow forced by the stream ensemble does not always bracket the imerg based simulation e g july 2010 at cedar rapids in fig 9 but it is clear that stream is correct in generally reducing precipitation rates the stream ensemble replicates the stage iv simulation and observations more than imerg fig 9 supplemental fig 1 the decreasing ur and increasing cr of the stream based streamflow ensemble with upstream area may be due to smaller relative uncertainties uc in larger basins as in falck et al 2015 maggioni et al 2013 these ur and cr trends also demonstrate that the higher cr in larger basins is not due to a significantly larger ensemble spread relative to the average streamflow these results are consistent with previous findings by falck et al 2015 which also found ur to decrease with increasing upstream area in brazil additionally it could be expected that basins with upstream areas less than 100 km2 perform differently than larger basins e g fig 7c because the runoff in these basins is based on imerg estimates from a single pixel in watersheds smaller than the area of an imerg pixel the spatial autocorrelation of errors in multiple pixels does not impact the total watershed precipitation decreasing performance of bias corrected imerg predictions with upstream area fig 11b supplemental fig 2b indicates that basins in this study area are not effectively filtering out precipitation random error otherwise larger basin areas should correspond to better performance of streamflow predictions generated by imerg and bias corrected imerg that stream based predictions meanwhile improve in performance with upstream area fig 11b supplemental fig 2b indicates that 1 autocorrelation of random errors has a substantial impact on the propagation of precipitation error in the hlm and 2 stream effectively simulates such autocorrelation structures the containing ratio and mcrps show consistent improvement with increasing ensemble size until approximately an ensemble size of approximately 30 fig 8 in small basins fewer ensemble members are required which is intuitive given the limited variety of potential true precipitation fields that an ensemble generates for basins covered by only a handful of imerg pixels however in large basins where there are more possible combinations of precipitation error and error autocorrelation structures more realizations of possible true precipitation fields are required to capture observed streamflow the hillslope link model was designed principally to monitor high streamflow conditions that may endanger communities and infrastructure in iowa it is therefore not unexpected that its streamflow estimates during low flow conditions do not consistently match usgs observations see fig 8 quintero et al 2020a b the inaccuracy in hlm streamflow estimates during low flow conditions or recessions after peak events when the high quality stage iv product is used e g fig 8 provides reasonable grounds to conclude that poor streamflow accuracy at low flows is more due to structural or parameter error within hlm rather than problems with the precipitation visual inspection of hydrographs also reveals timing errors in predicted peak streamflow events june 2008 at east nishnabotna river in fig 9 such errors can be attributed to either the hlm or insufficient temporal resolution of precipitation forcing data but not to precipitation uncertainty since even the high accuracy ground reference precipitation dataset fails to generate correct timing of peak streamflow in some instances while these results have been produced and analyzed over the central u s using the hillslope link model we believe that other geographic regions would also demonstrate better performance when using ground reference data rather than smp estimates the extent to which stream precipitation ensembles improve on imerg based simulations of streamflow may vary with the climate terrain and rainfall runoff mechanisms which dominate other regions it could be expected that stream continues to improve streamflow predictions in large basins where autocorrelated errors in smp data impact streamflow estimates additionally although all available 2005 2007 stage iv data is used to train the csgd error model in the stream framework supplemental fig 3 demonstrates the impact of reduced ground reference training data on the csgd error model and resulting stream ensemble the 2005 2007 imerg and stage iv timeseries from five randomly selected pixels are used to train regional csgd error models for six 2 5 regions covering the study area the resulting 2 5 or 25 by 25 pixel regional error models present a coarser characterization of imerg error than the 0 5 regional error models trained in the original csgd error model scheme section 3 3 this data limited error characterization uses roughly 1 of the training data used in the original error models e g 5 pixels instead of 25 25 625 pixels for a 2 5 area the climatological mean precipitation based on this limited stage iv dataset although at a coarser 2 5 scale replicates the pattern obtained when training 0 5 regional models supplemental fig 3a and 3b most importantly a randomly selected ensemble member generated by stream using the original and the limited csgd error model but the same random noise field is nearly indistinguishable supplemental fig 3c and 3d the stream ensemble mean using both csgd error modeling approaches is also nearly identical supplemental fig 3e and 3f this shows that the csgd error model can be calibrated using quite minimal ground reference data and produce similarly performing stream ensembles as when trained with abundant ground reference data 5 2 effect of precipitation uncertainty precipitation resolution and bias correction a sizeable percentage between 20 and 40 on average across basin sizes of the error in predicted streamflow using imerg data can be attributed to errors in this precipitation data product fig 11a the minimal difference in mae reduction when using 1 24 and 0 1 resolution stage iv demonstrates that uncertainty in precipitation data makes a larger contribution towards the error in simulated streamflow than does this resolution difference of the precipitation data coarser resolution stage iv improves predicted streamflow accuracy slightly more that native resolution stage iv except in the largest basins fig 11a when only the top 10 of streamflow observations are considered however native resolution stage iv outperforms the coarser resolution product in all basin size categories except those less than 100 km2 supplemental fig 2 the ability of coarser ground reference data to estimate streamflow with a slightly lower mae than 1 24 resolution ground reference data is most likely due to sampling error several of the usgs gauge sites for basins in this study only have available data for two or three of the years in the six years study period correcting for systematic bias does not account for random error which is a substantial component of overall imerg and other smp product uncertainty fig 11b during all flows and particularly during the highest subset of streamflow across gauge sites streamflow error is consistently reduced more when the stream ensemble is used as input to the hlm rather than the bias corrected imerg dataset this demonstrates the inadequacy of bias correction as an approach to addressing precipitation uncertainty in hydrologic models like the hlm and supports similar findings in habib et al 2014 and hartke et al 2020 regarding smp uncertainty in runoff simulations and landslide hazard applications respectively 6 summary and conclusions although satellite multisensor precipitation products and numerical weather model fields have made possible near real time hydrologic modeling on a continental to global scale in recent decades streamflow estimates are hampered by the uncertainty in precipitation data from these sources overestimation underestimation and incorrect detection of precipitation all lead to less accurate estimates of runoff and streamflow in hydrologic models the magnitude of precipitation error propagation varies across watersheds but is particularly variable in semi arid regions and other settings where the rainfall runoff generation processes are highly nonlinear although hydrologic model calibration may reduce the propagation of forcing data uncertainty it is no substitute for explicitly representing the uncertainty in forcing precipitation data which includes substantial random error in addition to systematic bias however this effort is complicated by the need to simulate the autocorrelation structure of precipitation errors in order to capture basin scale precipitation uncertainty while minimizing reliance on ground references and representing precipitation uncertainty in a way that hydrologic models or other applications with deterministic inputs can readily ingest in this paper precipitation ensembles generated by the space time rainfall error and autocorrelation model stream are used to force the hillslope link model and simulate streamflow ensembles which reflect the uncertainty in precipitation forcing from imerg using stream ensembles substantially reduces the error in streamflow estimates overall and during peak flow events often approaching the performance of streamflow simulations forced by a ground reference precipitation product results show that a substantial portion of the error between predicted and observed streamflow as much as 60 when modeled using the hillslope link hydrologic model in the central u s is due to the error in imerg correcting for systematic bias while neglecting the range of random error is shown to be an insufficient approach to addressing precipitation uncertainty and can actually worsen streamflow predictions results also reemphasize the results of cunha et al 2012 that the spatial autocorrelation of precipitation errors heavily impacts the ability of basins to filter out precipitation uncertainty although stream is applied to smp data in this work and in hartke et al 2022 it is also applicable to numerical weather prediction nwp model fields additionally although the error characterization in this work utilizes a ground reference product for calibration recent work by li et al 2021 demonstrates a method for characterizing satellite precipitation uncertainty using dual precipitation radar data this will allow stream to generate precipitation ensembles to represent satellite precipitation uncertainty anywhere in the world without ground reference data future work will use a similar methodology as demonstrated in this work to account for satellite precipitation uncertainty in hydrologic modeling on a continental to global scale without reliance on any ground based precipitation data credit authorship

8538,in global applications and data sparse regions which comprise most of the earth hydrologic model based flood monitoring relies on precipitation data from satellite multisensor precipitation products or numerical weather forecasts however these products often exhibit substantial errors during the meteorological conditions that lead to flooding including extreme rainfall the propagation of precipitation forcing errors to predicted runoff and streamflow is scale dependent and requires an understanding of the autocorrelation structure of precipitation errors since error autocorrelation impacts the accumulation of precipitation errors over space and time in hydrologic models previous efforts to account for satellite precipitation uncertainty in hydrologic models have demonstrated the potential for improving streamflow estimates however these efforts use satellite precipitation error models that rely heavily on ground reference data such as rain gages or weather radar and do not characterize the nonstationarity of precipitation error autocorrelation structures this work evaluates a new method the space time rainfall error and autocorrelation model stream which stochastically generates possible true precipitation fields as input to the hillslope link model to generate ensemble streamflow estimates unlike previous error models stream represents the nonstationary and anisotropic autocorrelation structure of satellite precipitation error and does not use any ground reference to do so ensemble streamflow predictions are compared with streamflow generated using satellite precipitation fields as well as a radar gage precipitation dataset during peak flow events results demonstrate that this approach to accounting for precipitation uncertainty effectively characterizes the uncertainty in streamflow estimates and reduces the error of predicted streamflow streamflow ensembles forced by stream improve streamflow prediction nearly to the level obtained using ground reference forcing data across basin sizes keywords satellite methods precipitation catchment dynamics uncertainty data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 motivation hydrologic models are central to efforts to mitigate the devastating impacts of floods and are used around the world to predict streamflow with particular interest in high streamflow events that cause flooding e g alfieri et al 2013 wu et al 2014 despite continual advances these models cannot perfectly predict streamflow for a number of reasons in addition to model uncertainty i e imperfect representation of physical processes and parameter uncertainty forcing uncertainty due to errors in rainfall data whether obtained from gauge data radar numerical weather prediction model nwp forecasts or satellite multi sensor precipitation smp products leads to errors in runoff and streamflow estimates hong et al 2006 sperna weiland et al 2015 in global hydrologic modeling studies precipitation forcing data has been found to be the primary driver of predictive uncertainty and using parameter calibration to compensate for biases in meteorological forcing data can actually result in inconsistent performance between calibration and evaluation periods leading to calls for improved characterization of global rainfall amounts at spatial resolutions of 0 5 and smaller fekete et al 2004 sperna weiland et al 2015 precipitation uncertainty in basins in high latitudes and the tropics leads to hydrologic uncertainty of the same or greater magnitudes due to the relatively moist soil conditions and propensity of rainfall to become runoff in these regions biemans et al 2009 fekete et al 2004 precipitation error propagation is more variable in semi arid regions where the rainfall runoff generation processes are highly nonlinear fekete et al 2004 initial and simulated soil moisture conditions in watersheds which are also critical to accurate streamflow prediction are dependent on multiple previous precipitation events alvarez garreton et al 2014 tramblay et al 2010 tramblay et al 2011 the issue of precipitation uncertainty in streamflow prediction is particularly prevalent in regional to global scale efforts which due to lack of alternatives typically must rely on either precipitation from satellites or numerical weather models both of which are prone to substantially larger errors than in situ gage measurements examples include the global flood monitoring system gfms wu et al 2014 and the global flood awareness system glofas alfieri et al 2013 these use nasa s integrated multisatellite retrieval for the global measurement mission imerg and the ecmwf integrated forecast system efs data respectively to generate global streamflow predictions similar to other satellite multi sensor precipitation products imerg precipitation estimates exhibit considerable systematic bias and random error and imerg often overestimates rainfall during extreme precipitation events e g anjum et al 2018 asong et al 2017 gilewski nawalany 2018 omranian et al 2018 wang et al 2017 a number of studies have demonstrated that imerg can introduce large uncertainties into streamflow predictions when compared with gauge based or radar gauge products although the extent to which imerg based results underperform varies amorim et al 2020 jiang bauer gottwein 2019 li et al 2016 for instance imerg forced streamflow predictions across china were shown to exhibit substantially more error in arid watersheds than humid watersheds jiang et al 2019 for a thorough review of the use of satellite multi sensor precipitation smp products in hydrologic modeling see quintero et al 2016 hydrologic modeling is not the only satellite precipitation application that contends with satellite precipitation uncertainty land surface modeling snow simulations groundwater modeling and landslide hazard assessment are also susceptible to errors in output when ingesting erroneous precipitation data e g hartke et al 2020 maggioni et al 2011 marc et al 2022 pradhan indu 2021 raleigh et al 2015 schreiner mcgraw ajami 2020 serpetzoglou et al 2010 shrestha et al 2020 although this work focuses on accounting for uncertainty in smp data numerical weather prediction model nwp precipitation fields also exhibit similar levels of bias and random error including high uncertainties during extreme events due to a highly dynamic atmosphere and the sensitivity of model precipitation forecasts to a range of model parameters e g lowrey yang 2008 luitel et al 2018 moosavi et al 2021 nasrollahi et al 2012 nogueira 2020 1 2 precipitation error modeling background within hydrologic models runoff is accumulated over a range of basin sizes and precipitation error propagation is dependent on both basin scale as well as the autocorrelation of precipitation errors in space and time cunha et al 2012 nijssen lettenmaier 2004 nikolopoulos et al 2010 error autocorrelation describes the intuitive fact that an overestimation of precipitation by imerg at a pixel in a given timestep likely corresponds to an overestimation by imerg in surrounding pixels and timesteps while accumulation during rainfall runoff generation processes can serve to average out random errors in precipitation datasets it can also serve to accumulate a field of precipitation with correlated errors i e precipitation being overestimated over an entire storm system and propagate these into streamflow predictions cunha et al 2012 found the efficiency of the river basin in filtering out random errors to be highly sensitive to the presence of spatial correlation in errors and that when rainfall errors are correlated in space the process of aggregation and attenuation by the river network is not as effective in filtering out uncertainties correctly simulating the autocorrelation of precipitation error fields is paramount to capturing precipitation uncertainty at coarser scales e g basin scales hartke et al 2022 just like the correlation structure of precipitation the correlation structure of precipitation error fields is anisotropic and nonstationary in time and space changing depending on the observed precipitation system and retrieval conditions i e errors may exhibit lower spatial autocorrelation during a scattered precipitation event than during a larger and more highly spatially autocorrelated frontal precipitation event a number of smp error models have been introduced that generate distributions to describe the uncertainty surrounding a given smp estimate at a single time and pixel i e kirstetter et al 2018 maggioni et al 2014 wright et al 2017 see section 3 3 one of the major limitations of these pixel scale error formulations is that they do not relate the uncertainty of smp estimates across space and time there is no intuitive way to combine the uncertainty distributions at every pixel in a field to create an ensemble of precipitation error fields previous work has attempted to link pixel scale precipitation uncertainty estimates using calibrated correlation coefficients or lengths to quantify the space time autocorrelation structure of errors e g ciach et al 2007 hossain anagnostou 2006 but such approaches do not represent the nonstationarity of satellite precipitation errors and rely on ground reference data for calibration previous studies on ensemble smp error correction in hydrologic modeling have utilized the two dimensional satellite rainfall error model srem2d hossain anagnostou 2006 which does not account for the nonstationarity and anisotropy of smp error correlation structures falck et al 2015 2018 2021 maggioni et al 2013 these studies demonstrate that the inclusion of precipitation uncertainty using ensemble methods does generally improve streamflow prediction although not always in large basins when an error model applies bias correction to entire basin areas as shown with srem2d in falck et al 2015 but do so using an approach that is not viable for most of the world due to a scarcity of ground based data which is unlikely to change 1 3 incorporating satellite precipitation uncertainty into hydrologic modeling accounting for precipitation uncertainty in hydrologic modeling applications poses a challenge because of the probabilistic nature of precipitation uncertainty the nonstationary correlation structure of precipitation errors and the need to calibrate precipitation uncertainty models with little to no ground reference data in many parts of the world the space time rainfall error and autocorrelation model stream was developed with an eye to overcoming these challenges hartke et al 2022 stream stochastically generates a precipitation ensemble that represents the possible true precipitation based on a satellite precipitation field or a numerical weather forecast it consists of two pieces 1 using an uncalibrated nonstationary error autocorrelation scheme that requires no ground reference data and 2 pixel scale uncertainty estimates that can be obtained from existing error model formulations by not calibrating the autocorrelation scheme on historical ground reference or smp error fields and instead replicating the changing anisotropic autocorrelation structure of smp fields stream nimbly incorporates nonstationarity into its representation of smp uncertainty like previous ensemble based approaches stream ensembles can be ingested by smp applications including hydrologic models without any modification to the model structure one strategy to address precipitation uncertainty in hydrologic modeling is bias correction e g charles et al 2020 ciupak et al 2019 habib et al 2014 ji et al 2020 however when applied in near real time this approach only adjusts for systematic bias and does not consider or account for the substantial random error in smp and nwp datasets this work employs a bias correction scheme in order to compare such an approach with one that considers the full range of precipitation uncertainty both systematic bias and random error the goal of this work is to understand how precipitation uncertainty impacts streamflow estimates with an emphasis on peak streamflow events and assess whether stream presents a suitable way to account for imerg uncertainty and improve predicted streamflow in this work imerg uncertainty is incorporated into the iowa flood center s distributed hydrologic model the hillslope link model hlm using precipitation ensemble fields generated by stream the resulting ensemble of streamflow estimates are compared against usgs observations as well as streamflow estimates from hlm when forced with imerg early a bias corrected version of imerg early and a ground reference product nexrad stage iv lin 2011 unlike previous attempts to account for smp uncertainty namely by using srem2d stream ensembles model the nonstationarity of smp error correlation structures and do not rely on ground reference precipitation data to do so this paper is structured as follows the study area in iowa and precipitation and streamflow datasets are described in section 2 section 3 details the methodology of the hillslope link model and stream and presents the chosen evaluation metrics for streamflow results section 4 presents hlm simulation results using a range of precipitation inputs results and implications of this work are discussed in section 5 2 study area and data 2 1 study area and period the study area comprises the state of iowa roughly 97 w to 90 w 40 n to 44 n including the major river basins of the cedar iowa skunk and des moines rivers that drain into the mississippi river along the eastern border of the state fig 1 c this study area is classified as humid continental on the koppen climate scale covers a range of watersheds and sub watersheds and is comparable to or larger than many study areas used to validate hydrologic performance of smp data e g amorim et al 2020 maggioni et al 2013 nikolopoulos et al 2010 in the past three decades the state has experienced several widespread flooding events with substantial social and economic tolls with the most notable events occurring in 1993 2008 and 2011 lott 1993 mutel 2010 vennapusa white 2015 the study period covers 2008 2013 which includes one of the largest flood events that iowa has experienced in june 2008 budikova et al 2010 smith et al 2013 2 2 precipitation data the nexrad stage iv radar gauge product available over the continental u s conus at an hourly 1 24 resolution lin 2011 is used as the ground reference precipitation product in this work although stage iv is not exempt from errors it has been considered to exhibit negligible uncertainty relative to smp data in previous smp studies e g aghakouchak et al 2011 and is considered highly accurate in this study region quintero et al 2020b nasa s imerg satellite product is available globally from 2000 to present at a half hourly 0 1 resolution in three versions imerg early at a 4 hour latency available in near real time but excluding remote sensing data following a satellite pass imerg late at a 12 hour latency which incorporates additional remote sensing retrievals and imerg final at an approximately 2 5 month latency which assimilates gauge data to improve product accuracy huffman et al 2019 tan et al 2019 in this work imerg early is used because of its low latency and availability for early warning systems imerg early is rescaled to an hourly resolution to match the temporal resolution of stage iv data during calibration of the smp error model required for stream section 3 2 the threshold of detection for all precipitation data in this work is 0 1 mm hour consistent with previous sub daily precipitation studies e g germann zawadzki 2002 li et al 2021 2 3 streamflow data usgs gauge data throughout the state of iowa was used to validate the streamflow estimated by the hillslope link model section 3 1 a total of 192 usgs stations are used periods with missing streamflow data are excluded from analysis fourteen gauge sites which are heavily influenced by reservoir operations or other anthropogenic diversions are also excluded from analysis since the hydrologic model described in section 3 1 does not account for these effects roughly 20 of the resulting 178 gauge sites have an upstream area less than 100 km2 30 of sites have upstream areas between 100 and 1 000 km2 15 of gauge sites have upstream areas greater than 5 000 km2 with the largest upstream area being 32 645 km2 at the des moines river at keosauqua fig 1d 3 methods 3 1 hillslope link model the iowa flood center s hillslope link model is a continuous rainfall runoff model that routes runoff calculated at individual hillslopes fig 1b into links which are connected via channel routing fig 1a krajewski et al 2017 the hlm was developed initially as part of the iowa flood information system ifis demir et al 2018 demir krajewski 2013 krajewski et al 2017 in response to the devastating 2008 flooding in eastern iowa and began operational use in 2012 providing distributed streamflow predictions and a flood potential index quintero et al 2020a every 15 min at sites across the state fig 1c this study uses the same parameters as in the operational model and does not calibrate the hlm model for specific precipitation datasets although the hlm is not a continental or global scale model that utilizes smp or nwp data it shares the objective of other operational forecast models to provide expedient accurate data to prepare communities for potential high flow and flooding events in the hlm the landscape is divided into individual channels and hillslopes based on usgs digital elevation model dem data with a 90 meter resolution rainfall input is partitioned into soil moisture drainage and runoff fluxes the uncertainty in rainfall input data is viewed as one of the largest uncertainty sources for model predictions quintero et al 2020b 3 2 space time rainfall error and autocorrelation model stream the space time rainfall error and autocorrelation model stream was developed to allow pixel scale smp uncertainty estimates to be combined in space and time by simulating the space time autocorrelation structure of smp error using minimal ground reference data hartke et al 2022 the space time correlation structure of an smp field in this application imerg is adopted as the space time correlation structure of smp error at each time step using the python package pysteps and a semi lagrangian advection scheme pulkkinen et al 2019 fig 2 see hartke et al 2022 for further details imerg uncertainty at each pixel and timestep is represented by a distribution that is conditional on an imerg precipitation estimate selecting any value randomly from this conditional distribution produces equally probable values for the true precipitation to generate a field of possible true precipitation values however requires consideration of the correlation between satellite precipitation errors error autocorrelation occurs because the retrieval conditions influencing the imerg error at a given pixel and timestep are likely to also impact imerg estimates in surrounding pixels and timesteps to some extent by stochastically generating uniform noise fields that replicate the autocorrelation structure of imerg fields a proxy for the unknown autocorrelation structure of the imerg error field possible true precipitation values can be selected from conditional distributions to generate precipitation fields which incorporate autocorrelated precipitation errors fig 2 the censored shifted gamma distribution csgd error model and the conditional distributions it generates are further described in section 3 3 as in hartke et al 2022 the csgd error model is used here to generate pixel scale uncertainty distributions for imerg estimates at every time step and pixel in the study area for further information on stream see hartke et al 2022 3 3 the censored shifted gamma distribution error model and a bias corrected imerg the censored shifted gamma distribution error model was first introduced by scheuerer hamill 2015 for post processing of nwp precipitation fields and was adapted by wright et al 2017 to characterize the uncertainty of single satellite precipitation estimates across the continental u s the csgd which is used to describe the uncertainty around a precipitation estimate is an adaptation of the two parameter gamma distribution with an additional shift parameter δ that shifts the probability density function pdf leftward the density left of zero represents the probability of zero precipitation while the density at any value greater than zero represents the likelihood of that amount of precipitation fig 3 c the reparameterized distribution is then left censored at zero replacing all negative values with zero a regression model described by error model parameters α 1 α 2 α 3 and α 4 is trained based on contemporaneous co located smp and ground truth observations the calibrated model generates unique conditional csgd parameters μ t σ t and δ t at any time t as a function of the model parameters and the smp estimate r s t 1 μ t μ c α 1 l o g 1 e x p α 1 1 α 2 α 3 r s t r 2 σ t α 4 σ c μ t μ c 3 δ t δ c where μ c σ c and δ c are the parameters of the climatological csgd calculated using smp data fig 3a and b and r is the mean of smp estimates μ t σ t and δ t are the parameters of a conditional csgd describing the uncertainty around smp estimate r s t fig 3c equations 1 3 describing the csgd are written in terms of its mean and standard deviation but can be reparametrized in terms of shape and scale parameters unique csgd error model parameters can be calibrated for a single location using ground reference and smp timeseries from a single grid cell as done in hartke et al 2020 wright et al 2017 or can be regionalized by calibrating model parameters on timeseries from multiple grid cells while calibrating model parameters for individual grid cells allows error models to reflect smp error characteristics specific to each grid cell regional calibration can be more robust because it provides more data and high precipitation values in particular during training regional calibration is most appropriate in terrain where error characteristics are not expected to vary significantly between neighboring grid cells which is a reasonable assumption in this study area in this application of the stream section 3 2 the csgd error model is trained regionally over 25 0 1 grid cells at a time 5 grid cells wide and 5 grid cells high fig 3a to generate 0 5 scale regional error models this approach ensures that sufficient data is used during model training and that differences in imerg error characteristics are represented across the study region an additional precipitation dataset is generated by selecting the mean value of the conditional distribution generated for each imerg estimate in space and time adjusting the imerg estimate for systematic bias this precipitation dataset removes the systematic long term bias of imerg relative to stage iv and is referred to as bias corrected imerg in the remainder of this work 3 4 experimental set up the hlm is run for april october in 2008 2013 at a 1 hour timestep with the following five precipitation inputs 0 1 imerg 0 1 stage iv 1 24 stage iv 0 1 stream ensemble fields section 3 2 and a 0 1 bias corrected imerg field section 3 3 all precipitation inputs produce deterministic streamflow estimates except the stream ensemble fields which produce an ensemble of streamflow estimates two resolutions of stage iv precipitation are used so that the coarser 0 1 product bilinearly interpolated from the native 1 24 resolution product matches the resolution of imerg and any differences between the performance of the two stage iv products can be attributed to the resolution of the precipitation data the first month of the hlm simulation in each year april is discarded as a spin up period and may october is used for evaluation 3 5 streamflow peak event identification in order to assess hlm streamflow performance during high flow events we identify peak events using the wavelet based event identification method proposed in towler mccreight 2021 and liu et al 2011 this method assesses the statistical significance of the spectral power jumps that large streamflow events represent when the entire streamflow record is transformed into spectral space using a wavelet transform which creates a representation of the signal in both the time and frequency domain fig 4 a c we assessed the power spectrum averaged over the 1 8 day period to find statistically significant events at this scale wavelet based event identification is advantageous because it allows comparison of peak event characteristics peak flow flow volume event duration without the complication of timing errors intermittent periods with missing data in usgs gauge records are linearly interpolated for the purposes of event identification and calculation of total event volume after identifying events at each gauge site using observed usgs streamflow fig 4d the peak event flow and total event volume are calculated for the five largest events as determined by event volume using the observed streamflow and the simulated streamflow obtained by forcing hlm with all precipitation datasets at almost every gauge site the top five identified events included events during june 2008 and june 2013 the mean absolute error mae of imerg and stage iv simulations and mean continuous ranked probability score mcrps described in section 3 6 of stream simulations are calculated for peak flow and event volume at these events 3 6 performance metrics the normalized root mean squared error nrmse also referred to as the relative rmse falck et al 2015 is calculated for imerg based and stage iv based streamflow as well as for the mean of the stream based streamflow ensemble 4 nrmse 1 n t 1 n q t q t 2 1 n t 1 n q t where q t is the observed streamflow and q t is the predicted streamflow at timestep t the mean absolute error mae for deterministic streamflow estimates and the mean continuous ranked probability score mcrps for streamflow ensembles are calculated the continuous ranked probability score of an ensemble streamflow estimate is analogous to the absolute error of a single streamflow estimate and reduces to the absolute error as the ensemble size decreases to one therefore the mcrps of a probabilistic streamflow timeseries is analogous to the mae of a deterministic timeseries allowing for comparison of performance between probabilistic and deterministic streamflow predictions 5 mae 1 n t 1 n q t q t 6 mcrps 1 n t 1 n r f q t i q t q t 2 d q t where f q t is the forecasted distribution of streamflow in this case an ensemble rather than an explicit distribution and i is an indicator function the ideal value for nrmse mae and mcrps is 0 and higher values indicate worse performance the containing ratio cr is the proportion of observed streamflow data which lies within the range of the streamflow ensemble generated using stream precipitation ensembles this probabilistic performance metric and its counterpart the exceedance ratio er have been used by previous work in the satellite precipitation hydrologic modeling and forecast verification communities to assess ensemble performance e g franz hogue 2011 hartke et al 2022 maggioni et al 2013 xiong o connor 2008 7 cr 1 n t 1 n i q t where the indicator function i is equal to one when q t is bracketed by the minimum and maximum values of the predicted streamflow ensemble at timestep t and is equal to zero when q t lies outside the ensemble the ideal value for cr is 1 indicating that the ensemble brackets observed streamflow in every instance while the poorest performance would be indicated by a value of 0 the uncertainty ratio ur is the ratio between ensemble spread and the corresponding observed streamflow at each timestep and has been used in previous studies of probabilistic streamflow and soil moisture falck et al 2015 maggioni et al 2011 8 ur t 1 n q t max q t min t 1 n q t the ur can vary between 0 and infinity with lower values indicating lower ensemble spread relative to observed streamflow a high cr and low ur are ideal for ensemble predictions because this indicates that an ensemble is consistently bracketing observations while maintaining a small ensemble spread relative to observed streamflow values periods with missing data in usgs gauge records are excluded when calculating the above performance metrics 4 results fig 5 illustrates differences between the precipitation products used in this work by comparing the june 6 12 2008 cumulative precipitation preceding a major flood event imerg substantially overestimates total rainfall especially across southwestern iowa but correctly estimates over 150 mm of cumulative rainfall in northeastern iowa this is consistent with findings that imerg early tends to overestimate extreme precipitation in this part of the world li et al 2022 bias corrected imerg adjusts for imerg s systematic overestimation resulting in lower total rainfall in the southeast while estimating high totals in the northeast the mean of the stream ensemble looks generally similar to the bias corrected imerg field the visible 5 by 5 pixel blocks in the bias corrected and mean stream fields are artifacts of the regional csgd error model training scheme described in section 3 3 and represent the differences in 0 5 regional error models across the study area two randomly selected stream ensemble members in fig 5 demonstrate two of the scenarios that stream generates for possible true precipitation these fields correctly estimate high total rainfall in the northeast although with variation due to different representations of possible imerg random error and better match the spatial structure of the stage iv cumulative field than imerg does 4 1 performance of hlm streamflow estimates fig 6 shows the containing ratio cr of the streamflow ensemble generated using stream ensemble precipitation input and the percent reduction in mae of the imerg based streamflow when compared to the mcrps of the stream based streamflow ensemble the cr of the stream based streamflow ensemble varies across the study area but is consistently high in watersheds in eastern and western iowa lower cr values in the des moines lobe landform in central iowa correspond to an area where the hlm configuration has low performance mainly because the model does not account for changes in infiltration and flow due to agricultural tile drainage systems quintero et al 2020a b the mcrps of the stream based streamflow ensemble is lower than the mae of imerg based streamflow across all watersheds reducing the mae by up to 80 in some locations fig 7 plots the nrmse mae and mcrps of imerg stage iv and stream based streamflow estimates the cr and ur of the stream based ensemble are also presented in panels c and d stage iv based streamflow generally exhibits the lowest error however the stream based streamflow exhibits errors nearly as low as that of stage iv based streamflow and much lower than that of the imerg based simulations mae and mcrps increase with upstream area which is expected since streamflow magnitudes are greater in bigger basins the reduction in mcrps relative to mae by stream based streamflow estimates increases substantially with basin size the stream based streamflow ensemble exhibits a mcrps 50 lower than the mae of imerg based streamflow estimates at gauge sites with upstream areas greater than 10 000 km2 except for basins less than 100 km2 the cr of stream simulations generally increases with upstream area when basins less than 100 km2 the size of a single imerg pixel are excluded while the ur of the stream ensemble consistently decreases with upstream area the large ensemble spreads in small basins reflected by high ur may be due to the limitations of hydrological models in simulating fast hydrological responses in small basins when remote sensing products such as imerg are too coarse to capture nimmo et al 2021 széles et al 2020 fig 8 displays the mcrps and cr of stream based streamflow ensembles as a function of ensemble size and upstream area ensemble members were chosen at random to generate this plot mcrps generally decreases and cr generally increases with increasing ensemble size as shown previously in fig 5 mcrps increases with upstream area mcrps decreases with ensemble size in basins less than 4500 km2 in size until an ensemble size of 10 is reached after which the mcrps appears to stabilize in basins larger than 4500 km2 a larger ensemble appears to improve mcrps until an ensemble size of 20 is reached the cr demonstrates greater change with ensemble size for all basin sizes the cr continuously increases with ensemble size and basins less than 100 km2 greater than 2000 km2 in size eventually level out at a cr of approximately 0 6 0 55 the upstream area range that consistently has the lowest cr is 100 750 km2 4 2 performance of hlm streamflow estimates during extreme flow events fig 9 illustrates observed and simulated hlm streamflow during identified peak flow events at three gauges the cedar river at cedar rapids 16 814 km2 the iowa river at lone tree 11 114 km2 and east nishnabotna river at red oak 2 323 km2 visual comparison of observed and simulated streamflow reveals that stage iv based estimates generally match observations leading up to and during high flow events however even though stage iv precipitation data is relatively accurate stage iv based streamflow peaks often lag behind observed peaks indicating a timing error in the hydrologic model further stage iv based streamflow does not agree with observed streamflow during the recession period e g late june 2008 at the cedar river in fig 9 in almost all high flow events illustrated in fig 9 imerg based streamflow overestimates the actual streamflow sometimes by a considerable margin as could be expected from imerg s overestimation of precipitation as seen in fig 5 the stream simulation mean generally matches stage iv and observations more than imerg and the 90 confidence interval brackets the observed streamflow at almost all timesteps during increasing and peak flows the stream 90 ci is widest during periods when imerg uncertainty is high and imerg based streamflow estimates correspondingly exhibit high error e g the 2010 event in fig 9 all hlm simulations exhibit a tendency to underestimate streamflow during the recession period following peak events note that the plateau in usgs observed streamflow during the 2013 event at lone tree is likely due to reservoir operations approximately twenty miles upstream at coralville dam the mae of imerg and stage iv based streamflow and mcrps of stream based streamflow ensembles when estimating the peak flow event volume and event duration calculated for the largest ten events during the study period at each gauge are shown in fig 10 a c as with the mae and mcrps for estimating streamflow the mae and mcrps for estimated peak flow and event volume increase with upstream basin area the mcrps of stream based peak flow estimates is substantially reduced relative to the mae of imerg based peak flow at gauge locations with upstream areas greater than 1 000 km2 the accuracy of event volume predictions does not improve as much as the accuracy of peak flow when predicted using the stream ensemble instead of imerg the relative error in estimated peak flow event volume and event duration for identified events at 97 gauge stations in june 2008 and 101 gauge stations in june 2013 are shown in fig 10d f and fig 10g i respectively as found in quintero et al 2020b errors in peak flow estimation increase with upstream area fig 10d 10 g the relative error is calculated for the mean of stream simulations imerg consistently overestimates peak flow across all sites during the 2008 event while stage iv estimates are much closer to observed values while stage iv and stream consistently outperform imerg when the top 10 events are considered results are more varied when individual events during june 2008 and 2013 are examined while stream improves on peak flow estimates in the largest basins it shows slightly higher error than imerg and stage iv when estimating total event volume during these events note that no results for basins less than 100 km2 in area are shown for the individual june 2008 and 2013 events due to few basins of that size detecting an event during those periods 4 3 effect of precipitation uncertainty precipitation resolution and bias correction fig 11 presents the proportion of streamflow error here in terms of mae that can be attributed to different precipitation sources sorted by upstream area fig 11a shows the percent reduction in mae from imerg based streamflow to streamflow forced by more accurate stage iv data at 0 1 resolution and at native resolution the percentage of streamflow mae attributable to imerg uncertainty increases with upstream area and ranges from 20 to 40 of mae on average across basin sizes in some basins this percentage is as high as 60 fig 10b compares the percent reduction of imerg based streamflow mae when compared to bias corrected imerg yellow described in section 3 3 and the stream ensemble simulations magenta the reduction in streamflow mae is consistently higher across basin sizes when using the stream ensemble instead of bias corrected imerg to force the hlm in some basins using bias corrected imerg to predict streamflow actually increases the mae of predicted streamflow relative to imerg unlike the stream based streamflow estimates streamflow based on bias corrected imerg appears to perform worse relative to imerg as the upstream area increases at gauge sites although fig 11b is calculated using all streamflow estimates supplemental fig 2 shows the same analysis for the highest 10 of streamflow observations at each gauge site 5 discussion 5 1 performance of hlm streamflow estimates overall and during peak flow events across study results use of the stream ensemble to force the hlm hydrologic model improves streamflow performance to nearly the same degree as use of ground reference data relative to the satellite multisensor product imerg results that demonstrate greater relative improvement in mae in large basins when using stream ensemble fields to force the hlm fig 7 fig 11 correspond to results in falck et al 2018 which found greater reduction in random error at large basin scales in brazil while the error in streamflow estimates improves when precipitation uncertainty is accounted for across basin sizes figs 7 9 and 11 the notably greater reduction in mcrps relative to mae in large basins demonstrates the importance of accounting for precipitation uncertainty in hydrologic models for basins greater than 10 000 km2 in size figs 6 and 7 that stream based simulations exhibit nrmse and mcrps nearly as low as that of stage iv based simulations across all gauge sites figs 6 and 10 demonstrates that stream effectively captures the range of true precipitation and substantially reduces the effects of precipitation uncertainty on hlm output notably this is contingent on both the ability of stream to simulate the space time autocorrelation structure of errors as well as the ability of the csgd error model to provide apt uncertainty characterizations for every imerg estimate improved streamflow prediction using the stream ensemble supports previous work demonstrating the advantages of ensemble based probabilistic flood forecasting e g cloke pappenberger 2009 verbunt et al 2007 the stream ensemble outperforms bias corrected imerg because firstly the bias corrected product cannot simulate extreme rain rates while it is correcting for the systematic tendency of imerg to overestimate moderate to high precipitation events furthermore bias corrected imerg cannot simulate high rain rates over multiple pixels e g autocorrelated errors in a watershed which leads to heavy underestimation of streamflow in instances when high rain rates are in fact occurring across a watershed it is also interesting that imerg based streamflow does not always fall within the stream ensemble range especially during peak flows see fig 9 supplemental fig 1 this occurs when imerg overestimates precipitation over multiple pixels and the stream methodology generates precipitation fields that may contain some high rain rates or a similar area of precipitation but that depict lower precipitation overall across a region essentially during process of correcting for systematic bias simulating the range of random error and simulating error autocorrelation structures stream recognizes that such a large area of extreme rainfall observed by imerg is statistically very unlikely to correspond to such extreme true rainfall thus no ensemble members are generated that predict this high regional precipitation as the possible true rainfall the resulting streamflow forced by the stream ensemble does not always bracket the imerg based simulation e g july 2010 at cedar rapids in fig 9 but it is clear that stream is correct in generally reducing precipitation rates the stream ensemble replicates the stage iv simulation and observations more than imerg fig 9 supplemental fig 1 the decreasing ur and increasing cr of the stream based streamflow ensemble with upstream area may be due to smaller relative uncertainties uc in larger basins as in falck et al 2015 maggioni et al 2013 these ur and cr trends also demonstrate that the higher cr in larger basins is not due to a significantly larger ensemble spread relative to the average streamflow these results are consistent with previous findings by falck et al 2015 which also found ur to decrease with increasing upstream area in brazil additionally it could be expected that basins with upstream areas less than 100 km2 perform differently than larger basins e g fig 7c because the runoff in these basins is based on imerg estimates from a single pixel in watersheds smaller than the area of an imerg pixel the spatial autocorrelation of errors in multiple pixels does not impact the total watershed precipitation decreasing performance of bias corrected imerg predictions with upstream area fig 11b supplemental fig 2b indicates that basins in this study area are not effectively filtering out precipitation random error otherwise larger basin areas should correspond to better performance of streamflow predictions generated by imerg and bias corrected imerg that stream based predictions meanwhile improve in performance with upstream area fig 11b supplemental fig 2b indicates that 1 autocorrelation of random errors has a substantial impact on the propagation of precipitation error in the hlm and 2 stream effectively simulates such autocorrelation structures the containing ratio and mcrps show consistent improvement with increasing ensemble size until approximately an ensemble size of approximately 30 fig 8 in small basins fewer ensemble members are required which is intuitive given the limited variety of potential true precipitation fields that an ensemble generates for basins covered by only a handful of imerg pixels however in large basins where there are more possible combinations of precipitation error and error autocorrelation structures more realizations of possible true precipitation fields are required to capture observed streamflow the hillslope link model was designed principally to monitor high streamflow conditions that may endanger communities and infrastructure in iowa it is therefore not unexpected that its streamflow estimates during low flow conditions do not consistently match usgs observations see fig 8 quintero et al 2020a b the inaccuracy in hlm streamflow estimates during low flow conditions or recessions after peak events when the high quality stage iv product is used e g fig 8 provides reasonable grounds to conclude that poor streamflow accuracy at low flows is more due to structural or parameter error within hlm rather than problems with the precipitation visual inspection of hydrographs also reveals timing errors in predicted peak streamflow events june 2008 at east nishnabotna river in fig 9 such errors can be attributed to either the hlm or insufficient temporal resolution of precipitation forcing data but not to precipitation uncertainty since even the high accuracy ground reference precipitation dataset fails to generate correct timing of peak streamflow in some instances while these results have been produced and analyzed over the central u s using the hillslope link model we believe that other geographic regions would also demonstrate better performance when using ground reference data rather than smp estimates the extent to which stream precipitation ensembles improve on imerg based simulations of streamflow may vary with the climate terrain and rainfall runoff mechanisms which dominate other regions it could be expected that stream continues to improve streamflow predictions in large basins where autocorrelated errors in smp data impact streamflow estimates additionally although all available 2005 2007 stage iv data is used to train the csgd error model in the stream framework supplemental fig 3 demonstrates the impact of reduced ground reference training data on the csgd error model and resulting stream ensemble the 2005 2007 imerg and stage iv timeseries from five randomly selected pixels are used to train regional csgd error models for six 2 5 regions covering the study area the resulting 2 5 or 25 by 25 pixel regional error models present a coarser characterization of imerg error than the 0 5 regional error models trained in the original csgd error model scheme section 3 3 this data limited error characterization uses roughly 1 of the training data used in the original error models e g 5 pixels instead of 25 25 625 pixels for a 2 5 area the climatological mean precipitation based on this limited stage iv dataset although at a coarser 2 5 scale replicates the pattern obtained when training 0 5 regional models supplemental fig 3a and 3b most importantly a randomly selected ensemble member generated by stream using the original and the limited csgd error model but the same random noise field is nearly indistinguishable supplemental fig 3c and 3d the stream ensemble mean using both csgd error modeling approaches is also nearly identical supplemental fig 3e and 3f this shows that the csgd error model can be calibrated using quite minimal ground reference data and produce similarly performing stream ensembles as when trained with abundant ground reference data 5 2 effect of precipitation uncertainty precipitation resolution and bias correction a sizeable percentage between 20 and 40 on average across basin sizes of the error in predicted streamflow using imerg data can be attributed to errors in this precipitation data product fig 11a the minimal difference in mae reduction when using 1 24 and 0 1 resolution stage iv demonstrates that uncertainty in precipitation data makes a larger contribution towards the error in simulated streamflow than does this resolution difference of the precipitation data coarser resolution stage iv improves predicted streamflow accuracy slightly more that native resolution stage iv except in the largest basins fig 11a when only the top 10 of streamflow observations are considered however native resolution stage iv outperforms the coarser resolution product in all basin size categories except those less than 100 km2 supplemental fig 2 the ability of coarser ground reference data to estimate streamflow with a slightly lower mae than 1 24 resolution ground reference data is most likely due to sampling error several of the usgs gauge sites for basins in this study only have available data for two or three of the years in the six years study period correcting for systematic bias does not account for random error which is a substantial component of overall imerg and other smp product uncertainty fig 11b during all flows and particularly during the highest subset of streamflow across gauge sites streamflow error is consistently reduced more when the stream ensemble is used as input to the hlm rather than the bias corrected imerg dataset this demonstrates the inadequacy of bias correction as an approach to addressing precipitation uncertainty in hydrologic models like the hlm and supports similar findings in habib et al 2014 and hartke et al 2020 regarding smp uncertainty in runoff simulations and landslide hazard applications respectively 6 summary and conclusions although satellite multisensor precipitation products and numerical weather model fields have made possible near real time hydrologic modeling on a continental to global scale in recent decades streamflow estimates are hampered by the uncertainty in precipitation data from these sources overestimation underestimation and incorrect detection of precipitation all lead to less accurate estimates of runoff and streamflow in hydrologic models the magnitude of precipitation error propagation varies across watersheds but is particularly variable in semi arid regions and other settings where the rainfall runoff generation processes are highly nonlinear although hydrologic model calibration may reduce the propagation of forcing data uncertainty it is no substitute for explicitly representing the uncertainty in forcing precipitation data which includes substantial random error in addition to systematic bias however this effort is complicated by the need to simulate the autocorrelation structure of precipitation errors in order to capture basin scale precipitation uncertainty while minimizing reliance on ground references and representing precipitation uncertainty in a way that hydrologic models or other applications with deterministic inputs can readily ingest in this paper precipitation ensembles generated by the space time rainfall error and autocorrelation model stream are used to force the hillslope link model and simulate streamflow ensembles which reflect the uncertainty in precipitation forcing from imerg using stream ensembles substantially reduces the error in streamflow estimates overall and during peak flow events often approaching the performance of streamflow simulations forced by a ground reference precipitation product results show that a substantial portion of the error between predicted and observed streamflow as much as 60 when modeled using the hillslope link hydrologic model in the central u s is due to the error in imerg correcting for systematic bias while neglecting the range of random error is shown to be an insufficient approach to addressing precipitation uncertainty and can actually worsen streamflow predictions results also reemphasize the results of cunha et al 2012 that the spatial autocorrelation of precipitation errors heavily impacts the ability of basins to filter out precipitation uncertainty although stream is applied to smp data in this work and in hartke et al 2022 it is also applicable to numerical weather prediction nwp model fields additionally although the error characterization in this work utilizes a ground reference product for calibration recent work by li et al 2021 demonstrates a method for characterizing satellite precipitation uncertainty using dual precipitation radar data this will allow stream to generate precipitation ensembles to represent satellite precipitation uncertainty anywhere in the world without ground reference data future work will use a similar methodology as demonstrated in this work to account for satellite precipitation uncertainty in hydrologic modeling on a continental to global scale without reliance on any ground based precipitation data credit authorship

8539,apparent groundwater age dating has been proven useful and robust in understanding water origin and mixing processes particularly when multiple tracers are considered however even though now extensively used the age tracers have not been widely applied in the general practice of flow and transport model calibration a multi tracer study was carried out in the neogene aquifer in flanders to quantify the apparent age and construct a joint interpretation for the delineation of different groundwater flow systems this understanding is critical as part of the safety and feasibility studies for the underlying boom clay formation that has been considered as a potential host rock for the geological disposal of radioactive waste in this study we combine evidence from tritium helium 3 3h 3he helium 4 4he and radiocarbon 14c dating as well as stable isotopic δ18o δ2h and hydrochemical signatures in combination with particle tracking based age distributions from the 3d groundwater flow model the results of the study indicate that mixing of groundwater with young and old fractions occurs predominantly in the central part of the aquifer which is made evident by the coexistence of 3h pre and post bomb pulse era 14c and 4he in several groundwater samples the mixing between water of different origin is also supported by the sampled stable isotopic and hydrochemical composition of groundwater particle tracking residence time results show an acceptable agreement with apparent ages derived from age tracers for young 100 years and old 1000 years groundwater groundwater with ages between 100 and 1000 years is likely a mixture of water with young old fractions and shows the strongest discrepancies between advective model ages and age tracer based apparent ages on the basis of our findings we distinguish between three groundwater flow systems in the neogene aquifer i a shallow local flow system with groundwater originating from modern meteoric water ii a deep semi regional flow system characterized by old groundwater where the presence of 4herad is significant iii a mixed zone of groundwater flow where the recently infiltrated meteoric water mixes with discharging old groundwater these results have helped us to refine previously proposed conceptual models for the study area and will in the end reduce uncertainties relevant to the potential future geological disposal of radioactive waste keywords radioactive isotopes hydrochemistry age tracers groundwater age distribution groundwater residence time belgium data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction assessing the characteristics and spatial patterns of groundwater flow and its chemical and isotopic composition is fundamental for understanding hydrogeological systems the sustainability of these water reservoirs has recently gained a particular interest as a result of the increased stress on global water resources due to climate change and increased groundwater consumption jasechko et al 2017 petersen et al 2018 bierkens and wada 2019 cuthbert et al 2019 gleeson et al 2020 it is therefore critical to evaluate the potential repercussions on groundwater

important role in better understanding groundwater systems e g groundwater age distributions mixing processes water origin recharge conditions phillips and castro 2013 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 they can be used separately to evaluate a specific age range however if strong mixing of flow components with different origins and varying residence times is occurring the estimated apparent age would be biased corcho alvarado et al 2007 stolp et al 2010 gardner and heilweil 2014 this is more likely to take place in long screened wells where the intersection with several flow lines with different residence times flow paths and recharge areas is expected stolp et al 2010 suckow 2014 gil márquez et al 2020 additionally tracers may be influenced by physiochemical processes e g dilution degradation dispersion diffusion that might alter their concentrations resulting in uncertain apparent ages sanford 1997 solomon and cook 2000 cook 2020 numerous multi tracer studies have been performed to overcome these uncertainties lehmann et al 2003 stadler et al 2010 plummer et al 2012 gardner and heilweil 2014 for instance cendón et al 2020 used a combination of 14c 3h and stable isotopes measurements to characterize the groundwater residence times and aid water management strategies in maputo mozambique old groundwater age tracers 36cl 4he 14c have been used by müller et al 2016 and kulongoski et al 2008 in najd oman and in the amadeus basin in central australia respectively to test their applicability at different sections of the assumed flow paths and to determine the sources of groundwater additionally the conjoint use of 3h 4he 14c hydrochemical signatures and stable isotopes has also been applied to identify the mechanisms of recharge and respective climatic conditions by pärn et al 2019 in the baltic artesian basin in northern estonia and by walraevens et al 2020 for the ledo paniselian aquifer in belgium in addition age tracers can be potentially useful for parameterization of groundwater models turnadge and smerdon 2014 mccallum et al 2015 the integration of all available information on physical and chemical state variables and material properties into numerical models can aid us to advance our current knowledge and to further assess the responses of groundwater systems to different potential disturbances cohen shacham et al 2016 dentzer et al 2017 petersen et al 2018 bowen et al 2019 dillon et al 2019 however only a few studies have combined apparent groundwater ages or the raw tracer concentrations with 3d numerical models sanford 2011 müller et al 2016 as described in detail by schilling et al 2019 the use of age tracers and information of groundwater residence time can be beneficial for flow model calibration on the other hand advective ages from numerical models can be compared with tracer ages to test the validity of assumptions used in respective models and refine the conceptual understanding of the studied systems reilly et al 1994 suckow 2014 as a first step prior to integrating the physical and chemical state variable information into numerical models this work focuses on the evaluation of groundwater flow patterns in the neogene aquifer belgium by comparing the apparent ages derived from age tracers and advective ages derived from a numerical model the neogene aquifer in the lowland nete catchment in flanders has been subject of several studies due to its regional importance as the main groundwater reservoir coetsiers and walraevens 2006 2009 and due to the potential use of the underlying boom clay formation as a host formation for the installation of a radioactive waste repository van keer et al 1999 gedeon 2008 beerten et al 2010 ondraf niras 2010 2013 vandersteen et al 2013 rogiers et al 2015 previous studies have been performed in the neogene aquifer to describe its hydrochemical characteristics coetsiers and walraevens 2006 coetsiers 2007 to study groundwater residence times by using 14c model ages coetsiers and walraevens 2009 to quantify fluxes with the use of temperature measurements and dilution tests rogiers et al 2015 and to evaluate groundwater flow systems by numerical modelling gedeon 2008 casillas trasvina et al 2021 in this research the apparent age distribution in the neogene aquifer is studied by a multi tracer approach using 14c 3h 3he and the accumulation of 4herad with the support of δ18o and δ2h hydrochemistry and particle tracking it is the first multi tracer study performed in the region the main objectives of this contribution are to i characterize groundwater flow systems using apparent tracer ages in combination with hydrochemical and stable isotope evidence and ii complement the conceptual flow model of the region by comparing its advective transport particle tracking ages with apparent model ages and 4he accumulation further understanding of these aspects is of utmost importance in the framework of geological disposal of radioactive waste and for the future use of age tracer concentrations as additional state variables for numerical modelling inverse conditioning at the catchment scale 2 study area and hydrogeological settings the neogene aquifer is located in the campine area in the northeast of flanders fig 1 a and b and considered to be the most important groundwater reservoir in the region coetsiers and walraevens 2006 flanders is characterized by a temperate oceanic climate in general summers are relatively cool and rainy and winters are relatively mild and wet the mean temperature in the area varies from 3 c to 19 c from winter to summer respectively with a mean annual precipitation of 899 mm a full description of the study area has been presented elsewhere casillas trasvina et al 2021 for brevity only a summary is given here the area is characterized by low relief with altitudes ranging from 5 to 70 m above taw tweede algemene waterpassing the hydrography is characterized by an east west drainage system that belongs mainly to the scheldt river basin van keer et al 1999 rogiers et al 2014 see fig 2 the aquifer is composed of neogene marine sand deposits that exert some variations on the hydrochemical composition the groundwater however is in general weakly mineralized coetsiers and walraevens 2008 the oligocene rupelian and mio pliocene geology of the study area is presented in fig 1b the lithology consists of fine to medium grained sands with some clay content in certain units e g kasterlee lillo and diest formations while basal gravels are sometimes present between the units laga et al 2001 the sediments dip towards the north northeast with a gentle slope of about 1 2 in the eastern north eastern part of the study area faults occur as a consequence of the development of the roer valley graben rvg the northwestern part of the lower rhine graben coetsiers and walraevens 2008 verbeeck et al 2017 deckers et al 2018 the most important of these faults in terms of cenozoic offset is the rauw fault which is proven to have been active during the pleistocene verbeeck et al 2017 the effects of the rauw fault zone on the distribution of fluxes and hydraulic head fig 2 has been thoroughly discussed by casillas trasvina et al 2021 for a more detailed description please refer to verbeeck et al 2017 late quaternary deposits mostly fluvial and aeolian sands overlie the neogene units and constitute the upper few meters of the aquifer system the hydrostratigraphical units occurring below these are composed the of plio pleistocene sediments these consists of the malle merksplas mol and lillo sands overlying the miocene kasterlee formation a mixed clayey sandy unit deposited in shallow marine to estuarine conditions it is followed by the miocene diest sands overlaying the late oligocene and lower miocene voort and berchem sands these latter three formations contain significant amounts of glauconite and clay in the form of thin layers finally the boom clay an oligocene marine sediment forms the lower boundary of the system for a more detailed description of the hydrostratigraphy of the area and the boom clay please refer to laga et al 2001 coetsiers and walraevens 2008 yu et al 2013 and vandenberghe et al 2014 notwithstanding their lithological differences patyn et al 1989 concluded from hydrogeological observations that these sediments behave as a single aquifer similarly to casillas trasvina et al 2021 in this work groundwater in the quaternary pleistocene upper and lower pliocene deposits together with the oligocene and lower miocene sands is referred to as the neogene aquifer the hydraulic head distribution in the studied portion of the neogene aquifer is shown in fig 2 an overview of hydraulic conductivity values used in the nam model by casillas trasvina et al 2021 is presented in table 1 the overall groundwater hydrochemistry of the aquifer has been comprehensively described by coetsiers and walraevens 2006 and coetsiers 2007 in general the sediments at shallow depths 50 m below surface are well flushed and decalcified in most of the area this leads to shallow groundwater being characterized by relatively low ph values and weakly mineralization ec values of 250 us cm or lower coetsiers and walraevens 2006 in the western part of the aquifer amounts of calcite have been reported which can react with infiltrating water however it may play an important role only in the deeper parts of the aquifer near the berchem voort sands where the calculated saturation index si is estimated to vary from 7 to 0 with a mean value around 1 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 also in the deepest parts of the aquifer calcite dissolution plays an important role the oxidation of pyrite by o2 or no3 causes high so4 2 concentrations in shallow groundwater coetsiers and walraevens 2006 additionally reduced iron is released to the solution from oxides and hydroxides in these reducing conditions coetsiers and walraevens 2009 organic matter degradation plays a significant role in the general hydrochemistry of the aquifer coetsiers and walraevens 2009 a redox sequence is followed where o2 is reduced first then no3 after which mn oxide and fe hydr oxide reduction occurs followed by so4 2 reduction and finally methanogenesis given that ch4 production occurs at the same redox potential as so4 2 reduction it was deduced that it is taking place in the deepest parts of the neogene aquifer fig 1c coetsiers and walraevens 2006 also in the deep part of the aquifer an increase in na is observed as a result of cation exchange the latter decreases the ca2 concentration initiating a second stage of calcite dissolution and increasing the hco3 concentrations walraevens 1990 coetsiers and walraevens 2006 these processes have been evaluated by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 by considering the different 14c dilution reactions that are geochemically aging the groundwater from coetsiers and walraevens 2009 recent dissolved organic matter is concluded to play an important role in the redox reactions resulting in 14c model ages between 0 6 and 6 5 k years however these ages might not be representative for the whole aquifer as the deepest areas of the aquifer were not sampled 3 methodology 3 1 sampling procedures the groundwater samples investigated in this study were collected in march 2019 a total of 22 piezometers at 8 selected locations were sampled across the nete catchment within the neogene aquifer fig 2 these piezometers are being monitored by sck cen the groundwater samples were analysed for stable water isotopes 3h 3he 4he 14c and ions the sampling strategy was focused on getting a complete data set which includes hydrochemical composition major and minor ions trace elements and isotopic data at each sampling site earlier campaigns have been performed in the area by rogiers et al unpublished work 2016 van keer et al 1999 and coetsiers and walraevens 2006 2009 from which their collected data have been compiled in this work an overview of the collected samples per campaign is shown in table 2 two different submergible pumps were used during the whole 2019 campaign the geotech ss geosub pump https www geotechenv com geotech ss geosub html and the grundfos mp1 pump https www envieq com grundfos mp1 best solution both pumps have similar characteristics allowing one to control the flow down to rates as low as 100 ml min the parameters measured on site include ph electrical conductivity ec and redox potential eh with the use of portable probes and a flow through cell before any sampling the wellbores were purged at least 3 casing volumes and sampled until an apparent stabilization of field parameters was observed when possible 1 1 two wells namely r 54c and r 54e below the boom clay were not fully flushed pumping rates were low at these locations because of potential issues with the filter and or low hydraulic conductivity of the surrounding sediments thus samples were taken without complete purging particularly for r 54e only bursts of groundwater were possible to be abstracted and collected this was done to obtain representative samples of in situ groundwater with minimum disturbance of the flow system and the collected sample different sampling bottles were used depending on the hydrochemical analysis to be performed transparent polyethylene pe brown glass and green glass bottles bottles were acidified with 1 ml of h2so4 for cation analyses in accordance with standard methods for preservation of groundwater samples for a detailed list of the parameters to be measured from each bottle see the electronic supplementary material esm 1 the procedure for noble gas sampling of groundwater using copper tubes described by vandersteen et al 2017 was followed collecting samples in duplicates this procedure is based on the provided guidelines by helis sültenfuβ et al 2009 the laboratory for helium isotopes studies of the university of bremen https www noblegas uni bremen de these copper tubes were closed vacuum tight by stainless steel clamps at both ends for 3h δ13c and 14c two air tight 1 liter pe bottles were filled with

the submission to the respective laboratories for analyses 3 2 analytical methods different methods were applied the majority of the major hydrochemical components were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms the concentrations of fe2 fe 3 nh4 no3 no2 cl and po4 2 were measured by molecular spectrometry the quality of the analytical results of the measured ions was evaluated by determining their ionic balance errors threshold 5 additionally the water types of all groundwater samples have been classified following stuyfzand 1986 stable isotopes δ18o 2h and δ13c

filters were used to analyse for the δ13c and for 14c activity correction of the initial 14c activity was applied following the model procedure outlined by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 built for the same aquifer the 14c correction model by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 quantifies the contribution of c in groundwater recharge calcite dissolution oxidation of organic matter and methane ch4 formation to the inorganic c pool and its influence on the 14c activity an estimate of c originating from these processes is made with the use of ca2 fe2 so4 2 and hco3 concentrations the δ13c values

advective transport model a modflow 2005 harbaugh et al 2005 steady state groundwater flow model has been developed for the nete catchment by casillas trasvina et al 2021 a short summary of the model set up is presented here the model was discretized in 49 vertical layers the thickness of the first three layers was set to 50 80 and 100 of the ground surface elevation above sea level taw hence the bottom of the third layer is a flat plane at 0 m asl from layer 4 to 9 each layer is 5 m thick while layers from 10 to 49 have a thickness of 10 m the modelled area was discretized into a regular model grid of 96 rows and 146 columns resulting in cells with dimensions of 400 m 400 m the latest hydrostratigraphic 3d model of flanders by deckers et al 2019 is used resulting in 9 hydrogeological units using the modflow s hydrogeologic unit flow package non tabular quaternary quaternary above campine aquifer system and the weelde malle merksplas mol lillo kasterlee diest and berchem voort formations additionally the faults included in the h3d model were also implemented a total of 23 faults were simulated with the horizontal flow barrier hfb package harbaugh et al 2005 starting from the top of the second numerical layer 12 18 m below ground surface to the bottom of the modelled domain given that the faults do not present a clear surface expression verbeeck et al 2017 distributed recharge values derived from vegetation cover soil texture and depth to the groundwater table were obtained from diciacca 2020 and included as a specified flux condition internal specified sinks sources were abstraction wells from the flemish environment agency vlaamse milieumaatschappij vmm and rivers and ditches obtained from the flemish hydrographic atlas vlaamse hydrografische atlas vmm 2017 and the ign ngi dataset ign ngi 2017 are implemented through the wel river and drain packages respectively the horizontal hydraulic conductivities of each hydrogeological unit a recharge scaling factor the hydraulic properties of the faults as well as river and drain conductance were calibrated using the global standard particle swarm optimization spso11 scheme clerc et al 2012 zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2013 a total of 1393 averaged hydraulic head observation values were used as observations targets during the calibration procedure the resulting head distribution is shown in fig 2 the steady state modflow flow field solution forms the basis for the advective transport simulation performed using modpath pollock 2016 backward particle tracking from the well screen to its recharge location is simulated with modpath and allows us to determine the residence time of each particle the travel time of each released particle in a cell is determined by modpath based on the modflow cell by cell flow rate the cell by cell flow rate is controlled by the prescribed recharge and the hydraulic conductivity of every hydrogeological formation following konikow et al 2008 in order to ensure stability particles were evenly distributed 10 10 10 in the model cell where the well screen is located the simulated distribution of particle residence times at each well was then compared to the corresponding tracer derived apparent ages e g 3h 3he 14c 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical composition the initial characterization of the hydrochemistry of the neogene aquifer was presented by coetsiers and walraevens 2006 here we will present the results from the current work in relation to the previous results the well id screen depth sampling date the stuyfzand 1986 water type classification and isotope values for the sampled wells during the current campaign are shown in table 3 for the complete set of analysed results see esm 2 for most of the samples the error on the ionic balance was smaller than 5 however in some cases denoted with in table 3 the error was higher up to 11 for these cases the σc σa 5 meq l sum of anions sum of cations indicated that these are weakly mineralized waters thus this error may be acceptable walraevens 2000 for 2 cases denoted with in table 2 the σc σa 5 meq l and the error amounts to 10 the stuyfzand 1986 classification was applied to the chemical data included in table 3 all the groundwater samples in the neogene aquifer have cl 150 mg l indicating fresh fresh oligohaline waters codes f and g respectively and very soft to hard to 2 on the other hand the groundwater sample taken from below the boom clay presents a value of 1790 mg cl l and is classified as a brackish salt water type code b the obtained results are in accordance with the published results of coetsiers and walraevens 2006 for regional characterization of the neogene aquifer groundwater sampled in shallow wells is found to be camix naso4 cahco3 or caso4 water type according to coetsiers and walraevens 2006 pyrite oxidation in the unsaturated zone is responsible for the occurrence of these water types since calcite is not present there calcite dissolution only plays an important role in the deeper parts of the aquifer and towards the north also silicate weathering increases sio2 and cation concentrations along the groundwater flow direction high so4 2 concentrations are found in the shallow groundwater wells are caused by the oxidation of pyrite by means of o2 or no3 coetsiers and walraevens 2006 the oxidation of organic matter increases the hco3 content leading to the occurrence of the types cahco3 and camix additionally cation exchange was observed in the deepest wells manifested by the increase in na and mg2 concentrations in groundwater together with a a decrease in ca2 concentration the lowering of ca2 in groundwater causes a second stage of calcite dissolution which results in higher hco3 levels walraevens 1990 the groundwater type changes to cahco3 still very soft and then nahco3 here indicating the influence of cation exchange of the freshening type coetsiers et al 2004 this evolution is presented in a piper diagram in fig 3 on the left side of the piper diagram the evolution from cahco3 to nahco3 type fig 4 is indicated by the samples plotting near the na k axis due to the influence of cation exchange of the freshening type however samples plotting on the upper right side of the piper diagram suggest either salinization not in this case or some other processes e g pyrite oxidation with an increase in so4 2 which is the case for the neogene aquifer the pink arrow reflects the subsequent water types encountered along a flow line for piezometer r 54e with filter below the boom clay the water type reflects the presence of connate waters of nacl type originating from seawater infiltrating groundwater in various shallow piezometers within the first 50 m presents slightly higher cl values around 50 85 mg l this might be attributed either to infiltrating waters evapotranspiration processes occurring near the surface and or to land use e g fertilizer sewage water road de icing leading to the nacl type at the same time the lower cl concentrations could belong to groundwater from pre industrial era further down the groundwater flowline similarly to walraevens 1990 the groundwater quality evolution as a result from freshening is shown in fig 4 in this figure cl concentration increases with the verticalflow direction where nacl water types are found below the boom clay from deeper to shallower dilution of deep connate water takes place in the upper part of the fresh saltwater interface na concentration increases in a mixing zone leading to nahco3 water types due to cation exchange being derived from the desorption of marine cations in the na ca2 exchange lastly the evolution from mghco3 to cahco3 water type is found in the freshened recharge area where cation exchange is not playing a determining role any more walraevens 1990 2000 coetsiers and walraevens 2006 2008 coetsiers 2007 the spatial evolution of some groundwater quality components and further description of the groundwater chemistry is presented in the esm 3 4 2 stable isotopes composition stable isotope analyses δ2h and δ18o and radioisotope measurements have been carried out in order to obtain information on the origin of the waters and its recharge conditions results of the analyses are presented in table 3 available monthly data from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip were retrieved from the international atomic energy agency iaea https www iaea org services networks gnip from 1980 to 1990 the data were collected from three stations beek liege and gilzen rijen located in the surroundings of tilburg and breda being the closest stations to the study area the gnip data were used to construct the local meteoric water line lmwl providing the average relationship between hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic compositions in precipitation the lmwl is described by the equation δ d 6 918 δ 18 o 1 97 r 2 0 95 the global meteoric water line gmwl is described as δ d 8 δ 18 o 10 as given by craig 1961 regarding the stable isotope contents the values varied between 53 3 and 40 5 for δ2h and between 7 83 and 6 1 for δ18o a scatter plot of δ18o and δ2h of the groundwater samples in shown in fig 5 the clustering of a large number of groundwater samples around the lmwl indicates that local modern meteoric water is a significant source of groundwater recharge coplen et al 2011 porowski 2014 however some of the samples fall slightly below both the gmwl and the lmwl showing lighter δ2h isotopes still within the range measured from precipitation waters in gnip stations this might be attributed to the proximity of the evaporation source i e the north sea oiro et al 2018 and or to evapotranspiration differentiating the isotopic composition of groundwater and that isotopic enrichment of overlying soil water is transferred to groundwater and streams as a distinct isotopic signal as pointed out by kalvāns et al 2020 the groundwater regression line derived from the collected samples following δ d 6 158 δ 18 o 2 72 r 2 0 76 presents a lower slope than the gmwl and a negative intercept intercept 2 72 slope 6 158 suggesting the potential effect of evaporative enrichment on groundwater wassenaar et al 2011 joshi et al 2018 or the presence of a fraction of evaporated seawater piezometers presenting more negative values than those of surface waters i e from the same well with shallower filters e g r 34c r 2c r 16b might be indicative of wells recharged with a mixture including older ground waters i e older than waters derived from modern precipitation during potentially colder climatic conditions clark and fritz 1997 wassenaar et al 2011 4 3 groundwater age tracers 4 3 1 carbon 13 δ 13 and radiocarbon 14c the results for δ13c and 14c activity are presented in table 3 for the 22 groundwater samples the values of δ13c vary between 22 to 8 8 following similar ranges and patterns as those presented by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 however r 54e below the boom clay presents a δ13c value of 1 serving as an indication of isotopic enrichment potentially caused by methanogenesis the lowest values can be found at around 150 to 200 m depth mostly in the diest sands while δ13c values tend to generally increase with depth the initial δ13c values are largely determined by the degree of fractionation during photosynthetic plant uptake ehleringer and vogel 1993 vogel 1993 for belgium with a moderate climate vegetation follows the c3 photosynthetic cycle with δ13c values of around 25 as a result of co2 degassing following the decomposition of organic matter cerling et al 1991 the fractionation occurs with the hydrolysis of dissolved co2 to hco3 leading to an increase of δ13c values in groundwater with ph around 7 leybourne et al 2006 the results of the analysed samples taken from the neogene aquifer probably follow similar processes initially but organic matter oxidation in the saturated zone plays a role as well as very low δ13c values are encountered down to 22 a summarized description of the processes influencing the total c composition is presented next including the results from the current work and the work from coetsiers and walraevens 2006 for a more detailed description of these processes the reader is referred to coetsiers and walraevens 2009 a set of plots comparing δ13c 14c and the advective transport particle tracking ages are presented in fig 6 the comparison of the δ13c and 14c values following the approximate flow direction shown in fig 2 suggest an evolution of both parameters fig 6 a and b this can more clearly be seen by plotting the resulting values from this research together with the results from analyses from previous works and projects carried out in the area values of δ13c slightly increase from the recharge younger groundwater to the discharge area from 25 to around 12 this is mainly related to the redox processes linked to the total c composition the δ13c value higher than 5 indicates the sample taken from below the boom clay where the total c is more largely influenced by sulphate reduction and potentially methane production the 14c values decrease with as age increases along the flow direction with the groundwater parcel a few larger values of δ13c around 10 occur where the advective age is low this might also indicate the presence of i local recharge areas and ii the influence of the local river network on the local groundwater flow coetsiers and walraevens 2009 the relation of δ13c and 14c is shown in fig 6c although it can be roughly seen that most 14c values decrease with the increase of δ13c values with some anomalies this suggests that the radioactive decay is being overwritten by hydrochemical reaction involving carbon increasing the complexity of the system appelo and postma 2005 this shows the absolute necessity of taking these hydrochemical reactions into account when interpreting 14c ages the relation of δ13c with several other groundwater components is presented in esm 4 the results obtained from the laboratory analysis performed on the samples in the current campaign closely follow the results presented by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 and support and validate the representativeness of the findings of the analysed findings for these reasons the results from the hydrochemical analysis and data processing were further used to correct the initial 14c activities 4 3 2 corrected radiocarbon 14c activities and related apparent ages the major reactions occurring in the neogene aquifer are presented in the previous section for the samples taken during the current work and seem to be in good agreement with the results of coetsiers and walraevens 2009 however the exact contribution to the total c from these reactions need to be quantified and therefore a correction model is applied to the 14c initial activities the concentrations of these components and their contributions to the total c originating from calcite dissolution oxidation of organic matter and ch4 production is presented in the esm 4 additionally a detailed description on the application of the correction model for 14c initial activity is included in the esm 4 as well here a brief summary is provided the 14c measured values range from 1 6 to 160 pmc table 3 several piezometers i e r 11a r 51a r 6a r 6b present values above 100 pmc these wells have filters deeper than 50 m the high values in these wells would indicate young groundwater being recharged during the post bomb pulse era 1955 due to the 14c produced during atmospheric nuclear tests gallagher et al 2000 atkinson et al 2014 cartwright et al 2017 with a significantly shorter half life i e 12 32 yr tritium 3h can be used more effectively to date these younger groundwaters jasechko 2016 lindsey et al 2019 van keer et al 1999 previously compared models for correction of 14c activities i e vogel tamers pearson mook f g iaea evans eichinger in the same region concluding that these models produced relatively similar results 1 ky emphasis was put on the pearson 1965 model within the framework of the phymol project however these models are not as robust as required for the neogene aquifer since they only consider a few reactions for the sake of quality control we first reproduced the results obtained by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 to validate our workflow and then applied the method to on the 14c activities obtained during this study see section 3 3 1 the results of these calculations are presented in table 4 and described in more detail in esm 4 the relation between measured and calculated δ13c values show a good agreement demonstrating that the assumed contributions to the total c pool from these reactions describe the real situation sufficiently as shown in esm 4 the c fractions of the c sources are given in percentages together with 14c measured activity in table 4 the initial amount of 14c before the occurrence of radioactive decay is then determined by verifying which c fractions contain 14c initially by international convention it is accepted that c originating from the soil pre nuclear detonation contains 100 pmc 14c cook 2020 iaea 2003 iaea 1970 mook 2000 2014 c originating from calcite dissolution is usually fossil 0 pmc negative model ages were obtained if crecharge was left as the only c source considering that the organic matter being oxidized is originated from the matrix and is fossil a14c 0 pmc this indicates that recent dissolved organic matter with initial 14c 100 pmc in recharge water plays an important role in the redox processes occurring in the aquifer coetsiers and walraevens 2009 when taking this into account the majority of the samples present 14c ages corrected and uncorrected in the range of 1kyr to 10kyr with some negative values the rather younger model ages belong to shallow wells close to the surface the obtained apparent ages fall inside the holocene period indicating the relatively young age and rapid groundwater circulation in the shallow parts of the system this especially applies to water in the diest sands and overlaying formations however the corrected 14c model ages for samples r 2c r 34c and r 54c resulted in larger age estimates from 15 to 33kyr these wells are located in the deepest parts of the aquifer in the late oligocene and lower miocene formations of berchem voort sands i e r 2c and r 34c and eigenbilzen i e r 54c these formations are characterized by relatively low hydraulic conductivities of around 0 5 m d within an area in the surroundings of the rauw fault zone where groundwater flow is nearly stagnant casillas trasvina et al 2021 following this rationale 14c model ages indicate that groundwater residence times increase with depth and are longest near the bottom of the neogene aquifer influenced by the very low groundwater fluxes according to coetsiers and walraevens 2009 the corrected 14c ages obtained with the applied correction model will be an overestimation of the real age if part of the oxidized organic matter originated from the fossil matrix instead of being dissolved in the groundwater depending on the contribution of the fossil organic matter the real groundwater ages will vary between zero and the model age given that the results following the coetsiers and walraevens 2009 model are already an overestimation of the real groundwater ages the results from the pearson 1965 model fall in an even more conservative i e older side the pearson 1965 model largely overestimates the age when the measured 14c activity is low in relation to the coetsiers and walraevens 2009 model producing older corrected apparent ages for high 14c activities younger groundwater the modelled ages get relatively close to the model ages of coetsiers and walraevens 2009 model while still giving relatively older model ages gallagher et al 2000 discuss the usage of the mass balance approach and conclude that it is desirable to take into account all important reactions involving dissolved inorganic carbon in the mass transfer calculations extensive chemistry data are however needed for such an approach since insufficient data was acquired during the phymol project van keer et al 1999 to apply the correction model by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 the uncertainty of their calculated 14c model ages is probably substantial thus these model ages calculated for those samples should therefore be used with caution and only as an indication of the magnitude of the potentially upper limit of the groundwater 14c model age 4 3 3 tritium the 3h measured activity is presented in table 4 all samples contain 3h ranging from 0 01 to 12 4 tu with two comparatively large values in samples r 6a and r 6b of 177 4 and 66 7 tu respectively for these 2 samples to this date we don t have an explanation for these large tu observations samples with higher 3h activities than 1 5 i e r 11a r 16a r 34a r 51a r 6a r 6b have filters at shallow depths up to a maximum of 48 m below ground surface bgs the 3h 3he apparent ages for these wells are in the range of very recently recharged waters to waters recharged in the last few tens of years basically having a modern origin thus they characterize the youngest groundwater component measured in the aquifer the high 3h activities at these locations are consistent with their high measured 14c activities close to 100 pmc due to which their 14c corrected model ages resulted in negative values however tracers indicate short residence time also for wells r 16c and r 6d at depths of 176 and 328 m bgs respectively with negative 14c model ages but with positive uncorrected ages a relatively high measured 14c activity and rather high 3h activities both of these wells are located in the berchem voort sands at different ends north south ern of the rauw fault zone at the boundary of the roer valley graben see fig 2 the effect of the rauw fault zone on the distribution of flow has been described by casillas trasvina et al 2021 suggesting that groundwater with a variation of apparent ages might coexists in certain areas where groundwater flowlines converge in locations near the fault zones this could explain the young tracer based apparent ages in these deeper wells for samples l 64a r 16b r 2b r 34b r 54a r 54c and r 6c the measured 3h activity was below 0 1 this indicates that these waters have a rather large proportion of tritium free and or low tritium groundwater infiltrated before 1955 resulting in 3h 3he apparent ages of 66 years i e in the range from 70 to 150 years gil márquez et al 2020 a scatter plot of the apparent ages derived by the 3h 3he method versus the corrected 14c model ages is shown in fig 7 here the samples containing a mixture of tritium and tritium free groundwater above the year 1955 ce line in the 3h 3he axis and higher than 0 in the 14c apparent ages axis have a fehco3 cahco3 or nahco3 water subtype the water in the diest sands and berchem voort sands is characterized by groundwater with these water subtypes as shown in fig 1 and as presented by coetsiers and walraevens 2006 this serves as an indication of the zones where water mixing with a stronger dominance of older components takes place in the neogene aquifer by the presence of young and old age tracers in the same collected water sample on the other hand samples in overlaying formations characterized by caso4 camix and naso4 water subtypes with shallower filters have more tritium rich waters with negative 14c model ages 4 3 4 helium 4 the plausibility of the calculated 3h 3he and 14c model ages can be evaluated by analysing them in relation to the accumulation of 4herad in groundwater this relation is shown in fig 8 the 4herad values generally agree with findings derived from corrected 14c and 3h 3he model ages groundwaters with a nahco3 type seem to have a larger accumulation of 4herad 10 5 to 10 3 ccstp kg indicating a longer residence time which agrees with old 14c model ages samples with this water type are found near the bottom of the neogene aquifer in the berchem voort sands or in the deepest parts of the diest sands where the groundwater velocities are considerably lower compared to the rest of the aquifer casillas trasvina et al 2021 in the cahco3 camix caso4 water types the 4herad is significantly lower from 10 6 to 10 5 ccstp kg which agrees with their 14c model ages younger than 10 kyr the 4herad concentration was below detection limit in several samples mainly those near the surface with shallow filters located in quaternary and pliocene formations or on the shallow parts of the diest sands this may be due to the flux velocity at these depths where 4he concentrations get diluted jean baptiste et al 2009 however for samples l 64a r 16c r 2b r 34b r 51a and r 54c the accumulation of 4herad was detected together with the presence of 3h and 14c samples r 16c and r 51a both have large activities of 14c 91 and 100 pmc respectively and 3h 6 3 and 4 9 tu respectively very likely due to a significant component of modern recharge water given the depth at which r 16c is located 137 m in the berchem voort sands the occurrence of 4herad 1 9 10 06 ccstp kg is expected given its closeness to a potentially significant 4herad mass flux source from deeper clay bearing formations at the bottom of the aquifer the boom clay with uranium concentrations from 3 to 4 2 ppm and thorium from 8 to 12 7 ppm from jacops et al 2020 and potentially the mantle however for r 51a with a filter screen at 11 m bgs an accumulation of 7 2 10 06 ccstp kg of 4herad was also detected this well is in the diest sands at the westernmost side of the study area here the neogene aquifer thins to a thickness of 60 m leaving the filter of the well to just a couple tens of meters away from the boom clay samples l 64a r 2b r 34b and r 54c have all 14c values below 55 pmc and 3h below 0 1 tu indicating that a large portion of these waters derived from tritium free groundwater of the pre bomb pulse era with possibly a low fraction of post bomb era recharged groundwater mayer et al 2014 as explained in the previous section additionally casillas trasvina et al submitted 2022 discuss this pattern as shown in heat transport simulations derived by the proximity and density of the river network resulting in local flow systems where several flow lines converge the presence of 4herad here restates the mixing of young and old groundwater occurring in this part of the neogene aquifer the accumulation of 4herad increases with distance along the approximate flow direction see fig 2 groundwater at r 54c in the easternmost location the deepest filter within the neogene aquifer flows in a sub regional deep flow system towards the direction of l 64b potentially receiving inputs from more recently infiltrated groundwater this also agrees with the old 14c model age for this well fig 8 in the western southwestern part the neogene aquifer becomes thinner and the local shallow flow systems start to play a more influential role a mixing zone is generated here with inputs from modern and old groundwater where all three age tracers used in this work 14c 4he 3h are present in the groundwater as shown in wells l 64a and further downstream r 34b and r 2b these filters i e l 64a r 34b and r 2b are all located in the diest sands near the centre of the neogene aquifer with values in the same order of magnitude for the three tracers 3h and 4herad concentrations and 14c model ages at the same locations the deeper filters of the same wells namely l 64b r 34c and r 2c are all located in the berchem voort sands similarly the values for 4herad concentration and 14c model ages are both indicative of long residence times at these locations the 3h concentrations are very low 0 1 tu with non detected 3hetrit fraction meaning these waters have a negligible portion of groundwater with modern origin 1955 the relation between the 3he 4he and the ne he ratios fig 9 can confirm this reasoning allowing the distinction between young and old groundwater mayer et al 2014 samples plotting near the crustal end member 3h 3he ratio of 2 10 8 and ne he ratio of 0 namely l 64b r 34c and r 2c indicate that the production of 4he for these is virtually only of radiogenic origin pärn et al 2019 these samples are characterized by longer residence times and long water rock interaction as described by their 14c model ages see table 4 in these locations he has largely accumulated evolving from equilibrium values to low 3he 4he ratios 2 10 7 where ne he tends towards 0 ballentine and burnard 2002 gil márquez et al 2020 the production of tritiogenic 3he 3hetrit is derived from the decay of 3h in modern water starting from the atmospheric equilibrium concentrations shifting towards higher 3he 4he ratios 1 3 10 6 to 9 10 6 fig 9 the mixture of groundwater with a 4herad and 3hetrit fraction is displayed by a component following the 4herad production with a vertical offset from this line mayer et al 2014 allowing the distinction between young and old ground water for all samples with a ne he ratio above 3 3hetrit values are detected despite some having 3h values lower than 0 1 tu this indicates that they have a portion of modern water with a fraction that is consistent with decay from natural tritium of 2 4 tu cook and herczeg 2000 solomon and cook 2000 mayer et al 2014 samples that are the closest to air saturated water in equilibrium with the atmosphere are characteristic to recently infiltrated groundwater fig 9b 4 3 5 advective age distribution as aforementioned groundwater from different origin has been subjected to mixing in the neogene aquifer resulting in a broad range of estimated apparent ages with the use of a groundwater flow model developed in the context of this research by casillas trasvina et al 2021 an estimation of the distribution of advective ages at each sampled well was performed using modpath 7 pollock 2016 to check whether the estimated model ages from age tracers are consistent with the modelled groundwater flow velocities in fig 10 a and b the distribution of these advective ages is shown for a a cross section with the advective transport particle tracking age at the center of the model cell and b for each observation well location together with the apparent ages derived from 3h 3he the 14c model ages pearson 1965 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 and uncorrected i e conventional 14c model ages fig 10a shows a general picture of the advective age distribution in the aquifer where recharge areas can be idenfied characterized by ages 100 yr at a maximum of 50 m below surface these variations are more apparent being in the mol formation and the areas where the diest formation is nearest to the surface in the western part of the aquifer the areas where the kasterlee formation is near to the surface are characterized by older groundwater ages of around 100 1 000 yr as the kasterlee formation has relatively low hydraulic conductivity 0 6 m d in relation to the sediments above and below 11 5 m d for mol formation and 8 for diest formation respectively hampering the groundwater fluxes the majority of the diest formation is characterized by groundwater ages in the range of 100 1 000 yr with younger groundwaters towards the surface however to the east of the aquifer western of the rauw fault older groundwater ages 1 000 10 000 yr can be depicted these ages are derived from discharging old groundwater from the berchem voort formation at the bottom of the aquifer which is characterized by low hydraulic conductivities 0 5 m d and old groundwater 1 000 and 10 000 yr is some areas although these advective age values are obtained at the center of the groundwater flow model cell they already provide a good approximation of the general age distribution and the distributuon of groundwater flow systems in the aquifer however as discussed by suckow 2014 the distribution of groundwater ages is highly variable as groundwater flow paths from multiple directions may converge in the observation well filter from fig 10b the results of placing particled along the observation well filters are shown depicting a a broad range of ages ranging from recently recharged water residence time of 1 yr up to around 50 kyr groundwater with groundwater flow model advective ages of 100 yr or younger i e r 6a to r 51a show a good agreement with the estimated 3h 3he model apparent with the exception of r 51a 4herad in those samples was not detected in sample r 51a 4herad was detected but its presence is not unexpected given the closeness of the boom clay to this filter additionally all these samples have 14c values 90 pmc consistent with the young advective ages non detected 4herad concentration and 3h 3he derived apparent ages all pointing towards recently recharged groundwater groundwater with ages in the order of hundreds of years up to 1 kyr are characterized mainly by a cahco3 water type i e wells r 6c up to r 34b fig 10 this water type is characteristic to groundwater in the diest sands where the major influence of mixing between yound and old groundwater was identified in the previous sections additionally from this group of samples 4herad was only detected in wells r 2b l 64a and r 34b other samples of this group are also located in the same areas but are from relatively shallower filters and or near the rauw fault zone where modern groundwater fluxes are stronger and more influential casillas trasvina et al 2021 on the other hand the measured 14c activities for all the sampled wells in this group range between 24 up to 67 pmc with coetsiers and walraevens 2009 model ages around 1 1 to 8 2 kyr the advective age distribution at each filter is relatively narrow and unimodal as a consequence of not accounting for mixing by dispersion here dispersion might spread these distributions over a broader range of ages potentially accounting for the older groundwater component with origin from the deeper parts of the aquifer nevertheless coetsiers and walraevens 2009 mention that apparent ages derived by application of their model would likely result in overestimations of the real age due to considering all c form organic matter to be recent indicating a potential upper apparent age limit for the sampled waters coetsiers and walraevens 2009 the advective ages from the groundwater flow model suggest a compromise between young and old groundwater components that the currently used age tracers are unable to resolve given their own limitations e g half life apparent age limits uncertainties in estimations of initial activities here the application of a different age tracer such as ar 39 with a more suitable half life could be desirable clark 2015 finally advective age distributions for samples with model ages above1 kyr are mainly characterized by nahco3 water types distinctive for groundwater in the berchem voort sands and from the deepest parts of the diest sands these distributions tend to show a much broader advective age range with a multi modal shape this spread indicates that particles reaching these filters originate from different locations following different ranges of long and short er flowpaths as has been thoroughly discussed by suckow 2014 and mccallum et al 2014 for the majority of these samples from r 34a to r 16c fig 11 with the exceptions of r 34a and r 6d all contain 4herad concentrations however 4herad values coexist with detectable 3h 3he ages for instance sample r 54c has a filter with a length of 20 m in which a potentially large number of particle flow paths would essentially converge allowing a large number of apparent ages to be estimated suckow 2014 having wells with long filters would therefore increase the uncertainty in the apparent age estimates and thefore explain the concurrence of age tracers of longer half lives together with fraction of younger water characterized by small 3h concentrations in general the estimated 14c apparent ages corrected and or uncorrected for the older groundwaters in the neogene aquifer are within the same order of magnitude as those estimated by advective particle tracking showing an acceptable approximation to the modelled values this confirms that the reactions and processes influencing the total c in the aquifer considered in the correction model by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 are adequate 4 3 6 conceptual model of groundwater ages in the neogene aquifer based on the joint interpretation of model ages and regional advective flow pattern groundwater in the neogene aquifer presents a broad range of estimated apparent ages indicative of a strong mixing of waters with different origin this is supported by several lines of evidence as discussed above fig 11 shows an interpretation of the flow paths carrying groundwater with different ages young and old and their mixture along the hypothesized local intermediate and regional groundwater flow systems to the east of the rauw fault zone fig 11 groundwater flows from east to west across the kasterlee clay formation penetrating to the deepest part of the aquifer this is corraborated by the detection of 3h in sample r 54c where given its depth the presence of tritium and a 3hetrit component would not be expected on this flow path groundwater flow seems to divert into two possible directions i it continues flowing downstream and within the berchem voort sands at a low velocity given its hydraulic conductivity i e 0 5 m d casillas trasvina et al 2021 or ii is disturbed by the rauw fault around the center of the diest formation and diverts vertically upwards implying that vertical fluxes occur along the fault the conduit barrier function of the rauw fault zone and the effects it has on flow paths in its vicinity are thoroughly explored by casillas trasvina et al 2021 and support the observations made in the current work the δ18o and δ2h signatures further support these inferences indicating fig 5 that the majority of groundwater samples have a component of modern meteoric water while modern meteoric water is an important source of groundwater recharge the variation on isotopic composition is indicative of further processes occurring on the water mixture with more depleted isotopic composition also occurring i e wells r 2c r 34c r 54c and l 64b all these samples are influenced by mixing as also shown by their hydrochemical composition see fig 4 these more isotopically depleted waters are located near the center and in deeper parts of the aquifer i e bechem voort sands and are being more strongly influenced by cation exchange see fig 4 ch4 production and or oxidation of organic matter than the rest of the sampled groundwater these and other processes influence the total c composition coetsiers and walraevens 2009 which in turn is reflected in the 14c activities fig 6b as shown in fig 6b a broad range of 14c activities were measured near the center of the aquifer serving as an indication of mixing processes occurring here in and around the center of the aquifer from where the aquifer is thicker than about 75 m to the east northeast where the aquifer thickens up to a depth of around 130 m young old mixing line fig 11 the presence of 3h was detected at the same time only in the deepest samples 4herad was found demonstrating that in the shallow part of the aquifer an important modern recharge fraction is present gil márquez et al 2020 in the central part of the aquifer within the diest sands groundwater contains a fraction of natural tritium from the pre bomb pulse era where 4herad predominates for a selection of samples l 64b r 34c and r 2c in the deepest parts of the aquifer with filters located right above the boom clay it can be assumed that the total 4he is equal to 4herad as virtually no other significant sources of 4he occur at these depths younger water does not reach these depths despite the presence of some faults in the vicinity fig 11 in the shallow parts of the aquifer and to the west where the total thickness of the aquifer is lower than 75 m local groundwater flow systems prevail with strong 3h signatures reflecting modern groundwater recharge in some shallow samples a relatively large 14c model age and 4herad can be found suggesting groundwater discharges in some areas with older components most likely originating from deeper parts of the aquifer 5 conclusion and recommendation in this work the age distribution and groundwater flow systems were studied in a lowland catchment in flanders belgium by the integrated use of stable isotopes hydrochemistry and radioactive tracers and their derived apparent ages the coexistence of 4herad together with 3h and 14c in several sampled wells pointed to the mixture of groundwater with both old and young fractions with the use of particle tracking it became clear that several flow paths with different origins converge in a single location i e modern meteoric water pre bomb pulse era displaying a wide range of residence times ranging from 0 up to 50 k years although 14c model ages go up to a maximum of 35 k years the information derived from age tracers together with the results from a previously developed groundwater flow model and hydrochemical characterization allowed us to validate the hypothesis regarding the distribution of groundwater flow systems i local flow systems in the shallow part of the neogene aquifer and ii semi regional flow system at the deepest areas the apparent age estimates were verified with the use of a particle tracking simulation resulting in an acceptable agreement between observed and modelled values for groundwater ages in the ranges of 0 to 100 years as well as for those 1000 years old the use of 3h 3he as a dating tool is acceptable to estimate the apparent age at shallow depths 100 m and to the west where the aquifer thins out and where groundwater of recent meteoric origin is predominant 14c activities and related model ages can be adequately used to distinguish groundwater with an older origin from the centre to the eastern part of the study area and to evaluate flow systems as well as identify potential discharge zones with a distinct old groundwater fraction additionally the 14c model ages show an acceptable agreement to the residence time values modelled with particle tracking showing that the processes and reactions considered by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 are adequate for evaluating groundwater residence times in the neogene aquifer the 4herad concentrations were found to be larger in the samples closest to the boom clay underlying the aquifer indicating that the flux entering at the bottom of the aquifer from i boom clay in situ and ii deeper i e crustal mantle flux sources are potentially the larger contributors to the total 4herad however low 4herad was found in the upper parts of the aquifer suggesting that 4herad concentrations are diluted with the young flow components and in the western part of the aquifer where semi confining layers are not present degassing of 4herad could occur groundwater with ages in the range of 100 up to 1000 years is likely a mixture between fractions of old and young groundwater derived by the combination of the local and intermediate flow systems the limitations of the currently used age tracers suggest that additional tracers e g 39ar with a half life of 269 years may be useful to close the age gap between 3h 3he and 14c apparent age estimates in combination with 4he age model estimates this would allow us to identify the potential flow fractions converging and mixing near the centre of the aquifer and to further constrain the groundwater age distribution based on the findings of this work we demonstrated the applicability of age tracers to validate the applicability of a numerical model of groundwater flow for the evaluation of groundwater flow systems and their conjoint used to advance the conceptualization of the aquifer dynamics furthermore being able to incorporate diverse sources of information from numerical models to hydrochemistry into a joint conceptualization allows us to provide a more faithful representation of the aquifer system important in the decision making process from groundwater management supply to safety and feasibility of waste disposal systems in future work quantification of the additional sources contributing to the total 4herad determination of 4he model age and the study of additional environmental tracers e g 39ar are recommended this study serves as an example of how the use of multiple tracers i e hydrochemistry and stable and radioactive tracers together with hydrodynamic ages from particle tracking can improve the understanding of the circulation of groundwater in a lowland aquifer system at the catchment scale relevant

8539,apparent groundwater age dating has been proven useful and robust in understanding water origin and mixing processes particularly when multiple tracers are considered however even though now extensively used the age tracers have not been widely applied in the general practice of flow and transport model calibration a multi tracer study was carried out in the neogene aquifer in flanders to quantify the apparent age and construct a joint interpretation for the delineation of different groundwater flow systems this understanding is critical as part of the safety and feasibility studies for the underlying boom clay formation that has been considered as a potential host rock for the geological disposal of radioactive waste in this study we combine evidence from tritium helium 3 3h 3he helium 4 4he and radiocarbon 14c dating as well as stable isotopic δ18o δ2h and hydrochemical signatures in combination with particle tracking based age distributions from the 3d groundwater flow model the results of the study indicate that mixing of groundwater with young and old fractions occurs predominantly in the central part of the aquifer which is made evident by the coexistence of 3h pre and post bomb pulse era 14c and 4he in several groundwater samples the mixing between water of different origin is also supported by the sampled stable isotopic and hydrochemical composition of groundwater particle tracking residence time results show an acceptable agreement with apparent ages derived from age tracers for young 100 years and old 1000 years groundwater groundwater with ages between 100 and 1000 years is likely a mixture of water with young old fractions and shows the strongest discrepancies between advective model ages and age tracer based apparent ages on the basis of our findings we distinguish between three groundwater flow systems in the neogene aquifer i a shallow local flow system with groundwater originating from modern meteoric water ii a deep semi regional flow system characterized by old groundwater where the presence of 4herad is significant iii a mixed zone of groundwater flow where the recently infiltrated meteoric water mixes with discharging old groundwater these results have helped us to refine previously proposed conceptual models for the study area and will in the end reduce uncertainties relevant to the potential future geological disposal of radioactive waste keywords radioactive isotopes hydrochemistry age tracers groundwater age distribution groundwater residence time belgium data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction assessing the characteristics and spatial patterns of groundwater flow and its chemical and isotopic composition is fundamental for understanding hydrogeological systems the sustainability of these water reservoirs has recently gained a particular interest as a result of the increased stress on global water resources due to climate change and increased groundwater consumption jasechko et al 2017 petersen et al 2018 bierkens and wada 2019 cuthbert et al 2019 gleeson et al 2020 it is therefore critical to evaluate the potential repercussions on groundwater

important role in better understanding groundwater systems e g groundwater age distributions mixing processes water origin recharge conditions phillips and castro 2013 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 they can be used separately to evaluate a specific age range however if strong mixing of flow components with different origins and varying residence times is occurring the estimated apparent age would be biased corcho alvarado et al 2007 stolp et al 2010 gardner and heilweil 2014 this is more likely to take place in long screened wells where the intersection with several flow lines with different residence times flow paths and recharge areas is expected stolp et al 2010 suckow 2014 gil márquez et al 2020 additionally tracers may be influenced by physiochemical processes e g dilution degradation dispersion diffusion that might alter their concentrations resulting in uncertain apparent ages sanford 1997 solomon and cook 2000 cook 2020 numerous multi tracer studies have been performed to overcome these uncertainties lehmann et al 2003 stadler et al 2010 plummer et al 2012 gardner and heilweil 2014 for instance cendón et al 2020 used a combination of 14c 3h and stable isotopes measurements to characterize the groundwater residence times and aid water management strategies in maputo mozambique old groundwater age tracers 36cl 4he 14c have been used by müller et al 2016 and kulongoski et al 2008 in najd oman and in the amadeus basin in central australia respectively to test their applicability at different sections of the assumed flow paths and to determine the sources of groundwater additionally the conjoint use of 3h 4he 14c hydrochemical signatures and stable isotopes has also been applied to identify the mechanisms of recharge and respective climatic conditions by pärn et al 2019 in the baltic artesian basin in northern estonia and by walraevens et al 2020 for the ledo paniselian aquifer in belgium in addition age tracers can be potentially useful for parameterization of groundwater models turnadge and smerdon 2014 mccallum et al 2015 the integration of all available information on physical and chemical state variables and material properties into numerical models can aid us to advance our current knowledge and to further assess the responses of groundwater systems to different potential disturbances cohen shacham et al 2016 dentzer et al 2017 petersen et al 2018 bowen et al 2019 dillon et al 2019 however only a few studies have combined apparent groundwater ages or the raw tracer concentrations with 3d numerical models sanford 2011 müller et al 2016 as described in detail by schilling et al 2019 the use of age tracers and information of groundwater residence time can be beneficial for flow model calibration on the other hand advective ages from numerical models can be compared with tracer ages to test the validity of assumptions used in respective models and refine the conceptual understanding of the studied systems reilly et al 1994 suckow 2014 as a first step prior to integrating the physical and chemical state variable information into numerical models this work focuses on the evaluation of groundwater flow patterns in the neogene aquifer belgium by comparing the apparent ages derived from age tracers and advective ages derived from a numerical model the neogene aquifer in the lowland nete catchment in flanders has been subject of several studies due to its regional importance as the main groundwater reservoir coetsiers and walraevens 2006 2009 and due to the potential use of the underlying boom clay formation as a host formation for the installation of a radioactive waste repository van keer et al 1999 gedeon 2008 beerten et al 2010 ondraf niras 2010 2013 vandersteen et al 2013 rogiers et al 2015 previous studies have been performed in the neogene aquifer to describe its hydrochemical characteristics coetsiers and walraevens 2006 coetsiers 2007 to study groundwater residence times by using 14c model ages coetsiers and walraevens 2009 to quantify fluxes with the use of temperature measurements and dilution tests rogiers et al 2015 and to evaluate groundwater flow systems by numerical modelling gedeon 2008 casillas trasvina et al 2021 in this research the apparent age distribution in the neogene aquifer is studied by a multi tracer approach using 14c 3h 3he and the accumulation of 4herad with the support of δ18o and δ2h hydrochemistry and particle tracking it is the first multi tracer study performed in the region the main objectives of this contribution are to i characterize groundwater flow systems using apparent tracer ages in combination with hydrochemical and stable isotope evidence and ii complement the conceptual flow model of the region by comparing its advective transport particle tracking ages with apparent model ages and 4he accumulation further understanding of these aspects is of utmost importance in the framework of geological disposal of radioactive waste and for the future use of age tracer concentrations as additional state variables for numerical modelling inverse conditioning at the catchment scale 2 study area and hydrogeological settings the neogene aquifer is located in the campine area in the northeast of flanders fig 1 a and b and considered to be the most important groundwater reservoir in the region coetsiers and walraevens 2006 flanders is characterized by a temperate oceanic climate in general summers are relatively cool and rainy and winters are relatively mild and wet the mean temperature in the area varies from 3 c to 19 c from winter to summer respectively with a mean annual precipitation of 899 mm a full description of the study area has been presented elsewhere casillas trasvina et al 2021 for brevity only a summary is given here the area is characterized by low relief with altitudes ranging from 5 to 70 m above taw tweede algemene waterpassing the hydrography is characterized by an east west drainage system that belongs mainly to the scheldt river basin van keer et al 1999 rogiers et al 2014 see fig 2 the aquifer is composed of neogene marine sand deposits that exert some variations on the hydrochemical composition the groundwater however is in general weakly mineralized coetsiers and walraevens 2008 the oligocene rupelian and mio pliocene geology of the study area is presented in fig 1b the lithology consists of fine to medium grained sands with some clay content in certain units e g kasterlee lillo and diest formations while basal gravels are sometimes present between the units laga et al 2001 the sediments dip towards the north northeast with a gentle slope of about 1 2 in the eastern north eastern part of the study area faults occur as a consequence of the development of the roer valley graben rvg the northwestern part of the lower rhine graben coetsiers and walraevens 2008 verbeeck et al 2017 deckers et al 2018 the most important of these faults in terms of cenozoic offset is the rauw fault which is proven to have been active during the pleistocene verbeeck et al 2017 the effects of the rauw fault zone on the distribution of fluxes and hydraulic head fig 2 has been thoroughly discussed by casillas trasvina et al 2021 for a more detailed description please refer to verbeeck et al 2017 late quaternary deposits mostly fluvial and aeolian sands overlie the neogene units and constitute the upper few meters of the aquifer system the hydrostratigraphical units occurring below these are composed the of plio pleistocene sediments these consists of the malle merksplas mol and lillo sands overlying the miocene kasterlee formation a mixed clayey sandy unit deposited in shallow marine to estuarine conditions it is followed by the miocene diest sands overlaying the late oligocene and lower miocene voort and berchem sands these latter three formations contain significant amounts of glauconite and clay in the form of thin layers finally the boom clay an oligocene marine sediment forms the lower boundary of the system for a more detailed description of the hydrostratigraphy of the area and the boom clay please refer to laga et al 2001 coetsiers and walraevens 2008 yu et al 2013 and vandenberghe et al 2014 notwithstanding their lithological differences patyn et al 1989 concluded from hydrogeological observations that these sediments behave as a single aquifer similarly to casillas trasvina et al 2021 in this work groundwater in the quaternary pleistocene upper and lower pliocene deposits together with the oligocene and lower miocene sands is referred to as the neogene aquifer the hydraulic head distribution in the studied portion of the neogene aquifer is shown in fig 2 an overview of hydraulic conductivity values used in the nam model by casillas trasvina et al 2021 is presented in table 1 the overall groundwater hydrochemistry of the aquifer has been comprehensively described by coetsiers and walraevens 2006 and coetsiers 2007 in general the sediments at shallow depths 50 m below surface are well flushed and decalcified in most of the area this leads to shallow groundwater being characterized by relatively low ph values and weakly mineralization ec values of 250 us cm or lower coetsiers and walraevens 2006 in the western part of the aquifer amounts of calcite have been reported which can react with infiltrating water however it may play an important role only in the deeper parts of the aquifer near the berchem voort sands where the calculated saturation index si is estimated to vary from 7 to 0 with a mean value around 1 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 also in the deepest parts of the aquifer calcite dissolution plays an important role the oxidation of pyrite by o2 or no3 causes high so4 2 concentrations in shallow groundwater coetsiers and walraevens 2006 additionally reduced iron is released to the solution from oxides and hydroxides in these reducing conditions coetsiers and walraevens 2009 organic matter degradation plays a significant role in the general hydrochemistry of the aquifer coetsiers and walraevens 2009 a redox sequence is followed where o2 is reduced first then no3 after which mn oxide and fe hydr oxide reduction occurs followed by so4 2 reduction and finally methanogenesis given that ch4 production occurs at the same redox potential as so4 2 reduction it was deduced that it is taking place in the deepest parts of the neogene aquifer fig 1c coetsiers and walraevens 2006 also in the deep part of the aquifer an increase in na is observed as a result of cation exchange the latter decreases the ca2 concentration initiating a second stage of calcite dissolution and increasing the hco3 concentrations walraevens 1990 coetsiers and walraevens 2006 these processes have been evaluated by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 by considering the different 14c dilution reactions that are geochemically aging the groundwater from coetsiers and walraevens 2009 recent dissolved organic matter is concluded to play an important role in the redox reactions resulting in 14c model ages between 0 6 and 6 5 k years however these ages might not be representative for the whole aquifer as the deepest areas of the aquifer were not sampled 3 methodology 3 1 sampling procedures the groundwater samples investigated in this study were collected in march 2019 a total of 22 piezometers at 8 selected locations were sampled across the nete catchment within the neogene aquifer fig 2 these piezometers are being monitored by sck cen the groundwater samples were analysed for stable water isotopes 3h 3he 4he 14c and ions the sampling strategy was focused on getting a complete data set which includes hydrochemical composition major and minor ions trace elements and isotopic data at each sampling site earlier campaigns have been performed in the area by rogiers et al unpublished work 2016 van keer et al 1999 and coetsiers and walraevens 2006 2009 from which their collected data have been compiled in this work an overview of the collected samples per campaign is shown in table 2 two different submergible pumps were used during the whole 2019 campaign the geotech ss geosub pump https www geotechenv com geotech ss geosub html and the grundfos mp1 pump https www envieq com grundfos mp1 best solution both pumps have similar characteristics allowing one to control the flow down to rates as low as 100 ml min the parameters measured on site include ph electrical conductivity ec and redox potential eh with the use of portable probes and a flow through cell before any sampling the wellbores were purged at least 3 casing volumes and sampled until an apparent stabilization of field parameters was observed when possible 1 1 two wells namely r 54c and r 54e below the boom clay were not fully flushed pumping rates were low at these locations because of potential issues with the filter and or low hydraulic conductivity of the surrounding sediments thus samples were taken without complete purging particularly for r 54e only bursts of groundwater were possible to be abstracted and collected this was done to obtain representative samples of in situ groundwater with minimum disturbance of the flow system and the collected sample different sampling bottles were used depending on the hydrochemical analysis to be performed transparent polyethylene pe brown glass and green glass bottles bottles were acidified with 1 ml of h2so4 for cation analyses in accordance with standard methods for preservation of groundwater samples for a detailed list of the parameters to be measured from each bottle see the electronic supplementary material esm 1 the procedure for noble gas sampling of groundwater using copper tubes described by vandersteen et al 2017 was followed collecting samples in duplicates this procedure is based on the provided guidelines by helis sültenfuβ et al 2009 the laboratory for helium isotopes studies of the university of bremen https www noblegas uni bremen de these copper tubes were closed vacuum tight by stainless steel clamps at both ends for 3h δ13c and 14c two air tight 1 liter pe bottles were filled with groundwater dissolved inorganic carbon dic was analysed for δ13c and 14c at the isotopetech zrt laboratory https www isotoptech eu en all samples were stored in a laboratory refrigerator at 4 c until the submission to the respective laboratories for analyses 3 2 analytical methods different methods were applied the majority of the major hydrochemical components were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms the concentrations of fe2 fe 3 nh4 no3 no2 cl and po4 2 were measured by molecular spectrometry the quality of the analytical results of the measured ions was evaluated by determining their ionic balance errors threshold 5 additionally the water types of all groundwater samples have been classified following stuyfzand 1986 stable isotopes δ18o 2h and δ13c were analysed by gasbench isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms with an analytical precision of 0 15 2 0 1 respectively hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios are expressed in standard delta per mil

filters were used to analyse for the δ13c and for 14c activity correction of the initial 14c activity was applied following the model procedure outlined by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 built for the same aquifer the 14c correction model by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 quantifies the contribution of c in groundwater recharge calcite dissolution oxidation of organic matter and methane ch4 formation to the inorganic c pool and its influence on the 14c activity an estimate of c originating from these processes is made with the use of ca2 fe2 so4 2 and hco3 concentrations the δ13c values

advective transport model a modflow 2005 harbaugh et al 2005 steady state groundwater flow model has been developed for the nete catchment by casillas trasvina et al 2021 a short summary of the model set up is presented here the model was discretized in 49 vertical layers the thickness of the first three layers was set to 50 80 and 100 of the ground surface elevation above sea level taw hence the bottom of the third layer is a flat plane at 0 m asl from layer 4 to 9 each layer is 5 m thick while layers from 10 to 49 have a thickness of 10 m the modelled area was discretized into a regular model grid of 96 rows and 146 columns resulting in cells with dimensions of 400 m 400 m the latest hydrostratigraphic 3d model of flanders by deckers et al 2019 is used resulting in 9 hydrogeological units using the modflow s hydrogeologic unit flow package non tabular quaternary quaternary above campine aquifer system and the weelde malle merksplas mol lillo kasterlee diest and berchem voort formations additionally the faults included in the h3d model were also implemented a total of 23 faults were simulated with the horizontal flow barrier hfb package harbaugh et al 2005 starting from the top of the second numerical layer 12 18 m below ground surface to the bottom of the modelled domain given that the faults do not present a clear surface expression verbeeck et al 2017 distributed recharge values derived from vegetation cover soil texture and depth to the groundwater table were obtained from diciacca 2020 and included as a specified flux condition internal specified sinks sources were abstraction wells from the flemish environment agency vlaamse milieumaatschappij vmm and rivers and ditches obtained from the flemish hydrographic atlas vlaamse hydrografische atlas vmm 2017 and the ign ngi dataset ign ngi 2017 are implemented through the wel river and drain packages respectively the horizontal hydraulic conductivities of each hydrogeological unit a recharge scaling factor the hydraulic properties of the faults as well as river and drain conductance were calibrated using the global standard particle swarm optimization spso11 scheme clerc et al 2012 zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2013 a total of 1393 averaged hydraulic head observation values were used as observations targets during the calibration procedure the resulting head distribution is shown in fig 2 the steady state modflow flow field solution forms the basis for the advective transport simulation performed using modpath pollock 2016 backward particle tracking from the well screen to its recharge location is simulated with modpath and allows us to determine the residence time of each particle the travel time of each released particle in a cell is determined by modpath based on the modflow cell by cell flow rate the cell by cell flow rate is controlled by the prescribed recharge and the hydraulic conductivity of every hydrogeological formation following konikow et al 2008 in order to ensure stability particles were evenly distributed 10 10 10 in the model cell where the well screen is located the simulated distribution of particle residence times at each well was then compared to the corresponding tracer derived apparent ages e g 3h 3he 14c 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical composition the initial characterization of the hydrochemistry of the neogene aquifer was presented by coetsiers and walraevens 2006 here we will present the results from the current work in relation to the previous results the well id screen depth sampling date the stuyfzand 1986 water type classification and isotope values for the sampled wells during the current campaign are shown in table 3 for the complete set of analysed results see esm 2 for most of the samples the error on the ionic balance was smaller than 5 however in some cases denoted with in table 3 the error was higher up to 11 for these cases the σc σa 5 meq l sum of anions sum of cations indicated that these are weakly mineralized waters thus this error may be acceptable walraevens 2000 for 2 cases denoted with in table 2 the σc σa 5 meq l and the error amounts to 10 the stuyfzand 1986 classification was applied to the chemical data included in table 3 all the groundwater samples in the neogene aquifer have cl 150 mg l indicating fresh fresh oligohaline waters codes f and g respectively and very soft to hard to 2 on the other hand the groundwater sample taken from below the boom clay presents a value of 1790 mg cl l and is classified as a brackish salt water type code b the obtained results are in accordance with the published results of coetsiers and walraevens 2006 for regional characterization of the neogene aquifer groundwater sampled in shallow wells is found to be camix naso4 cahco3 or caso4 water type according to coetsiers and walraevens 2006 pyrite oxidation in the unsaturated zone is responsible for the occurrence of these water types since calcite is not present there calcite dissolution only plays an important role in the deeper parts of the aquifer and towards the north also silicate weathering increases sio2 and cation concentrations along the groundwater flow direction high so4 2 concentrations are found in the shallow groundwater wells are caused by the oxidation of pyrite by means of o2 or no3 coetsiers and walraevens 2006 the oxidation of organic matter increases the hco3 content leading to the occurrence of the types cahco3 and camix additionally cation exchange was observed in the deepest wells manifested by the increase in na and mg2 concentrations in groundwater together with a a decrease in ca2 concentration the lowering of ca2 in groundwater causes a second stage of calcite dissolution which results in higher hco3 levels walraevens 1990 the groundwater type changes to cahco3 still very soft and then nahco3 here indicating the influence of cation exchange of the freshening type coetsiers et al 2004 this evolution is presented in a piper diagram in fig 3 on the left side of the piper diagram the evolution from cahco3 to nahco3 type fig 4 is indicated by the samples plotting near the na k axis due to the influence of cation exchange of the freshening type however samples plotting on the upper right side of the piper diagram suggest either salinization not in this case or some other processes e g pyrite oxidation with an increase in so4 2 which is the case for the neogene aquifer the pink arrow reflects the subsequent water types encountered along a flow line for piezometer r 54e with filter below the boom clay the water type reflects the presence of connate waters of nacl type originating from seawater infiltrating groundwater in various shallow piezometers within the first 50 m presents slightly higher cl values around 50 85 mg l this might be attributed either to infiltrating waters evapotranspiration processes occurring near the surface and or to land use e g fertilizer sewage water road de icing leading to the nacl type at the same time the lower cl concentrations could belong to groundwater from pre industrial era further down the groundwater flowline similarly to walraevens 1990 the groundwater quality evolution as a result from freshening is shown in fig 4 in this figure cl concentration increases with the verticalflow direction where nacl water types are found below the boom clay from deeper to shallower dilution of deep connate water takes place in the upper part of the fresh saltwater interface na concentration increases in a mixing zone leading to nahco3 water types due to cation exchange being derived from the desorption of marine cations in the na ca2 exchange lastly the evolution from mghco3 to cahco3 water type is found in the freshened recharge area where cation exchange is not playing a determining role any more walraevens 1990 2000 coetsiers and walraevens 2006 2008 coetsiers 2007 the spatial evolution of some groundwater quality components and further description of the groundwater chemistry is presented in the esm 3 4 2 stable isotopes composition stable isotope analyses δ2h and δ18o and radioisotope measurements have been carried out in order to obtain information on the origin of the waters and its recharge conditions results of the analyses are presented in table 3 available monthly data from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip were retrieved from the international atomic energy agency iaea https www iaea org services networks gnip from 1980 to 1990 the data were collected from three stations beek liege and gilzen rijen located in the surroundings of tilburg and breda being the closest stations to the study area the gnip data were used to construct the local meteoric water line lmwl providing the average relationship between hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic compositions in precipitation the lmwl is described by the equation δ d 6 918 δ 18 o 1 97 r 2 0 95 the global meteoric water line gmwl is described as δ d 8 δ 18 o 10 as given by craig 1961 regarding the stable isotope contents the values varied between 53 3 and 40 5 for δ2h and between 7 83 and 6 1 for δ18o a scatter plot of δ18o and δ2h of the groundwater samples in shown in fig 5 the clustering of a large number of groundwater samples around the lmwl indicates that local modern meteoric water is a significant source of groundwater recharge coplen et al 2011 porowski 2014 however some of the samples fall slightly below both the gmwl and the lmwl showing lighter δ2h isotopes still within the range measured from precipitation waters in gnip stations this might be attributed to the proximity of the evaporation source i e the north sea oiro et al 2018 and or to evapotranspiration differentiating the isotopic composition of groundwater and that isotopic enrichment of overlying soil water is transferred to groundwater and streams as a distinct isotopic signal as pointed out by kalvāns et al 2020 the groundwater regression line derived from the collected samples following δ d 6 158 δ 18 o 2 72 r 2 0 76 presents a lower slope than the gmwl and a negative intercept intercept 2 72 slope 6 158 suggesting the potential effect of evaporative enrichment on groundwater wassenaar et al 2011 joshi et al 2018 or the presence of a fraction of evaporated seawater piezometers presenting more negative values than those of surface waters i e from the same well with shallower filters e g r 34c r 2c r 16b might be indicative of wells recharged with a mixture including older ground waters i e older than waters derived from modern precipitation during potentially colder climatic conditions clark and fritz 1997 wassenaar et al 2011 4 3 groundwater age tracers 4 3 1 carbon 13 δ 13 and radiocarbon 14c the results for δ13c and 14c activity are presented in table 3 for the 22 groundwater samples the values of δ13c vary between 22 to 8 8 following similar ranges and patterns as those presented by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 however r 54e below the boom clay presents a δ13c value of 1 serving as an indication of isotopic enrichment potentially caused by methanogenesis the lowest values can be found at around 150 to 200 m depth mostly in the diest sands while δ13c values tend to generally increase with depth the initial δ13c values are largely determined by the degree of fractionation during photosynthetic plant uptake ehleringer and vogel 1993 vogel 1993 for belgium with a moderate climate vegetation follows the c3 photosynthetic cycle with δ13c values of around 25 as a result of co2 degassing following the decomposition of organic matter cerling et al 1991 the fractionation occurs with the hydrolysis of dissolved co2 to hco3 leading to an increase of δ13c values in groundwater with ph around 7 leybourne et al 2006 the results of the analysed samples taken from the neogene aquifer probably follow similar processes initially but organic matter oxidation in the saturated zone plays a role as well as very low δ13c values are encountered down to 22 a summarized description of the processes influencing the total c composition is presented next including the results from the current work and the work from coetsiers and walraevens 2006 for a more detailed description of these processes the reader is referred to coetsiers and walraevens 2009 a set of plots comparing δ13c 14c and the advective transport particle tracking ages are presented in fig 6 the comparison of the δ13c and 14c values following the approximate flow direction shown in fig 2 suggest an evolution of both parameters fig 6 a and b this can more clearly be seen by plotting the resulting values from this research together with the results from analyses from previous works and projects carried out in the area values of δ13c slightly increase from the recharge younger groundwater to the discharge area from 25 to around 12 this is mainly related to the redox processes linked to the total c composition the δ13c value higher than 5 indicates the sample taken from below the boom clay where the total c is more largely influenced by sulphate reduction and potentially methane production the 14c values decrease with as age increases along the flow direction with the groundwater parcel a few larger values of δ13c around 10 occur where the advective age is low this might also indicate the presence of i local recharge areas and ii the influence of the local river network on the local groundwater flow coetsiers and walraevens 2009 the relation of δ13c and 14c is shown in fig 6c although it can be roughly seen that most 14c values decrease with the increase of δ13c values with some anomalies this suggests that the radioactive decay is being overwritten by hydrochemical reaction involving carbon increasing the complexity of the system appelo and postma 2005 this shows the absolute necessity of taking these hydrochemical reactions into account when interpreting 14c ages the relation of δ13c with several other groundwater components is presented in esm 4 the results obtained from the laboratory analysis performed on the samples in the current campaign closely follow the results presented by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 and support and validate the representativeness of the findings of the analysed findings for these reasons the results from the hydrochemical analysis and data processing were further used to correct the initial 14c activities 4 3 2 corrected radiocarbon 14c activities and related apparent ages the major reactions occurring in the neogene aquifer are presented in the previous section for the samples taken during the current work and seem to be in good agreement with the results of coetsiers and walraevens 2009 however the exact contribution to the total c from these reactions need to be quantified and therefore a correction model is applied to the 14c initial activities the concentrations of these components and their contributions to the total c originating from calcite dissolution oxidation of organic matter and ch4 production is presented in the esm 4 additionally a detailed description on the application of the correction model for 14c initial activity is included in the esm 4 as well here a brief summary is provided the 14c measured values range from 1 6 to 160 pmc table 3 several piezometers i e r 11a r 51a r 6a r 6b present values above 100 pmc these wells have filters deeper than 50 m the high values in these wells would indicate young groundwater being recharged during the post bomb pulse era 1955 due to the 14c produced during atmospheric nuclear tests gallagher et al 2000 atkinson et al 2014 cartwright et al 2017 with a significantly shorter half life i e 12 32 yr tritium 3h can be used more effectively to date these younger groundwaters jasechko 2016 lindsey et al 2019 van keer et al 1999 previously compared models for correction of 14c activities i e vogel tamers pearson mook f g iaea evans eichinger in the same region concluding that these models produced relatively similar results 1 ky emphasis was put on the pearson 1965 model within the framework of the phymol project however these models are not as robust as required for the neogene aquifer since they only consider a few reactions for the sake of quality control we first reproduced the results obtained by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 to validate our workflow and then applied the method to on the 14c activities obtained during this study see section 3 3 1 the results of these calculations are presented in table 4 and described in more detail in esm 4 the relation between measured and calculated δ13c values show a good agreement demonstrating that the assumed contributions to the total c pool from these reactions describe the real situation sufficiently as shown in esm 4 the c fractions of the c sources are given in percentages together with 14c measured activity in table 4 the initial amount of 14c before the occurrence of radioactive decay is then determined by verifying which c fractions contain 14c initially by international convention it is accepted that c originating from the soil pre nuclear detonation contains 100 pmc 14c cook 2020 iaea 2003 iaea 1970 mook 2000 2014 c originating from calcite dissolution is usually fossil 0 pmc negative model ages were obtained if crecharge was left as the only c source considering that the organic matter being oxidized is originated from the matrix and is fossil a14c 0 pmc this indicates that recent dissolved organic matter with initial 14c 100 pmc in recharge water plays an important role in the redox processes occurring in the aquifer coetsiers and walraevens 2009 when taking this into account the majority of the samples present 14c ages corrected and uncorrected in the range of 1kyr to 10kyr with some negative values the rather younger model ages belong to shallow wells close to the surface the obtained apparent ages fall inside the holocene period indicating the relatively young age and rapid groundwater circulation in the shallow parts of the system this especially applies to water in the diest sands and overlaying formations however the corrected 14c model ages for samples r 2c r 34c and r 54c resulted in larger age estimates from 15 to 33kyr these wells are located in the deepest parts of the aquifer in the late oligocene and lower miocene formations of berchem voort sands i e r 2c and r 34c and eigenbilzen i e r 54c these formations are characterized by relatively low hydraulic conductivities of around 0 5 m d within an area in the surroundings of the rauw fault zone where groundwater flow is nearly stagnant casillas trasvina et al 2021 following this rationale 14c model ages indicate that groundwater residence times increase with depth and are longest near the bottom of the neogene aquifer influenced by the very low groundwater fluxes according to coetsiers and walraevens 2009 the corrected 14c ages obtained with the applied correction model will be an overestimation of the real age if part of the oxidized organic matter originated from the fossil matrix instead of being dissolved in the groundwater depending on the contribution of the fossil organic matter the real groundwater ages will vary between zero and the model age given that the results following the coetsiers and walraevens 2009 model are already an overestimation of the real groundwater ages the results from the pearson 1965 model fall in an even more conservative i e older side the pearson 1965 model largely overestimates the age when the measured 14c activity is low in relation to the coetsiers and walraevens 2009 model producing older corrected apparent ages for high 14c activities younger groundwater the modelled ages get relatively close to the model ages of coetsiers and walraevens 2009 model while still giving relatively older model ages gallagher et al 2000 discuss the usage of the mass balance approach and conclude that it is desirable to take into account all important reactions involving dissolved inorganic carbon in the mass transfer calculations extensive chemistry data are however needed for such an approach since insufficient data was acquired during the phymol project van keer et al 1999 to apply the correction model by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 the uncertainty of their calculated 14c model ages is probably substantial thus these model ages calculated for those samples should therefore be used with caution and only as an indication of the magnitude of the potentially upper limit of the groundwater 14c model age 4 3 3 tritium the 3h measured activity is presented in table 4 all samples contain 3h ranging from 0 01 to 12 4 tu with two comparatively large values in samples r 6a and r 6b of 177 4 and 66 7 tu respectively for these 2 samples to this date we don t have an explanation for these large tu observations samples with higher 3h activities than 1 5 i e r 11a r 16a r 34a r 51a r 6a r 6b have filters at shallow depths up to a maximum of 48 m below ground surface bgs the 3h 3he apparent ages for these wells are in the range of very recently recharged waters to waters recharged in the last few tens of years basically having a modern origin thus they characterize the youngest groundwater component measured in the aquifer the high 3h activities at these locations are consistent with their high measured 14c activities close to 100 pmc due to which their 14c corrected model ages resulted in negative values however tracers indicate short residence time also for wells r 16c and r 6d at depths of 176 and 328 m bgs respectively with negative 14c model ages but with positive uncorrected ages a relatively high measured 14c activity and rather high 3h activities both of these wells are located in the berchem voort sands at different ends north south ern of the rauw fault zone at the boundary of the roer valley graben see fig 2 the effect of the rauw fault zone on the distribution of flow has been described by casillas trasvina et al 2021 suggesting that groundwater with a variation of apparent ages might coexists in certain areas where groundwater flowlines converge in locations near the fault zones this could explain the young tracer based apparent ages in these deeper wells for samples l 64a r 16b r 2b r 34b r 54a r 54c and r 6c the measured 3h activity was below 0 1 this indicates that these waters have a rather large proportion of tritium free and or low tritium groundwater infiltrated before 1955 resulting in 3h 3he apparent ages of 66 years i e in the range from 70 to 150 years gil márquez et al 2020 a scatter plot of the apparent ages derived by the 3h 3he method versus the corrected 14c model ages is shown in fig 7 here the samples containing a mixture of tritium and tritium free groundwater above the year 1955 ce line in the 3h 3he axis and higher than 0 in the 14c apparent ages axis have a fehco3 cahco3 or nahco3 water subtype the water in the diest sands and berchem voort sands is characterized by groundwater with these water subtypes as shown in fig 1 and as presented by coetsiers and walraevens 2006 this serves as an indication of the zones where water mixing with a stronger dominance of older components takes place in the neogene aquifer by the presence of young and old age tracers in the same collected water sample on the other hand samples in overlaying formations characterized by caso4 camix and naso4 water subtypes with shallower filters have more tritium rich waters with negative 14c model ages 4 3 4 helium 4 the plausibility of the calculated 3h 3he and 14c model ages can be evaluated by analysing them in relation to the accumulation of 4herad in groundwater this relation is shown in fig 8 the 4herad values generally agree with findings derived from corrected 14c and 3h 3he model ages groundwaters with a nahco3 type seem to have a larger accumulation of 4herad 10 5 to 10 3 ccstp kg indicating a longer residence time which agrees with old 14c model ages samples with this water type are found near the bottom of the neogene aquifer in the berchem voort sands or in the deepest parts of the diest sands where the groundwater velocities are considerably lower compared to the rest of the aquifer casillas trasvina et al 2021 in the cahco3 camix caso4 water types the 4herad is significantly lower from 10 6 to 10 5 ccstp kg which agrees with their 14c model ages younger than 10 kyr the 4herad concentration was below detection limit in several samples mainly those near the surface with shallow filters located in quaternary and pliocene formations or on the shallow parts of the diest sands this may be due to the flux velocity at these depths where 4he concentrations get diluted jean baptiste et al 2009 however for samples l 64a r 16c r 2b r 34b r 51a and r 54c the accumulation of 4herad was detected together with the presence of 3h and 14c samples r 16c and r 51a both have large activities of 14c 91 and 100 pmc respectively and 3h 6 3 and 4 9 tu respectively very likely due to a significant component of modern recharge water given the depth at which r 16c is located 137 m in the berchem voort sands the occurrence of 4herad 1 9 10 06 ccstp kg is expected given its closeness to a potentially significant 4herad mass flux source from deeper clay bearing formations at the bottom of the aquifer the boom clay with uranium concentrations from 3 to 4 2 ppm and thorium from 8 to 12 7 ppm from jacops et al 2020 and potentially the mantle however for r 51a with a filter screen at 11 m bgs an accumulation of 7 2 10 06 ccstp kg of 4herad was also detected this well is in the diest sands at the westernmost side of the study area here the neogene aquifer thins to a thickness of 60 m leaving the filter of the well to just a couple tens of meters away from the boom clay samples l 64a r 2b r 34b and r 54c have all 14c values below 55 pmc and 3h below 0 1 tu indicating that a large portion of these waters derived from tritium free groundwater of the pre bomb pulse era with possibly a low fraction of post bomb era recharged groundwater mayer et al 2014 as explained in the previous section additionally casillas trasvina et al submitted 2022 discuss this pattern as shown in heat transport simulations derived by the proximity and density of the river network resulting in local flow systems where several flow lines converge the presence of 4herad here restates the mixing of young and old groundwater occurring in this part of the neogene aquifer the accumulation of 4herad increases with distance along the approximate flow direction see fig 2 groundwater at r 54c in the easternmost location the deepest filter within the neogene aquifer flows in a sub regional deep flow system towards the direction of l 64b potentially receiving inputs from more recently infiltrated groundwater this also agrees with the old 14c model age for this well fig 8 in the western southwestern part the neogene aquifer becomes thinner and the local shallow flow systems start to play a more influential role a mixing zone is generated here with inputs from modern and old groundwater where all three age tracers used in this work 14c 4he 3h are present in the groundwater as shown in wells l 64a and further downstream r 34b and r 2b these filters i e l 64a r 34b and r 2b are all located in the diest sands near the centre of the neogene aquifer with values in the same order of magnitude for the three tracers 3h and 4herad concentrations and 14c model ages at the same locations the deeper filters of the same wells namely l 64b r 34c and r 2c are all located in the berchem voort sands similarly the values for 4herad concentration and 14c model ages are both indicative of long residence times at these locations the 3h concentrations are very low 0 1 tu with non detected 3hetrit fraction meaning these waters have a negligible portion of groundwater with modern origin 1955 the relation between the 3he 4he and the ne he ratios fig 9 can confirm this reasoning allowing the distinction between young and old groundwater mayer et al 2014 samples plotting near the crustal end member 3h 3he ratio of 2 10 8 and ne he ratio of 0 namely l 64b r 34c and r 2c indicate that the production of 4he for these is virtually only of radiogenic origin pärn et al 2019 these samples are characterized by longer residence times and long water rock interaction as described by their 14c model ages see table 4 in these locations he has largely accumulated evolving from equilibrium values to low 3he 4he ratios 2 10 7 where ne he tends towards 0 ballentine and burnard 2002 gil márquez et al 2020 the production of tritiogenic 3he 3hetrit is derived from the decay of 3h in modern water starting from the atmospheric equilibrium concentrations shifting towards higher 3he 4he ratios 1 3 10 6 to 9 10 6 fig 9 the mixture of groundwater with a 4herad and 3hetrit fraction is displayed by a component following the 4herad production with a vertical offset from this line mayer et al 2014 allowing the distinction between young and old ground water for all samples with a ne he ratio above 3 3hetrit values are detected despite some having 3h values lower than 0 1 tu this indicates that they have a portion of modern water with a fraction that is consistent with decay from natural tritium of 2 4 tu cook and herczeg 2000 solomon and cook 2000 mayer et al 2014 samples that are the closest to air saturated water in equilibrium with the atmosphere are characteristic to recently infiltrated groundwater fig 9b 4 3 5 advective age distribution as aforementioned groundwater from different origin has been subjected to mixing in the neogene aquifer resulting in a broad range of estimated apparent ages with the use of a groundwater flow model developed in the context of this research by casillas trasvina et al 2021 an estimation of the distribution of advective ages at each sampled well was performed using modpath 7 pollock 2016 to check whether the estimated model ages from age tracers are consistent with the modelled groundwater flow velocities in fig 10 a and b the distribution of these advective ages is shown for a a cross section with the advective transport particle tracking age at the center of the model cell and b for each observation well location together with the apparent ages derived from 3h 3he the 14c model ages pearson 1965 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 and uncorrected i e conventional 14c model ages fig 10a shows a general picture of the advective age distribution in the aquifer where recharge areas can be idenfied characterized by ages 100 yr at a maximum of 50 m below surface these variations are more apparent being in the mol formation and the areas where the diest formation is nearest to the surface in the western part of the aquifer the areas where the kasterlee formation is near to the surface are characterized by older groundwater ages of around 100 1 000 yr as the kasterlee formation has relatively low hydraulic conductivity 0 6 m d in relation to the sediments above and below 11 5 m d for mol formation and 8 for diest formation respectively hampering the groundwater fluxes the majority of the diest formation is characterized by groundwater ages in the range of 100 1 000 yr with younger groundwaters towards the surface however to the east of the aquifer western of the rauw fault older groundwater ages 1 000 10 000 yr can be depicted these ages are derived from discharging old groundwater from the berchem voort formation at the bottom of the aquifer which is characterized by low hydraulic conductivities 0 5 m d and old groundwater 1 000 and 10 000 yr is some areas although these advective age values are obtained at the center of the groundwater flow model cell they already provide a good approximation of the general age distribution and the distributuon of groundwater flow systems in the aquifer however as discussed by suckow 2014 the distribution of groundwater ages is highly variable as groundwater flow paths from multiple directions may converge in the observation well filter from fig 10b the results of placing particled along the observation well filters are shown depicting a a broad range of ages ranging from recently recharged water residence time of 1 yr up to around 50 kyr groundwater with groundwater flow model advective ages of 100 yr or younger i e r 6a to r 51a show a good agreement with the estimated 3h 3he model apparent with the exception of r 51a 4herad in those samples was not detected in sample r 51a 4herad was detected but its presence is not unexpected given the closeness of the boom clay to this filter additionally all these samples have 14c values 90 pmc consistent with the young advective ages non detected 4herad concentration and 3h 3he derived apparent ages all pointing towards recently recharged groundwater groundwater with ages in the order of hundreds of years up to 1 kyr are characterized mainly by a cahco3 water type i e wells r 6c up to r 34b fig 10 this water type is characteristic to groundwater in the diest sands where the major influence of mixing between yound and old groundwater was identified in the previous sections additionally from this group of samples 4herad was only detected in wells r 2b l 64a and r 34b other samples of this group are also located in the same areas but are from relatively shallower filters and or near the rauw fault zone where modern groundwater fluxes are stronger and more influential casillas trasvina et al 2021 on the other hand the measured 14c activities for all the sampled wells in this group range between 24 up to 67 pmc with coetsiers and walraevens 2009 model ages around 1 1 to 8 2 kyr the advective age distribution at each filter is relatively narrow and unimodal as a consequence of not accounting for mixing by dispersion here dispersion might spread these distributions over a broader range of ages potentially accounting for the older groundwater component with origin from the deeper parts of the aquifer nevertheless coetsiers and walraevens 2009 mention that apparent ages derived by application of their model would likely result in overestimations of the real age due to considering all c form organic matter to be recent indicating a potential upper apparent age limit for the sampled waters coetsiers and walraevens 2009 the advective ages from the groundwater flow model suggest a compromise between young and old groundwater components that the currently used age tracers are unable to resolve given their own limitations e g half life apparent age limits uncertainties in estimations of initial activities here the application of a different age tracer such as ar 39 with a more suitable half life could be desirable clark 2015 finally advective age distributions for samples with model ages above1 kyr are mainly characterized by nahco3 water types distinctive for groundwater in the berchem voort sands and from the deepest parts of the diest sands these distributions tend to show a much broader advective age range with a multi modal shape this spread indicates that particles reaching these filters originate from different locations following different ranges of long and short er flowpaths as has been thoroughly discussed by suckow 2014 and mccallum et al 2014 for the majority of these samples from r 34a to r 16c fig 11 with the exceptions of r 34a and r 6d all contain 4herad concentrations however 4herad values coexist with detectable 3h 3he ages for instance sample r 54c has a filter with a length of 20 m in which a potentially large number of particle flow paths would essentially converge allowing a large number of apparent ages to be estimated suckow 2014 having wells with long filters would therefore increase the uncertainty in the apparent age estimates and thefore explain the concurrence of age tracers of longer half lives together with fraction of younger water characterized by small 3h concentrations in general the estimated 14c apparent ages corrected and or uncorrected for the older groundwaters in the neogene aquifer are within the same order of magnitude as those estimated by advective particle tracking showing an acceptable approximation to the modelled values this confirms that the reactions and processes influencing the total c in the aquifer considered in the correction model by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 are adequate 4 3 6 conceptual model of groundwater ages in the neogene aquifer based on the joint interpretation of model ages and regional advective flow pattern groundwater in the neogene aquifer presents a broad range of estimated apparent ages indicative of a strong mixing of waters with different origin this is supported by several lines of evidence as discussed above fig 11 shows an interpretation of the flow paths carrying groundwater with different ages young and old and their mixture along the hypothesized local intermediate and regional groundwater flow systems to the east of the rauw fault zone fig 11 groundwater flows from east to west across the kasterlee clay formation penetrating to the deepest part of the aquifer this is corraborated by the detection of 3h in sample r 54c where given its depth the presence of tritium and a 3hetrit component would not be expected on this flow path groundwater flow seems to divert into two possible directions i it continues flowing downstream and within the berchem voort sands at a low velocity given its hydraulic conductivity i e 0 5 m d casillas trasvina et al 2021 or ii is disturbed by the rauw fault around the center of the diest formation and diverts vertically upwards implying that vertical fluxes occur along the fault the conduit barrier function of the rauw fault zone and the effects it has on flow paths in its vicinity are thoroughly explored by casillas trasvina et al 2021 and support the observations made in the current work the δ18o and δ2h signatures further support these inferences indicating fig 5 that the majority of groundwater samples have a component of modern meteoric water while modern meteoric water is an important source of groundwater recharge the variation on isotopic composition is indicative of further processes occurring on the water mixture with more depleted isotopic composition also occurring i e wells r 2c r 34c r 54c and l 64b all these samples are influenced by mixing as also shown by their hydrochemical composition see fig 4 these more isotopically depleted waters are located near the center and in deeper parts of the aquifer i e bechem voort sands and are being more strongly influenced by cation exchange see fig 4 ch4 production and or oxidation of organic matter than the rest of the sampled groundwater these and other processes influence the total c composition coetsiers and walraevens 2009 which in turn is reflected in the 14c activities fig 6b as shown in fig 6b a broad range of 14c activities were measured near the center of the aquifer serving as an indication of mixing processes occurring here in and around the center of the aquifer from where the aquifer is thicker than about 75 m to the east northeast where the aquifer thickens up to a depth of around 130 m young old mixing line fig 11 the presence of 3h was detected at the same time only in the deepest samples 4herad was found demonstrating that in the shallow part of the aquifer an important modern recharge fraction is present gil márquez et al 2020 in the central part of the aquifer within the diest sands groundwater contains a fraction of natural tritium from the pre bomb pulse era where 4herad predominates for a selection of samples l 64b r 34c and r 2c in the deepest parts of the aquifer with filters located right above the boom clay it can be assumed that the total 4he is equal to 4herad as virtually no other significant sources of 4he occur at these depths younger water does not reach these depths despite the presence of some faults in the vicinity fig 11 in the shallow parts of the aquifer and to the west where the total thickness of the aquifer is lower than 75 m local groundwater flow systems prevail with strong 3h signatures reflecting modern groundwater recharge in some shallow samples a relatively large 14c model age and 4herad can be found suggesting groundwater discharges in some areas with older components most likely originating from deeper parts of the aquifer 5 conclusion and recommendation in this work the age distribution and groundwater flow systems were studied in a lowland catchment in flanders belgium by the integrated use of stable isotopes hydrochemistry and radioactive tracers and their derived apparent ages the coexistence of 4herad together with 3h and 14c in several sampled wells pointed to the mixture of groundwater with both old and young fractions with the use of particle tracking it became clear that several flow paths with different origins converge in a single location i e modern meteoric water pre bomb pulse era displaying a wide range of residence times ranging from 0 up to 50 k years although 14c model ages go up to a maximum of 35 k years the information derived from age tracers together with the results from a previously developed groundwater flow model and hydrochemical characterization allowed us to validate the hypothesis regarding the distribution of groundwater flow systems i local flow systems in the shallow part of the neogene aquifer and ii semi regional flow system at the deepest areas the apparent age estimates were verified with the use of a particle tracking simulation resulting in an acceptable agreement between observed and modelled values for groundwater ages in the ranges of 0 to 100 years as well as for those 1000 years old the use of 3h 3he as a dating tool is acceptable to estimate the apparent age at shallow depths 100 m and to the west where the aquifer thins out and where groundwater of recent meteoric origin is predominant 14c activities and related model ages can be adequately used to distinguish groundwater with an older origin from the centre to the eastern part of the study area and to evaluate flow systems as well as identify potential discharge zones with a distinct old groundwater fraction additionally the 14c model ages show an acceptable agreement to the residence time values modelled with particle tracking showing that the processes and reactions considered by coetsiers and walraevens 2009 are adequate for evaluating groundwater residence times in the neogene aquifer the 4herad concentrations were found to be larger in the samples closest to the boom clay underlying the aquifer indicating that the flux entering at the bottom of the aquifer from i boom clay in situ and ii deeper i e crustal mantle flux sources are potentially the larger contributors to the total 4herad however low 4herad was found in the upper parts of the aquifer suggesting that 4herad concentrations are diluted with the young flow components and in the western part of the aquifer where semi confining layers are not present degassing of 4herad could occur groundwater with ages in the range of 100 up to 1000 years is likely a mixture between fractions of old and young groundwater derived by the combination of the local and intermediate flow systems the limitations of the currently used age tracers suggest that additional tracers e g 39ar with a half life of 269 years may be useful to close the age gap between 3h 3he and 14c apparent age estimates in combination with 4he age model estimates this would allow us to identify the potential flow fractions converging and mixing near the centre of the aquifer and to further constrain the groundwater age distribution based on the findings of this work we demonstrated the applicability of age tracers to validate the applicability of a numerical model of groundwater flow for the evaluation of groundwater flow systems and their conjoint used to advance the conceptualization of the aquifer dynamics furthermore being able to incorporate diverse sources of information from numerical models to hydrochemistry into a joint conceptualization allows us to provide a more faithful representation of the aquifer system important in the decision making process from groundwater management supply to safety and feasibility of waste disposal systems in future work quantification of the additional sources contributing to the total 4herad determination of 4he model age and the study of additional environmental tracers e g 39ar are recommended this study serves as an example of how the use of multiple tracers i e hydrochemistry and stable and radioactive tracers together with hydrodynamic ages from particle tracking can improve the understanding of the circulation of groundwater in a lowland aquifer system at the catchment scale relevant
