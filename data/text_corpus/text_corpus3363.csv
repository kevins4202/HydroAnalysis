16815,predicting water contamination by statistical models is a useful tool to manage health risk in recreational beaches extreme contamination events i e those exceeding normative are generally rare with respect to bathing conditions and thus the data is said to be imbalanced modeling and predicting those rare events present unique challenges here we introduce and evaluate several machine learning techniques and metrics to model imbalanced data and evaluate model performance we do so by using a simulated data sets and b a real data base with records of faecal coliform abundance monitored for 10 years in 21 recreational beaches in uruguay n 19000 using in situ and meteorological variables we discuss advantages and disadvantages of the methods and provide a simple guide to perform models for a general audience we also provide r codes to reproduce model fitting and testing we found that most machine learning techniques are sensitive to imbalance and require specific data pre treatment e g upsampling to improve performance accuracy i e correctly classified cases over total cases is not adequate to evaluate model performance on imbalanced data set instead true positive rates tpr and false positive rates fpr are recommended among the 52 possible candidate algorithms tested the stratified random forest presented the better performance improving tpr in 50 with respect to baseline 0 4 and outperformed baseline in the evaluated metrics support vector machines combined with upsampling method or synthetic minority oversampling technique smote performed well similar to adaboost with smote these results suggests that combining modeling strategies is necessary to improve our capacity to anticipate water contamination and avoid health risk keywords machine learning faecal coliform recreational waters prediction 1 introduction human activities generates multiple pressures on aquatic ecosystems generally degrading its water quality major problems in coastal waters include oil spills harmful algal blooms and contamination with sewage these problems impact ecosystem and human health directly while the goal is to apply an integrated coastal zone management to reduce the ultimate generating factors avoid human contact with contaminated waters is necessary an overview of the algorithms and models applied to assess and predict quality of natural surface waters with recreational purposes shows that multivariate linear regression is the most widely applied technique de brauwere et al 2014 herrig et al 2015 olyphant and whitman 2004 thoe et al 2012 despite its scarce use in this specific problem machine learning ml methods have become very popular in the last two decades since they do not asume predefined model strucutre and can provide accurate predictions for example random forest jones et al 2013 parkhurst et al 2005 artificial neural networks choi and seo 2018 he and he 2008 kashefipour et al 2005 bayesian networks avila et al 2018 and wavelet analysis ge and frick 2009 zhang et al 2018 were successfully applied to model water quality metalearning models such as stacking and consensus methods where the outputs of individual ml models are taken as input for another model that produces the final prediction are beginning to be applied in the field bourel et al 2017 wang et al 2021 advances in soft computing techniques has widespread the use of artificial neural network and support vector machine in the field of environmental engineering haghiabi et al 2018b and water quality studies haghiabi 2016 in summary there is a growing body of works analyzing the performance of machine learning methods in a broad variety of environmental problems further examples can be found in choubin et al 2019a sajedi hosseini et al 2018 while contamination of coastal zone is increasing events with a high health risk are relatively rare predicting rare or infrequent events requires the use of appropriate statistical techniques able to deal with this type of data structures generally referred to as imbalanced data sets contamination by faeces of bathing waters generate problems to human health the management of beach quality is based on determining the health risk level based on exceeding a threshold as safe or unsafe based on the amount of faecal indicator bacteria fib those categories are based in international standards determined by world health organization or country level regulations who 2018 and requires laboratory work to determine the presence and or the number of fib determination of the number of fib in a water sample requires between 18 to 24 hours of cultivation in controlled conditions in order to count and estimate the concentration of fib the time lag between water sampling and laboratory results precludes an on time information on the risk level in a given beach in this context there is a growing interest in the development of predictive models to forecast water quality levels based on easy to measure covariates who 2018 the category with a greater health risk is represented in a minor fraction of the total registered cases for example the number of days were fib exceeds a given sanitary threshold is expected to be low in a healthy beach with respect to the number of days open for water sports and recreation however the accurate prediction of the minority days in which the swimmers should not get contact with water is critical to ensure public health safety additionally the imbalanced nature of the data structure requires specific algorithms objective functions and re sampling strategies for the generation and evaluation of models therefore specific techniques for model construction and evaluation are required those techniques include dealing with positive weighting of the minority class or the manipulation of data sets to balance the ratio of classes by replicating cases from the rare class i e upsampling randomly remove cases for the majority class i e downsampling or the synthetic generation of cases in the rare class i e smote most articles on recreational water quality prediction models are judged in terms of overall accuracy and do not explicitly recognize the imbalanced sample issue leading to bias and weakening the models predictions and their application for beach management decisions others predict abundance of fib in water and then classify the value into open or closed beach according to a regulatory criterion and varied the percentage of exceedings to maximize model performance in capturing more beach postings brooks et al 2016 searcy et al 2018 thoe et al 2015 the problem of imbalanced water quality datasets is starting to be explicitly considered some studies applied ada synthetic sampling xu et al 2020 or k mean clustering techniques to improve the training part of the algorithm for umbalanced data choi and seo 2018 this paper introduces in a easy way some statistical tools to be used by water quality modelers the appropriate evaluation and use of these techniques could help to improve predictability of water quality highly non linear relationships and different types of correlations among predictors makes some of the classical e g multiple linear regression methods not useful ml techniques provide a good way to approach these problems in many contexts better than classical methods because they assume very few or non hypothesis can handle highly non linear responses and have shown good performance for predicting water quality data while most of the ml methods have been developed more than 20 years ago their application by environmental managers or during environmental monitoring and managing have been precluded by the difficulty of translating the mathematical problem into a user friendly framework the objective of the present work is two fold i to introduce several ml techniques useful to model imbalanced data sets in a user friendly way available to a general environmental modeling audience and ii generate a model for prediction of water quality in 21 beaches monitored for 10 years in a large estuary rio de la plata we will formally introduce several techniques to deal with imbalanced data show their use and perform model construction and evaluation in simulated data sets we also demonstrate its applicability to a real data set with the goal of predicting beach quality based on fib in situ measured environmental meteorological and oceanographic variables 1 1 the r code to reproduce our results is located in this github repository available from https github com media cure imbalanced faecal contamination a code for the fitting and evaluation of models written in the open source r software is provided as supplementary material 2 methods 2 1 the problem of learning under imbalance in classes in this and the following sections we will briefly introduce the problem of learning imbalanced data and the framework theory of the performance measure and the cost sensitive learning for an imbalanced binary classifier with the aim to explain notation the study case in beaches from the capital city in uruguay south america will help to fix theoretical concepts according to uruguayan guidelines the recreational water quality criteria is surpassed when a point measure value exceeds 2000 cfu 100ml 2 2 decree 253 79 executive branch uruguay poder ejecutivo de uruguay decreto 253 79 normas para prevenir la contaminacin ambiental mediante el control de la contaminacin de aguas in spanish available from http www mvotma gub uy ciudadania item 10003601 decreto 253 079 html published 1979 accessed june 16 2021 this event is classified as positive p and swimming is not allowed if the point measurement value is lower or equal to 2000 cfu 100ml the event is classified as negative n and swimming is allowed this represents a binary classification problem imbalance on class frequency is because the number of days a beach is p is much lower than the number of days having n however from a sanitary perspective predicting p is much more important than predicting n this generates a series of drawbacks since the low number of cases makes it difficult to find a clear relationship of p with the chosen covariates e g temperature salinity etc the obtention of p cases requires a large database which include a large number of n cases in general most algorithms will tend to learn better from the majority class n while ignoring the minority one p we will introduce and evaluate a group of techniques to classify binary response data and a set of strategies to deal with such imbalanced problem 2 2 classifiers we suppose that we are working with a dataset where each observation has the form x y where x x 1 x p is a vector of predictor variables named input vector x x r p and y is the output which is the response variable and it is categorical more precisely each coordinate of x represent the value taken by a real random multivariate variable x where each component is a real random variable in our real data coordinates of x may be temperature salinity wind intensity etc the output y is the value taken by another real random variable y which takes value in y 1 k where 1 k denote the distinct possible classes in our real data y is binary and take two possible values swimming not allowed p or swimming allowed n statistically speaking the problem consists in finding from the dataset a predictor or a classifier f x y to predict the value f x new y new y of a new observation x new x in the present paper we evaluate six possible of such functions in a way to have a trade off between a good modelling of the problem and a good generalization prediction performance on new data the selected function cannot overfit the data used to build it a natural and very simple classification rule is to assign to an observation x the class computed by the classifier that maximizes the posterior probability that this observation belongs to class k indeed we have 2 possible classes and we should look at the following probabilities p 1 x p y p x x and p 2 x p y n x x then we select the class with highest probability e g p 1 x given x and assign to the observation this class formally this classifier is defined as f x argmax k 1 2 p k x and is known as the bayes classifier with the desired property of minimizing the probability of being wrong devroye et al 1997 for empirical data it is impossible to compute the bayes classifier because the true distribution of the vector x y is unknown so the objective of model construction is to obtain an estimator to approach this classifier given the available data we refer the interested reader to the specialized literature for further details devroye et al 1997 hastie et al 2001 james et al 2013 vapnik 1995 2 3 confusion matrix the classifier i e the built model will provide for each vector x of inputs an estimation of posterior probability of a given class which defined class k if its value is above a certain probability threshold or cutoff t defined by the user e g t 0 5 to decide the class of the predicted object x in our real problem this means that given some particular beach conditions measured by the values taken by covariates wind temperature etc the model provides a specific probability in 0 1 that is compared to a predefined threshold t for example t 0 5 to predict a class e g if posterior probability p 1 x is higher than 0 5 then beach is closed those model predictions are amenable to be compared with the real observed class after laboratory cultivation given a model classifier output and a given observed real class there are four possible outcomes 1 if the instance is positive and the classifier assigns the positive class it is counted as true positive tp 2 if the classifier assign the negative class it is counted as false negative fn which is equivalent to the type ii error 3 if the instance is negative and the classifier assign the positive class it is counted as false positive fp which is equivalent to the type i error 4 if the classifier assign the negative class it is counted as true negative tn this possibilities are organized in a confusion matrix see fig 1 in table b we consider the observed contamination real of ten beaches with their codification in p and n and given environmental characteristics the probability of a model for the contamination and the classification output for these beaches according to the threshold used we show in c and d two confusion matrices of the classifier using two alternative thresholds t 0 5 and t 0 1 the sum of the elements of the first column is the number of positive instances p and the sum of the elements of the second column is the number of negative instances n the sum of the principal diagonal is the number of instances well classified and the sum of the other diagonal is the global error of the classifier other metrics associated to the confusion matrix better suited for imbalanced data sets are described in the next subsection 2 4 performance metrics for imbalanced problems the global classification accuracy acc is often not a good indicator of a classifier s performance particularly in problems with imbalanced data and differences in the cost of a misclassification among classes the following example is instructive to understand the problem let s suppose now that a given model for predicting p and n has an accuracy of 0 95 we would think that the model has a very good performance however one possibility with this accuracy value is that the model predicts correctly all n cases and incorrectly all p cases p cases represent the 5 of the data which are the most relevant cases un this example there are other metrics for the evaluation of model accuracy to overcome this type of problems chen et al 2004 the true positive rate tpr or sensitivity is the rate of true positives tp over the positives p this rate t p r t p p focus its attention on the p class fib exceedance beach closed and then swimming not allowed which is the most important one in terms of sanitary risks another metric is the false positive rate fpr defined as one minus the rate of true negatives tn over negatives n i e f p r 1 t n n fig 1 the true negative rate t n r t n n 1 f p r is also called the specificity in the example above if tpr is zero that would indicate that the model failed completely to predict class p while if fpr is zero that means that the model made perfect prediction over class n both metrics are combined in the receiver operating characteristics roc curve which is a graph in which we plot the fpr x axis versus the tpr y axis of a classifier varying the threshold t of the decision of the classifier fawcett 2008 for each value of the threshold t we can consider a confusion matrix provided by the classifier and hence a unique point f p r t p r in the roc space the point 0 1 represents perfect classification there are not wrong classified instances the point 0 0 corresponds to the classifier which classify all instances as negative the point 1 1 corresponds to the classifier which assign the positive class to all the instances a point a in the roc space is in a certain sense better than another b if its tpr is higher and its fpr is lower than those of b see fawcett 2008 the diagonal y x corresponds to a classifier that has the same performance as chance this classifier provides no information if a point is under the diagonal it is associated with a classifier which is worse than random guessing this is not really a problem considering the opposite of this type of classifier we obtain a new one which implies a point in the upper side of the diagonal varying the threshold we obtain several confusion matrices and new points in the roc space the roc curve is obtained linking together all the points of the considered thresholds we consider it can be thought of as representing the family of the best decision boundaries for the relative cost of tpr and fpr for t 0 all beaches will be closed and for t 1 all will be open the roc curve summarizes the two sensitivity and specificity concept considering specificity and sensitivity as function of a given threshold t roc curve results from representing the points 1 specificity t sensitivity t 0 t 1 that is 1 specificity on the ox axis and sensitivity on the oy axis a curve far away from the diagonal and with points near of the point of perfect classification 0 1 implies a good discrimination of the classifier however it ignores the predicted probability values and the goodness of fit of the model it summarizes the test performance over regions of the roc space in which one would rarely operate it weights omission and commission errors equally to compare classifiers a useful method consists on calculating the area under the roc curve auc and compare the average performance of each model the auc has the advantage to be independent of the decision criterion selected and the prior probabilities a classifier should have an auc greater than 0 5 because this number is the area of the lowest triangle in the unit square 2 5 algorithms ml methods can be viewed as multivariate approaches with some or no conditions over the data in case they exist these conditions can be on the distribution of the data the number of observations the number of variables the nature of the variables continuous or categorical or more recently over their topology the different classifiers described below have a quite broad use nowadays in different applications in several fields in social human exact and natural sciences because of the emergency of more complex restrictive and detailed databases for the latest domain we can cite works in biology libbrecht and noble 2015 sternberg et al 1994 tarca et al 2007 in ecology bourel and segura 2018 crisci et al 2012 de ath and fabricius 2000 de la escalera et al 2017 kruk et al 2017 segura et al 2017 in water quality cruz et al 2021 feio et al 2020 haghiabi et al 2018a mosavi et al 2021 parsaie and haghiabi 2017 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 and in geology choubin et al 2018 2019b in this subsection we will briefly describe the machine learning techniques considered in this work for further reading we refer to bourel and segura 2018 moreover we present some procedures to deal with imbalanced data 1 classifiers a linear discriminant analysis lda lda fisher 1936 looks for the edge that maximize the separation between the two different groups of observations this fact implies that we can separate the data giving a spatial partition minimizing the variability within the groups and maximizing the variability between them james et al 2013 there are two strong assumptions for applying and interpreting lda namely the equality of the covariance matrices of the different classes and the multinormality of the data when these assumptions are met posterior probabilities of class pertenence can be calculated and the method is related to the mahalanobis distance further details can be found elsewhere hastie et al 2001 james et al 2013 peña 2002 b support vector machines svm as one of the main modern methods of statistical learning svm does not make assumptions on the data distribution the purpose is the same as lda to find hyperplanes in 2 dimensions an hyperplane is a line which separate different groups of observations however in the case of svm the construction of such hyperplane is different it is done maximizing the margin of separation of the data of the two groups and instead of lda it is not required to have any of the restrictions listed above even if the data are not completely linearly separated or if it is actually impossible to find a hyperplane that separates them svm can map the observations in a space of higher dimension where it is possible to separate them more linearly this fact is based on the intuitive idea that it is easier to do a separation in a larger space james et al 2013 vapnik 1995 however it is clear that svm is not a linear method in the original space of the data the idea of mapping observations in a larger space and finding a quasi linear discriminant allows to consider this algorithm as a linear procedure c logistic regression lr lr is a generalized linear model glm that includes error distributions other than gaussian and can handle categorical response variables the general form of lr is ln p 1 p β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β d x d β 0 i 1 d β i x i where β 0 β 1 β d are the regression coefficients x 1 x d the d real variables involved in the problem and p p x is the posterior probability for x to belong to class 1 defined with respect to a probability threshold u 0 1 generally t 0 5 if p x t we assign x to class p therefore to class n this method can not handle co linear co variates that must be removed from the covariate list the variance inflation factor vif allows to detect collinearity while the rule of thumb is to remove variables with vif larger than 5 then variable selection in glm can be performed using the akaike information criterion akaike 1981 d classification and regression trees cart this method was one of the first non parametric prediction methods breiman et al 1984 it is very simple to interpret and has shown good performance over several examples breiman et al 1984 de ath and fabricius 2000 the algorithm starts with all the data at the root of the tree up and does recursive binary partition to find the best split of the data via a binary rule selecting the best input variables among all and the best threshold that make greater the improve of homogeneity from father to child nodes the homogeneity is measured in terms of the purity of the data evaluated in the output variable y in our case of study for a classification tree when y is categorical the gini index is usually used g k 1 k p m k 1 p m k where p m k is the proportion of training observations with label k in the m th node recursive partitions are done several times and stop when a stopping criterion is satisfied previously fixed by the user it can be a minimum of observations at each leaf terminal node or declaring that a node is sufficiently pure if the homogeneity is greater than a fixed number the assignation of a class to each leaf terminal node is done as following the label of the terminal node is the majority class that is the class with higher number of cases on the leaf as there is a great risk of overfitting with consequent loss of generalization a cost complexity criterion which penalizes the growing of the tree is implemented this procedure is known as pruning for a gentle introduction to ecological applications we refer to de ath and fabricius 2000 cart has several advantages the final model is very simple to understand and the method provides a way to obtain the importance of the different variables that are involved in the splits one major drawback of cart is its instability i e a small change in the learning sample implies a big change in tree structure and prediction outcome to overcome this instability a group of methods termed ensemble methods or aggregating methods as bagging or boosting methods have been developed e adaboost boosting techniques were first introduced for binary classification problems freund and schapire 1997 schapire and freund 1998 with the aim of improving the performance of an unstable classifier these models are constructed on different versions of the original learning data in a sequential way at each iteration the algorithm computes a classifier f calculates the error estimation on the data and reweights the sample as follows data incorrectly classified by f increase its weight and data well classified by f decrease its weight the final classifier is an average of the intermediate classifiers weighted using a coefficient proportional to the performance of the respective classifiers f random forest rf the rf breiman 2001 is a kind of homogeneous bagging technique that combines classification trees using two layers of randomness for constructing each tree of the forest the algorithm begins randomly choosing a sample of the original learning data with reposition bootstrap sample then a tree is grown as in cart with a main difference at each split of a node the method selects a random subsample of size m of the predictor variables m square root of total number of explanatory variables another change with respect to cart is that there is no pruning of the trees the maximal tree is grown according to the stopping criterion fixed by the user at the beginning to construct the forest several trees with these characteristics are performed the aggregation is done by the majority vote of the predictions of all the trees of the forest that is the selected class of a given observation is the one with most votes for all the trees another contribution of rf is that it provides a way to calculate the importance of the variables vi in the construction of the predictor in our simulations and experiments we will apply random forest with two variants to deal with the imbalanced problem predictions are usually made with the maximum a posteriori rule that is we predict the value of y by the class k mode that maximizes the posterior probability in the presence of two classes we might think that if the probability of being in a class is greater than 1 2 then that must be the class assigned to x but this choice of 1 2 is totally arbitrary one could define the assignment rule with threshold or cutoff t as y t 1 if p y 1 x x t 0 if not we will refer to rfcutoff to the rf method using a cutoff different of 0 5 another way to deal with imbalanced data is to use a stratified sample at each bootstrap data set used for the different trees of the forest when we use this functionality of the rf function we call the method rfstrat doing this the sample used for constructing each tree is representative of the population and the proportion of cases of each category is closer to the true population for more details about the different methods we refer to breiman 2001 or cutler et al 2007 2 sampling methods are strategies used principally when there is no possibilities to assign a differential cost to one of the classes they can be grouped according to the way in which the training sample is selected a down sampling it consists of equaling the classes of the response variable removing cases of the majority label randomly empirically it has been found that the method can be effective however it has the drawback that it can discard important information since it does not include all the observations of the majority class kuhn and johnson 2013 b oversampling this method consists of increasing the size of the group of observations of the minority class by randomly selecting cases to be replicated this technique has the disadvantage of making exact copies which can generate an over adjustment within the training sample kuhn and johnson 2013 c synthetic minority over sampling technique smote in chawla et al 2002 the authors propose this method which combines oversampling in minority classes and down sampling for the majority to avoid the exact replication of cases the authors propose randomly selecting cases of the minority group and its closest neighbors generating new observations constructed from the interpolation of the explanatory variables of the selected cases and their k neighbors originally smote method was proposed for continuous variables however it can be adapted to cases where we deal with some explanatory categorical variables smote nc for more details about this method we refer the interested reader to the work of chawla et al 2002 with the corresponding pseudocodes in figure 2 and 3 we give an example of each of the sampling techniques on the simulated data of next subsection from the original sample of a binary problem in fig 2 we consider a downsampling and an upsampling fig 3 and smote technique fig 2 2 6 simulated data two simulated data sets consisted in a response variable y with two categories a and b and four continuous explanatory variables x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 in both sets the first two variables x 1 and x 2 are informative and define the response class label while x 3 and x 4 has no classification power the main difference between the two data sets is that the first one was created as to classify the response variable using linear functions of the explanatory variables l set and the second one using non linear combination of the explanatory variables n l set let x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 be a real random vector whose components x j j 1 2 3 4 follow an uniform distribution on 0 1 the classes were assigned according to the following rules 1 for the linear set l if x 1 x 2 then class y b if x 1 x 2 1 then class y a 2 for the non linear set n l if x 1 0 5 and x 2 0 5 then class y a otherwise then class y b for each case we simulated 200 observations as described above with 10 of the observations of class a minority class and the remaining 90 of class b we consider four contexts the first modeling the observations as they were simulated the second we applied downsampling to the majority class the third by upsampling the minority class and the fourth using the smote algorithm each method was trained with 2 3 of the observations and tested using the remaining 1 3 of the observations to avoid bias in the division we randomly repeat it 100 times and average the results 2 7 real data the dataset was obtained from the beach monitoring program of the department of montevideo uruguay and it contains the fecal coliform cfu 100ml which indicates the fib cyanobacteria foam presence temperature salinity and turbidity of water and geographical positions latitude and longitude of 21 beaches along the río de la plata estuary coast the frequency of the observations was 4 times a week from mid november to march and just weekly the rest of the year the higher frequency time span corresponded to the most common outdoor recreation period at beaches in uruguay daily meteorological data air temperature air humidity precipitation atmospheric pressure heliophany wind direction wind speed and clouds coverage was added from synops bufr messages from the national weather service of uruguay inumet and from an automatic weather station aws that belongs to the national agricultural research institute of uruguay inia climate indexes such as the oceanic oscillation index enso phase southern oscillation index and north pacific gyre oscillation from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa were added using the r package rsoi albers 2020 until 12 days of accumulated precipitation and 1 to 3 fib lagged computations were also added to the dataset the minority to majority ratio for the dataset was 1 11 to build and evaluate the models a data partitioning strategy was used in which the algorithms were trained with no missing values using the data from february 2011 until december 2017 9947 observations and the predictive capacity was evaluated with the data from december 2017 to march 2019 2653 observations this partition in learning set and test set allows evaluating real predictions and includes a large number of cases for training and evaluation so it does not lead to biases created by it in this way the adequacy of the models will be honestly evaluated james et al 2013 preliminary results of this work has been communicated through segura et al in press 3 results all programs used in the simulations were written in r r core team 2021 using packages mass for lda venables and ripley 2002 package mnlogit for lr hasan et al 2016 package e1071 for svm meyer et al 2017 package randomforest for rf liaw and wiener 2002 package rpart for cart therneau and atkinson 2019 package dmwr to implement resampling methods downsampling upsampling and smote torgo 2011 and package proc for the roc curve robin et al 2011 the intermediate trees constructed in adaboost were fitted with cart where weighted resampling is used instead of reweighting as the implemented version of cart in r does not handle weights at each iteration the size of the trees was optimal over a test sample which is a second bootstrap sample drawn at the same iteration using the current weights predictor variables in lr were selected using the aic criteria akaike 1981 with the stepaic function for svm we use a radial kernel for the aggregating methods adaboost and rf we use 300 and 1000 intermediate trees respectively for the rf cutoff we use t 0 1 as threshold 10 of positive cases 3 1 simulated data the evaluation of the algorithms is presented in table 1 and 2 with the four metrics and the four methods of resampling for the linear and non linear simulated data discussion about these results must take into account the three dimensions of our study the type of data linear l or non linear nl the type of statistical method linear or non linear and the resampling method used to balance the two classes downsampling upsampling and smote in the linear case l in the simple case without any change on the data set as it was expected linear methods have the best accuracy no resampling method improve the general accuracy of lr 0 97 0 02 however they improve the tpr of all the linear classifiers in particular it increases from 0 7767 0 15 to 0 9245 0 08 for lda but they do not reduce the fpr in the case of the non linear methods resampling methods do not improve the performance of rf in the simple case 0 9579 0 02 this method has also the best fpr 0 0032 0 01 in the simplest case and with the resampling procedure a general accuracy better or very competitive with the linear methods including a best score with smote and an improvement of the tpr the resampling method improved the auc index in the non linear case nl in the simple case non linear methods performed better with rf methods showing the best accuracy 0 972 0 01 followed by methods using a resampling strategy however the tpr increases but not the fpr and the performance of these metrics for the linear methods were better as it was expected visualizing variable importance in rf as measured by decrease in the gini index showed that in both l and nl data set x 1 and x 2 were the most important covariates as a general point all methods may have an excellent accuracy but the performance on the target class can be poor in general all methods that used resampling procedures improve the tpr but not the fpr and in most of the cases improved auc metric 3 2 real data results were computed and presented over the test set baseline classification is based on declaring a beach closed 24hs after precipitation this baseline gives an accuracy of 0 82 a true positive rate of 0 4 and a true negative rate of 0 85 model performance was compared to this baseline according to this criteria only three from the 52 models outperformed baseline in all metrics appendix a random forest with stratified sampling and no manipulation of data two support vector machine algorithms on data which were previously upsampled and were subjected to smote techniques table 3 the first method using the original data and the remaining two with data transformed by upsampling the first and smote the second table 3 the stratified random forest model showed superior performance improving on its direct competitors on all metrics and on the baseline table 3 however if its tnr is a few lower for the other metrics adaboost using smote technique is very competitive and has a tpr a little better than rfst without resampling we also give the variable importance plot computed by random forest fig 4 the method gives a measure of the contribution of each variable to the homogeneity of the child nodes using gini index breiman 2001 cutler et al 2007 this allows to rank variables according to importance to the trees but does not provide information on the sign of the variables as they are embedded in a complex forest 4 discussion the world health organization suggested the use of ml models to predict water quality and anticipate health risk events searcy et al 2018 thoe et al 2015 however specific recommendations on how to deal with imbalanced data remain scarce in this article we presented an introduction to machine learning methods to deal with imbalanced classification problems while there is a growing interest in the imbalanced classification problem xu et al 2020 the technical nature of the literature has precluded a widespread use and evaluation of this methods haibo he and garcia 2009 here we evaluated the performance of several methods in simulated and a real water quality problem and showed advantages and disadvantages of each of the methods and performance metrics while there is not a best algorithm for every problem and data set we provide some specific suggestions on how to evaluate and select a given model for specific problems random forest with stratified sampling from the two classes was able to predict excess of faecal coliforms with an appropiate accuracy while keeping a high auc tpr and a low fpr 1 tnr in this case the model seems to perform a good job in predicting beach water quality comparing this result with logistic regression is illustrative to show why it is necessary to compare a set of performance metrics indeed using logistic regression we obtain an excellent accuracy acc 0 92 and a perfect false positive rate fpr 0 but with no predictive ability for the exceeding class tpr 0 which renders this model not useful to predict sanitary risks close to the performance of stratified random forest there were two versions of support vector machine technique svm both required artificial increase of the minority class to get an appropriate classification ranking improving with respect to baseline and close to the stratified random forest rfst the use of accuracy as a performance metric should be discarded when modeling imbalanced data sets because could lead to wrong model selection most ml algorithms are greedy and rapidly try to predict majority class overlooking the remaining classes however when it is relevant to accurately predict the minority class metrics such as true positive rates should be employed stratified random forest resolves the imbalance by taking a balanced bootstrap subsample for constructing each single tree thus increasing the exploration of the majority class space downsampling technique loss much of the information in the majority class by subsampling a defined proportion of the cases on the contrary upsampling allows to train the model in the whole variate space of the majority class does not add new information on the minority class in between smote generates new samples of the minority class by using some predefined distance criteria when the classes are well separated in the covariate space this is relatively efficient but sometimes the generation of artificial data is not straightforward and could create spurious results xu et al 2020 in the analysis of real data ml models improved classification metrics with respect to the baseline criteria used for classification of beaches as p or n from the 72 tested models only 3 outperformed baseline in all the evaluated metrics baseline defined positive contamination when precipitations was registered in the past 24 hs the sewage and pluvial network are interconnected in montevideo generating excess in the beaches after rainfall the model most important variables were related to the identity of the beach previous kind of contamination and a series of in situ measured variables salinity temperature this is expected since they capture the local beach and basin dynamics most of the articles does not explicitly recognise the problem of imbalanced data sets others predict concentration of fib in water and then classify into open or closed beach according to regulatory criteria avila et al 2018 while recently the problem of class imbalance is starting to be considered brooks et al 2016 we hope this paper help to incorporate appropriate statistical tools into the water quality modelers toolbox 5 conclusion the combination of ml models with beach monitoring is critical to generate data bases on which to train the algorithms taking in account the problem of class imbalance is crucial in this context and it is necessary to consider other metrics than the accuracy of the method used including rapid methods for detection of faecal contamination such as molecular tools can help to provide early warnings to avoid human contact with contaminated water bodies however working on land use planning and waste water treatment before the arrival of contamination to the water bodies is crucial in order to decrease contamination in recreational beaches novel deep learning approaches suffer from the same problems of classical machine learning approaches thus the exploration of novel

16815,predicting water contamination by statistical models is a useful tool to manage health risk in recreational beaches extreme contamination events i e those exceeding normative are generally rare with respect to bathing conditions and thus the data is said to be imbalanced modeling and predicting those rare events present unique challenges here we introduce and evaluate several machine learning techniques and metrics to model imbalanced data and evaluate model performance we do so by using a simulated data sets and b a real data base with records of faecal coliform abundance monitored for 10 years in 21 recreational beaches in uruguay n 19000 using in situ and meteorological variables we discuss advantages and disadvantages of the methods and provide a simple guide to perform models for a general audience we also provide r codes to reproduce model fitting and testing we found that most machine learning techniques are sensitive to imbalance and require specific data pre treatment e g upsampling to improve performance accuracy i e correctly classified cases over total cases is not adequate to evaluate model performance on imbalanced data set instead true positive rates tpr and false positive rates fpr are recommended among the 52 possible candidate algorithms tested the stratified random forest presented the better performance improving tpr in 50 with respect to baseline 0 4 and outperformed baseline in the evaluated metrics support vector machines combined with upsampling method or synthetic minority oversampling technique smote performed well similar to adaboost with smote these results suggests that combining modeling strategies is necessary to improve our capacity to anticipate water contamination and avoid health risk keywords machine learning faecal coliform recreational waters prediction 1 introduction human activities generates multiple pressures on aquatic ecosystems generally degrading its water quality major problems in coastal waters include oil spills harmful algal blooms and contamination with sewage these problems impact ecosystem and human health directly while the goal is to apply an integrated coastal zone management to reduce the ultimate generating factors avoid human contact with contaminated waters is necessary an overview of the algorithms and models applied to assess and predict quality of natural surface waters with recreational purposes shows that multivariate linear regression is the most widely applied technique de brauwere et al 2014 herrig et al 2015 olyphant and whitman 2004 thoe et al 2012 despite its scarce use in this specific problem machine learning ml methods have become very popular in the last two decades since they do not asume predefined model strucutre and can provide accurate predictions for example random forest jones et al 2013 parkhurst et al 2005 artificial neural networks choi and seo 2018 he and he 2008 kashefipour et al 2005 bayesian networks avila et al 2018 and wavelet analysis ge and frick 2009 zhang et al 2018 were successfully applied to model water quality metalearning models such as stacking and consensus methods where the outputs of individual ml models are taken as input for another model that produces the final prediction are beginning to be applied in the field bourel et al 2017 wang et al 2021 advances in soft computing techniques has widespread the use of artificial neural network and support vector machine in the field of environmental engineering haghiabi et al 2018b and water quality studies haghiabi 2016 in summary there is a growing body of works analyzing the performance of machine learning methods in a broad variety of environmental problems further examples can be found in choubin et al 2019a sajedi hosseini et al 2018 while contamination of coastal zone is increasing events with a high health risk are relatively rare predicting rare or infrequent events requires the use of appropriate statistical techniques able to deal with this type of data structures generally referred to as imbalanced data sets contamination by faeces of bathing waters generate problems to human health the management of beach quality is based on determining the health risk level based on exceeding a threshold as safe or unsafe based on the amount of faecal indicator bacteria fib those categories are based in international standards determined by world health organization or country level regulations who 2018 and requires laboratory work to determine the presence and or the number of fib determination of the number of fib in a water sample requires between 18 to 24 hours of cultivation in controlled conditions in order to count and estimate the concentration of fib the time lag between water sampling and laboratory results precludes an on time information on the risk level in a given beach in this context there is a growing interest in the development of predictive models to forecast water quality levels based on easy to measure covariates who 2018 the category with a greater health risk is represented in a minor fraction of the total registered cases for example the number of days were fib exceeds a given sanitary threshold is expected to be low in a healthy beach with respect to the number of days open for water sports and recreation however the accurate prediction of the minority days in which the swimmers should not get contact with water is critical to ensure public health safety additionally the imbalanced nature of the data structure requires specific algorithms objective functions and re sampling strategies for the generation and evaluation of models therefore specific techniques for model construction and evaluation are required those techniques include dealing with positive weighting of the minority class or the manipulation of data sets to balance the ratio of classes by replicating cases from the rare class i e upsampling randomly remove cases for the majority class i e downsampling or the synthetic generation of cases in the rare class i e smote most articles on recreational water quality prediction models are judged in terms of overall accuracy and do not explicitly recognize the imbalanced sample issue leading to bias and weakening the models predictions and their application for beach management decisions others predict abundance of fib in water and then classify the value into open or closed beach according to a regulatory criterion and varied the percentage of exceedings to maximize model performance in capturing more beach postings brooks et al 2016 searcy et al 2018 thoe et al 2015 the problem of imbalanced water quality datasets is starting to be explicitly considered some studies applied ada synthetic sampling xu et al 2020 or k mean clustering techniques to improve the training part of the algorithm for umbalanced data choi and seo 2018 this paper introduces in a easy way some statistical tools to be used by water quality modelers the appropriate evaluation and use of these techniques could help to improve predictability of water quality highly non linear relationships and different types of correlations among predictors makes some of the classical e g multiple linear regression methods not useful ml techniques provide a good way to approach these problems in many contexts better than classical methods because they assume very few or non hypothesis can handle highly non linear responses and have shown good performance for predicting water quality data while most of the ml methods have been developed more than 20 years ago their application by environmental managers or during environmental monitoring and managing have been precluded by the difficulty of translating the mathematical problem into a user friendly framework the objective of the present work is two fold i to introduce several ml techniques useful to model imbalanced data sets in a user friendly way available to a general environmental modeling audience and ii generate a model for prediction of water quality in 21 beaches monitored for 10 years in a large estuary rio de la plata we will formally introduce several techniques to deal with imbalanced data show their use and perform model construction and evaluation in simulated data sets we also demonstrate its applicability to a real data set with the goal of predicting beach quality based on fib in situ measured environmental meteorological and oceanographic variables 1 1 the r code to reproduce our results is located in this github repository available from https github com media cure imbalanced faecal contamination a code for the fitting and evaluation of models written in the open source r software is provided as supplementary material 2 methods 2 1 the problem of learning under imbalance in classes in this and the following sections we will briefly introduce the problem of learning imbalanced data and the framework theory of the performance measure and the cost sensitive learning for an imbalanced binary classifier with the aim to explain notation the study case in beaches from the capital city in uruguay south america will help to fix theoretical concepts according to uruguayan guidelines the recreational water quality criteria is surpassed when a point measure value exceeds 2000 cfu 100ml 2 2 decree 253 79 executive branch uruguay poder ejecutivo de uruguay decreto 253 79 normas para prevenir la contaminacin ambiental mediante el control de la contaminacin de aguas in spanish available from http www mvotma gub uy ciudadania item 10003601 decreto 253 079 html published 1979 accessed june 16 2021 this event is classified as positive p and swimming is not allowed if the point measurement value is lower or equal to 2000 cfu 100ml the event is classified as negative n and swimming is allowed this represents a binary classification problem imbalance on class frequency is because the number of days a beach is p is much lower than the number of days having n however from a sanitary perspective predicting p is much more important than predicting n this generates a series of drawbacks since the low number of cases makes it difficult to find a clear relationship of p with the chosen covariates e g temperature salinity etc the obtention of p cases requires a large database which include a large number of n cases in general most algorithms will tend to learn better from the majority class n while ignoring the minority one p we will introduce and evaluate a group of techniques to classify binary response data and a set of strategies to deal with such imbalanced problem 2 2 classifiers we suppose that we are working with a dataset where each observation has the form x y where x x 1 x p is a vector of predictor variables named input vector x x r p and y is the output which is the response variable and it is categorical more precisely each coordinate of x represent the value taken by a real random multivariate variable x where each component is a real random variable in our real data coordinates of x may be temperature salinity wind intensity etc the output y is the value taken by another real random variable y which takes value in y 1 k where 1 k denote the distinct possible classes in our real data y is binary and take two possible values swimming not allowed p or swimming allowed n statistically speaking the problem consists in finding from the dataset a predictor or a classifier f x y to predict the value f x new y new y of a new observation x new x in the present paper we evaluate six possible of such functions in a way to have a trade off between a good modelling of the problem and a good generalization prediction performance on new data the selected function cannot overfit the data used to build it a natural and very simple classification rule is to assign to an observation x the class computed by the classifier that maximizes the posterior probability that this observation belongs to class k indeed we have 2 possible classes and we should look at the following probabilities p 1 x p y p x x and p 2 x p y n x x then we select the class with highest probability e g p 1 x given x and assign to the observation this class formally this classifier is defined as f x argmax k 1 2 p k x and is known as the bayes classifier with the desired property of minimizing the probability of being wrong devroye et al 1997 for empirical data it is impossible to compute the bayes classifier because the true distribution of the vector x y is unknown so the objective of model construction is to obtain an estimator to approach this classifier given the available data we refer the interested reader to the specialized literature for further details devroye et al 1997 hastie et al 2001 james et al 2013 vapnik 1995 2 3 confusion matrix the classifier i e the built model will provide for each vector x of inputs an estimation of posterior probability of a given class which defined class k if its value is above a certain probability threshold or cutoff t defined by the user e g t 0 5 to decide the class of the predicted object x in our real problem this means that given some particular beach conditions measured by the values taken by covariates wind temperature etc the model provides a specific probability in 0 1 that is compared to a predefined threshold t for example t 0 5 to predict a class e g if posterior probability p 1 x is higher than 0 5 then beach is closed those model predictions are amenable to be compared with the real observed class after laboratory cultivation given a model classifier output and a given observed real class there are four possible outcomes 1 if the instance is positive and the classifier assigns the positive class it is counted as true positive tp 2 if the classifier assign the negative class it is counted as false negative fn which is equivalent to the type ii error 3 if the instance is negative and the classifier assign the positive class it is counted as false positive fp which is equivalent to the type i error 4 if the classifier assign the negative class it is counted as true negative tn this possibilities are organized in a confusion matrix see fig 1 in table b we consider the observed contamination real of ten beaches with their codification in p and n and given environmental characteristics the probability of a model for the contamination and the classification output for these beaches according to the threshold used we show in c and d two confusion matrices of the classifier using two alternative thresholds t 0 5 and t 0 1 the sum of the elements of the first column is the number of positive instances p and the sum of the elements of the second column is the number of negative instances n the sum of the principal diagonal is the number of instances well classified and the sum of the other diagonal is the global error of the classifier other metrics associated to the confusion matrix better suited for imbalanced data sets are described in the next subsection 2 4 performance metrics for imbalanced problems the global classification accuracy acc is often not a good indicator of a classifier s performance particularly in problems with imbalanced data and differences in the cost of a misclassification among classes the following example is instructive to understand the problem let s suppose now that a given model for predicting p and n has an accuracy of 0 95 we would think that the model has a very good performance however one possibility with this accuracy value is that the model predicts correctly all n cases and incorrectly all p cases p cases represent the 5 of the data which are the most relevant cases un this example there are other metrics for the evaluation of model accuracy to overcome this type of problems chen et al 2004 the true positive rate tpr or sensitivity is the rate of true positives tp over the positives p this rate t p r t p p focus its attention on the p class fib exceedance beach closed and then swimming not allowed which is the most important one in terms of sanitary risks another metric is the false positive rate fpr defined as one minus the rate of true negatives tn over negatives n i e f p r 1 t n n fig 1 the true negative rate t n r t n n 1 f p r is also called the specificity in the example above if tpr is zero that would indicate that the model failed completely to predict class p while if fpr is zero that means that the model made perfect prediction over class n both metrics are combined in the receiver operating characteristics roc curve which is a graph in which we plot the fpr x axis versus the tpr y axis of a classifier varying the threshold t of the decision of the classifier fawcett 2008 for each value of the threshold t we can consider a confusion matrix provided by the classifier and hence a unique point f p r t p r in the roc space the point 0 1 represents perfect classification there are not wrong classified instances the point 0 0 corresponds to the classifier which classify all instances as negative the point 1 1 corresponds to the classifier which assign the positive class to all the instances a point a in the roc space is in a certain sense better than another b if its tpr is higher and its fpr is lower than those of b see fawcett 2008 the diagonal y x corresponds to a classifier that has the same performance as chance this classifier provides no information if a point is under the diagonal it is associated with a classifier which is worse than random guessing this is not really a problem considering the opposite of this type of classifier we obtain a new one which implies a point in the upper side of the diagonal varying the threshold we obtain several confusion matrices and new points in the roc space the roc curve is obtained linking together all the points of the considered thresholds we consider it can be thought of as representing the family of the best decision boundaries for the relative cost of tpr and fpr for t 0 all beaches will be closed and for t 1 all will be open the roc curve summarizes the two sensitivity and specificity concept considering specificity and sensitivity as function of a given threshold t roc curve results from representing the points 1 specificity t sensitivity t 0 t 1 that is 1 specificity on the ox axis and sensitivity on the oy axis a curve far away from the diagonal and with points near of the point of perfect classification 0 1 implies a good discrimination of the classifier however it ignores the predicted probability values and the goodness of fit of the model it summarizes the test performance over regions of the roc space in which one would rarely operate it weights omission and commission errors equally to compare classifiers a useful method consists on calculating the area under the roc curve auc and compare the average performance of each model the auc has the advantage to be independent of the decision criterion selected and the prior probabilities a classifier should have an auc greater than 0 5 because this number is the area of the lowest triangle in the unit square 2 5 algorithms ml methods can be viewed as multivariate approaches with some or no conditions over the data in case they exist these conditions can be on the distribution of the data the number of observations the number of variables the nature of the variables continuous or categorical or more recently over their topology the different classifiers described below have a quite broad use nowadays in different applications in several fields in social human exact and natural sciences because of the emergency of more complex restrictive and detailed databases for the latest domain we can cite works in biology libbrecht and noble 2015 sternberg et al 1994 tarca et al 2007 in ecology bourel and segura 2018 crisci et al 2012 de ath and fabricius 2000 de la escalera et al 2017 kruk et al 2017 segura et al 2017 in water quality cruz et al 2021 feio et al 2020 haghiabi et al 2018a mosavi et al 2021 parsaie and haghiabi 2017 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 and in geology choubin et al 2018 2019b in this subsection we will briefly describe the machine learning techniques considered in this work for further reading we refer to bourel and segura 2018 moreover we present some procedures to deal with imbalanced data 1 classifiers a linear discriminant analysis lda lda fisher 1936 looks for the edge that maximize the separation between the two different groups of observations this fact implies that we can separate the data giving a spatial partition minimizing the variability within the groups and maximizing the variability between them james et al 2013 there are two strong assumptions for applying and interpreting lda namely the equality of the covariance matrices of the different classes and the multinormality of the data when these assumptions are met posterior probabilities of class pertenence can be calculated and the method is related to the mahalanobis distance further details can be found elsewhere hastie et al 2001 james et al 2013 peña 2002 b support vector machines svm as one of the main modern methods of statistical learning svm does not make assumptions on the data distribution the purpose is the same as lda to find hyperplanes in 2 dimensions an hyperplane is a line which separate different groups of observations however in the case of svm the construction of such hyperplane is different it is done maximizing the margin of separation of the data of the two groups and instead of lda it is not required to have any of the restrictions listed above even if the data are not completely linearly separated or if it is actually impossible to find a hyperplane that separates them svm can map the observations in a space of higher dimension where it is possible to separate them more linearly this fact is based on the intuitive idea that it is easier to do a separation in a larger space james et al 2013 vapnik 1995 however it is clear that svm is not a linear method in the original space of the data the idea of mapping observations in a larger space and finding a quasi linear discriminant allows to consider this algorithm as a linear procedure c logistic regression lr lr is a generalized linear model glm that includes error distributions other than gaussian and can handle categorical response variables the general form of lr is ln p 1 p β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β d x d β 0 i 1 d β i x i where β 0 β 1 β d are the regression coefficients x 1 x d the d real variables involved in the problem and p p x is the posterior probability for x to belong to class 1 defined with respect to a probability threshold u 0 1 generally t 0 5 if p x t we assign x to class p therefore to class n this method can not handle co linear co variates that must be removed from the covariate list the variance inflation factor vif allows to detect collinearity while the rule of thumb is to remove variables with vif larger than 5 then variable selection in glm can be performed using the akaike information criterion akaike 1981 d classification and regression trees cart this method was one of the first non parametric prediction methods breiman et al 1984 it is very simple to interpret and has shown good performance over several examples breiman et al 1984 de ath and fabricius 2000 the algorithm starts with all the data at the root of the tree up and does recursive binary partition to find the best split of the data via a binary rule selecting the best input variables among all and the best threshold that make greater the improve of homogeneity from father to child nodes the homogeneity is measured in terms of the purity of the data evaluated in the output variable y in our case of study for a classification tree when y is categorical the gini index is usually used g k 1 k p m k 1 p m k where p m k is the proportion of training observations with label k in the m th node recursive partitions are done several times and stop when a stopping criterion is satisfied previously fixed by the user it can be a minimum of observations at each leaf terminal node or declaring that a node is sufficiently pure if the homogeneity is greater than a fixed number the assignation of a class to each leaf terminal node is done as following the label of the terminal node is the majority class that is the class with higher number of cases on the leaf as there is a great risk of overfitting with consequent loss of generalization a cost complexity criterion which penalizes the growing of the tree is implemented this procedure is known as pruning for a gentle introduction to ecological applications we refer to de ath and fabricius 2000 cart has several advantages the final model is very simple to understand and the method provides a way to obtain the importance of the different variables that are involved in the splits one major drawback of cart is its instability i e a small change in the learning sample implies a big change in tree structure and prediction outcome to overcome this instability a group of methods termed ensemble methods or aggregating methods as bagging or boosting methods have been developed e adaboost boosting techniques were first introduced for binary classification problems freund and schapire 1997 schapire and freund 1998 with the aim of improving the performance of an unstable classifier these models are constructed on different versions of the original learning data in a sequential way at each iteration the algorithm computes a classifier f calculates the error estimation on the data and reweights the sample as follows data incorrectly classified by f increase its weight and data well classified by f decrease its weight the final classifier is an average of the intermediate classifiers weighted using a coefficient proportional to the performance of the respective classifiers f random forest rf the rf breiman 2001 is a kind of homogeneous bagging technique that combines classification trees using two layers of randomness for constructing each tree of the forest the algorithm begins randomly choosing a sample of the original learning data with reposition bootstrap sample then a tree is grown as in cart with a main difference at each split of a node the method selects a random subsample of size m of the predictor variables m square root of total number of explanatory variables another change with respect to cart is that there is no pruning of the trees the maximal tree is grown according to the stopping criterion fixed by the user at the beginning to construct the forest several trees with these characteristics are performed the aggregation is done by the majority vote of the predictions of all the trees of the forest that is the selected class of a given observation is the one with most votes for all the trees another contribution of rf is that it provides a way to calculate the importance of the variables vi in the construction of the predictor in our simulations and experiments we will apply random forest with two variants to deal with the imbalanced problem predictions are usually made with the maximum a posteriori rule that is we predict the value of y by the class k mode that maximizes the posterior probability in the presence of two classes we might think that if the probability of being in a class is greater than 1 2 then that must be the class assigned to x but this choice of 1 2 is totally arbitrary one could define the assignment rule with threshold or cutoff t as y t 1 if p y 1 x x t 0 if not we will refer to rfcutoff to the rf method using a cutoff different of 0 5 another way to deal with imbalanced data is to use a stratified sample at each bootstrap data set used for the different trees of the forest when we use this functionality of the rf function we call the method rfstrat doing this the sample used for constructing each tree is representative of the population and the proportion of cases of each category is closer to the true population for more details about the different methods we refer to breiman 2001 or cutler et al 2007 2 sampling methods are strategies used principally when there is no possibilities to assign a differential cost to one of the classes they can be grouped according to the way in which the training sample is selected a down sampling it consists of equaling the classes of the response variable removing cases of the majority label randomly empirically it has been found that the method can be effective however it has the drawback that it can discard important information since it does not include all the observations of the majority class kuhn and johnson 2013 b oversampling this method consists of increasing the size of the group of observations of the minority class by randomly selecting cases to be replicated this technique has the disadvantage of making exact copies which can generate an over adjustment within the training sample kuhn and johnson 2013 c synthetic minority over sampling technique smote in chawla et al 2002 the authors propose this method which combines oversampling in minority classes and down sampling for the majority to avoid the exact replication of cases the authors propose randomly selecting cases of the minority group and its closest neighbors generating new observations constructed from the interpolation of the explanatory variables of the selected cases and their k neighbors originally smote method was proposed for continuous variables however it can be adapted to cases where we deal with some explanatory categorical variables smote nc for more details about this method we refer the interested reader to the work of chawla et al 2002 with the corresponding pseudocodes in figure 2 and 3 we give an example of each of the sampling techniques on the simulated data of next subsection from the original sample of a binary problem in fig 2 we consider a downsampling and an upsampling fig 3 and smote technique fig 2 2 6 simulated data two simulated data sets consisted in a response variable y with two categories a and b and four continuous explanatory variables x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 in both sets the first two variables x 1 and x 2 are informative and define the response class label while x 3 and x 4 has no classification power the main difference between the two data sets is that the first one was created as to classify the response variable using linear functions of the explanatory variables l set and the second one using non linear combination of the explanatory variables n l set let x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 be a real random vector whose components x j j 1 2 3 4 follow an uniform distribution on 0 1 the classes were assigned according to the following rules 1 for the linear set l if x 1 x 2 then class y b if x 1 x 2 1 then class y a 2 for the non linear set n l if x 1 0 5 and x 2 0 5 then class y a otherwise then class y b for each case we simulated 200 observations as described above with 10 of the observations of class a minority class and the remaining 90 of class b we consider four contexts the first modeling the observations as they were simulated the second we applied downsampling to the majority class the third by upsampling the minority class and the fourth using the smote algorithm each method was trained with 2 3 of the observations and tested using the remaining 1 3 of the observations to avoid bias in the division we randomly repeat it 100 times and average the results 2 7 real data the dataset was obtained from the beach monitoring program of the department of montevideo uruguay and it contains the fecal coliform cfu 100ml which indicates the fib cyanobacteria foam presence temperature salinity and turbidity of water and geographical positions latitude and longitude of 21 beaches along the río de la plata estuary coast the frequency of the observations was 4 times a week from mid november to march and just weekly the rest of the year the higher frequency time span corresponded to the most common outdoor recreation period at beaches in uruguay daily meteorological data air temperature air humidity precipitation atmospheric pressure heliophany wind direction wind speed and clouds coverage was added from synops bufr messages from the national weather service of uruguay inumet and from an automatic weather station aws that belongs to the national agricultural research institute of uruguay inia climate indexes such as the oceanic oscillation index enso phase southern oscillation index and north pacific gyre oscillation from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa were added using the r package rsoi albers 2020 until 12 days of accumulated precipitation and 1 to 3 fib lagged computations were also added to the dataset the minority to majority ratio for the dataset was 1 11 to build and evaluate the models a data partitioning strategy was used in which the algorithms were trained with no missing values using the data from february 2011 until december 2017 9947 observations and the predictive capacity was evaluated with the data from december 2017 to march 2019 2653 observations this partition in learning set and test set allows evaluating real predictions and includes a large number of cases for training and evaluation so it does not lead to biases created by it in this way the adequacy of the models will be honestly evaluated james et al 2013 preliminary results of this work has been communicated through segura et al in press 3 results all programs used in the simulations were written in r r core team 2021 using packages mass for lda venables and ripley 2002 package mnlogit for lr hasan et al 2016 package e1071 for svm meyer et al 2017 package randomforest for rf liaw and wiener 2002 package rpart for cart therneau and atkinson 2019 package dmwr to implement resampling methods downsampling upsampling and smote torgo 2011 and package proc for the roc curve robin et al 2011 the intermediate trees constructed in adaboost were fitted with cart where weighted resampling is used instead of reweighting as the implemented version of cart in r does not handle weights at each iteration the size of the trees was optimal over a test sample which is a second bootstrap sample drawn at the same iteration using the current weights predictor variables in lr were selected using the aic criteria akaike 1981 with the stepaic function for svm we use a radial kernel for the aggregating methods adaboost and rf we use 300 and 1000 intermediate trees respectively for the rf cutoff we use t 0 1 as threshold 10 of positive cases 3 1 simulated data the evaluation of the algorithms is presented in table 1 and 2 with the four metrics and the four methods of resampling for the linear and non linear simulated data discussion about these results must take into account the three dimensions of our study the type of data linear l or non linear nl the type of statistical method linear or non linear and the resampling method used to balance the two classes downsampling upsampling and smote in the linear case l in the simple case without any change on the data set as it was expected linear methods have the best accuracy no resampling method improve the general accuracy of lr 0 97 0 02 however they improve the tpr of all the linear classifiers in particular it increases from 0 7767 0 15 to 0 9245 0 08 for lda but they do not reduce the fpr in the case of the non linear methods resampling methods do not improve the performance of rf in the simple case 0 9579 0 02 this method has also the best fpr 0 0032 0 01 in the simplest case and with the resampling procedure a general accuracy better or very competitive with the linear methods including a best score with smote and an improvement of the tpr the resampling method improved the auc index in the non linear case nl in the simple case non linear methods performed better with rf methods showing the best accuracy 0 972 0 01 followed by methods using a resampling strategy however the tpr increases but not the fpr and the performance of these metrics for the linear methods were better as it was expected visualizing variable importance in rf as measured by decrease in the gini index showed that in both l and nl data set x 1 and x 2 were the most important covariates as a general point all methods may have an excellent accuracy but the performance on the target class can be poor in general all methods that used resampling procedures improve the tpr but not the fpr and in most of the cases improved auc metric 3 2 real data results were computed and presented over the test set baseline classification is based on declaring a beach closed 24hs after precipitation this baseline gives an accuracy of 0 82 a true positive rate of 0 4 and a true negative rate of 0 85 model performance was compared to this baseline according to this criteria only three from the 52 models outperformed baseline in all metrics appendix a random forest with stratified sampling and no manipulation of data two support vector machine algorithms on data which were previously upsampled and were subjected to smote techniques table 3 the first method using the original data and the remaining two with data transformed by upsampling the first and smote the second table 3 the stratified random forest model showed superior performance improving on its direct competitors on all metrics and on the baseline table 3 however if its tnr is a few lower for the other metrics adaboost using smote technique is very competitive and has a tpr a little better than rfst without resampling we also give the variable importance plot computed by random forest fig 4 the method gives a measure of the contribution of each variable to the homogeneity of the child nodes using gini index breiman 2001 cutler et al 2007 this allows to rank variables according to importance to the trees but does not provide information on the sign of the variables as they are embedded in a complex forest 4 discussion the world health organization suggested the use of ml models to predict water quality and anticipate health risk events searcy et al 2018 thoe et al 2015 however specific recommendations on how to deal with imbalanced data remain scarce in this article we presented an introduction to machine learning methods to deal with imbalanced classification problems while there is a growing interest in the imbalanced classification problem xu et al 2020 the technical nature of the literature has precluded a widespread use and evaluation of this methods haibo he and garcia 2009 here we evaluated the performance of several methods in simulated and a real water quality problem and showed advantages and disadvantages of each of the methods and performance metrics while there is not a best algorithm for every problem and data set we provide some specific suggestions on how to evaluate and select a given model for specific problems random forest with stratified sampling from the two classes was able to predict excess of faecal coliforms with an appropiate accuracy while keeping a high auc tpr and a low fpr 1 tnr in this case the model seems to perform a good job in predicting beach water quality comparing this result with logistic regression is illustrative to show why it is necessary to compare a set of performance metrics indeed using logistic regression we obtain an excellent accuracy acc 0 92 and a perfect false positive rate fpr 0 but with no predictive ability for the exceeding class tpr 0 which renders this model not useful to predict sanitary risks close to the performance of stratified random forest there were two versions of support vector machine technique svm both required artificial increase of the minority class to get an appropriate classification ranking improving with respect to baseline and close to the stratified random forest rfst the use of accuracy as a performance metric should be discarded when modeling imbalanced data sets because could lead to wrong model selection most ml algorithms are greedy and rapidly try to predict majority class overlooking the remaining classes however when it is relevant to accurately predict the minority class metrics such as true positive rates should be employed stratified random forest resolves the imbalance by taking a balanced bootstrap subsample for constructing each single tree thus increasing the exploration of the majority class space downsampling technique loss much of the information in the majority class by subsampling a defined proportion of the cases on the contrary upsampling allows to train the model in the whole variate space of the majority class does not add new information on the minority class in between smote generates new samples of the minority class by using some predefined distance criteria when the classes are well separated in the covariate space this is relatively efficient but sometimes the generation of artificial data is not straightforward and could create spurious results xu et al 2020 in the analysis of real data ml models improved classification metrics with respect to the baseline criteria used for classification of beaches as p or n from the 72 tested models only 3 outperformed baseline in all the evaluated metrics baseline defined positive contamination when precipitations was registered in the past 24 hs the sewage and pluvial network are interconnected in montevideo generating excess in the beaches after rainfall the model most important variables were related to the identity of the beach previous kind of contamination and a series of in situ measured variables salinity temperature this is expected since they capture the local beach and basin dynamics most of the articles does not explicitly recognise the problem of imbalanced data sets others predict concentration of fib in water and then classify into open or closed beach according to regulatory criteria avila et al 2018 while recently the problem of class imbalance is starting to be considered brooks et al 2016 we hope this paper help to incorporate appropriate statistical tools into the water quality modelers toolbox 5 conclusion the combination of ml models with beach monitoring is critical to generate data bases on which to train the algorithms taking in account the problem of class imbalance is crucial in this context and it is necessary to consider other metrics than the accuracy of the method used including rapid methods for detection of faecal contamination such as molecular tools can help to provide early warnings to avoid human contact with contaminated water bodies however working on land use planning and waste water treatment before the arrival of contamination to the water bodies is crucial in order to decrease contamination in recreational beaches novel deep learning approaches suffer from the same problems of classical machine learning approaches thus the exploration of novel techniques and algorithms will be beneficial for the development of predictive models of water quality declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16816,a comprehensive dataset of pollutant concentrations in german urban wastewater systems is available from recently completed monitoring projects it contains up to 1000 concentration values for each of 79 substances in wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents from 49 sites and up to 157 values for each of 95 substances in combined sewer overflows csos from 12 sites wwtp influents and stormwater outfalls were sampled to a lesser extent all sampling methods were harmonised and aimed at collecting event or multi day composite samples over periods of 1 year among the substances analysed were biocides and pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons perfluorinated alkyl substances metals pharmaceuticals benzotriazoles phenols acesulfame di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate and hexabromocyclododecanes occurrence concentration ranges and removal rates of selected wwtps are presented csos can be confirmed as an important pathway of metals and pah to receiving waters when compared to wwtps on the basis of annual per capita loads the derived volume weighted site mean concentrations are qualified to be used as representative input data for estimation of average substance emissions in large areas e g on river basin scale if no site specific data are available as such they will contribute to the development of strategies to reduce substance emissions taking into account not only wwtps but also stormwater related discharges graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water quality priority substances micropollutants wastewater treatment plant combined sewer overflow stormwater outfall 1 introduction state of the art wastewater treatment plants wwtps are highly effective in removing suspended solids biodegradable organic matter and nutrients still wastewater discharges from urban areas are among the main pressures on surface water quality kristensen et al 2018 in addition to continuous emissions from wwtps increased attention needs to be paid to non continuous stormwater related emissions from urban wastewater systems uws these are stormwater outfalls ssos in separate sewer systems and combined sewer overflows csos in combined sewer systems ssos and csos may contribute significant shares to the total emission from uws depending on the pollutant considered fuchs and toshovski 2016 consequently a holistic assessment of the emissions from both wastewater and stormwater treatment is needed to manage surface water pollution effectively the increasing contamination of surface water bodies with micropollutants is one of the major challenges for water management schwarzenbach et al 2006 new chemicals are developed produced and brought to application at a rapid pace at the same time the uncertainties regarding ecotoxicological risks connected to the emission of these substances are high schwarzenbach et al 2006 several groups of substances show ubiquitous environmental occurrence such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah or per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances pfas only 38 of the surface water bodies in the eu are in a good chemical status according to environmental quality standards eqs kristensen et al 2018 certain persistent mobile and toxic substances might become increasingly challenging for water supplies rüdel et al 2020 while advanced treatment processes for the elimination of micropollutants e g adsorption or oxidation are being developed and implemented in wwtps eggen et al 2014 luo et al 2014 emissions from ssos and csos are so far rarely considered information on the quality of wastewater and stormwater is used for treatment design and management planning and therefore needs regular updating however operational quality monitoring is typically limited to wwtps and to standard water quality parameters such as oxygen demand and nutrient concentrations available compilations of urban runoff quality data from research oriented studies are outdated brombach et al 2005 smullen et al 1999 data on micropollutants are often insufficient to reliably estimate emissions on larger spatial scales hillenbrand et al 2016 this is due to the growing number of substances to be considered the large sampling effort and the costs of analysis in addition extensive accompanying data are required for the proper interpretation of the results the informative value of data compiled from different studies is often limited by differing sampling procedures insufficiently sensitive analytical methods or non comparable boundary conditions in addition the reported substance concentrations often exhibit stochastic variability which impedes the development of transferable quality models recently completed studies on behalf of the german environment agency fuchs et al 2020b 2020a and the bavarian environment agency nickel and fuchs 2020 therefore addressed two main data needs up to date data on urban runoff quality and reliable data for the quantification of micropollutant emissions from uws on river basin level as required under eu legislation therefore the main focus was on regulated priority substances european commission 2013 here the analytical results of these studies were combined to provide a high quality comprehensive dataset which allows an up to date assessment of urban wastewater and stormwater quality that is representative of the situation in germany 2 methods 2 1 monitoring strategy and sampling locations from 2016 to 2019 sampling campaigns were conducted to collect new data on the pollution of wastewater and stormwater in germany fuchs et al 2020b 2020a nickel and fuchs 2020 one mutual objective of the studies was to improve the database for the nation wide calculation of substance emissions into surface waters with the model more fuchs et al 2017b 2017a therefore all campaigns aimed to collect data as representative as possible of the main emission pathways from urban areas into surface water bodies i e wwtps csos and ssos fig 1 spatial variability was taken into account by selecting multiple sampling locations with different characteristics temporal variability was accounted for by using long term composite samples and sampling periods of more than 1 year all sampling procedures and analytical methods were carried out following strictly harmonised protocols for investigation of the wwtp effluent quality 49 wwtps of various sizes equipped with different process technologies were selected the capacities of the selected wwtps ranged from 1500 to 1 600 000 population equivalents pe table a 1 the fraction of catchment area drained by a combined sewer system ranged from 0 to 100 with a median of 60 treatment steps common to all selected wwtps were primary sedimentation conventional activated sludge treatment with chemical precipitation of phosphorus and secondary clarification none of the wwtps had advanced treatment processes for micropollutant removal in operation the wwtps were spatially distributed across germany fig a 1 five wwtps were selected for additional detailed investigations at these sites samples were also collected from the influent ten of the 12 csos were sampled on behalf of the bavarian environment agency and were located in bavaria fig a 1 two ssos were selected all csos were facilities with storage volume eight of these facilities were sedimentation tanks and samples were collected from the tank overflow also both ssos were overflows from sedimentation tanks catchment sizes ranged from 44 to 3850 ha table a 2 the median specific volume of 22 m³ ha impervious catchment area of the selected sites min 10 max 89 m³ ha was typical of the average storage volume targeted by combined sewage treatment design in germany in separate systems the provision of treatment capacity for stormwater is less common despite the fact that 46 of the population in germany is connected to separate systems there are only 2 8 million m³ of treatment capacity available in separate systems as opposed to 16 million m³ in combined systems dettmar and brombach 2019 2 2 sampling of wastewater treatment plant in and effluents wwtps were sampled monthly for a period of 1 to 1 5 years effluent samples were collected from the secondary clarifier outlet except for three sites where effluent samples were collected after a final filtration step and seven sites where effluent samples were collected at the outlet of tertiary treatment ponds influent samples were always collected from the inlet of the primary sedimentation tank 7 day composite samples were collected using preinstalled autosamplers of the wwtps since the same autosamplers were also used for routine operational monitoring of the wwtps the sampling regimes varied according to local preferences the sampling was flow proportional at about half of the wwtps and time proportional at the other half each day a 24 h composite sample of 1 l was collected dry and wet weather days were distinguished based on a site specific daily inflow threshold ranging between 1 2 and 2 6 multiples of dry weather flow the 24 h sample was then filled into one of two 10 l stainless steel vessels for dry and wet weather composite samples and kept deep frozen at 18 c until the completion of one 7 day period 2 3 sampling of combined sewer overflows and stormwater outfalls all csos located in bavaria were sampled for a total period of 2 to 3 years csos outside bavaria for 1 5 years the event dependent sampling was conducted with large volume samplers lvs which were triggered by flow measurements based on water level sensors volume proportional composite samples of up to 1000 l were collected in stainless steel tanks this allowed to capture even large events for their full duration the samples were homogenised using a submersible pump to collect subsamples of 0 1 to 2 l as required for different analyzes the method has been described in detail elsewhere nickel and fuchs 2019 the sampling of ssos was conducted with the same method as described for csos at one of the two sites an autosampler was used instead of a lvs to collect the composite samples 2 4 selection of substances one main objective of the sampling campaigns was to address data requirements for regulated priority substances a selection of almost 100 different substances was considered including mainly priority substances according to directive 2013 39 eu european commission 2013 substances with national eqs according to the german ordinance on the protection of surface waters ogewv 2016 biocides proposed for monitoring in a previous prioritisation study rüdel et al 2017 and few others among the substances were 40 biocides and pesticides 16 pah 16 pfas 12 metals 8 pharmaceuticals 3 benzotriazoles 2 phenols acesulfame ace di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp and hexabromocyclododecanes hbcdd however the lists of substances analyzed at each sampling point differed slightly and several substances were analyzed in samples from selected wwtps or csos only this resulted in differing numbers of sites and samples for individual substances which are reported with the results a full list of substances is found in table a 3 2 5 analytical methods wwtp samples were defrosted at room temperature for 1 to 2 days following homogenisation by repeated manual shaking aliquots were filled into amber bottles for the analysis of organic pollutants and polyethylene bottles for the analysis of metals the subsamples for metal analysis were stabilised with 1 volume of concentrated nitric acid cso and sso samples were already bottled stabilised and cooled on site nickel and fuchs 2019 all samples were stored at 4 c until analysis the analytical methods were adapted to the respective matrices and optimised to ensure low limits of quantification loq which were below or at least in the range of eqs for most substances methods were also adjusted to ensure that all concentrations refer to the total content of a substance in the samples i e the sum of particulate and dissolved fractions loq are reported in table a 3 a list of the analytical methods used is provided in table a 4 standard water quality parameters including total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen bound tnb and total phosphorus tp were analyzed in all samples from csos ssos and five wwtps selected for detailed investigations 2 6 data analysis 2 6 1 statistics for the evaluation of the data median values and 80 interquantile ranges 10th 90th percentile were calculated replacing values loq by loq 2 the frequency of values loq was reported to indicate the quality of the statistics if medians or quantiles resulted in values loq they were not reported 2 6 2 removal rates wwtp influent concentrations cin and effluent concentrations cout from the same sampling period were paired to calculate the removal rate rr according to eq 1 if influent concentrations were loq removal rates were not calculated 1 r r c i n c o u t c i n 2 6 3 mixing ratios in combined sewer overflow mixing ratios of stormwater and wastewater in the cso samples were estimated using the artificial sweetener ace as a wastewater marker site specific dry weather wastewater concentrations were not available and were therefore assumed to range from 20 to 60 µg l based on wwtp influent concentrations reported in the literature launay et al 2016 sacher and thoma 2014 scheurer et al 2009 2011 the mixing ratio was then calculated using wastewater concentrations randomly sampled from a uniform distribution within these boundaries stormwater concentrations of ace were assumed to be zero 2 6 4 volume weighted site mean concentrations site mean concentrations smcs were calculated by weighting the single concentration measurements ci at each site with the volume vi represented by the sample according to eq 2 for wwtps the sum of the daily inflow of all days in the multi day composite sample was used for csos and ssos the fraction of event volume that had been sampled was used only events that had been sampled to at least 50 were considered smcs of substances with 50 of samples loq at the site were reported as loq 2 2 s m c i 1 n c i v i i 1 n v i 2 6 5 per capita loads to compare emissions from cso and wwtp annual per capita loads pcl were calculated for each site using volume weighted smc annual discharge volume av and population equivalents pe as shown in eq 3 3 p c l s m c a v p e for wwtps per capita loads were calculated based on the annual discharge volume measured in 2016 and the connected pe for csos per capita loads were calculated based on the average annual cso volume measured during the monitoring campaign and the number of inhabitants in the directly connected catchment area sso per capita loads were not calculated because population data were not available and because connected area is considered a more appropriate basis for comparing loads from separate system outlets 3 results and discussion 3 1 scope and quality of the datasets the data compiled from the sampling campaigns comprises analytical results for standard water quality parameters and 79 substances in wwtp influents and effluents 95 substances in csos and 77 substances in ssos the number of sites and the number of samples vary for the individual substances tables a 5 a 8 the largest datasets are available for wwtp effluent up to 1000 multi day composite samples and cso concentrations up to 157 event composite samples since only five wwtps were selected for detailed investigations including influent sampling the influent dataset covers less spatial variability sso data is available from 20 events at two sites the wwtp composite sampling integrated concentration fluctuations over 7 days in approximately 70 of the samples the other part of the samples included 7 days due to variable weather conditions therefore the samples are referred to as multi day composite samples there were no systematic concentration differences between flow proportional and time proportional samples fuchs et al 2020b all samples were considered equally in the evaluations the samples collected from csos and ssos covered a wide range of event characteristics that reflect the rainfall variability during the sampling periods the 80 interquantiles of event durations and volumes were 2 20 h and 850 12 000 m³ respectively for ten csos a complete record of events during the sampling period was available this allowed to confirm that the sampled events were representative of all events in the sampling period but with a tendency towards events with higher volume duration and intensity nickel and fuchs 2020 by using lvs for sampling of csos and ssos the majority of events 72 could be covered to their full extent and 90 of the composite samples represented at least 60 of the event volume therefore the results represent reliable estimates of event mean concentrations ten events were excluded from these statistics because volume and duration could not be determined due to technical problems or measurement error for 32 of the substances analyzed in wwtp effluents and 30 of the substances analyzed in wwtp influents more than 50 of concentrations were loq the concentration ranges total content found for these substances are shown in fig 2 the frequency of values loq affects the usability of the datasets for calculating emissions fuchs et al 2010 and is considered an important quality criterion reflecting the sensitivity of analytical methods in wwtp effluents high frequencies of values loq were found for metals 68 the plasticiser dehp 100 and the low molecular weight pah fluorene fl phenanthrene phe fluoranthene fluo and pyrene pyr 80 for pfas biocides and pesticides the frequency of values loq varied largely between the individual substances the priority substances perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos terbutryn tby diuron diu and isoproturon iso could be quantified in 70 of the samples a total of 28 substances had less than 5 of values loq among these were mainly biocides and pesticides many of which are no longer approved in germany as well as several pfas and pah table a 6 no final conclusion can be made regarding the contribution of wwtps to the pollution of receiving waters for some of these substances since the methods used for analysis were not sufficiently sensitive especially in the case of the biocides cybutryne cypermethrin dichlorvos dicofol heptachlor and the flame retardant hbcdd loq exceeded annual average eqs aa eqs due to a higher complexity of the matrix loq were often higher for wwtp influents than for effluents consequently a total of 23 substances were never analyzed loq in samples from wwtp influents and 10 substances had less than 5 of values loq among these were mainly biocides pesticides and pfas table a 5 in cso and sso metals and dehp were quantified with concentrations loq in 100 of the samples pah in 85 except for naphthalene nap 40 in ssos and 82 in csos and phenols 60 fig 3 the frequency of values loq of individual pfas in ssos correlated with those in wwtp effluents and csos for biocides the results differed individually probably due to differences in applications transport pathways and environmental behaviour tables a 7 and a 8 pharmaceuticals benzotriazoles and ace were only analyzed in csos and were found at concentrations loq in 84 of the samples fig 4 3 2 substance concentrations and comparison with literature data despite the composite sampling approaches concentrations ranged across one up to three orders of magnitude for individual substances figs 2 4 concentrations in wwtp influents effluents csos and ssos did not follow normal distributions but often approached lognormal distributions instead consequently the median was used as an adequate central value an overview of median concentrations and 80 interquantile ranges of selected substances from all substances groups is found in table 1 the complete results for all substances are reported in the appendix tables a 5 a 8 water quality parameters are also reported in the appendix tables a 10 a 13 several studies from baden württemberg lambert et al 2014 lubw 2019 sacher and thoma 2014 austria clara et al 2017b 2017a and other european regions loos et al 2012 which were conducted with comparable methodology and a similar selection of substances were used to compare the substance concentrations for these studies comparisons were possible on the basis of single values wwtp effluent concentrations showed good agreement with the literature data e g for metals dehp and the biocides diethyltoluamide deet diu iso and tby similar concentration ranges were also found for pah pfas and phenols but the results were more variable and had more values loq in the datasets for csos and ssos less literature data were available than for wwtps both in terms of the number of facilities sampled and sample sizes because single values were not available for most studies comparisons were made using the reported central values preferably medians and ranges with few exceptions e g cr fe significant differences of substance concentrations between cso sites in this study were found kruskal wallis test p 0 05 therefore when comparing the resulting median concentrations and ranges to published data from other sites collected with different methods both confirmatory and deviating results may be expected good agreement with other studies from germany and austria christoffels et al 2016 clara et al 2014 engelmann et al 2016 launay et al 2016 was found for metals pharmaceuticals benzotriazoles dehp and ace more heterogeneous results were found for pah biocides and pesticides mutzner et al reported ranges of time weighted average concentrations obtained by passive sampling of 95 events at 20 csos in switzerland mutzner et al 2020 these were comparable to our results for benzotriazole btr carbamazepine cbz and diclofenac dcf but considerably higher for the biocides carbendazim czim diu and mecoprop mcpp however values loq were excluded for summarisation by the authors and results were stated to be likely overestimated due to the correction factors applied mutzner et al 2020 results from csos in france were comparable for metals becouze lareure et al 2019 and tended to be higher for pah and biocides gasperi et al 2012 paijens et al 2021 mean concentrations of diclofenac in british csos were very close to our results kay et al 2017 sso concentrations were compared to stormwater concentrations measured at sites in germany wicke et al 2021 austria clara et al 2014 france becouze lareure et al 2019 zgheib et al 2012 and sweden björklund et al 2009 kalmykova et al 2013 wicke et al 2021 reported concentrations in stormwater runoff from five catchments of 2 6 37 ha with contrasted land uses in berlin concentrations of metals and pah tended to be higher than shown by our results good agreement was found for metals and dehp with few results of samples collected in storm sewers in two catchments in austria while pah concentrations were lower clara et al 2014 swedish results for pah and dehp were close to ours but not for phenols björklund et al 2009 kalmykova et al 2013 considering the variability expected due to differences between regions sewer systems and sampling methods good agreement with literature data was found for cso and sso concentrations nevertheless most existing studies analyzed stormwater that was discharged untreated while the samples in this study were collected from sedimentation facilities this may especially affect the concentration of pollutants adsorbed to particles since in germany ssos without treatment are more common more data on these direct ssos should be acquired 3 3 relation of concentrations between sampling points and to eqs fig 5 displays the concentrations of selected substances in wwtp influents effluents csos and ssos in relation tcs is an example of a wastewater associated substance the highest tcs concentrations were analyzed in wwtp influents while concentrations in stormwater sso were loq 0 01 µg l similar results were obtained for deet 1 2 benzisothiazolin 3 2h on bit permethrin pmn and imidacloprid imi in contrast the concentrations of benzo ghi perylene bghip in sso systematically exceeded wwtp influent concentrations likewise median concentrations of most pah lead 4 tert octylphenol 4inp and diu were highest in ssos for other metals as well as the biocides tby and czim ssos and wwtp influents showed a similar concentration range significant input of these substances into uws occurs with stormwater runoff for pah and 4inp street runoff traffic is known to be one important source wicke et al 2021 björklund 2010 diu tby and czim in stormwater runoff originate from leaching of building materials burkhardt et al 2007 2012 paijens et al 2021 cso concentrations were typically found in a plausible range between wastewater i e wwtp influent and stormwater sso concentrations the ace based median mixing ratio across all samples was 16 4 95 confidence interval 8 6 25 0 corresponding to a stormwater content of 94 this result complies well with the ratios of average wwtp influent and cso concentrations of other wastewater related substances like triclosan tcs however for substances with significant input through stormwater e g bghip and tby these simple mixing assumptions do not produce consistent results it can be concluded that mobilisation and transport processes are too complex and result in highly variable concentrations in both stormwater runoff and wastewater this means that cso concentrations cannot be reliably predicted for each individual compound by assuming a mixing of wastewater and stormwater wwtp effluent concentrations of pfos dehp benzo a pyrene bap and tcs frequently exceeded aa eqs for these substances the receiving water quality depends largely on the dilution capacity sso and cso median concentrations of the pah bghip bap indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene ip chrysene chr and benzo b fluoranthene bbf exceeded wwtp effluent concentrations by factors of 100 and 50 respectively this means that despite non continuous activity emissions from ssos and csos contribute a significant share to total pah emissions from urban areas nickel and fuchs 2019 cso and sso concentrations of bghip bbf and benzo k fluoranthene bkf can potentially be highly relevant to mac eqs maximum acceptable concentration eqs exceedance in receiving waters considering that due to event composite sampling maximum concentrations were not captured 3 4 removal rates in wwtps the removal rates estimated in five selected wwtps are shown in fig 6 all removal rates are also summarised in the appendix table a 9 overall median removal rates table 1 were comparable to literature data and often in the upper range of reported values luo et al 2014 margot et al 2015 of the substances considered in this study mainly those with a high sorption affinity showed good removal in wwtps the removal of metals was very high median 90 with the exceptions of zinc 86 and nickel 47 likewise all pah were removed efficiently except for nap fl and acenaphthylene acy median pah removal was 90 and varied within narrow ranges only fig 6 removal increased with pah molecule size and resulting hydrophobicity another example of predominantly particle bound substances with very high removal was tcs 92 the concentration drop from wwtp influent to effluent is clearly visible for both tcs and bghip in fig 5 on the contrary substances whose elimination can be expected to depend mainly on biodegradation showed more variable often poor and sometimes negative removal rates e g several biocides including diu fig 6 for most substances considered in this study negative values can be regarded as outliers resulting from concentration variability or uncertainties in sampling and analysis however for some biocides e g diu poor or negative removal has been observed before e g paijens et al 2021 and could be due to transformation of metabolites or transformation products during wastewater treatment köck schulmeyer et al 2013 negative removal due to biotransformation of precursors has also been reported for pfas murakami et al 2009 however these explanations could not be verified based on our results 3 5 variability between sites and samples for most micropollutants considerable concentration variability was observed both between sampling sites and between samples at each site to compare the concentration variability resulting from differences between the sites to the variability between samples the cv of site median concentrations and the arithmetic mean cv of concentrations of single samples at each site were considered table a 14 fig 7 shows the effluent concentrations of each wwtp of two example substances with different origins and environmental behaviour particulate or dissolved transport from the example of dehp it can be seen that site median concentrations fall within a comparably narrow range temporal variability at each site mean cv 1 1 exceeded the differences between site medians cv 0 61 this finding can be attributed to the ubiquitous occurrence of dehp and high removal rates in wwtps due to the sorption affinity of the substance the biocide czim known to leach off building facades exposed to rainfall burkhardt et al 2007 and attributed to dissolved transport and poor removal in wwtp margot et al 2015 showed more site specific concentrations differences between the sampling sites cv 1 6 were more pronounced than temporal variability at each site mean cv 0 54 this means that characteristics of the catchment e g type or age of building materials used rainfall characteristics or the wwtp removal performance might systematically cause increased or decreased concentrations the removal of czim which depends mainly on biodegradation margot et al 2015 was found to be low median 27 and highly variable 80 interquantile 4 5 76 however considering the five wwtps selected for detailed investigation czim removal rates are not sufficient to explain site to site effluent concentration differences few substances showed the differentiated behaviour of these examples substances with comparably low overall concentration variability in wwtp effluents included tcs and the ubiquitous metal nickel both cv of site medians and mean cv of samples at each site 0 39 very high variability was observed for most pfas some of which showed high variability between sites in csos all pah showed lower variability between sites than between events czim concentrations were again more influenced by site specific differences for other substances neither variability between sites nor between events was dominant given the size of the datasets the impacts of documented catchment characteristics and hydraulic conditions on concentrations in wwtp effluents and csos were investigated by correlation analysis and visual inspection of scatterplots this included testing for the impact of population density and flow on wwtp effluent concentrations and population density land use event volume and maximum flow on cso concentrations overall despite the large volume of data none of the catchment characteristics could be identified as a main factor for wwtp effluent or cso concentrations meaningful results were found for few individual substances only figs a 2 a 3 the relationships found cannot be considered unambiguous or transferable similarly the influence of hydraulic conditions was not systematic and could only be confirmed for part of the wwtps or csos respectively figs a 4 a 5 seasonal trends were found for several pahs in both wwtp effluents and csos figs a 6 a 7 during the winter months the frequency of values loq was higher and or concentrations were elevated this was expected due to increased primary emissions caused by heating and increased deposition caused by reduced wind speeds and lower humidity manzetti 2013 for 4inp few pfas e g perfluoro n nonanoic acid pfna perfluorodecanoic acid pfda and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and biocides e g diu iso counter directional seasonal trends with increased concentrations in summer and autumn months were found in wwtp effluents for pfas this may be due to increased precipitation in summer as significant loads of pfas may originate from street runoff murakami et al 2009 müller et al 2011 elevated concentrations of pfas in summer months or during the wet season have been reported for wwtp influents in australia pfna pfoa nguyen et al 2019 and sludge samples from wwtps in china total concentrations of perfluorinated compounds na et al 2020 however higher concentrations of pfas could not be related to higher wwtp inflow therefore a conclusive assessment of these effects was not possible in case of the biocides the increased concentrations in summer could be due to higher temperature and precipitation which in turn may promote increased release and wash off burkhardt et al 2012 the seasonal trends could also reflect the main application periods of biocides and pesticides in cso seasonal trends were found for the agricultural herbicides terbuthylazine and metolachlor which were mainly detected in concentrations loq from may to august the trends underline the importance of long term monitoring overall the variability of substance concentrations in uws the lack of adequate explanations for concentration differences as well as seasonal trends of certain substances need to be taken into account for the collection and use of representative monitoring data generally a large sample size from each sampling site is required to capture as much of the variability as possible therefore for the objective of deriving representative concentrations long term monitoring of individual sites should be prioritised over the inclusion of additional sampling sites however for substances with high site to site differences also sampling of multiple sites will be needed for a comprehensive assessment 3 6 volume weighted site mean concentrations volume weighted smcs are considered to be the most appropriate quantity for the calculation of long term loads may and sivakumar 2013 mourad et al 2005 smcs were calculated for wwtp effluents csos and ssos if volume data was available this was possible for up to 49 wwtps 11 csos and both ssos median values of the resulting smc distributions of selected substances are reported in table 2 smc ranges and information on the number of sites considered are reported for all substances in the appendix tables a 15 a 17 for substances with a high frequency of values loq the median smc can be considered a reliable summary value that integrates considerable spatial and temporal variability it represents a cross section of the hydrological and topographical conditions the urban areas and the technical states of uws found in germany as such it qualifies to be used as representative input data for estimation of average substance emissions in large areas such as river basins if no specific data are available a median smc loq could be evaluated for 39 of substances analyzed in wwtp effluents 52 of substances analyzed in cso and 48 of substances analyzed in sso median smcs were close to the overall medians of the single values table 1 or slightly higher in most cases 3 7 per capita loads based on the smcs annual per capita loads from wwtps and csos were evaluated these are considered a suitable basis for a comparison of the relative contribution of these pathways to the total load from uws to receiving waters the per capita loads varied considerably between sites in addition to site to site concentration differences this might be due to uncertainties of the volume and population data used for the calculations table a 18 the highest median per capita loads of priority substances from wwtps were found for nickel 324 mg capita year dehp 176 mg capita year and lead 9 8 mg capita year for metals diu 1 23 mg capita year and iso 1 32 mg capita year median per capita loads were in the same order of magnitude but 8 55 lower than emission factors used for e prtr european pollutant release and transfer register reporting in the netherlands which were based on the sampling of six representative wwtps baltussen 2019 mercury loads from wwtps 0 17 mg capita year were lower than reported for switzerland 0 57 mg capita year suess et al 2020 and austria 0 84 0 95 mg capita year clara et al 2014 but loads of nickel and cadmium were within 25 of the austrian results biocide loads matched well with values reported for the paris conurbation for diu and tby but were one order of magnitude higher for iso paijens et al 2021 the differences may be due to methodological differences in both the data collection and the calculation of the loads but are also influenced by national differences in substance occurrence and use patterns sewer systems and wastewater treatment overall the good comparability with average per capita loads from wwtps in other european countries shows that a reliable new database has been established for germany to assess the relative importance of csos the loads were normalised to the median load from wwtps fig 8 the most pronounced differences were found for biocides and pah biocide loads from wwtps exceeded cso loads by one order of magnitude paijens et al 2021 also found that wwtps were the main pathway for biocides compared to csos however cso loads of lead cadmium mercury and pah were in the same range or higher than wwtp loads cso loads of high molecular weight pah exceeded wwtp loads by up to one order of magnitude pah are efficiently removed in wwtps and effluent concentrations were often loq therefore a significantly higher load from csos than from wwtps can also be assumed for pah not shown in fig 8 due to values loq e g bghip table a 18 the importance of csos for the emission of metals and pah has been reported previously becouze lareure et al 2019 launay et al 2016 clara et al 2014 and can be confirmed based on our results 4 conclusions a comprehensive dataset of pollutant concentrations in german uws is available from recently completed monitoring projects for wwtp effluents and csos it represents one of the largest datasets regarding the number of sites sampled with harmonised methodology and the total number of samples due to sensitive analytical methods many substances could be analyzed in concentrations loq in a high percentage of samples the data provide a consistent and reliable information base on pollutant occurrence and concentrations which was previously not available for many substances the reported median values of distributions of volume weighted smcs integrate considerable spatial and temporal variability and can be used as representative input data for estimation of average substance emissions if no site specific data are available thus the data will contribute to the development of strategies to reduce emissions taking into account not only wwtps but also stormwater related discharges the results confirm the ubiquity of several priority pollutants in both wastewater and stormwater from an overall perspective the relation of concentrations between wwtps csos and ssos can be explained primarily by the main areas of application and origin and the environmental behaviour i e removal in wwtp due to adsorption or biodegradation of individual substances this means that monitoring in uws could focus on indicator substances representing different expressions of these characteristics or new pollutants that cannot be characterised yet removal rates of particle bound pollutants in conventional wwtps were high but additional measures are needed in order to improve the removal of other substances e g biocides and pfas or to reduce effluent concentrations of dehp pfos and tcs which might cause eqs exceedances depending on dilution in receiving waters cso were confirmed as an important pathway of metals and pah to receiving waters when compared to wwtps on the basis of annual per capita loads despite the applied composite sampling approaches that provided integration of short term dynamics high concentration variability at each sampling point was observed the impact of catchment characteristics hydraulic conditions and seasonal trends on concentrations was investigated but showed meaningful results for few substances only the number of relevant influencing factors is huge it is therefore highly questionable whether it will be possible to map their complex combined impacts on concentrations in uws comprehensively this underlines the need of comprehensive monitoring data for a representative assessment of long term average conditions which is required for quantifying substance emissions generally long term monitoring and a large sample size from each sampling site are required to capture as much of the variability as possible for the objective of deriving representative concentrations long term monitoring of individual sites should therefore be prioritised over the inclusion of additional sampling sites to account for the uncertainties associated with the variability of measured data probabilistic modelling can be used and provide a sound basis for informed management planning research data the full dataset of

16816,a comprehensive dataset of pollutant concentrations in german urban wastewater systems is available from recently completed monitoring projects it contains up to 1000 concentration values for each of 79 substances in wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents from 49 sites and up to 157 values for each of 95 substances in combined sewer overflows csos from 12 sites wwtp influents and stormwater outfalls were sampled to a lesser extent all sampling methods were harmonised and aimed at collecting event or multi day composite samples over periods of 1 year among the substances analysed were biocides and pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons perfluorinated alkyl substances metals pharmaceuticals benzotriazoles phenols acesulfame di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate and hexabromocyclododecanes occurrence concentration ranges and removal rates of selected wwtps are presented csos can be confirmed as an important pathway of metals and pah to receiving waters when compared to wwtps on the basis of annual per capita loads the derived volume weighted site mean concentrations are qualified to be used as representative input data for estimation of average substance

not only wwtps but also stormwater related discharges graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water quality priority substances micropollutants wastewater treatment plant combined sewer overflow stormwater outfall 1 introduction state of the art wastewater treatment plants wwtps are highly effective in removing suspended solids biodegradable organic matter and nutrients still wastewater discharges from urban areas are among the main pressures on surface water quality kristensen et al 2018 in addition to continuous emissions from wwtps increased attention needs to be paid to non continuous stormwater related emissions from urban wastewater systems uws these are stormwater outfalls ssos in separate sewer systems and combined sewer overflows csos in combined sewer systems ssos and csos may contribute significant shares to the total emission from uws depending on the pollutant considered fuchs and toshovski 2016 consequently a holistic assessment of the emissions from both wastewater and stormwater treatment is needed to manage surface water pollution effectively the increasing contamination of surface water bodies with micropollutants is one of the major challenges for water management schwarzenbach et al 2006 new chemicals are developed produced and brought to application at a rapid pace at the same time the uncertainties regarding ecotoxicological risks connected to the emission of these substances are high schwarzenbach et al 2006 several groups of substances show ubiquitous environmental occurrence such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah or per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances pfas only 38 of the surface water bodies in the eu are in a good chemical status according to environmental quality standards eqs kristensen et al 2018 certain persistent mobile and toxic substances might become increasingly challenging for water supplies rüdel et al 2020 while advanced treatment processes for the elimination of micropollutants e g adsorption or oxidation are being developed and implemented in wwtps eggen et al 2014 luo et al 2014 emissions from ssos and csos are so far rarely considered information on the quality of wastewater and stormwater is used for treatment design and management planning and therefore needs regular updating however operational quality monitoring is typically limited to wwtps and to standard water quality parameters such as oxygen demand and nutrient concentrations available compilations of urban runoff quality data from research oriented studies are outdated brombach et al 2005 smullen et al 1999 data on micropollutants are often insufficient to reliably estimate emissions on larger spatial scales hillenbrand et al 2016 this is due to the growing number of substances to be considered the large sampling effort and the costs of analysis in addition extensive accompanying data are required for the proper interpretation of the results the informative value of data compiled from different studies is often limited by differing sampling procedures insufficiently sensitive analytical methods or non comparable boundary conditions in addition the reported substance concentrations often exhibit stochastic variability which impedes the development of transferable quality models recently completed studies on behalf of the german environment agency fuchs et al 2020b 2020a and the bavarian environment agency nickel and fuchs 2020 therefore addressed two main data needs up to date data on urban runoff quality and reliable data for the quantification of micropollutant emissions from uws on river basin level as required under eu legislation therefore the main focus was on regulated priority substances european commission 2013 here the analytical results of these studies were combined to provide a high quality comprehensive dataset which allows an up to date assessment of urban wastewater and stormwater quality that is representative of the situation in germany 2 methods 2 1 monitoring strategy and sampling locations from 2016 to 2019 sampling campaigns were conducted to collect new data on the pollution of wastewater and stormwater in germany fuchs et al 2020b 2020a nickel and fuchs 2020 one mutual objective of the studies was to improve the database for the nation wide calculation of substance emissions into surface waters with the model more fuchs et al 2017b 2017a therefore all campaigns aimed to collect data as representative as possible of the main emission pathways from urban areas into surface water bodies i e wwtps csos and ssos fig 1 spatial variability was taken into account by selecting multiple sampling locations with different characteristics temporal variability was accounted for by using long term composite samples and sampling periods of more than 1 year all sampling procedures and analytical methods were carried out following strictly harmonised protocols for investigation of the wwtp effluent quality 49 wwtps of various sizes equipped with different process technologies were selected the capacities of the selected wwtps ranged from 1500 to 1 600 000 population equivalents pe table a 1 the fraction of catchment area drained by a combined sewer system ranged from 0 to 100 with a median of 60 treatment steps common to all selected wwtps were primary sedimentation conventional activated sludge treatment with chemical precipitation of phosphorus and secondary clarification none of the wwtps had advanced treatment processes for micropollutant removal in operation the wwtps were spatially distributed across germany fig a 1 five wwtps were selected for additional detailed investigations at these sites samples were also collected from the influent ten of the 12 csos were sampled on behalf of the bavarian environment agency and were located in bavaria fig a 1 two ssos were selected all csos were facilities with storage volume eight of these facilities were sedimentation tanks and samples were collected from the tank overflow also both ssos were overflows from sedimentation tanks catchment sizes ranged from 44 to 3850 ha table a 2 the median specific volume of 22 m³ ha impervious catchment area of the selected sites min 10 max 89 m³ ha was typical of the average storage volume targeted by combined sewage treatment design in germany in separate systems the provision of treatment capacity for stormwater is less common despite the fact that 46 of the population in germany is connected to separate systems there are only 2 8 million m³ of treatment capacity available in separate systems as opposed to 16 million m³ in combined systems dettmar and brombach 2019 2 2 sampling of wastewater treatment plant in and effluents wwtps were sampled monthly for a period of 1 to 1 5 years effluent samples were collected from the secondary clarifier outlet except for three sites where effluent samples were collected after a final filtration step and seven sites where effluent samples were collected at the outlet of tertiary treatment ponds influent samples were always collected from the inlet of the primary sedimentation tank 7 day composite samples were collected using preinstalled autosamplers of the wwtps since the same autosamplers were also used for routine operational monitoring of the wwtps the sampling regimes varied according to local preferences the sampling was flow proportional at about half of the wwtps and time proportional at the other half each day a 24 h composite sample of 1 l was collected dry and wet weather days were distinguished based on a site specific daily inflow threshold ranging between 1 2 and 2 6 multiples of dry weather flow the 24 h sample was then filled into one of two 10 l stainless steel vessels for dry and wet weather composite samples and kept deep frozen at 18 c until the completion of one 7 day period 2 3 sampling of combined sewer overflows and stormwater outfalls all csos located in bavaria were sampled for a total period of 2 to 3 years csos outside bavaria for 1 5 years the event dependent sampling was conducted with large volume samplers lvs which were triggered by flow measurements based on water level sensors volume proportional composite samples of up to 1000 l were collected in stainless steel tanks this allowed to capture even large events for their full duration the samples were homogenised using a submersible pump to collect subsamples of 0 1 to 2 l as required for different analyzes the method has been described in detail elsewhere nickel and fuchs 2019 the sampling of ssos was conducted with the same method as described for csos at one of the two sites an autosampler was used instead of a lvs to collect the composite samples 2 4 selection of substances one main objective of the sampling campaigns was to address data requirements for regulated priority substances a selection of almost 100 different substances was considered including mainly priority substances according to directive 2013 39 eu european commission 2013 substances with national eqs according to the german ordinance on the protection of surface waters ogewv 2016 biocides proposed for monitoring in a previous prioritisation study rüdel et al 2017 and few others among the substances were 40 biocides and pesticides 16 pah 16 pfas 12 metals 8 pharmaceuticals 3 benzotriazoles 2 phenols acesulfame ace di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp and hexabromocyclododecanes hbcdd however the lists of substances analyzed at each sampling point differed slightly and several substances were analyzed in samples from selected wwtps or csos only this resulted in differing numbers of sites and samples for individual substances which are reported with the results a full list of substances is found in table a 3 2 5 analytical methods wwtp samples were defrosted at room temperature for 1 to 2 days following homogenisation by repeated manual shaking aliquots were filled into amber bottles for the analysis of organic pollutants and polyethylene bottles for the analysis of metals the subsamples for metal analysis were stabilised with 1 volume of concentrated nitric acid cso and sso samples were already bottled stabilised and cooled on site nickel and fuchs 2019 all samples were stored at 4 c until analysis the analytical methods were adapted to the respective matrices and optimised to ensure low limits of quantification loq which were below or at least in the range of eqs for most substances methods were also adjusted to ensure that all concentrations refer to the total content of a substance in the samples i e the sum of particulate and dissolved fractions loq are reported in table a 3 a list of the analytical methods used is provided in table a 4 standard water quality parameters including total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen bound tnb and total phosphorus tp were analyzed in all samples from csos ssos and five wwtps selected for detailed investigations 2 6 data analysis 2 6 1 statistics for the evaluation of the data median values and 80 interquantile ranges 10th 90th percentile were calculated replacing values loq by loq 2 the frequency of values loq was reported to indicate the quality of the statistics if medians or quantiles resulted in values loq they were not reported 2 6 2 removal rates wwtp influent concentrations cin and effluent concentrations cout from the same sampling period were paired to calculate the removal rate rr according to eq 1 if influent concentrations were loq removal rates were not calculated 1 r r c i n c o u t c i n 2 6 3 mixing ratios in combined sewer overflow mixing ratios of stormwater and wastewater in the cso samples were estimated using the artificial sweetener ace as a wastewater marker site specific dry weather wastewater concentrations were not available and were therefore assumed to range from 20 to 60 µg l based on wwtp influent concentrations reported in the literature launay et al 2016 sacher and thoma 2014 scheurer et al 2009 2011 the mixing ratio was then calculated using wastewater concentrations randomly sampled from a uniform distribution within these boundaries stormwater concentrations of ace were assumed to be zero 2 6 4 volume weighted site mean concentrations site mean concentrations smcs were calculated by weighting the single concentration measurements ci at each site with the volume vi represented by the sample according to eq 2 for wwtps the sum of the daily inflow of all days in the multi day composite sample was used for csos and ssos the fraction of event volume that had been sampled was used only events that had been sampled to at least 50 were considered smcs of substances with 50 of samples loq at the site were reported as loq 2 2 s m c i 1 n c i v i i 1 n v i 2 6 5 per capita loads to compare emissions from cso and wwtp annual per capita loads pcl were calculated for each site using volume weighted smc annual discharge volume av and population equivalents pe as shown in eq 3 3 p c l s m c a v p e for wwtps per capita loads were calculated based on the annual discharge volume measured in 2016 and the connected pe for csos per capita loads were calculated based on the average annual cso volume measured during the monitoring campaign and the number of inhabitants in the directly connected catchment area sso per capita loads were not calculated because population data were not available and because connected area is considered a more appropriate basis for comparing loads from separate system outlets 3 results and discussion 3 1 scope and quality of the datasets the data compiled from the sampling campaigns comprises analytical results for standard water quality parameters and 79 substances in wwtp influents and effluents 95 substances in csos and 77 substances in ssos the number of sites and the number of samples vary for the individual substances tables a 5 a 8 the largest datasets are available for wwtp effluent up to 1000 multi day composite samples and cso concentrations up to 157 event composite samples since only five wwtps were selected for detailed investigations including influent sampling the influent dataset covers less spatial variability sso data is available from 20 events at two sites the wwtp composite sampling integrated concentration fluctuations over 7 days in approximately 70 of the samples the other part of the samples included 7 days due to variable weather conditions therefore the samples are referred to as multi day composite samples there were no systematic concentration differences between flow proportional and time proportional samples fuchs et al 2020b all samples were considered equally in the evaluations the samples collected from csos and ssos covered a wide range of event characteristics that reflect the rainfall variability during the sampling periods the 80 interquantiles of event durations and volumes were 2 20 h and 850 12 000 m³ respectively for ten csos a complete record of events during the sampling period was available this allowed to confirm that the sampled events were representative of all events in the sampling period but with a tendency towards events with higher volume duration and intensity nickel and fuchs 2020 by using lvs for sampling of csos and ssos the majority of events 72 could be covered to their full extent and 90 of the composite samples represented at least 60 of the event volume therefore the results represent reliable estimates of event mean concentrations ten events were excluded from these statistics because volume and duration could not be determined due to technical problems or measurement error for 32 of the substances analyzed in wwtp effluents and 30 of the substances analyzed in wwtp influents more than 50 of concentrations were loq the concentration ranges total content found for these substances are shown in fig 2 the frequency of values loq affects the usability of the datasets for calculating emissions fuchs et al 2010 and is considered an important quality criterion reflecting the sensitivity of analytical methods in wwtp effluents high frequencies of values loq were found for metals 68 the plasticiser dehp 100 and the low molecular weight pah fluorene fl phenanthrene phe fluoranthene fluo and pyrene pyr 80 for pfas biocides and pesticides the frequency of values loq varied largely between the individual substances the priority substances perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos terbutryn tby diuron diu and isoproturon iso could be quantified in 70 of the samples a total of 28 substances had less than 5 of values loq among these were mainly biocides and pesticides many of which are no longer approved in germany as well as several pfas and pah table a 6 no final conclusion can be made regarding the contribution of wwtps to the pollution of receiving waters for some of these substances since the methods used for analysis were not sufficiently sensitive especially in the case of the biocides cybutryne cypermethrin dichlorvos dicofol heptachlor and the flame retardant hbcdd loq exceeded annual average eqs aa eqs due to a higher complexity of the matrix loq were often higher for wwtp influents than for effluents consequently a total of 23 substances were never analyzed loq in samples from wwtp influents and 10 substances had less than 5 of values loq among these were mainly biocides pesticides and pfas table a 5 in cso and sso metals and dehp were quantified with concentrations loq in 100 of the samples pah in 85 except for naphthalene nap 40 in ssos and 82 in csos and phenols 60 fig 3 the frequency of values loq of individual pfas in ssos correlated with those in wwtp effluents and csos for biocides the results differed individually probably due to differences in applications transport pathways and environmental behaviour tables a 7 and a 8 pharmaceuticals benzotriazoles and ace were only analyzed in csos and were found at concentrations loq in 84 of the samples fig 4 3 2 substance concentrations and comparison with literature data despite the composite sampling approaches concentrations ranged across one up to three orders of magnitude for individual substances figs 2 4 concentrations in wwtp influents effluents csos and ssos did not follow normal distributions but often approached lognormal distributions instead consequently the median was used as an adequate central value an overview of median concentrations and 80 interquantile ranges of selected substances from all substances groups is found in table 1 the complete results for all substances are reported in the appendix tables a 5 a 8 water quality parameters are also reported in the appendix tables a 10 a 13 several studies from baden württemberg lambert et al 2014 lubw 2019 sacher and thoma 2014 austria clara et al 2017b 2017a and other european regions loos et al 2012 which were conducted with comparable methodology and a similar selection of substances were used to compare the substance concentrations for these studies comparisons were possible on the basis of single values wwtp effluent concentrations showed good agreement with the literature data e g for metals dehp and the biocides diethyltoluamide deet diu iso and tby similar concentration ranges were also found for pah pfas and phenols but the results were more variable and had more values loq in the datasets for csos and ssos less literature data were available than for wwtps both in terms of the number of facilities sampled and sample sizes because single values were not available for most studies comparisons were made using the reported central values preferably medians and ranges with few exceptions e g cr fe significant differences of substance concentrations between cso sites in this study were found kruskal wallis test p 0 05 therefore when comparing the resulting median concentrations and ranges to published data from other sites collected with different methods both confirmatory and deviating results may be expected good agreement with other studies from germany and austria christoffels et al 2016 clara et al 2014 engelmann et al 2016 launay et al 2016 was found for metals pharmaceuticals benzotriazoles dehp and ace more heterogeneous results were found for pah biocides and pesticides mutzner et al reported ranges of time weighted average concentrations obtained by passive sampling of 95 events at 20 csos in switzerland mutzner et al 2020 these were comparable to our results for benzotriazole btr carbamazepine cbz and diclofenac dcf but considerably higher for the biocides carbendazim czim diu and mecoprop mcpp however values loq were excluded for summarisation by the authors and results were stated to be likely overestimated due to the correction factors applied mutzner et al 2020 results from csos in france were comparable for metals becouze lareure et al 2019 and tended to be higher for pah and biocides gasperi et al 2012 paijens et al 2021 mean concentrations of diclofenac in british csos were very close to our results kay et al 2017 sso concentrations were compared to stormwater concentrations measured at sites in germany wicke et al 2021 austria clara et al 2014 france becouze lareure et al 2019 zgheib et al 2012 and sweden björklund et al 2009 kalmykova et al 2013 wicke et al 2021 reported concentrations in stormwater runoff from five catchments of 2 6 37 ha with contrasted land uses in berlin concentrations of metals and pah tended to be higher than shown by our results good agreement was found for metals and dehp with few results of samples collected in storm sewers in two catchments in austria while pah concentrations were lower clara et al 2014 swedish results for pah and dehp were close to ours but not for phenols björklund et al 2009 kalmykova et al 2013 considering the variability expected due to differences between regions sewer systems and sampling methods good agreement with literature data was found for cso and sso concentrations nevertheless most existing studies analyzed stormwater that was discharged untreated while the samples in this study were collected from sedimentation facilities this may especially affect the concentration of pollutants adsorbed to particles since in germany ssos without treatment are more common more data on these direct ssos should be acquired 3 3 relation of concentrations between sampling points and to eqs fig 5 displays the concentrations of selected substances in wwtp influents effluents csos and ssos in relation tcs is an example of a wastewater associated substance the highest tcs concentrations were analyzed in wwtp influents while concentrations in stormwater sso were loq 0 01 µg l similar results were obtained for deet 1 2 benzisothiazolin 3 2h on bit permethrin pmn and imidacloprid imi in contrast the concentrations of benzo ghi perylene bghip in sso systematically exceeded wwtp influent concentrations likewise median concentrations of most pah lead 4 tert octylphenol 4inp and diu were highest in ssos for other metals as well as the biocides tby and czim ssos and wwtp influents showed a similar concentration range significant input of these substances into uws occurs with stormwater runoff for pah and 4inp street runoff traffic is known to be one important source wicke et al 2021 björklund 2010 diu tby and czim in stormwater runoff originate from leaching of building materials burkhardt et al 2007 2012 paijens et al 2021 cso concentrations were typically found in a plausible range between wastewater i e wwtp influent and stormwater sso concentrations the ace based median mixing ratio across all samples was 16 4 95 confidence interval 8 6 25 0 corresponding to a stormwater content of 94 this result complies well with the ratios of average wwtp influent and cso concentrations of other wastewater related substances like triclosan tcs however for substances with significant input through stormwater e g bghip and tby these simple mixing assumptions do not produce consistent results it can be concluded that mobilisation and transport processes are too complex and result in highly variable concentrations in both stormwater runoff and wastewater this means that cso concentrations cannot be reliably predicted for each individual compound by assuming a mixing of wastewater and stormwater wwtp effluent concentrations of pfos dehp benzo a pyrene bap and tcs frequently exceeded aa eqs for these substances the receiving water quality depends largely on the dilution capacity sso and cso median concentrations of the pah bghip bap indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene ip chrysene chr and benzo b fluoranthene bbf exceeded wwtp effluent concentrations by factors of 100 and 50 respectively this means that despite non continuous activity emissions from ssos and csos contribute a significant share to total pah emissions from urban areas nickel and fuchs 2019 cso and sso concentrations of bghip bbf and benzo k fluoranthene bkf can potentially be highly relevant to mac eqs maximum acceptable concentration eqs exceedance in receiving waters considering that due to event composite sampling maximum concentrations were not captured 3 4 removal rates in wwtps the removal rates estimated in five selected wwtps are shown in fig 6 all removal rates are also summarised in the appendix table a 9 overall median removal rates table 1 were comparable to literature data and often in the upper range of reported values luo et al 2014 margot et al 2015 of the substances considered in this study mainly those with a high sorption affinity showed good removal in wwtps the removal of metals was very high median 90 with the exceptions of zinc 86 and nickel 47 likewise all pah were removed efficiently except for nap fl and acenaphthylene acy median pah removal was 90 and varied within narrow ranges only fig 6 removal increased with pah molecule size and resulting hydrophobicity another example of predominantly particle bound substances with very high removal was tcs 92 the concentration drop from wwtp influent to effluent is clearly visible for both tcs and bghip in fig 5 on the contrary substances whose elimination can be expected to depend mainly on biodegradation showed more variable often poor and sometimes negative removal rates e g several biocides including diu fig 6 for most substances considered in this study negative values can be regarded as outliers resulting from concentration variability or uncertainties in sampling and analysis however for some biocides e g diu poor or negative removal has been observed before e g paijens et al 2021 and could be due to transformation of metabolites or transformation products during wastewater treatment köck schulmeyer et al 2013 negative removal due to biotransformation of precursors has also been reported for pfas murakami et al 2009 however these explanations could not be verified based on our results 3 5 variability between sites and samples for most micropollutants considerable concentration variability was observed both between sampling sites and between samples at each site to compare the concentration variability resulting from differences between the sites to the variability between samples the cv of site median concentrations and the arithmetic mean cv of concentrations of single samples at each site were considered table a 14 fig 7 shows the effluent concentrations of each wwtp of two example substances with different origins and environmental behaviour particulate or dissolved transport from the example of dehp it can be seen that site median concentrations fall within a comparably narrow range temporal variability at each site mean cv 1 1 exceeded the differences between site medians cv 0 61 this finding can be attributed to the ubiquitous occurrence of dehp and high removal rates in wwtps due to the sorption affinity of the substance the biocide czim known to leach off building facades exposed to rainfall burkhardt et al 2007 and attributed to dissolved transport and poor removal in wwtp margot et al 2015 showed more site specific concentrations differences between the sampling sites cv 1 6 were more pronounced than temporal variability at each site mean cv 0 54 this means that characteristics of the catchment e g type or age of building materials used rainfall characteristics or the wwtp removal performance might systematically cause increased or decreased concentrations the removal of czim which depends mainly on biodegradation margot et al 2015 was found to be low median 27 and highly variable 80 interquantile 4 5 76 however considering the five wwtps selected for detailed investigation czim removal rates are not sufficient to explain site to site effluent concentration differences few substances showed the differentiated behaviour of these examples substances with comparably low overall concentration variability in wwtp effluents included tcs and the ubiquitous metal nickel both cv of site medians and mean cv of samples at each site 0 39 very high variability was observed for most pfas some of which showed high variability between sites in csos all pah showed lower variability between sites than between events czim concentrations were again more influenced by site specific differences for other substances neither variability between sites nor between events was dominant given the size of the datasets the impacts of documented catchment characteristics and hydraulic conditions on concentrations in wwtp effluents and csos were investigated by correlation analysis and visual inspection of scatterplots this included testing for the impact of population density and flow on wwtp effluent concentrations and population density land use event volume and maximum flow on cso concentrations overall despite the large volume of data none of the catchment characteristics could be identified as a main factor for wwtp effluent or cso concentrations meaningful results were found for few individual substances only figs a 2 a 3 the relationships found cannot be considered unambiguous or transferable similarly the influence of hydraulic conditions was not systematic and could only be confirmed for part of the wwtps or csos respectively figs a 4 a 5 seasonal trends were found for several pahs in both wwtp effluents and csos figs a 6 a 7 during the winter months the frequency of values loq was higher and or concentrations were elevated this was expected due to increased primary emissions caused by heating and increased deposition caused by reduced wind speeds and lower humidity manzetti 2013 for 4inp few pfas e g perfluoro n nonanoic acid pfna perfluorodecanoic acid pfda and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and biocides e g diu iso counter directional seasonal trends with increased concentrations in summer and autumn months were found in wwtp effluents for pfas this may be due to increased precipitation in summer as significant loads of pfas may originate from street runoff murakami et al 2009 müller et al 2011 elevated concentrations of pfas in summer months or during the wet season have been reported for wwtp influents in australia pfna pfoa nguyen et al 2019 and sludge samples from wwtps in china total concentrations of perfluorinated compounds na et al 2020 however higher concentrations of pfas could not be related to higher wwtp inflow therefore a conclusive assessment of these effects was not possible in case of the biocides the increased concentrations in summer could be due to higher temperature and precipitation which in turn may promote increased release and wash off burkhardt et al 2012 the seasonal trends could also reflect the main application periods of biocides and pesticides in cso seasonal trends were found for the agricultural herbicides terbuthylazine and metolachlor which were mainly detected in concentrations loq from may to august the trends underline the importance of long term monitoring overall the variability of substance concentrations in uws the lack of adequate explanations for concentration differences as well as seasonal trends of certain substances need to be taken into account for the collection and use of representative monitoring data generally a large sample size from each sampling site is required to capture as much of the variability as possible therefore for the objective of deriving representative concentrations long term monitoring of individual sites should be prioritised over the inclusion of additional sampling sites however for substances with high site to site differences also sampling of multiple sites will be needed for a comprehensive assessment 3 6 volume weighted site mean concentrations volume weighted smcs are considered to be the most appropriate quantity for the calculation of long term loads may and sivakumar 2013 mourad et al 2005 smcs were calculated for wwtp effluents csos and ssos if volume data was available this was possible for up to 49 wwtps 11 csos and both ssos median values of the resulting smc distributions of selected substances are reported in table 2 smc ranges and information on the number of sites considered are reported for all substances in the appendix tables a 15 a 17 for substances with a high frequency of values loq the median smc can be considered a reliable summary value that integrates considerable spatial and temporal variability it represents a cross section of the hydrological and topographical conditions the urban areas and the technical states of uws found in germany as such it qualifies to be used as representative input data for estimation of average substance emissions in large areas such as river basins if no specific data are available a median smc loq could be evaluated for 39 of substances analyzed in wwtp effluents 52 of substances analyzed in cso and 48 of substances analyzed in sso median smcs were close to the overall medians of the single values table 1 or slightly higher in most cases 3 7 per capita loads based on the smcs annual per capita loads from wwtps and csos were evaluated these are considered a suitable basis for a comparison of the relative contribution of these pathways to the total load from uws to receiving waters the per capita loads varied considerably between sites in addition to site to site concentration differences this might be due to uncertainties of the volume and population data used for the calculations table a 18 the highest median per capita loads of priority substances from wwtps were found for nickel 324 mg capita year dehp 176 mg capita year and lead 9 8 mg capita year for metals diu 1 23 mg capita year and iso 1 32 mg capita year median per capita loads were in the same order of magnitude but 8 55 lower than emission factors used for e prtr european pollutant release and transfer register reporting in the netherlands which were based on the sampling of six representative wwtps baltussen 2019 mercury loads from wwtps 0 17 mg capita year were lower than reported for switzerland 0 57 mg capita year suess et al 2020 and austria 0 84 0 95 mg capita year clara et al 2014 but loads of nickel and cadmium were within 25 of the austrian results biocide loads matched well with values reported for the paris conurbation for diu and tby but were one order of magnitude higher for iso paijens et al 2021 the differences may be due to methodological differences in both the data collection and the calculation of the loads but are also influenced by national differences in substance occurrence and use patterns sewer systems and wastewater treatment overall the good comparability with average per capita loads from wwtps in other european countries shows that a reliable new database has been established for germany to assess the relative importance of csos the loads were normalised to the median load from wwtps fig 8 the most pronounced differences were found for biocides and pah biocide loads from wwtps exceeded cso loads by one order of magnitude paijens et al 2021 also found that wwtps were the main pathway for biocides compared to csos however cso loads of lead cadmium mercury and pah were in the same range or higher than wwtp loads cso loads of high molecular weight pah exceeded wwtp loads by up to one order of magnitude pah are efficiently removed in wwtps and effluent concentrations were often loq therefore a significantly higher load from csos than from wwtps can also be assumed for pah not shown in fig 8 due to values loq e g bghip table a 18 the importance of csos for the emission of metals and pah has been reported previously becouze lareure et al 2019 launay et al 2016 clara et al 2014 and can be confirmed based on our results 4 conclusions a comprehensive dataset of pollutant concentrations in german uws is available from recently completed monitoring projects for wwtp effluents and csos it represents one of the largest datasets regarding the number of sites sampled with harmonised methodology and the total number of samples due to sensitive analytical methods many substances could be analyzed in concentrations loq in a high percentage of samples the data provide a consistent and reliable information base on pollutant occurrence and concentrations which was previously not available for many substances the reported median values of distributions of volume weighted smcs integrate considerable spatial and temporal variability and can be used as representative input data for estimation of average substance emissions if no site specific data are available thus the data will contribute to the development of strategies to reduce emissions taking into account not only wwtps but also stormwater related discharges the results confirm the ubiquity of several priority pollutants in both wastewater and stormwater from an overall perspective the relation of concentrations between wwtps csos and ssos can be explained primarily by the main areas of application and origin and the environmental behaviour i e removal in wwtp due to adsorption or biodegradation of individual substances this means that monitoring in uws could focus on indicator substances representing different expressions of these characteristics or new pollutants that cannot be characterised yet removal rates of particle bound pollutants in conventional wwtps were high but additional measures are needed in order to improve the removal of other substances e g biocides and pfas or to reduce effluent concentrations of dehp pfos and tcs which might cause eqs exceedances depending on dilution in receiving waters cso were confirmed as an important pathway of metals and pah to receiving waters when compared to wwtps on the basis of annual per capita loads despite the applied composite sampling approaches that provided integration of short term dynamics high concentration variability at each sampling point was observed the impact of catchment characteristics hydraulic conditions and seasonal trends on concentrations was investigated but showed meaningful results for few substances only the number of relevant influencing factors is huge it is therefore highly questionable whether it will be possible to map their complex combined impacts on concentrations in uws comprehensively this underlines the need of comprehensive monitoring data for a representative assessment of long term average conditions which is required for quantifying substance emissions generally long term monitoring and a large sample size from each sampling site are required to capture as much of the variability as possible for the objective of deriving representative concentrations long term monitoring of individual sites should therefore be prioritised over the inclusion of additional sampling sites to account for the uncertainties associated with the variability of measured data probabilistic modelling can be used and provide a sound basis for informed management planning research data the full dataset of

threats to the environment this study investigated how effective a stormwater treatment train was at removing rubber bitumen and other microplastics incl fibers fragments and paint particles in the 100 300 µm and 300 µm size fractions from highway runoff the two treatment trains comprise a gross pollutant trap gpt followed by either a vegetated bioretention cell or non vegetated sand filter flow proportional composite samples were taken from the highway runoff gpt outflow and the outflow from the two parallel filters during nine rain events to determine overall treatment performance as well as the performance of individual system components the identified rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles mainly represented the 100 300 µm fraction and included high ratios of rubber 30 and bitumen 60 overall the treatment train efficiently removed rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles in the 100 300 µm size fraction from the stormwater the filter cells accounted for a major share of this removal as the gpt did not reduce microplastic particle concentrations this observation is likely explained by the fact that the rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles have a density close to the density of water and thus removal by sedimentation is decreased this identified an inherent weakness of the system more specifically the high microplastic concentrations in the surface water of the gpt means there can be a risk of microplastic release through overflow pits when inflows surpass the system capacity despite some differences both the vegetated bioretention cell and the non vegetated sand filter removed rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles to similar extent graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stormwater biofilter pre sedimentation microplastic tyre wear bitumen microlitter 1 introduction microplastics can cause damage to both terrestrial and aquatic environments e g wagner et al 2018 and tian et al 2021 in addition to atmospheric deposition and industrial and household wastewater stormwater especially road runoff has been identified as a means through which microplastics entering the receiving water environment e g kole et al 2017 unice et al 2019 and halle et al 2020 important sources of microplastic are tire wear brake wear road wear and road paint wagner et al 2018 vijayan et al 2019 järlskog et al 2020 in the following tire wear bitumen plastic fibres plastic fragments and paint particles are grouped under the term microplastics which is in accordance with e g hartmann et al 2019 and järlskog et al 2020 tire wear and bitumen particles are not considered as plastics from a material science perspective but commonly included into the microplastic definition used in environmental sciences since they descend from manmade synthetic products of environmental concern hartmann et al 2019 järlskog et al 2020 despite the relevance of microplastic pollution from stormwater there is scarce empirical evidence regarding microplastics treatment in stormwater control measures ziajahromi et al 2020 studied microplastic occurrence in water and sediment from a floating treatment wetland interestingly they detected higher particle concentrations in the effluent than in the influent the identified particles also included certain black particles suspected to derive from car tires however their origin could not be confirmed it has been suggested that the microplastics in urban and highway runoff may be partly removed by sedimentation ponds but may require further treatment due to the presence of these particles in the water phase of treatment ponds liu et al 2019 2019 olesen et al 2019 however these studies investigated neither the treatment performances of the ponds nor analyzed specifically traffic related microplastics i e black particles from tire wear and bitumen klöckner et al 2019 sampled road runoff from a soil retention filter including pre sedimentation with the aim of developing an analytical method for traffic related microplastic although the treatment performance was not investigated the presented data imply that sedimentation processes alone may be insufficient to sufficiently remove microplastics which commonly have relatively low densities unice et al 2019 klöckner et al 2019 kooi and koelmans 2019 polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp particles will tend to float while heavier particles e g polystyrene ps or poly methyl 2 methylpropenoate pmma particles might settle but then easily be resuspended at subsequent storm events in summary these studies suggest that sedimentation only is insufficient for microplastics removal and further treatment steps are required stormwater bioretention systems which often include a pre sedimentation step e g forebay or gross pollutant trap gpt can be a suitable alternative for the treatment of microplastics bioretention systems effectively remove particulate stormwater contaminants e g suspended solids particulate metals particle associated pahs via filtration through a filter material e g davis et al 2009 however only two studies describe the microplastics treatment performance of bioretention notably gilbreath et al 2019 studied the effectiveness of an urban rain garden for microplastic treatment and suggest based on data covering three rain events only that bioretention systems could effectively treat microplastic particles 125 µm in addition smyth et al 2021 demonstrated that a bioretention cell at a parking lot was generally effective for removing microplastic particles 106 µm most bioretention systems have a limited stormwater capture capacity defined as the fraction of stormwater captured and filtered by the system when the system is exposed to high flows excess water is bypassed the filter via overflow pits zhang and guo 2014 this could affect the overall treatment of microplastic particles which commonly have lower densities than for instance mineral particles and subsequently show slower sedimentation rates klöckner et al 2019 unice et al 2019 thus particles either suspended in the stormwater or re suspended after having previously accumulated on top of the filter may be released when overflow occurs it should be noted that this potential risk was not discussed by either smyth et al 2021 or gilbreath et al 2019 no study has yet evaluated microplastic removal in bioretention systems equipped with a pre sedimentation forebay or gpt however we assume that pre sedimentation would not significantly affect the overall removal given that sedimentation is likely not sufficient to efficiently remove microplastics particularly not those composed of low density polymers klöckner et al 2019 in addition the pre sedimentation section prior to bioretention systems is of relatively small size compared to e g a stormwater pond furthermore both aforementioned bioretention studies gilbreath et al 2019 smyth et al 2021 investigated runoff from catchments with relatively little traffic as such using bioretention systems to remove microplastics from road runoff in areas with high traffic loads and thus probably higher microplastic concentrations has not yet been evaluated like vegetated bioretention non vegetated gravel sand filters have a high potential to remove total suspended solids tss and particle bound other pollutants zarezadeh et al 2018 and thus should also be applicable for microplastic removal however the treatment of microplastics in bioretention systems could be affected by inter alia vegetation as has previously been observed for tss and particulate metals lange et al 2020 hence the comparison of vegetated and unvegetated systems would shed light on how vegetation influences the treatment performance and which treatment potential stormwater sand gravel filters have in summary only two studies gilbreath et al 2019 smyth et al 2021 have described microplastics removal by bioretention which limits the generalizability of the results furthermore one of the studies only investigated three events and neither of them evaluates the role of overflow runoff from highly trafficked roads the influence of vegetation in bioretention or the effect of a pre sedimentation step this study aimed to investigate traffic related microplastic particle concentrations in highway runoff and to determine whether a stormwater treatment train consisting of a pre sedimentation gpt with an overflow pit in combination with either i a vegetated bioretention system or ii an unvegetated sand filter fig 1 can remove these microplastics measurements were carried out in a way that the contribution of all components of the treatment train could be evaluated separately the research included the following hypotheses i the filters rather than the gpt will reduce the concentrations of microplastic particles in stormwater and ii the sand filter and vegetated bioretention system will show comparable performance in the removal of these particles 2 methods 2 1 site description the stormwater treatment train located in sundsvall on sweden s baltic sea coast 62 23 0 5 n 17 20 50 5 e experiences seasonal changes with

area of 4 7 ha including 1 9 ha of motorway bridge e4 with average traffic of 13 250 vehicles day in 2019 and a motorway exit the stormwater treatment train consists of a gpt connected to either a subsequent vertical flow bioretention system or a non vegetated sand filter system the gpt has a volume of 47 m3 and consists of a sedimentation chamber where the overflow weir of the system is located and a compartment for oil separation the stormwater enters the gpt through a horizontal submerged pipe i e pipe top below water level the evaluated sections of the subsequent filter system have a total surface area of 470 m2 and consist of one vegetated bioretention cell and one non vegetated sand filter cell these filter cells are divided by a subsurface membrane made of ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm rubber such a membrane could be a potential source of microplastics however plastic degradation below the soil surface is considered generally as low bläsing and amelung 2018 the presence of separate underdrains means that the effluent can be sampled separately from each cell a third cell visible in fig 1 was not included in this study the bioretention system was

coefficient cu 0 27 during a rain event the water spreads evenly over the filter cells and rises to a maximum height of one meter in the case that the rain event exceeds the design capacity the stormwater bypasses over the overflow weir in the gpt and is discharged untreated to the receiving water at the start of the sampling the stormwater treatment train had been in operation for one year and four months 2 2 experimental setup and sampling volume proportional composite water samples were taken during nine rain events with varying characteristics table 1 in autumn 2019 and spring summer 2020 using automatic samplers isco6712 and 25 l white hdpe water canisters particles of the canisters were not detected in any of the samples to reliably assess the treatment performance of the biofilters it would have been desirable to include samples representing more than nine rain events however when compared to previous studies that examined removal of microplastics and other pollutants by stormwater bioretention systems the nine rain events in this study are in a common range smyth et al 2021 12 events gilbreath et al 2019 3 events chen et al 2013 10 events järlskog et al 2020 and piñon colin et al 2020 evaluated five and seven rain events respectively the sampled storm events in this study cover rains with different characteristics intensities varying between 0 9 and 8 8 mm h and rain depths between 6 2 and 23 6 mm and are thus representing a wide variety of events rain events less than 5 mm could not be included in the study since they did not generate sufficient runoff to the treatment facility since the rain volumes could not be predicted with absolute accuracy sample volumes varied from 1 8 to 20 l such variations are unavoidable when collecting flow proportional samples since neither precipitation nor filter outflow can be predicted exactly in advance when programming the automatic sampler an impact of the varying volumes on the results is not expected the flow proportional composite samples account for the variability during each rain events the samples were taken at five points fig 1 from the stormwater inflow abbreviated sw the outflow after treatment in the gpt which is equal to the filter inflow abbreviated gpt the outflow from the vegetated bioretention cell abbreviated f1 and the outflow from the non vegetated filter cell abbreviated f2 furthermore during rain events 1 2 and 9 grab samples were taken from the surface water 0 5 cm of the sedimentation compartment that was close to the overflow pit op this was done to estimate the potential release of microplastic from the overflow pit no overflow occurred during rain event 2 due to relatively low flows but an op sample was nevertheless taken rain data were obtained from a tipping bucket rain gauge isco 674 installed at a height of 2 5 m at the sampling site fig 1 for the last rain event 9 data were obtained from a weather station ca 0 2 km from the sampling site due to malfunctioning of this rain gauge the gpt outflow was steered by valves which opened when the water level in the chamber reached a maximum level after discharging a certain volume to the filter the valves close again these pulses were logged and used to trigger the sw and gpt samplers as well as to calculate stormwater inflow and outflow from the gpt outflow data for f1 and f2 were obtained from in pipe electromagnetic flowmeters installed in the outflow pipes of the bioretention systems the outflow samplers were triggered by these flowmeters rain and flow data for the nine events are summarized in table 1 antecedent dry days adds describe the days since the last rain event above 0 5 mm 24 h 2 3 microplastic analyses 2 3 1 processing of the water samples the canisters containing the stormwater were shaken to bring settled particulate matter into suspension next all the water was filtered in sequence over clean nylon filters mesh sizes 300 and 100 µm which were fitted in a stainless steel filter holder no vacuum suction was used a diameter of 5 mm was chosen as the upper microplastic particle size boundary based on recommendations from the un joint group of scientific experts of marine environmental protection gesamp 2019 the filters were then put in individual petri dishes filters with little organic and minerogenic material were analyzed without any pretreatment whereas filters in which the amount of such material hampered analysis were first treated with enzymes to remove organic matter other than the microplastic particles and if necessary density separated with a saturated solution of nai 1 85 g cm 3 to separate the lighter microplastic particles from the heavier mineral particles järlskog et al 2020 these treatments were required for some of the 100 µm filters the enzymatic treatment included treating the filters with pancreatic enzymes creon 40 000 abbott laboratories gmbh hannover germany at ph 8 0 and 37 c for 24 h von friesen et al 2019 this method has been demonstrated to not have any harmful effects on plastic polymers von friesen et al 2019 after enzymatic treatment the filters were thoroughly rinsed with milliq water to remove the dissolved organic matter filters that did not require further treatment were placed in a petri dish until analysis while the filters which still contained excess minerogenic material were further treated in a density separation step in this step all material on the enzyme treated filters was rinsed into a 1 l glass separating funnel with saturated nai solution additional nai solution 500 ml was added to the funnel which was then shaken vigorously for several minutes to separate the rubber bitumen and microplastics from the heavier mineral particles the inner wall of the funnel was carefully rinsed with nai to wash out all the particles and the solution was left to settle until it was clear the separation was completed in 12 24 h the heavy bottom layer containing the natural mineral particles was removed by opening the valve at the bottom of the funnel the rest of the nai was poured over a 100 µm filter the funnel was rinsed several times with nai solution and each portion was poured over the filter finally the filter was rinsed with milliq and put in a petri dish prior to analyses 2 3 2 analyses of microplastic particles rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles were analyzed with stereo microscopy leica m205 c 80 160 wetzlar germany this is considered to be a reliable approach for particles 50 100 µm provided that the analysis is carried out by experienced staff as was the case in this study the examined particles were divided into five categories according to material and shape tire wear bitumen plastic fibers plastic fragments and paint particles particles originating from tire wear will hereafter be referred to as rubber particles while particles originating from bitumen will be referred to as bitumen particles plastic fibers plastic fragments and paint particles will all be included under the term other microplastic particles type and number of particles were identified by visual analyses in combination with tactile and melting tests a tweezer was used to distinguish the elastic structure of rubber particles from the tar like bitumen for further details see järlskog et al 2020 this tactile identification is also suitable to distinguish between mineral particles with their hard and impenetrable surfaces and the always much softer plastic particles plastic fibers are distinguished from non synthetic fibers cotton cellulose by the smooth surface rounded edges and stiff structure magnusson and wahlberg 2014 zubris and richards 2005 when necessary a melting test was performed to verify whether the particle or fiber melted which is characteristic of plastic more specifically the particle in question was placed on an object glass which was heated from below with an alcohol burner a detailed discussion of the methods for detecting the microplastics used in this study in comparison with other analytical methods for microplastic analyses is provided in the supplementary material 2 3 3 qa qc precautions were taken to minimize potential contamination of the samples during handling two types of blank samples were included in the analyses the first type covered the entire process from sampling to analysis of the water field blank while the second type only included the steps carried out in the laboratory laboratory blank for the field blanks during rain events 1 6 7 8 and 9 tap water was collected in similar containers as used for the stormwater samples these containers and samples were handled and analyzed the same way as the stormwater containers and samples field blank volumes varied from 8 3 to 14 l for the laboratory blanks all analytical processes from filtration enzyme treatment and density separation were carried out on tap water particles were scraped of the wall of the plastic canisters used to collect the water they were then used as reference particles during analysis to control for potential contamination of the samples from the canisters during the visual inspection of samples wetted filters exposed to the air were placed around the stereomicroscope to estimate possible contamination by airborne particles during the analysis 2 4 data analyses when no microplastic particles were found in a sample these were reported to be below a detection limit these detection limits were calculated by dividing the minimum number of plastic particles which can be found in a sample i e 1 by the volume of the sample supplementary table 1 thus the detection limit expresses the sensitivity of the microplastic analyses and vary depending on the sample volume of each sample for statistical calculations half the detection limit was used wilcoxon signed rank tests were conducted to identify statistically significant differences between components of the studied treatment train the mann whitney test was used to determine whether the vegetated and sand only filters significantly differed in terms of treatment performance furthermore the removal percentage for microplastic 1 outflow inflow 100 was calculated separately for road runoff vs gpt outflow the gpt outflow vs the vegetated filter f1 and the non vegetated filter f2 as well as for the full treatment trains road runoff vs outflow from f1 and f2 spearman s rho was calculated to determine whether any of the rain characteristics were correlated to microplastic particle concentrations in the stormwater the threshold for statistical significance was set at p 0 05 and all the statistical tests were carried out with minitab version 17 2 1 minitab state college pa 3 results 3 1 microplastic particle concentrations in the highway runoff the concentrations of rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles in the stormwater were considerably higher in the size fraction 100 300 µm than in the size fraction 300 µm rubber bitumen and other microplastics in the 100 300 µm size fraction were detected for all rain events apart from rain events 4 and 7 for which no rubber and bitumen particles were found table 2 the concentrations of these particles varied greatly between the sampled rain events e g rubber particles ranged from 0 31 to 740 particles l while bitumen particles ranged from 0 31 and 870 particles l table 2 lower overall concentrations as well as lower variation between rain events were found for other microplastic particles 0 38 6 2 particles l table 2 fig 2 the inflow concentrations of rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles in the 100 300 µm fraction were correlated with each other rubber and bitumen spearman rho 0 933 p 0 001 rubber and other microplastics spearman rho 0 667 p 0 050 bitumen and other microplastics spearman rho 0 700 p 0 036 the highest rubber and bitumen concentrations were observed for rain events 1 and 9 which also showed the highest rain peak intensities table 2 peak intensity vs rubber spearman rho 0 770 p 0 015 peak intensity vs bitumen spearman rho 0 678 p 0 045 the observed concentrations of other microplastic particles in stormwater were not correlated with the rain intensity spearman rho 0 452 p 0 222 rubber and bitumen particles 300 µm were only detected in the highway runoff for rain events 1 and 9 table 2 which were the rain events with the highest intensities table 1 other microplastic particles 300 µm were found more frequently in 6 9 rain events table 2 when detected the concentrations of microplastic particles 300 µm were far lower than those observed for the smaller fraction 100 300 µm 3 2 microplastic removal by the treatment train 3 2 1 overall performance of the treatment train overall the gpt in combination with the downstream filters efficiently removed microplastics in the 100 300 µm fraction i e all categories of microplastics showed lower median concentrations in the filter effluent than in the stormwater from the highway table 2 fig 2 however high variation between the events was observed in the outflow concentrations of microplastics table 2 fig 2 the treatment trains were mostly effective at removing rubber particles gpt f1 46 99 removal and gpt f2 77 98 removal table 3 during rain event 2 there was a net release of rubber particles from the vegetated filter removal 144 stormwater 4 6 particles l f1 9 0 particles l while rubber particles were released from the sand only filter during events 4 stormwater 0 38 particles l f2 0 38 particles l and 7 stormwater 0 31 particles l f2 0 26 particles l the removal rates observed for bitumen particles were between 80 99 gpt f1 and 25 98 gpt f2 table 3 however during rain events 2 stormwater 9 1 particles l f1 11 particles l and 7 stormwater 0 31 particles l f2 0 64 particles l bitumen particles were released from the treatment train the concentrations of other microplastic particles were mostly lower in the effluent of both filters than in the stormwater inflow table 3 removal gpt f1 between 65 and 97 gpt f2 between 13 and 94 other microplastic particles were released from the treatment trains during events 1 gpt f1 150 gpt f2 24 4 gpt f2 96 and 5 gpt f2 29 the rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles released from the system during the studied rain events may have originated from either the gpt or the filter cells or may represent previously trapped particles rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles 300 µm were present in both the untreated stormwater and the effluent at far lower concentrations than particles in the 100 300 µm fraction table 2 fig 2 rubber and bitumen particles were only detected in the inflow of the treatment train during rain events 1 and 9 for these two rain events the removal of these 300 µm particles by the stormwater treatment train was mostly effective i e removal rates ranged from 33 to 99 furthermore low concentrations of rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles 300 µm were occasionally detected in some of the gpt and filter f1 f2 samples table 2 however these concentrations were very low and single particles were detected in only few samples table 2 given the very low concentrations of these particles a general trend and conclusions for the treatment of rubber bitumen and microplastic particles 300 µm cannot be drawn 3 2 2 effect of the gross pollutant trap gpt our results suggest that a gpt alone does not efficiently remove any of the evaluated microplastic types in the two size fractions table 2 fig 2 no significant differences between particle concentrations in the stormwater samples inflow and outflow of the gpt were identified based on the wilcoxon signed rank test table 4 moreover the effluent of the gpt often contained higher concentrations of microplastics than the stormwater which indicates resuspension and release of earlier accumulated microplastic particles at some events hence variation between the removal and or release of rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles representing the 300 µm and 100 300 µm fractions between different rain events indicates that a gpt is not a reliable system for microplastic treatment table 3 3 2 3 performance of the vegetated bioretention cell and the non vegetated sand filter the concentrations of rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles between 100 and 300 µm generally decreased after passage through the vegetated bioretention cell f1 and the non vegetated sand filter f2 respectively table 2 table 3 fig 2 the removal of rubber particles in the 100 300 µm fraction from the filter inflow i e outflow gpt was between 80 99 at 5 out of 9 rains and 46 97 at 6 out of 9 rains in the f1 and f2 filters respectively while the f1 and f2 filters resulted in removal rates of 19 6 9 rains and 63 6 9 rains respectively for bitumen in the 100 300 µm fraction table 3 however the release of rubber and bitumen particles was observed in several instances rubber rain 2 f1 6 f1 f2 and 4 f2 bitumen rain 1 f2 6 f1 f2 and 7 f2 although there was a considerable degree of variation in the collected data the results of the wilcoxon signed rank test revealed that the effluent of the gpt and effluent of the vegetated filter cell f1 significantly differed in terms of concentrations of 100 300 µm big bitumen particles but not rubber particles table 4 for other microplastics between 100 and 300 µm no significant differences between the effluent of the gpt and the effluent of vegetated filter cell f1 or of the non vegetated sand filter f2 were found for 7 out of the 9 rain events the removal of other microplastic particles was between 32 and 97 for the vegetated bioretention system f1 for the non vegetated sand filter f2 only 3 events showed removals exceeding 50 for the other events removal 12 or release of other microplastics were detected table 3 microplastics 300 µm could in most cases not be quantified when microplastics 300 µm were quantified in the stormwater or after the gpt the corresponding effluent concentrations were mostly low reliable calculations of the removal rates for these particles were not possible due to the many values below detection limit however given these very low concentrations at least for the evaluated system and rains microplastic in that larger fraction was of less environmental concern in the biofilter effluent compared to the smaller fraction the vegetated f1 and non vegetated filter cells f2 did not differ significantly in terms of removal efficiency for rubber and bitumen particles in the 100 300 µm fraction mann whitney test rubber w 59 5 p 0 248 bitumen w 62 p 0 361 this indicates that the presence of vegetation did not influence the removal of rubber and bitumen particles during the treatment process for other microplastic particles the mann whitney test results revealed significantly higher effluent concentrations w 50 p 0 039 in the sand filter cell f2 relative to the vegetated filter f1 3 2 4 release of microplastic particles during overflow events the concentrations of rubber and bitumen particles measured from the surface water in the gpt that was close to the overflow pit reached considerably high values table 2 these concentrations were lower than what was measured in the stormwater but far higher than what was measured from the treated biofilter outflow table 2 other microplastic particles were present in the overflow at similar concentrations as had been determined in the stormwater table 2 in the case of an overflow the particles observed in the surface water of the gpt would bypass the system and enter the receiving waters although this data set is limited to three events the results nevertheless indicate that overflow events may considerably affect the bioretention performance concerning microplastics 4 discussion 4 1 microplastic particles in highway runoff the rubber bitumen and other microplastic particle concentrations in stormwater table 2 fig 2 presented in this study vary considerably but are generally within the range of concentrations reported in earlier studies as such the current data is representative and the findings support earlier claims that stormwater can be an important source of microplastic e g smyth et al 2021 gilbreath et al 2019 piñon colin et al 2020 and järlskog et al 2020 the studies by gilbreath et al 2019 and järlskog et al 2020 share that the research investigated a limited number of rain events 3 and 5 events respectively piñon colin et al 2020 evaluated seven rain events but used grab sampling which is insufficient for stormwater sampling and thus limits generalizability and comparability the limited number of rain events also limits the ability to draw general conclusions regarding how rain intensity and antecedent dry days influence microplastic concentrations järlskog et al 2020 did not explicitly discuss either of these characteristics in their study moreover it is difficult to compare the current findings with what has been reported in earlier research due to methodological differences between studies such as differences in sampling strategies or sampled volumes covernton et al 2019 smyth et al 2021 shruti et al 2021 nevertheless a comparison of results reveals some parallels with regards to microplastic concentrations in stormwater as was reported in the present study high variations in particle concentrations between rain events have also been observed in previous research smyth et al 2021 gilbreath et al 2019 piñon colin et al 2020 järlskog et al 2020 for example piñon colin et al 2020 found 12 to 2054 particles l 200 µm in stormwater grab samples from seven rain events taken directly from the streets of urban catchments in tijuana mexico the researchers did not specifically address tire and bitumen particles smyth et al 2021 studied microplastics in parking lot runoff at an inlet of a bioretention system in the collected samples which represented 17 distinct rain events they found up to 586 microplastic particles l median 34 particles l between 106 300 µm in size according to the researchers rubber particles accounted for only 17 of the total detected microplastic particles gilbreath et al 2019 investigated anthropogenic microparticles including glass beads and asphalt fragments in runoff from an urban catchment across three separate rain events and detected up to 315 particles 100 l that were 125 µm in size mean 160 particles 100 l the combined data indicated that rubber fragments only account for 4 of the anthropogenic microparticles identified from the runoff moreover järlskog et al 2020 reported higher concentrations of plastic and paint particles than tire bitumen wear particles 100 µm based on analyses of flow proportional composite samples from an urban catchment in gothenburg sweden n 5 in contrast to what has been reported earlier e g smyth et al 2021 gilbreath et al 2019 and järlskog et al 2020 we found that rubber and bitumen particles were the dominating microplastic groups and that their concentrations exceeded the concentrations of other microplastics in stormwater table 2 this discrepancy may be explained by differences between catchments more specifically smyth et al 2021 sampled runoff from a parking lot in a recreational area while gilbreath et al 2019 and järlskog et al 2020 sampled urban catchments representing a variety of different land uses while this study investigated motorway runoff all these catchments were undoubtedly influenced by human activity i e human behavior synthetic clothes shoes and backpacks along with the consumption of synthetic food packages may have contributed to higher levels of fibers than what was measured in the current study of highway runoff furthermore tire wear abundance on a street is related among other factors to velocity e g kole et al 2017 which will be higher on the highway evaluated in this study than in car parks and or inner urban streets in their evaluation of 17 rain events smyth et al 2021 found that rainfall intensity was correlated with the amount of microplastic particles excluding microfibers in the sampled stormwater the results of the present study provide support for this relationship as rain peak intensity was positively correlated to the concentrations of rubber and bitumen see tables 1 and 2 rain events 1 and 9 in stormwater the correlation between peak intensity and other microplastic particles was not so distinct many of the compounds included in the other microplastic particles class likely have a lower density 1 g cm3 kooi and koelmans 2019 than that of the rubber and bitumen particles which can be higher inter alia due mineral or metal encrustations in these particles 1 8 g cm3 according to unice et al 2019 for this reason it is likely that other microplastic particles are more readily washed off from surfaces than rubber bitumen particles even during rain events with lower peak intensity the high rubber and bitumen particle concentrations measured in rain event 9 table 2 were most likely due to the high inflow velocity v 0 9 m s during this event which could have resuspended previously accumulated material in the storm sewer between the road and the gpt inlet in this study the microplastic particles identified from the stormwater were found in the 100 300 µm size fraction more often than in the 300 µm size fraction in which far lower concentrations were detected this in line with similar observations in previous studies covernton et al 2019 smyth et al 2021 explanations for this might either be that the road traffic generates fewer particles in this size range and or that a larger fraction of these larger particles are permanently deposited closer to the road the latter explanation is supported by the fact that there were higher concentrations of the lighter microplastic particles 300 µm which are more easily transported with road runoff than the heavier rubber and bitumen particles however this remains speculative and further research on microplastic pathways from road surfaces is required to shed light on this issue 4 2 effect of the treatment train on microplastic particle concentrations and removal the results of this study suggest that rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles between 100 and 300 µm in size can be retained by the treatment train particularly by the bioretention system only a limited amount of rubber and bitumen particles 300 µm were observed in this study and thus statements regarding the treatment of these particles cannot be made other microplastic particles 300 µm were more abundant than rubber and bitumen particles in that size range with the data indicating that these compounds were relatively efficiently removed by the treatment train as was the case for rubber and bitumen particles 300 µm other microplastic particles occurred in higher concentrations in the 100 300 µm fraction than in the 300 µm fraction this is consistent with previous research i e the concentrations of microplastic particles tend to increase with decreasing filter mesh size covernton et al 2019 smyth et al 2021 the presented findings demonstrate that the biofilter and sand filters were responsible for the observed removal of microplastic particles the gpt did not effectively remove rubber bitumen or other microplastic particles in either of the evaluated size fractions this is in line with the results of klöckner et al 2019 who only investigated one rain event at a stormwater treatment train consisting of a sedimentation basin and soil retention filter their samples were analyzed for tire and road wear particles by analyzing the zn content of the light fractions 1 9 g cm³ although there is no consensus in the literature that zn content is a good proxy for tire wear the results indicate that concentrations of tire and road wear particles slightly increased from the sedimentation basin 0 57 0 07 mg zn g to the closest sampling point at the soil retention filter 0 65 0 13 mg zn g similarly numerous other studies have indicated that sedimentation ponds are inefficient means for the removal of microplastic particles excluding tire wear and bitumen particles liu et al 2019 2019 olesen et al 2019 the most likely reason that gpts are ineffective at removing these microplastic particles is the relatively low density of rubber halle et al 2020 bitumen unice et al 2019 and other microplastic particles kooi and koelmans 2019 which may translate to low sedimentation rates the hypothesis that bioretention systems can retain microplastics was confirmed by the results for particles in the 100 300 µm size fraction likely the filters also remove microplastics in the larger fraction efficiently however to prove that further studies with larger sample volumes would be required to enable quantification of the compared to the 100 300 µm fraction low concentrations in the 300 µm fraction to date only two studies have investigated the treatment of microplastics in bioretention systems in a study of anthropogenic microparticles including rubber paint plastic and asphalt fragments and fibers among others in the in and outflow of a bioretention system gilbreath et al 2019 found that particles were retained well across all three observed rain events with removal efficiencies of 55 125 355 µm fraction 81 355 500 µm fraction and 100 500 µm furthermore smyth et al 2021 showed that a bioretention system can reduce the concentrations of microplastic particles between 106 300 µm in size by 63 as suggested by smyth et al 2021 the process underlying effective microplastic removal is most likely filtration the presented results provide evidence that both the vegetated biofilter and the sand filter were generally able to efficiently remove microplastic particles while rubber and bitumen were removed equally well by both filter cells the vegetated filter was statistically significantly better at removing other microplastic particles however the difference between the effluents from the vegetated and sand only filters 0 33 particles l and 0 86 particles l respectively likely has no or only little practical significance as such a general statement that bioretention systems with plants are preferable to sand only filters for the treatment of microplastics cannot be made based on this study although the presented results as well as findings from two other studies gilbreath et al 2019 smyth et al 2021 suggest that bioretention systems effectively retain microplastic 100 300 µm further research in diverse catchments is needed to corroborate these claims moreover future studies should include the size fractions not analysed in this study smaller particle sizes i e 100 µm are highly relevant because for example tire wear particles are often 100 µm wagner et al 2018 or even 100 nm in size kukutschová et al 2011 which have not been evaluated for stormwater bioretention furthermore microplastic particles captured in bioretention systems may degrade over time due to weathering processes unice et al 2019 and thus become finer and or more mobile o connor et al 2019 this justifies the need to also analyze larger particles there is previous evidence that bioretention systems are effective at removing particles tss particulate metals down to 0 45 µm in size davis et al 2009 however other studies have shown that environmental conditions such as dry periods can negatively affect the performance of bioretention systems towards tss 1 2 µm and particulate metals 0 45 µm blecken et al 2009 lange et al 2020 moreover o connor et al 2019 found that the penetration depth of polyethylene particles in soil columns may be influenced by wet dry cycles thus it is plausible that environmental conditions e g extended dry periods affect how readily microplastic particles 0 45 µm penetrate the filter material o connor et al 2019 found that specifically the mobility of particles with higher densities may be increased by wet dry cycles that could be relevant for rubber and bitumen particles which are encrusted with minerals unice et al 2019 despite efficient microplastic removal microplastic concentrations in the effluent of the bioretention systems varied between 0 26 and 0 87 particles l depending on the presence of vegetation on the filter and the type of microplastic these concentrations are still 1000 fold higher than concentrations measured from the baltic sea e g 0 21 0 15 particles m3 plankton sample 100 µm beer et al 2018 further the accumulation of traffic related microplastics in bioretention systems could lead to lethal concentrations of toxic substances in receiving waters as tian et al 2021 discovered that 6ppd n 1 3 dimethylbutyl n phenyl p phenylenediamine quinone which originates from tire wear particles contributes to mortality in a pacific salmon species based on these findings the researchers emphasized that evaluations of stormwater pollutants cannot solely focus on the previously defined priority substances but also assess how other compounds can impact the surrounding environment this claim needs to be integrated into future research concerning how effective bioretention systems are at removing microplastic particles the high concentrations of rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles in the surface water of the gpt close to the overflow pit table 2 indicate that particles suspended in the top layer miller et al 2021 may be released into receiving waters during overflow events the environmental impact of this type of situation depends on the design of the bioretention facility which determines the frequency of overflows the presented results indicate that other microplastic particles relatively low density are most likely to be released with overflowing surface water followed by rubber and bitumen particles in the 100 300 µm fraction this dynamic is predominantly linked to the increasing densities of the materials microplastic particles very variable 1 g cm³ according to kooi and koelmans 2019 rubber 1 15 and 1 20 g cm3 according to halle et al 2020 bitumen 1 8 g cm³ according to unice et al 2019 thus the overflow pits of catchments with a particularly high fraction of lighter microplastic particles relative to rubber and bitumen particles smyth et al 2021 gilbreath et al 2019 could impair the treatment performance of bioretention systems similar to other pollutants in stormwater in this study the overflow pit was located in the gpt i e it was not in direct contact with the filter in other designs the overflow pit is commonly placed within the bioretention filter bed this could involve a risk for the release of low density microplastics which had accumulated on top of the filter surface however this remains a speculative hypothesis with further studies needed to evaluate that risk associated with overflow pits along with their specific location 5 conclusion the results of this study on microplastic treatment in a bioretention system equipped with a gross pollutant trap suggest that stormwater from highway catchments can contain high but varying concentrations of rubber 740 to 0 31 particles l and bitumen 870 to 0 31 particles l particles between 100 300 µm in size rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles 300 µm occurred in far lower concentrations and were not quantified frequently 19 to 0 07 3 1 to 0 07 and 0 69 to 0 24 particles l respectively the gross pollutant trap did not provide effective treatment of rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles between 100 300 µm in size bioretention systems however did show sufficient treatment performance often with high removal percentages exceeding 70 thus providing an overall sufficient performance of the treatment train lower removals or leaching were only observed in some occasions both the vegetated and non vegetated filter cells demonstrated effective treatment of the studied microplastics for both filters removal percentages exceeded mostly 70 except for the removal of other microplastic particles by the non vegetated filter which was lower excessive water inflows i e those which surpass the designed capacity of the treatment train may contribute to the discharge of rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles to receiving waters further studies should include evaluation of the removal of microplastic fractions 100 µm removal efficiencies and pathways of microplastic fractions 300 µm integrate environmental factors such as dry wet periods and investigate the fates of potential microplastic leachates declaration of

threats to the environment this study investigated how effective a stormwater treatment train was at removing rubber bitumen and other microplastics incl fibers fragments and paint particles in the 100 300 µm and 300 µm size fractions from highway runoff the two treatment trains comprise a gross pollutant trap gpt followed by either a vegetated bioretention cell or non vegetated sand filter flow proportional composite samples were taken from the highway runoff gpt outflow and the outflow from the two parallel filters during nine rain events to determine overall treatment performance as well as the performance of individual system components the identified rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles mainly represented the 100 300 µm fraction and included high ratios of rubber 30 and bitumen 60 overall the treatment train efficiently removed rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles in the 100 300 µm size fraction from the stormwater the filter cells accounted for a major share of this removal as the gpt did not reduce microplastic particle concentrations this observation is likely explained by the fact that the rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles have a density close to the density of water and thus removal by sedimentation is decreased this identified an inherent weakness of the system more specifically the high microplastic concentrations in the surface water of the gpt means there can be a risk of microplastic release through overflow pits when inflows surpass the system capacity despite some differences both the vegetated bioretention cell and the non vegetated sand filter removed rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles to similar extent graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stormwater biofilter pre sedimentation microplastic tyre wear bitumen microlitter 1 introduction microplastics can cause damage to both terrestrial and aquatic environments e g wagner et al 2018 and tian et al 2021 in addition to atmospheric deposition and industrial and household wastewater stormwater especially road runoff has been identified as a means through which microplastics entering the receiving water environment e g kole et al 2017 unice et al 2019 and halle et al 2020 important sources of microplastic are tire wear brake wear road wear and road paint wagner et al 2018 vijayan et al 2019 järlskog et al 2020 in the following tire wear bitumen plastic fibres plastic fragments and paint particles are grouped under the term microplastics which is in accordance with e g hartmann et al 2019 and järlskog et al 2020 tire wear and bitumen particles are not considered as plastics from a material science perspective but commonly included into the microplastic definition used in environmental sciences since they descend from manmade synthetic products of environmental concern hartmann et al 2019 järlskog et al 2020 despite the relevance of microplastic pollution from stormwater there is scarce empirical evidence regarding microplastics treatment in stormwater control measures ziajahromi et al 2020 studied microplastic occurrence in water and sediment from a floating treatment wetland interestingly they detected higher particle concentrations in the effluent than in the influent the identified particles also included certain black particles suspected to derive from car tires however their origin could not be confirmed it has been suggested that the microplastics in urban and highway runoff may be partly removed by sedimentation ponds but may require further treatment due to the presence of these particles in the water phase of treatment ponds liu et al 2019 2019 olesen et al 2019 however these studies investigated neither the treatment performances of the ponds nor analyzed specifically traffic related microplastics i e black particles from tire wear and bitumen klöckner et al 2019 sampled road runoff from a soil retention filter including pre sedimentation with the aim of developing an analytical method for traffic related microplastic although the treatment performance was not investigated the presented data imply that sedimentation processes alone may be insufficient to sufficiently remove microplastics which commonly have relatively low densities unice et al 2019 klöckner et al 2019 kooi and koelmans 2019 polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp particles will tend to float while heavier particles e g polystyrene ps or poly methyl 2 methylpropenoate pmma particles might settle but then easily be resuspended at subsequent storm events in summary these studies suggest that sedimentation only is insufficient for microplastics removal and further treatment steps are required stormwater bioretention systems which often include a pre sedimentation step e g forebay or gross pollutant trap gpt can be a suitable alternative for the treatment of microplastics bioretention systems effectively remove particulate stormwater contaminants e g suspended solids particulate metals particle associated pahs via filtration through a filter material e g davis et al 2009 however only two studies describe the microplastics treatment performance of bioretention notably gilbreath et al 2019 studied the effectiveness of an urban rain garden for microplastic treatment and suggest based on data covering three rain events only that bioretention systems could effectively treat microplastic particles 125 µm in addition smyth et al 2021 demonstrated that a bioretention cell at a parking lot was generally effective for removing microplastic particles 106 µm most bioretention systems have a limited stormwater capture capacity defined as the fraction of stormwater captured and filtered by the system when the system is exposed to high flows excess water is bypassed the filter via overflow pits zhang and guo 2014 this could affect the overall treatment of microplastic particles which commonly have lower densities than for instance mineral particles and subsequently show slower sedimentation rates klöckner et al 2019 unice et al 2019 thus particles either suspended in the stormwater or re suspended after having previously accumulated on top of the filter may be released when overflow occurs it should be noted that this potential risk was not discussed by either smyth et al 2021 or gilbreath et al 2019 no study has yet evaluated microplastic removal in bioretention systems equipped with a pre sedimentation forebay or gpt however we assume that pre sedimentation would not significantly affect the overall removal given that sedimentation is likely not sufficient to efficiently remove microplastics particularly not those composed of low density polymers klöckner et al 2019 in addition the pre sedimentation section prior to bioretention systems is of relatively small size compared to e g a stormwater pond furthermore both aforementioned bioretention studies gilbreath et al 2019 smyth et al 2021 investigated runoff from catchments with relatively little traffic as such using bioretention systems to remove microplastics from road runoff in areas with high traffic loads and thus probably higher microplastic concentrations has not yet been evaluated like vegetated bioretention non vegetated gravel sand filters have a high potential to remove total suspended solids tss and particle bound other pollutants zarezadeh et al 2018 and thus should also be applicable for microplastic removal however the treatment of microplastics in bioretention systems could be affected by inter alia vegetation as has previously been observed for tss and particulate metals lange et al 2020 hence the comparison of vegetated and unvegetated systems would shed light on how vegetation influences the treatment performance and which treatment potential stormwater sand gravel filters have in summary only two studies gilbreath et al 2019 smyth et al 2021 have described microplastics removal by bioretention which limits the generalizability of the results furthermore one of the studies only investigated three events and neither of them evaluates the role of overflow runoff from highly trafficked roads the influence of vegetation in bioretention or the effect of a pre sedimentation step this study aimed to investigate traffic related microplastic particle concentrations in highway runoff and to determine whether a stormwater treatment train consisting of a pre sedimentation gpt with an overflow pit in combination with either i a vegetated bioretention system or ii an unvegetated sand filter fig 1 can remove these microplastics measurements were carried out in a way that the contribution of all components of the treatment train could be evaluated separately the research included the following hypotheses i the filters rather than the gpt will reduce the concentrations of microplastic particles in stormwater and ii the sand filter and vegetated bioretention system will show comparable performance in the removal of these particles 2 methods 2 1 site description the stormwater treatment train located in sundsvall on sweden s baltic sea coast 62 23 0 5 n 17 20 50 5 e experiences seasonal changes with relatively mild summers and cold winters yearly mean temperature 5 2 c warmest month july 16 9 c coldest month january 4 9 c the treatment facility receives runoff from a total impervious catchment area of 4 7 ha including 1 9 ha of motorway bridge e4 with average traffic of 13 250 vehicles day in 2019 and a motorway exit the stormwater treatment train consists of a gpt connected to either a subsequent vertical flow bioretention system or a non vegetated sand filter system the gpt has a volume of 47 m3 and consists of a sedimentation chamber where the overflow weir of the system is located and a compartment for oil separation the stormwater enters the gpt through a horizontal submerged pipe i e pipe top below water level the evaluated sections of the subsequent filter system have a total surface area of 470 m2 and consist of one vegetated bioretention cell and one non vegetated sand filter cell these filter cells are divided by a subsurface membrane made of ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm rubber such a membrane could be a potential source of microplastics however plastic degradation below the soil surface is considered generally as low bläsing and amelung 2018 the presence of separate underdrains means that the effluent can be sampled separately from each cell a third cell visible in fig 1 was not included in this study the bioretention system was designed according to recommendations of the german association for water wastewater and waste dwa dwa 2005 and consists of 0 5 m deep sand based material mass median diameter d50 0 77 uniformity coefficient cu 0 27 during a rain event the water spreads evenly over the filter cells and rises to a maximum height of one meter in the case that the rain event exceeds the design capacity the stormwater bypasses over the overflow weir in the gpt and is discharged untreated to the receiving water at the start of the sampling the stormwater treatment train had been in operation for one year and four months 2 2 experimental setup and sampling volume proportional composite water samples were taken during nine rain events with varying characteristics table 1 in autumn 2019 and spring summer 2020 using automatic samplers isco6712 and 25 l white hdpe water canisters particles of the canisters were not detected in any of the samples to reliably assess the treatment performance of the biofilters it would have been desirable to include samples representing more than nine rain events however when compared to previous studies that examined removal of microplastics and other pollutants by stormwater bioretention systems the nine rain events in this study are in a common range smyth et al 2021 12 events gilbreath et al 2019 3 events chen et al 2013 10 events järlskog et al 2020 and piñon colin et al 2020 evaluated five and seven rain events respectively the sampled storm events in this study cover rains with different characteristics intensities varying between 0 9 and 8 8 mm h and rain depths between 6 2 and 23 6 mm and are thus representing a wide variety of events rain events less than 5 mm could not be included in the study since they did not generate sufficient runoff to the treatment facility since the rain volumes could not be predicted with absolute accuracy sample volumes varied from 1 8 to 20 l such variations are unavoidable when collecting flow proportional samples since neither precipitation nor filter outflow can be predicted exactly in advance when programming the automatic sampler an impact of the varying volumes on the results is not expected the flow proportional composite samples account for the variability during each rain events the samples were taken at five points fig 1 from the stormwater inflow abbreviated sw the outflow after treatment in the gpt which is equal to the filter inflow abbreviated gpt the outflow from the vegetated bioretention cell abbreviated f1 and the outflow from the non vegetated filter cell abbreviated f2 furthermore during rain events 1 2 and 9 grab samples were taken from the surface water 0 5 cm of the sedimentation compartment that was close to the overflow pit op this was done to estimate the potential release of microplastic from the overflow pit no overflow occurred during rain event 2 due to relatively low flows but an op sample was nevertheless taken rain data were obtained from a tipping bucket rain gauge isco 674 installed at a height of 2 5 m at the sampling site fig 1 for the last rain event 9 data were obtained from a weather station ca 0 2 km from the sampling site due to malfunctioning of this rain gauge the gpt outflow was steered by valves which opened when the water level in the chamber reached a maximum level after discharging a certain volume to the filter the valves close again these pulses were logged and used to trigger the sw and gpt samplers as well as to calculate stormwater inflow and outflow from the gpt outflow data for f1 and f2 were obtained from in pipe electromagnetic flowmeters installed in the outflow pipes of the bioretention systems the outflow samplers were triggered by these flowmeters rain and flow data for the nine events are summarized in table 1 antecedent dry days adds describe the days since the last rain event above 0 5 mm 24 h 2 3 microplastic analyses 2 3 1 processing of the water samples the canisters containing the stormwater were shaken to bring settled particulate matter into suspension next all the water was filtered in sequence over clean nylon filters mesh sizes 300 and 100 µm which were fitted in a stainless steel filter holder no vacuum suction was used a diameter of 5 mm was chosen as the upper microplastic particle size boundary based on recommendations from the un joint group of scientific experts of marine environmental protection gesamp 2019 the filters were then put in individual petri dishes filters with little organic and minerogenic material were analyzed without any pretreatment whereas filters in which the amount of such material hampered analysis were first treated with enzymes to remove organic matter other than the microplastic particles and if necessary density separated with a saturated solution of nai 1 85 g cm 3 to separate the lighter microplastic particles from the heavier mineral particles järlskog et al 2020 these treatments were required for some of the 100 µm filters the enzymatic treatment included treating the filters with pancreatic enzymes creon 40 000 abbott laboratories gmbh hannover germany at ph 8 0 and 37 c for 24 h von friesen et al 2019 this method has been demonstrated to not have any harmful effects on plastic polymers von friesen et al 2019 after enzymatic treatment the filters were thoroughly rinsed with milliq water to remove the dissolved organic matter filters that did not require further treatment were placed in a petri dish until analysis while the filters which still contained excess minerogenic material were further treated in a density separation step in this step all material on the enzyme treated filters was rinsed into a 1 l glass separating funnel with saturated nai solution additional nai solution 500 ml was added to the funnel which was then shaken vigorously for several minutes to separate the rubber bitumen and microplastics from the heavier mineral particles the inner wall of the funnel was carefully rinsed with nai to wash out all the particles and the solution was left to settle until it was clear the separation was completed in 12 24 h the heavy bottom layer containing the natural mineral particles was removed by opening the valve at the bottom of the funnel the rest of the nai was poured over a 100 µm filter the funnel was rinsed several times with nai solution and each portion was poured over the filter finally the filter was rinsed with milliq and put in a petri dish prior to analyses 2 3 2 analyses of microplastic particles rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles were analyzed with stereo microscopy leica m205 c 80 160 wetzlar germany this is considered to be a reliable approach for particles 50 100 µm provided that the analysis is carried out by experienced staff as was the case in this study the examined particles were divided into five categories according to material and shape tire wear bitumen plastic fibers plastic fragments and paint particles particles originating from tire wear will hereafter be referred to as rubber particles while particles originating from bitumen will be referred to as bitumen particles plastic fibers plastic fragments and paint particles will all be included under the term other microplastic particles type and number of particles were identified by visual analyses in combination with tactile and melting tests a tweezer was used to distinguish the elastic structure of rubber particles from the tar like bitumen for further details see järlskog et al 2020 this tactile identification is also suitable to distinguish between mineral particles with their hard and impenetrable surfaces and the always much softer plastic particles plastic fibers are distinguished from non synthetic fibers cotton cellulose by the smooth surface rounded edges and stiff structure magnusson and wahlberg 2014 zubris and richards 2005 when necessary a melting test was performed to verify whether the particle or fiber melted which is characteristic of plastic more specifically the particle in question was placed on an object glass which was heated from below with an alcohol burner a detailed discussion of the methods for detecting the microplastics used in this study in comparison with other analytical methods for microplastic analyses is provided in the supplementary material 2 3 3 qa qc precautions were taken to minimize potential contamination of the samples during handling two types of blank samples were included in the analyses the first type covered the entire process from sampling to analysis of the water field blank while the second type only included the steps carried out in the laboratory laboratory blank for the field blanks during rain events 1 6 7 8 and 9 tap water was collected in similar containers as used for the stormwater samples these containers and samples were handled and analyzed the same way as the stormwater containers and samples field blank volumes varied from 8 3 to 14 l for the laboratory blanks all analytical processes from filtration enzyme treatment and density separation were carried out on tap water particles were scraped of the wall of the plastic canisters used to collect the water they were then used as reference particles during analysis to control for potential contamination of the samples from the canisters during the visual inspection of samples wetted filters exposed to the air were placed around the stereomicroscope to estimate possible contamination by airborne particles during the analysis 2 4 data analyses when no microplastic particles were found in a sample these were reported to be below a detection limit these detection limits were calculated by dividing the minimum number of plastic particles which can be found in a sample i e 1 by the volume of the sample supplementary table 1 thus the detection limit expresses the sensitivity of the microplastic analyses and vary depending on the sample volume of each sample for statistical calculations half the detection limit was used wilcoxon signed rank tests were conducted to identify statistically significant differences between components of the studied treatment train the mann whitney test was used to determine whether the vegetated and sand only filters significantly differed in terms of treatment performance furthermore the removal percentage for microplastic 1 outflow inflow 100 was calculated separately for road runoff vs gpt outflow the gpt outflow vs the vegetated filter f1 and the non vegetated filter f2 as well as for the full treatment trains road runoff vs outflow from f1 and f2 spearman s rho was calculated to determine whether any of the rain characteristics were correlated to microplastic particle concentrations in the stormwater the threshold for statistical significance was set at p 0 05 and all the statistical tests were carried out with minitab version 17 2 1 minitab state college pa 3 results 3 1 microplastic particle concentrations in the highway runoff the concentrations of rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles in the stormwater were considerably higher in the size fraction 100 300 µm than in the size fraction 300 µm rubber bitumen and other microplastics in the 100 300 µm size fraction were detected for all rain events apart from rain events 4 and 7 for which no rubber and bitumen particles were found table 2 the concentrations of these particles varied greatly between the sampled rain events e g rubber particles ranged from 0 31 to 740 particles l while bitumen particles ranged from 0 31 and 870 particles l table 2 lower overall concentrations as well as lower variation between rain events were found for other microplastic particles 0 38 6 2 particles l table 2 fig 2 the inflow concentrations of rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles in the 100 300 µm fraction were correlated with each other rubber and bitumen spearman rho 0 933 p 0 001 rubber and other microplastics spearman rho 0 667 p 0 050 bitumen and other microplastics spearman rho 0 700 p 0 036 the highest rubber and bitumen concentrations were observed for rain events 1 and 9 which also showed the highest rain peak intensities table 2 peak intensity vs rubber spearman rho 0 770 p 0 015 peak intensity vs bitumen spearman rho 0 678 p 0 045 the observed concentrations of other microplastic particles in stormwater were not correlated with the rain intensity spearman rho 0 452 p 0 222 rubber and bitumen particles 300 µm were only detected in the highway runoff for rain events 1 and 9 table 2 which were the rain events with the highest intensities table 1 other microplastic particles 300 µm were found more frequently in 6 9 rain events table 2 when detected the concentrations of microplastic particles 300 µm were far lower than those observed for the smaller fraction 100 300 µm 3 2 microplastic removal by the treatment train 3 2 1 overall performance of the treatment train overall the gpt in combination with the downstream filters efficiently removed microplastics in the 100 300 µm fraction i e all categories of microplastics showed lower median concentrations in the filter effluent than in the stormwater from the highway table 2 fig 2 however high variation between the events was observed in the outflow concentrations of microplastics table 2 fig 2 the treatment trains were mostly effective at removing rubber particles gpt f1 46 99 removal and gpt f2 77 98 removal table 3 during rain event 2 there was a net release of rubber particles from the vegetated filter removal 144 stormwater 4 6 particles l f1 9 0 particles l while rubber particles were released from the sand only filter during events 4 stormwater 0 38 particles l f2 0 38 particles l and 7 stormwater 0 31 particles l f2 0 26 particles l the removal rates observed for bitumen particles were between 80 99 gpt f1 and 25 98 gpt f2 table 3 however during rain events 2 stormwater 9 1 particles l f1 11 particles l and 7 stormwater 0 31 particles l f2 0 64 particles l bitumen particles were released from the treatment train the concentrations of other microplastic particles were mostly lower in the effluent of both filters than in the stormwater inflow table 3 removal gpt f1 between 65 and 97 gpt f2 between 13 and 94 other microplastic particles were released from the treatment trains during events 1 gpt f1 150 gpt f2 24 4 gpt f2 96 and 5 gpt f2 29 the rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles released from the system during the studied rain events may have originated from either the gpt or the filter cells or may represent previously trapped particles rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles 300 µm were present in both the untreated stormwater and the effluent at far lower concentrations than particles in the 100 300 µm fraction table 2 fig 2 rubber and bitumen particles were only detected in the inflow of the treatment train during rain events 1 and 9 for these two rain events the removal of these 300 µm particles by the stormwater treatment train was mostly effective i e removal rates ranged from 33 to 99 furthermore low concentrations of rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles 300 µm were occasionally detected in some of the gpt and filter f1 f2 samples table 2 however these concentrations were very low and single particles were detected in only few samples table 2 given the very low concentrations of these particles a general trend and conclusions for the treatment of rubber bitumen and microplastic particles 300 µm cannot be drawn 3 2 2 effect of the gross pollutant trap gpt our results suggest that a gpt alone does not efficiently remove any of the evaluated microplastic types in the two size fractions table 2 fig 2 no significant differences between particle concentrations in the stormwater samples inflow and outflow of the gpt were identified based on the wilcoxon signed rank test table 4 moreover the effluent of the gpt often contained higher concentrations of microplastics than the stormwater which indicates resuspension and release of earlier accumulated microplastic particles at some events hence variation between the removal and or release of rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles representing the 300 µm and 100 300 µm fractions between different rain events indicates that a gpt is not a reliable system for microplastic treatment table 3 3 2 3 performance of the vegetated bioretention cell and the non vegetated sand filter the concentrations of rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles between 100 and 300 µm generally decreased after passage through the vegetated bioretention cell f1 and the non vegetated sand filter f2 respectively table 2 table 3 fig 2 the removal of rubber particles in the 100 300 µm fraction from the filter inflow i e outflow gpt was between 80 99 at 5 out of 9 rains and 46 97 at 6 out of 9 rains in the f1 and f2 filters respectively while the f1 and f2 filters resulted in removal rates of 19 6 9 rains and 63 6 9 rains respectively for bitumen in the 100 300 µm fraction table 3 however the release of rubber and bitumen particles was observed in several instances rubber rain 2 f1 6 f1 f2 and 4 f2 bitumen rain 1 f2 6 f1 f2 and 7 f2 although there was a considerable degree of variation in the collected data the results of the wilcoxon signed rank test revealed that the effluent of the gpt and effluent of the vegetated filter cell f1 significantly differed in terms of concentrations of 100 300 µm big bitumen particles but not rubber particles table 4 for other microplastics between 100 and 300 µm no significant differences between the effluent of the gpt and the effluent of vegetated filter cell f1 or of the non vegetated sand filter f2 were found for 7 out of the 9 rain events the removal of other microplastic particles was between 32 and 97 for the vegetated bioretention system f1 for the non vegetated sand filter f2 only 3 events showed removals exceeding 50 for the other events removal 12 or release of other microplastics were detected table 3 microplastics 300 µm could in most cases not be quantified when microplastics 300 µm were quantified in the stormwater or after the gpt the corresponding effluent concentrations were mostly low reliable calculations of the removal rates for these particles were not possible due to the many values below detection limit however given these very low concentrations at least for the evaluated system and rains microplastic in that larger fraction was of less environmental concern in the biofilter effluent compared to the smaller fraction the vegetated f1 and non vegetated filter cells f2 did not differ significantly in terms of removal efficiency for rubber and bitumen particles in the 100 300 µm fraction mann whitney test rubber w 59 5 p 0 248 bitumen w 62 p 0 361 this indicates that the presence of vegetation did not influence the removal of rubber and bitumen particles during the treatment process for other microplastic particles the mann whitney test results revealed significantly higher effluent concentrations w 50 p 0 039 in the sand filter cell f2 relative to the vegetated filter f1 3 2 4 release of microplastic particles during overflow events the concentrations of rubber and bitumen particles measured from the surface water in the gpt that was close to the overflow pit reached considerably high values table 2 these concentrations were lower than what was measured in the stormwater but far higher than what was measured from the treated biofilter outflow table 2 other microplastic particles were present in the overflow at similar concentrations as had been determined in the stormwater table 2 in the case of an overflow the particles observed in the surface water of the gpt would bypass the system and enter the receiving waters although this data set is limited to three events the results nevertheless indicate that overflow events may considerably affect the bioretention performance concerning microplastics 4 discussion 4 1 microplastic particles in highway runoff the rubber bitumen and other microplastic particle concentrations in stormwater table 2 fig 2 presented in this study vary considerably but are generally within the range of concentrations reported in earlier studies as such the current data is representative and the findings support earlier claims that stormwater can be an important source of microplastic e g smyth et al 2021 gilbreath et al 2019 piñon colin et al 2020 and järlskog et al 2020 the studies by gilbreath et al 2019 and järlskog et al 2020 share that the research investigated a limited number of rain events 3 and 5 events respectively piñon colin et al 2020 evaluated seven rain events but used grab sampling which is insufficient for stormwater sampling and thus limits generalizability and comparability the limited number of rain events also limits the ability to draw general conclusions regarding how rain intensity and antecedent dry days influence microplastic concentrations järlskog et al 2020 did not explicitly discuss either of these characteristics in their study moreover it is difficult to compare the current findings with what has been reported in earlier research due to methodological differences between studies such as differences in sampling strategies or sampled volumes covernton et al 2019 smyth et al 2021 shruti et al 2021 nevertheless a comparison of results reveals some parallels with regards to microplastic concentrations in stormwater as was reported in the present study high variations in particle concentrations between rain events have also been observed in previous research smyth et al 2021 gilbreath et al 2019 piñon colin et al 2020 järlskog et al 2020 for example piñon colin et al 2020 found 12 to 2054 particles l 200 µm in stormwater grab samples from seven rain events taken directly from the streets of urban catchments in tijuana mexico the researchers did not specifically address tire and bitumen particles smyth et al 2021 studied microplastics in parking lot runoff at an inlet of a bioretention system in the collected samples which represented 17 distinct rain events they found up to 586 microplastic particles l median 34 particles l between 106 300 µm in size according to the researchers rubber particles accounted for only 17 of the total detected microplastic particles gilbreath et al 2019 investigated anthropogenic microparticles including glass beads and asphalt fragments in runoff from an urban catchment across three separate rain events and detected up to 315 particles 100 l that were 125 µm in size mean 160 particles 100 l the combined data indicated that rubber fragments only account for 4 of the anthropogenic microparticles identified from the runoff moreover järlskog et al 2020 reported higher concentrations of plastic and paint particles than tire bitumen wear particles 100 µm based on analyses of flow proportional composite samples from an urban catchment in gothenburg sweden n 5 in contrast to what has been reported earlier e g smyth et al 2021 gilbreath et al 2019 and järlskog et al 2020 we found that rubber and bitumen particles were the dominating microplastic groups and that their concentrations exceeded the concentrations of other microplastics in stormwater table 2 this discrepancy may be explained by differences between catchments more specifically smyth et al 2021 sampled runoff from a parking lot in a recreational area while gilbreath et al 2019 and järlskog et al 2020 sampled urban catchments representing a variety of different land uses while this study investigated motorway runoff all these catchments were undoubtedly influenced by human activity i e human behavior synthetic clothes shoes and backpacks along with the consumption of synthetic food packages may have contributed to higher levels of fibers than what was measured in the current study of highway runoff furthermore tire wear abundance on a street is related among other factors to velocity e g kole et al 2017 which will be higher on the highway evaluated in this study than in car parks and or inner urban streets in their evaluation of 17 rain events smyth et al 2021 found that rainfall intensity was correlated with the amount of microplastic particles excluding microfibers in the sampled stormwater the results of the present study provide support for this relationship as rain peak intensity was positively correlated to the concentrations of rubber and bitumen see tables 1 and 2 rain events 1 and 9 in stormwater the correlation between peak intensity and other microplastic particles was not so distinct many of the compounds included in the other microplastic particles class likely have a lower density 1 g cm3 kooi and koelmans 2019 than that of the rubber and bitumen particles which can be higher inter alia due mineral or metal encrustations in these particles 1 8 g cm3 according to unice et al 2019 for this reason it is likely that other microplastic particles are more readily washed off from surfaces than rubber bitumen particles even during rain events with lower peak intensity the high rubber and bitumen particle concentrations measured in rain event 9 table 2 were most likely due to the high inflow velocity v 0 9 m s during this event which could have resuspended previously accumulated material in the storm sewer between the road and the gpt inlet in this study the microplastic particles identified from the stormwater were found in the 100 300 µm size fraction more often than in the 300 µm size fraction in which far lower concentrations were detected this in line with similar observations in previous studies covernton et al 2019 smyth et al 2021 explanations for this might either be that the road traffic generates fewer particles in this size range and or that a larger fraction of these larger particles are permanently deposited closer to the road the latter explanation is supported by the fact that there were higher concentrations of the lighter microplastic particles 300 µm which are more easily transported with road runoff than the heavier rubber and bitumen particles however this remains speculative and further research on microplastic pathways from road surfaces is required to shed light on this issue 4 2 effect of the treatment train on microplastic particle concentrations and removal the results of this study suggest that rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles between 100 and 300 µm in size can be retained by the treatment train particularly by the bioretention system only a limited amount of rubber and bitumen particles 300 µm were observed in this study and thus statements regarding the treatment of these particles cannot be made other microplastic particles 300 µm were more abundant than rubber and bitumen particles in that size range with the data indicating that these compounds were relatively efficiently removed by the treatment train as was the case for rubber and bitumen particles 300 µm other microplastic particles occurred in higher concentrations in the 100 300 µm fraction than in the 300 µm fraction this is consistent with previous research i e the concentrations of microplastic particles tend to increase with decreasing filter mesh size covernton et al 2019 smyth et al 2021 the presented findings demonstrate that the biofilter and sand filters were responsible for the observed removal of microplastic particles the gpt did not effectively remove rubber bitumen or other microplastic particles in either of the evaluated size fractions this is in line with the results of klöckner et al 2019 who only investigated one rain event at a stormwater treatment train consisting of a sedimentation basin and soil retention filter their samples were analyzed for tire and road wear particles by analyzing the zn content of the light fractions 1 9 g cm³ although there is no consensus in the literature that zn content is a good proxy for tire wear the results indicate that concentrations of tire and road wear particles slightly increased from the sedimentation basin 0 57 0 07 mg zn g to the closest sampling point at the soil retention filter 0 65 0 13 mg zn g similarly numerous other studies have indicated that sedimentation ponds are inefficient means for the removal of microplastic particles excluding tire wear and bitumen particles liu et al 2019 2019 olesen et al 2019 the most likely reason that gpts are ineffective at removing these microplastic particles is the relatively low density of rubber halle et al 2020 bitumen unice et al 2019 and other microplastic particles kooi and koelmans 2019 which may translate to low sedimentation rates the hypothesis that bioretention systems can retain microplastics was confirmed by the results for particles in the 100 300 µm size fraction likely the filters also remove microplastics in the larger fraction efficiently however to prove that further studies with larger sample volumes would be required to enable quantification of the compared to the 100 300 µm fraction low concentrations in the 300 µm fraction to date only two studies have investigated the treatment of microplastics in bioretention systems in a study of anthropogenic microparticles including rubber paint plastic and asphalt fragments and fibers among others in the in and outflow of a bioretention system gilbreath et al 2019 found that particles were retained well across all three observed rain events with removal efficiencies of 55 125 355 µm fraction 81 355 500 µm fraction and 100 500 µm furthermore smyth et al 2021 showed that a bioretention system can reduce the concentrations of microplastic particles between 106 300 µm in size by 63 as suggested by smyth et al 2021 the process underlying effective microplastic removal is most likely filtration the presented results provide evidence that both the vegetated biofilter and the sand filter were generally able to efficiently remove microplastic particles while rubber and bitumen were removed equally well by both filter cells the vegetated filter was statistically significantly better at removing other microplastic particles however the difference between the effluents from the vegetated and sand only filters 0 33 particles l and 0 86 particles l respectively likely has no or only little practical significance as such a general statement that bioretention systems with plants are preferable to sand only filters for the treatment of microplastics cannot be made based on this study although the presented results as well as findings from two other studies gilbreath et al 2019 smyth et al 2021 suggest that bioretention systems effectively retain microplastic 100 300 µm further research in diverse catchments is needed to corroborate these claims moreover future studies should include the size fractions not analysed in this study smaller particle sizes i e 100 µm are highly relevant because for example tire wear particles are often 100 µm wagner et al 2018 or even 100 nm in size kukutschová et al 2011 which have not been evaluated for stormwater bioretention furthermore microplastic particles captured in bioretention systems may degrade over time due to weathering processes unice et al 2019 and thus become finer and or more mobile o connor et al 2019 this justifies the need to also analyze larger particles there is previous evidence that bioretention systems are effective at removing particles tss particulate metals down to 0 45 µm in size davis et al 2009 however other studies have shown that environmental conditions such as dry periods can negatively affect the performance of bioretention systems towards tss 1 2 µm and particulate metals 0 45 µm blecken et al 2009 lange et al 2020 moreover o connor et al 2019 found that the penetration depth of polyethylene particles in soil columns may be influenced by wet dry cycles thus it is plausible that environmental conditions e g extended dry periods affect how readily microplastic particles 0 45 µm penetrate the filter material o connor et al 2019 found that specifically the mobility of particles with higher densities may be increased by wet dry cycles that could be relevant for rubber and bitumen particles which are encrusted with minerals unice et al 2019 despite efficient microplastic removal microplastic concentrations in the effluent of the bioretention systems varied between 0 26 and 0 87 particles l depending on the presence of vegetation on the filter and the type of microplastic these concentrations are still 1000 fold higher than concentrations measured from the baltic sea e g 0 21 0 15 particles m3 plankton sample 100 µm beer et al 2018 further the accumulation of traffic related microplastics in bioretention systems could lead to lethal concentrations of toxic substances in receiving waters as tian et al 2021 discovered that 6ppd n 1 3 dimethylbutyl n phenyl p phenylenediamine quinone which originates from tire wear particles contributes to mortality in a pacific salmon species based on these findings the researchers emphasized that evaluations of stormwater pollutants cannot solely focus on the previously defined priority substances but also assess how other compounds can impact the surrounding environment this claim needs to be integrated into future research concerning how effective bioretention systems are at removing microplastic particles the high concentrations of rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles in the surface water of the gpt close to the overflow pit table 2 indicate that particles suspended in the top layer miller et al 2021 may be released into receiving waters during overflow events the environmental impact of this type of situation depends on the design of the bioretention facility which determines the frequency of overflows the presented results indicate that other microplastic particles relatively low density are most likely to be released with overflowing surface water followed by rubber and bitumen particles in the 100 300 µm fraction this dynamic is predominantly linked to the increasing densities of the materials microplastic particles very variable 1 g cm³ according to kooi and koelmans 2019 rubber 1 15 and 1 20 g cm3 according to halle et al 2020 bitumen 1 8 g cm³ according to unice et al 2019 thus the overflow pits of catchments with a particularly high fraction of lighter microplastic particles relative to rubber and bitumen particles smyth et al 2021 gilbreath et al 2019 could impair the treatment performance of bioretention systems similar to other pollutants in stormwater in this study the overflow pit was located in the gpt i e it was not in direct contact with the filter in other designs the overflow pit is commonly placed within the bioretention filter bed this could involve a risk for the release of low density microplastics which had accumulated on top of the filter surface however this remains a speculative hypothesis with further studies needed to evaluate that risk associated with overflow pits along with their specific location 5 conclusion the results of this study on microplastic treatment in a bioretention system equipped with a gross pollutant trap suggest that stormwater from highway catchments can contain high but varying concentrations of rubber 740 to 0 31 particles l and bitumen 870 to 0 31 particles l particles between 100 300 µm in size rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles 300 µm occurred in far lower concentrations and were not quantified frequently 19 to 0 07 3 1 to 0 07 and 0 69 to 0 24 particles l respectively the gross pollutant trap did not provide effective treatment of rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles between 100 300 µm in size bioretention systems however did show sufficient treatment performance often with high removal percentages exceeding 70 thus providing an overall sufficient performance of the treatment train lower removals or leaching were only observed in some occasions both the vegetated and non vegetated filter cells demonstrated effective treatment of the studied microplastics for both filters removal percentages exceeded mostly 70 except for the removal of other microplastic particles by the non vegetated filter which was lower excessive water inflows i e those which surpass the designed capacity of the treatment train may contribute to the discharge of rubber bitumen and other microplastic particles to receiving waters further studies should include evaluation of the removal of microplastic fractions 100 µm removal efficiencies and pathways of microplastic fractions 300 µm integrate environmental factors such as dry wet periods and investigate the fates of potential microplastic leachates declaration of

16818,current practice to enhance resilience in water resource recovery facilities wrrfs is to ensure redundancy or back up for most critical equipment e g pumps or blowers model based assessment allows evaluation of different strategies for quantitatively and efficiently enhancing resilience and justifying the allocation of resources the goal of this study is to provide guidance for the development of tailored deterministic models of full scale wrrfs a framework for model based resilience assessment is proposed that provides guidance on data collection model selection model calibration and scenario analysis the framework is embedded into the good modeling practice gmp unified protocol providing a new application for resilience assessment and an initial set of stressors for wrrfs the usefulness of the framework is illustrated through a resilience assessment of the wrrf of girona against power outage results show that for the girona facility limited energy back up can cause non compliance of wrrf discharge limits in the case of a blower power shut down of 6 h and around 12 h when the blower shut down is also combined with a shut down of the recirculation pumps the best option to enhance resilience would be increasing the power back up by 218 which allows the plant to run with recirculation pumps and blowers at minimum capacity in such a case resilience can be further enhanced by manipulating the air supply valves to optimise the air distribution to balance oxygen needs in each reactor with the overall system pressure we conclude that with industry consensus on what is considered an acceptable level of resilience a framework for resilience assessment would be a useful tool to enhance the resilience of our current water infrastructure further research is needed to establish if the permit structure should accommodate levels sof functionality to account for stress events graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wrrf resilience modelling stressor dynamic airflow model quantitative assessment uncertainty 1 introduction driven by the increasing impact of climate change design and optimisation of urban water infrastructure is under pressure to evolve to minimize the potential consequences of natural disasters and extreme events ganin et al 2016 moddemeyer 2015 water resource recovery facility wrrf design will need to consider resilience to make environmentally sustainable choices as part of the decision making process regmi et al 2018 enhancing the resilience of wrrfs is essential for our environment but will add additional costs during design operation and upgrading in the short term however studies lawson et al 2020 show that more resilient systems provide long term savings through the recovery costs after process disruptions during the infrastructure s lifespan methodologies are being developed for resilience assessment the current practice to enhance resilience in wrrfs is to ensure redundancy or back up for the most critical equipment e g pumps and blowers beyond what is needed to ensure continuous operation however this approach does not provide sound quantification of resilience against the main causes of performance loss stressors hence making it impossible to rank potential alternatives to enhance resilience using a model based assessment approach enables quantitative evaluation of different strategies for enhancing resilience and properly allocating resources for the short mid and long term several studies incorporate resilience in the design operation and upgrade of wrrfs e g ukwir 2017 gay and sinha 2014 through qualitative frameworks that make use of check lists i e to assess the level of redundant equipment only a few studies have proposed quantitative approaches to address resilience in wrrfs which make use of existing wrrf process models widely accepted by the community existing work focuses on reducing cost and enhancing resilience through real time control meng et al 2017 process optimisation through statistical and fault tree analysis ba alawi et al 2020 and system design sweetapple et al 2018 2019 jafarinejad 2020 has developed a procedural framework to review the available methods to assess resilience of wrrfs against stressors however these frameworks are either untested or tested on virtual systems i e the bsm2 platform described in gernaey et al 2014 and virtual river models and do not provide guidelines on the overall modeling approach previous resilience studies that use process simulation and historical data of equipment failures to assess the effects of mechanical stressors include currie et al 2014 which have identified the need to measure real stress events to validate their approach without consensus on a common terminology and framework by the modeling community each study measures resilience in a different manner which makes comparison between sites impossible and thus precludes efficient resource allocation this paper aims to provide guidance on the development of deterministic models for quantitative resilience assessment in real life systems building upon the existing good modeling practice guidelines rieger et al 2012 critical steps are listed and model setup calibration and validation issues are discussed together with criteria and metrics for a quantitative resilience evaluation the case study presented in this work calibrates detailed process and equipment models to a measured power outage event and applies an in depth analysis of the required model set up and data needs the plant model integrates state of the art mechanistic process models with detailed air distribution system and pump models to understand the stressors effect on the underlying processes that influence the resilience of the plant the study discusses the simulation results as well as the barriers for a quantitative resilience assessment namely i the need to agree on a standard level of resilience and ii the limitations of the current permit structure 2 resilience framework this section presents the terminology and steps of the proposed framework for model based resilience assessment of wrrfs resilience assessment is an emerging field in wastewater treatment and therefore it is paramount to attain consensus on the meaning of the terminology used the following terms have been found to describe each key element of a resilience assessment project 2 1 terminology and definitions 2 1 1 resilience several definitions of resilience exist within the engineering field the definition used in this work is the original definition by walker et al 2004 on ecological systems resilience is the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to retain essentially the same pre disturbance process form identity and feedbacks this definition captures the meaning of resilience in a straightforward manner 2 1 2 resilience assessment resilience assessment is a study that aims to measure the degree of resilience of any given asset network or system against one or multiple stressors juan garcía et al 2017 2 1 3 stressors stressors are disturbances that pose a risk to a system s function and performance in the case of water resource recovery this may include storm events industrial spills equipment failures and power outages the definition of a stressor in this study covers extreme events not normal daily or seasonal variations for practical use stressors are further distinguished into observed stressors an event has occurred in the past and data are available and unobserved stressors the stressor has been identified by a theoretical analysis but no observations exist especially for unobserved stressors a model based analysis of the impact is beneficial as the model should represent if properly set up the typical behaviour of a plant in response to a stressor 2 1 4 levels of functionality desired performance that a wrrf must maintain under normal operation full functionality and under the impact of a stressor reduced but accepted functionality define the levels of functionality the plant may also change its function temporarily to better cope with the situation and prevent long lasting performance reduction for instance if the plant receives a storm flow above the capacity of the secondary or tertiary treatment step part of the flow may only receive primary treatment and then be diverted to a storm tank or directly discharged to the receiving water however this strategy involves a state of temporal reduced functionality and therefore must be specified in the compliance permit 2 1 5 properties of resilience resilience is an emerging property of a system it arises from the combination of different characteristics that are linked and act together the most relevant properties in water resource recovery systems are robustness ability to reduce the severity of the impact of an unexpected stressor e g robustness against equipment failure can be improved by redundant equipment against power outage by having emergency generators or multiple power sources and industrial spills can be attenuated by early warning systems and diversion tanks rapidity of recovery time to recover from a stressor to an accepted state e g nitrification capacity may be limited after a significant loss of sludge due to a storm event until sufficient mass of nitrifiers have been regrown the time to recovery is defined as the period since the stressor is detected until the system recovers to the level of acceptable performance typically defined in the plant s effluent or treatment performance permit adaptability the goal for designing resilient systems ability to accommodate changes within or around the system and establish response behaviours aimed at building robustness and increasing the speed of recovery this starts in the design phase and incorporates flexibility and redundancy in operation 2 1 6 impacted variables impacted variables are sensitive to the effects of the stressor under study the ideal variable will be easily measurable and relevant for the desired level of functionality i e effluent quality energy and resource consumption or cost 2 1 7 resilience metrics resilience metrics are indicators of the performance of the system relative to the desired level of functionality metrics link the value of the impacted variable to the properties of resilience and provide quantitative meaning i e if studying clarifier performance under storm conditions the maximum measured concentration of total suspended solids tss in the effluent can be an indicator of robustness and the time the plant needs to recover an effluent tss concentration within compliance would be an indicator of rapidity 2 2 framework steps this work adds a new application to the activated sludge modeling standard defined in the gmp guidelines rieger et al 2012 the gmp unified protocol provides an application matrix where various model applications requirements and relative efforts are described table 1 shows the new application with two examples for resilience assessment dynamic simulation is required to capture the effect of the stressor on the plant metrics need to be designed to measure system performance concerning the scoring i project definition has been assigned a value of 4 due to the novelty of designing a resilience assessment modeling exercise ii data collection and reconciliation is complex since stressors will need to be monitored the example with clarifier malfunction has a higher score as measuring clarifier settling requires more effort than blower capacity which can be extracted from the scada system iii model setup is also considered complex as the sub models need to be carefully considered again the clarifier example has a higher score since settling models still do not have the consensus achieved with control models that can be easily simulated as a pid controller iv calibration has been assigned a value of 4 to account for the sub models and the stressor s that need to be calibrated on top of the baseline asm v simulation and interpretation of results receives a value of 5 as there are many scenarios sensitivity analysis and data to be processed specific metrics need to be designed and uncertainty plays a critical role in the results each step of the protocol has been reviewed with a focus on those aspects that concern resilience assessment a diagram that illustrates the revised protocol is shown in fig 1 the diagram is explained in detail through sections 2 2 1 to 2 2 5 2 2 1 project definition the first step of the gmp unified protocol is to identify the objective of the study the assessment needs to define the stressors against which the system will be tested and set the required level of complexity of the model to simulate them the goals may vary in scope from understanding the effect of a stressor to undertaking a thorough evaluation of strategies to enhance resilience against one or more stressors if the stressors are not predetermined a procedure needs to be developed to decide which stressors should be included in the study for example a first simulation study can be used to identify the main vulnerabilities alternatively a qualitative framework or a study of system and environmental characteristics can be used to short list relevant stressors historical failure data is useful to define the probability of a stressor happening and expert opinion can be used to assess the potential disruption level finally stressors are prioritised for detailed assessment depending on the potential loss of functionality as an indicator of relevance 2 2 2 data collection the application matrix describes the requirements in terms of data collection ideally the monitoring campaign should capture an observed stressor by monitoring or by designing dedicated experiments this involves close measurement of the magnitude of the stressor e g duration of a power outage or duration and intensity of a storm event and loss of performance e g a time series of pollutants discharged to the environment or energy consumption with regards to unobserved stressors e g equipment failure specific detailed models may be used to assess its impact e g first principle equipment models for example generic wrrf influent generators are valuable tools to generate realistic time series of input variables as stressors to the system martin and vanrolleghem 2014 such as storm events talebizadeh et al 2016 or the presence of inhibition or toxic substances rosen et al 2008a pons 2007 the wastewater modeling community is challenged to develop and agree on a set of standard stressors and how to model them validating models and procedures for observed stressors will lead to confidence in modeling unobserved stressors the authors have put together a first list in table 2 2 2 3 plant model set up the model of a wrrf consists of a series of sub models influent bioreactors pumps aeration system sensors hydraulics and settling tank models in the case of resilience this framework defines 4 categories of sub models apart from the baseline model i stressors perturbance models i e stormwater catchment spill power outage equipment malfunction ii operator actions sub models to represent the normal adaptation of the operational settings by the operators to get the plant s performance back into compliance they deal with seasonal variation or slowly changing load conditions and are typically modelled as a slowly tuned controller iii recovery models sub models to simulate a realistic recovery from a stressor e g start up delays of equipment times to replace faulty equipment service cycles etc process models have been developed to be used during normal operating conditions but resilience deals with extreme conditions sweetapple et al 2017 model set up should ensure that the selected models can describe the conditions and behaviour triggered by the stressor under assessment in table 2 the stressor screening is linked to literature on ongoing research of each relevant sub model when possible mechanistic first principle models of equipment like pumps and blowers should be used as their uncertainty is less affected by the operating conditions schraa and gray 2017 for the case study presented in this work the use of a detailed integrated model combining process equipment especially the aeration system sensors and controls is particularly relevant enabling a holistic view on the studied system 2 2 4 calibration and validation it is suggested to follow model setup and calibration procedures as recommended in the gmp unified protocol rieger et al 2012 calibration can be applied to normal operating conditions as there typically are sufficient data available validation would then be carried out including observed stressors the calibration and validation steps are more challenging with respect to existing gmp applications normally the user would calibrate the model using data from a period under normal operating conditions and would validate with data obtained under different conditions environmental or operational in view of the expected extrapolation but still without the influence of stressors in the case of resilience assessment the model should work both under normal and abnormal conditions under the effect of a stressor existing asm type models may work perfectly fine for a system that operates under normal conditions whereas simulating the effect of extreme stressors might require adaptation of the model structure for instance proper simulation of a storm event may require an increase in hydrodynamic model complexity especially the primary and secondary settlers 2 2 5 simulation and results a set of metrics for the properties of resilience must be calculated to interpret the results table 3 shows a metric proposal to account for robustness rapidity of recovery and adaptability in a conventional activated sludge plant a visual representation of these metrics is shown in the supplementary material fig a5 and in fig 5 for the full scale case study if the study includes unobserved stressors it is necessary to consider their uncertainty on model results this can be done by carrying out a sensitivity analysis of the stressor intensity and the parameters of the mitigation strategy if any the modeller should try to find thresholds in the behaviour of the system and understand why they occur e g how the settling capacity is impacted by different combinations of stormwater flows settleability and storage capacity a description of techniques for applying uncertainty analysis can be found in belia et al 2009 and talebizadeh et al 2016 3 case study girona wrrf this section applies the methodology described above to the full scale wrrf of girona catalonia spain in a case of resilience assessment against power outage the case study is used to validate the proposed framework 3 1 case study description the girona wrrf receives an average of 55 000 m3 d 1 of domestic wastewater and has a designed capacity to serve 2 75 000 population equivalents the plant is a conventional activated sludge system in a five stage bardenpho configuration however chemical phosphorus removal is currently practised the biological stage consists of two parallel treatment lanes each split into 7 zones in both the model and the real plant of which 4 are aerated see fig 2 the aeration system consists of a main blower one support blower and one stand by blower for redundancy the blowers serve a main header which splits into two header pipes each controlled by an automatic valve and followed by four manual zone valves the sensors for on line measurements of dissolved oxygen do are currently placed at the end of the biological reactors aer4 the air supply blower set is controlled by the average do of both lanes by varying the speed and guide vanes of the blowers fig 2 signal the do measurement in each lane is used to manipulate the positions of the automatic main header valves a more detailed description of the plant is described in juan garcía et al 2018 where the baseline model is built and calibrated to be used in an energy audit the modeling platform simba was chosen due to its unique capabilities to simulate the full aeration system with mechanistic models schraa et al 2017 as demonstrated in juan garcía et al 2018 the aeration system design causes around 90 of the airflow to be directed towards the head of the plant a full layout is shown in the supplementary material figs a1 and a2 during a power outage the plant has back up generators to power the influent pumps 4 pumps of 55 kw each but recirculation pumps and blowers remain inactive a list with all the energy consumption of various equipment at the girona wrrf is available in the supplementary information table a2 3 2 approach following the proposed framework 3 2 1 project definition enhancing resilience against power outage the plant experiences occasional power outages as occurs in many wrrfs it relies on external sources of energy and building resilience against these events is a priority for the wrrf managers this study analyses the following i assess how much time the system can withstand critical equipment shut down ii prioritise further investments in back up energy iii develop a mitigation strategy in case of limited back up power supply for the blowers iv compare the total cost of the applied measures to the level of resilience that is deemed acceptable two sets of simulations were designed the first set carried out a scenario analysis on equipment shut down duration 6 12 24 48 h for blowers and recirculation pumps although the plant uses diffusers as the main source of mixing in the aeration basins if the aeration stops the real plant is equipped with low speed mixers which for the purposes of this study are assumed to be functional with a total energy consumption of 15 kw the second set simulates the plant during a 48 h power outage where an investment has been made in back up energy to power recirculation pumps and blowers the blower capacity is set to a minimum to preserve back up power and thus limit the necessary generators a scenario analysis is carried out on different strategies of airflow distribution using the manual valves as control handles 3 2 2 data collection plant dynamics were collected from a period between the 18th and the 20th of june 2017 it includes a period of dry weather data with detailed flow measurements every 15 min and a data campaign consisting of i online measurements of do in all reactors and nhx at the entrance of the biological treatment and aer2 ii composite sampling of influent and reactors 4 grab samples per day in all 7 reactors plus hourly samples in reactors ana1 and aer2 iii energy consumption monitoring iv scada system files with blower capacity monitoring v influent wastewater fractionation vi reject water fractionation vii plant laboratory analysis of 24 h composite effluent samples stress tests included a 30 min power outage in blowers and recirculation pumps a change in the valve opening of aer3 in one lane and a change of the controlled reactor from rear to head which includes lowering the do setpoint from 1 5 to 1 mg l 1 these tests are intended to collect system performance information against sudden changes fig 3 shows the plant performance during the stress tests over time figs a4 and a6 to a9 show the scada report during the power outage event for dissolved oxygen and blower capacity respectively table a3 shows all types of information collected source frequency and duration table a4 shows the mass balance obtained with the steady state model 3 2 3 plant model set up the calibrated baseline model in juan garcía et al 2018 which was implemented in the advanced modeling platform simba was upgraded to assess resilience whole plant modeling was needed as the sludge recirculation depends on intermittent pumping and the reject water constitutes up to 20 of the influent nutrient load and determines the hourly influent profile a tracer test using bromide was executed to define the number of cstrs and estimate the hydraulic retention time the analysis of the tracer test concluded that each line of the biological reactor could be modelled as a series of 8 cstrs the biokinetic model asm inctrl simba s in house model takes into account 2 step nitrification denitrification and bio p needed to model the nutrient removal capacity a dynamic airflow distribution sub model is used schraa et al 2017 that includes mechanistic sub models for blowers pipes fittings valves and diffusers and calculates pressure in every part of the aeration system a static model could not consider equipment limitations and operational settings necessary to assess the limited power back up and operational changes the air distribution model requires detailed system characteristics but very limited calibration results show that it can accurately simulate the airflow distribution and responds realistically to changes in operational settings and equipment failures of the aeration system an overview of the process and aeration model layout is available in figs a1 and a2 respectively aeration control was accounted for by means of pi or pid controllers settling is accounted for by a10 layer takacs model takacs et al 1991 clarifier model improved in simba by explicitly taking the sludge concentration of the lower layer into account to model the exchange streams between layers full details of this implementation are available in alex 2011 the n2 gas concentration and the sludge blanket level and concentration are monitored as indicators of clarifier breakdown the models for the stressors consist of power limitations and outages in various equipment created by adjusting the input and settings in the equipment model blocks the operator response to the stressor is simulated with slowly tuned controllers for i internal recirculation based on no3 concentration in the anoxic reactor ii do setpoint in the monitored reactor based on effluent ammonia iii wastage pump flow controlled by tss in aer4 settings for all pid controllers are available in the supplementary material table a1 the adaptation of operational settings by the operators facing stressors include the three described controllers plus automated changes in the position of the manual valves regulating the airflow in each scenario 3 2 4 calibration and validation with the baseline calibration already completed juan garcía et al 2018 this study calibrated the additional sub models described in 3 2 3 with a more exhaustive data campaign including stress tests described in 3 2 2 the model was calibrated without changing the bio kinetic model parameters which supports the validity of the predictions to calibrate against stressors the software was automated to recreate a 30 min power outage in all modelled equipment except influent pumps and mixers changes in manual valve position do setpoint and control do probe position were set to replicate those registered during the stress test experiment the goodness of fit of the kwh consumed by the blower in re calibration can be seen in fig 3 the goodness of fit of the ammonia calibration in reactors and the primary clarifier is shown in fig 4 to validate the model it was tested against the first dataset used in the data campaign from juan garcía et al 2018 the goodness of fit is shown in the supplementary material fig a3 errors between experimental and simulated data have been calculated for 4 different metrics following the methodology in hauduc et al 2015a results are presented in the supplementary material table a5 3 2 5 simulation and results set up a prior analysis showed that total nitrogen in the effluent tn is the most critical variable for compliance and therefore has been chosen as the main impacted variable to monitor the stressor fig 5 shows a graphical representation using the results for the dynamic simulation of the 12 h blower power outage table 3 contains a generic description of the metrics used applied to tn these are i rapidity time to recover a tn effluent concentration under compliance limits 10 mg l 1 since the start of the event fig 5 brown dashed line ii robustness loss max tn effluent concentration during stress event fig 5 green purple line iii global resilience index gri accumulated kg of nitrogen in the effluent above compliance limit fig 5 blue area normalized by recovery time this metric integrates both rapidity and robustness and acts as a measure of the adaptability of the plant to the stressor the first set of simulations carries out a scenario analysis on power outage duration for recirculation pumps and blowers independently during 6 12 24 and 48 h power outages the second set of simulations tests the following six scenarios of aeration settings table 4 4 results 4 1 equipment vulnerability assessment the main effect of a recirculation pump shutdown on performance is due to the accumulation of sludge in the clarifier this eventually causes loss of sludge to the effluent which progressively reduces all biological activity in the reactors up to 2 days the virtual clarifier showed no signs of breakdown i e rapid increase in sludge blanket only the 48 h outage showed significant loss of sludge and related long term impacts on treatment performance blower shutdown had a more immediate effect on effluent quality as the lack of oxygen completely stops aerobic activity the virtual plant entered noncompliance after 6 h of blower shut down compared to 12 h in case of pump recirculation shut down fig 6 results show that for all power outage durations both the maximum effluent tn robustness and total mass of nitrogen above compliance limits gri are larger in blower shut down scenarios than recirculation pump scenarios fig 6 centre right however the importance of blowers versus recirculation pumps is heavily influenced by the short term nature of the case study 2 days plant recovery was quick around 3 days from any equipment shutdown up to 2 days fig 6 left the virtual plant recovered almost at the same time regardless of the equipment affected although the recovery time seems to increase faster for recirculation pumps than for blowers the long term impacts of losing sludge are potentially larger than those caused by lack of aeration capacity whereas keeping up the recirculation pumps may prevent sludge loss however this is heavily influenced by settleability the svi will determine how effective preventing sludge loss through recirculation can be for this case study power outages in aeration equipment have a higher impact in resilience than recirculation pumps if only aeration is considered resilience could be enhanced by increasing the back up energy available for blowers which requires a generator of up to 230 kw to keep its full functionality if all equipment is considered the most cost efficient option is to run the plant with recirculation pumps and the blower at minimum capacity in this case the plant requires extra back up of 260 kw 218 increase a list of relevant equipment and its power consumption for the girona wrrf is available in the supplementary material table a2 4 2 resilience assessment of various aeration strategies with limited energy back up in case of limited energy back up the simulations show that scenarios which favour redirecting airflow towards the head of the plant favour head only head are less resilient than the base case fig 7 centre right in terms of robustness and gri the most resilient scenarios are favour rear and open valves redirecting airflow towards the rear of the plant seems to be beneficial but there is a turning point as shown by the poor performance in only rear rapidity is clearly governed by the dynamics of the influent fig 7 left the effluent of all scenarios returns to compliance almost at the same time which is when the flow and the load during the low peak period enter the reactors understanding the effect that airflow redirection has on process performance is only possible thanks to the dynamic air supply model which simulates the changes of pressure in each part of the piping system and calculates the airflow supplied to each reactor fig 8 shows the average oxygen effectively supplied to each aerated reactor otr minus the average oxygen used by the process our due to heavy diffuser tapering and the characteristics of the aeration system piping the plant airflow is mostly directed towards the first two reactors aer1 and 2 whereas aer3 is clearly lacking oxygen fig 8 base case open valves this creates an imbalance in air supply demand that is further accentuated in those scenarios where airflow is favoured towards the head of the plant favour head only head by closing the manual valves in reactors aer1 and aer2 it is possible to balance the airflow supply demand fig 8 favour rear this maximizes oxygen use and oxygen transfer driving force at the expense of increased system pressure when the manual valves in aer1 and aer2 are kept open to a minimum to maximise the resilience when the blower is run at limited capacity two strategies are available 1 optimize oxygen supply demand to maximise oxygen transfer driving force and 2 minimise system pressure to maximise blower performance the fact that similar effluent quality is obtained in the scenario that best balances airflow and the scenario that minimizes system pressure fig 8 suggests that in this case both factors have equal weight in plant performance however the strategies have competing system settings the first one requires closing the valves in the first two reactors to favour rear aeration the second requires opening all valves which redirects airflow towards the head but due to lower pressure drops in the piping network delivers more air 5 discussion 5 1 a framework for model based resilience assessment this paper proposes a framework for model based resilience assessment of water resource recovery facilities based on the gmp unified protocol rieger et al 2012 the guideline extension responds to the pressure on public utilities to prepare for climate change impacts and get more resilient tepes and neumann 2020 the framework has been tested against data from the girona wrrf catalonia spain in previous studies currie et al 2014 modelled a wrrf and considered historical equipment reliability data equipment configuration and criticality and insights from site personnel including aspects relating to maintenance spares and equipment reliability to define several scenarios which were then simulated this study did not place an emphasis on the wrrf design and operating characteristics data collection reconciliation calibration and validation currie et al 2014 sweetapple et al 2018 and sweetapple et al 2019 use a benchmark model jeppsson et al 2008 for their resilience assessments while the approach is fair to draw general conclusions on the resilience of a wrrf against different types of stressors it does not provide fit for purpose recommendations for a specific plant the work in the current study is valid for observed stressors which can be calibrated and validated and the model structure is updated to account for changes caused by the effect of stressors e g hydraulics and sludge settleability unobserved stressors require more expert knowledge to be set up as the effect cannot be validated which means there has to be an industry effort to validating models and procedures we already have a very good understanding how to model some of the stressors for example there are accepted mechanistic models for equipment and sensors but hydrodynamics and settling are two critical issues where community agreement on standard stressors needs to be attained part of these limitations might be compensated by the application of uncertainty assessments belia et al 2009 one of the greater challenges is to perform model based quantitative resilience assessment for stressors which rarely occur i e once in the entire lifespan existing models are valid under normal functioning of the wrrfs the capacity of existing wrrf models to describe system recovery after total breakdown remains untested such capabilities would be essential to study resilience of wrrfs against extreme events e g extensive flooding tornadoes wildfire where the plant undergoes total breakdown for such events there are no historical data to calibrate the model to properly describe the effects of that stressor hence the uncertainties are much higher 5 2 analysis of measures to enhance resilience assessment this study allowed establishing an energy backup which would allow enhancing resilience to a level of functionality that was considered acceptable by the plant operators while using a cost effective aeration system configuration and ensuring the recovery of the system in no later than 2 days the recommendations are specific for the girona wrrf in this scenario the stakeholders define a desired level of service e g the maxim number of days allows for system non compliance then run simulations to decide on where to invest more efficiently however this is dependent on the levels of functionality that a wrrf must maintain under stress conditions it may be impossible for the plant to maintain full compliance under a critical event in this case it could be possible to minimise the detrimental effect of the environment by focusing on plant resilience instead of solely effluent compliance if we accept that there are situations infrequently impacting treatment performance it could be beneficial to change our permit structure to allow for a certain number of situations where we accept a lower performance for a limited period of time in exchange for reduced environmental damage in the long term the findings of this work are in line with currie et al 2014 on the importance of blower failures on process performance yet this study focuses on power outage and identifies fall back strategies to overcome it sweetapple et al 2018 2019 focus on the relationship between resilience risk reliability and sustainability as concluded in the current study they claimed that methodologies up to date address only a small fraction of the possibilities of resilience and a more comprehensive assessment of a system s response to threats is necessary to provide a comprehensive understanding of risk and resilience 6 conclusion this work presents a framework which includes guidance on how to use activated sludge modeling for resilience assessment and puts it into context within the current best practice in activated sludge modeling rieger et al 2012 the framework is validated through an application of a model based resilience assessment against power outage at a full scale plant the existing back up system of the plant is designed to prevent flooding thus we have focused our analysis to treatment objectives beyond flood protection the most important conclusions are summarized as follows a framework and procedures for quantitative model based resilience assessment has been designed within the context of the gmp protocol including definitions of terminology an initial set of standard stressors and the models necessary to simulate them has been proposed to help utilities and modellers execute resilience assessments table 2 more work is needed to agree on a comprehensive list of stressors the case study showcases the applicability and usefulness of model based resilience assessment applied to power outages for a full framework on resilience assessment to be completed there needs to be industry consensus on what is considered an acceptable level of resilience and how it should be measured of all the power dependant equipment in a wrrf blowers caused the highest loss of resilience in the plant for short term power outages less than 24 h however the existing back up system is designed to prevent flooding of the plant and the sewer network a different result may be achieved if flood protection was included in the assessment increasing the power back up by 218 would allow the plant to run with recirculation pumps and blowers at minimum capacity during a power outage thus minimizing performance loss optimizing the trade off between oxygen needs and aeration system pressure can further enhance resilience further research is needed to establish if the permit structure should accommodate levels of functionality to account for stress events declaration of

16818,current practice to enhance resilience in water resource recovery facilities wrrfs is to ensure redundancy or back up for most critical equipment e g pumps or blowers model based assessment allows evaluation of different strategies for quantitatively and efficiently enhancing resilience and justifying the allocation of resources the goal of this study is to provide guidance for the development of tailored deterministic models of full scale wrrfs a framework for model based resilience assessment is proposed that provides guidance on data collection model selection model calibration and scenario analysis the framework is embedded into the good modeling practice gmp unified protocol providing a new application for resilience assessment and an initial set of stressors for wrrfs the usefulness of the framework is illustrated through a resilience assessment of the wrrf of girona against power outage results show that for the girona facility limited energy back up can cause non compliance of wrrf discharge limits in the case of a blower power shut down of 6 h and around 12 h when the blower shut down is also combined with a shut down of the recirculation pumps the best option to enhance resilience would be increasing the power back up by 218 which allows the plant to run with recirculation pumps and blowers at minimum capacity in such a case resilience can be further enhanced by manipulating the air supply valves to optimise the air distribution to balance oxygen needs in each reactor with the overall system pressure we conclude that with industry consensus on what is considered an acceptable level of resilience a framework for resilience assessment would be a useful tool to enhance the resilience of our current water infrastructure further research is needed to establish if the permit structure should accommodate levels sof functionality to account for stress events graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wrrf resilience modelling stressor dynamic airflow model quantitative assessment uncertainty 1 introduction driven by the increasing impact of climate change design and optimisation of urban water infrastructure is under pressure to evolve to minimize the potential consequences of natural disasters and extreme events ganin et al 2016 moddemeyer 2015 water resource recovery facility wrrf design will need to consider resilience to make environmentally sustainable choices as part of the decision making process regmi et al 2018 enhancing the resilience of wrrfs is essential for our environment but will add additional costs during design operation and upgrading in the short term however studies lawson et al 2020 show that more resilient systems provide long term savings through the recovery costs after process disruptions during the infrastructure s lifespan methodologies are being developed for resilience assessment the current practice to enhance resilience in wrrfs is to ensure redundancy or back up for the most critical equipment e g pumps and blowers beyond what is needed to ensure continuous operation however this approach does not provide sound quantification of resilience against the main causes of performance loss stressors hence making it impossible to rank potential alternatives to enhance resilience using a model based assessment approach enables quantitative evaluation of different strategies for enhancing resilience and properly allocating resources for the short mid and long term several studies incorporate resilience in the design operation and upgrade of wrrfs e g ukwir 2017 gay and sinha 2014 through qualitative frameworks that make use of check lists i e to assess the level of redundant equipment only a few studies have proposed quantitative approaches to address resilience in wrrfs which make use of existing wrrf process models widely accepted by the community existing work focuses on reducing cost and enhancing resilience through real time control meng et al 2017 process optimisation through statistical and fault tree analysis ba alawi et al 2020 and system design sweetapple et al 2018 2019 jafarinejad 2020 has developed a procedural framework to review the available methods to assess resilience of wrrfs against stressors however these frameworks are either untested or tested on virtual systems i e the bsm2 platform described in gernaey et al 2014 and virtual river models and do not provide guidelines on the overall modeling approach previous resilience studies that use process simulation and historical data of equipment failures to assess the effects of mechanical stressors include currie et al 2014 which have identified the need to measure real stress events to validate their approach without consensus on a common terminology and framework by the modeling community each study measures resilience in a different manner which makes comparison between sites impossible and thus precludes efficient resource allocation this paper aims to provide guidance on the development of deterministic models for quantitative resilience assessment in real life systems building upon the existing good modeling practice guidelines rieger et al 2012 critical steps are listed and model setup calibration and validation issues are discussed together with criteria and metrics for a quantitative resilience evaluation the case study presented in this work calibrates detailed process and equipment models to a measured power outage event and applies an in depth analysis of the required model set up and data needs the plant model integrates state of the art mechanistic process models with detailed air distribution system and pump models to understand the stressors effect on the underlying processes that influence the resilience of the plant the study discusses the simulation results as well as the barriers for a quantitative resilience assessment namely i the need to agree on a standard level of resilience and ii the limitations of the current permit structure 2 resilience framework this section presents the terminology and steps of the proposed framework for model based resilience assessment of wrrfs resilience assessment is an emerging field in wastewater treatment and therefore it is paramount to attain consensus on the meaning of the terminology used the following terms have been found to describe each key element of a resilience assessment project 2 1 terminology and definitions 2 1 1 resilience several definitions of resilience exist within the engineering field the definition used in this work is the original definition by walker et al 2004 on ecological systems resilience is the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to retain essentially the same pre disturbance process form identity and feedbacks this definition captures the meaning of resilience in a straightforward manner 2 1 2 resilience assessment resilience assessment is a study that aims to measure the degree of resilience of any given asset network or system against one or multiple stressors juan garcía et al 2017 2 1 3 stressors stressors are disturbances that pose a risk to a system s function and performance in the case of water resource recovery this may include storm events industrial spills equipment failures and power outages the definition of a stressor in this study covers extreme events not normal daily or seasonal variations for practical use stressors are further distinguished into observed stressors an event has occurred in the past and data are available and unobserved stressors the stressor has been identified by a theoretical analysis but no observations exist especially for unobserved stressors a model based analysis of the impact is beneficial as the model should represent if properly set up the typical behaviour of a plant in response to a stressor 2 1 4 levels of functionality desired performance that a wrrf must maintain under normal operation full functionality and under the impact of a stressor reduced but accepted functionality define the levels of functionality the plant may also change its function temporarily to better cope with the situation and prevent long lasting performance reduction for instance if the plant receives a storm flow above the capacity of the secondary or tertiary treatment step part of the flow may only receive primary treatment and then be diverted to a storm tank or directly discharged to the receiving water however this strategy involves a state of temporal reduced functionality and therefore must be specified in the compliance permit 2 1 5 properties of resilience resilience is an emerging property of a system it arises from the combination of different characteristics that are linked and act together the most relevant properties in water resource recovery systems are robustness ability to reduce the severity of the impact of an unexpected stressor e g robustness against equipment failure can be improved by redundant equipment against power outage by having emergency generators or multiple power sources and industrial spills can be attenuated by early warning systems and diversion tanks rapidity of recovery time to recover from a stressor to an accepted state e g nitrification capacity may be limited after a significant loss of sludge due to a storm event until sufficient mass of nitrifiers have been regrown the time to recovery is defined as the period since the stressor is detected until the system recovers to the level of acceptable performance typically defined in the plant s effluent or treatment performance permit adaptability the goal for designing resilient systems ability to accommodate changes within or around the system and establish response behaviours aimed at building robustness and increasing the speed of recovery this starts in the design phase and incorporates flexibility and redundancy in operation 2 1 6 impacted variables impacted variables are sensitive to the effects of the stressor under study the ideal variable will be easily measurable and relevant for the desired level of functionality i e effluent quality energy and resource consumption or cost 2 1 7 resilience metrics resilience metrics are indicators of the performance of the system relative to the desired level of functionality metrics link the value of the impacted variable to the properties of resilience and provide quantitative meaning i e if studying clarifier performance under storm conditions the maximum measured concentration of total suspended solids tss in the effluent can be an indicator of robustness and the time the plant needs to recover an effluent tss concentration within compliance would be an indicator of rapidity 2 2 framework steps this work adds a new application to the activated sludge modeling standard defined in the gmp guidelines rieger et al 2012 the gmp unified protocol provides an application matrix where various model applications requirements and relative efforts are described table 1 shows the new application with two examples for resilience assessment dynamic simulation is required to capture the effect of the stressor on the plant metrics need to be designed to measure system performance concerning the scoring i project definition has been assigned a value of 4 due to the novelty of designing a resilience assessment modeling exercise ii data collection and reconciliation is complex since stressors will need to be monitored the example with clarifier malfunction has a higher score as measuring clarifier settling requires more effort than blower capacity which can be extracted from the scada system iii model setup is also considered complex as the sub models need to be carefully considered again the clarifier example has a higher score since settling models still do not have the consensus achieved with control models that can be easily simulated as a pid controller iv calibration has been assigned a value of 4 to account for the sub models and the stressor s that need to be calibrated on top of the baseline asm v simulation and interpretation of results receives a value of 5 as there are many scenarios sensitivity analysis and data to be processed specific metrics need to be designed and uncertainty plays a critical role in the results each step of the protocol has been reviewed with a focus on those aspects that concern resilience assessment a diagram that illustrates the revised protocol is shown in fig 1 the diagram is explained in detail through sections 2 2 1 to 2 2 5 2 2 1 project definition the first step of the gmp unified protocol is to identify the objective of the study the assessment needs to define the stressors against which the system will be tested and set the required level of complexity of the model to simulate them the goals may vary in scope from understanding the effect of a stressor to undertaking a thorough evaluation of strategies to enhance resilience against one or more stressors if the stressors are not predetermined a procedure needs to be developed to decide which stressors should be included in the study for example a first simulation study can be used to identify the main vulnerabilities alternatively a qualitative framework or a study of system and environmental characteristics can be used to short list relevant stressors historical failure data is useful to define the probability of a stressor happening and expert opinion can be used to assess the potential disruption level finally stressors are prioritised for detailed assessment depending on the potential loss of functionality as an indicator of relevance 2 2 2 data collection the application matrix describes the requirements in terms of data collection ideally the monitoring campaign should capture an observed stressor by monitoring or by designing dedicated experiments this involves close measurement of the magnitude of the stressor e g duration of a power outage or duration and intensity of a storm event and loss of performance e g a time series of pollutants discharged to the environment or energy consumption with regards to unobserved stressors e g equipment failure specific detailed models may be used to assess its impact e g first principle equipment models for example generic wrrf influent generators are valuable tools to generate realistic time series of input variables as stressors to the system martin and vanrolleghem 2014 such as storm events talebizadeh et al 2016 or the presence of inhibition or toxic substances rosen et al 2008a pons 2007 the wastewater modeling community is challenged to develop and agree on a set of standard stressors and how to model them validating models and procedures for observed stressors will lead to confidence in modeling unobserved stressors the authors have put together a first list in table 2 2 2 3 plant model set up the model of a wrrf consists of a series of sub models influent bioreactors pumps aeration system sensors hydraulics and settling tank models in the case of resilience this framework defines 4 categories of sub models apart from the baseline model i stressors perturbance models i e stormwater catchment spill power outage equipment malfunction ii operator actions sub models to represent the normal adaptation of the operational settings by the operators to get the plant s performance back into compliance they deal with seasonal variation or slowly changing load conditions and are typically modelled as a slowly tuned controller iii recovery models sub models to simulate a realistic recovery from a stressor e g start up delays of equipment times to replace faulty equipment service cycles etc process models have been developed to be used during normal operating conditions but resilience deals with extreme conditions sweetapple et al 2017 model set up should ensure that the selected models can describe the conditions and behaviour triggered by the stressor under assessment in table 2 the stressor screening is linked to literature on ongoing research of each relevant sub model when possible mechanistic first principle models of equipment like pumps and blowers should be used as their uncertainty is less affected by the operating conditions schraa and gray 2017 for the case study presented in this work the use of a detailed integrated model combining process equipment especially the aeration system sensors and controls is particularly relevant enabling a holistic view on the studied system 2 2 4 calibration and validation it is suggested to follow model setup and calibration procedures as recommended in the gmp unified protocol rieger et al 2012 calibration can be applied to normal operating conditions as there typically are sufficient data available validation would then be carried out including observed stressors the calibration and validation steps are more challenging with respect to existing gmp applications normally the user would calibrate the model using data from a period under normal operating conditions and would validate with data obtained under different conditions environmental or operational in view of the expected extrapolation but still without the influence of stressors in the case of resilience assessment the model should work both under normal and abnormal conditions under the effect of a stressor existing asm type models may work perfectly fine for a system that operates under normal conditions whereas simulating the effect of extreme stressors might require adaptation of the model structure for instance proper simulation of a storm event may require an increase in hydrodynamic model complexity especially the primary and secondary settlers 2 2 5 simulation and results a set of metrics for the properties of resilience must be calculated to interpret the results table 3 shows a metric proposal to account for robustness rapidity of recovery and adaptability in a conventional activated sludge plant a visual representation of these metrics is shown in the supplementary material fig a5 and in fig 5 for the full scale case study if the study includes unobserved stressors it is necessary to consider their uncertainty on model results this can be done by carrying out a sensitivity analysis of the stressor intensity and the parameters of the mitigation strategy if any the modeller should try to find thresholds in the behaviour of the system and understand why they occur e g how the settling capacity is impacted by different combinations of stormwater flows settleability and storage capacity a description of techniques for applying uncertainty analysis can be found in belia et al 2009 and talebizadeh et al 2016 3 case study girona wrrf this section applies the methodology described above to the full scale wrrf of girona catalonia spain in a case of resilience assessment against power outage the case study is used to validate the proposed framework 3 1 case study description the girona wrrf receives an average of 55 000 m3 d 1 of domestic wastewater and has a designed capacity to serve 2 75 000 population equivalents the plant is a conventional activated sludge system in a five stage bardenpho configuration however chemical phosphorus removal is currently practised the biological stage consists of two parallel treatment lanes each split into 7 zones in both the model and the real plant of which 4 are aerated see fig 2 the aeration system consists of a main blower one support blower and one stand by blower for redundancy the blowers serve a main header which splits into two header pipes each controlled by an automatic valve and followed by four manual zone valves the sensors for on line measurements of dissolved oxygen do are currently placed at the end of the biological reactors aer4 the air supply blower set is controlled by the average do of both lanes by varying the speed and guide vanes of the blowers fig 2 signal the do measurement in each lane is used to manipulate the positions of the automatic main header valves a more detailed description of the plant is described in juan garcía et al 2018 where the baseline model is built and calibrated to be used in an energy audit the modeling platform simba was chosen due to its unique capabilities to simulate the full aeration system with mechanistic models schraa et al 2017 as demonstrated in juan garcía et al 2018 the aeration system design causes around 90 of the airflow to be directed towards the head of the plant a full layout is shown in the supplementary material figs a1 and a2 during a power outage the plant has back up generators to power the influent pumps 4 pumps of 55 kw each but recirculation pumps and blowers remain inactive a list with all the energy consumption of various equipment at the girona wrrf is available in the supplementary information table a2 3 2 approach following the proposed framework 3 2 1 project definition enhancing resilience against power outage the plant experiences occasional power outages as occurs in many wrrfs it relies on external sources of energy and building resilience against these events is a priority for the wrrf managers this study analyses the following i assess how much time the system can withstand critical equipment shut down ii prioritise further investments in back up energy iii develop a mitigation strategy in case of limited back up power supply for the blowers iv compare the total cost of the applied measures to the level of resilience that is deemed acceptable two sets of simulations were designed the first set carried out a scenario analysis on equipment shut down duration 6 12 24 48 h for blowers and recirculation pumps although the plant uses diffusers as the main source of mixing in the aeration basins if the aeration stops the real plant is equipped with low speed mixers which for the purposes of this study are assumed to be functional with a total energy consumption of 15 kw the second set simulates the plant during a 48 h power outage where an investment has been made in back up energy to power recirculation pumps and blowers the blower capacity is set to a minimum to preserve back up power and thus limit the necessary generators a scenario analysis is carried out on different strategies of airflow distribution using the manual valves as control handles 3 2 2 data collection plant dynamics were collected from a period between the 18th and the 20th of june 2017 it includes a period of dry weather data with detailed flow measurements every 15 min and a data campaign consisting of i online measurements of do in all reactors and nhx at the entrance of the biological treatment and aer2 ii composite sampling of influent and reactors 4 grab samples per day in all 7 reactors plus hourly samples in reactors ana1 and aer2 iii energy consumption monitoring iv scada system files with blower capacity monitoring v influent wastewater fractionation vi reject water fractionation vii plant laboratory analysis of 24 h composite effluent samples stress tests included a 30 min power outage in blowers and recirculation pumps a change in the valve opening of aer3 in one lane and a change of the controlled reactor from rear to head which includes lowering the do setpoint from 1 5 to 1 mg l 1 these tests are intended to collect system performance information against sudden changes fig 3 shows the plant performance during the stress tests over time figs a4 and a6 to a9 show the scada report during the power outage event for dissolved oxygen and blower capacity respectively table a3 shows all types of information collected source frequency and duration table a4 shows the mass balance obtained with the steady state model 3 2 3 plant model set up the calibrated baseline model in juan garcía et al 2018 which was implemented in the advanced modeling platform simba was upgraded to assess resilience whole plant modeling was needed as the sludge recirculation depends on intermittent pumping and the reject water constitutes up to 20 of the influent nutrient load and determines the hourly influent profile a tracer test using bromide was executed to define the number of cstrs and estimate the hydraulic retention time the analysis of the tracer test concluded that each line of the biological reactor could be modelled as a series of 8 cstrs the biokinetic model asm inctrl simba s in house model takes into account 2 step nitrification denitrification and bio p needed to model the nutrient removal capacity a dynamic airflow distribution sub model is used schraa et al 2017 that includes mechanistic sub models for blowers pipes fittings valves and diffusers and calculates pressure in every part of the aeration system a static model could not consider equipment limitations and operational settings necessary to assess the limited power back up and operational changes the air distribution model requires detailed system characteristics but very limited calibration results show that it can accurately simulate the airflow distribution and responds realistically to changes in operational settings and equipment failures of the aeration system an overview of the process and aeration model layout is available in figs a1 and a2 respectively aeration control was accounted for by means of pi or pid controllers settling is accounted for by a10 layer takacs model takacs et al 1991 clarifier model improved in simba by explicitly taking the sludge concentration of the lower layer into account to model the exchange streams between layers full details of this implementation are available in alex 2011 the n2 gas concentration and the sludge blanket level and concentration are monitored as indicators of clarifier breakdown the models for the stressors consist of power limitations and outages in various equipment created by adjusting the input and settings in the equipment model blocks the operator response to the stressor is simulated with slowly tuned controllers for i internal recirculation based on no3 concentration in the anoxic reactor ii do setpoint in the monitored reactor based on effluent ammonia iii wastage pump flow controlled by tss in aer4 settings for all pid controllers are available in the supplementary material table a1 the adaptation of operational settings by the operators facing stressors include the three described controllers plus automated changes in the position of the manual valves regulating the airflow in each scenario 3 2 4 calibration and validation with the baseline calibration already completed juan garcía et al 2018 this study calibrated the additional sub models described in 3 2 3 with a more exhaustive data campaign including stress tests described in 3 2 2 the model was calibrated without changing the bio kinetic model parameters which supports the validity of the predictions to calibrate against stressors the software was automated to recreate a 30 min power outage in all modelled equipment except influent pumps and mixers changes in manual valve position do setpoint and control do probe position were set to replicate those registered during the stress test experiment the goodness of fit of the kwh consumed by the blower in re calibration can be seen in fig 3 the goodness of fit of the ammonia calibration in reactors and the primary clarifier is shown in fig 4 to validate the model it was tested against the first dataset used in the data campaign from juan garcía et al 2018 the goodness of fit is shown in the supplementary material fig a3 errors between experimental and simulated data have been calculated for 4 different metrics following the methodology in hauduc et al 2015a results are presented in the supplementary material table a5 3 2 5 simulation and results set up a prior analysis showed that total nitrogen in the effluent tn is the most critical variable for compliance and therefore has been chosen as the main impacted variable to monitor the stressor fig 5 shows a graphical representation using the results for the dynamic simulation of the 12 h blower power outage table 3 contains a generic description of the metrics used applied to tn these are i rapidity time to recover a tn effluent concentration under compliance limits 10 mg l 1 since the start of the event fig 5 brown dashed line ii robustness loss max tn effluent concentration during stress event fig 5 green purple line iii global resilience index gri accumulated kg of nitrogen in the effluent above compliance limit fig 5 blue area normalized by recovery time this metric integrates both rapidity and robustness and acts as a measure of the adaptability of the plant to the stressor the first set of simulations carries out a scenario analysis on power outage duration for recirculation pumps and blowers independently during 6 12 24 and 48 h power outages the second set of simulations tests the following six scenarios of aeration settings table 4 4 results 4 1 equipment vulnerability assessment the main effect of a recirculation pump shutdown on performance is due to the accumulation of sludge in the clarifier this eventually causes loss of sludge to the effluent which progressively reduces all biological activity in the reactors up to 2 days the virtual clarifier showed no signs of breakdown i e rapid increase in sludge blanket only the 48 h outage showed significant loss of sludge and related long term impacts on treatment performance blower shutdown had a more immediate effect on effluent quality as the lack of oxygen completely stops aerobic activity the virtual plant entered noncompliance after 6 h of blower shut down compared to 12 h in case of pump recirculation shut down fig 6 results show that for all power outage durations both the maximum effluent tn robustness and total mass of nitrogen above compliance limits gri are larger in blower shut down scenarios than recirculation pump scenarios fig 6 centre right however the importance of blowers versus recirculation pumps is heavily influenced by the short term nature of the case study 2 days plant recovery was quick around 3 days from any equipment shutdown up to 2 days fig 6 left the virtual plant recovered almost at the same time regardless of the equipment affected although the recovery time seems to increase faster for recirculation pumps than for blowers the long term impacts of losing sludge are potentially larger than those caused by lack of aeration capacity whereas keeping up the recirculation pumps may prevent sludge loss however this is heavily influenced by settleability the svi will determine how effective preventing sludge loss through recirculation can be for this case study power outages in aeration equipment have a higher impact in resilience than recirculation pumps if only aeration is considered resilience could be enhanced by increasing the back up energy available for blowers which requires a generator of up to 230 kw to keep its full functionality if all equipment is considered the most cost efficient option is to run the plant with recirculation pumps and the blower at minimum capacity in this case the plant requires extra back up of 260 kw 218 increase a list of relevant equipment and its power consumption for the girona wrrf is available in the supplementary material table a2 4 2 resilience assessment of various aeration strategies with limited energy back up in case of limited energy back up the simulations show that scenarios which favour redirecting airflow towards the head of the plant favour head only head are less resilient than the base case fig 7 centre right in terms of robustness and gri the most resilient scenarios are favour rear and open valves redirecting airflow towards the rear of the plant seems to be beneficial but there is a turning point as shown by the poor performance in only rear rapidity is clearly governed by the dynamics of the influent fig 7 left the effluent of all scenarios returns to compliance almost at the same time which is when the flow and the load during the low peak period enter the reactors understanding the effect that airflow redirection has on process performance is only possible thanks to the dynamic air supply model which simulates the changes of pressure in each part of the piping system and calculates the airflow supplied to each reactor fig 8 shows the average oxygen effectively supplied to each aerated reactor otr minus the average oxygen used by the process our due to heavy diffuser tapering and the characteristics of the aeration system piping the plant airflow is mostly directed towards the first two reactors aer1 and 2 whereas aer3 is clearly lacking oxygen fig 8 base case open valves this creates an imbalance in air supply demand that is further accentuated in those scenarios where airflow is favoured towards the head of the plant favour head only head by closing the manual valves in reactors aer1 and aer2 it is possible to balance the airflow supply demand fig 8 favour rear this maximizes oxygen use and oxygen transfer driving force at the expense of increased system pressure when the manual valves in aer1 and aer2 are kept open to a minimum to maximise the resilience when the blower is run at limited capacity two strategies are available 1 optimize oxygen supply demand to maximise oxygen transfer driving force and 2 minimise system pressure to maximise blower performance the fact that similar effluent quality is obtained in the scenario that best balances airflow and the scenario that minimizes system pressure fig 8 suggests that in this case both factors have equal weight in plant performance however the strategies have competing system settings the first one requires closing the valves in the first two reactors to favour rear aeration the second requires opening all valves which redirects airflow towards the head but due to lower pressure drops in the piping network delivers more air 5 discussion 5 1 a framework for model based resilience assessment this paper proposes a framework for model based resilience assessment of water resource recovery facilities based on the gmp unified protocol rieger et al 2012 the guideline extension responds to the pressure on public utilities to prepare for climate change impacts and get more resilient tepes and neumann 2020 the framework has been tested against data from the girona wrrf catalonia spain in previous studies currie et al 2014 modelled a wrrf and considered historical equipment reliability data equipment configuration and criticality and insights from site personnel including aspects relating to maintenance spares and equipment reliability to define several scenarios which were then simulated this study did not place an emphasis on the wrrf design and operating characteristics data collection reconciliation calibration and validation currie et al 2014 sweetapple et al 2018 and sweetapple et al 2019 use a benchmark model jeppsson et al 2008 for their resilience assessments while the approach is fair to draw general conclusions on the resilience of a wrrf against different types of stressors it does not provide fit for purpose recommendations for a specific plant the work in the current study is valid for observed stressors which can be calibrated and validated and the model structure is updated to account for changes caused by the effect of stressors e g hydraulics and sludge settleability unobserved stressors require more expert knowledge to be set up as the effect cannot be validated which means there has to be an industry effort to validating models and procedures we already have a very good understanding how to model some of the stressors for example there are accepted mechanistic models for equipment and sensors but hydrodynamics and settling are two critical issues where community agreement on standard stressors needs to be attained part of these limitations might be compensated by the application of uncertainty assessments belia et al 2009 one of the greater challenges is to perform model based quantitative resilience assessment for stressors which rarely occur i e once in the entire lifespan existing models are valid under normal functioning of the wrrfs the capacity of existing wrrf models to describe system recovery after total breakdown remains untested such capabilities would be essential to study resilience of wrrfs against extreme events e g extensive flooding tornadoes wildfire where the plant undergoes total breakdown for such events there are no historical data to calibrate the model to properly describe the effects of that stressor hence the uncertainties are much higher 5 2 analysis of measures to enhance resilience assessment this study allowed establishing an energy backup which would allow enhancing resilience to a level of functionality that was considered acceptable by the plant operators while using a cost effective aeration system configuration and ensuring the recovery of the system in no later than 2 days the recommendations are specific for the girona wrrf in this scenario the stakeholders define a desired level of service e g the maxim number of days allows for system non compliance then run simulations to decide on where to invest more efficiently however this is dependent on the levels of functionality that a wrrf must maintain under stress conditions it may be impossible for the plant to maintain full compliance under a critical event in this case it could be possible to minimise the detrimental effect of the environment by focusing on plant resilience instead of solely effluent compliance if we accept that there are situations infrequently impacting treatment performance it could be beneficial to change our permit structure to allow for a certain number of situations where we accept a lower performance for a limited period of time in exchange for reduced environmental damage in the long term the findings of this work are in line with currie et al 2014 on the importance of blower failures on process performance yet this study focuses on power outage and identifies fall back strategies to overcome it sweetapple et al 2018 2019 focus on the relationship between resilience risk reliability and sustainability as concluded in the current study they claimed that methodologies up to date address only a small fraction of the possibilities of resilience and a more comprehensive assessment of a system s response to threats is necessary to provide a comprehensive understanding of risk and resilience 6 conclusion this work presents a framework which includes guidance on how to use activated sludge modeling for resilience assessment and puts it into context within the current best practice in activated sludge modeling rieger et al 2012 the framework is validated through an application of a model based resilience assessment against power outage at a full scale plant the existing back up system of the plant is designed to prevent flooding thus we have focused our analysis to treatment objectives beyond flood protection the most important conclusions are summarized as follows a framework and procedures for quantitative model based resilience assessment has been designed within the context of the gmp protocol including definitions of terminology an initial set of standard stressors and the models necessary to simulate them has been proposed to help utilities and modellers execute resilience assessments table 2 more work is needed to agree on a comprehensive list of stressors the case study showcases the applicability and usefulness of model based resilience assessment applied to power outages for a full framework on resilience assessment to be completed there needs to be industry consensus on what is considered an acceptable level of resilience and how it should be measured of all the power dependant equipment in a wrrf blowers caused the highest loss of resilience in the plant for short term power outages less than 24 h however the existing back up system is designed to prevent flooding of the plant and the sewer network a different result may be achieved if flood protection was included in the assessment increasing the power back up by 218 would allow the plant to run with recirculation pumps and blowers at minimum capacity during a power outage thus minimizing performance loss optimizing the trade off between oxygen needs and aeration system pressure can further enhance resilience further research is needed to establish if the permit structure should accommodate levels of functionality to account for stress events declaration of

16819,stabilization of urine with calcium hydroxide prevents enzymatic urea hydrolysis thus allowing for maximum nitrogen recovery the process also produces a calcium phosphate bi product which has value as a fertilizer however the treated solution is saturated with calcium that could ultimately result in calcium carbonate scaling of reverse osmosis membranes during urine concentration this would result in a decrease in maximum water removal and an increase in operational costs this study therefore investigated if bubbling air and carbon dioxide through stabilized urine could remove calcium ions as calcium carbonate the process was modelled to better understand the mechanisms controlling the reactions in the process the model was then used to determine the most cost and time efficient operating conditions calcium removal of between 85 98 was achieved at air flow rates of 1 5 to 9 l min 1 increasing the co2 concentration from 0 04 air to 1 decreased the reaction time from 20 5 h to 2 5 h but the cost of co2 outweighed the shorter operating time air bubbling was the more cost efficient option it was estimated that 95 of the calcium could be removed in 7 6 h at an air flow rate of 4 l min 1 l 1 of urine and at a cost of 0 65 m 3 it was also determined that even if the ph decreased to below 11 the urine remained stabilized and no enzymatic urea hydrolysis occurred graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords calcium carbonate calcium hydroxide membranes reverse osmosis scaling sequestration 1 introduction urine stabilization with calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 prevents urea loss randall et al 2016 and has the potential to maximize the recovery of key nutrients such as nitrogen urea phosphorus and potassium this stabilization method is useful because it can work effectively in waterless fertilizer producing urinals chipako and randall 2019 produces a calcium phosphate fertilizer meyer et al 2018 as an alternative to mined phosphorus rock cunha et al 2020 possibly inactivates pathogens at the high operating ph values simha et al 2018 is also relatively cheap and easy to operate and provides a passive dosing system through the addition of excess calcium hydroxide powder randall et al 2016 urine can also be stabilized by acidification ray et al 2018 electrochemically de paepe et al 2020 or by using natural inhibitors modolo et al 2015 to prevent the enzymatic degradation of urea and subsequent loss of nitrogen as ammonia gas once stabilized the treated urine should be ideally concentrated on site since it is predominantly 97 water putnam 1971 and it is often expensive to transport large volumes of liquid a treatment method that removes water whilst maximizing nutrient recovery is thus required chipako and randall 2020a concentrating stabilized urine would in theory produce a urea rich solution which could be used as a liquid fertilizer chipako and randall 2020b or it can be used as a source of urea for the production of bio bricks lambert and randall 2019 and other solid material reverse osmosis ro is a common method for removing water from various types of wastewaters and seawater with typical energy consumption of between 0 5 to 6 kwh m 3 depending on the type of feed water and technology used stillwell and webber 2016 researchers have also shown that ro is as an effective method to concentrate hydrolyzed urine ek et al 2006 and membranes can be regularly cleaned to remove any fouling caused by the organics present in human urine madaeni and mansourpanah 2004 however there are fundamental differences between hydrolyzed urine and stabilized urine in terms of composition and solution ph for example stabilized urine will have high concentrations of urea while hydrolyzed urine will have high concentrations of ammonium ions it is not clear to what extent these differences could present a challenge to ro whilst urine stabilization with ca oh 2 has many advantages there are consequences when using this method in conjunction with ro for water removal the major challenge with ro is the fact that membranes are prone to scaling greenlee et al 2009 a process where solid precipitates build up on the membrane surface once their solubility limit has been reached common scaling components such as phosphate based compounds would be prevented from forming or at least significantly reduced by filtering the urine after stabilization with ca oh 2 since up to 95 of the phosphate can be removed during this treatment process as calcium phosphate flanagan and randall 2018 calcium carbonate caco3 is an additional scaling component that could precipitate during the concentration of stabilized urine using ca oh 2 stabilized urine using this method is saturated with calcium 1000 1400 mg l 1 and has a high inherent ph 12 45 at 25 c randall et al 2016 which could be converted to caco3 in the presence of air which contains 0 04 carbon dioxide co2 samari et al 2020 the dissolution of co2 forms carbonate co3 2 ions due the high ph of stabilized urine and is described by eqs 1 to 3 1 c o 2 g h 2 o h 2 c o 3 a q 2 h 2 c o 3 h c o 3 h 3 h c o 3 c o 3 2 h 4 c a 2 a q c o 3 a q 2 c a c o 3 s the excess ca2 ions added during this stabilization method would react with the co3 2 ion to form caco3 as described in eq 4 caco3 is a sparingly soluble salt 14 25 mg l 1 at 25 c in water lide 2004 and therefore will easily precipitate mitsoyannis and saravacos 1977 also observed experimentally that ro membranes have a high co2 permeability forming caco3 scale on the membrane surface in addition the operating ph for most commercial polyamide and cellulose acetate membranes is between 2 and 11 below that of urine stabilized with ca oh 2 the high ph of stabilized urine could therefore reduce the life span of the membranes franks et al 2009 decreasing the concentration of calcium ions in solution would reduce the amount of caco3 that could form on ro membranes air bubbling has been shown as an effective method to reduce the calcium concentration in brackish water as a pre treatment step for ro hasson et al 2011 lisitsin et al 2008 touati et al 2018 the process works by producing caco3 as governed by eqs 1 to 4 researchers have also shown that bubbling pure co2 through a ca oh 2 solution can reduce the concentration of calcium in solution altiner 2018 bang et al 2011 hasson and co workers hasson et al 2011 were able to reduce the calcium concentration in brackish water by 70 to 213 mg l 1 in 2 hours with air bubbling enabling an increase in water recovery in an ro treatment process from 78 to 90 bang and co workers bang et al 2011 were able to reduce the concentration of calcium in a 0 1 m ca oh 2 slurry to 320 mg l 1 via bubbling with pure co2 at 0 1 l min 1 in the case of stabilized urine using ca oh 2 the addition of air or co2 would theoretically reduce the concentration of calcium in solution while also decreasing the ph the lower ph would thus be beneficial for prolonging the lifespan of the ro membrane however randall and co workers randall et al 2016 showed that a ph above 11 is required to prevent enzymatic urea hydrolysis it is not clear to what extent enzymatic urea hydrolysis could occur after a ph drop below 11 during air or co2 bubbling in addition any urea hydrolysis that might occur at lower ph values would be converted to free ammonia which is easily stripped during air bubbling campos et al 2013 thus resulting in nitrogen loss many studies have investigated methods to increase the rate of caco3 precipitation the overall process happens in two steps the dissolution of co2 eq 1 and the formation of caco3 eq 4 increasing the feed flowrate increases the rate of co2 dissolution altiner 2018 and bang and co workers bang et al 2011 investigated the carbonation of a ca oh 2 lime slurry altiner 2018 showed that increasing the co2 flowrate decreased the reaction time however at co2 flowrates above 3 l min 1 there was no significant decrease in reaction time observed in addition altiner 2018 observed that an increased co2 flowrate from 0 3 to 1 0 l min 1 reduced the amount of co2 reacted from 27 to 12 we hypothesize that this occurs because at certain flowrates the formation of caco3 becomes the limiting factor rather than the rate of co2 dissolution the precipitation of caco3 using air or calcium ions is not new but the application of this treatment method to stabilized urine has not been investigated before in addition a deeper understanding of the governing processes affecting the urine chemistry is currently lacking the aim of this research was therefore to investigate the feasibility of using air or co2 bubbling as a method to remove calcium from stabilized urine as a pre treatment step for ro as there are many benefits to stabilizing urine with ca oh 2 it was deemed important to find an effective pre treatment step to ensure that downstream ro processes would not be impacted by the scaling potential of this treatment method we also wanted to determine if a simulation could be used to better understand how the operating parameters flow rate and gaseous co2 concentration affected the kinetics of caco3 precipitation in stabilized urine it was important to determine if a decrease in the stabilized urine s ph would result in enzymatic urea hydrolysis finally we simulated the potential recovery rates of a ro process using this pre treatment step and calculated the preliminary operating costs of the treatment process 2 materials and methods 2 1 urine collection the urine used for this work was collected anonymously from men working and studying in the new engineering building at the university of cape town in south africa the urine was collected in novel fertilizer producing urinals flanagan and randall 2018 each 25 l urinal was pre dosed with 250 g of ca oh 2 kimix cape town south africa the urinals were manually mixed twice daily during the collection phase to ensure the solution ph was homogenous and above 12 after collection the stabilized urine was stored in sealed containers for no longer than one month which is consistent with the findings of randall et al 2016 who found that no urea hydrolysis had occurred after 27 days before the start of each experiment the urine temperature was increased to room temperature 20 c and then filtered in stages using a 1 l vacuum filtration setup with filter paper of pore size 8 10 µm ahlstrom munksjö helsinki finland and used on the same day of filtration this ensured the removal of excess ca oh 2 and other precipitates calcium phosphate and magnesium hydroxide that formed during the stabilization process while these solid components were not the focus of this study they could be used as an inorganic fertilizer meyer et al 2018 the urine composition for each experiment is given in table s1 2 2 experimental conditions a variety of experimental conditions were examined to determine their effect on the rate and extent of calcium removal table 1 summarizes the experimental conditions and aims for each experiment all experiments where run in triplicate urine compositions are however not consistent between experimental conditions due to limitations in urine collection and storage time 2 3 air and co2 bubbling experiments approximately 1 l of filtered stabilized urine was weighed and then added to a 1 l jacketed reaction vessel glasschem stellenbosch south africa which was open to the atmosphere the desired temperature was kept constant via a recirculation chiller mm series polyscience illinois usa using tap water as the coolant the solution was continuously mixed throughout the experiment with an overhead mechanical stirrer hei torque core heidolph instruments schwabach germany at 550 rpm a rushton impeller was used to ensure all solids present remained suspended for the duration of the experiment the equipment was also continuously weighed using a precision scale to account for any evaporation radwag ps 4500 x 2 precision scale radom poland a ph temperature probe h1 5221 hanna johannesburg south africa was fixed in the reaction vessel for continuous measurements and to track the extent of the reaction a 4 point calibration 4 01 7 01 10 01 and 12 45 of the ph probe was conducted before each experiment air aco 003 resun shenzhen china and 1 and 100 co2 gas afrox cape town south africa were bubbled through the urine at various flowrates see table 1 which were measured and controlled with a variable flowmeter lt 08a01 mv 0 5 10 l min 1 wet technologies strand south africa an air stone a 002 daro cape town south africa was used to reduce the bubble size and ensure a more even distribution the air co2 bubbling time varied based on the experimental conditions at the start of each experiment the bubbling process caused a foam to form to prevent the foam from overflowing from the reaction vessel the air flowrate was increased incrementally proportionally for each flowrate for the first 90 min of the experiment for the air bubbling when the solution ph reached 8 6 0 1 the reaction was determined to be complete and the air feed was switched off the exception was for experiment u1 where air bubbling was continued for an additional 18 h after the ph reached 8 6 to determine the effect on urea loss for 1 co2 the reaction was determined to be complete when the measured calcium concentration remained constant for 2 h the 100 co2 experiment was run for 8 h the ph was measured in 5 min intervals for experiments a1 a4 and u1 and every 1 min for c1 and every 1 s for c2 samples were taken periodically throughout the experiment to measure the calcium concentration at the end of each experiment the liquid was filtered the solids were collected on filter paper with a pore size of 1 2 μm ahlstrom munksjö helsinki finland and dried at 105 c for 3 h the solids were analyzed to confirm if caco3 had formed after each experiment all the equipment was cleaned with a 0 08 m hcl solution to remove any precipitates that had formed and then rinsed thoroughly with tap water 2 4 gas transfer and precipitation model the bubbling of air co2 through stabilized urine was modelled using a precipitation model developed and defined in detail by udert 2002 and further updated by brison 2016 using aquasim reichert 1994 the model makes use of solubility equilibria complex formation reactions and acid base reactions to calculate a state of thermodynamic equilibrium the rate at which calcium is converted to caco3 is dependent on a multitude of factors including the concentration of calcium and carbonate ions the air co2 flowrate temperature mass transfer of gas etc the rate of caco3 precipitation ca2 removal used in this model is described by eq 5 kazmierczak et al 1982 where x cac o 3 are the moles of caco3 precipitated k cac o 3 is the rate constant for caco3 precipitation d 1 ca2 and co3 2 are the activities of calcium and carbonate ions mol l 1 which is a function of their concentration p k s caco 3 is the solubility product of caco3 and v is the liquid volume in the reactor l the rate of formation of caco3 is therefore directly proportional to the concentration of ca 2 and co3 2 ions and the precipitation rate constant 5 d x cac o 3 dt k c a c o 3 c a 2 co 3 2 1 2 10 p k s caco 3 2 v the rate of co2 dissolution was modelled using eq 6 adapted from udert et al 2003 where q air is the air co2 flowrate l d 1 v is the liquid volume in the reactor l cco2 is the concentration of co2 in the inlet air flow mol l 1 s c o 2 is the co2 concentration in the liquid phase mol l 1 k l a c o 2 is the mass transfer coefficient d and h c o 2 is the henry constant for co2 in water molg molaq 1 it was assumed that henry s constant for co2 in water can also be applied to urine 6 v d s c o 2 dt q air c c o 2 h c o 2 s c o 2 1 exp k l a c o 2 v h c o 2 q air these two dynamic processes as well as enzymatic urea hydrolysis and ammonia volatilization were considered and adjusted to accurately simulate the bubbling air co2 through stabilized urine in this work chemical urea hydrolysis was not considered as the operating temperature of experiments conducted was less than 25 c and the rate of urea loss would have been negligible warner 1942 the dissociation constants for carbonic acid and bicarbonate were adjusted to account for the urine s salinity and temperature as determined by millero et al 2006 in addition creatinine was added to the model to account for the amino acids present in urine putnam 1971 the experimental data was used to fit the model and calibrate the unknown parameters k c a c o 3 and k l a c o 2 processes could then be switched on and off in the model to determine their effect once the simulation was determined to be an accurate representation of the experimental data a multitude of different operating conditions were investigated to determine the most cost efficient operating parameters the nash sutcliff model efficiency nse coefficient was used to determine the accuracy of the model additional information regarding the model improvements figure s4 and how differences in the urine composition affect the ph and calcium concentration figure s5 can be found in the supplementary information 2 5 water removal model to simulate the removal of water the mass of solids formed and the effect on the scaling index si of different species simulations were conducted using oli stream analyzer oli systems inc 2020 where si log iap ksp iap is the ionic activity product and ksp is the solubility product the mixed solvent electrolyte mse model was used since it has no limitation on the ionic strength of a solution the aerated urine was simulated by adding co2 to a stabilized urine solution until a ph of 8 5 was reached the solids were then removed from the stream to mimic filtration and then different amounts of water removal was simulated this mimicked what would happen in a ro process oli stream analyzer was also used to simulate the effect of sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and sodium carbonate na2co3 addition to stabilized urine 2 6 analytical methods the liquid samples were analyzed to determine the concentration of ca2 nh4 mg po4 3 cl k so4 2 and urea via colorimetric methods a thermo scientific gallery thermofisher scientific massachusetts united states was used to automate this process for samples analyzed for urea and ammonia if the ph was greater than 9 0 08 m hcl was used to reduce the ph to between 7 8 this prevented the volatilization of any ammonia present in the sample where necessary samples were diluted with deionized water all liquid samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm pore size filter before analysis nylon syringe filters membrane solutions washington usa and analyzed within 30 minutes of sampling the precipitate was analyzed via powder x ray diffraction xrd xrd analysis was performed on a d8 advance diffractometer bruker germany equipped with a position sensitive detector lynxeye in bragg brentano geometry power to the co anode was set at 35 kv and 40 ma the diffraction patterns were acquired in the 2θ range of 20 to 120 1 d 0 19 to 0 97 å 1 using a step size of 0 017 and with a time per step of 0 84 seconds the total scan time amounts to 1 h 57 min the diffraction pattern was compared to reference data files reported in an icdd database pdf 4 released in 2020 the crystallographic properties of the precipitate were characterized by a fei nova sem 230 equipped with an oxford x max eds detector oxford instruments england in addition an elemental analysis was used to characterize the precipitate make up using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds with the analysis carried out on the oxford inca software 3 results 3 1 effect of air flowrate and co2 concentration on the ph and calcium concentration the rate at which the ph and calcium concentration changes with time for different flowrates of air is shown in figure 1 the faster the air flowrate the quicker the ph and calcium concentration decreased however the marginal decrease in reaction time from a flow rate of 1 5 to 3 l min 1 was much greater than from 6 to 9 l min 1 figure 1b shows two distinct regions where the calcium concentration decreases and then remains constant the 9 l min 1 flowrate resulted in a ph of 8 5 and a concentration of 78 mg ca2 l 1 after 6 h the final calcium concentration ranged from 18 to 179 mg l 1 the deviation in the 1 5 l min 1 ph curve was due to a build up of calcite on the ph probe overnight the probe was cleaned and re calibrated at 20 h the experimentally determined ph and calcium concentration as a function of time for varying co2 concentration between 0 04 to 100 are shown in fig 1c and fig 1d with the time in log hours increasing the co2 concentration decreased the time required to reach the systems equilibrium ph from over 24 h with air to 1 h with 1 co2 and 5 min for 100 co2 the concentration of co2 that will dissolve in a liquid is governed by henry s law therefore an increase in co2 concentration in the air also defined the equilibrium ph the time required to reach a minimum calcium concentration was reduced to 1 h for 1 co2 however for 100 co2 there no significant calcium removal was observed the reason for this is explained in section 4 2 3 2 urea stability fig 2 a shows that the concentration of urea remained constant throughout the 30 hours of air bubbling of which for more than 24 h the ph was below the minimum threshold ph of 11 thus indicating that no significant urea loss had occurred during the experiment the concentration of free and saline ammonia decreased at the start of the experiment as it was stripped from solution fig 2b stabilized urine will have an initial concentration of ammonia however the concentration is typically less than 400 mg l 1 and is significantly less than the concentration present in hydrolyzed urine urine collection using this stabilization method in a fertilizer producing urinal flanagan and randall 2018 indicates that this initial loss of nitrogen as ammonia does not result in odor issues for the urinal user the concentration of ammonia after the initial stripping process remained constant further indicating that urea hydrolysis did not occur 3 3 analysis of precipitates the precipitate was analyzed via sem and xrd both of which confirmed the sample to be calcium carbonate the xrd analysis indicated that no other crystalline phase was present no calcium hydroxide was present in the precipitant the crystal morphology can be determined from sem imagery which can be found in the supplementary information sem showed that the particles exist in a cube like formation with a size range of approximately 2 5 µm figure s2 the regular cubic formation indicates that the calcium carbonate is in the form of calcite siva et al 2017 which is in agreement with the xrd analysis 3 4 model fit a comparison of the experimental and simulated ph and calcium data for 0 04 co2 a and b 1 co2 c and d and 100 co2 e and f is shown in fig 3 comparison of the experimental and simulated data and model calibration for different air flow rates can be found in fig s3 and the supplementary information in all cases the model captured the ph curve well with a nash sutcliff model efficiency nse coefficient greater than 0 96 the model also captured the calcium concentration well with an nse coefficient greater than 0 95 for all cases except for the 100 co2 curve where the nse coefficient was 14 in this case the model captures the trend where the calcium concentration decreases slightly in the first five minutes and then remains relatively constant but not the absolute values fig 3d 3 5 scaling potential after treatment the treated stabilized urine will be saturated with respect to caco3 after aerating it with air co2 as stated earlier caco3 is a common scaling component therefore it was important to determine how the caco3 present after air co2 bubbling would affect the operation of an ro process a simulation of how the scaling index si of caco3 increases as water is removed concentrated by ro for different urine compositions was therefore conducted shown in fig 4 a approximately 85 water removal could be achieved before a caco3 si of 1 2 is reached it is evident that the composition of urine does not have a significant impact on the si fig 4b shows the relationship between temperature and si as water is removed water removal was simulated at 20 25 and 30 c assuming air bubbling took place at 20 c followed by water removal at 25 c 20 25 and 15 c 20 15 it is evident that water removal at temperatures between 20 and 30 c does not resulting in significant variation in the si if water removal occurs at a higher temperature than the air bubbling step the solution is initially under saturated with respect to caco3 and over saturated if water removal occurs at a lower temperature than air bubbling however as water is removed the difference in si tends to the same value regardless of pre treatment and water removal temperature 4 discussion 4 1 model interpretation with 100 co2 the ph reached equilibrium after 5 min with the available flowmeter it was not possible to accurately measure a low enough co2 flow rate to determine how 100 co2 would affect the rate of calcium precipitation therefore an accurate precipitation rate constant for 100 co2 could not be determined via the model the model predicted that the precipitation rate constant for air and 1 co2 was 139 d 1 and 584 d 1 respectively el fil and manzola 2003 coupled air bubbling with seeding 0 1 mg l 1 in geothermal waters and determined the precipitation rate constant to be 138 d 1 this value is in agreement with this work velts et al 2011 investigated 5 co2 bubbling in an aqueous ca oh 2 solution and determined a precipitation rate constant of 777 d 1 whilst this work did not use a seeding technique and used 1 co2 rather than 5 the precipitation rate constants are comparable based on the nse coefficients it was determined that the model is sufficiently accurate to explain the underlying mechanisms occurring during the air co2 bubbling process furthermore the integrated model can be adapted to model urine evaporation processes microbial induced calcium carbonate precipitation and various kinetic aspects related to urine treatment and other wastewater systems 4 2 understanding the processes involved the model assumed that co2 dissolution caco3 precipitation and ammonia stripping were occurring and that the urea hydrolysis was negligible fig 5 a shows how the ph is affected if there is no co2 dissolution fig 5b shows the ph and calcium concentration assuming no caco3 precipitated fig 5c shows the ph and total ammoniacal nitrogen tan assuming there was no ammonia stripping and fig 5d shows the ph and tan assuming 0 2 mol d 1 of urea hydrolysis was occurring from fig 5a it is evident that co2 dissolution is the main controller of ph however caco3 precipitation and ammonia stripping will also affect the equilibrium ph but to a lesser extent fig 5b shows that if no caco3 precipitation occurs the ph will still decrease due to the addition of co2 however the equilibrium ph would be slightly higher due to the build up of carbonate ions that did not precipitate fig 5c shows that without ammonia stripping the ammonia concentration would remain constant until a ph of 9 25 this is the dissociation constant at which ammonia protonates to form ammonium resulting in the slight decrease in ammonia concentration the model predicts that if urea hydrolysis was occurring there would be an increase in the ammonia concentration observed the rate of co2 dissolution eq 6 is directly linked to three variables concentration of co2 in the air the air flow rate for a given reactor size and the mass transfer coefficient for each flow rate there will be a limiting value for the mass transfer coefficient where the exponent term tends to zero the concentration of carbonate ions is directly linked to the ph of a solution as the ph decreases below the salinity adjusted carbonate dissociation constant 9 35 millero et al 2006 the percentage inorganic carbon in the form of co3 2 will decrease thus reducing the driving force for the formation of caco3 as per equation 5 this explains the two distinct regions observed in fig 1b if co2 dissolves too quickly the ph will decrease below the carbonate dissociation constant before any caco3 can precipitate as observed with 100 co2 experimental data in the work of altiner 2018 bang et al 2011 bubbling 100 co2 through a ca oh 2 slurry was investigated in this case the precipitation of caco3 was observed and the calcium concentration was reduced from 20 000 to 160 mg l 1 bang et al 2011 the dissolution of excess ca oh 2 in the slurry acted as a buffer to maintain a high ph and thus ensured that the inorganic carbon remained in the form of carbonate thereby providing a driving force for the precipitation reaction in this current work no excess ca oh 2 was present to counter the ph decrease therefore if the ph decrease occurs faster than the precipitation reaction the extent of calcium removal would be limited fig 6 compares how different air flow rates affect the ph and calcium concentration for a given reactor size and assuming that the mass transfer coefficient is not limiting the mass transfer can be improved via mixing lisitsin et al 2008 or decreasing bubble size altiner 2018 bang et al 2011 to maximize surface area and bubble retention time at low flowrates and co2 concentrations the rate of co2 dissolution is the rate limiting step for caco3 precipitation the precipitation rate is faster than the addition of co3 2 ions to the system once the maximum co2 dissolution rate is achieved the formation of caco3 becomes the rate limiting step this is evident in fig 6b where at flowrates greater than 5 l min 1 there is no significant increase in the rate at which calcium is removed the rate of caco3 formation could be increased by increasing the operating temperature which would decrease the k s p c a c o 3 stumm and morgan 2012 or by adding seeds which would increase the k c a c o 3 el fil and manzola 2003 song et al 2006 the results ultimately show that it is important to have a rate of co3 2 formation greater than the precipitation rate of caco3 but the co2 dissolution rate should be small enough to allow for substantial calcium removal before the buffer capacity of the solution is depleted 4 3 urea stability during air bubbling after air bubbling the ph of the treated urine was 8 5 and thus below the threshold value of 11 randall et al 2016 which inhibits enzymatic urea hydrolysis however no significant hydrolysis occurred this is likely as a result of the following reasons there was a low concentration of urease or urease producing bacteria present were not fully reactivated in the first 24 h in addition all experiments were conducted at a temperature of 20 c which is too low for chemical hydrolysis to occur callahan et al 2005 as the air co2 bubbling would occur continuously and directly before ro as a pre treatment step it is unlikely that hydrolysis would occur and affect the recovery of urea 4 4 implications for a reverse osmosis process simulation of water removal via ro after treatment with air co2 bubbling showed that although the aerated urine is saturated with respect to caco3 scaling caused by caco3 might be delayed rahardianto et al 2008 observed that up to a si of 1 2 caco3 membrane scaling was undetected this occurs at a water removal of approximately 85 figure s6 in the supplementary information further confirms the importance of the pre treatment step by displaying the difference in the amounts of solids formed during water removal for the treated urine the simulation shows that only a small mass of solids would precipitate 60 mg up to a water removal of 90 this is significantly less than stabilized urine for 1 l of urine at a water removal of 50 1 07 g of solids would precipitate this would cause significant membrane scaling the potential risk of scaling could also be further reduced by adding an anti scalant but this might reduce the quality of the product produced this means that stabilizing fresh urine to first produce calcium phosphate and then bubbling co2 air through the treated urine to reduce the calcium concentration in solution could provide an effective pre treatment method for ro in addition the bubbling of air into stabilized urine could also provide an innovative method to sequester co2 aguilar 2012 for example approximately 1 32 kg co2 could be sequestered per m3 of stabilzied urine this will vary based on the initial calcium concentration though 4 5 design and economic considerations reverse osmosis processes produce a concentrated brine which has to be disposed of or treated separately at an additional cost mericq et al 2010 in contrast using ro to concentrate stabilized urine not only produces water but the process also has the potential to produce a valuable liquid fertilizer concentrate for example chipako and randall 2020b recently showed that a niche fertilizer product produced from a urine ro process would only have to be sold at 1 57 l to breakeven over a five year period assuming that the urine volume is concentrated by 80 to produce the fertilizer concentration 1 m3 of urine has a potential retail value of 314 however the process would also concentrate pharmaceuticals in the product stream whilst initial studies have shown minimal plant uptake of pharmaceuticals from urine based fertilizers de boer et al 2018 their impact on agriculture and public acceptance should still be considered promising methods for pharmaceutical degradation include advanced oxidation dodd et al 2008 uv and h2o2 combinations zhang et al 2015 or cavitation musmarra et al 2016 importantly the high retail value of the niche fertilizer could off set many of the treatment costs required for an integrated process 4 5 1 air bubbling cost vs operating time the power required for the air blower to treat 1 m3 of urine is a function of the air bubbling time and blower power kw the operating time was calculated from fig 6b and was determined as the time required for 95 calcium removal for each air flowrate the blower power requirements were calculated according to sierra et al 2008 and increased with increasing air flowrate with detailed calculations provided in the supplementary information fig 7 a compares the total cost and operating times required for each air flowrate as the air flow rate increases the marginal decrease in operating time also decreases therefore the optimum air flowrate is approximately 4 l min 1 l 1 urine after which the marginal increase in cost outweighs the marginal decrease in operating time at an air flowrate of 4 l min 1 l 1 urine the air bubbling would cost 0 65 m 3 and would require an operating time of approximately 7 6 h this analysis assumed optimum dissolution rates therefore when designing the full scale pre treatment system the reactor geometry would also need to be considered to optimize the co2 dissolution rate 4 5 2 air vs co2 enriched gas fig 7b compares the cost and operating time for different co2 concentrations at optimum operating conditions whilst the required operating time is significantly decreased by increasing the co2 concentration the cost is 2 35 times more when compared to air bubbling as co2 costs 0 97 kg air liquide cape town even if co2 is 100 efficient approximately 1 3 kg of co2 is required per m3 of urine resulting in a minimum cost of 1 27 m 3 urine which is double the cost of air bubbling further information regarding how flow rate and operating time impacts the costing for co2 can be found in the figure s6 an additional advantage of air bubbling to remove excess calcium is that it can be used to sequester co2 directly from the atmosphere aguilar 2012 the cost of the power requirements for air bubbling would account for 0 2 of the retail value of the final product based on fertilizer values calculated by chipako and randall chipako and randall 2020b future work should investigate the extent at which the pre treatment process does in fact reduce ro membrane scaling as well as the associated costs of the integrated process 4 5 3 alternative solutions to air bubbling alternatively rather than bubbling air co2 sodium bicarbonate nahco3 or sodium carbonate na2co3 could be added to the stabilized urine to remove calcium as caco3 a na2co3 fluidized bed crystallization process has the potential to remove 88 of the calcium from simulated hard water mahasti et al 2017 theoretically the concentration of calcium could be reduced to 10 3 mg l 1 with a dosage of 2 7 g nahco3 l 1 or reduced to 10 7 mg l 1 with a dosage of 3 4 g na2co3 l 1 figure s7 in the supplementary information this process would add unwanted sodium ions to the solution though which could limit the degree of concentration in the subsequent ro process the sodium concentration would increase approximately 30 with nahco3 addition and 59 with na2co3 addition whilst this may seem significant the total dissolved solids tds concentration of the stabilized urine is approximately 25 000 35 000 mg l 1 the addition of nahco3 or na2co3 would only increase the tds concentration by 2 8 or 5 6 respectively the additional sodium ions in the liquid fertilizer product produced from the ro process should also be considered and tested extensively on different crops in terms of costs at roughly 230 per ton for nahco3 alibaba com 2020a and 285 per ton for na2co3 alibaba com 2020b this treatment process would cost 0 62 m 3 for nahco3 and 0 97 m 3 for na2co3 this process costs approximately the same as air bubbling and is likely to be much quicker happening in minutes rather than hours this pre treatment step should therefore be investigated further as an alternative option to the one investigated in this study while also considering the chemical production and transportation cost and not just the salt cost furthermore the overall energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions to produce these salts should also be considered and compared to air bubbling for calcium removal 5 conclusions we have shown that air bubbling is an effective method for removing calcium ions from urine stabilized with calcium hydroxide removing between 85 98 of the calcium depending on the initial calcium concentration flowrate and operating time we determined that the rate of co2 dissolution is the key process controlling the ph of the solution and ultimately the calcium is removed as solid caco3 at low flowrates co2 dissolution was the rate limiting step whilst at high flowrates and or high co2 concentrations the fast ph decrease limited the precipitation of caco3 we also showed that even though the ph of the solution had dropped below the threshold ph for enzymatic urea hydrolysis to occur 11 no urea hydrolysis was detected mostly likely because the urease producing bacteria had been inhibited at the high initial ph values 12 5 and the reaction time was too fast through simulations we showed that after pre treatment with air bubbling 85 of the water could be removed from the urine before caco3 scaling would be detected however the exact nature of membrane scaling for the proposed process needs to be investigated further using a real ro system the cost of using air enriched with co2 was more than double compared to using an air blower whilst using higher concentrations of co2 resulted in a significant decrease in operating time it did not justify the overall operating cost the optimum operating condition was determined to be an air flow rate of 4 l min 1l 1 urine and an operating time of 7 6 hours at these conditions 95 of the calcium could be removed at a cost of 0 65 m 3 this represents only 0 2 of the retail value of a liquid

16819,stabilization of urine with calcium hydroxide prevents enzymatic urea hydrolysis thus allowing for maximum nitrogen recovery the process also produces a calcium phosphate bi product which has value as a fertilizer however the treated solution is saturated with calcium that could ultimately result in calcium carbonate scaling of reverse osmosis membranes during urine concentration this would result in a decrease in maximum water removal and an increase in operational costs this study therefore investigated if bubbling air and carbon dioxide through stabilized urine could remove calcium ions as calcium carbonate the process was modelled to better understand the mechanisms controlling the reactions in the process the model was then used to determine the most cost and time efficient operating conditions calcium removal of between 85 98 was achieved at air flow rates of 1 5 to 9 l min 1 increasing the co2 concentration from 0 04 air to 1 decreased the reaction time from 20 5 h to 2 5 h but the cost of co2 outweighed the shorter operating time air bubbling was the more cost efficient option it was estimated that 95 of the calcium could be removed in 7 6 h at an air flow rate of 4 l min 1 l 1 of urine and at a cost of 0 65 m 3 it was also determined that even if the ph decreased to below 11 the urine remained stabilized and no enzymatic urea hydrolysis occurred graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords calcium carbonate calcium hydroxide membranes reverse osmosis scaling sequestration 1 introduction urine stabilization with calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 prevents urea loss randall et al 2016 and has the potential to maximize the recovery of key nutrients such as nitrogen urea phosphorus and potassium this stabilization method is useful because it can work effectively in waterless fertilizer producing urinals chipako and randall 2019 produces a calcium phosphate fertilizer meyer et al 2018 as an alternative to mined phosphorus rock cunha et al 2020 possibly inactivates pathogens at the high operating ph values simha et al 2018 is also relatively cheap and easy to operate and provides a passive dosing system through the addition of excess calcium hydroxide powder randall et al 2016 urine can also be stabilized by acidification ray et al 2018 electrochemically de paepe et al 2020 or by using natural inhibitors modolo et al 2015 to prevent the enzymatic degradation of urea and subsequent loss of nitrogen as ammonia gas once stabilized the treated urine should be ideally concentrated on site since it is predominantly 97 water putnam 1971 and it is often expensive to transport large volumes of liquid a treatment method that removes water whilst maximizing nutrient recovery is thus required chipako and randall 2020a concentrating stabilized urine would in theory produce a urea rich solution which could be used as a liquid fertilizer chipako and randall 2020b or it can be used as a source of urea for the production of bio bricks lambert and randall 2019 and other solid material reverse osmosis ro is a common method for removing water from various types of wastewaters and seawater with typical energy consumption of between 0 5 to 6 kwh m 3 depending on the type of feed water and technology used stillwell and webber 2016 researchers have also shown that ro is as an effective method to concentrate hydrolyzed urine ek et al 2006 and membranes can be regularly cleaned to remove any fouling caused by the organics present in human urine madaeni and mansourpanah 2004 however there are fundamental differences between hydrolyzed urine and stabilized urine in terms of composition and solution ph for example stabilized urine will have high concentrations of urea while hydrolyzed urine will have high concentrations of ammonium ions it is not clear to what extent these differences could present a challenge to ro whilst urine stabilization with ca oh 2 has many advantages there are consequences when using this method in conjunction with ro for water removal the major challenge with ro is the fact that membranes are prone to scaling greenlee et al 2009 a process where solid precipitates build up on the membrane surface once their solubility limit has been reached common scaling components such as phosphate based compounds would be prevented from forming or at least significantly reduced by filtering the urine after stabilization with ca oh 2 since up to 95 of the phosphate can be removed during this treatment process as calcium phosphate flanagan and randall 2018 calcium carbonate caco3 is an additional scaling component that could precipitate during the concentration of stabilized urine using ca oh 2 stabilized urine using this method is saturated with calcium 1000 1400 mg l 1 and has a high inherent ph 12 45 at 25 c randall et al 2016 which could be converted to caco3 in the presence of air which contains 0 04 carbon dioxide co2 samari et al 2020 the dissolution of co2 forms carbonate co3 2 ions due the high ph of stabilized urine and is described by eqs 1 to 3 1 c o 2 g h 2 o h 2 c o 3 a q 2 h 2 c o 3 h c o 3 h 3 h c o 3 c o 3 2 h 4 c a 2 a q c o 3 a q 2 c a c o 3 s the excess ca2 ions added during this stabilization method would react with the co3 2 ion to form caco3 as described in eq 4 caco3 is a sparingly soluble salt 14 25 mg l 1 at 25 c in water lide 2004 and therefore will easily precipitate mitsoyannis and saravacos 1977 also observed experimentally that ro membranes have a high co2 permeability forming caco3 scale on the membrane surface in addition the operating ph for most commercial polyamide and cellulose acetate membranes is between 2 and 11 below that of urine stabilized with ca oh 2 the high ph of stabilized urine could therefore reduce the life span of the membranes franks et al 2009 decreasing the concentration of calcium ions in solution would reduce the amount of caco3 that could form on ro membranes air bubbling has been shown as an effective method to reduce the calcium concentration in brackish water as a pre treatment step for ro hasson et al 2011 lisitsin et al 2008 touati et al 2018 the process works by producing caco3 as governed by eqs 1 to 4 researchers have also shown that bubbling pure co2 through a ca oh 2 solution can reduce the concentration of calcium in solution altiner 2018 bang et al 2011 hasson and co workers hasson et al 2011 were able to reduce the calcium concentration in brackish water by 70 to 213 mg l 1 in 2 hours with air bubbling enabling an increase in water recovery in an ro treatment process from 78 to 90 bang and co workers bang et al 2011 were able to reduce the concentration of calcium in a 0 1 m ca oh 2 slurry to 320 mg l 1 via bubbling with pure co2 at 0 1 l min 1 in the case of stabilized urine using ca oh 2 the addition of air or co2 would theoretically reduce the concentration of calcium in solution while also decreasing the ph the lower ph would thus be beneficial for prolonging the lifespan of the ro membrane however randall and co workers randall et al 2016 showed that a ph above 11 is required to prevent enzymatic urea hydrolysis it is not clear to what extent enzymatic urea hydrolysis could occur after a ph drop below 11 during air or co2 bubbling in addition any urea hydrolysis that might occur at lower ph values would be converted to free ammonia which is easily stripped during air bubbling campos et al 2013 thus resulting in nitrogen loss many studies have investigated methods to increase the rate of caco3 precipitation the overall process happens in two steps the dissolution of co2 eq 1 and the formation of caco3 eq 4 increasing the feed flowrate increases the rate of co2 dissolution altiner 2018 and bang and co workers bang et al 2011 investigated the carbonation of a ca oh 2 lime slurry altiner 2018 showed that increasing the co2 flowrate decreased the reaction time however at co2 flowrates above 3 l min 1 there was no significant decrease in reaction time observed in addition altiner 2018 observed that an increased co2 flowrate from 0 3 to 1 0 l min 1 reduced the amount of co2 reacted from 27 to 12 we hypothesize that this occurs because at certain flowrates the formation of caco3 becomes the limiting factor rather than the rate of co2 dissolution the precipitation of caco3 using air or calcium ions is not new but the application of this treatment method to stabilized urine has not been investigated before in addition a deeper understanding of the governing processes affecting the urine chemistry is currently lacking the aim of this research was therefore to investigate the feasibility of using air or co2 bubbling as a method to remove calcium from stabilized urine as a pre treatment step for ro as there are many benefits to stabilizing urine with ca oh 2 it was deemed important to find an effective pre treatment step to ensure that downstream ro processes would not be impacted by the scaling potential of this treatment method we also wanted to determine if a simulation could be used to better understand how the operating parameters flow rate and gaseous co2 concentration affected the kinetics of caco3 precipitation in stabilized urine it was important to determine if a decrease in the stabilized urine s ph would result in enzymatic urea hydrolysis finally we simulated the potential recovery rates of a ro process using this pre treatment step and calculated the preliminary operating costs of the treatment process 2 materials and methods 2 1 urine collection the urine used for this work was collected anonymously from men working and studying in the new engineering building at the university of cape town in south africa the urine was collected in novel fertilizer producing urinals flanagan and randall 2018 each 25 l urinal was pre dosed with 250 g of ca oh 2 kimix cape town south africa the urinals were manually mixed twice daily during the collection phase to ensure the solution ph was homogenous and above 12 after collection the stabilized urine was stored in sealed containers for no longer than one month which is consistent with the findings of randall et al 2016 who found that no urea hydrolysis had occurred after 27 days before the start of each experiment the urine temperature was increased to room temperature 20 c and then filtered in stages using a 1 l vacuum filtration setup with filter paper of pore size 8 10 µm ahlstrom munksjö helsinki finland and used on the same day of filtration this ensured the removal of excess ca oh 2 and other precipitates calcium phosphate and magnesium hydroxide that formed during the stabilization process while these solid components were not the focus of this study they could be used as an inorganic fertilizer meyer et al 2018 the urine composition for each experiment is given in table s1 2 2 experimental conditions a variety of experimental conditions were examined to determine their effect on the rate and extent of calcium removal table 1 summarizes the experimental conditions and aims for each experiment all experiments where run in triplicate urine compositions are however not consistent between experimental conditions due to limitations in urine collection and storage time 2 3 air and co2 bubbling experiments approximately 1 l of filtered stabilized urine was weighed and then added to a 1 l jacketed reaction vessel glasschem stellenbosch south africa which was open to the atmosphere the desired temperature was kept constant via a recirculation chiller mm series polyscience illinois usa using tap water as the coolant the solution was continuously mixed throughout the experiment with an overhead mechanical stirrer hei torque core heidolph instruments schwabach germany at 550 rpm a rushton impeller was used to ensure all solids present remained suspended for the duration of the experiment the equipment was also continuously weighed using a precision scale to account for any evaporation radwag ps 4500 x 2 precision scale radom poland a ph temperature probe h1 5221 hanna johannesburg south africa was fixed in the reaction vessel for continuous measurements and to track the extent of the reaction a 4 point calibration 4 01 7 01 10 01 and 12 45 of the ph probe was conducted before each experiment air aco 003 resun shenzhen china and 1 and 100 co2 gas afrox cape town south africa were bubbled through the urine at various flowrates see table 1 which were measured and controlled with a variable flowmeter lt 08a01 mv 0 5 10 l min 1 wet technologies strand south africa an air stone a 002 daro cape town south africa was used to reduce the bubble size and ensure a more even distribution the air co2 bubbling time varied based on the experimental conditions at the start of each experiment the bubbling process caused a foam to form to prevent the foam from overflowing from the reaction vessel the air flowrate was increased incrementally proportionally for each flowrate for the first 90 min of the experiment for the air bubbling when the solution ph reached 8 6 0 1 the reaction was determined to be complete and the air feed was switched off the exception was for experiment u1 where air bubbling was continued for an additional 18 h after the ph reached 8 6 to determine the effect on urea loss for 1 co2 the reaction was determined to be complete when the measured calcium concentration remained constant for 2 h the 100 co2 experiment was run for 8 h the ph was measured in 5 min intervals for experiments a1 a4 and u1 and every 1 min for c1 and every 1 s for c2 samples were taken periodically throughout the experiment to measure the calcium concentration at the end of each experiment the liquid was filtered the solids were collected on filter paper with a pore size of 1 2 μm ahlstrom munksjö helsinki finland and dried at 105 c for 3 h the solids were analyzed to confirm if caco3 had formed after each experiment all the equipment was cleaned with a 0 08 m hcl solution to remove any precipitates that had formed and then rinsed thoroughly with tap water 2 4 gas transfer and precipitation model the bubbling of air co2 through stabilized urine was modelled using a precipitation model developed and defined in detail by udert 2002 and further updated by brison 2016 using aquasim reichert 1994 the model makes use of solubility equilibria complex formation reactions and acid base reactions to calculate a state of thermodynamic equilibrium the rate at which calcium is converted to caco3 is dependent on a multitude of factors including the concentration of calcium and carbonate ions the air co2 flowrate temperature mass transfer of gas etc the rate of caco3 precipitation ca2 removal used in this model is described by eq 5 kazmierczak et al 1982 where x cac o 3 are the moles of caco3 precipitated k cac o 3 is the rate constant for caco3 precipitation d 1 ca2 and co3 2 are the activities of calcium and carbonate ions mol l 1 which is a function of their concentration p k s caco 3 is the solubility product of caco3 and v is the liquid volume in the reactor l the rate of formation of caco3 is therefore directly proportional to the concentration of ca 2 and co3 2 ions and the precipitation rate constant 5 d x cac o 3 dt k c a c o 3 c a 2 co 3 2 1 2 10 p k s caco 3 2 v the rate of co2 dissolution was modelled using eq 6 adapted from udert et al 2003 where q air is the air co2 flowrate l d 1 v is the liquid volume in the reactor l cco2 is the concentration of co2 in the inlet air flow mol l 1 s c o 2 is the co2 concentration in the liquid phase mol l 1 k l a c o 2 is the mass transfer coefficient d and h c o 2 is the henry constant for co2 in water molg molaq 1 it was assumed that henry s constant for co2 in water can also be applied to urine 6 v d s c o 2 dt q air c c o 2 h c o 2 s c o 2 1 exp k l a c o 2 v h c o 2 q air these two dynamic processes as well as enzymatic urea hydrolysis and ammonia volatilization were considered and adjusted to accurately simulate the bubbling air co2 through stabilized urine in this work chemical urea hydrolysis was not considered as the operating temperature of experiments conducted was less than 25 c and the rate of urea loss would have been negligible warner 1942 the dissociation constants for carbonic acid and bicarbonate were adjusted to account for the urine s salinity and temperature as determined by millero et al 2006 in addition creatinine was added to the model to account for the amino acids present in urine putnam 1971 the experimental data was used to fit the model and calibrate the unknown parameters k c a c o 3 and k l a c o 2 processes could then be switched on and off in the model to determine their effect once the simulation was determined to be an accurate representation of the experimental data a multitude of different operating conditions were investigated to determine the most cost efficient operating parameters the nash sutcliff model efficiency nse coefficient was used to determine the accuracy of the model additional information regarding the model improvements figure s4 and how differences in the urine composition affect the ph and calcium concentration figure s5 can be found in the supplementary information 2 5 water removal model to simulate the removal of water the mass of solids formed and the effect on the scaling index si of different species simulations were conducted using oli stream analyzer oli systems inc 2020 where si log iap ksp iap is the ionic activity product and ksp is the solubility product the mixed solvent electrolyte mse model was used since it has no limitation on the ionic strength of a solution the aerated urine was simulated by adding co2 to a stabilized urine solution until a ph of 8 5 was reached the solids were then removed from the stream to mimic filtration and then different amounts of water removal was simulated this mimicked what would happen in a ro process oli stream analyzer was also used to simulate the effect of sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and sodium carbonate na2co3 addition to stabilized urine 2 6 analytical methods the liquid samples were analyzed to determine the concentration of ca2 nh4 mg po4 3 cl k so4 2 and urea via colorimetric methods a thermo scientific gallery thermofisher scientific massachusetts united states was used to automate this process for samples analyzed for urea and ammonia if the ph was greater than 9 0 08 m hcl was used to reduce the ph to between 7 8 this prevented the volatilization of any ammonia present in the sample where necessary samples were diluted with deionized water all liquid samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm pore size filter before analysis nylon syringe filters membrane solutions washington usa and analyzed within 30 minutes of sampling the precipitate was analyzed via powder x ray diffraction xrd xrd analysis was performed on a d8 advance diffractometer bruker germany equipped with a position sensitive detector lynxeye in bragg brentano geometry power to the co anode was set at 35 kv and 40 ma the diffraction patterns were acquired in the 2θ range of 20 to 120 1 d 0 19 to 0 97 å 1 using a step size of 0 017 and with a time per step of 0 84 seconds the total scan time amounts to 1 h 57 min the diffraction pattern was compared to reference data files reported in an icdd database pdf 4 released in 2020 the crystallographic properties of the precipitate were characterized by a fei nova sem 230 equipped with an oxford x max eds detector oxford instruments england in addition an elemental analysis was used to characterize the precipitate make up using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds with the analysis carried out on the oxford inca software 3 results 3 1 effect of air flowrate and co2 concentration on the ph and calcium concentration the rate at which the ph and calcium concentration changes with time for different flowrates of air is shown in figure 1 the faster the air flowrate the quicker the ph and calcium concentration decreased however the marginal decrease in reaction time from a flow rate of 1 5 to 3 l min 1 was much greater than from 6 to 9 l min 1 figure 1b shows two distinct regions where the calcium concentration decreases and then remains constant the 9 l min 1 flowrate resulted in a ph of 8 5 and a concentration of 78 mg ca2 l 1 after 6 h the final calcium concentration ranged from 18 to 179 mg l 1 the deviation in the 1 5 l min 1 ph curve was due to a build up of calcite on the ph probe overnight the probe was cleaned and re calibrated at 20 h the experimentally determined ph and calcium concentration as a function of time for varying co2 concentration between 0 04 to 100 are shown in fig 1c and fig 1d with the time in log hours increasing the co2 concentration decreased the time required to reach the systems equilibrium ph from over 24 h with air to 1 h with 1 co2 and 5 min for 100 co2 the concentration of co2 that will dissolve in a liquid is governed by henry s law therefore an increase in co2 concentration in the air also defined the equilibrium ph the time required to reach a minimum calcium concentration was reduced to 1 h for 1 co2 however for 100 co2 there no significant calcium removal was observed the reason for this is explained in section 4 2 3 2 urea stability fig 2 a shows that the concentration of urea remained constant throughout the 30 hours of air bubbling of which for more than 24 h the ph was below the minimum threshold ph of 11 thus indicating that no significant urea loss had occurred during the experiment the concentration of free and saline ammonia decreased at the start of the experiment as it was stripped from solution fig 2b stabilized urine will have an initial concentration of ammonia however the concentration is typically less than 400 mg l 1 and is significantly less than the concentration present in hydrolyzed urine urine collection using this stabilization method in a fertilizer producing urinal flanagan and randall 2018 indicates that this initial loss of nitrogen as ammonia does not result in odor issues for the urinal user the concentration of ammonia after the initial stripping process remained constant further indicating that urea hydrolysis did not occur 3 3 analysis of precipitates the precipitate was analyzed via sem and xrd both of which confirmed the sample to be calcium carbonate the xrd analysis indicated that no other crystalline phase was present no calcium hydroxide was present in the precipitant the crystal morphology can be determined from sem imagery which can be found in the supplementary information sem showed that the particles exist in a cube like formation with a size range of approximately 2 5 µm figure s2 the regular cubic formation indicates that the calcium carbonate is in the form of calcite siva et al 2017 which is in agreement with the xrd analysis 3 4 model fit a comparison of the experimental and simulated ph and calcium data for 0 04 co2 a and b 1 co2 c and d and 100 co2 e and f is shown in fig 3 comparison of the experimental and simulated data and model calibration for different air flow rates can be found in fig s3 and the supplementary information in all cases the model captured the ph curve well with a nash sutcliff model efficiency nse coefficient greater than 0 96 the model also captured the calcium concentration well with an nse coefficient greater than 0 95 for all cases except for the 100 co2 curve where the nse coefficient was 14 in this case the model captures the trend where the calcium concentration decreases slightly in the first five minutes and then remains relatively constant but not the absolute values fig 3d 3 5 scaling potential after treatment the treated stabilized urine will be saturated with respect to caco3 after aerating it with air co2 as stated earlier caco3 is a common scaling component therefore it was important to determine how the caco3 present after air co2 bubbling would affect the operation of an ro process a simulation of how the scaling index si of caco3 increases as water is removed concentrated by ro for different urine compositions was therefore conducted shown in fig 4 a approximately 85 water removal could be achieved before a caco3 si of 1 2 is reached it is evident that the composition of urine does not have a significant impact on the si fig 4b shows the relationship between temperature and si as water is removed water removal was simulated at 20 25 and 30 c assuming air bubbling took place at 20 c followed by water removal at 25 c 20 25 and 15 c 20 15 it is evident that water removal at temperatures between 20 and 30 c does not resulting in significant variation in the si if water removal occurs at a higher temperature than the air bubbling step the solution is initially under saturated with respect to caco3 and over saturated if water removal occurs at a lower temperature than air bubbling however as water is removed the difference in si tends to the same value regardless of pre treatment and water removal temperature 4 discussion 4 1 model interpretation with 100 co2 the ph reached equilibrium after 5 min with the available flowmeter it was not possible to accurately measure a low enough co2 flow rate to determine how 100 co2 would affect the rate of calcium precipitation therefore an accurate precipitation rate constant for 100 co2 could not be determined via the model the model predicted that the precipitation rate constant for air and 1 co2 was 139 d 1 and 584 d 1 respectively el fil and manzola 2003 coupled air bubbling with seeding 0 1 mg l 1 in geothermal waters and determined the precipitation rate constant to be 138 d 1 this value is in agreement with this work velts et al 2011 investigated 5 co2 bubbling in an aqueous ca oh 2 solution and determined a precipitation rate constant of 777 d 1 whilst this work did not use a seeding technique and used 1 co2 rather than 5 the precipitation rate constants are comparable based on the nse coefficients it was determined that the model is sufficiently accurate to explain the underlying mechanisms occurring during the air co2 bubbling process furthermore the integrated model can be adapted to model urine evaporation processes microbial induced calcium carbonate precipitation and various kinetic aspects related to urine treatment and other wastewater systems 4 2 understanding the processes involved the model assumed that co2 dissolution caco3 precipitation and ammonia stripping were occurring and that the urea hydrolysis was negligible fig 5 a shows how the ph is affected if there is no co2 dissolution fig 5b shows the ph and calcium concentration assuming no caco3 precipitated fig 5c shows the ph and total ammoniacal nitrogen tan assuming there was no ammonia stripping and fig 5d shows the ph and tan assuming 0 2 mol d 1 of urea hydrolysis was occurring from fig 5a it is evident that co2 dissolution is the main controller of ph however caco3 precipitation and ammonia stripping will also affect the equilibrium ph but to a lesser extent fig 5b shows that if no caco3 precipitation occurs the ph will still decrease due to the addition of co2 however the equilibrium ph would be slightly higher due to the build up of carbonate ions that did not precipitate fig 5c shows that without ammonia stripping the ammonia concentration would remain constant until a ph of 9 25 this is the dissociation constant at which ammonia protonates to form ammonium resulting in the slight decrease in ammonia concentration the model predicts that if urea hydrolysis was occurring there would be an increase in the ammonia concentration observed the rate of co2 dissolution eq 6 is directly linked to three variables concentration of co2 in the air the air flow rate for a given reactor size and the mass transfer coefficient for each flow rate there will be a limiting value for the mass transfer coefficient where the exponent term tends to zero the concentration of carbonate ions is directly linked to the ph of a solution as the ph decreases below the salinity adjusted carbonate dissociation constant 9 35 millero et al 2006 the percentage inorganic carbon in the form of co3 2 will decrease thus reducing the driving force for the formation of caco3 as per equation 5 this explains the two distinct regions observed in fig 1b if co2 dissolves too quickly the ph will decrease below the carbonate dissociation constant before any caco3 can precipitate as observed with 100 co2 experimental data in the work of altiner 2018 bang et al 2011 bubbling 100 co2 through a ca oh 2 slurry was investigated in this case the precipitation of caco3 was observed and the calcium concentration was reduced from 20 000 to 160 mg l 1 bang et al 2011 the dissolution of excess ca oh 2 in the slurry acted as a buffer to maintain a high ph and thus ensured that the inorganic carbon remained in the form of carbonate thereby providing a driving force for the precipitation reaction in this current work no excess ca oh 2 was present to counter the ph decrease therefore if the ph decrease occurs faster than the precipitation reaction the extent of calcium removal would be limited fig 6 compares how different air flow rates affect the ph and calcium concentration for a given reactor size and assuming that the mass transfer coefficient is not limiting the mass transfer can be improved via mixing lisitsin et al 2008 or decreasing bubble size altiner 2018 bang et al 2011 to maximize surface area and bubble retention time at low flowrates and co2 concentrations the rate of co2 dissolution is the rate limiting step for caco3 precipitation the precipitation rate is faster than the addition of co3 2 ions to the system once the maximum co2 dissolution rate is achieved the formation of caco3 becomes the rate limiting step this is evident in fig 6b where at flowrates greater than 5 l min 1 there is no significant increase in the rate at which calcium is removed the rate of caco3 formation could be increased by increasing the operating temperature which would decrease the k s p c a c o 3 stumm and morgan 2012 or by adding seeds which would increase the k c a c o 3 el fil and manzola 2003 song et al 2006 the results ultimately show that it is important to have a rate of co3 2 formation greater than the precipitation rate of caco3 but the co2 dissolution rate should be small enough to allow for substantial calcium removal before the buffer capacity of the solution is depleted 4 3 urea stability during air bubbling after air bubbling the ph of the treated urine was 8 5 and thus below the threshold value of 11 randall et al 2016 which inhibits enzymatic urea hydrolysis however no significant hydrolysis occurred this is likely as a result of the following reasons there was a low concentration of urease or urease producing bacteria present were not fully reactivated in the first 24 h in addition all experiments were conducted at a temperature of 20 c which is too low for chemical hydrolysis to occur callahan et al 2005 as the air co2 bubbling would occur continuously and directly before ro as a pre treatment step it is unlikely that hydrolysis would occur and affect the recovery of urea 4 4 implications for a reverse osmosis process simulation of water removal via ro after treatment with air co2 bubbling showed that although the aerated urine is saturated with respect to caco3 scaling caused by caco3 might be delayed rahardianto et al 2008 observed that up to a si of 1 2 caco3 membrane scaling was undetected this occurs at a water removal of approximately 85 figure s6 in the supplementary information further confirms the importance of the pre treatment step by displaying the difference in the amounts of solids formed during water removal for the treated urine the simulation shows that only a small mass of solids would precipitate 60 mg up to a water removal of 90 this is significantly less than stabilized urine for 1 l of urine at a water removal of 50 1 07 g of solids would precipitate this would cause significant membrane scaling the potential risk of scaling could also be further reduced by adding an anti scalant but this might reduce the quality of the product produced this means that stabilizing fresh urine to first produce calcium phosphate and then bubbling co2 air through the treated urine to reduce the calcium concentration in solution could provide an effective pre treatment method for ro in addition the bubbling of air into stabilized urine could also provide an innovative method to sequester co2 aguilar 2012 for example approximately 1 32 kg co2 could be sequestered per m3 of stabilzied urine this will vary based on the initial calcium concentration though 4 5 design and economic considerations reverse osmosis processes produce a concentrated brine which has to be disposed of or treated separately at an additional cost mericq et al 2010 in contrast using ro to concentrate stabilized urine not only produces water but the process also has the potential to produce a valuable liquid fertilizer concentrate for example chipako and randall 2020b recently showed that a niche fertilizer product produced from a urine ro process would only have to be sold at 1 57 l to breakeven over a five year period assuming that the urine volume is concentrated by 80 to produce the fertilizer concentration 1 m3 of urine has a potential retail value of 314 however the process would also concentrate pharmaceuticals in the product stream whilst initial studies have shown minimal plant uptake of pharmaceuticals from urine based fertilizers de boer et al 2018 their impact on agriculture and public acceptance should still be considered promising methods for pharmaceutical degradation include advanced oxidation dodd et al 2008 uv and h2o2 combinations zhang et al 2015 or cavitation musmarra et al 2016 importantly the high retail value of the niche fertilizer could off set many of the treatment costs required for an integrated process 4 5 1 air bubbling cost vs operating time the power required for the air blower to treat 1 m3 of urine is a function of the air bubbling time and blower power kw the operating time was calculated from fig 6b and was determined as the time required for 95 calcium removal for each air flowrate the blower power requirements were calculated according to sierra et al 2008 and increased with increasing air flowrate with detailed calculations provided in the supplementary information fig 7 a compares the total cost and operating times required for each air flowrate as the air flow rate increases the marginal decrease in operating time also decreases therefore the optimum air flowrate is approximately 4 l min 1 l 1 urine after which the marginal increase in cost outweighs the marginal decrease in operating time at an air flowrate of 4 l min 1 l 1 urine the air bubbling would cost 0 65 m 3 and would require an operating time of approximately 7 6 h this analysis assumed optimum dissolution rates therefore when designing the full scale pre treatment system the reactor geometry would also need to be considered to optimize the co2 dissolution rate 4 5 2 air vs co2 enriched gas fig 7b compares the cost and operating time for different co2 concentrations at optimum operating conditions whilst the required operating time is significantly decreased by increasing the co2 concentration the cost is 2 35 times more when compared to air bubbling as co2 costs 0 97 kg air liquide cape town even if co2 is 100 efficient approximately 1 3 kg of co2 is required per m3 of urine resulting in a minimum cost of 1 27 m 3 urine which is double the cost of air bubbling further information regarding how flow rate and operating time impacts the costing for co2 can be found in the figure s6 an additional advantage of air bubbling to remove excess calcium is that it can be used to sequester co2 directly from the atmosphere aguilar 2012 the cost of the power requirements for air bubbling would account for 0 2 of the retail value of the final product based on fertilizer values calculated by chipako and randall chipako and randall 2020b future work should investigate the extent at which the pre treatment process does in fact reduce ro membrane scaling as well as the associated costs of the integrated process 4 5 3 alternative solutions to air bubbling alternatively rather than bubbling air co2 sodium bicarbonate nahco3 or sodium carbonate na2co3 could be added to the stabilized urine to remove calcium as caco3 a na2co3 fluidized bed crystallization process has the potential to remove 88 of the calcium from simulated hard water mahasti et al 2017 theoretically the concentration of calcium could be reduced to 10 3 mg l 1 with a dosage of 2 7 g nahco3 l 1 or reduced to 10 7 mg l 1 with a dosage of 3 4 g na2co3 l 1 figure s7 in the supplementary information this process would add unwanted sodium ions to the solution though which could limit the degree of concentration in the subsequent ro process the sodium concentration would increase approximately 30 with nahco3 addition and 59 with na2co3 addition whilst this may seem significant the total dissolved solids tds concentration of the stabilized urine is approximately 25 000 35 000 mg l 1 the addition of nahco3 or na2co3 would only increase the tds concentration by 2 8 or 5 6 respectively the additional sodium ions in the liquid fertilizer product produced from the ro process should also be considered and tested extensively on different crops in terms of costs at roughly 230 per ton for nahco3 alibaba com 2020a and 285 per ton for na2co3 alibaba com 2020b this treatment process would cost 0 62 m 3 for nahco3 and 0 97 m 3 for na2co3 this process costs approximately the same as air bubbling and is likely to be much quicker happening in minutes rather than hours this pre treatment step should therefore be investigated further as an alternative option to the one investigated in this study while also considering the chemical production and transportation cost and not just the salt cost furthermore the overall energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions to produce these salts should also be considered and compared to air bubbling for calcium removal 5 conclusions we have shown that air bubbling is an effective method for removing calcium ions from urine stabilized with calcium hydroxide removing between 85 98 of the calcium depending on the initial calcium concentration flowrate and operating time we determined that the rate of co2 dissolution is the key process controlling the ph of the solution and ultimately the calcium is removed as solid caco3 at low flowrates co2 dissolution was the rate limiting step whilst at high flowrates and or high co2 concentrations the fast ph decrease limited the precipitation of caco3 we also showed that even though the ph of the solution had dropped below the threshold ph for enzymatic urea hydrolysis to occur 11 no urea hydrolysis was detected mostly likely because the urease producing bacteria had been inhibited at the high initial ph values 12 5 and the reaction time was too fast through simulations we showed that after pre treatment with air bubbling 85 of the water could be removed from the urine before caco3 scaling would be detected however the exact nature of membrane scaling for the proposed process needs to be investigated further using a real ro system the cost of using air enriched with co2 was more than double compared to using an air blower whilst using higher concentrations of co2 resulted in a significant decrease in operating time it did not justify the overall operating cost the optimum operating condition was determined to be an air flow rate of 4 l min 1l 1 urine and an operating time of 7 6 hours at these conditions 95 of the calcium could be removed at a cost of 0 65 m 3 this represents only 0 2 of the retail value of a liquid
