quality provide habitat for aquatic organisms and increase channel bed and embankments stability arkema et al 2017 curran and hession 2013 huai et al 2021 juez et al 2019 nepf 2012 zhang et al 2020 the effects of riparian vegetation on hydraulic characteristics and ecological benefits of rivers are an indispensable part of river management camporeale et al 2013 and efforts are increasing to use natural riparian vegetation for ecological restoration of rivers and protection of embankments by utilizing real riparian vegetation fig 1 a riparian vegetation can also be planted on both sides of channels to improve river navigation when conditions are limited during dry seasons one example is the most important waterway in lithuania the nemunas river huai et al 2019b zdankus et al 2016 thus an in depth investigation on interactions between flow and riparian vegetation is essential for river management and aquatic biological ecosystem restoration camporeale et al 2013 wohl et al 2015 in recent years studies on vegetated channels have been widely conducted especially on the influences of riparian vegetation li et al 2022 liu et al 2022 the drag caused by vegetation reduces velocity in the vegetation zone which then increases in the main channel the lateral profile of velocity in a partially vegetated channel is shown in fig 1b the upper part is the partially vegetated channel based on the lateral profile the channel can be divided into three zones vegetation zone main channel and a shear layer sl between them white and nepf 2008 kelvin helmholtz k h instability triggered by the difference in velocity between vegetation zone and main channel causes coherent vortices resulting in violent turbulence in the sl li et al 2022 nezu and onitsuka 2001 in nature bed elevation of the main channel is usually lower than that of the vegetated zone which is called a vegetated compound channel lateral profile of velocity in the compound channel is also illustrated in fig 1b the lower part is the compound channel according to the profile the channel can be separated into floodplain main channel and mixing layer ml pasche and rouve 1985 momentum exchange occurs in the ml because of the combined effect of coherent vortex and bed morphology when a floodplain is fully covered with vegetation the relatively large lateral velocity gradient in the ml leads to momentum exchange that is violent with intense turbulence truong and uijttewaal 2019 at present most studies on vegetation have been carried out in compound channels with a fully vegetated floodplain and arrangement density and type of floodplain vegetation significantly affect velocity distribution and turbulence structure barman and kumar 2022 truong and uijttewaal 2019 in a study with partially vegetated floodplain the focus was on vegetation in the ml sun and shiono 2009 and velocity in the vegetated zone decreased significantly because of the drag effect resulting in a v shaped lateral profile of velocity momentum exchange occurs between low velocity flow in the vegetation zone and high velocity flow on both sides mulahasan et al 2017 sanjou and nezu 2010 owing to the irregularity and periodicity of turbulence turbulence structure is usually represented by turbulent characteristic quantities e g fluctuating velocity reynolds stress and momentum exchange in previous studies momentum exchange generated by coherent vortices is mainly represented by different characteristic events in the quadrant analysis method huai et al 2019b ejections and sweeps events dominate traditional two dimensional momentum exchange which mainly occurs in the sl or ml li et al 2020 truong and uijttewaal 2019 when a floodplain is partially vegetated by riparian plants fig 1a interactions may occur between coherent vortices in the sl and the ml within a certain distance which can affect velocity distribution and significantly change turbulence structure however distribution patterns of velocity and interactions of coherent vortices and effects on momentum exchange in a compound channel with varying coverage of vegetation on the floodplain remain unclear how do different characteristic events affect momentum exchange do ejections and sweeps events remain dominant in addition whether characteristic events of momentum exchange between the mixed layer and the sl are synchronized is unknown obviously these flow dynamics and turbulence structures are significant for the protection of bank and navigation and are also essential components for river eco geomorphology according to camporeale s model which demonstrates the importance of riparian vegetation dynamics e g turbulence structure secondary currents and topography camporeale et al 2013 in this study experiments were used to investigate flow dynamics and turbulence structures in a compound channel with varying coverage of riparian vegetation on the floodplain the lateral profile of velocity was analyzed then insights into lateral momentum exchange were obtained by analyzing reynolds stress and using spectral analysis and quadrant analysis in addition to contributing to the study of compound channels and the findings of this study can provide guidance for studies on morphology evolution scalar diffusion and channel navigation 2 experimental setup experiments were carried out in a recirculating flume 15 m length 1 3 m width 0 5 m depth with a 0 65 m width floodplain and main channel fig 2 a and 2b the bankfull height h was 8 cm fig 2c masses of 6 cm diameter polyvinyl chloride round pipes were utilized to stabilize the water at the entrance of the channel a splitter plate 1 0 m length was arranged at the entrance of the channel juez et al 2019 li et al 2022 in most studies barman and kumar 2022 li et al 2020 modeling aquatic vegetation as rigid cylinders is a common approach with rigid cylinders representing plants such as arbors or bulrushes in natural conditionse in this study cylinder height was 20 cm and diameter was 5 mm 0 2 mm the solid volume fraction was calculated as φ πmd 2 4 where d is the diameter of a cylinder and m is the number of cylinders per unit bed area cylinders were staggered at a spacing of 8 cm black symbols in fig 2d survey marks were shown in fig 2c and 2d red dots laterally the nonvegetated area of the floodplain and slope section were properly densified in the cross section because of the effect of coherent vortices the vertical survey marks were spaced at 1 cm when the depth of the floodplain was shallow the vertical space was reduced to ensure that there were at least three survey marks on each vertical line the vegetation was set 1 m from the entrance of the floodplain and the length of the vegetation zone was 12 m fig 2e the coordinate system was defined as x 0 at the leading edge of the vegetation zone y 0 at the edge of the floodplain near the bank and z 0 at the bed of the main channel fig 2c and 2e the x y and z axes corresponded to the streamwise lateral and vertical directions respectively simultaneous three component velocity u v w u v w and u v w are the time averaged velocity instantaneous velocity and fluctuation velocity in streamwise lateral and vertical direction respectively and they satisfy the relationships of u u u v v v and w w w a nortek acoustic doppler velocimeter adv was employed to obtain instantaneous velocity components in a compound channel with a sampling rate of 100 hz and a sampling time of 60 s explained below to obtain reasonable sampling rate and recording time three points y bf 0 55 y bf 1 and y bf 1 51 with z h 0 73 at the x 8 5 m cross section were selected to record 180 s with four sampling rates of 50 hz 100 hz 150 hz and 200 hz a pitot tube was also used to obtain a series of velocities at y bf 1 51 in the vertical direction which were compared with the data obtained from the adv top right box in fig 3 a velocity fluctuated strongly when the sampling rate was 150 hz and 200 hz whereas it fluctuated less with sampling rates of 100 hz and 50 hz with results closer to those of the pitot tube time required for the instantaneous velocity to reach stability was also different for the three locations considering the number of samples and recording time reasonable sampling time and sampling rate were set at 60 s and 100 hz respectively to improve reliability data with signal to noise ratios 15 and correlation coefficients 70 were filtered out the widely used phase space method goring and nikora 2002 was employed to optimize the velocity series velocity was measured at cross sections x 7 8 m x 8 5 m and x 9 2 m to determine the reasonable cross section measurement in case1 lateral profiles of time averaged velocity z h 0 73 and power spectrum density distributions y bf 1 z h 0 73 in three cross sections are illustrated in fig 3b velocity profile of the three cross sections remained almost the same and the power spectral density psd showed only one peak with almost the same frequency indicating that the flow reached a stable development region wang et al 2021 white and nepf 2007 therefore it was reasonable to conduct the investigation at the cross section x 8 5 m table 1 shows experimental arrangements and key parameters cases 1 to 4 indicate the varying coverage of floodplain riparian vegetation whereas nv case5 indicates the floodplain was not vegetated the parameter q is the discharge hmc is the height of main channel dr is the flow depth ratio of the relation dr hmc h hmc and bnv is the width of non vegetation on the floodplain reynolds number re and froude number fr were respectively obtained using the relations re u s r ν and fr u s gh where us r and h are the space average velocity hydraulic radius and water depth respectively and ν is the flow kinematic viscosity the solid volume fraction φ was 4 which approximated the density of tall riparian vegetation in nature according to a previous study white and nepf 2008 vegetation density affects the velocity distribution of flow and thus it affects also the horizontal momentum exchange between different zones of a compound channel in this work the effect of vegetation density was reflected in the size of related variables without changing the distribution of variables because this study primarily analyzed the effect of vegetation width on momentum exchange of channel flow detailed analysis of vegetation density was not conducted 3 calculation methods to facilitate the following analyses normalized reynolds stress u v u 2 was obtained by the friction velocity yang et al 2015 u g h mc s 0 where g is the gravitational acceleration and s 0 is the bed slope gradient depth averaged velocity ud 1 h 0 h u z d z and depth averaged normalized reynolds stresses u v u 2 d 1 h 0 h u v u 2 d z were employed in the analysis with water depth hmc h in the floodplain and hmc in the main channel the coherent vortices caused by k h instability dominate lateral momentum transfer leading to periodic fluctuations in velocity and reynolds stress truong et al 2019 the psd was obtained using the welch method in matlab and used to investigate the energy profile over the frequencies of the instantaneous lateral velocity v and identify the dominant frequency of the vortex that dominated the energy large scale coherent structures in the sl and the ml can be identified by the correlation of velocity with time proust et al 2017 the temporal autocorrelation function of lateral velocity fluctuations rvv was obtained using the following equation uijttewaal and booij 2000 1 r vv τ v t 0 v t 0 τ v 2 t 0 v 2 t 0 τ 0 5 where t 0 is a moment in time and τ is the time interval to analyze coherent structure four locations of y bf 0 31 0 55 1 00 and 1 46 with z h 0 73 at bnv h 4 were selected to represent the vegetation zone sl ml and main channel respectively the purpose of maintaining z h 0 73 which was close to the middle depth of the floodplain was to avoid the influences of bed and water surface during measurements quadrant analysis of reynolds stress can provide pivotal information on the contribution of various flow events to the momentum exchange mechanism lu and willmarth 1973 wallace 2016 in the present work quadrant analysis was performed to investigate the contributions of various events to the reynolds stress in a partially vegetated compound channel based on the sign of u and v reynolds stress is divided into four quadrants i outward interactions u 0 v 0 ii ejections u 0 v 0 iii inward interactions u 0 v 0 and iv sweeps u 0 v 0 willmarth and lu 1972 further distinguished the contributions in each quadrant using the hole domain which consists of four hyperbolas satisfying the relation u v h 0 u v where h 0 is the hole size that affects the contribution of each quadrant outside the hole to the total reynolds stress the contribution of various quadrants with a given hole size to the reynolds stress s i h 0 for different h 0 was obtained by the following equation lu and willmarth 1973 2 s i h 0 1 t 0 t c i h 0 t u t v t d t where i 1 2 3 and 4 t is the total sampling time and u t and v t are instantaneous fluctuation velocity that may vary with time in the streamwise and lateral directions respectively parameter c i h 0 was obtained using the following equation lu and willmarth 1973 3 c i h 0 1 u t v t h 0 u v and u t v t locates in the i th quadrant 0 otherwise according to eqs 2 and 3 s 1 h 0 and s 3 h 0 are positive but s 2 h 0 and s 4 h 0 are negative the contribution of four quadrants s i h 0 satisfies the relation i 1 4 s i h 0 u v 1 with h 0 0 4 results 4 1 streamwise velocity and reynolds stress the cross sectional profile of streamwise velocity u in all cases is shown in fig 4 velocity gradually increased from the floodplain to the main channel passing successively through the vegetation zone unvegetated floodplain and main channel velocity increased gradually from the bottom to the free surface in the compound channel except for the ml in the ml velocity first increased then decreased and last increased in case 2 to case 5 which is a pattern consistent with the result of a previous study kang and choi 2009 velocity in the ml first increased then decreased when the floodplain was fully vegetated i e case 1 which is consistent with the findings of yang et al 2007 to explain the results when the floodplain was partially vegetated there was a pair of obvious vortices in the ml but when the floodplain was fully vegetated the reverse vortex of the floodplain disappeared because of the superposition effect of sl and ml fig 4 the clockwise vortex in the main channel caused lateral momentum transfer from the floodplain into the main channel near the water surface and the counterclockwise vortex at the bottom increased resulting in the velocity profile in this study to better analyze the transverse profile of velocity in different cases the ud was employed fig 5 a the ud varied with the ratio of the width of the nonvegetated floodplain to the bankfull height bnv h and showed different distribution patterns traditionally there is an approximately uniform small velocity zone in the floodplain an approximately uniform large velocity zone in the main channel and a dramatical increase in velocity in the ml fig 1 in this study there was an approximately uniform section in the ml which was caused by the counterclockwise vortex at the edge of the floodplain when bnv h 4 and 6 velocity increased rapidly in both the floodplain and the interaction region between the floodplain and main channel i e sl and ml the reason for those results was that the difference in velocity between vegetated and nonvegetated regions on the floodplain triggered k h instability making the coherent vortex on the floodplain to promote momentum exchange between the two zones white and nepf 2008 in the ml it may be the result of the combined effect of horizontal coherent vortices and vertical secondary currents proust et al 2017 van prooijen et al 2005 when bnv h 0 and 2 the velocity profile was similar to the traditional pattern and the dud dy was a superimposed effect of coherent vortices in the sl and the ml the superposition effect likely developed because coherent vortices in the sl were strong and the sl and the ml were sufficiently close in distance such that there was less dissipation of the coherent vortices in the transfer process to the main channel the maximum value of u v u 2 was in the ml in the cases of bnv h 0 and nv and the crest value was in both sl and ml in the partially vegetated compound channel fig 4b there was almost no effect between the sl and the ml because of the sufficiently long distance between two when bnv h 6 but interactions between two gradually became significant as that distance decreased ultimately u v u 2 reached a maximum near the junction of the floodplain and the main channel when the floodplain was fully vegetated the lateral profile of u v u 2 d showed the same pattern fig 5c and the crest values of the sl were significantly greater than those of the ml which was related to plant density and bed morphology the u v u 2 d values of the vegetation zone and the stable zone of the main channel were close to zero indicating that almost no lateral momentum transfer occurred in those two regions the reasons for the results were that coherent vortices generated large dud dy in the sl and the ml which played a significant role at the peak of reynolds stress truong and uijttewaal 2019 van prooijen et al 2005 actually ejections and sweeps events which were the major contributors to the momentum transfer were primary in the sl and the ml in the analysis of the momentum transfer process detailed analysis in section 4 3 the coherent vortices generated in the sl were rapidly dissipated by collision with the vortex street during transmission in the vegetated zone the coherent vortices generated in the ml were subjected to the same gradual dissipation by the bed frictional force and the viscous force inside the flow during transmission thus the lateral momentum exchange was very feeble in the stable region of the main channel and the vegetation zone 4 2 power spectral density analysis as shown in fig 6 a the psd at y bf 0 31 0 55 and 1 0 showed significant peaks and the decay slope of the peaks was 3 indicating the existence of quasi 2 d coherent structures proust et al 2017 in the high frequency region the energy decay slope was 5 3 indicating that the flow here was in the inertial sub region li et al 2020 pope 2000 however the partial slope of energy decay in the later high frequency region approached 3 instead of exactly following the 5 3 slope when y bf 0 31 and 0 55 which is consistent with the findings of truong and uijttewaal 2019 the reason for the result might be that horizontal vortices including the karman vortex street caused by vegetation and coherent vortices collided with one another and with adjacent vegetation causing large scale vortices to break up and form more horizontal small scale vortices energy dissipation and increased number of vortices lead to reduced energy and increased vortex frequency moreover the relatively small reynolds number re of the vegetation zone resulting in a small inertial sub region range might also be a factor of influence profiles of rvv at different locations are shown in fig 6b the rvv decreased rapidly around τ 0 indicating small 3 d scales in the turbulence spectrum and then decreased slowly experiencing periodic fluctuations which indicated the 2 d coherent structure truong et al 2019 the vertical coordinates corresponding to the inflection points indicate the contribution of 2 d coherent structures to the normalized total turbulent kinetic energy uijttewaal and booij 2000 and the contribution of y bf 0 31 0 55 1 00 and 1 46 to the normalized total turbulent kinetic energy was 50 90 70 and 25 respectively moreover amplitudes of fluctuations at the positions y bf 0 55 and 1 0 were relatively large reflecting the larger scales of coherent structures in the sl and the ml the reason for the results might be the large velocity gradients in this study which can intensify the development of the coherent structure truong et al 2019 white and nepf 2007 in the vegetated region interactions between the vortices caused by vegetation and the coherent vortices caused the vortex to constantly break into small scale vortices and thus the fluctuant amplitude of the vegetation zone was smaller than that of the sl in the main channel stability zone the coherent structure decreased significantly because of the lack of sufficient support provided by the ml combined with effects of bed friction and flow viscosity uijttewaal and booij 2000 distinct peaks were found in different cases in the low frequency region and the decay slope behind the peak was 3 at bnv h 0 2 and 4 indicating large scale quasi 2 d coherent structures with a dominant frequency f 2 0 2 hz fig 6c and fig 6d in fact quasi 2 d coherent vortices and vertical vortices coexisted in the ml with the former is dominant resulting in a quasi 2d characteristic of the whole however for bnv h 6 and nv the effects of quasi 2 d coherent vortices and vertical vortices might have been more similar resulting in a 3 d characteristic in the ml with a dominant frequency f 1 0 13 hz knight 2013 4 3 quadrant analysis the low pass filtered signal curve was relatively smooth and obviously periodic which indicated large scale movement with low frequencies in the psd curve with green fluctuations around the blue line indicating high frequency movement in the psd curve fig 6a and fig 7 a lateral velocities v t and u v t were shifted and amplified respectively for clarity of view the u t and v t in the time series of velocity were correlated and sweeps and ejections events occurred periodically according to the u v t fluctuations in fact four events occurred alternately at any position with ejections and sweeps events occurring most of the time in the sl and the ml fig 7b an ejections event of the sl could occur simultaneously with each event of the ml as shown by the arrows in fig 7b among all events it synchronized with an ejections event of the ml most of the time approximately 64 moreover the peak value and period of u v t could also be different when sweeps events occurred at different times because the horizontal vortex stretched during the motion in this work sweeps events indicated transverse momentum entered the floodplain from the main channel but ejections events were reversed truong et al 2019 as shown in fig 8 u and v were almost evenly distributed in the four quadrants in the vegetation zone and the main channel indicating weak reynolds stress in those areas in the sl and the ml u and v were mainly distributed in quadrants ii and iv and the overall distribution shape was an inclined ellipse indicating that sweeps and ejections events were dominating truong and uijttewaal 2019 the vector in fig 8 shows the variation in fluctuation velocity in a period of the low pass filtered signal which is enlarged for clear observation with the orange arrow indicating the vector scale the fluctuation velocity vector did not close at the end of a cycle indicating that the quasi 2 d structure not pure 2 d motion was stretched during the motion the reasons for the stretching effect were various in different zones with the effect in vegetation zone sl and ml caused by the karman vortex street generated by surrounding vegetation the drag force effect of the vegetation and vertical secondary currents in the ml respectively when the distance between sl and ml was small enough coherent vortices in the respective regions might have also stretched because of mutual influence as bnv h increased the ellipse of the mixing region gradually decreased fig 9 a with the fluctuating amplitude of the fluctuation velocity decreasing which corresponds to fig 6d fig 9b shows the contributions of the hole region and each quadrant to the reynolds stress with varying hole size in the ml y bf 1 at bnv h 4 the role of the hole is to distinguish the large contributions in the quadrant by the hole size leaving the relatively small fluctuating u v signal in the hole for example when the contribution from the hole is small 15 it takes a relatively long time 50 the initial contributions of quadrants ii and iv were approximately 0 6 and 0 4 respectively whereas those of quadrants i and iii were negative and small as h 0 increased the contribution of each quadrant decreased but the contribution from the hole gradually increased when the contribution of quadrants i and iii was zero h 0 3 40 of the total reynolds stress was from the region out of the hole in quadrant iv whereas the fraction of contribution from quadrant ii was close to zero moreover only 7 of the total time was filled by the aforementioned events indicating that the sweeps event was fierce and brief at that intensity the depth averaged contribution of different quadrants to the reynolds stress with h 0 0 s i h 0 d was obtained by the relation s i h 0 d 1 h 0 h s i h 0 d z to characterize the lateral distribution of s i h 0 the lateral profile of s i 0 d with h 0 0 is shown in fig 10 sweeps and ejections events dominated in the entire section especially in the sl and the ml which is consistent with the findings of wang et al 2021 both s 2 0 d and s 4 0 d decreased with increasing bnv h in the sl and the ml but s 1 0 d and s 3 0 d remained in the range of 0 to 2 10 4 m2 s2 with small variations according to the aforementioned analysis sweeps and ejections events were dominant in magnitude size fig 10 the transverse distribution of s 2 0 d and s 4 0 d was similar to the transverse distribution of reynolds stress fig 5b which further indicated that the reynolds stress was mainly composed of s 2 0 and s 4 0 namely sweeps and ejections events were dominant 5 discussion velocity distribution and turbulence structure of a compound channel with varying width of the vegetation on the floodplain were studied in physical modeling experiments when there was partial vegetation on the floodplain the lateral distribution of velocity included two dramatically increasing segments and the lateral distribution of reynolds stress was bimodal which are features in contrast to the variable distributions of a traditional compound channel truong and uijttewaal 2019 van prooijen et al 2005 in the next step the coherent vortices that caused momentum exchange in the sl or the ml and the characteristic events during momentum exchange were analyzed the coherent vortices triggered by the difference in velocity in the sl not only increased the dominant frequency of the coherent vortices in the ml but also increased the coherent amplitude of those vortices which required a suitable distance fig 6 in the comparison of fig 4b and fig 6d the crest value of u v u 2 with bnv h 0 2 and 4 was distinctly larger than that with bnv h 6 and nv in the ml and there were quasi 2 d characteristics and large coherence amplitudes in the former the result indicated that large scale quasi 2 d structures significantly increased the reynolds stress which is consistent with the findings of proust et al 2017 quadrant analysis of reynolds stress was adopted to analyze various flow events contributions to the momentum exchange mechanism wallace 2016 percentage fractions of the four quadrants to the reynolds stress with h 0 0 s i 0 u v at the peak of the lateral profile in the ml or the sl are shown in fig 11 a percentages of both sweeps and ejections events were almost exceeded 50 whereas percentages of both outward interactions and inward interactions were 50 with most close to 20 in fig 11a investigations of li et al 2020 and huai et al 2019b were carried out in a rectangular channel partially covered with emergent vegetation and momentum exchange mainly occurred in the horizontal direction studies of huai et al 2019a and ghisalberti and nepf 2006 and fu et al 2020 were conducted in channels with submerged vegetation and floating vegetated islands respectively however common to all studies the momentum exchange had an obvious two dimensional character and the ejections and sweeps events were strong whereas the inward and outward interactions were weak by contrast the study of wang et al 2021 was carried out in a compound channel with ice cover and momentum exchange presented a three dimensional characteristic with relatively large outward interactions and inward interactions in the horizontal direction reasons for the differences were the vertical secondary flow in the ml for a relatively large water depth ratio dr and the ice covering the water surface which weakened the momentum exchange in the horizontal direction in the present work vertical secondary flow also occurred in the ml because the dr was close to 0 5 and the slope angle was 90 vegetation promoted momentum exchange in the horizontal direction and thus inward and outward interactions in this work were smaller than those of wang et al 2021 but larger than those of above mentioned li et al thus the ratio of sweep and ejection events to inward and outward interactions in this work was greater than that of wang et al 2021 and lower than that of other researchers in fig 11 this finding also indicates that channel morphology and vegetation have significant effects on momentum exchange considering the dominance of sweeps and ejections events further analysis was conducted fig 11b shows how brief but intense sweeps and ejections events contributed to momentum transfer y bf 1 z h 0 73 the parameter s h 0 is the proportion occupied by contributions of sweeps and ejections events from outside the hole and t h 0 is the proportion of sweeps and ejections events to the total time as follow ghisalberti and nepf 2006 4 s h 0 s 2 h 0 s 4 h 0 s 2 0 s 4 0 5 t h 0 1 t 0 t c 2 h 0 t c 4 h 0 t d t almost 80 of sweeps and ejections events occurred within 33 of the total time moreover when s h 0 1 and t h 0 0 75 indicating that sweeps and ejections events occupied 75 of the total time inward event and outward event interactions only occupied 25 of the time this conclusion is similar to the previous findings ghisalberti and nepf 2006 huai et al 2019b reynolds stresses were primarily affected by sweeps and ejections events because those events dominated in both occupancy time and fluctuation amplitude with the increase in bnv h both s 2 0 d and s 4 0 d distinctly decreased resulting in a decrease in reynolds stress because of alternating sweeps and ejections events both the sl and the ml exchanged momentum continuously as shown in fig 7b a sweeps event of the sl was not always been synchronized with that sweeps event of the ml but could occur simultaneously with each event of the ml owing to limited test conditions to ensure that the ratio between the width of the main channel and bankfull height was large enough an asymmetric channel was selected in this work therefore the findings of this study are applicable in asymmetric compound channels in a symmetrical channel the distribution of velocity and reynolds stress on the floodplain may be the same as mentioned above because they are mainly affected by vegetation on the floodplain and the distribution of related variables in the main channel may be different because the physical experiments have the advantage that flow is close to the natural state and the applicability of the turbulence model in computational fluid dynamics cfd needed to be verified only experimental research was conducted in the present work in future work a comparative analysis with the numerical simulation will be conducted for more detailed study it is worth noting that the anisotropy of channel flow should be considered in the selection of a suitable turbulence model in numerical calculations besides assumptions concerning water surface and channel boundaries also need to be considered furthermore to reduce inherent calculation error proper settings such as mesh size convergence criterion discrete methods and pressure velocity coupling algorithms should be the focus of attention 6 conclusions in this study experiments were carried out in a compound channel with varying coverage of floodplain riparian vegetation and corresponding flow dynamics and turbulence structures were analyzed based on the measured velocity the findings of this work are summarized as follows 1 the lateral distribution of velocity in a compound channel with partially vegetated floodplain had two dramatically increasing segments which is different from the velocity distribution in a traditional compound channel the results might provide a new analytical approach to study of the overflow capacity of such compound channels 2 reynolds stress mainly occurred in the sl and the ml resulting in the lateral distribution of reynolds stress with a bimodal characteristic in the compound channel with partially vegetated floodplain the crest values gradually decreased with increasing bnv h 3 large scale quasi 2 d coherent structures were found in the sl and the ml when bnv h 0 2 and 4 the coherent vortices in the sl increased both dominant frequency and coherent amplitude of the coherent vortices in the ml within a suitable distance the quadrant analysis revealed that ejections and sweeps events were dominant in the sl and the ml i e those events were the main contributors to reynolds stress with contributions exceeding 50 in almost all cases sweeps and ejections events were characterized by intense but brief duration with 80 of the momentum exchange completed in 33 of the time an ejections event of the sl could occur simultaneously with each event of the ml and was synchronized with an ejections event of the ml most of the time approximately 64 this work included preliminarily analyses of the velocity and turbulence structure in a partially vegetated compound channel the findings can be used as the hydraulic basis for the flow conveyance of a channel and can also provide guidance for studies on morphology evolution in the future the relation between width of riparian vegetation and flow conveyance of the channel needs to be established in addition the problem of sediment transport in a riverbed caused by vegetation should also be considered based on the above research initial guidance can be provided for the layout of vegetation in actual afforestation in that process the damage to bank by water should be reduced but the flow capacity of the channel and the integrity of the aquatic system should also be ensured data availability the data are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request credit authorship contribution statement jianmin zhang conceptualization methodology

1995,aquatic plants can alter flow structure affect sediment transport and contaminants diffusion and is noteworthy for channel restoration and navigation in the present work experiments are conducted to investigate the velocity and turbulence structures in a compound channel with varying coverage of riparian vegetation lateral profile of velocity may change from a traditional single sharply

quality provide habitat for aquatic organisms and increase channel bed and embankments stability arkema et al 2017 curran and hession 2013 huai et al 2021 juez et al 2019 nepf 2012 zhang et al 2020 the effects of riparian vegetation on hydraulic characteristics and ecological benefits of rivers are an indispensable part of river management camporeale et al 2013 and efforts are increasing to use natural riparian vegetation for ecological restoration of rivers and protection of embankments by utilizing real riparian vegetation fig 1 a riparian vegetation can also be planted on both sides of channels to improve river navigation when conditions are limited during dry seasons one example is the most important waterway in lithuania the nemunas river huai et al 2019b zdankus et al 2016 thus an in depth investigation on interactions between flow and riparian vegetation is essential for river management and aquatic biological ecosystem restoration camporeale et al 2013 wohl et al 2015 in recent years studies on vegetated channels have been widely conducted especially on the influences of riparian vegetation li et al 2022 liu et al 2022 the drag caused by vegetation reduces velocity in the vegetation zone which then increases in the main channel the lateral profile of velocity in a partially vegetated channel is shown in fig 1b the upper part is the partially vegetated channel based on the lateral profile the channel can be divided into three zones vegetation zone main channel and a shear layer sl between them white and nepf 2008 kelvin helmholtz k h instability triggered by the difference in velocity between vegetation zone and main channel causes coherent vortices resulting in violent turbulence in the sl li et al 2022 nezu and onitsuka 2001 in nature bed elevation of the main channel is usually lower than that of the vegetated zone which is called a vegetated compound channel lateral profile of velocity in the compound channel is also illustrated in fig 1b the lower part is the compound channel according to the profile the channel can be separated into floodplain main channel and mixing layer ml pasche and rouve 1985 momentum exchange occurs in the ml because of the combined effect of coherent vortex and bed morphology when a floodplain is fully covered with vegetation the relatively large lateral velocity gradient in the ml leads to momentum exchange that is violent with intense turbulence truong and uijttewaal 2019 at present most studies on vegetation have been carried out in compound channels with a fully vegetated floodplain and arrangement density and type of floodplain vegetation significantly affect velocity distribution and turbulence structure barman and kumar 2022 truong and uijttewaal 2019 in a study with partially vegetated floodplain the focus was on vegetation in the ml sun and shiono 2009 and velocity in the vegetated zone decreased significantly because of the drag effect resulting in a v shaped lateral profile of velocity momentum exchange occurs between low velocity flow in the vegetation zone and high velocity flow on both sides mulahasan et al 2017 sanjou and nezu 2010 owing to the irregularity and periodicity of turbulence turbulence structure is usually represented by turbulent characteristic quantities e g fluctuating velocity reynolds stress and momentum exchange in previous studies momentum exchange generated by coherent vortices is mainly represented by different characteristic events in the quadrant analysis method huai et al 2019b ejections and sweeps events dominate traditional two dimensional momentum exchange which mainly occurs in the sl or ml li et al 2020 truong and uijttewaal 2019 when a floodplain is partially vegetated by riparian plants fig 1a interactions may occur between coherent vortices in the sl and the ml within a certain distance which can affect velocity distribution and significantly change turbulence structure however distribution patterns of velocity and interactions of coherent vortices and effects on momentum exchange in a compound channel with varying coverage of vegetation on the floodplain remain unclear how do different characteristic events affect momentum exchange do ejections and sweeps events remain dominant in addition whether characteristic events of momentum exchange between the mixed layer and the sl are synchronized is unknown obviously these flow dynamics and turbulence structures are significant for the protection of bank and navigation and are also essential components for river eco geomorphology according to camporeale s model which demonstrates the importance of riparian vegetation dynamics e g turbulence structure secondary currents and topography camporeale et al 2013 in this study experiments were used to investigate flow dynamics and turbulence structures in a compound channel with varying coverage of riparian vegetation on the floodplain the lateral profile of velocity was analyzed then insights into lateral momentum exchange were obtained by analyzing reynolds stress and using spectral analysis and quadrant analysis in addition to contributing to the study of compound channels and the findings of this study can provide guidance for studies on morphology evolution scalar diffusion and channel navigation 2 experimental setup experiments were carried out in a recirculating flume 15 m length 1 3 m width 0 5 m depth with a 0 65 m width floodplain and main channel fig 2 a and 2b the bankfull height h was 8 cm fig 2c masses of 6 cm diameter polyvinyl chloride round pipes were utilized to stabilize the water at the entrance of the channel a splitter plate 1 0 m length was arranged at the entrance of the channel juez et al 2019 li et al 2022 in most studies barman and kumar 2022 li et al 2020 modeling aquatic vegetation as rigid cylinders is a common approach with rigid cylinders representing plants such as arbors or bulrushes in natural conditionse in this study cylinder height was 20 cm and diameter was 5 mm 0 2 mm the solid volume fraction was calculated as φ πmd 2 4 where d is the diameter of a cylinder and m is the number of cylinders per unit bed area cylinders were staggered at a spacing of 8 cm black symbols in fig 2d survey marks were shown in fig 2c and 2d red dots laterally the nonvegetated area of the floodplain and slope section were properly densified in the cross section because of the effect of coherent vortices the vertical survey marks were spaced at 1 cm when the depth of the floodplain was shallow the vertical space was reduced to ensure that there were at least three survey marks on each vertical line the vegetation was set 1 m from the entrance of the floodplain and the length of the vegetation zone was 12 m fig 2e the coordinate system was defined as x 0 at the leading edge of the vegetation zone y 0 at the edge of the floodplain near the bank and z 0 at the bed of the main channel fig 2c and 2e the x y and z axes corresponded to the streamwise lateral and vertical directions respectively simultaneous three component velocity u v w u v w and u v w are the time averaged velocity instantaneous velocity and fluctuation velocity in streamwise lateral and vertical direction respectively and they satisfy the relationships of u u u v v v and w w w a nortek acoustic doppler velocimeter adv was employed to obtain instantaneous velocity components in a compound channel with a sampling rate of 100 hz and a sampling time of 60 s explained below to obtain reasonable sampling rate and recording time three points y bf 0 55 y bf 1 and y bf 1 51 with z h 0 73 at the x 8 5 m cross section were selected to record 180 s with four sampling rates of 50 hz 100 hz 150 hz and 200 hz a pitot tube was also used to obtain a series of velocities at y bf 1 51 in the vertical direction which were compared with the data obtained from the adv top right box in fig 3 a velocity fluctuated strongly when the sampling rate was 150 hz and 200 hz whereas it fluctuated less with sampling rates of 100 hz and 50 hz with results closer to those of the pitot tube time required for the instantaneous velocity to reach stability was also different for the three locations considering the number of samples and recording time reasonable sampling time and sampling rate were set at 60 s and 100 hz respectively to improve reliability data with signal to noise ratios 15 and correlation coefficients 70 were filtered out the widely used phase space method goring and nikora 2002 was employed to optimize the velocity series velocity was measured at cross sections x 7 8 m x 8 5 m and x 9 2 m to determine the reasonable cross section measurement in case1 lateral profiles of time averaged velocity z h 0 73 and power spectrum density distributions y bf 1 z h 0 73 in three cross sections are illustrated in fig 3b velocity profile of the three cross sections remained almost the same and the power spectral density psd showed only one peak with almost the same frequency indicating that the flow reached a stable development region wang et al 2021 white and nepf 2007 therefore it was reasonable to conduct the investigation at the cross section x 8 5 m table 1 shows experimental arrangements and key parameters cases 1 to 4 indicate the varying coverage of floodplain riparian vegetation whereas nv case5 indicates the floodplain was not vegetated the parameter q is the discharge hmc is the height of main channel dr is the flow depth ratio of the relation dr hmc h hmc and bnv is the width of non vegetation on the floodplain reynolds number re and froude number fr were respectively obtained using the relations re u s r ν and fr u s gh where us r and h are the space average velocity hydraulic radius and water depth respectively and ν is the flow kinematic viscosity the solid volume fraction φ was 4 which approximated the density of tall riparian vegetation in nature according to a previous study white and nepf 2008 vegetation density affects the velocity distribution of flow and thus it affects also the horizontal momentum exchange between different zones of a compound channel in this work the effect of vegetation density was reflected in the size of related variables without changing the distribution of variables because this study primarily analyzed the effect of vegetation width on momentum exchange of channel flow detailed analysis of vegetation density was not conducted 3 calculation methods to facilitate the following analyses normalized reynolds stress u v u 2 was obtained by the friction velocity yang et al 2015 u g h mc s 0 where g is the gravitational acceleration and s 0 is the bed slope gradient depth averaged velocity ud 1 h 0 h u z d z and depth averaged normalized reynolds stresses u v u 2 d 1 h 0 h u v u 2 d z were employed in the analysis with water depth hmc h in the floodplain and hmc in the main channel the coherent vortices caused by k h instability dominate lateral momentum transfer leading to periodic fluctuations in velocity and reynolds stress truong et al 2019 the psd was obtained using the welch method in matlab and used to investigate the energy profile over the frequencies of the instantaneous lateral velocity v and identify the dominant frequency of the vortex that dominated the energy large scale coherent structures in the sl and the ml can be identified by the correlation of velocity with time proust et al 2017 the temporal autocorrelation function of lateral velocity fluctuations rvv was obtained using the following equation uijttewaal and booij 2000 1 r vv τ v t 0 v t 0 τ v 2 t 0 v 2 t 0 τ 0 5 where t 0 is a moment in time and τ is the time interval to analyze coherent structure four locations of y bf 0 31 0 55 1 00 and 1 46 with z h 0 73 at bnv h 4 were selected to represent the vegetation zone sl ml and main channel respectively the purpose of maintaining z h 0 73 which was close to the middle depth of the floodplain was to avoid the influences of bed and water surface during measurements quadrant analysis of reynolds stress can provide pivotal information on the contribution of various flow events to the momentum exchange mechanism lu and willmarth 1973 wallace 2016 in the present work quadrant analysis was performed to investigate the contributions of various events to the reynolds stress in a partially vegetated compound channel based on the sign of u and v reynolds stress is divided into four quadrants i outward interactions u 0 v 0 ii ejections u 0 v 0 iii inward interactions u 0 v 0 and iv sweeps u 0 v 0 willmarth and lu 1972 further distinguished the contributions in each quadrant using the hole domain which consists of four hyperbolas satisfying the relation u v h 0 u v where h 0 is the hole size that affects the contribution of each quadrant outside the hole to the total reynolds stress the contribution of various quadrants with a given hole size to the reynolds stress s i h 0 for different h 0 was obtained by the following equation lu and willmarth 1973 2 s i h 0 1 t 0 t c i h 0 t u t v t d t where i 1 2 3 and 4 t is the total sampling time and u t and v t are instantaneous fluctuation velocity that may vary with time in the streamwise and lateral directions respectively parameter c i h 0 was obtained using the following equation lu and willmarth 1973 3 c i h 0 1 u t v t h 0 u v and u t v t locates in the i th quadrant 0 otherwise according to eqs 2 and 3 s 1 h 0 and s 3 h 0 are positive but s 2 h 0 and s 4 h 0 are negative the contribution of four quadrants s i h 0 satisfies the relation i 1 4 s i h 0 u v 1 with h 0 0 4 results 4 1 streamwise velocity and reynolds stress the cross sectional profile of streamwise velocity u in all cases is shown in fig 4 velocity gradually increased from the floodplain to the main channel passing successively through the vegetation zone unvegetated floodplain and main channel velocity increased gradually from the bottom to the free surface in the compound channel except for the ml in the ml velocity first increased then decreased and last increased in case 2 to case 5 which is a pattern consistent with the result of a previous study kang and choi 2009 velocity in the ml first increased then decreased when the floodplain was fully vegetated i e case 1 which is consistent with the findings of yang et al 2007 to explain the results when the floodplain was partially vegetated there was a pair of obvious vortices in the ml but when the floodplain was fully vegetated the reverse vortex of the floodplain disappeared because of the superposition effect of sl and ml fig 4 the clockwise vortex in the main channel caused lateral momentum transfer from the floodplain into the main channel near the water surface and the counterclockwise vortex at the bottom increased resulting in the velocity profile in this study to better analyze the transverse profile of velocity in different cases the ud was employed fig 5 a the ud varied with the ratio of the width of the nonvegetated floodplain to the bankfull height bnv h and showed different distribution patterns traditionally there is an approximately uniform small velocity zone in the floodplain an approximately uniform large velocity zone in the main channel and a dramatical increase in velocity in the ml fig 1 in this study there was an approximately uniform section in the ml which was caused by the counterclockwise vortex at the edge of the floodplain when bnv h 4 and 6 velocity increased rapidly in both the floodplain and the interaction region between the floodplain and main channel i e sl and ml the reason for those results was that the difference in velocity between vegetated and nonvegetated regions on the floodplain triggered k h instability making the coherent vortex on the floodplain to promote momentum exchange between the two zones white and nepf 2008 in the ml it may be the result of the combined effect of horizontal coherent vortices and vertical secondary currents proust et al 2017 van prooijen et al 2005 when bnv h 0 and 2 the velocity profile was similar to the traditional pattern and the dud dy was a superimposed effect of coherent vortices in the sl and the ml the superposition effect likely developed because coherent vortices in the sl were strong and the sl and the ml were sufficiently close in distance such that there was less dissipation of the coherent vortices in the transfer process to the main channel the maximum value of u v u 2 was in the ml in the cases of bnv h 0 and nv and the crest value was in both sl and ml in the partially vegetated compound channel fig 4b there was almost no effect between the sl and the ml because of the sufficiently long distance between two when bnv h 6 but interactions between two gradually became significant as that distance decreased ultimately u v u 2 reached a maximum near the junction of the floodplain and the main channel when the floodplain was fully vegetated the lateral profile of u v u 2 d showed the same pattern fig 5c and the crest values of the sl were significantly greater than those of the ml which was related to plant density and bed morphology the u v u 2 d values of the vegetation zone and the stable zone of the main channel were close to zero indicating that almost no lateral momentum transfer occurred in those two regions the reasons for the results were that coherent vortices generated large dud dy in the sl and the ml which played a significant role at the peak of reynolds stress truong and uijttewaal 2019 van prooijen et al 2005 actually ejections and sweeps events which were the major contributors to the momentum transfer were primary in the sl and the ml in the analysis of the momentum transfer process detailed analysis in section 4 3 the coherent vortices generated in the sl were rapidly dissipated by collision with the vortex street during transmission in the vegetated zone the coherent vortices generated in the ml were subjected to the same gradual dissipation by the bed frictional force and the viscous force inside the flow during transmission thus the lateral momentum exchange was very feeble in the stable region of the main channel and the vegetation zone 4 2 power spectral density analysis as shown in fig 6 a the psd at y bf 0 31 0 55 and 1 0 showed significant peaks and the decay slope of the peaks was 3 indicating the existence of quasi 2 d coherent structures proust et al 2017 in the high frequency region the energy decay slope was 5 3 indicating that the flow here was in the inertial sub region li et al 2020 pope 2000 however the partial slope of energy decay in the later high frequency region approached 3 instead of exactly following the 5 3 slope when y bf 0 31 and 0 55 which is consistent with the findings of truong and uijttewaal 2019 the reason for the result might be that horizontal vortices including the karman vortex street caused by vegetation and coherent vortices collided with one another and with adjacent vegetation causing large scale vortices to break up and form more horizontal small scale vortices energy dissipation and increased number of vortices lead to reduced energy and increased vortex frequency moreover the relatively small reynolds number re of the vegetation zone resulting in a small inertial sub region range might also be a factor of influence profiles of rvv at different locations are shown in fig 6b the rvv decreased rapidly around τ 0 indicating small 3 d scales in the turbulence spectrum and then decreased slowly experiencing periodic fluctuations which indicated the 2 d coherent structure truong et al 2019 the vertical coordinates corresponding to the inflection points indicate the contribution of 2 d coherent structures to the normalized total turbulent kinetic energy uijttewaal and booij 2000 and the contribution of y bf 0 31 0 55 1 00 and 1 46 to the normalized total turbulent kinetic energy was 50 90 70 and 25 respectively moreover amplitudes of fluctuations at the positions y bf 0 55 and 1 0 were relatively large reflecting the larger scales of coherent structures in the sl and the ml the reason for the results might be the large velocity gradients in this study which can intensify the development of the coherent structure truong et al 2019 white and nepf 2007 in the vegetated region interactions between the vortices caused by vegetation and the coherent vortices caused the vortex to constantly break into small scale vortices and thus the fluctuant amplitude of the vegetation zone was smaller than that of the sl in the main channel stability zone the coherent structure decreased significantly because of the lack of sufficient support provided by the ml combined with effects of bed friction and flow viscosity uijttewaal and booij 2000 distinct peaks were found in different cases in the low frequency region and the decay slope behind the peak was 3 at bnv h 0 2 and 4 indicating large scale quasi 2 d coherent structures with a dominant frequency f 2 0 2 hz fig 6c and fig 6d in fact quasi 2 d coherent vortices and vertical vortices coexisted in the ml with the former is dominant resulting in a quasi 2d characteristic of the whole however for bnv h 6 and nv the effects of quasi 2 d coherent vortices and vertical vortices might have been more similar resulting in a 3 d characteristic in the ml with a dominant frequency f 1 0 13 hz knight 2013 4 3 quadrant analysis the low pass filtered signal curve was relatively smooth and obviously periodic which indicated large scale movement with low frequencies in the psd curve with green fluctuations around the blue line indicating high frequency movement in the psd curve fig 6a and fig 7 a lateral velocities v t and u v t were shifted and amplified respectively for clarity of view the u t and v t in the time series of velocity were correlated and sweeps and ejections events occurred periodically according to the u v t fluctuations in fact four events occurred alternately at any position with ejections and sweeps events occurring most of the time in the sl and the ml fig 7b an ejections event of the sl could occur simultaneously with each event of the ml as shown by the arrows in fig 7b among all events it synchronized with an ejections event of the ml most of the time approximately 64 moreover the peak value and period of u v t could also be different when sweeps events occurred at different times because the horizontal vortex stretched during the motion in this work sweeps events indicated transverse momentum entered the floodplain from the main channel but ejections events were reversed truong et al 2019 as shown in fig 8 u and v were almost evenly distributed in the four quadrants in the vegetation zone and the main channel indicating weak reynolds stress in those areas in the sl and the ml u and v were mainly distributed in quadrants ii and iv and the overall distribution shape was an inclined ellipse indicating that sweeps and ejections events were dominating truong and uijttewaal 2019 the vector in fig 8 shows the variation in fluctuation velocity in a period of the low pass filtered signal which is enlarged for clear observation with the orange arrow indicating the vector scale the fluctuation velocity vector did not close at the end of a cycle indicating that the quasi 2 d structure not pure 2 d motion was stretched during the motion the reasons for the stretching effect were various in different zones with the effect in vegetation zone sl and ml caused by the karman vortex street generated by surrounding vegetation the drag force effect of the vegetation and vertical secondary currents in the ml respectively when the distance between sl and ml was small enough coherent vortices in the respective regions might have also stretched because of mutual influence as bnv h increased the ellipse of the mixing region gradually decreased fig 9 a with the fluctuating amplitude of the fluctuation velocity decreasing which corresponds to fig 6d fig 9b shows the contributions of the hole region and each quadrant to the reynolds stress with varying hole size in the ml y bf 1 at bnv h 4 the role of the hole is to distinguish the large contributions in the quadrant by the hole size leaving the relatively small fluctuating u v signal in the hole for example when the contribution from the hole is small 15 it takes a relatively long time 50 the initial contributions of quadrants ii and iv were approximately 0 6 and 0 4 respectively whereas those of quadrants i and iii were negative and small as h 0 increased the contribution of each quadrant decreased but the contribution from the hole gradually increased when the contribution of quadrants i and iii was zero h 0 3 40 of the total reynolds stress was from the region out of the hole in quadrant iv whereas the fraction of contribution from quadrant ii was close to zero moreover only 7 of the total time was filled by the aforementioned events indicating that the sweeps event was fierce and brief at that intensity the depth averaged contribution of different quadrants to the reynolds stress with h 0 0 s i h 0 d was obtained by the relation s i h 0 d 1 h 0 h s i h 0 d z to characterize the lateral distribution of s i h 0 the lateral profile of s i 0 d with h 0 0 is shown in fig 10 sweeps and ejections events dominated in the entire section especially in the sl and the ml which is consistent with the findings of wang et al 2021 both s 2 0 d and s 4 0 d decreased with increasing bnv h in the sl and the ml but s 1 0 d and s 3 0 d remained in the range of 0 to 2 10 4 m2 s2 with small variations according to the aforementioned analysis sweeps and ejections events were dominant in magnitude size fig 10 the transverse distribution of s 2 0 d and s 4 0 d was similar to the transverse distribution of reynolds stress fig 5b which further indicated that the reynolds stress was mainly composed of s 2 0 and s 4 0 namely sweeps and ejections events were dominant 5 discussion velocity distribution and turbulence structure of a compound channel with varying width of the vegetation on the floodplain were studied in physical modeling experiments when there was partial vegetation on the floodplain the lateral distribution of velocity included two dramatically increasing segments and the lateral distribution of reynolds stress was bimodal which are features in contrast to the variable distributions of a traditional compound channel truong and uijttewaal 2019 van prooijen et al 2005 in the next step the coherent vortices that caused momentum exchange in the sl or the ml and the characteristic events during momentum exchange were analyzed the coherent vortices triggered by the difference in velocity in the sl not only increased the dominant frequency of the coherent vortices in the ml but also increased the coherent amplitude of those vortices which required a suitable distance fig 6 in the comparison of fig 4b and fig 6d the crest value of u v u 2 with bnv h 0 2 and 4 was distinctly larger than that with bnv h 6 and nv in the ml and there were quasi 2 d characteristics and large coherence amplitudes in the former the result indicated that large scale quasi 2 d structures significantly increased the reynolds stress which is consistent with the findings of proust et al 2017 quadrant analysis of reynolds stress was adopted to analyze various flow events contributions to the momentum exchange mechanism wallace 2016 percentage fractions of the four quadrants to the reynolds stress with h 0 0 s i 0 u v at the peak of the lateral profile in the ml or the sl are shown in fig 11 a percentages of both sweeps and ejections events were almost exceeded 50 whereas percentages of both outward interactions and inward interactions were 50 with most close to 20 in fig 11a investigations of li et al 2020 and huai et al 2019b were carried out in a rectangular channel partially covered with emergent vegetation and momentum exchange mainly occurred in the horizontal direction studies of huai et al 2019a and ghisalberti and nepf 2006 and fu et al 2020 were conducted in channels with submerged vegetation and floating vegetated islands respectively however common to all studies the momentum exchange had an obvious two dimensional character and the ejections and sweeps events were strong whereas the inward and outward interactions were weak by contrast the study of wang et al 2021 was carried out in a compound channel with ice cover and momentum exchange presented a three dimensional characteristic with relatively large outward interactions and inward interactions in the horizontal direction reasons for the differences were the vertical secondary flow in the ml for a relatively large water depth ratio dr and the ice covering the water surface which weakened the momentum exchange in the horizontal direction in the present work vertical secondary flow also occurred in the ml because the dr was close to 0 5 and the slope angle was 90 vegetation promoted momentum exchange in the horizontal direction and thus inward and outward interactions in this work were smaller than those of wang et al 2021 but larger than those of above mentioned li et al thus the ratio of sweep and ejection events to inward and outward interactions in this work was greater than that of wang et al 2021 and lower than that of other researchers in fig 11 this finding also indicates that channel morphology and vegetation have significant effects on momentum exchange considering the dominance of sweeps and ejections events further analysis was conducted fig 11b shows how brief but intense sweeps and ejections events contributed to momentum transfer y bf 1 z h 0 73 the parameter s h 0 is the proportion occupied by contributions of sweeps and ejections events from outside the hole and t h 0 is the proportion of sweeps and ejections events to the total time as follow ghisalberti and nepf 2006 4 s h 0 s 2 h 0 s 4 h 0 s 2 0 s 4 0 5 t h 0 1 t 0 t c 2 h 0 t c 4 h 0 t d t almost 80 of sweeps and ejections events occurred within 33 of the total time moreover when s h 0 1 and t h 0 0 75 indicating that sweeps and ejections events occupied 75 of the total time inward event and outward event interactions only occupied 25 of the time this conclusion is similar to the previous findings ghisalberti and nepf 2006 huai et al 2019b reynolds stresses were primarily affected by sweeps and ejections events because those events dominated in both occupancy time and fluctuation amplitude with the increase in bnv h both s 2 0 d and s 4 0 d distinctly decreased resulting in a decrease in reynolds stress because of alternating sweeps and ejections events both the sl and the ml exchanged momentum continuously as shown in fig 7b a sweeps event of the sl was not always been synchronized with that sweeps event of the ml but could occur simultaneously with each event of the ml owing to limited test conditions to ensure that the ratio between the width of the main channel and bankfull height was large enough an asymmetric channel was selected in this work therefore the findings of this study are applicable in asymmetric compound channels in a symmetrical channel the distribution of velocity and reynolds stress on the floodplain may be the same as mentioned above because they are mainly affected by vegetation on the floodplain and the distribution of related variables in the main channel may be different because the physical experiments have the advantage that flow is close to the natural state and the applicability of the turbulence model in computational fluid dynamics cfd needed to be verified only experimental research was conducted in the present work in future work a comparative analysis with the numerical simulation will be conducted for more detailed study it is worth noting that the anisotropy of channel flow should be considered in the selection of a suitable turbulence model in numerical calculations besides assumptions concerning water surface and channel boundaries also need to be considered furthermore to reduce inherent calculation error proper settings such as mesh size convergence criterion discrete methods and pressure velocity coupling algorithms should be the focus of attention 6 conclusions in this study experiments were carried out in a compound channel with varying coverage of floodplain riparian vegetation and corresponding flow dynamics and turbulence structures were analyzed based on the measured velocity the findings of this work are summarized as follows 1 the lateral distribution of velocity in a compound channel with partially vegetated floodplain had two dramatically increasing segments which is different from the velocity distribution in a traditional compound channel the results might provide a new analytical approach to study of the overflow capacity of such compound channels 2 reynolds stress mainly occurred in the sl and the ml resulting in the lateral distribution of reynolds stress with a bimodal characteristic in the compound channel with partially vegetated floodplain the crest values gradually decreased with increasing bnv h 3 large scale quasi 2 d coherent structures were found in the sl and the ml when bnv h 0 2 and 4 the coherent vortices in the sl increased both dominant frequency and coherent amplitude of the coherent vortices in the ml within a suitable distance the quadrant analysis revealed that ejections and sweeps events were dominant in the sl and the ml i e those events were the main contributors to reynolds stress with contributions exceeding 50 in almost all cases sweeps and ejections events were characterized by intense but brief duration with 80 of the momentum exchange completed in 33 of the time an ejections event of the sl could occur simultaneously with each event of the ml and was synchronized with an ejections event of the ml most of the time approximately 64 this work included preliminarily analyses of the velocity and turbulence structure in a partially vegetated compound channel the findings can be used as the hydraulic basis for the flow conveyance of a channel and can also provide guidance for studies on morphology evolution in the future the relation between width of riparian vegetation and flow conveyance of the

grey infrastructures implementation for addressing urban flood damages and urban drainage system uds resilience respectively needs comprehensive evaluation under various planning and design influencing factors in this paper a multi objective decision making framework is developed for the optimization of green grey infrastructures to understand the trade off between benefits and retrofit costs under various design configurations rainfall intensities and system performance indicators in the developed framework the grey infrastructure locations are optimally determined by using analytic hierarchy process ahp method with three defined indicators e g flood volume and flood duration of flooding nodes sensitivity of flooding nodes and maximum percentage of each type of green infrastructure gi in each sub catchment based on land use analysis as a preliminary step of the multi objective optimization process followed by decision making procedure the application results reveal that optimal designs of grey infrastructure are more cost effective and may have a significant influence on the reduction of flood damages and outlet peak flow compared to gi from their individual evaluations while gi improves uds functionality performance indicators e g resilience reliability and sustainability better than grey infrastructure however a combined implementation of both infrastructures boosts their advantages because of the synchronization effect compared to individual scenarios providing the most cost effective optimal uds designs moreover the cost effectiveness of coupled green grey infrastructures designs could be enhanced from lower to higher design storms because of higher rate of utilization of stormwater infiltration and storage capacities of both infrastructures the framework presented in this study can be conveniently generalized to other case studies for optimal implementation of green grey infrastructures as long as including their local economic parameters climatic patterns urban development plans and green grey infrastructures design guidelines keywords green grey infrastructures flood damage reduction resilience optimization decision making data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally urban flooding phenomena severely triggered by various uncertain threats including uncontrolled urbanization growth climate change impacts traditional design and aging infrastructure and continuous reduction in storage and conveyance capacities of grey infrastructures bakhshipour et al 2021 wang et al 2022b urbanization and climate change together substantially increase surface runoff during extreme rainfall events which severely exceeds uds s design capacity resulting in functional failure of some parts or entire drainage system e g manhole overflow surcharging and surface flooding mugume and butler 2016 mugume et al 2015 shafeeque et al 2022 moreover uds s performance is also severely affected by structural failure of some components or the whole drainage system e g pipe blockage and collapse sediment deposition pump failure etc and failure to deliver desired function of failed components produce malfunctioning of other parts of system investigation and quantification of functional failures of uds because of exceptional uncertain threats e g extreme rainfall have become crucial and need a comprehensive study to plan evaluate and optimize solutions for minimization of loss of system functionality e g pluvial flooding magnitude and duration resilience concept is formally defined and interpreted for engineering systems like uds as the degree to which the system minimizes level of service failure magnitude and duration over its design life when subject to exceptional conditions butler et al 2014 quantification of uds resilience tests the system s functional performance against different degrees of exceptional conditions and its potential to recover from failure states consideration of resilience for uds planning design and development at its early stages provides critical statics about its functional performance level and guides at what scale it needs to improve or maintain for acceptable functionality levels to avoid disastrous future flood damages awareness is needed about importance of resilience assessment for uds planning design and development for example the uk government has made it compulsory for local industries and water companies in england and wales to consider resilience quantification for planning and development of water supply and drainage developments projects baker et al 2018 defra 2016 gallego lopez and essex 2016 moreover existing uds resilience can be enhanced by retrofitting it with individual and combined implementation of green and grey infrastructures guptha et al 2022 islam et al 2022 xu et al 2021 however a comprehensive study is needed to quantify resilience improvement levels of uds against different retrofitting scales with exceptional conditions i e extreme rainfalls considering the cost effectiveness of different alternatives e g green and grey infrastructures here extreme rainfalls represent the rainfall of those return periods which are larger than the designed return period of the urban drainage system over the recent years performance evaluation of green infrastructures gis has proven its substantial benefits e g quantitative and qualitative chui et al 2016 duan et al 2016b fiori and volpi 2020 li et al 2019 li et al 2020 tansar et al 2022 xing et al 2021 yang et al 2021 however limited capability of gis to control surface runoff during extreme rainfalls proved gis alone is not reliable and sustainable solution for replacement of grey infrastructure and improvement of uds s resilience various previous research studies have confirmed coupled green grey infrastructure approach as the most promising alternative for enhancement of uds s resilience because together both alternatives combined multi functionality and decentralization distribution of gi and reliability and acceptability of grey infrastructure detention tank dt bakhshipour et al 2019 bakhshipour et al 2021 wang et al 2022b optimal planning and designing of green grey infrastructures for a larger catchment is a challenging task because multiple factors including type location and size of gis and positions and storage volume of grey infrastructures required optimum selection considering technical economic and hydraulic limitations eckart et al 2017 previous research studies employed a conventional scenario analysis method in which every single combination of gi practice was individually analyzed which is an inefficient approach when there are multiple types of gis and proposed locations dong et al 2020 simulation optimization is the most promising and widely employed approach to finding optimal solutions for gis and grey infrastructure because of their capability to handle highly non linear complex and discrete optimization problems oraei zare et al 2012 although multiple recent research studies have used a simulation optimization approach to obtain optimal solutions of either only gis or grey infrastructure or their combinations bao et al 2020 duan et al 2016a duarte lopes et al 2021 islam et al 2021 leng et al 2021 li et al 2015 ngamalieu nengoue et al 2019 she et al 2021 wang et al 2022a xu et al 2018b yazdi et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 however most of them lack in preliminary assessment for optimal locations of grey infrastructure considering flooding hotspots within a catchment and their degree of sensitivity based on nearby important places e g schools hospitals railway stations commercial and industrial areas etc consideration of preliminary assessment before simulation optimization actually becomes a two stage simulation optimization approach in which the first stage helps to prioritize flooding hotspots based on flooding situation e g flood volume and duration of nodes and sensitivity of nodes by using a multi criteria decision making mcdm method e g analytic hierarchy process ahp topsis etc vojtek et al 2021 and second stage finds optimal storage volume of optimal locations wang et al 2017 moreover a comprehensive land use preliminary analysis is necessary for the efficient designing of gis to determine impervious area at each sub catchment or parcel level for the determination of suitable gi candidates their combinations and required sizes and retrofitting criteria for improving the cost effectiveness of gi implementation and maximization of its target benefits limited research studies have included uds resilience as their objective function in optimization bakhshipour et al 2019 bakhshipour et al 2021 wang et al 2022b and to the best of our knowledge no study has optimized uds resilience enhancement and flood damage reductions against retrofitting cost of gis and grey infrastructure further simulation optimization process produces large numbers of pareto optimal solutions or near optimal solutions considering different hydraulic economic and technical constraints these optimal solutions increase benefit of one objective function by compromising another a coupled optimization and decision making framework is necessary for the selection of optimal designs considering different pareto optimal solutions system performance indicators and technical and practical constraints the above mentioned research gaps are filled with the following three main research objectives 1 to understand the significance of preliminary assessment of optimal positioning of gis and grey infrastructures before the optimization process 2 to optimize and compare gis and grey infrastructure in individual and combined settings for flood damage reduction and uds s performance indicators enhancement 3 to understand the impact of decision making on the selection of optimal solutions for better utilization of optimization outputs a multi objective optimization based decision making framework is developed to study and discuss the above mentioned three research objectives and the discussion is based on the following sections of the paper section 2 discusses a detailed methodological framework including model development optimization problem set up and decision making sections 3 5 explain results and analysis further discussion and implications and summary and conclusions respectively 2 methodology the multi objective optimization based decision making framework is

approximate elevation of 4 m above mean sea level frequent heavy rainfall in monsoon season rapid urbanization development and high urbanization rate made this region highly vulnerable to monsoon

extensively applied for the planning and designing of local uds tansar et al 2022 yang et al 2020 the step by step methodological framework based on three important parts is shown in fig 2 2 1 2 preliminary assessment of green grey infrastructures a green infrastructure green infrastructure was planned and designed based on comprehensive land use analysis of the study area and the impervious area of each sub catchment was estimated green infrastructure was designed only for retrofitting impervious areas considering local design guidelines sub catchment topographical characteristics and site suitability four types of green infrastructures including bioretention cell br green roof gr permeable pavement pp and rain garden rg were selected as appropriate for placement in the catchment and their designed parameters are mentioned in table s1 in the supplementary material different types of land uses were retrofitted with single or combined gis by following defined retrofitting rules based on local design guidelines as mentioned in table 2 b grey infrastructure a preliminary assessment for the placement of grey infrastructure was conducted for identification of reasonable locations within the catchment analytic hierarchy process ahp is applied for ranking and selection of flooding nodes based on defined indicators including flood volume flood duration and sensitivity of flooding nodes considering importance of their nearby classified land uses i e building types an expert scoring method is applied to assign different scores based on corresponding criteria of each evaluation indicator for each node more information and technical details about grey infrastructure selection method are mentioned in section 3 1 the detail retrofit life cycle costs of green and grey infrastructures were estimated and provided in section s1 and table s4 in the supplementary material green grey infrastructures are optimally designed for seven scenarios as represented in table 1 2 2

of 6 m and 5 m with respect to roads in accordance with design guidelines of mohurd 2014 detention volume of all grey infrastructures was used as decision variables and their maximum limit of detention volumes is decided based on percentage of system flooding volume 2 2 1 optimization algorithm nsga ii is one of the most widely used multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas for planning designing and optimization of green grey infrastructures because of its capability to deal with complex highly non linear and discrete optimization problems deb et al 2002 oraei zare et al 2012 the global optimization solutions are searched by following natural selection and survival of fittest rules the initial population of decision variables is iteratively improved by mutation and crossover to escape local optimum traps and preservation of diversity in the offspring population nsga ii speed up its performance and improved its solutions quality by utilizing a fast non dominated sorting and selection approach by calculation of elitist crowding distance nsga ii is integrated with pyswmm a python wrapper for stormwater management model in python environment mcdonnell et al 2020 nsga ii generates set of solutions of decision variables of green and grey infrastructures which is introduced to update respective decision variables in swmm input file swmm is executed based on updated decision variables and objective functions are calculated by following defined constraints this process is iteratively executed for optimum number of iterations to find non dominated pareto optimal solutions the following optimization algorithm parameters are used to converge the optimization problem population size 200 crossover probability 0 9 mutation probability 0 1 number of iterations 300 2 2 2 flood damage assessment and cost estimation flood damages are influenced by several factors including direct indirect tangible and intangible flood losses however potential flood damages are occurred because of direct tangible damages which can accurately be estimated based on inundation depth and depth damage curves in small urban catchments alves et al 2019 the 1d 2d or 2d hydrodynamic models are extensively used for simulation of inundation depth but they require higher computational resources and time to overcome computational cost problems during optimization process a simple surrogate model is developed to emulate the original 2d hydrodynamic process based on 1d model and volume depth look up curves of flooded nodes a 1d 2d hydrodynamic model of the study area is developed based on hexagonal mesh with a higher resolution of digital surface model dsm in pcswmm to develop volume depth look up curves the 1d 2d model was simulated for different design rainfall scenarios e g 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 years and the overflow volume of each flooded node and the corresponding average of maximum inundation depth of area around each node for each simulation scenario was calculated the volume depth look up curves were established at each flooded node based on overflow volume and average inundation depth of different scenarios once volume depth look up curves are established and assigned accordingly on each flooded node then these curves calculate inundation depth based on overflow volume that affects different types of buildings around each node as a result flood damages were estimated by combining volume depth look up curves depth damage functions and unit construction cost of each building category this method saved large computational costs required for the iterative simulation of 2d models to find optimal solutions during optimization process firstly the green grey infrastructures are iteratively placed within sub catchments and 1d model is executed and average of maximum depths around each flooded node is registered by utilizing previously developed volume depth look up curves secondly the flood damages occurred because each flooded node was calculated based on flood depth depth damage curves and unit construction cost of each building category lastly total flood damages were estimated by addition of damages recorded at all look up points the methodology of building damage cost estimation and depth damage curves and unit construction costs of different building categories are represented in fig 3 a and 3b and table s2 respectively 2 2 3 system performance indicators the following system performance indicators were employed for the evaluation of the system s functionality limited number of objectives functions i e 1 lcc of green grey infrastructures 2 flood damage cost 3 uds resilience are evaluated during optimization process and the remaining three performance indicators i e reliability sustainability and outlet peak flow were calculated based on optimal designs because the computational power required for optimization exponentially increases with the increase of the number of objective functions especially for larger uds with a higher number of decision variables larger than 1000 1 urban drainage system resilience uds resilience is determined by a performance based resilience index developed by mugume et al 2015 and calculated based on the concept of severity severity is a function of the maximum magnitude degree of functional failure and its duration for a uds under exceptional conditions extreme rainfall event is the main stressor for urban drainage system performance and uds resilience is calculated by estimating the magnitude of loss in system functionality and failure duration mean nodal flood duration the resilience index resilience f can be estimated as follows 12 resilience f 1 s e v i 1 v tf v ti t f t n where resilience f functional resilience of uds is determined by measuring system residual functionality which is computed by one minus volumetric severity v tf v ti v tf is total flooding volume from all flooded nodes v ti is total inflow volume t f is average flooding durations of all flooded nodes t n is total elapsed simulation time the value of resilience f is ranges from 0 to 1 and shows different states of uds resilience between extreme values with 0 being the lowest level the highest flood volume and 1 being the highest level no flood volume more technical details about the resilience index and severity concept can be found in previous studies mugume and butler 2016 mugume et al 2015 2 reliability reliability is defined as the degree to which the system minimises level of service failure frequency over its design life when subject to standard loading butler et al 2014 butler et al 2017 uds of shanghai is designed for 1 year design rainfall and system is not expected to be flooded for the selected design storm the reliability of the uds is estimated by the following relationship 13 reliability 0 i f hpi 1 1 hpi t i f hpi 1 1 14 hpi t 1 v tf v ti where hpi t is the hydraulic performance index of a selected design storm for evaluation the reliability of uds is considered zero for the designed storm i e 1 year design rainfall with no flooding in the system the reliability of uds higher than its designed storms is calculated under different green grey infrastructures optimal solutions against retrofit costs 3 sustainability sustainability is defined as the degree to which the system maintains levels of service in the long term whilst maximising social economic and environmental goals butler et al 2014 butler et al 2017 life cycle costs of green and grey infrastructures are employed as economic sustainability indicator which is calculated considering capital construction costs and operation and maintenance costs of both infrastructures over their typical service periods as shown in section s1 and table s4 in the supplementary material environmental sustainability is calculated with a simple relationship as the ratio of total infiltration and storage volume to total precipitation volume under design storm as defined by bakhshipour et al 2019 and bakhshipour et al 2021 as follows 15 sustainability infiltration volume f i n a l s t o r a g e total precipitation 4 outlet peak flow the control of peak stormwater at the outlets becomes critical especially when there are wastewater treatment plants or receiving water bodies existing at outlets of the urban catchment with the limited capacity of intakes the outlet peak flow of both outlets is calculated for optimal designs to understand the degree of reduction with the application of different optimal designs of green grey infrastructures 2 3 decision making method 2 3 1 topsis method the simulation optimization step generates multiple optimal solutions based on defined objectives functions constraints and decision variables the comprehensive evaluation of optimal solutions is necessary based on different indicators in addition to optimization as a post optimization process which makes decision process more easier for stakeholders for better selection and utilization of optimal sizes and locations of green and grey infrastructures in retrofitting stages topsis is one of the most widely used multi criteria decision making analysis mcda tools used for the decision making process which ranks multiple solutions under defined indicators based on euclidean distance from the best and worst solutions the main steps of topsis are represented in fig 2 decision making and governed by the following eqs 13 16 as follows 13 r ij x ij i 1 m x ij 2 14 s i j 1 n r ij r ij w j 2 15 s i j 1 n r ij r ij w j 2 16 c i s i s i s i where x ij is the original evaluation matrix containing ith solution jth criteria r ij is the normalized evaluation matrix r ij and r ij are the best and worst solutions for ith solution and jth criteria s i and s i are the euclidean distances from the ideal and negative ideal solutions w j is the weight of criteria ci is the ranking of ith solution 2 3 2 entropy weight method the calculation and allocation of weights to different criteria is a key step that significantly affects the selections and rankings of solutions based on defined criteria the entropy method which is based on the principle of information theory is selected because of its characteristics of minimization of subjectivity e g personal experience and preferences during the weights calculation process the higher the differences between each criterion the more information is covered the more important criteria are and the higher their weights should be the following equations are used to calculate weights 17 w j 1 e j j 1 n 1 e j 18 e j 1 ln m i 1 m p ij ln p ij 19 p ij r ij i 1 r r ij where e j is the entropy of weight and p ij is the standardized value of ith solution jth criteria 3 results and analysis 3 1 preliminary assessment of green grey infrastructures decentralized based grey infrastructure network temporarily stores stormwater within urban catchments during peak rainfall periods and returns to the drainage system during the recession period the ahp method is applied for the preliminary selection of optimal locations of grey infrastructure considering three important indicators including flood volume and flood duration of nodes and ranking of sensitive nodes based on nearby important locations e g building types the main objective of the preliminary assessment of grey infrastructure locations is to give higher priorities to the most important places within cities e g schools hospitals railway stations commercial and industrial areas etc which are highly vulnerable by flood hotspots in order to reduce potential flood damages on priority basis however the optimization algorithms alone can only search optimal locations of grey infrastructures based on defined hydraulic constraints e g flood volume and flood duration of nodes without considering the significance of nearby areas considering this limitation a preliminary selection process is adopted for finding optimum grey infrastructure locations considering flood hotspots and prioritization of nearby land uses a 100 year design rainfall of 2 h duration is selected and simulated for estimation of flood volume and duration at nodes in search of optimal locations the 100 year storm is selected because the chinese government is planning to upgrade existing urban drainage systems up to 50 year or 100 year design return period in the coming decades xu et al 2018a the land use is classified and ranked into five categories total ranges of three evaluation indicators are equally divided into five levels i e maximum minimum 5 and assigned correspondingly to each level score considering five land use classes as represented in table 3 the corresponding evaluation indicator score of each flooding node is recorded the scores of defined evaluation indicators of each flooding node are calculated based on table 3 as shown in table s3 in the supplementary material the top ten flooded nodes with the highest total scores of three evaluation indicators are selected for placement of grey infrastructure as shown in table 4 locating grey infrastructure at flood hotspots or nearby maximizes its benefits by reducing probability of urban flooding to a higher extent compared to its location at a place with lower risk of urban flooding location and maximum proportion of each type of gi i e bioretention cell green roof permeable pavement and rain garden in every sub catchment are planned and designed according to the detailed land use analysis by considering site suitability for green infrastructure installation local gis design and development guidelines and cost information 3 2 optimization of green grey infrastructures optimization of green grey infrastructures is conducted for seven scenarios under different extreme rainfall events e g 5 10 20 and 100 years scenario based optimization approach provides better decision making circumstances for stakeholders especially when there is limited availability of required resources e g green grey infrastructure development areas limited budgets multi stage land use development plans stakeholder preferences and risk attitudes etc for placement of either of green and grey infrastructures or both also when stakeholders need comprehensive information about the trade off of retrofit costs and benefits at different retrofit scales decisions can easily be made based on a scenario based optimization approach when stakeholders need a comprehensive and comparative analysis between one time retrofitting at a larger scale and multi stage retrofitting at a smaller scale the approximate pareto optimal designs of seven scenarios s1 s7 under different system performance indicators are represented correspondingly in fig 4 a c for a 100 year design rainfall event each vertical axis demonstrates the system performance objective and all horizontal lines represent non dominated approximate pareto optimal solutions in total of 200 the complete spectrum of colour represents different retrofit costs calculated based on different retrofit scales with blue being the lowest and red being the highest generally with an increase in retrofit costs in all scenarios the damage costs and outlet peak flows decrease and uds resilience reliability and sustainability increase take s1 as an example where only green infrastructure was considered for replacement of impervious area optimized with a range of retrofit cost of 154 8 185 3 million usd reducing total damage cost of 2473 9 2710 1 million usd and outlet peak flow of 152 9 154 5 m3 s and enhancing system resilience reliability and sustainability of 0 89 0 90 0 49 0 51 37 6 40 6 respectively as shown in fig 4a in comparison to s1 s2 where only grey infrastructure optimized with a range of retrofit cost of 2 2 9 6 million usd far less than compared to s1 produces relatively similar benefits in terms of damage cost reduction of 2414 3 2877 2 million usd however other system performance indicators were comparatively poorer including drainage system resilience reliability and sustainability of 0 85 0 87 0 45 0 52 and 22 0 29 8 respectively as shown in fig 4b however outlet peak flow was significantly reduced with grey infrastructure s2 implementation compared to green infrastructure s1 and has a range of 137 3 152 6 m3 s the comparative assessment of s1 and s2 represents that both scenarios have similar potential for flood damage reduction however s2 is highly cost effective and has a larger influence on control of outlet peak flow compared to s1 while s1 ensures comparatively better improvement in system functionality and reliability considering the benefits of s1 and s2 these scenarios were combined into s3 s3 significantly reduced damage cost with a range of 1547 4 2032 0 million usd by investing a range of relatively lesser amount of 156 6 199 4 million usd fig 4c compared to combined damage costs and investments of s1 and s2 moreover other system performance indicators resilience reliability and sustainability also showed relative improvements while a significant improvement in the reduction of outlet peak flow is observed 137 5 147 9 m3 s the subsequent scenarios s4 s7 represent a comparison of benefits in terms of damage cost and outlet peak flow reduction system functionality improvement with different levels of investments by retrofitting different scales of green and grey infrastructures fig 5 a d for example comparison of s4 fig 5a and s5 fig 5b represents that s5 is more cost effective than s4 by comparing their costs and benefits it may be because of higher percentage of grey infrastructure in s5 produces higher ratio of benefits over cost in comparison to s4 furthermore s6 and s7 provides further explanation of comparative analysis of optimization scenarios with different levels of configurations for better understanding of benefits against retrofitting costs as shown in fig 5c and 5d it is also important to note that combined optimization scenarios i e s4 s7 with their higher retrofitting scales fig 5 produces far larger benefits compared to individual and combined optimization scenarios i e s1 s3 with lower retrofitting scales fig 4 multiple optimal designs of green grey infrastructures with various retrofitting scales improve the understanding of decision makers and stakeholders of their combined benefits under different configurations and they can prioritize and select any of the most appropriate optimal designs for implementation considering various factors including budget availability space availability for green grey infrastructures development local stakeholders preferences and their attitudes towards urban flood risk reduction urban planning design and development stages and significance of outlet peak flow control apart from these factors other influencing factors can also be included or varied depending upon the nature of the case study for example extreme climatic patterns local green grey infrastructures design guidelines and rules etc 3 3 decision making for selection of optimal designs topsis is a decision making tool used for the selection of one optimal design among all in each scenario s1 s7 considering the significance of each performance indicator the significance of each performance indicator is calculated by estimating their entropy weights for all scenarios in order to avoid subjectivity in the decision making process table 5 represents values of performance indicators of selected optimal designs of different scenarios with their topsis scores and rankings the decision making procedure considers all performance indicators during selection process and its results reveal that s2 ranked at first place followed by s5 s4 and the remaining four scenarios ranked as s1 s6 s7 and s3 respectively with comparison of selected optimal designs between s1 and s2 it is important to mention that a larger reduction in damage cost 23 6 and outlet peak flow 10 4 estimated for s2 compared to s1 having damage cost 21 2 and outlet peak flow 0 1 which is calculated with reference to base case scenario as shown in fig 6 moreover s1 and s2 optimal designs need retrofit costs of 184 8 million usd and 9 6 million usd which indicates s2 is highly cost effective than s1 as represented in table 5 in contrast s2 optimal design showed poorer performance for resilience and sustainability improvement compared to s1 these results indicate that selected optimal designs may have different potentials towards different system performance indicators however it is now the decision maker s responsibility to examine and select optimal design prioritizing target system performance indicators and available retrofit cost by comparison of s1 and s2 with s3 s3 produces higher benefits in terms of reduction in damage cost 39 4 and outlet peak flow 4 2 and enhancement in system resilience 5 1 reliability 24 1 and sustainability 2 5 respectively by investing retrofit cost of 176 1 million usd which is less than the combined retrofit cost of s1 and s2 or even less than s1 individual retrofit cost it is inferred from these results that green and grey infrastructures advantages increase during their combined implementation considering construction costs and target design benefits with comparison of s4 with s3 double s4 s retrofit costs lead to a significant increase in s4 s advantages but relatively less than double s3 s advantages moreover comparing s5 with s4 no significant improvements in benefits of s5 compared to s4 are noted with additional expansion of its storage volume it is reasonable to explain that additional storage volume in s5 could not further increase benefits because required detention volume for storage of overflow flood volume at target flood hotspots has already been fully exploited in s4 and additional storage volume in s5 may not significantly be contributed at grey infrastructure locations the comparison of s6 and s7 represents trade off between retrofit costs and target design benefits where the higher proportion of gi in s7 produces significantly larger benefits in terms of damage cost reduction and system functionality enhancements compared to s6 with larger investments in s7 compared to s6 3 4 system performance evaluation of selected optimal designs at different return periods the selected optimal designs of different scenarios are evaluated under different design rainfall conditions to understand how retrofit costs and other system performance indicators vary with respect to variations in storm magnitude as shown in fig 7 results reveal that selected optimal designs of s1 and s2 represent minor differences between their investments of different return periods i e individual implementation of green grey infrastructures lower retrofit scale fig 7a and interestingly a significant variation in damage costs of corresponding return periods is observed fig 7b however while in case of s4 s7 i e combined implementation of green grey infrastructures higher retrofit scale an opposite trend of retrofit costs for lower to higher return periods are noted and corresponding damage costs showed comparatively less variation with respect to s1 and s2 these results highlight three important aspects 1 lower scale retrofitting designs of green and grey infrastructures with their individual implementations configurations have limited capability to reduce damages of higher design rainfall return periods as they exceed its target design goals 2 higher scale retrofitting designs of combined green grey infrastructures are more effective for lower and higher design rainfall return periods as these designs have larger potential for infiltration and storage of stormwater which can be utilized at its maximum potential for higher storms 3 cost effectiveness of green grey infrastructures is increased for lower to higher return periods because green grey infrastructures utilized its higher infiltration and storage capacities in return of benefits at higher return periods compared to lower comparative assessment of lower and higher retrofit scale designs under different configurations and design rainfall return periods explain that designing and implementation of green grey infrastructures is more cost effective for higher storms compared to lower considering trade off between investments and benefits moreover other system performance indicators including uds resilience reliability and sustainability consistently reduced from lower to higher rainfall return periods in all scenarios while outlet peak flow increased 4 further discussion and implications optimal designing and implementation of green grey infrastructures for stormwater management is a complex and challenging process because of multiple influencing factors including historical and future climatic conditions urban land use development rate population growth aging infrastructure locally available resources and economic budget stakeholders preferences urban flood risk history etc ferrans et al 2022 islam et al 2021 ruangpan et al 2020 shishegar et al 2018 webber and samaras 2022 zhang and chui 2018 considering the above mentioned factors it certainly becomes hard for an alone optimization method to answer the following questions which type of gi and how much of its proportion should be retrofitted in each sub catchment based on available land uses and future urban land development plans what would be optimal positions and volume of grey infrastructures for reduction of specific full urban flood damages how single and combined green and grey infrastructure configurations with different retrofit scales perform for urban flood damage reduction and system functionality improvement cristiano et al 2021 eckart et al 2017 gimenez maranges et al 2020 a combined optimization and decision making framework is developed in this study which precisely selects optimal positions of detention tanks and maximum retrofit scale of each gi type in each sub catchment based on comprehensive land use analysis as a preliminary step before optimization following by decision making is performed for the selection of optimal designs based on defined system performance indicators comparative optimization results of individual green and grey infrastructures provide evidence that grey infrastructure is more cost effective than green infrastructure has larger control on outlet peak flow and has significant potential for flood damage reduction however green infrastructure is relatively better for improvement in system s functional operational performance considering optimization objective functions of this study i e minimizing life cycle cost minimizing flood damage cost maximizing system resilience both infrastructures have proved their pros and cons with respect to defined objectives a comprehensive evaluation and optimization of coupled green grey infrastructures under various design configurations are performed to evaluate trade off between benefits and costs results pertinently explain that collective implementation of both infrastructures synchronizes their advantages by providing higher benefits against lower costs in comparison to their individual implementations these results are supported by previous research studies alves et al 2019 alves et al 2020 leng et al 2021 martínez et al 2021 xu et al 2019 yao et al 2022 where both green and grey infrastructure represent alternative benefits however their coupled application proved as the best adaptation strategy in terms of benefits improvement i e flood damage reduction system functionality and water quality improvement and retrofit costs reduction decision making process ranks and selects the best optimal designs based on defined system performance indicators and number of available optimal solutions raei et al 2019 results provide evidence that individual grey infrastructure optimal design is more cost effective than green infrastructure and both have limited capacities for flood damage reduction and system functionality improvement however combined implementation of green grey infrastructures is more cost effective than their individual applications and this strategy enhances their benefits compared to individuals through decentralized based stormwater infiltration i e on site stormwater management in each sub catchment followed by storage at nearby located grey infrastructure this approach helps to reduce the probability of urban flood risk by minimizing chances of synchronization of peak flow and exceedance of stormwater to uds capacity in addition evaluation of green grey infrastructures with various configurations retrofit scales under different rainstorm scenarios proved a higher benefit over cost ratio for higher design storms compared to lower because of the higher rate of infiltration and storage volumes in higher storms compared to lower resultantly green grey infrastructure s retrofit scale should be carefully designed considering target design benefits availability of budget and space and urban development plan e g development stages in order to avoid consequences of over design i e costly or under design i e flood problems comparative results of green and grey infrastructures presented in this research may be different from other studies because of differences in economic parameters of retrofit costs and flood damage costs however the framework established in this study can be generalized and applied for optimization and decision making of green grey infrastructures the multi objective optimization based decision making framework presented in this study can be extended in future research studies by including stakeholders involvement to incorporate their perceptions opinions for urban flood risk reduction and green grey infrastructures implementation for consideration and evaluation of the impact of subjectivity in the decisions on planning design and development of green grey infrastructures 5 summary and conclusions this study established a multi objective decision making based framework for planning and implementing green grey infrastructures to reduce flood damages and improve uds resilience in this developed framework the green grey infrastructures is designed in three stages including 1 a preliminary assessment of both types of infrastructures 2 optimization of locations and sizes volumes of both infrastructures and 3 selection of optimal designs based on system performance indicators by using a decision making method comparative evaluation of the optimal design results of green and grey infrastructures concludes that grey infrastructure is more cost effective and has relatively better potential for reduction in flood damages and outlet peak flow compared to green infrastructure however green infrastructure significantly performs better than grey infrastructure in the enhancement of system performance indicators i e uds resilience reliability and sustainability furthermore comparison of the combined green grey infrastructures implementation with individual application scenarios demonstrates significant improvement in their benefits in coupled approach compared to their individual scenarios in this regard the combined implementation strategy has been proved to be the most cost effective compared to their individual implementations with various design configurations retrofit scales meanwhile the cost effectiveness of coupled green grey infrastructures can be enhanced from low to high intensity storms because of the higher rate of utilization of stormwater infiltration and storage capacities of both infrastructures from this point of view the combined implementation of both green and grey infrastructure is recommended for future urban land use development plans to control stormwater in the studied uds however it is also noted that their retrofit scales should be carefully decided considering the availability of resources including economic budget and required space urban development and climatic projections population growth and target design goals based on the findings of this study future research direction is recommended to include the quantification of stakeholders preferences and attitudes towards green grey infrastructures development and urban flood risk reduction for a more realistic assessment for practical implementations

grey infrastructures implementation for addressing urban flood damages and urban drainage system uds resilience respectively needs comprehensive evaluation under various planning and design influencing factors in this paper a multi objective decision making framework is developed for the optimization of green grey infrastructures to understand the trade off between benefits and retrofit costs under various design configurations rainfall intensities and system performance indicators in the developed framework the grey infrastructure locations are optimally determined by using analytic hierarchy process ahp method with three defined indicators e g flood volume and flood duration of flooding nodes sensitivity of flooding nodes and maximum percentage of each type of green infrastructure gi in each sub catchment based on land use analysis as a preliminary step of the multi objective optimization process followed by decision making procedure the application results reveal that optimal designs of grey infrastructure are more cost effective and may have a significant influence on the reduction of flood damages and outlet peak flow compared to gi from their individual evaluations while gi improves uds functionality performance indicators e g resilience reliability and sustainability better than grey infrastructure however a combined implementation of both infrastructures boosts their advantages because of the synchronization effect compared to individual scenarios providing the most cost effective optimal uds designs moreover the cost effectiveness of coupled green grey infrastructures designs could be enhanced from lower to higher design storms because of higher rate of utilization of stormwater infiltration and storage capacities of both infrastructures the framework presented in this study can be conveniently generalized to other case studies for optimal implementation of green grey infrastructures as long as including their local economic parameters climatic patterns urban development plans and green grey infrastructures design guidelines keywords green grey infrastructures flood damage reduction resilience optimization decision making data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally urban flooding phenomena severely triggered by various uncertain threats including uncontrolled urbanization growth climate change impacts traditional design and aging infrastructure and continuous reduction in storage and conveyance capacities of grey infrastructures bakhshipour et al 2021 wang et al 2022b urbanization and climate change together substantially increase surface runoff during extreme rainfall events which severely exceeds uds s design capacity resulting in functional failure of some parts or entire drainage system e g manhole overflow surcharging and surface flooding mugume and butler 2016 mugume et al 2015 shafeeque et al 2022 moreover uds s performance is also severely affected by structural failure of some components or the whole drainage system e g pipe blockage and collapse sediment deposition pump failure etc and failure to deliver desired function of failed components produce malfunctioning of other parts of system investigation and quantification of functional failures of uds because of exceptional uncertain threats e g extreme rainfall have become crucial and need a comprehensive study to plan evaluate and optimize solutions for minimization of loss of system functionality e g pluvial flooding magnitude and duration resilience concept is formally defined and interpreted for engineering systems like uds as the degree to which the system minimizes level of service failure magnitude and duration over its design life when subject to exceptional conditions butler et al 2014 quantification of uds resilience tests the system s functional performance against different degrees of exceptional conditions and its potential to recover from failure states consideration of resilience for uds planning design and development at its early stages provides critical statics about its functional performance level and guides at what scale it needs to improve or maintain for acceptable functionality levels to avoid disastrous future flood damages awareness is needed about importance of resilience assessment for uds planning design and development for example the uk government has made it compulsory for local industries and water companies in england and wales to consider resilience quantification for planning and development of water supply and drainage developments projects baker et al 2018 defra 2016 gallego lopez and essex 2016 moreover existing uds resilience can be enhanced by retrofitting it with individual and combined implementation of green and grey infrastructures guptha et al 2022 islam et al 2022 xu et al 2021 however a comprehensive study is needed to quantify resilience improvement levels of uds against different retrofitting scales with exceptional conditions i e extreme rainfalls considering the cost effectiveness of different alternatives e g green and grey infrastructures here extreme rainfalls represent the rainfall of those return periods which are larger than the designed return period of the urban drainage system over the recent years performance evaluation of green infrastructures gis has proven its substantial benefits e g quantitative and qualitative chui et al 2016 duan et al 2016b fiori and volpi 2020 li et al 2019 li et al 2020 tansar et al 2022 xing et al 2021 yang et al 2021 however limited capability of gis to control surface runoff during extreme rainfalls proved gis alone is not reliable and sustainable solution for replacement of grey infrastructure and improvement of uds s resilience various previous research studies have confirmed coupled green grey infrastructure approach as the most promising alternative for enhancement of uds s resilience because together both alternatives combined multi functionality and decentralization distribution of gi and reliability and acceptability of grey infrastructure detention tank dt bakhshipour et al 2019 bakhshipour et al 2021 wang et al 2022b optimal planning and designing of green grey infrastructures for a larger catchment is a challenging task because multiple factors including type location and size of gis and positions and storage volume of grey infrastructures required optimum selection considering technical economic and hydraulic limitations eckart et al 2017 previous research studies employed a conventional scenario analysis method in which every single combination of gi practice was individually analyzed which is an inefficient approach when there are multiple types of gis and proposed locations dong et al 2020 simulation optimization is the most promising and widely employed approach to finding optimal solutions for gis and grey infrastructure because of their capability to handle highly non linear complex and discrete optimization problems oraei zare et al 2012 although multiple recent research studies have used a simulation optimization approach to obtain optimal solutions of either only gis or grey infrastructure or their combinations bao et al 2020 duan et al 2016a duarte lopes et al 2021 islam et al 2021 leng et al 2021 li et al 2015 ngamalieu nengoue et al 2019 she et al 2021 wang et al 2022a xu et al 2018b yazdi et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 however most of them lack in preliminary assessment for optimal locations of grey infrastructure considering flooding hotspots within a catchment and their degree of sensitivity based on nearby important places e g schools hospitals railway stations commercial and industrial areas etc consideration of preliminary assessment before simulation optimization actually becomes a two stage simulation optimization approach in which the first stage helps to prioritize flooding hotspots based on flooding situation e g flood volume and duration of nodes and sensitivity of nodes by using a multi criteria decision making mcdm method e g analytic hierarchy process ahp topsis etc vojtek et al 2021 and second stage finds optimal storage volume of optimal locations wang et al 2017 moreover a comprehensive land use preliminary analysis is necessary for the efficient designing of gis to determine impervious area at each sub catchment or parcel level for the determination of suitable gi candidates their combinations and required sizes and retrofitting criteria for improving the cost effectiveness of gi implementation and maximization of its target benefits limited research studies have included uds resilience as their objective function in optimization bakhshipour et al 2019 bakhshipour et al 2021 wang et al 2022b and to the best of our knowledge no study has optimized uds resilience enhancement and flood damage reductions against retrofitting cost of gis and grey infrastructure further simulation optimization process produces large numbers of pareto optimal solutions or near optimal solutions considering different hydraulic economic and technical constraints these optimal solutions increase benefit of one objective function by compromising another a coupled optimization and decision making framework is necessary for the selection of optimal designs considering different pareto optimal solutions system performance indicators and technical and practical constraints the above mentioned research gaps are filled with the following three main research objectives 1 to understand the significance of preliminary assessment of optimal positioning of gis and grey infrastructures before the optimization process 2 to optimize and compare gis and grey infrastructure in individual and combined settings for flood damage reduction and uds s performance indicators enhancement 3 to understand the impact of decision making on the selection of optimal solutions for better utilization of optimization outputs a multi objective optimization based decision making framework is developed to study and discuss the above mentioned three research objectives and the discussion is based on the following sections of the paper section 2 discusses a detailed methodological framework including model development optimization problem set up and decision making sections 3 5 explain results and analysis further discussion and implications and summary and conclusions respectively 2 methodology the multi objective optimization based decision making framework is

climate with annual precipitation of 1 170 mm and 69 of the annual rainfall occurring in the monsoon season i e april to september multiple factors including its low lying topography with an approximate elevation of 4 m above mean sea level frequent heavy rainfall in monsoon season rapid urbanization development and high urbanization rate made this region highly vulnerable to monsoon

extensively applied for the planning and designing of local uds tansar et al 2022 yang et al 2020 the step by step methodological framework based on three important parts is shown in fig 2 2 1 2 preliminary assessment of green grey infrastructures a green infrastructure green infrastructure was planned and designed based on comprehensive land use analysis of the study area and the impervious area of each sub catchment was estimated green infrastructure was designed only for retrofitting impervious areas considering local design guidelines sub catchment topographical characteristics and site suitability four types of green infrastructures including bioretention cell br green roof gr permeable pavement pp and rain garden rg were selected as appropriate for placement in the catchment and their designed parameters are mentioned in table s1 in the supplementary material different types of land uses were retrofitted with single or combined gis by following defined retrofitting rules based on local design guidelines as mentioned in table 2 b grey infrastructure a preliminary assessment for the placement of grey infrastructure was conducted for identification of reasonable locations within the catchment analytic hierarchy process ahp is applied for ranking and selection of flooding nodes based on defined indicators including flood volume flood duration and sensitivity of flooding nodes considering importance of their nearby classified land uses i e building types an expert scoring method is applied to assign different scores based on corresponding criteria of each evaluation indicator for each node more information and technical details about grey infrastructure selection method are mentioned in section 3 1 the detail retrofit life cycle costs of green and grey infrastructures were estimated and provided in section s1 and table s4 in the supplementary material green grey infrastructures are optimally designed for seven scenarios as represented in table 1 2 2

of 6 m and 5 m with respect to roads in accordance with design guidelines of mohurd 2014 detention volume of all grey infrastructures was used as decision variables and their maximum limit of detention volumes is decided based on percentage of system flooding volume 2 2 1 optimization algorithm nsga ii is one of the most widely used multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas for planning designing and optimization of green grey infrastructures because of its capability to deal with complex highly non linear and discrete optimization problems deb et al 2002 oraei zare et al 2012 the global optimization solutions are searched by following natural selection and survival of fittest rules the initial population of decision variables is iteratively improved by mutation and crossover to escape local optimum traps and preservation of diversity in the offspring population nsga ii speed up its performance and improved its solutions quality by utilizing a fast non dominated sorting and selection approach by calculation of elitist crowding distance nsga ii is integrated with pyswmm a python wrapper for stormwater management model in python environment mcdonnell et al 2020 nsga ii generates set of solutions of decision variables of green and grey infrastructures which is introduced to update respective decision variables in swmm input file swmm is executed based on updated decision variables and objective functions are calculated by following defined constraints this process is iteratively executed for optimum number of iterations to find non dominated pareto optimal solutions the following optimization algorithm parameters are used to converge the optimization problem population size 200 crossover probability 0 9 mutation probability 0 1 number of iterations 300 2 2 2 flood damage assessment and cost estimation flood damages are influenced by several factors including direct indirect tangible and intangible flood losses however potential flood damages are occurred because of direct tangible damages which can accurately be estimated based on inundation depth and depth damage curves in small urban catchments alves et al 2019 the 1d 2d or 2d hydrodynamic models are extensively used for simulation of inundation depth but they require higher computational resources and time to overcome computational cost problems during optimization process a simple surrogate model is developed to emulate the original 2d hydrodynamic process based on 1d model and volume depth look up curves of flooded nodes a 1d 2d hydrodynamic model of the study area is developed based on hexagonal mesh with a higher resolution of digital surface model dsm in pcswmm to develop volume depth look up curves the 1d 2d model was simulated for different design rainfall scenarios e g 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 years and the overflow volume of each flooded node and the corresponding average of maximum inundation depth of area around each node for each simulation scenario was calculated the volume depth look up curves were established at each flooded node based on overflow volume and average inundation depth of different scenarios once volume depth look up curves are established and assigned accordingly on each flooded node then these curves calculate inundation depth based on overflow volume that affects different types of buildings around each node as a result flood damages were estimated by combining volume depth look up curves depth damage functions and unit construction cost of each building category this method saved large computational costs required for the iterative simulation of 2d models to find optimal solutions during optimization process firstly the green grey infrastructures are iteratively placed within sub catchments and 1d model is executed and average of maximum depths around each flooded node is registered by utilizing previously developed volume depth look up curves secondly the flood damages occurred because each flooded node was calculated based on flood depth depth damage curves and unit construction cost of each building category lastly total flood damages were estimated by addition of damages recorded at all look up points the methodology of building damage cost estimation and depth damage curves and unit construction costs of different building categories are represented in fig 3 a and 3b and table s2 respectively 2 2 3 system performance indicators the following system performance indicators were employed for the evaluation of the system s functionality limited number of objectives functions i e 1 lcc of green grey infrastructures 2 flood damage cost 3 uds resilience are evaluated during optimization process and the remaining three performance indicators i e reliability sustainability and outlet peak flow were calculated based on optimal designs because the computational power required for optimization exponentially increases with the increase of the number of objective functions especially for larger uds with a higher number of decision variables larger than 1000 1 urban drainage system resilience uds resilience is determined by a performance based resilience index developed by mugume et al 2015 and calculated based on the concept of severity severity is a function of the maximum magnitude degree of functional failure and its duration for a uds under exceptional conditions extreme rainfall event is the main stressor for urban drainage system performance and uds resilience is calculated by estimating the magnitude of loss in system functionality and failure duration mean nodal flood duration the resilience index resilience f can be estimated as follows 12 resilience f 1 s e v i 1 v tf v ti t f t n where resilience f functional resilience of uds is determined by measuring system residual functionality which is computed by one minus volumetric severity v tf v ti v tf is total flooding volume from all flooded nodes v ti is total inflow volume t f is average flooding durations of all flooded nodes t n is total elapsed simulation time the value of resilience f is ranges from 0 to 1 and shows different states of uds resilience between extreme values with 0 being the lowest level the highest flood volume and 1 being the highest level no flood volume more technical details about the resilience index and severity concept can be found in previous studies mugume and butler 2016 mugume et al 2015 2 reliability reliability is defined as the degree to which the system minimises level of service failure frequency over its design life when subject to standard loading butler et al 2014 butler et al 2017 uds of shanghai is designed for 1 year design rainfall and system is not expected to be flooded for the selected design storm the reliability of the uds is estimated by the following relationship 13 reliability 0 i f hpi 1 1 hpi t i f hpi 1 1 14 hpi t 1 v tf v ti where hpi t is the hydraulic performance index of a selected design storm for evaluation the reliability of uds is considered zero for the designed storm i e 1 year design rainfall with no flooding in the system the reliability of uds higher than its designed storms is calculated under different green grey infrastructures optimal solutions against retrofit costs 3 sustainability sustainability is defined as the degree to which the system maintains levels of service in the long term whilst maximising social economic and environmental goals butler et al 2014 butler et al 2017 life cycle costs of green and grey infrastructures are employed as economic sustainability indicator which is calculated considering capital construction costs and operation and maintenance costs of both infrastructures over their typical service periods as shown in section s1 and table s4 in the supplementary material environmental sustainability is calculated with a simple relationship as the ratio of total infiltration and storage volume to total precipitation volume under design storm as defined by bakhshipour et al 2019 and bakhshipour et al 2021 as follows 15 sustainability infiltration volume f i n a l s t o r a g e total precipitation 4 outlet peak flow the control of peak stormwater at the outlets becomes critical especially when there are wastewater treatment plants or receiving water bodies existing at outlets of the urban catchment with the limited capacity of intakes the outlet peak flow of both outlets is calculated for optimal designs to understand the degree of reduction with the application of different optimal designs of green grey infrastructures 2 3 decision making method 2 3 1 topsis method the simulation optimization step generates multiple optimal solutions based on defined objectives functions constraints and decision variables the comprehensive evaluation of optimal solutions is necessary based on different indicators in addition to optimization as a post optimization process which makes decision process more easier for stakeholders for better selection and utilization of optimal sizes and locations of green and grey infrastructures in retrofitting stages topsis is one of the most widely used multi criteria decision making analysis mcda tools used for the decision making process which ranks multiple solutions under defined indicators based on euclidean distance from the best and worst solutions the main steps of topsis are represented in fig 2 decision making and governed by the following eqs 13 16 as follows 13 r ij x ij i 1 m x ij 2 14 s i j 1 n r ij r ij w j 2 15 s i j 1 n r ij r ij w j 2 16 c i s i s i s i where x ij is the original evaluation matrix containing ith solution jth criteria r ij is the normalized evaluation matrix r ij and r ij are the best and worst solutions for ith solution and jth criteria s i and s i are the euclidean distances from the ideal and negative ideal solutions w j is the weight of criteria ci is the ranking of ith solution 2 3 2 entropy weight method the calculation and allocation of weights to different criteria is a key step that significantly affects the selections and rankings of solutions based on defined criteria the entropy method which is based on the principle of information theory is selected because of its characteristics of minimization of subjectivity e g personal experience and preferences during the weights calculation process the higher the differences between each criterion the more information is covered the more important criteria are and the higher their weights should be the following equations are used to calculate weights 17 w j 1 e j j 1 n 1 e j 18 e j 1 ln m i 1 m p ij ln p ij 19 p ij r ij i 1 r r ij where e j is the entropy of weight and p ij is the standardized value of ith solution jth criteria 3 results and analysis 3 1 preliminary assessment of green grey infrastructures decentralized based grey infrastructure network temporarily stores stormwater within urban catchments during peak rainfall periods and returns to the drainage system during the recession period the ahp method is applied for the preliminary selection of optimal locations of grey infrastructure considering three important indicators including flood volume and flood duration of nodes and ranking of sensitive nodes based on nearby important locations e g building types the main objective of the preliminary assessment of grey infrastructure locations is to give higher priorities to the most important places within cities e g schools hospitals railway stations commercial and industrial areas etc which are highly vulnerable by flood hotspots in order to reduce potential flood damages on priority basis however the optimization algorithms alone can only search optimal locations of grey infrastructures based on defined hydraulic constraints e g flood volume and flood duration of nodes without considering the significance of nearby areas considering this limitation a preliminary selection process is adopted for finding optimum grey infrastructure locations considering flood hotspots and prioritization of nearby land uses a 100 year design rainfall of 2 h duration is selected and simulated for estimation of flood volume and duration at nodes in search of optimal locations the 100 year storm is selected because the chinese government is planning to upgrade existing urban drainage systems up to 50 year or 100 year design return period in the coming decades xu et al 2018a the land use is classified and ranked into five categories total ranges of three evaluation indicators are equally divided into five levels i e maximum minimum 5 and assigned correspondingly to each level score considering five land use classes as represented in table 3 the corresponding evaluation indicator score of each flooding node is recorded the scores of defined evaluation indicators of each flooding node are calculated based on table 3 as shown in table s3 in the supplementary material the top ten flooded nodes with the highest total scores of three evaluation indicators are selected for placement of grey infrastructure as shown in table 4 locating grey infrastructure at flood hotspots or nearby maximizes its benefits by reducing probability of urban flooding to a higher extent compared to its location at a place with lower risk of urban flooding location and maximum proportion of each type of gi i e bioretention cell green roof permeable pavement and rain garden in every sub catchment are planned and designed according to the detailed land use analysis by considering site suitability for green infrastructure installation local gis design and development guidelines and cost information 3 2 optimization of green grey infrastructures optimization of green grey infrastructures is conducted for seven scenarios under different extreme rainfall events e g 5 10 20 and 100 years scenario based optimization approach provides better decision making circumstances for stakeholders especially when there is limited availability of required resources e g green grey infrastructure development areas limited budgets multi stage land use development plans stakeholder preferences and risk attitudes etc for placement of either of green and grey infrastructures or both also when stakeholders need comprehensive information about the trade off of retrofit costs and benefits at different retrofit scales decisions can easily be made based on a scenario based optimization approach when stakeholders need a comprehensive and comparative analysis between one time retrofitting at a larger scale and multi stage retrofitting at a smaller scale the approximate pareto optimal designs of seven scenarios s1 s7 under different system performance indicators are represented correspondingly in fig 4 a c for a 100 year design rainfall event each vertical axis demonstrates the system performance objective and all horizontal lines represent non dominated approximate pareto optimal solutions in total of 200 the complete spectrum of colour represents different retrofit costs calculated based on different retrofit scales with blue being the lowest and red being the highest generally with an increase in retrofit costs in all scenarios the damage costs and outlet peak flows decrease and uds resilience reliability and sustainability increase take s1 as an example where only green infrastructure was considered for replacement of impervious area optimized with a range of retrofit cost of 154 8 185 3 million usd reducing total damage cost of 2473 9 2710 1 million usd and outlet peak flow of 152 9 154 5 m3 s and enhancing system resilience reliability and sustainability of 0 89 0 90 0 49 0 51 37 6 40 6 respectively as shown in fig 4a in comparison to s1 s2 where only grey infrastructure optimized with a range of retrofit cost of 2 2 9 6 million usd far less than compared to s1 produces relatively similar benefits in terms of damage cost reduction of 2414 3 2877 2 million usd however other system performance indicators were comparatively poorer including drainage system resilience reliability and sustainability of 0 85 0 87 0 45 0 52 and 22 0 29 8 respectively as shown in fig 4b however outlet peak flow was significantly reduced with grey infrastructure s2 implementation compared to green infrastructure s1 and has a range of 137 3 152 6 m3 s the comparative assessment of s1 and s2 represents that both scenarios have similar potential for flood damage reduction however s2 is highly cost effective and has a larger influence on control of outlet peak flow compared to s1 while s1 ensures comparatively better improvement in system functionality and reliability considering the benefits of s1 and s2 these scenarios were combined into s3 s3 significantly reduced damage cost with a range of 1547 4 2032 0 million usd by investing a range of relatively lesser amount of 156 6 199 4 million usd fig 4c compared to combined damage costs and investments of s1 and s2 moreover other system performance indicators resilience reliability and sustainability also showed relative improvements while a significant improvement in the reduction of outlet peak flow is observed 137 5 147 9 m3 s the subsequent scenarios s4 s7 represent a comparison of benefits in terms of damage cost and outlet peak flow reduction system functionality improvement with different levels of investments by retrofitting different scales of green and grey infrastructures fig 5 a d for example comparison of s4 fig 5a and s5 fig 5b represents that s5 is more cost effective than s4 by comparing their costs and benefits it may be because of higher percentage of grey infrastructure in s5 produces higher ratio of benefits over cost in comparison to s4 furthermore s6 and s7 provides further explanation of comparative analysis of optimization scenarios with different levels of configurations for better understanding of benefits against retrofitting costs as shown in fig 5c and 5d it is also important to note that combined optimization scenarios i e s4 s7 with their higher retrofitting scales fig 5 produces far larger benefits compared to individual and combined optimization scenarios i e s1 s3 with lower retrofitting scales fig 4 multiple optimal designs of green grey infrastructures with various retrofitting scales improve the understanding of decision makers and stakeholders of their combined benefits under different configurations and they can prioritize and select any of the most appropriate optimal designs for implementation considering various factors including budget availability space availability for green grey infrastructures development local stakeholders preferences and their attitudes towards urban flood risk reduction urban planning design and development stages and significance of outlet peak flow control apart from these factors other influencing factors can also be included or varied depending upon the nature of the case study for example extreme climatic patterns local green grey infrastructures design guidelines and rules etc 3 3 decision making for selection of optimal designs topsis is a decision making tool used for the selection of one optimal design among all in each scenario s1 s7 considering the significance of each performance indicator the significance of each performance indicator is calculated by estimating their entropy weights for all scenarios in order to avoid subjectivity in the decision making process table 5 represents values of performance indicators of selected optimal designs of different scenarios with their topsis scores and rankings the decision making procedure considers all performance indicators during selection process and its results reveal that s2 ranked at first place followed by s5 s4 and the remaining four scenarios ranked as s1 s6 s7 and s3 respectively with comparison of selected optimal designs between s1 and s2 it is important to mention that a larger reduction in damage cost 23 6 and outlet peak flow 10 4 estimated for s2 compared to s1 having damage cost 21 2 and outlet peak flow 0 1 which is calculated with reference to base case scenario as shown in fig 6 moreover s1 and s2 optimal designs need retrofit costs of 184 8 million usd and 9 6 million usd which indicates s2 is highly cost effective than s1 as represented in table 5 in contrast s2 optimal design showed poorer performance for resilience and sustainability improvement compared to s1 these results indicate that selected optimal designs may have different potentials towards different system performance indicators however it is now the decision maker s responsibility to examine and select optimal design prioritizing target system performance indicators and available retrofit cost by comparison of s1 and s2 with s3 s3 produces higher benefits in terms of reduction in damage cost 39 4 and outlet peak flow 4 2 and enhancement in system resilience 5 1 reliability 24 1 and sustainability 2 5 respectively by investing retrofit cost of 176 1 million usd which is less than the combined retrofit cost of s1 and s2 or even less than s1 individual retrofit cost it is inferred from these results that green and grey infrastructures advantages increase during their combined implementation considering construction costs and target design benefits with comparison of s4 with s3 double s4 s retrofit costs lead to a significant increase in s4 s advantages but relatively less than double s3 s advantages moreover comparing s5 with s4 no significant improvements in benefits of s5 compared to s4 are noted with additional expansion of its storage volume it is reasonable to explain that additional storage volume in s5 could not further increase benefits because required detention volume for storage of overflow flood volume at target flood hotspots has already been fully exploited in s4 and additional storage volume in s5 may not significantly be contributed at grey infrastructure locations the comparison of s6 and s7 represents trade off between retrofit costs and target design benefits where the higher proportion of gi in s7 produces significantly larger benefits in terms of damage cost reduction and system functionality enhancements compared to s6 with larger investments in s7 compared to s6 3 4 system performance evaluation of selected optimal designs at different return periods the selected optimal designs of different scenarios are evaluated under different design rainfall conditions to understand how retrofit costs and other system performance indicators vary with respect to variations in storm magnitude as shown in fig 7 results reveal that selected optimal designs of s1 and s2 represent minor differences between their investments of different return periods i e individual implementation of green grey infrastructures lower retrofit scale fig 7a and interestingly a significant variation in damage costs of corresponding return periods is observed fig 7b however while in case of s4 s7 i e combined implementation of green grey infrastructures higher retrofit scale an opposite trend of retrofit costs for lower to higher return periods are noted and corresponding damage costs showed comparatively less variation with respect to s1 and s2 these results highlight three important aspects 1 lower scale retrofitting designs of green and grey infrastructures with their individual implementations configurations have limited capability to reduce damages of higher design rainfall return periods as they exceed its target design goals 2 higher scale retrofitting designs of combined green grey infrastructures are more effective for lower and higher design rainfall return periods as these designs have larger potential for infiltration and storage of stormwater which can be utilized at its maximum potential for higher storms 3 cost effectiveness of green grey infrastructures is increased for lower to higher return periods because green grey infrastructures utilized its higher infiltration and storage capacities in return of benefits at higher return periods compared to lower comparative assessment of lower and higher retrofit scale designs under different configurations and design rainfall return periods explain that designing and implementation of green grey infrastructures is more cost effective for higher storms compared to lower considering trade off between investments and benefits moreover other system performance indicators including uds resilience reliability and sustainability consistently reduced from lower to higher rainfall return periods in all scenarios while outlet peak flow increased 4 further discussion and implications optimal designing and implementation of green grey infrastructures for stormwater management is a complex and challenging process because of multiple influencing factors including historical and future climatic conditions urban land use development rate population growth aging infrastructure locally available resources and economic budget stakeholders preferences urban flood risk history etc ferrans et al 2022 islam et al 2021 ruangpan et al 2020 shishegar et al 2018 webber and samaras 2022 zhang and chui 2018 considering the above mentioned factors it certainly becomes hard for an alone optimization method to answer the following questions which type of gi and how much of its proportion should be retrofitted in each sub catchment based on available land uses and future urban land development plans what would be optimal positions and volume of grey infrastructures for reduction of specific full urban flood damages how single and combined green and grey infrastructure configurations with different retrofit scales perform for urban flood damage reduction and system functionality improvement cristiano et al 2021 eckart et al 2017 gimenez maranges et al 2020 a combined optimization and decision making framework is developed in this study which precisely selects optimal positions of detention tanks and maximum retrofit scale of each gi type in each sub catchment based on comprehensive land use analysis as a preliminary step before optimization following by decision making is performed for the selection of optimal designs based on defined system performance indicators comparative optimization results of individual green and grey infrastructures provide evidence that grey infrastructure is more cost effective than green infrastructure has larger control on outlet peak flow and has significant potential for flood damage reduction however green infrastructure is relatively better for improvement in system s functional operational performance considering optimization objective functions of this study i e minimizing life cycle cost minimizing flood damage cost maximizing system resilience both infrastructures have proved their pros and cons with respect to defined objectives a comprehensive evaluation and optimization of coupled green grey infrastructures under various design configurations are performed to evaluate trade off between benefits and costs results pertinently explain that collective implementation of both infrastructures synchronizes their advantages by providing higher benefits against lower costs in comparison to their individual implementations these results are supported by previous research studies alves et al 2019 alves et al 2020 leng et al 2021 martínez et al 2021 xu et al 2019 yao et al 2022 where both green and grey infrastructure represent alternative benefits however their coupled application proved as the best adaptation strategy in terms of benefits improvement i e flood damage reduction system functionality and water quality improvement and retrofit costs reduction decision making process ranks and selects the best optimal designs based on defined system performance indicators and number of available optimal solutions raei et al 2019 results provide evidence that individual grey infrastructure optimal design is more cost effective than green infrastructure and both have limited capacities for flood damage reduction and system functionality improvement however combined implementation of green grey infrastructures is more cost effective than their individual applications and this strategy enhances their benefits compared to individuals through decentralized based stormwater infiltration i e on site stormwater management in each sub catchment followed by storage at nearby located grey infrastructure this approach helps to reduce the probability of urban flood risk by minimizing chances of synchronization of peak flow and exceedance of stormwater to uds capacity in addition evaluation of green grey infrastructures with various configurations retrofit scales under different rainstorm scenarios proved a higher benefit over cost ratio for higher design storms compared to lower because of the higher rate of infiltration and storage volumes in higher storms compared to lower resultantly green grey infrastructure s retrofit scale should be carefully designed considering target design benefits availability of budget and space and urban development plan e g development stages in order to avoid consequences of over design i e costly or under design i e flood problems comparative results of green and grey infrastructures presented in this research may be different from other studies because of differences in economic parameters of retrofit costs and flood damage costs however the framework established in this study can be generalized and applied for optimization and decision making of green grey infrastructures the multi objective optimization based decision making framework presented in this study can be extended in future research studies by including stakeholders involvement to incorporate their perceptions opinions for urban flood risk reduction and green grey infrastructures implementation for consideration and evaluation of the impact of subjectivity in the decisions on planning design and development of green grey infrastructures 5 summary and conclusions this study established a multi objective decision making based framework for planning and implementing green grey infrastructures to reduce flood damages and improve uds resilience in this developed framework the green grey infrastructures is designed in three stages including 1 a preliminary assessment of both types of infrastructures 2 optimization of locations and sizes volumes of both infrastructures and 3 selection of optimal designs based on system performance indicators by using a decision making method comparative evaluation of the optimal design results of green and grey infrastructures concludes that grey infrastructure is more cost effective and has relatively better potential for reduction in flood damages and outlet peak flow compared to green infrastructure however green infrastructure significantly performs better than grey infrastructure in the enhancement of system performance indicators i e uds resilience reliability and sustainability furthermore comparison of the combined green grey infrastructures implementation with individual application scenarios demonstrates significant improvement in their benefits in coupled approach compared to their individual scenarios in this regard the combined implementation strategy has been proved to be the most cost effective compared to their individual implementations with various design configurations retrofit scales meanwhile the cost effectiveness of coupled green grey infrastructures can be enhanced from low to high intensity storms because of the higher rate of utilization of stormwater infiltration and storage capacities of both infrastructures from this point of view the combined implementation of both green and grey infrastructure is recommended for future urban land use development plans to control stormwater in the studied uds however it is also noted that their retrofit scales should be carefully decided considering the availability of resources including economic budget and required space urban development and climatic projections population growth and target design goals based on the findings of this study future research direction is recommended to include the quantification of stakeholders preferences and attitudes towards green grey infrastructures development and urban flood risk reduction for a more realistic assessment for practical implementations

1997,algal blooms that have substantial adverse effects are becoming increasingly prevalent in reservoirs especially under global warming and eutrophication conditions in the last decade the essential role of hydrodynamic conditions on algal growth has been widely recognized inducing unfavorable hydrodynamic environments for algal growth through reservoir operations is considered an efficient low cost and clean method for controlling algal blooms in reservoirs however systematic reviews of the hydrodynamic mechanisms on algal blooms and the application of reservoir operation strategies for bloom control have not been proposed yet significantly hampering progress in the field and practical applications to address this problem the author first reviewed relevant literature and concluded that enhancing direct hydrodynamic effects including flow velocity water turbulence and shear stress could inhibit algal growth while intensifying indirect hydrodynamic effects including water retention stratification nutrient distribution and light distribution could promote algal blooms in reservoirs the author then classified reservoir operation strategies into basic reservoir operation selective withdrawal operation and multi objective optimal operation and pointed out that the latter could be key to practical engineering applications moreover hypolimnetic withdrawal might be a long term prevention strategy for controlling algal blooms because it removes internal nutrient load and alters water stratification while epilimnetic withdrawal which flushes away algae in upper layers may be an emergency measure finally the author highlighted the challenges and opportunities associated with the governing hydrodynamic mechanisms for algal growth the coupled effects of hydrodynamics and other environmental factors nutrient cycling processes underwater light distribution key reference indexes short term reservoir operation strategies withdrawal elevation optimization and the internal mechanism driving the optimal operation for algal bloom control this study identified the advances and gaps in the field and envisioned the potential directions for future research keywords algal bloom direct hydrodynamic condition indirect hydrodynamic condition reservoir operation strategy selective withdrawal multi objective optimal operation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction under ongoing global warming and anthropogenic activities harmful algal blooms are becoming increasingly frequent in freshwater reservoirs glibert 2020 huang et al 2020 li et al 2022b algal blooms which are the excessive proliferation of phytoplankton or bacteria can not only cause fish kills oxygen depletion and ecological degradation but can also degrade water quality in water sources and more severely threaten public health e g lung disease and cancer through the food chain gorham et al 2020 lad et al 2022 metcalf et al 2021 zohdi and abbaspour 2019 in 2016 2018 18 states in the united states reported 421 harmful algal bloom events 389 cases of human illnesses and 413 cases of animal illnesses roberts et al 2020 more severely in 2019 32 steers died in the junipers reservoir in the united states after drinking water containing cyanobacterial toxins dreher et al 2019 unfortunately global reservoirs and lakes particularly in developing countries are increasingly at risk from long lasting and widespread harmful algal blooms fang et al 2022 hou et al 2022 maniyar et al 2022 in response to the algal bloom crisis crucial environmental factors for algal growth should be thoroughly investigated in addition to nutrients light and temperature over the past decade scientists have become increasingly aware that hydrodynamic conditions can significantly affect algal bloom development in reservoirs de oliveira et al 2020 ji et al 2017 mao et al 2015 dam construction substantially changes the hydrodynamic conditions of natural rivers causing considerable changes in the essential hydrological characteristics and biogeochemical cycling of these aquatic ecosystems generally artificial reservoirs increase water depth reduce flow velocity and cause thermal stratification which promotes nutrient retention and algal growth song et al 2021b moreover hydrodynamic conditions can not only affect algal proliferation through changes in flow velocity water turbulence and transport processes but also influence bloom development by changing the temperature profile water mixing and nutrient distribution li et al 2020 song et al 2018 therefore understanding the hydrodynamic environment which encompasses a set of hydrodynamic conditions is fundamental and crucial for revealing the mechanisms that induce algal blooms in reservoirs due to rapid advances in numerical simulation technologies researchers can effectively assess the impact of hydrodynamic conditions on algal blooms and even develop reservoir operation strategies that lead to hydrodynamic conditions unfavorable for algal growth in reservoirs dehbalaei and javan 2018 song et al 2023b wang et al 2020 compared with physical methods e g algae harvesting sediment dredging and applying water lifting aerators chemical methods e g metal ions and flocculants and biological methods e g algicidal bacteria and silver carp reservoir operation strategies to control algal blooms such as selective withdrawal and horizontal flushing are easy to operate low cost efficient and environmentally friendly gallardo rodríguez et al 2019 herman et al 2017 huang et al 2022 xu et al 2022 in 2011 researchers noted that a wave type water release operation might reduce algal bloom frequencies in a tributary of the three gorges reservoir tgr china zheng et al 2011 since then this reservoir operation strategy has been considered a promising method for mitigating algal blooms kim et al 2014 lian et al 2014 ye et al 2022 however due to the dam removal activities prevailing in developed countries and the difficulties associated with interdisciplinary research involving environmental modeling and hydraulic engineering ryan bellmore et al 2017 the use of reservoir operation strategies to mitigate algal blooms remains in its early stages and has few practical applications overall it is crucial and urgent to advance our understanding of the impacts of hydrodynamic conditions on algal blooms and potential reservoir operation strategies however thus far no reviews have been published in this research field therefore in this study a state of the art assessment was conducted in this promising field to improve the understanding of the mechanisms affecting algal bloom control and to promote the application of reservoir operation strategies in this study the author first reviews the influence mechanism of hydrodynamic conditions on algal blooms then discusses the current status of algal bloom control by reservoir operation strategies and finally summarizes the challenges and opportunities this review can serve as a useful guide for future research on the theory and application of the hydrodynamic control of algal blooms in reservoirs 2 mechanisms by which hydrodynamic conditions affect algal blooms in reservoirs typically hydrodynamic conditions have comprehensive and complex effects on algal growth and bloom development to systematically review the hydrodynamic impacts on algal blooms in reservoirs hydrodynamic conditions are categorized into seven representative indicators flow velocity water turbulence shear stress water residence time stratification light distribution and nutrient distribution a comprehensive literature search was conducted using the above themes and keywords in the scopus database in january 2023 fig 1 the search criteria are described in detail in the supplementary material table s1 on a global scale the number of publications related to the effects of hydrodynamic conditions on algal blooms in reservoirs has risen sharply since 2013 fig 1a china ranks first in the number of publications in this field followed by the united states fig 1b this might be because a substantial number of hydropower stations exist in china and the total installed capacity of hydropower was over 280 gw approximately 22 5 of the global share by the end of 2013 sun et al 2019 due to this trend environmental risks have been continuously increasing in reservoirs for example algal blooms began to occur frequently in a landmark project in china the tgr lian et al 2014 yang et al 2010 yang et al 2013 zhang et al 2010 meanwhile the importance of hydrodynamic conditions has been increasingly recognized by scientists in previous studies thermal stratification has received the most attention while the least amount of attention has been given to shear stress fig 1c based on the form of action of the hydrodynamic conditions fig 2 the direct impacts of hydrodynamic conditions on algal cells were further classified as flow velocity water turbulence and shear stress while the indirect impacts were categorized as water retention stratification nutrient distribution and light distribution thus the mechanism by which hydrodynamic conditions influence algal blooms could be systematically summarized and the specific effects could be thoroughly examined fig 3 2 1 direct effects of hydrodynamic conditions on algal blooms 2 1 1 flow velocity flow velocity is a commonly used parameter to study the hydrodynamic impacts on algal blooms as it is the most representative of hydrodynamic conditions intuitively flow velocity characterizes how rapidly water moves and this can directly influence the algal distribution and transport fig 2 and fig 3 extensive literature research indicates that a high flow velocity disturbs algal aggregation and inhibits algal growth while a moderate or low flow velocity promotes algal blooms huang et al 2015 li et al 2013 matson et al 2020 xin et al 2020 zhu et al 2019b it is also well known that optimum velocities for algal growth usually less than 0 3 m s 1 exist and these vary with algal species nutrient levels and regions kim et al 2018 li et al 2021a reaver et al 2019 song et al 2018 wang et al 2016 furthermore researchers have incorporated this low promoting and high inhibiting velocity effect into algal growth equations to improve algal bloom simulations jian et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 while flow velocity is an easy concept to understand and measure it is a macroscopic and broad factor and cannot directly reflect the internal mechanism by which water flow affects algal growth song et al 2018 thus researchers still need to identify more intrinsic and essential representations of water flow to describe the specific effects of hydrodynamic conditions on algal cells 2 1 2 water turbulence compared with flow velocity water turbulence and shear stress reflect flow characteristics more thoroughly and intrinsically especially in the microscopic hydrodynamic environment surrounding algal cells and they impact algal growth more directly and specifically fig 2 sengupta et al 2017 wang and lan 2018 previous studies have shown that moderate water turbulence can facilitate algal growth mainly by promoting nutrient uptake and energy metabolism fig 3 san et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 in contrast high water turbulence inhibits algal growth by causing cell destruction and preventing colony formation fig 3 kang et al 2019 liu et al 2019 the author has proposed the batchelor microscale to quantitatively explore the nutrient uptake of algal cells under turbulence and demonstrated that moderate water turbulence can improve nutrient availability by turbulent diffusion song et al 2018 collectively researchers prefer to use turbulent dissipation rates to quantify turbulence and the optimum thresholds for algal growth broadly vary from 10 7 to 1 m2 s 3 depending on algal species and environmental conditions arnott et al 2021 song et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 the interaction mechanisms between water turbulence and algal cells are difficult to accurately elucidate due to the disorder in water turbulence and the multiple physical processes involved for instance turbulence triggers strong microscale patchiness of motile algae durham et al 2013 small scale turbulence at the water surface was found to play an important role in microcystis surface scum formation wu et al 2019 water turbulence can also affect the encounter rates of predators and prey thereby influencing zooplankton growth mixotrophic algae growth and autotrophic algae growth garcía portela et al 2019 li et al 2022a marrasé et al 1990 song et al 2021b notably researchers have found that phytoplankton can actively diversify the direction of migration to avoid strong turbulence carrara et al 2021 sengupta et al 2017 furthermore recent studies have reported that turbulence intensity and nutrients synergistically affect algal growth zhao et al 2020 for example abundant nitrogen availability can weaken the inhibitory effect of strong turbulence on algal biomass cui et al 2022 which indicates that the algae turbulence interaction is highly complex and requires further exploration 2 1 3 shear stress shear stress can have significant ecological implications for the resuspension and distribution of algae and nutrients in reservoirs bai et al 2019 chen et al 2018 serra et al 2007 furthermore due to the viscosity of actual fluids water flow can directly and inherently exert a shear force on algae cells which has been severely ignored in reservoir studies fig 1c and fig 2 thus in addition to in situ field studies extensive laboratory studies were reviewed and it was concluded that shear stress can affect cell morphology antioxidation systems enzyme activity and photosynthetic activity in algae cells fig 3 duman et al 2021 mitsuhashi et al 1994 song et al 2018 wang and lan 2018 excessive shear stress can trigger the production of reactive oxygen species causing severe cell damage and inhibiting algal growth gao et al 2018b rodríguez et al 2009 for example the growth of isochrysis galbana skeletonema costatum and chaetoceros muelleri was severely inhibited under 1 2 5 4 pa shear stress michels et al 2016 on the other hand researchers have shown that shear stress can stimulate physiological processes including photosynthesis and growth in algal cells and an optimum shear stress exists for algal growth leupold et al 2013 hydrodynamic shear probably disrupts the vertical migration of algae and hence results in the formation of thin algae layers which can seed harmful algal blooms durham et al 2009 although researchers have focused on the individual effects of shear stress on algae cells it should be noted that shear stress water turbulence and flow velocity are closely coupled consequently distinguishing and quantifying the effects of different hydrodynamic indicators and determining the leading factors should be the focus of future research 2 2 indirect effects of hydrodynamic conditions on algal blooms 2 2 1 water retention water retention also represented by water retention time residence time flushing time water age or water exchange is a prevalent and critical concept that primarily characterizes how long water or dissolved substances remain in a reservoir rueda et al 2006 fundamentally water retention is influenced by hydrodynamic conditions such as flow velocity and flow field thus water retention is a representative of the indirect hydrodynamic conditions in reservoirs previous studies have reached a consensus that water retention plays a vital role in algal biomass levels and accumulation and enhanced water retention is considered favorable for bloom development fig 3 burford et al 2007 gao et al 2018a soares et al 2008 song et al 2023b reducing water retention time and enhancing water exchange via reservoir operations can inhibit algal blooms cheng et al 2019 chuo et al 2019 however since water retention is affected by the defined boundaries and varies tremendously in different study sites it is not recommended as a universal approach for algal bloom control in reservoirs 2 2 2 stratification to date thermal stratification and its positive effects on phytoplankton growth have received the most attention in reservoirs fig 1c he et al 2019 li et al 2015 rigosi and rueda 2012 xu et al 2021a the stratification caused by dam construction and surface water heating indicates that the water column is relatively stable in the vertical direction fig 2 thus stratified water columns can weaken vertical mixing and hinder material exchange which essentially helps algae especially cyanobacteria migrate to the upper warmer waters to absorb light and proliferate fig 3 amorim and moura 2021 raine et al 2018 song et al 2021b for example stratified flow affected algal transport and might be a crucial driver in algal blooms in a tributary bay of the tgr li et al 2021b wind induced langmuir circulation may change surface mixing and hence affect the vertical distribution and aggregation of algae buranathanitt et al 1982 however there is relatively limited research on this topic additionally stratification is often accompanied by long water residence times and low flow velocities which collectively promote algal blooms this implies that different hydrodynamic effects can be synergistic azadi et al 2021 soares et al 2008 by linking thermal stratification and primary productivity in water columns critical depth theory hypothesizes that algal blooms occur when the surface mixed layer is shallower than a critical depth which defines the point at which algal growth exceeds losses sathyendranath et al 2015 sverdrup 1953 van ruth et al 2010 in terms of the mechanism of algal blooms the classical critical depth theory is widely used and has had a long lasting influence obata et al 1996 yang et al 2022 previous studies have reported that enhancing vertical mixing to disrupt stratification also called destratification can carry algae to deep and cold waters thus discouraging bloom development in reservoirs huang et al 2019 song et al 2021b 2 2 3 nutrient distribution nutrients including nitrogen phosphorous silica etc are essential environmental factors for algal blooms and have consistently attracted substantial research interest in terms of algal blooms in reservoirs it can be concluded that hydrodynamic conditions mainly alter nutrient transport and release thus regulating the nutrient distribution and availability for algal cells fig 2 and fig 3 ishikawa et al 2022 li et al 2018 yang et al 2018 for instance previous research has revealed that enhancing nutrient transport from the xiangxi bay tributary to the tgr mainstream could alleviate spring algal blooms in the tributary lang et al 2019 most recently researchers reported that algal growth in the near dam region of a brazilian reservoir was dominated by nutrient release from sediments especially when water levels were low and strong water turbulence existed near the sediment bed ishikawa et al 2022 in addition they found that the inflow nutrients were mainly consumed in the upstream region of the reservoir and did not pollute water quality downstream and in the tributaries these physical processes differ from a previous study that nutrients in the mainstream of the tgr could be carried into xiangxi bay through density currents yang et al 2018 thus different reservoirs may have distinct flow patterns and nutrient cycling processes and a case by case analysis is necessary to determine the nutrient driven mechanisms of algal bloom formations 2 2 4 light distribution another crucial driver in the formation of algal blooms in reservoirs is light distribution because irradiance is essential to phytoplankton photosynthesis fig 2 previous studies have shown that hydrodynamic mixing can facilitate algal cells exposed to light intermittently and promote algal growth fig 3 hadiyanto et al 2013 sarat chandra et al 2017 zhu et al 2019a nevertheless little attention has been given to the effects of flow conditions such as sedimentation and resuspension on underwater light distribution moreover compared with stratification and nutrients the role of light distribution on algal growth has largely been ignored in reservoirs this might be because solar radiation is a factor that cannot be controlled and is typically assumed to be suitable for algal growth when a bloom occurs in fact building a dam inevitably slows flow velocity increases water depth and leads to suspended matter sedimentation in the near dam region which collectively increase transparency and enhance underwater light intensity li et al 2018 subsequently a favorable light distribution exists in the near dam region and this can effectively promote algae to utilize light potentially serving as a precondition for algal blooms song et al 2021b in light of these circumstances researchers should further explore how hydrodynamic conditions influence light distribution attenuation and consequently affect algal growth in reservoirs 3 application of reservoir operation strategies for algal bloom control clarifying the mechanisms by which hydrodynamic conditions affect algal growth provides a crucial theoretical basis for creating an unfavorable hydrodynamic environment for algal blooms through reservoir operation strategies the relevant literature on algal bloom control using reservoir operation strategies was reviewed in the scopus database in january 2023 table s2 and fig 4 the results demonstrated that not much attention was given to the topic since the total number of publications was relatively small fig 4a china and the united states were the top countries in the number of publications on the topic fig 4b to systematically summarize the research status and provide explicit directions for future research the literature was classified into three categories basic reservoir operations selective withdrawal operations and multi objective optimal operations table 1 although each research category has a specific emphasis the three research categories are complementary table 1 the detailed descriptions are as follows 3 1 basic reservoir operations the first defined category is basic regular reservoir operations which focuses on regulating water release at a common fixed outflow height to adjust the hydrodynamic conditions to be unsuitable for algal growth studies of this category typically reveal the effects of reservoir operation processes on algal blooms for example previous studies reported that maintaining low water levels during the period when algal blooms tend to occur could control algal blooms in the burrinjuck reservoir and zipingpu reservoir table 1 lawrence et al 2000 song et al 2023b regardless of the water level variation types such as tide type and stair type fluctuations the intrinsic principle for controlling algal bloom is to disturb stratification reduce nutrients and enhance flow velocity and water exchange through reservoir operation strategies table 1 sha et al 2015 song et al 2021b yang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 the key reference indexes and their thresholds for controlling algal blooms are less studied which impedes the practical application of reservoir operation strategies although some researchers have proposed that the ratio of mixing layer depth and euphotic layer depth and the depth averaged velocity could be potential reference indexes in the tgr and the zipingpu reservoir ji et al 2017 song et al 2023b yang et al 2022 yang et al 2018 practical engineering verification and generalizations have not been reported to date the time scale for the application of reservoir operation strategies for bloom mitigation has primarily been long term spanning months chuo et al 2019 ji et al 2017 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2013 in addition most studies have focused on controlling algal blooms in the tributaries of the tgr table 1 these phenomena indicate that efficient and short term emergency reservoir operations for algal bloom control are still unavailable notably global warming and eutrophication can induce more widespread and frequent blooms glibert 2020 song et al 2021a thus the focus of future studies may need to shift to mitigating algal blooms on a large spatial scale such as blooms in both the mainstream and the tributaries of the zipingpu reservoir and the sanbanxi reservoir he et al 2019 song et al 2021b 3 2 selective withdrawal operation some reservoirs have multilevel intake facilities which provide opportunities to carry out selective withdrawal operations to restore water quality and mitigate algal blooms on the one hand researchers initially proposed hypolimnetic withdrawal instead of epilimnetic outflow to remove nutrients particularly phosphorous from the hypolimnion to downstream in north american and european lakes herman et al 2017 nürnberg 1987 nürnberg 2007 on the other hand some studies have also argued that surface or upper or metalimnetic withdrawal could flush away algae and reduce upward hypolimnetic phosphorus dispersion table 1 barbiero et al 1997 mi et al 2022 zouabi aloui et al 2015 song et al 2023a thus performing selective withdrawal to prevent algal blooms requires careful analysis of local conditions for example hypolimnetic withdrawal may not apply to a reservoir that does not form stable stratification or a nutrient enriched deep water layer nürnberg 2020 it is also worth noting that hypolimnetic withdrawal may not be an effective method for controlling algal species such as microcystis which thrive with higher n p ratios and require a more integrated and efficient approach lehman et al 2009 regarding the mechanisms of action the author believes deep withdrawal can remove the internal nutrient load thereby serving as a long term prevention measure while shallow withdrawal may serve as a promising emergency measure for controlling algal blooms since selective withdrawal operations introduce outlet locations as an extra variable to basic reservoir operations it is necessary to simultaneously consider the impacts of outflow discharge and elevation on algal blooms in addition due to rapid improvements in computing power coupling selective withdrawal operations with optimization algorithms to obtain the optimal withdrawal depth or strategy for improving water quality has gained increasing attention haghighat et al 2021 saadatpour et al 2021 3 3 multi objective optimal operations in addition to algal bloom control realistic reservoir operations should also take regular benefits such as flood prevention power generation and navigation into account balancing and optimizing the different benefits of reservoir operations is a difficult challenge to address this problem and promote the application of algal bloom control through reservoir operations researchers have proposed multi objective optimal operations and these have shown excellent potential in reservoirs table 1 specifically most studies have revealed distinct tradeoffs between algal bloom control and hydropower generation in reservoirs he et al 2022 hu et al 2014 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021b this occurs because dramatic fluctuations in water levels especially rapid declines could increase water exchange weaken stratification and inhibit algal blooms while decreasing hydropower generation he et al 2020 lian et al 2014 wang et al 2020 while some researchers have reported that conducting ecological operations may slightly improve flood control and shipping benefits the study area was limited to the tgr and the transferability of the findings is unclear hu et al 2016 hu et al 2014 previous studies typically used the statistical relationships between water quality and reservoir operation information to preliminarily assess algal bloom risks which was primarily data driven and computationally efficient hu et al 2014 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021b however this method does not provide dynamic and physical insights into the algal bloom formation process and lacks the theoretical justifications for performing various reservoir operation strategies which severely hampers practical applications due to rapid advances in computing power coupling a process based physics model and an optimization algorithm is conducive to resolving multi objective optimization problems and revealing the internal mechanism of algal bloom control in reservoirs haghighat et al 2021 he et al 2022 tarabih et al 2023 4 challenges and opportunities 4 1 hydrodynamic impacts on algal blooms the current research on hydrodynamic impacts on algal blooms is relatively limited compared with other essential factors such as nutrients temperature and light there is a widespread belief that strong hydrodynamic effects inhibit algal growth but the mechanisms by which hydrodynamic conditions affect algal growth are complex and not fully understood huang et al 2022 sha et al 2015 song et al 2021b regarding the direct effects of hydrodynamic conditions it is necessary to differentiate and quantify the effects of flow velocity water turbulence and shear stress on algal growth through systematic experiments and sophisticated numerical simulations table 2 by proceeding in this way the leading factor and governing mechanism for algal bloom control could be identified and the following questions could be answered which hydrodynamic indicator is most sensitive to algal cells is preventing colony formation through strong turbulence more effective than disturbing the antioxidation system by considerable shear stress for inhibiting algal blooms notably the availability of abundant amounts of nutrients could offset the inhibitory effect of strong water turbulence indicating that the influencing mechanisms of hydrodynamic conditions are exceptionally complex cui et al 2022 therefore in future research the coupled impacts of hydrodynamic conditions nutrients light and temperature should be examined to accurately explain the algal bloom process compared with the direct effects the indirect impacts of hydrodynamic conditions on algal growth are more significant and well studied especially in reservoirs from previous research it was principally concluded that 1 a short water residence time causes inhibitory effects on algal blooms 2 weakening stratification negatively affects algal growth however the effects of hydrodynamic conditions on nutrient and light distributions are seldom investigated in reservoirs table 2 this might be because different reservoirs have distinct hydrological and topographic conditions which lead to different nutrient cycling patterns that are complex and hard to observe and simulate ishikawa et al 2022 li et al 2018 therefore high frequency in situ monitoring and state of the art simulations of water quality and flow fields are greatly needed to determine nutrient transport and release and the subsequent effects on algal growth in reservoirs moreover algal blooms are consistently detected at the water surface where light conditions are favorable the effects of hydrodynamic conditions on underwater algal growth and light distribution are typically ignored the euphotic zone depth is critical for algal growth and its relationship with the mixing layer depth can to some extent dominate bloom outbreaks song et al 2021b yang et al 2022 thus applying critical depth theory to analyze algal bloom formation and control might be a research trend in reservoirs 4 2 using reservoir operation strategies to control algal blooms although some progress has been made in using reservoir operation strategies to control algal blooms such as weakening stratification and enhancing water exchange the key reference indexes for reservoir operation practices remain unclear table 2 this can be attributed to the fact that related research is limited and insufficient and engineering applications are severely lacking moreover the current reservoir operation strategies are mostly long term and focus on mitigating algal blooms in the tributaries of the tgr table 1 thus it is necessary to conduct extensive research to determine the key reference indexes and develop short term emergency reservoir operation strategies to guide practical application song et al 2023b selective withdrawal has shown the potential ability to alleviate eutrophication and control algal blooms in reservoirs however determining a feasible withdrawal elevation such as deep withdrawal or shallow withdrawal can be a challenge for reservoir managers table 2 for example reservoirs that do not exhibit stable stratification may not be suitable for nutrient removal through deep withdrawal nürnberg 2020 thus the effects of selective withdrawal on algal blooms and the key inhibitory effects still need to be further investigated on the other hand both the outflow rate and elevation should be considered during selective withdrawal and this requires optimization algorithms to determine the optimal withdrawal strategies for algal bloom control in reservoirs the tradeoffs between algal bloom control and hydropower generation in reservoirs are widely recognized thus optimization models have been proposed to resolve tradeoffs among the different reservoir benefits nonetheless the relationships between algal bloom control and regular reservoir benefits such as water supply and navigation are less studied table 2 furthermore in previous studies researchers have mainly focused on evaluating the results of the multi objective optimization model to alleviate eutrophication xu et al 2021b yosefipoor et al 2022 the underlying physical processes and internal mechanisms have not been fully explored coupling a physics model and an optimization model with highly efficient parallel computing may be a promising solution for the future table 2 5 conclusions although the research on the hydrodynamic mechanisms on algal blooms is advancing the main achievements and bottlenecks have not been recognized this study classifies the hydrodynamic influences as direct and indirect effects to systematically evaluate the research progress and gaps through literature investigation it was primarily concluded that enhancing direct hydrodynamic effects including flow velocity water turbulence and shear stress is unfavorable for algal blooms in reservoirs but enhancing indirect hydrodynamic effects including water retention stratification nutrient distribution and light distribution has the opposite effect even so substantial challenges exist in determining the leading hydrodynamic factors and governing mechanisms for algal bloom control the fundamental research on the coupled effects of hydrodynamic conditions and other essential environmental factors is still in its infancy moreover the effects of nutrient cycling and light distribution on algal blooms in reservoirs are incredibly complex and have not received sufficient attention the use of reservoir operation strategies to mitigate algal blooms has not been fully investigated probably due to the complex and unclear mechanisms governing algal blooms in reservoirs to conduct a systematic review the author categorized the research status into three main areas basic reservoir operations selective withdrawal operations and multi objective optimal operations the theoretical basis for implementing reservoir operations for bloom control is to create an unfavorable hydrodynamic environment selective withdrawal has the potential to control algal blooms in both long term and short term ways emerging multi objective optimal operations can significantly promote the practical application of reservoir operation strategies however more information is needed on the following topics the key reference indexes the emergency reservoir operations the optimal withdrawal elevation the relationships between algal bloom control and regular reservoir benefits and the ecological processes and physical mechanisms under the optimal reservoir operation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment yang song acknowledges the editors and

1997,algal blooms that have substantial adverse effects are becoming increasingly prevalent in reservoirs especially under global warming and eutrophication conditions in the last decade the essential role of hydrodynamic conditions on algal growth has been widely recognized inducing unfavorable hydrodynamic environments for algal growth through reservoir operations is considered an efficient low cost and clean method for controlling algal blooms in reservoirs however systematic reviews of the hydrodynamic mechanisms on algal blooms and the application of reservoir operation strategies for bloom control have not been proposed yet significantly hampering progress in the field and practical applications to address this problem the author first reviewed relevant literature and concluded that enhancing direct hydrodynamic effects including flow velocity water turbulence and shear stress could inhibit algal growth while intensifying indirect hydrodynamic effects including water retention stratification nutrient distribution and light distribution could promote algal blooms in reservoirs the author then classified reservoir operation strategies into basic reservoir operation selective withdrawal operation and multi objective optimal operation and pointed out that the latter could be key to practical engineering applications moreover hypolimnetic withdrawal might be a long term prevention strategy for controlling algal blooms because it removes internal nutrient load and alters water stratification while epilimnetic withdrawal which flushes away algae in upper layers may be an emergency measure finally the author highlighted the challenges and opportunities associated with the governing hydrodynamic mechanisms for algal growth the coupled effects of hydrodynamics and other environmental factors nutrient cycling processes underwater light distribution key reference indexes short term reservoir operation strategies withdrawal elevation optimization and the internal mechanism driving the optimal operation for algal bloom control this study identified the advances and gaps in the field and envisioned the potential directions for future research keywords algal bloom direct hydrodynamic condition indirect hydrodynamic condition reservoir operation strategy selective withdrawal multi objective optimal operation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction under ongoing global warming and anthropogenic activities harmful algal blooms are becoming increasingly frequent in freshwater reservoirs glibert 2020 huang et al 2020 li et al 2022b algal blooms which are the excessive proliferation of phytoplankton or bacteria can not only cause fish kills oxygen depletion and ecological degradation but can also degrade water quality in water sources and more severely threaten public health e g lung disease and cancer through the food chain gorham et al 2020 lad et al 2022 metcalf et al 2021 zohdi and abbaspour 2019 in 2016 2018 18 states in the united states reported 421 harmful algal bloom events 389 cases of human illnesses and 413 cases of animal illnesses roberts et al 2020 more severely in 2019 32 steers died in the junipers reservoir in the united states after drinking water containing cyanobacterial toxins dreher et al 2019 unfortunately global reservoirs and lakes particularly in developing countries are increasingly at risk from long lasting and widespread harmful algal blooms fang et al 2022 hou et al 2022 maniyar et al 2022 in response to the algal bloom crisis crucial environmental factors for algal growth should be thoroughly investigated in addition to nutrients light and temperature over the past decade scientists have become increasingly aware that hydrodynamic conditions can significantly affect algal bloom development in reservoirs de oliveira et al 2020 ji et al 2017 mao et al 2015 dam construction substantially changes the hydrodynamic conditions of natural rivers causing considerable changes in the essential hydrological characteristics and biogeochemical cycling of these aquatic ecosystems generally artificial reservoirs increase water depth reduce flow velocity and cause thermal stratification which promotes nutrient retention and algal growth song et al 2021b moreover hydrodynamic conditions can not only affect algal proliferation through changes in flow velocity water turbulence and transport processes but also influence bloom development by changing the temperature profile water mixing and nutrient distribution li et al 2020 song et al 2018 therefore understanding the hydrodynamic environment which encompasses a set of hydrodynamic conditions is fundamental and crucial for revealing the mechanisms that induce algal blooms in reservoirs due to rapid advances in numerical simulation technologies researchers can effectively assess the impact of hydrodynamic conditions on algal blooms and even develop reservoir operation strategies that lead to hydrodynamic conditions unfavorable for algal growth in reservoirs dehbalaei and javan 2018 song et al 2023b wang et al 2020 compared with physical methods e g algae harvesting sediment dredging and applying water lifting aerators chemical methods e g metal ions and flocculants and biological methods e g algicidal bacteria and silver carp reservoir operation strategies to control algal blooms such as selective withdrawal and horizontal flushing are easy to operate low cost efficient and environmentally friendly gallardo rodríguez et al 2019 herman et al 2017 huang et al 2022 xu et al 2022 in 2011 researchers noted that a wave type water release operation might reduce algal bloom frequencies in a tributary of the three gorges reservoir tgr china zheng et al 2011 since then this reservoir operation strategy has been considered a promising method for mitigating algal blooms kim et al 2014 lian et al 2014 ye et al 2022 however due to the dam removal activities prevailing in developed countries and the difficulties associated with interdisciplinary research involving environmental modeling and hydraulic engineering ryan bellmore et al 2017 the use of reservoir operation strategies to mitigate algal blooms remains in its early stages and has few practical applications overall it is crucial and urgent to advance our understanding of the impacts of hydrodynamic conditions on algal blooms and potential reservoir operation strategies however thus far no reviews have been published in this research field therefore in this study a state of the art assessment was conducted in this promising field to improve the understanding of the mechanisms affecting algal bloom control and to promote the application of reservoir operation strategies in this study the author first reviews the influence mechanism of hydrodynamic conditions on algal blooms then discusses the current status of algal bloom control by reservoir operation strategies and finally summarizes the challenges and opportunities this review can serve as a useful guide for future research on the theory and application of the hydrodynamic control of algal blooms in reservoirs 2 mechanisms by which hydrodynamic conditions affect algal blooms in reservoirs typically hydrodynamic conditions have comprehensive and complex effects on algal growth and bloom development to systematically review the hydrodynamic impacts on algal blooms in reservoirs hydrodynamic conditions are categorized into seven representative indicators flow velocity water turbulence shear stress water residence time stratification light distribution and nutrient distribution a comprehensive literature search was conducted using the above themes and keywords in the scopus database in january 2023 fig 1 the search criteria are described in detail in the supplementary material table s1 on a global scale the number of publications related to the effects of hydrodynamic conditions on algal blooms in reservoirs has risen sharply since 2013 fig 1a china ranks first in the number of publications in this field followed by the united states fig 1b this might be because a substantial number of hydropower stations exist in china and the total installed capacity of hydropower was over 280 gw approximately 22 5 of the global share by the end of 2013 sun et al 2019 due to this trend environmental risks have been continuously increasing in reservoirs for example algal blooms began to occur frequently in a landmark project in china the tgr lian et al 2014 yang et al 2010 yang et al 2013 zhang et al 2010 meanwhile the importance of hydrodynamic conditions has been increasingly recognized by scientists in previous studies thermal stratification has received the most attention while the least amount of attention has been given to shear stress fig 1c based on the form of action of the hydrodynamic conditions fig 2 the direct impacts of hydrodynamic conditions on algal cells were further classified as flow velocity water turbulence and shear stress while the indirect impacts were categorized as water retention stratification nutrient distribution and light distribution thus the mechanism by which hydrodynamic conditions influence algal blooms could be systematically summarized and the specific effects could be thoroughly examined fig 3 2 1 direct effects of hydrodynamic conditions on algal blooms 2 1 1 flow velocity flow velocity is a commonly used parameter to study the hydrodynamic impacts on algal blooms as it is the most representative of hydrodynamic conditions intuitively flow velocity characterizes how rapidly water moves and this can directly influence the algal distribution and transport fig 2 and fig 3 extensive literature research indicates that a high flow velocity disturbs algal aggregation and inhibits algal growth while a moderate or low flow velocity promotes algal blooms huang et al 2015 li et al 2013 matson et al 2020 xin et al 2020 zhu et al 2019b it is also well known that optimum velocities for algal growth usually less than 0 3 m s 1 exist and these vary with algal species nutrient levels and regions kim et al 2018 li et al 2021a reaver et al 2019 song et al 2018 wang et al 2016 furthermore researchers have incorporated this low promoting and high inhibiting velocity effect into algal growth equations to improve algal bloom simulations jian et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 while flow velocity is an easy concept to understand and measure it is a macroscopic and broad factor and cannot directly reflect the internal mechanism by which water flow affects algal growth song et al 2018 thus researchers still need to identify more intrinsic and essential representations of water flow to describe the specific effects of hydrodynamic conditions on algal cells 2 1 2 water turbulence compared with flow velocity water turbulence and shear stress reflect flow characteristics more thoroughly and intrinsically especially in the microscopic hydrodynamic environment surrounding algal cells and they impact algal growth more directly and specifically fig 2 sengupta et al 2017 wang and lan 2018 previous studies have shown that moderate water turbulence can facilitate algal growth mainly by promoting nutrient uptake and energy metabolism fig 3 san et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 in contrast high water turbulence inhibits algal growth by causing cell destruction and preventing colony formation fig 3 kang et al 2019 liu et al 2019 the author has proposed the batchelor microscale to quantitatively explore the nutrient uptake of algal cells under turbulence and demonstrated that moderate water turbulence can improve nutrient availability by turbulent diffusion song et al 2018 collectively researchers prefer to use turbulent dissipation rates to quantify turbulence and the optimum thresholds for algal growth broadly vary from 10 7 to 1 m2 s 3 depending on algal species and environmental conditions arnott et al 2021 song et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 the interaction mechanisms between water turbulence and algal cells are difficult to accurately elucidate due to the disorder in water turbulence and the multiple physical processes involved for instance turbulence triggers strong microscale patchiness of motile algae durham et al 2013 small scale turbulence at the water surface was found to play an important role in microcystis surface scum formation wu et al 2019 water turbulence can also affect the encounter rates of predators and prey thereby influencing zooplankton growth mixotrophic algae growth and autotrophic algae growth garcía portela et al 2019 li et al 2022a marrasé et al 1990 song et al 2021b notably researchers have found that phytoplankton can actively diversify the direction of migration to avoid strong turbulence carrara et al 2021 sengupta et al 2017 furthermore recent studies have reported that turbulence intensity and nutrients synergistically affect algal growth zhao et al 2020 for example abundant nitrogen availability can weaken the inhibitory effect of strong turbulence on algal biomass cui et al 2022 which indicates that the algae turbulence interaction is highly complex and requires further exploration 2 1 3 shear stress shear stress can have significant ecological implications for the resuspension and distribution of algae and nutrients in reservoirs bai et al 2019 chen et al 2018 serra et al 2007 furthermore due to the viscosity of actual fluids water flow can directly and inherently exert a shear force on algae cells which has been severely ignored in reservoir studies fig 1c and fig 2 thus in addition to in situ field studies extensive laboratory studies were reviewed and it was concluded that shear stress can affect cell morphology antioxidation systems enzyme activity and photosynthetic activity in algae cells fig 3 duman et al 2021 mitsuhashi et al 1994 song et al 2018 wang and lan 2018 excessive shear stress can trigger the production of reactive oxygen species causing severe cell damage and inhibiting algal growth gao et al 2018b rodríguez et al 2009 for example the growth of isochrysis galbana skeletonema costatum and chaetoceros muelleri was severely inhibited under 1 2 5 4 pa shear stress michels et al 2016 on the other hand researchers have shown that shear stress can stimulate physiological processes including photosynthesis and growth in algal cells and an optimum shear stress exists for algal growth leupold et al 2013 hydrodynamic shear probably disrupts the vertical migration of algae and hence results in the formation of thin algae layers which can seed harmful algal blooms durham et al 2009 although researchers have focused on the individual effects of shear stress on algae cells it should be noted that shear stress water turbulence and flow velocity are closely coupled consequently distinguishing and quantifying the effects of different hydrodynamic indicators and determining the leading factors should be the focus of future research 2 2 indirect effects of hydrodynamic conditions on algal blooms 2 2 1 water retention water retention also represented by water retention time residence time flushing time water age or water exchange is a prevalent and critical concept that primarily characterizes how long water or dissolved substances remain in a reservoir rueda et al 2006 fundamentally water retention is influenced by hydrodynamic conditions such as flow velocity and flow field thus water retention is a representative of the indirect hydrodynamic conditions in reservoirs previous studies have reached a consensus that water retention plays a vital role in algal biomass levels and accumulation and enhanced water retention is considered favorable for bloom development fig 3 burford et al 2007 gao et al 2018a soares et al 2008 song et al 2023b reducing water retention time and enhancing water exchange via reservoir operations can inhibit algal blooms cheng et al 2019 chuo et al 2019 however since water retention is affected by the defined boundaries and varies tremendously in different study sites it is not recommended as a universal approach for algal bloom control in reservoirs 2 2 2 stratification to date thermal stratification and its positive effects on phytoplankton growth have received the most attention in reservoirs fig 1c he et al 2019 li et al 2015 rigosi and rueda 2012 xu et al 2021a the stratification caused by dam construction and surface water heating indicates that the water column is relatively stable in the vertical direction fig 2 thus stratified water columns can weaken vertical mixing and hinder material exchange which essentially helps algae especially cyanobacteria migrate to the upper warmer waters to absorb light and proliferate fig 3 amorim and moura 2021 raine et al 2018 song et al 2021b for example stratified flow affected algal transport and might be a crucial driver in algal blooms in a tributary bay of the tgr li et al 2021b wind induced langmuir circulation may change surface mixing and hence affect the vertical distribution and aggregation of algae buranathanitt et al 1982 however there is relatively limited research on this topic additionally stratification is often accompanied by long water residence times and low flow velocities which collectively promote algal blooms this implies that different hydrodynamic effects can be synergistic azadi et al 2021 soares et al 2008 by linking thermal stratification and primary productivity in water columns critical depth theory hypothesizes that algal blooms occur when the surface mixed layer is shallower than a critical depth which defines the point at which algal growth exceeds losses sathyendranath et al 2015 sverdrup 1953 van ruth et al 2010 in terms of the mechanism of algal blooms the classical critical depth theory is widely used and has had a long lasting influence obata et al 1996 yang et al 2022 previous studies have reported that enhancing vertical mixing to disrupt stratification also called destratification can carry algae to deep and cold waters thus discouraging bloom development in reservoirs huang et al 2019 song et al 2021b 2 2 3 nutrient distribution nutrients including nitrogen phosphorous silica etc are essential environmental factors for algal blooms and have consistently attracted substantial research interest in terms of algal blooms in reservoirs it can be concluded that hydrodynamic conditions mainly alter nutrient transport and release thus regulating the nutrient distribution and availability for algal cells fig 2 and fig 3 ishikawa et al 2022 li et al 2018 yang et al 2018 for instance previous research has revealed that enhancing nutrient transport from the xiangxi bay tributary to the tgr mainstream could alleviate spring algal blooms in the tributary lang et al 2019 most recently researchers reported that algal growth in the near dam region of a brazilian reservoir was dominated by nutrient release from sediments especially when water levels were low and strong water turbulence existed near the sediment bed ishikawa et al 2022 in addition they found that the inflow nutrients were mainly consumed in the upstream region of the reservoir and did not pollute water quality downstream and in the tributaries these physical processes differ from a previous study that nutrients in the mainstream of the tgr could be carried into xiangxi bay through density currents yang et al 2018 thus different reservoirs may have distinct flow patterns and nutrient cycling processes and a case by case analysis is necessary to determine the nutrient driven mechanisms of algal bloom formations 2 2 4 light distribution another crucial driver in the formation of algal blooms in reservoirs is light distribution because irradiance is essential to phytoplankton photosynthesis fig 2 previous studies have shown that hydrodynamic mixing can facilitate algal cells exposed to light intermittently and promote algal growth fig 3 hadiyanto et al 2013 sarat chandra et al 2017 zhu et al 2019a nevertheless little attention has been given to the effects of flow conditions such as sedimentation and resuspension on underwater light distribution moreover compared with stratification and nutrients the role of light distribution on algal growth has largely been ignored in reservoirs this might be because solar radiation is a factor that cannot be controlled and is typically assumed to be suitable for algal growth when a bloom occurs in fact building a dam inevitably slows flow velocity increases water depth and leads to suspended matter sedimentation in the near dam region which collectively increase transparency and enhance underwater light intensity li et al 2018 subsequently a favorable light distribution exists in the near dam region and this can effectively promote algae to utilize light potentially serving as a precondition for algal blooms song et al 2021b in light of these circumstances researchers should further explore how hydrodynamic conditions influence light distribution attenuation and consequently affect algal growth in reservoirs 3 application of reservoir operation strategies for algal bloom control clarifying the mechanisms by which hydrodynamic conditions affect algal growth provides a crucial theoretical basis for creating an unfavorable hydrodynamic environment for algal blooms through reservoir operation strategies the relevant literature on algal bloom control using reservoir operation strategies was reviewed in the scopus database in january 2023 table s2 and fig 4 the results demonstrated that not much attention was given to the topic since the total number of publications was relatively small fig 4a china and the united states were the top countries in the number of publications on the topic fig 4b to systematically summarize the research status and provide explicit directions for future research the literature was classified into three categories basic reservoir operations selective withdrawal operations and multi objective optimal operations table 1 although each research category has a specific emphasis the three research categories are complementary table 1 the detailed descriptions are as follows 3 1 basic reservoir operations the first defined category is basic regular reservoir operations which focuses on regulating water release at a common fixed outflow height to adjust the hydrodynamic conditions to be unsuitable for algal growth studies of this category typically reveal the effects of reservoir operation processes on algal blooms for example previous studies reported that maintaining low water levels during the period when algal blooms tend to occur could control algal blooms in the burrinjuck reservoir and zipingpu reservoir table 1 lawrence et al 2000 song et al 2023b regardless of the water level variation types such as tide type and stair type fluctuations the intrinsic principle for controlling algal bloom is to disturb stratification reduce nutrients and enhance flow velocity and water exchange through reservoir operation strategies table 1 sha et al 2015 song et al 2021b yang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 the key reference indexes and their thresholds for controlling algal blooms are less studied which impedes the practical application of reservoir operation strategies although some researchers have proposed that the ratio of mixing layer depth and euphotic layer depth and the depth averaged velocity could be potential reference indexes in the tgr and the zipingpu reservoir ji et al 2017 song et al 2023b yang et al 2022 yang et al 2018 practical engineering verification and generalizations have not been reported to date the time scale for the application of reservoir operation strategies for bloom mitigation has primarily been long term spanning months chuo et al 2019 ji et al 2017 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2013 in addition most studies have focused on controlling algal blooms in the tributaries of the tgr table 1 these phenomena indicate that efficient and short term emergency reservoir operations for algal bloom control are still unavailable notably global warming and eutrophication can induce more widespread and frequent blooms glibert 2020 song et al 2021a thus the focus of future studies may need to shift to mitigating algal blooms on a large spatial scale such as blooms in both the mainstream and the tributaries of the zipingpu reservoir and the sanbanxi reservoir he et al 2019 song et al 2021b 3 2 selective withdrawal operation some reservoirs have multilevel intake facilities which provide opportunities to carry out selective withdrawal operations to restore water quality and mitigate algal blooms on the one hand researchers initially proposed hypolimnetic withdrawal instead of epilimnetic outflow to remove nutrients particularly phosphorous from the hypolimnion to downstream in north american and european lakes herman et al 2017 nürnberg 1987 nürnberg 2007 on the other hand some studies have also argued that surface or upper or metalimnetic withdrawal could flush away algae and reduce upward hypolimnetic phosphorus dispersion table 1 barbiero et al 1997 mi et al 2022 zouabi aloui et al 2015 song et al 2023a thus performing selective withdrawal to prevent algal blooms requires careful analysis of local conditions for example hypolimnetic withdrawal may not apply to a reservoir that does not form stable stratification or a nutrient enriched deep water layer nürnberg 2020 it is also worth noting that hypolimnetic withdrawal may not be an effective method for controlling algal species such as microcystis which thrive with higher n p ratios and require a more integrated and efficient approach lehman et al 2009 regarding the mechanisms of action the author believes deep withdrawal can remove the internal nutrient load thereby serving as a long term prevention measure while shallow withdrawal may serve as a promising emergency measure for controlling algal blooms since selective withdrawal operations introduce outlet locations as an extra variable to basic reservoir operations it is necessary to simultaneously consider the impacts of outflow discharge and elevation on algal blooms in addition due to rapid improvements in computing power coupling selective withdrawal operations with optimization algorithms to obtain the optimal withdrawal depth or strategy for improving water quality has gained increasing attention haghighat et al 2021 saadatpour et al 2021 3 3 multi objective optimal operations in addition to algal bloom control realistic reservoir operations should also take regular benefits such as flood prevention power generation and navigation into account balancing and optimizing the different benefits of reservoir operations is a difficult challenge to address this problem and promote the application of algal bloom control through reservoir operations researchers have proposed multi objective optimal operations and these have shown excellent potential in reservoirs table 1 specifically most studies have revealed distinct tradeoffs between algal bloom control and hydropower generation in reservoirs he et al 2022 hu et al 2014 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021b this occurs because dramatic fluctuations in water levels especially rapid declines could increase water exchange weaken stratification and inhibit algal blooms while decreasing hydropower generation he et al 2020 lian et al 2014 wang et al 2020 while some researchers have reported that conducting ecological operations may slightly improve flood control and shipping benefits the study area was limited to the tgr and the transferability of the findings is unclear hu et al 2016 hu et al 2014 previous studies typically used the statistical relationships between water quality and reservoir operation information to preliminarily assess algal bloom risks which was primarily data driven and computationally efficient hu et al 2014 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021b however this method does not provide dynamic and physical insights into the algal bloom formation process and lacks the theoretical justifications for performing various reservoir operation strategies which severely hampers practical applications due to rapid advances in computing power coupling a process based physics model and an optimization algorithm is conducive to resolving multi objective optimization problems and revealing the internal mechanism of algal bloom control in reservoirs haghighat et al 2021 he et al 2022 tarabih et al 2023 4 challenges and opportunities 4 1 hydrodynamic impacts on algal blooms the current research on hydrodynamic impacts on algal blooms is relatively limited compared with other essential factors such as nutrients temperature and light there is a widespread belief that strong hydrodynamic effects inhibit algal growth but the mechanisms by which hydrodynamic conditions affect algal growth are complex and not fully understood huang et al 2022 sha et al 2015 song et al 2021b regarding the direct effects of hydrodynamic conditions it is necessary to differentiate and quantify the effects of flow velocity water turbulence and shear stress on algal growth through systematic experiments and sophisticated numerical simulations table 2 by proceeding in this way the leading factor and governing mechanism for algal bloom control could be identified and the following questions could be answered which hydrodynamic indicator is most sensitive to algal cells is preventing colony formation through strong turbulence more effective than disturbing the antioxidation system by considerable shear stress for inhibiting algal blooms notably the availability of abundant amounts of nutrients could offset the inhibitory effect of strong water turbulence indicating that the influencing mechanisms of hydrodynamic conditions are exceptionally complex cui et al 2022 therefore in future research the coupled impacts of hydrodynamic conditions nutrients light and temperature should be examined to accurately explain the algal bloom process compared with the direct effects the indirect impacts of hydrodynamic conditions on algal growth are more significant and well studied especially in reservoirs from previous research it was principally concluded that 1 a short water residence time causes inhibitory effects on algal blooms 2 weakening stratification negatively affects algal growth however the effects of hydrodynamic conditions on nutrient and light distributions are seldom investigated in reservoirs table 2 this might be because different reservoirs have distinct hydrological and topographic conditions which lead to different nutrient cycling patterns that are complex and hard to observe and simulate ishikawa et al 2022 li et al 2018 therefore high frequency in situ monitoring and state of the art simulations of water quality and flow fields are greatly needed to determine nutrient transport and release and the subsequent effects on algal growth in reservoirs moreover algal blooms are consistently detected at the water surface where light conditions are favorable the effects of hydrodynamic conditions on underwater algal growth and light distribution are typically ignored the euphotic zone depth is critical for algal growth and its relationship with the mixing layer depth can to some extent dominate bloom outbreaks song et al 2021b yang et al 2022 thus applying critical depth theory to analyze algal bloom formation and control might be a research trend in reservoirs 4 2 using reservoir operation strategies to control algal blooms although some progress has been made in using reservoir operation strategies to control algal blooms such as weakening stratification and enhancing water exchange the key reference indexes for reservoir operation practices remain unclear table 2 this can be attributed to the fact that related research is limited and insufficient and engineering applications are severely lacking moreover the current reservoir operation strategies are mostly long term and focus on mitigating algal blooms in the tributaries of the tgr table 1 thus it is necessary to conduct extensive research to determine the key reference indexes and develop short term emergency reservoir operation strategies to guide practical application song et al 2023b selective withdrawal has shown the potential ability to alleviate eutrophication and control algal blooms in reservoirs however determining a feasible withdrawal elevation such as deep withdrawal or shallow withdrawal can be a challenge for reservoir managers table 2 for example reservoirs that do not exhibit stable stratification may not be suitable for nutrient removal through deep withdrawal nürnberg 2020 thus the effects of selective withdrawal on algal blooms and the key inhibitory effects still need to be further investigated on the other hand both the outflow rate and elevation should be considered during selective withdrawal and this requires optimization algorithms to determine the optimal withdrawal strategies for algal bloom control in reservoirs the tradeoffs between algal bloom control and hydropower generation in reservoirs are widely recognized thus optimization models have been proposed to resolve tradeoffs among the different reservoir benefits nonetheless the relationships between algal bloom control and regular reservoir benefits such as water supply and navigation are less studied table 2 furthermore in previous studies researchers have mainly focused on evaluating the results of the multi objective optimization model to alleviate eutrophication xu et al 2021b yosefipoor et al 2022 the underlying physical processes and internal mechanisms have not been fully explored coupling a physics model and an optimization model with highly efficient parallel computing may be a promising solution for the future table 2 5 conclusions although the research on the hydrodynamic mechanisms on algal blooms is advancing the main achievements and bottlenecks have not been recognized this study classifies the hydrodynamic influences as direct and indirect effects to systematically evaluate the research progress and gaps through literature investigation it was primarily concluded that enhancing direct hydrodynamic effects including flow velocity water turbulence and shear stress is unfavorable for algal blooms in reservoirs but enhancing indirect hydrodynamic effects including water retention stratification nutrient distribution and light distribution has the opposite effect even so substantial challenges exist in determining the leading hydrodynamic factors and governing mechanisms for algal bloom control the fundamental research on the coupled effects of hydrodynamic conditions and other essential environmental factors is still in its infancy moreover the effects of nutrient cycling and light distribution on algal blooms in reservoirs are incredibly complex and have not received sufficient attention the use of reservoir operation strategies to mitigate algal blooms has not been fully investigated probably due to the complex and unclear mechanisms governing algal blooms in reservoirs to conduct a systematic review the author categorized the research status into three main areas basic reservoir operations selective withdrawal operations and multi objective optimal operations the theoretical basis for implementing reservoir operations for bloom control is to create an unfavorable hydrodynamic environment selective withdrawal has the potential to control algal blooms in both long term and short term ways emerging multi objective optimal operations can significantly promote the practical application of reservoir operation strategies however more information is needed on the following topics the key reference indexes the emergency reservoir operations the optimal withdrawal elevation the relationships between algal bloom control and regular reservoir benefits and the ecological processes and physical mechanisms under the optimal reservoir operation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment yang song acknowledges the editors and

1998,in the context of global warming precipitation information over the tibetan plateau tp known as the water tower of asia is crucial for both atmospheric and hydrological cycle research as important alternatives of gauge observations the satellite based precipitation estimations and atmospheric reanalysis precipitation prodcuts have undergone rapid development over the past few decades however their performance and usabilities are not effectively investigated over the tp particularly for the latestly released products hence this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of a state of the art reanalysis precipitation era5 land and compares it with two imerg products i e imerg e and imerg l from 2001 to 2018 with a special focus on their hydrological utility results indicate that era5 land presents a severe overestimation of precipitation amount and precipitation frequency but well reflects their spatial temporal patterns over the entire tp the imerg products particularly for imerg f outperform era5 land in estimating precipitation amount in terms of hydrological utility in the upper yellow river basin both era5 land and imerg e show poor simulation performance using gauge based model parameters which is closely related to their overestimation underestimation of precipitation amount in contrast imerg f forced simulation performs much better due to its low systematic error when the hydrological model is recalibrated based on individual precipitation input the simulation performance of era5 land is comparable to imerg f slightly inferior to gauge observation therefore it is recommended that the selection of appropriate precipitation products need to accord their own research purposes imerg f provides a more accurate estimation of precipitation amount while employing input specific calibrated model parameters era5 land can provide long term hydrological simulations keywords imerg era5 land hydrological simulation error propagation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp is the highest plateau in the world and commonly known as the third pole qiu 2008 as such it exerts a large influence on regional monsoon and general global circulation via thermal forcing mechanisms wu et al 2015 moreover as the water tower of asia multiple asian river systems originate from the tp including the indus ganges brahmaputra yangtze and yellow rivers these rivers support more than 1 4 billion people downstream immerzeel walter et al 2010 however over the recent decades the tp has been experiencing significant climate changes kang et al 2010 kuang and jiao 2016 which changed the atmospheric and hydrological cycles and thus affected the water supply and food security downstream yao et al 2019 zheng et al 2018 for instance an overall surface warming and moistening yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2021b solar dimming yang et al 2014 permafrost degradation yang et al 2010 and glacier retreat yao et al 2012 zhou et al 2021 more delusively contrasting trends have been reflected in river discharge and lake levels whereby lakes expanded and runoff increased strongly in the dry central parts but decreased in wet eastern and southern parts wang et al 2017 these complex changes in turn drive the unremitting efforts to better understand the climate change impacts over the tp precipitation linking atmospheric and land surface processes plays a dominant role in weather and climate trenberth et al 2003 and is one of the most dominant forcing inputs for earth system models kucera et al 2013 which is crucial to understand the mechanisms of climate change therefore it is critically important to obtain spatially distributed quantitative precipitation estimations traditionally precipitation is measured by ground based rain gauges providing temporally continuous measurements with high temporal frequency although a single rain gauge only provides point scale observations the spatial knowledge of precipitation can theoretically be well captured if the gauge networks are dense enough zhang et al 2021a unfortunately in real cases the rain gauge networks are often limited by low spatial densities or unevenly distributed particularly in remote areas like the tp as a result ground based rain gauge observations are often not representative of larger areas over these regions such a problem is exacerbated over complex mountainous regions because of the much greater spatial variability ouyang et al 2021 and orographic precipitation roe 2004 this indicates that traditional ground based precipitation measurements are not enough in the tp due to its particular combination of high elevation complex terrain severe weather and inaccessibility especially for the western part of the plateau tang et al 2016 thus our understanding of spatiotemporal patterns and or variations of precipitation over the tp is inadequate therefore spatially distributed or grid based precipitation products are urgently needed in the tp satellite based precipitation estimations spes with various temporal and spatial resolutions have achieved inspiring improvement by combining many international satellite platforms during the past few decades kidd et al 2021 and become important alternative resources for acquiring regional or national scale precipitation information particularly for regions lacking gauge observations currently several well known quasi global spes are publicly available such as precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann hsu et al 1997 the climate precipitation center morphing method cmorph joyce et al 2004 and tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa products huffman et al 2007 promotion and application of them have brought considerable science and society benefits skofronick jackson et al 2017b with the implementation of the global precipitation measurement gpm mission a series of new generation of spes have been released typically the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg at relatively fine spatiotemporal resolution 0 1 and 0 5 h have been commended to use for various purposes sun et al 2018 the assessments and comparisons generally reported that imerg could reasonably capture the spatial temporal variability of precipitation and outperform its predecessor chen et al 2021 su et al 2019 wang et al 2018 even so as an indirect estimator of precipitation imerg products are still far from perfect particularly in areas with complex topography like the tp for instance ma et al 2019 found imerg final run product still exhibits deficiencies in identifying light and moderate snow although it has a considerable ability to detect liquid precipitation meanwhile xu et al 2017 pointed out that the accuracy of imerg in the tp is closely correlated with altitude and rainfall intensity all these evaluations infer that the imerg products should be used with caution in hydrological simulation over the tp however since a good simulation is the result of a good combination between precipitation input and a hydrological model the usability of imerg still needs to be further investigated camici et al 2020 atmospheric reanalysis products are another important alternative of gauge observations that have attracted increasing research interest in the recent decade xu et al 2022 normally reanalysis products combine a wide array of measured and remotely sensed information within a dynamical physical coupled numerical weather model based on the data assimilation in the past few decades diverse reanalysis products have been released to the public such as climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis interim era interim dee et al 2011 and japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 the continuous improvement of data assimilation techniques and weather models also promotes the upgrading of reanalysis products the fifth generation of european reanalysis era5 recently released by the european center for medium term weather forecasting ecmwf in 2019 is one of the state of the art reanalysis products supported by a better 4d var data assimilation scheme era5 provides more accurate hourly precipitation estimates at a horizontal resolution of 31 km hersbach et al 2020 with special focus on the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land an enhanced global dataset for the land component hereafter referred to as era5 land was released by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the era5 climate reanalysis muñoz sabater et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 found that the era5 greatly overestimates both the precipitation amount and occurrence frequency but successfully reproduces the interannual and decadal variabilities as well as the spatial temporal patterns of precipitation over the tp hence they recommended the potential capability of using the era5 to quantify climate and hydrological change over the tp meanwhile results in sun et al 2021 demonstrated that the era5 generally overestimates the discharge simulations based on the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model in high mountain asia basins covering the tp however the model parameters in sun et al 2021 were calibrated by gauge observations that may not be optimal for the era5 in addition xu et al 2022 showed that the downscaling processing could reduce the overestimation of era5 and thus improves their statistical performance nonetheless the recently released era5 land precipitation product has not been evaluated on the tp moreover since the era5 land is available at a high spatial temporal resolution 0 1 and hourly and has a long record 1950 to present which could provide added value in the description of the hydrological cycle however the hydrologic utility of the era5 land on the tp is still unclear therefore the objectives of this study are twofold 1 statistically assess the quality of the latest era5 land on the tp and compare it with the imerg products 2 investigate the hydrological utility of both era5 land and the imerg products in the upper yellow river basin uyrb the study area and data sets are briefly described in section 2 section 3 presents the methodology used in this research the results and discussion are arranged in sections 4 and 5 respectively and the conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the tp is bordered on the south by myanmar bhutan and nepal and by india and pakistan to the west since all available precipitation gauge stations are located in china according to the latest research of zhang et al 2021c this study area is limited to the plateau within china between 74 105 e and 25 40 n covering the entire xizang tibet and qinghai southern xinjiang and gansu western sichuan and northern yunnan provinces fig 1 a the mean elevation of the plateau is more than 4000 m above sea level with the kunlun mountains in the north the tangula mountains in the centrum the hengduan mountains in the east the gangdise mountains stretching from the west across the central plateau toward the southeast and the himalayas along the southern border of the plateau fig 1b the tp is renowned for its high altitude and numerous high mountain chains while the qaidam basin located in the northeastern part of the plateau has a relatively low average elevation of 2800 m in general the elevation of the tp gradually decreases from northwest to southeast the tp has a typical plateau climate characterized by wet and warm summers and cool and dry winters the average annual temperature of tp is 5 75 2 57 c with strongly seasonal and spatial heterogeneities he et al 2021 for example the monthly mean temperature in winter ranges from around 25 c in the west to 15 c in the east while in summer the monthly mean temperature warms to 0 5 c in the east and 5 10 c in the west cui and graf 2009 precipitation accumulation patterns in the tp are also highly variable in both time and space annual precipitation of tp ranges from approximately 1500 mm in the southeast to less than 100 mm in the northwest and more than 60 of total annual precipitation occurs in the summertime zhang et al 2013 in the context of global warming the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events have increased significantly wu et al 2013 highlighting the importance of precipitation investigations in the tp to explore the hydrological utility of both era5 land the imerg precipitation products over the tp as shown in fig 1b the upper yellow river basin uyrb which is above tangnaihai hydrological station is chosen as a typical demonstration basin the uyrb is located between 32 1 36 0 n and 95 8 103 5 e covering a drainage area of approximately 122 103 km2 su et al 2017 although the uyrb only accounts for 16 2 of the whole yellow river basin it provides more than 35 discharge of the yellow river basin serving as one of most important contributing sub basins su et al 2017 besides the uyrb is situated in a semiarid climate region characterized by the typical plateau climate system meanwhile the uyrb has a low population density and neither large reservoirs nor large irrigation projects exist in this area therefore the uyrb is a good testbed for assessing the potential hydrological utility of considered precipitation products over the tp 2 2 datasets three types of precipitation data are employed in this study the benchmark precipitation observed by weather stations the era5 land reanalysis data and the imerg spe in addition for the hydrological modeling some additional model inputs e g temperature and validation datasets e g discharge are also employed in this study 2 2 1 gauge precipitation observations gauge observations are usually employed as the basic benchmark to assess the performance of multi source precipitation products in this study the daily precipitation observations from the chinese national ground weather network which includes 2 426 weather stations are employed as the benchmark precipitation all these gauge observations are subjected to rigorous quality control including the expected maximum check the temporal consistency check and the spatial consistency check li et al 2021a however limited by the high altitude complex terrain and inaccessibility only 112 of the 2426 weather stations are located within the tp the spatial distribution of these weather stations is shown in fig 1b it is clear that the weather stations within the tp are distributed unevenly with relatively dense stations in eastern parts and sparse stations in central and western parts however in comparison to existing studies over the tp e g yuan et al 2021 and he et al 2021 relatively more stations are employed in this study therefore we believe that the observations from these weather stations can act as a receivable benchmark in evaluating and comparing the considered precipitation products in addition to facilitate distributed streamflow simulations the 23 gauge observations see fig 1b surrounding the uyrb are selected and interpolated into 0 1 0 1 grids matching the spatial resolution of both hydrological model and precipitation products by the inverse distance weighting method 2 2 2 era5 land reanalysis precipitation framed within the copernicus climate change service c3s the era5 is produced by the ecmwf benefiting from a decade of developments in model physics core dynamics and data assimilation compared to its predecessor the spatiotemporal resolution and accuracy of the era5 have been greatly improved hersbach et al 2020 the era5 land is an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the era5 in terms of precipitation estimations in the era5 land they are interpolated from the era5 through a linear interpolation method based on a triangular mesh in this way the spatial resolution of precipitation in the era5 land is downscaled to about 9 km from about 31 km in the era5 whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in the era5 muñoz sabater et al 2021 besides unlike previous land reanalysis traditional gauge corrections to the precipitation are not included in the era5 land to enhance the quality of the era5 precipitation this greatly reduces the dependencies of era5 land on external data and makes it possible to obtain near real time data theoretically since the era5 land enables the temporal consistent estimation of precipitation coupled with its long record which shows the high potential capability to support studies of climate and hydrological changes hence the era5 land precipitation is employed in this study since daily scale of the era5 land product is not available it is aggregated from hourly products following cao et al 2019 2 2 3 imerg satellite based precipitation estimations the satellite based precipitation estimations used in this study are the two imerg products building upon the success of the trmm the gpm mission is designed to provide the next generation global observations of rain and snow and thus help to advance our understanding of earth s water and energy budgets designed specifically for the gpm mission the imerg algorithm potentially provides the best precipitation estimations by intercalibrating merging and interpolating all satellite mw based precipitation estimates together with microwave calibrated infrared based precipitation estimations precipitation gauge analyses and potentially other precipitation estimators at fine spatiotemporal scales 0 1 0 1 0 5 h to accommodate the different user requirements the imerg algorithm is run three times for each observation time first giving a quick estimate i e early run imerg e and successively providing a better estimate i e late run imerg l as more data arrive since the monthly gauge data is available the final run of imerg algorithm is to create a research level product i e final run imerg f hence imerg e and imerg l are near real time products that are available about 4 h and 12 h after observation time respectively while imerg f is a post real time product that is released approximately two months after the observation month for a more detailed description of imerg products please refer to huffman et al 2019 combining timeliness and accuracy imerg e and imerg f are assessed and compared in this study to match the records of gauge observations daily imerg products are aggregated from corresponding 0 5 hourly products following su et al 2021 2 2 4 model forcing and validation datasets in this study the grid based xinanjiang model is applied to the uyrb to investigate the hydrological utility of three considered precipitation products over the tp three types of precipitation datasets namely the interpolated gauge observation daily aggregated era5 land and two daily imerg products i e imerg e and imerg f are used as model inputs to perform historical daily streamflow simulations respectively the near surface daily minimum and maximum temperatures required by the grid based xinanjiang model are also obtained from the above mentioned weather stations and re gridded into the regular 0 1 grids note that as suggested by yuan et al 2018 the near surface air temperature is assumed to decrease by 0 65 c per altitude increase of 100 m the daily discharge observations of uyrb are collected from the tangnaihai hydrological station see fig 1b which are available from the china annual hydrological report published by the ministry of water resources limited by availability of these datasets the entire study period is from 2001 to 2018 in which 2001 2010 and 2011 2018 are selected as calibration and validation periods of hydrological modeling respectively 3 methodology 3 1 comparison and evaluation procedures of precipitation products in this study the assessment of three considered precipitation products is based on a pairwise approach i e the point to grid matching method following freitas et al 2020 when there is only one gauge in the native grid of precipitation products the gauge observations are directly matched with grid precipitation if more than one gauge is found in the grid their average values are compared with grid precipitation grids without any gauge are excluded from the analyses to quantify the accuracy of three considered precipitation products the correlation coefficient cc relative bias rbias and normalized root mean square error nrmse are utilized in this study in which cc provides a measure of the linear correlation rbias reflects the system bias i e greater than 0 rbias means the selected precipitation product overestimates the precipitation and vice versa and nrmse shows the average magnitude of error as a rule the higher cc and lower absolute rbias together with lower nrmse signify better performance of the evaluated precipitation products meanwhile the categorical statistical indices i e the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi are also employed to describe the detection performance of the selected precipitation products pod gives the fraction of actual precipitation events correctly detected by the precipitation products while far calculates the fraction of precipitation evens that the precipitation products incorrectly identify csi is an integrated statistic metric that balances pod and far providing an overall detection performance of the selected precipitation products note that according to tian et al 2009 and yong et al 2016 a small value i e 1 mm day is used as the rain no rain threshold to calculate the categorical metrics formulas and perfect values of the above mentioned statistical metrics are listed in table 1 3 2 grid based xinanjiang model and hydrological simulation scenarios the xinanjiang model is a famous conceptual rainfall runoff hydrological model building upon the saturation excess runoff mechanism since it was first proposed by zhao 1992 the xinanjiang model has been widely applied to humid and semi humid catchments of china and has become an operational hydrological model yuan et al 2018 to enhance its applicability a grid based xinanjiang model was developed for user demand li et al 2007 the three soil layer evapotranspiration and saturation excess runoff schemes used in lumped version are inherited by the grid based xinanjiang model to simulate actual evapotranspiration and total runoff in each running grid yuan and ren 2004 meanwhile the total runoff in each grid is divided into three runoff types i e surface interflow and groundwater runoffs by a gravitational water reservoir with bottom and side outlets to represent the hillslope runoff processes then three linear reservoirs are adopted to perform the slope runoff convergence respectively finally the simulated discharge at the outlet of the given catchment is obtained by the muskingum routing method yuan et al 2005 the grid based xinanjiang model is forced by gridded precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in this study the interpolated gauge observations and three considered precipitation products are used as the precipitation inputs severally while the potential evapotranspiration is calculated by daily minimum and maximum near surface temperature via the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1982 the grid based xinanjiang model contains 15 parameters of which 8 parameters are used for actual evapotranspiration and runoff and 7 parameters for hillslope runoff concentration and streamflow routing in this study the shuffled complex evolution global optimization algorithm sce ua developed by duan et al 1994 is adopted to automatically calibrate the model since the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse tends to provide high importance to high flows the maximum sum of nse and its log transformation lognse is used as the objective function to search the optimized model parameters that can accurately capture both high and low flow processes the objective function is defined as 1 f m a x n s e l o g n s e n s e 1 ii 1 n q s i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 l o g n s e 1 i 1 n l o g q s i l o g q o i 2 i 1 n l o g q o i log q o 2 where n represents the sample number q o i and q s i are observed and simulated discharge m 3 s respectively q o and log q o are mean values of corresponding elements in this study two model calibration scenarios are designed to better investigate the hydrological utility of the considered precipitation products scenario i the parameters of the grid based xinanjiang model are calibrated and validated using interpolated gauge observations as the precipitation inputs and then forced by three considered precipitation products respectively without changing model parameters keeping model parameters is beneficial to analyze the effect of precipitation errors on simulation results as well as to analyze the toleration of grid based xinanjiang model to the precipitation error scenario ii the parameters of the grid based xinanjiang model are calibrated and validated using considered precipitation products as the precipitation input respectively the precipitation input specific calibration procedure in this scenario is an important option for hydrological applications of considered precipitation products in ungauged basins without precipitation observations 4 results 4 1 overall comparison of precipitation characteristics in this section we focus on directly comparing the three considered precipitation products against the gauge observations during the entire study period from 2001 to 2018 as shown in fig 2 the gauge observed monthly precipitation illustrates an inverse v shaped trend with the peak that appeared in july as we know due to the uniquely high altitude the tp is characterized by an independent plateau monsoon system whereby the airflow at the lower level around the plateau leads to cyclonic atmospheric circulation in summer and is altered by anti cyclone in the winter maussion et al 2014 as a result most precipitation within the tp falls from may to september and reaches a maximum in july or august thereby giving the tp wet and warm summers and cool and dry winters the evidence from the gauge observed monthly precipitation variation perfectly supports the above mentioned temporal pattern the three considered precipitation products can generally capture the monthly variation tendency revealed by the gauge observations but in terms of precipitation amount there are significant differences the monthly average precipitation of the era5 land is near twice larger than the observed ones for almost all months especially in the cold season from november to the following march whereas the near real time imerg e tends to underestimate precipitation in contrast probably attributing to the monthly gauge calibration the imerg f well reproduces the observed monthly precipitation indicating best performance in estimating the precipitation amount in terms of the spatial distribution the daily average precipitation accumulation and associated seasonal ones derived from the gauge observations and the considered precipitation products are shown in fig 3 and fig s1 respectively as shown in fig 3a a strong spatial heterogeneity of daily average precipitation is observed in the gauge observations with daily precipitation gradually decreasing from southeast to northwest a similar spatial scenario also occurs in spring summer and autumn seasons whereas precipitation is low throughout the tp in winter see the first row of fig s1 such spatial pattern is mainly influenced by the joint effect of various dynamical climate systems specifically in summer the flow caused by the indian summer monsoon and the east asian summer monsoon brings abundant moisture from the arabian sea and the bay of bengal as well as the south china sea and the western pacific zhu et al 2011 this inevitably generates heavy precipitation in the southeast portions of tp in winter with the reduction of monsoon intensity the zonal orientation of the himalayas blocks the synoptic scale exchanges of warm tropical air with cold polar air centered near siberia with the single exception of cold air exchange along the eastern front of the himalayas rees and collins 2006 therefore the vast plateau region just acquires minimal levels of moisture produced by the westerly winds the spatial distribution patterns of gauge observations shown in fig s1 are consistent with our expectations based on knowledge of large scale seasonal patterns from atmospheric flows in the tp compared with the gauge observations pronounced differences can be found between era5 land and imerg products era5 land can coarsely capture the spatial variability of gauge observations in both annual and season scales which however tend to overestimate the precipitation amount such result is consistent with the evaluation results of era land in fig 2 besides visually the spatial patter of two imerg products is more consistent with gauge observations than era5 land while the average precipitation of imerg f is much closer to the observed ones than the imerg e fig 4 and fig s2 show the average precipitation frequency for the gauge observations and three considered precipitation products in annual and season scales respectively note that a small value of 1 mm day same as the threshold used in the calculation of categorical metrics is employed to determine the occurrence of precipitation events for calculating the precipitation frequency with an average value of 23 58 the precipitation frequency of gauge observations ranges from 1 88 to 49 02 following the spatial pattern of precipitation amount shown in fig 3a in other words regions with high precipitation amounts generally have a relatively high precipitation frequency besides like the seasonal differences in precipitation amount the precipitation frequency also exhibits significant seasonal variation the highest precipitation frequency occurs in summer average value of 47 02 followed by spring and autumn with an average value of 3 82 winter has the lowest precipitation frequency in contrast era5 land grossly overestimates the actual precipitation frequency in both annual fig 4b and seasonal fig s2 scales similar results can also be found in yuan et al 2021 which even suggested that the overestimation of era5 in precipitation amount is mainly caused by the overestimation of precipitation frequency as for the imerg products with slightly better performance of imerg f the occurrence frequency of daily precipitation is much closer to the gauge observations than that in era5 land since the gauge calibration in imerg f operated by monthly gpcc data does not change precipitation events xu et al 2016 the better performance of imerg f in precipitation frequency is mainly attributed to the employment of more additional microwave sensors and the bidirectional propagation algorithm of passive microwave only forward propagation of the microwave data used in imerg e su et al 2021 4 2 statistical performance of the three considered precipitation products to spatially analyze the temporal performance of three considered precipitation products the basic statistical indices i e cc rbias and nrmse are calculated and shown in fig 5 clearly imerg f shares a quite similar spatial pattern of cc metric with that of imerg e but imerg f has a significantly higher average cc value 0 64 vs 0 57 highlighting the improved linear consistency of imerg f with the gauge observations although the spatial average cc value of era5 land is between that of the two imerg products the spatial distribution of them shows a distinct difference for example the larger cc values of imerg products are mainly distributed in the southern parts of the tp while those of era5 land are primarily located on the east parts of the tp as for the rbias metric era5 land remarkably overestimates the precipitation amount with a spatial average rbias of 66 40 regions of high rbias in era5 land are mainly distributed in the southern parts of the tp where positive rbias is generally higher than 80 compared with cc metric shown in fig 5a we can even infer that the low cc values of era5 land over these regions are probably caused by the high overestimation with an average rbias values of 24 46 imerg e underestimates the precipitation amount over most of the tp but remarkably overestimates the precipitation amount on the northern edge of the qaidam basin see fig 1b rbias of imerg f is characterized by an alternate distribution of positive and negative values attributing to the mutual ablation of positive and negative values average rbias of imerg f is best of the three considered gpps however the clear overestimations in some regions like the northern edge of the qaidam basin and the southwestern border of the tp still cannot be ignored interestingly although era5 land has a remarkably higher rbias than imerg products the nrmse values of them are in the same order that share a similar spatial distribution as for the capacity of precipitation detection in terms of pod far and csi metrics shown in fig 6 era5 land demonstrates the highest pod values average value of 0 88 of the three considered precipitation products indicating the highest accuracy in detecting actual precipitation events however with a spatial average value of 0 50 it also has the highest far values this situation is closely related to the overestimated precipitation frequency in the era5 land product fig 4b vs fig 4a particularly for light rain in detail additional precipitation events reflected by high precipitation frequency in era5 land increase the probability of correct detection and synchronously increase the risk of misstatement hence the overall detection performance according to csi metric of era5 land is in the same order of magnitude as that of two imerg products as for the intercomparison of the two imerg products they share almost identical spatial distributions of pod and far metrics while imerg f has a clearly higher pod and a slightly higher far than imerg e therefore the csi metrics of imerg f are generally higher than that of imerg e indicting slight better performance in detecting precipitation occurrence due to the high probability of false precipitation events all three considered precipitation products show poor detection performance around the qaidam basin hence reducing the frequency of false precipitation alarms over these regions and thus improving the overall accuracy remains an important future task for both reanalysis and satellite based precipitation products developers previous investigations and studies have suggested that the performance of both reanalysis and satellite based precipitation products shows a strong seasonal variation chen et al 2020 guo et al 2021 tong et al 2014 to explore the performance stability of considered precipitation products over the tp the season statistical metrics of them are shown and compared in fig 7 with median values wavering around 0 6 cc metric of era5 land is relatively stable over the four seasons however rbias and nrmse of era5 land in winter are significantly higher than those in other three seasons from fig 7e the high probability of false precipitation events high far contributes most to the high rbias and nrmse of era5 land in winter of course the low precipitation amount see fig 2 which reduces the denominator of rbias and nrmse is also an important reason as for the imerg products the low cc and high nrmse values indicate that their performance in winter is also much poorer than in other three seasons pod and far based analyses show that the imerg products can hardly detect precipitation events accurately in winter this is mainly related to the fact that winter precipitation on the tp is dominated by snowfall generally solid precipitation estimations are 10 times more complex than liquid precipitation estimations and thus snowfall estimations from satellite sensors are usually unreliable skofronick jackson et al 2017a a similar situation was also reported by ma et al 2016 for the northeastern tp hence both era5 land and imerg products should be used with caution in winter 4 3 hydrological utility evaluation of the three considered precipitation products in the previous section the three considered precipitation products are systematically assessed and compared against gauge observations over the entire tp while their hydrological utility in basin scale is also a meaningful topic of heightened concern hence in this season the hydrological utilities of three considered precipitation products in daily streamflow simulation are evaluated using the grid based xinanjiang model over the uyrb fig 8 depicts the daily observed hydrograph and corresponding simulated hydrograph forced by interpolated gauge observations at the tangnaihai station the figure demonstrates that the simulated streamflow agrees well with the observations and can capture the key fluctuation trend of observed hydrograph in both calibration and verification periods with performance metrics of nse and lognse larger than 0 85 see table 2 the performance of the grid based xinanjiang model is very stable in the two periods hence the grid based xinanjiang model is suitable for hydrological simulation in the uyrb and can be used to evaluate the hydrological performance of considered precipitation products the gauge based calibrated grid based xinanjiang model is then forced by the three considered precipitation products to investigate their hydrological utilities in the uyrb directly the simulated daily discharges are shown in fig 9 against observed daily discharges the performance metrics computed between the simulated and observed hydrographs are also given in table 2 compared with the gauge forced simulation three precipitation products forced simulations all show remarkable performance degradation especially for the era5 land and imerg e products the era5 land forced simulation severely overestimates the actual streamflow whereas the imerg e based simulation significantly underestimates the actual streamflow the main reason can be related to their overestimation or underestimation of precipitation amount see section 4 2 besides the model parameters calibrated by interpolated observations are not optimal for them is also an important reason interestingly despite the undeniable over or under estimation the variation trend or seasonal fluctuation of both era5 land and imerg e driven simulations is very consistent with that of the observed hydrograph this may suggest that the era5 land and imerg e can reconstruct seasonal interannual and decadal variabilities of precipitation as for the imerg f intuitively the simulated discharges match well with the observed values highlighting the added value of monthly gauge calibration however with poor performance in the calibration period and better performance in the validation period 0 68 vs 0 72 for nse and 0 57 vs 0 75 for lognse respectively the simulation performance of imerg f is still not stable enough to investigate the hydrological utilities of three considered precipitation products in the ungauged basins the grid based xinanjiang model is recalibrated and validated using individual precipitation product as the input for the same study periods visual comparisons and associated diagnostic metrics of simulations are presented in fig 10 and table 3 respectively clearly the performance of precipitation input specific calibrated simulations in scenario ii is much better than that in scenario i using gauge calibrated model parameters as evidenced by higher nse and lognse in all the study periods this phenomenon indicates that the input specific calibration can effectively improve the hydrological utilities of the precipitation product which also confirms that the gauge calibrated model parameters cannot be directly transplanted to precipitation products forced simulations comparison between fig 9 and fig 10 shows that the model parameters recalibration can greatly suppress the systematic bias of precipitation input and thus enhance the tolerance of the hydrological model to the precipitation error comparatively the era5 land forced simulation demonstrates comparable performance to the imerg f but it is more likely to miss high flow peaks e g in 2011 2012 2013 and 2018 although the simulation performance has been improved significantly by recalibration of model parameters limited by inefficiencies in simulating high flows lower nse and higher lognse the imerg e forced simulation still performs worst among the three considered precipitation products in addition in the two model parameter calibration scenarios none of the three considered precipitation products perform better than the interpolated gauge observations indicating that both reanalysis and satellite based precipitation cannot replace gauge observations in providing the most accurate and stable discharge simulations 5 discussion 5 1 comparison between point to grid and grid to grid assessments of precipitation products in this study three precipitation products i e era5 land imerg e and imerg f are statistically assessed and compared over the tp and their hydrological utilities are investigated in the uyrb since the weather stations in the tp are not dense enough the statistical assessment is operated through the point to grid matching approach this means that the regional average precipitation on the grid greater than100 km 2 is directly compared to the observed values at a special point such spatial mismatching may bias the assessment results especially in regions with high spatial heterogeneity of precipitation assessing the grid based precipitation through grid to grid matching approach by using interpolated observations as the benchmark is another important alternative in grid precipitation evaluation grid to grid matching scheme can avoid spatial mismatching but the interpolation may introduce uncertainty into the interpolated benchmark and the sparser of observations the higher uncertainty of interpolated benchmark zhang et al 2020 fig 11 compares the performance of the three considered precipitation products using the two spatial matching approaches in the uyrb results indicate that the era5 land performs better in grid to grid matching approach than that in point to grid approach with higher cc average value of 0 69 vs 0 62 comparable rbias and lower nrmse average value of 1 76 vs 2 08 in contrast from point to grid matching to grid to grid matching the two imerg products both exhibit slight performance degradation evidenced by the reduced cc values this is mainly due to a fact that the interpolation can lead to false precipitation signals and a similar situation also occurs for downscaling in terms of categorical metrics the era land presents lower far and higher csi metrics in grid to grid matching approach than that in point to grid approach whereas the detection performance of imerg products is significantly reduced this confirms the above inference again tan 2019 suggested that the availability and distribution of the precipitation gauges are the most important considerations to decide which spatial matching approach to be adopted if a network including high density and well distributed precipitation gauges is available the grid to grid matching approach is more suitable otherwise interpolation of gauge observations may reduce the spatial variability of precipitation and further reduce the reliability of interpolated gauge reference in fact if gauge stations are not dense enough or unevenly distributed even using the point to grid matching approach the diagnostic information of considered precipitation products can also be missed in some regions for example due to lacking gauge observations the performance of three considered precipitation products over central and western parts of tp is still unclear in this study hence to obtain accurate precipitation knowledge of the tp a denser gauge network with good quality precipitation observations is urgently needed especially in the central and western parts of tp besides as suggested by li et al 2021b good data sharing and management is also particularly important for addressing today s data scarce challenge 5 2 error propagation from precipitation to simulated discharge with increasing temporal and spatial resolution globally available precipitation products have made their exploitation in hydrological applications possible especially in data scarce regions since all the precipitation products have their own strengths and limitations in accuracy and spatial temporal representativeness understanding how uncertainties transfer from input precipitation to simulated discharge through the hydrological model has been identified as one of the critical issues for simplify a linear relationship between precipitation error and hydrological simulation is often considered mei et al 2016 nanding et al 2021 in this assumption hydrologic models may amplify or dampen precipitation error through the complex runoff generation and confluence process nanding et al 2021 su et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 meanwhile a few other studies suggested that propagation of precipitation errors through hydrological modeling varies with seasons and is closely associated with the hydrological model formulation and the basin characteristics camici et al 2018 for instance nikolopoulos et al 2010 found that the error propagation from precipitation to simulated discharge depends on the basin size whereas no such signal was found in the study of falck et al 2015 hence although error propagation of precipitation in hydrological modeling has been investigated in various studies due to the strong nonlinearity in hydrological processes it still remains unclear and sometimes controversial in this section the interpolated observations and corresponding simulated discharge are employed as the benchmark to investigate precipitation error propagation through the grid based xinanjiang model in the uyrb from fig 8 and table 2 discharge simulation forced by the interpolated gauge observations exhibits excellent performance throughout the study period and can serve as the benchmark in the precipitation error propagation analysis since the categorical metrics provide limited information in the selection of precipitation products for hydrological modeling camici et al 2020 they are not considered in this section by comparing fig 9 and fig 10 with table 4 some insights have been noted that the cc metric is also not reliable in precipitation error propagation analysis for example in the basin average precipitation comparison the era5 land has a high cc value of 0 91 although the cc value of era5 land forced simulation is still as high as 0 93 its hydrological performance is really poor in scenario i fig 9a in contrast rbias along with nrmse seem to be more appropriate for analyzing precipitation error propagation through the hydrological model normally keeping hydrological model parameters i e scenario i in this study the precipitation products characterized by absolute rbias values close to 0 and low nrmse values allow for better simulation however in the uyrb the systematic errors in terms of rbias can be more than double from input precipitation to simulated discharge this finding is in line with maggioni et al 2013 however with respect to the nrmse no useful knowledge is found to characterize precipitation error propagation in scenario i some studies considered a nrmse value of lower than 0 5 in spite of lacking evidence to justify this value to be associated with good hydrological simulation satgé et al 2019 however none of the three considered precipitation products meets this requirement in the uyrb this may explain the non action of nrmse metric in precipitation error propagation in scenario i over the uyrb besides previous studies have demonstrated that the input specific recalibration of model parameters can reduce the influence of imperfect precipitation input and thus obtain good hydrological performances camici et al 2020 su et al 2021 in this case the improved discharge simulation performance in scenario ii comparing fig 10 with fig 9 confirms this finding from table 4 it is clear that the error in terms of rbias and nrmse decreases greatly from input precipitation to simulated discharge through the grid based xinanjiang model this means that the adjustment of model parameters can increase the tolerance of the hydrological model to input errors although rbias and nrmse are not the objective functions in the parametric calibration scheme however model parameters recalibrated by imperfect precipitation input e g spes or reanalysis data may not be sufficient to characterize the natural basin feature and thus result in lower predictive capability in internal sub basins su et al 2021 or other model outputs like evapotranspiration zhang et al 2020 hence more research studies focusing on error propagation should be recommended to form a general guideline about which performance metric s and associated range can be used to ensure good hydrological performances besides potential influence of hydrological model formulation and associated model parameters calibration scheme and basin characteristics also need to be clarified by future studies 6 conclusions reanalysis and satellite based precipitation products with high quality and fine spatial temporal resolutions have provided unprecedented opportunities for hydrological simulation but end users are still struggling with their unclear uncertainties especially for the latest released products this study assesses the performance of recently released era5 land products and compares it with two imerg products from 2001 to 2018 with a special focus on their hydrological modeling capability the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the era5 land well reproduces the intra annual variation and spatial temporal pattern of precipitation over the tp but it severely overestimates the precipitation amount and precipitation frequency while the imerg e underestimates them in contrast the imerg f performs best among the three considered precipitation products in estimating the precipitation amount 2 the era5 land has the highest pod and far values indicating that it performs best in detecting actual precipitation events but also contains many false precipitation events the imerg products have remarkably lower pod and far values but overall detection performance in terms of csi of them is in the same measure as the era5 land besides all three considered products should be used with caution in winter 3 the simulated discharge forced by the interpolated gauge observations agree well with the observed hydrographs highlighting the excellent performance of the grid based xinanjiang model in the uyrb keeping model parameters the era5 land and imerg e demonstrate poorly simulated performance due to their high systematic error while much better performance ns 0 7 and logns 0 65 is noted for the imerg f 4 employing input specific calibrated model parameters significantly improves the simulation performance of three systematic in this context the era5 land demonstrates comparable simulation performance to the imerg f but still worse than the interpolated gauge observation considering its long record the era5 land exhibits high added values in the reconstruction of historical discharge although the imerg e forced simulation still has some shortcomings in the uyrb it still shows good potential due to the short time lag in summary to reply to the above mentioned scientific question we recommend that the appropriate precipitation product should be selected according to their own research purposes for near real time applications the imerg e is a very valuable candidate if accurate precipitation is required the imerg f can be considered the era5 land can play an essential role in the

1998,in the context of global warming precipitation information over the tibetan plateau tp known as the water tower of asia is crucial for both atmospheric and hydrological cycle research as important alternatives of gauge observations the satellite based precipitation estimations and atmospheric reanalysis precipitation prodcuts have undergone rapid development over the past few decades however their performance and usabilities are not effectively investigated over the tp particularly for the latestly released products hence this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of a state of the art reanalysis precipitation era5 land and compares it with two imerg products i e imerg e and imerg l from 2001 to 2018 with a special focus on their hydrological utility results indicate that era5 land presents a severe overestimation of precipitation amount and precipitation frequency but well reflects their spatial temporal patterns over the entire tp the imerg products particularly for imerg f outperform era5 land in estimating precipitation amount in terms of hydrological utility in the upper yellow river basin both era5 land and imerg e show poor simulation performance using gauge based model parameters which is closely related to their overestimation underestimation of precipitation amount in contrast imerg f forced simulation performs much better due to its low systematic error when the hydrological model is recalibrated based on individual precipitation input the simulation performance of era5 land is comparable to imerg f slightly inferior to gauge observation therefore it is recommended that the selection of appropriate precipitation products need to accord their own research purposes imerg f provides a more accurate estimation of precipitation amount while employing input specific calibrated model parameters era5 land can provide long term hydrological simulations keywords imerg era5 land hydrological simulation error propagation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp is the highest plateau in the world and commonly known as the third pole qiu 2008 as such it exerts a large influence on regional monsoon and general global circulation via thermal forcing mechanisms wu et al 2015 moreover as the water tower of asia multiple asian river systems originate from the tp including the indus ganges brahmaputra yangtze and yellow rivers these rivers support more than 1 4 billion people downstream immerzeel walter et al 2010 however over the recent decades the tp has been experiencing significant climate changes kang et al 2010 kuang and jiao 2016 which changed the atmospheric and hydrological cycles and thus affected the water supply and food security downstream yao et al 2019 zheng et al 2018 for instance an overall surface warming and moistening yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2021b solar dimming yang et al 2014 permafrost degradation yang et al 2010 and glacier retreat yao et al 2012 zhou et al 2021 more delusively contrasting trends have been reflected in river discharge and lake levels whereby lakes expanded and runoff increased strongly in the dry central parts but decreased in wet eastern and southern parts wang et al 2017 these complex changes in turn drive the unremitting efforts to better understand the climate change impacts over the tp precipitation linking atmospheric and land surface processes plays a dominant role in weather and climate trenberth et al 2003 and is one of the most dominant forcing inputs for earth system models kucera et al 2013 which is crucial to understand the mechanisms of climate change therefore it is critically important to obtain spatially distributed quantitative precipitation estimations traditionally precipitation is measured by ground based rain gauges providing temporally continuous measurements with high temporal frequency although a single rain gauge only provides point scale observations the spatial knowledge of precipitation can theoretically be well captured if the gauge networks are dense enough zhang et al 2021a unfortunately in real cases the rain gauge networks are often limited by low spatial densities or unevenly distributed particularly in remote areas like the tp as a result ground based rain gauge observations are often not representative of larger areas over these regions such a problem is exacerbated over complex mountainous regions because of the much greater spatial variability ouyang et al 2021 and orographic precipitation roe 2004 this indicates that traditional ground based precipitation measurements are not enough in the tp due to its particular combination of high elevation complex terrain severe weather and inaccessibility especially for the western part of the plateau tang et al 2016 thus our understanding of spatiotemporal patterns and or variations of precipitation over the tp is inadequate therefore spatially distributed or grid based precipitation products are urgently needed in the tp satellite based precipitation estimations spes with various temporal and spatial resolutions have achieved inspiring improvement by combining many international satellite platforms during the past few decades kidd et al 2021 and become important alternative resources for acquiring regional or national scale precipitation information particularly for regions lacking gauge observations currently several well known quasi global spes are publicly available such as precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann hsu et al 1997 the climate precipitation center morphing method cmorph joyce et al 2004 and tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa products huffman et al 2007 promotion and application of them have brought considerable science and society benefits skofronick jackson et al 2017b with the implementation of the global precipitation measurement gpm mission a series of new generation of spes have been released typically the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg at relatively fine spatiotemporal resolution 0 1 and 0 5 h have been commended to use for various purposes sun et al 2018 the assessments and comparisons generally reported that imerg could reasonably capture the spatial temporal variability of precipitation and outperform its predecessor chen et al 2021 su et al 2019 wang et al 2018 even so as an indirect estimator of precipitation imerg products are still far from perfect particularly in areas with complex topography like the tp for instance ma et al 2019 found imerg final run product still exhibits deficiencies in identifying light and moderate snow although it has a considerable ability to detect liquid precipitation meanwhile xu et al 2017 pointed out that the accuracy of imerg in the tp is closely correlated with altitude and rainfall intensity all these evaluations infer that the imerg products should be used with caution in hydrological simulation over the tp however since a good simulation is the result of a good combination between precipitation input and a hydrological model the usability of imerg still needs to be further investigated camici et al 2020 atmospheric reanalysis products are another important alternative of gauge observations that have attracted increasing research interest in the recent decade xu et al 2022 normally reanalysis products combine a wide array of measured and remotely sensed information within a dynamical physical coupled numerical weather model based on the data assimilation in the past few decades diverse reanalysis products have been released to the public such as climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis interim era interim dee et al 2011 and japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 the continuous improvement of data assimilation techniques and weather models also promotes the upgrading of reanalysis products the fifth generation of european reanalysis era5 recently released by the european center for medium term weather forecasting ecmwf in 2019 is one of the state of the art reanalysis products supported by a better 4d var data assimilation scheme era5 provides more accurate hourly precipitation estimates at a horizontal resolution of 31 km hersbach et al 2020 with special focus on the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land an enhanced global dataset for the land component hereafter referred to as era5 land was released by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the era5 climate reanalysis muñoz sabater et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 found that the era5 greatly overestimates both the precipitation amount and occurrence frequency but successfully reproduces the interannual and decadal variabilities as well as the spatial temporal patterns of precipitation over the tp hence they recommended the potential capability of using the era5 to quantify climate and hydrological change over the tp meanwhile results in sun et al 2021 demonstrated that the era5 generally overestimates the discharge simulations based on the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model in high mountain asia basins covering the tp however the model parameters in sun et al 2021 were calibrated by gauge observations that may not be optimal for the era5 in addition xu et al 2022 showed that the downscaling processing could reduce the overestimation of era5 and thus improves their statistical performance nonetheless the recently released era5 land precipitation product has not been evaluated on the tp moreover since the era5 land is available at a high spatial temporal resolution 0 1 and hourly and has a long record 1950 to present which could provide added value in the description of the hydrological cycle however the hydrologic utility of the era5 land on the tp is still unclear therefore the objectives of this study are twofold 1 statistically assess the quality of the latest era5 land on the tp and compare it with the imerg products 2 investigate the hydrological utility of both era5 land and the imerg products in the upper yellow river basin uyrb the study area and data sets are briefly described in section 2 section 3 presents the methodology used in this research the results and discussion are arranged in sections 4 and 5 respectively and the conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the tp is bordered on the south by myanmar bhutan and nepal and by india and pakistan to the west since all available precipitation gauge stations are located in china according to the latest research of zhang et al 2021c this study area is limited to the plateau within china between 74 105 e and 25 40 n covering the entire xizang tibet and qinghai southern xinjiang and gansu western sichuan and northern yunnan provinces fig 1 a the mean elevation of the plateau is more than 4000 m above sea level with the kunlun mountains in the north the tangula mountains in the centrum the hengduan mountains in the east the gangdise mountains stretching from the west across the central plateau toward the southeast and the himalayas along the southern border of the plateau fig 1b the tp is renowned for its high altitude and numerous high mountain chains while the qaidam basin located in the northeastern part of the plateau has a relatively low average elevation of 2800 m in general the elevation of the tp gradually decreases from northwest to southeast the tp has a typical plateau climate characterized by wet and warm summers and cool and dry winters the average annual temperature of tp is 5 75 2 57 c with strongly seasonal and spatial heterogeneities he et al 2021 for example the monthly mean temperature in winter ranges from around 25 c in the west to 15 c in the east while in summer the monthly mean temperature warms to 0 5 c in the east and 5 10 c in the west cui and graf 2009 precipitation accumulation patterns in the tp are also highly variable in both time and space annual precipitation of tp ranges from approximately 1500 mm in the southeast to less than 100 mm in the northwest and more than 60 of total annual precipitation occurs in the summertime zhang et al 2013 in the context of global warming the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events have increased significantly wu et al 2013 highlighting the importance of precipitation investigations in the tp to explore the hydrological utility of both era5 land the imerg precipitation products over the tp as shown in fig 1b the upper yellow river basin uyrb which is above tangnaihai hydrological station is chosen as a typical demonstration basin the uyrb is located between 32 1 36 0 n and 95 8 103 5 e covering a drainage area of approximately 122 103 km2 su et al 2017 although the uyrb only accounts for 16 2 of the whole yellow river basin it provides more than 35 discharge of the yellow river basin serving as one of most important contributing sub basins su et al 2017 besides the uyrb is situated in a semiarid climate region characterized by the typical plateau climate system meanwhile the uyrb has a low population density and neither large reservoirs nor large irrigation projects exist in this area therefore the uyrb is a good testbed for assessing the potential hydrological utility of considered precipitation products over the tp 2 2 datasets three types of precipitation data are employed in this study the benchmark precipitation observed by weather stations the era5 land reanalysis data and the imerg spe in addition for the hydrological modeling some additional model inputs e g temperature and validation datasets e g discharge are also employed in this study 2 2 1 gauge precipitation observations gauge observations are usually employed as the basic benchmark to assess the performance of multi source precipitation products in this study the daily precipitation observations from the chinese national ground weather network which includes 2 426 weather stations are employed as the benchmark precipitation all these gauge observations are subjected to rigorous quality control including the expected maximum check the temporal consistency check and the spatial consistency check li et al 2021a however limited by the high altitude complex terrain and inaccessibility only 112 of the 2426 weather stations are located within the tp the spatial distribution of these weather stations is shown in fig 1b it is clear that the weather stations within the tp are distributed unevenly with relatively dense stations in eastern parts and sparse stations in central and western parts however in comparison to existing studies over the tp e g yuan et al 2021 and he et al 2021 relatively more stations are employed in this study therefore we believe that the observations from these weather stations can act as a receivable benchmark in evaluating and comparing the considered precipitation products in addition to facilitate distributed streamflow simulations the 23 gauge observations see fig 1b surrounding the uyrb are selected and interpolated into 0 1 0 1 grids matching the spatial resolution of both hydrological model and precipitation products by the inverse distance weighting method 2 2 2 era5 land reanalysis precipitation framed within the copernicus climate change service c3s the era5 is produced by the ecmwf benefiting from a decade of developments in model physics core dynamics and data assimilation compared to its predecessor the spatiotemporal resolution and accuracy of the era5 have been greatly improved hersbach et al 2020 the era5 land is an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the era5 in terms of precipitation estimations in the era5 land they are interpolated from the era5 through a linear interpolation method based on a triangular mesh in this way the spatial resolution of precipitation in the era5 land is downscaled to about 9 km from about 31 km in the era5 whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in the era5 muñoz sabater et al 2021 besides unlike previous land reanalysis traditional gauge corrections to the precipitation are not included in the era5 land to enhance the quality of the era5 precipitation this greatly reduces the dependencies of era5 land on external data and makes it possible to obtain near real time data theoretically since the era5 land enables the temporal consistent estimation of precipitation coupled with its long record which shows the high potential capability to support studies of climate and hydrological changes hence the era5 land precipitation is employed in this study since daily scale of the era5 land product is not available it is aggregated from hourly products following cao et al 2019 2 2 3 imerg satellite based precipitation estimations the satellite based precipitation estimations used in this study are the two imerg products building upon the success of the trmm the gpm mission is designed to provide the next generation global observations of rain and snow and thus help to advance our understanding of earth s water and energy budgets designed specifically for the gpm mission the imerg algorithm potentially provides the best precipitation estimations by intercalibrating merging and interpolating all satellite mw based precipitation estimates together with microwave calibrated infrared based precipitation estimations precipitation gauge analyses and potentially other precipitation estimators at fine spatiotemporal scales 0 1 0 1 0 5 h to accommodate the different user requirements the imerg algorithm is run three times for each observation time first giving a quick estimate i e early run imerg e and successively providing a better estimate i e late run imerg l as more data arrive since the monthly gauge data is available the final run of imerg algorithm is to create a research level product i e final run imerg f hence imerg e and imerg l are near real time products that are available about 4 h and 12 h after observation time respectively while imerg f is a post real time product that is released approximately two months after the observation month for a more detailed description of imerg products please refer to huffman et al 2019 combining timeliness and accuracy imerg e and imerg f are assessed and compared in this study to match the records of gauge observations daily imerg products are aggregated from corresponding 0 5 hourly products following su et al 2021 2 2 4 model forcing and validation datasets in this study the grid based xinanjiang model is applied to the uyrb to investigate the hydrological utility of three considered precipitation products over the tp three types of precipitation datasets namely the interpolated gauge observation daily aggregated era5 land and two daily imerg products i e imerg e and imerg f are used as model inputs to perform historical daily streamflow simulations respectively the near surface daily minimum and maximum temperatures required by the grid based xinanjiang model are also obtained from the above mentioned weather stations and re gridded into the regular 0 1 grids note that as suggested by yuan et al 2018 the near surface air temperature is assumed to decrease by 0 65 c per altitude increase of 100 m the daily discharge observations of uyrb are collected from the tangnaihai hydrological station see fig 1b which are available from the china annual hydrological report published by the ministry of water resources limited by availability of these datasets the entire study period is from 2001 to 2018 in which 2001 2010 and 2011 2018 are selected as calibration and validation periods of hydrological modeling respectively 3 methodology 3 1 comparison and evaluation procedures of precipitation products in this study the assessment of three considered precipitation products is based on a pairwise approach i e the point to grid matching method following freitas et al 2020 when there is only one gauge in the native grid of precipitation products the gauge observations are directly matched with grid precipitation if more than one gauge is found in the grid their average values are compared with grid precipitation grids without any gauge are excluded from the analyses to quantify the accuracy of three considered precipitation products the correlation coefficient cc relative bias rbias and normalized root mean square error nrmse are utilized in this study in which cc provides a measure of the linear correlation rbias reflects the system bias i e greater than 0 rbias means the selected precipitation product overestimates the precipitation and vice versa and nrmse shows the average magnitude of error as a rule the higher cc and lower absolute rbias together with lower nrmse signify better performance of the evaluated precipitation products meanwhile the categorical statistical indices i e the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi are also employed to describe the detection performance of the selected precipitation products pod gives the fraction of actual precipitation events correctly detected by the precipitation products while far calculates the fraction of precipitation evens that the precipitation products incorrectly identify csi is an integrated statistic metric that balances pod and far providing an overall detection performance of the selected precipitation products note that according to tian et al 2009 and yong et al 2016 a small value i e 1 mm day is used as the rain no rain threshold to calculate the categorical metrics formulas and perfect values of the above mentioned statistical metrics are listed in table 1 3 2 grid based xinanjiang model and hydrological simulation scenarios the xinanjiang model is a famous conceptual rainfall runoff hydrological model building upon the saturation excess runoff mechanism since it was first proposed by zhao 1992 the xinanjiang model has been widely applied to humid and semi humid catchments of china and has become an operational hydrological model yuan et al 2018 to enhance its applicability a grid based xinanjiang model was developed for user demand li et al 2007 the three soil layer evapotranspiration and saturation excess runoff schemes used in lumped version are inherited by the grid based xinanjiang model to simulate actual evapotranspiration and total runoff in each running grid yuan and ren 2004 meanwhile the total runoff in each grid is divided into three runoff types i e surface interflow and groundwater runoffs by a gravitational water reservoir with bottom and side outlets to represent the hillslope runoff processes then three linear reservoirs are adopted to perform the slope runoff convergence respectively finally the simulated discharge at the outlet of the given catchment is obtained by the muskingum routing method yuan et al 2005 the grid based xinanjiang model is forced by gridded precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in this study the interpolated gauge observations and three considered precipitation products are used as the precipitation inputs severally while the potential evapotranspiration is calculated by daily minimum and maximum near surface temperature via the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1982 the grid based xinanjiang model contains 15 parameters of which 8 parameters are used for actual evapotranspiration and runoff and 7 parameters for hillslope runoff concentration and streamflow routing in this study the shuffled complex evolution global optimization algorithm sce ua developed by duan et al 1994 is adopted to automatically calibrate the model since the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse tends to provide high importance to high flows the maximum sum of nse and its log transformation lognse is used as the objective function to search the optimized model parameters that can accurately capture both high and low flow processes the objective function is defined as 1 f m a x n s e l o g n s e n s e 1 ii 1 n q s i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 l o g n s e 1 i 1 n l o g q s i l o g q o i 2 i 1 n l o g q o i log q o 2 where n represents the sample number q o i and q s i are observed and simulated discharge m 3 s respectively q o and log q o are mean values of corresponding elements in this study two model calibration scenarios are designed to better investigate the hydrological utility of the considered precipitation products scenario i the parameters of the grid based xinanjiang model are calibrated and validated using interpolated gauge observations as the precipitation inputs and then forced by three considered precipitation products respectively without changing model parameters keeping model parameters is beneficial to analyze the effect of precipitation errors on simulation results as well as to analyze the toleration of grid based xinanjiang model to the precipitation error scenario ii the parameters of the grid based xinanjiang model are calibrated and validated using considered precipitation products as the precipitation input respectively the precipitation input specific calibration procedure in this scenario is an important option for hydrological applications of considered precipitation products in ungauged basins without precipitation observations 4 results 4 1 overall comparison of precipitation characteristics in this section we focus on directly comparing the three considered precipitation products against the gauge observations during the entire study period from 2001 to 2018 as shown in fig 2 the gauge observed monthly precipitation illustrates an inverse v shaped trend with the peak that appeared in july as we know due to the uniquely high altitude the tp is characterized by an independent plateau monsoon system whereby the airflow at the lower level around the plateau leads to cyclonic atmospheric circulation in summer and is altered by anti cyclone in the winter maussion et al 2014 as a result most precipitation within the tp falls from may to september and reaches a maximum in july or august thereby giving the tp wet and warm summers and cool and dry winters the evidence from the gauge observed monthly precipitation variation perfectly supports the above mentioned temporal pattern the three considered precipitation products can generally capture the monthly variation tendency revealed by the gauge observations but in terms of precipitation amount there are significant differences the monthly average precipitation of the era5 land is near twice larger than the observed ones for almost all months especially in the cold season from november to the following march whereas the near real time imerg e tends to underestimate precipitation in contrast probably attributing to the monthly gauge calibration the imerg f well reproduces the observed monthly precipitation indicating best performance in estimating the precipitation amount in terms of the spatial distribution the daily average precipitation accumulation and associated seasonal ones derived from the gauge observations and the considered precipitation products are shown in fig 3 and fig s1 respectively as shown in fig 3a a strong spatial heterogeneity of daily average precipitation is observed in the gauge observations with daily precipitation gradually decreasing from southeast to northwest a similar spatial scenario also occurs in spring summer and autumn seasons whereas precipitation is low throughout the tp in winter see the first row of fig s1 such spatial pattern is mainly influenced by the joint effect of various dynamical climate systems specifically in summer the flow caused by the indian summer monsoon and the east asian summer monsoon brings abundant moisture from the arabian sea and the bay of bengal as well as the south china sea and the western pacific zhu et al 2011 this inevitably generates heavy precipitation in the southeast portions of tp in winter with the reduction of monsoon intensity the zonal orientation of the himalayas blocks the synoptic scale exchanges of warm tropical air with cold polar air centered near siberia with the single exception of cold air exchange along the eastern front of the himalayas rees and collins 2006 therefore the vast plateau region just acquires minimal levels of moisture produced by the westerly winds the spatial distribution patterns of gauge observations shown in fig s1 are consistent with our expectations based on knowledge of large scale seasonal patterns from atmospheric flows in the tp compared with the gauge observations pronounced differences can be found between era5 land and imerg products era5 land can coarsely capture the spatial variability of gauge observations in both annual and season scales which however tend to overestimate the precipitation amount such result is consistent with the evaluation results of era land in fig 2 besides visually the spatial patter of two imerg products is more consistent with gauge observations than era5 land while the average precipitation of imerg f is much closer to the observed ones than the imerg e fig 4 and fig s2 show the average precipitation frequency for the gauge observations and three considered precipitation products in annual and season scales respectively note that a small value of 1 mm day same as the threshold used in the calculation of categorical metrics is employed to determine the occurrence of precipitation events for calculating the precipitation frequency with an average value of 23 58 the precipitation frequency of gauge observations ranges from 1 88 to 49 02 following the spatial pattern of precipitation amount shown in fig 3a in other words regions with high precipitation amounts generally have a relatively high precipitation frequency besides like the seasonal differences in precipitation amount the precipitation frequency also exhibits significant seasonal variation the highest precipitation frequency occurs in summer average value of 47 02 followed by spring and autumn with an average value of 3 82 winter has the lowest precipitation frequency in contrast era5 land grossly overestimates the actual precipitation frequency in both annual fig 4b and seasonal fig s2 scales similar results can also be found in yuan et al 2021 which even suggested that the overestimation of era5 in precipitation amount is mainly caused by the overestimation of precipitation frequency as for the imerg products with slightly better performance of imerg f the occurrence frequency of daily precipitation is much closer to the gauge observations than that in era5 land since the gauge calibration in imerg f operated by monthly gpcc data does not change precipitation events xu et al 2016 the better performance of imerg f in precipitation frequency is mainly attributed to the employment of more additional microwave sensors and the bidirectional propagation algorithm of passive microwave only forward propagation of the microwave data used in imerg e su et al 2021 4 2 statistical performance of the three considered precipitation products to spatially analyze the temporal performance of three considered precipitation products the basic statistical indices i e cc rbias and nrmse are calculated and shown in fig 5 clearly imerg f shares a quite similar spatial pattern of cc metric with that of imerg e but imerg f has a significantly higher average cc value 0 64 vs 0 57 highlighting the improved linear consistency of imerg f with the gauge observations although the spatial average cc value of era5 land is between that of the two imerg products the spatial distribution of them shows a distinct difference for example the larger cc values of imerg products are mainly distributed in the southern parts of the tp while those of era5 land are primarily located on the east parts of the tp as for the rbias metric era5 land remarkably overestimates the precipitation amount with a spatial average rbias of 66 40 regions of high rbias in era5 land are mainly distributed in the southern parts of the tp where positive rbias is generally higher than 80 compared with cc metric shown in fig 5a we can even infer that the low cc values of era5 land over these regions are probably caused by the high overestimation with an average rbias values of 24 46 imerg e underestimates the precipitation amount over most of the tp but remarkably overestimates the precipitation amount on the northern edge of the qaidam basin see fig 1b rbias of imerg f is characterized by an alternate distribution of positive and negative values attributing to the mutual ablation of positive and negative values average rbias of imerg f is best of the three considered gpps however the clear overestimations in some regions like the northern edge of the qaidam basin and the southwestern border of the tp still cannot be ignored interestingly although era5 land has a remarkably higher rbias than imerg products the nrmse values of them are in the same order that share a similar spatial distribution as for the capacity of precipitation detection in terms of pod far and csi metrics shown in fig 6 era5 land demonstrates the highest pod values average value of 0 88 of the three considered precipitation products indicating the highest accuracy in detecting actual precipitation events however with a spatial average value of 0 50 it also has the highest far values this situation is closely related to the overestimated precipitation frequency in the era5 land product fig 4b vs fig 4a particularly for light rain in detail additional precipitation events reflected by high precipitation frequency in era5 land increase the probability of correct detection and synchronously increase the risk of misstatement hence the overall detection performance according to csi metric of era5 land is in the same order of magnitude as that of two imerg products as for the intercomparison of the two imerg products they share almost identical spatial distributions of pod and far metrics while imerg f has a clearly higher pod and a slightly higher far than imerg e therefore the csi metrics of imerg f are generally higher than that of imerg e indicting slight better performance in detecting precipitation occurrence due to the high probability of false precipitation events all three considered precipitation products show poor detection performance around the qaidam basin hence reducing the frequency of false precipitation alarms over these regions and thus improving the overall accuracy remains an important future task for both reanalysis and satellite based precipitation products developers previous investigations and studies have suggested that the performance of both reanalysis and satellite based precipitation products shows a strong seasonal variation chen et al 2020 guo et al 2021 tong et al 2014 to explore the performance stability of considered precipitation products over the tp the season statistical metrics of them are shown and compared in fig 7 with median values wavering around 0 6 cc metric of era5 land is relatively stable over the four seasons however rbias and nrmse of era5 land in winter are significantly higher than those in other three seasons from fig 7e the high probability of false precipitation events high far contributes most to the high rbias and nrmse of era5 land in winter of course the low precipitation amount see fig 2 which reduces the denominator of rbias and nrmse is also an important reason as for the imerg products the low cc and high nrmse values indicate that their performance in winter is also much poorer than in other three seasons pod and far based analyses show that the imerg products can hardly detect precipitation events accurately in winter this is mainly related to the fact that winter precipitation on the tp is dominated by snowfall generally solid precipitation estimations are 10 times more complex than liquid precipitation estimations and thus snowfall estimations from satellite sensors are usually unreliable skofronick jackson et al 2017a a similar situation was also reported by ma et al 2016 for the northeastern tp hence both era5 land and imerg products should be used with caution in winter 4 3 hydrological utility evaluation of the three considered precipitation products in the previous section the three considered precipitation products are systematically assessed and compared against gauge observations over the entire tp while their hydrological utility in basin scale is also a meaningful topic of heightened concern hence in this season the hydrological utilities of three considered precipitation products in daily streamflow simulation are evaluated using the grid based xinanjiang model over the uyrb fig 8 depicts the daily observed hydrograph and corresponding simulated hydrograph forced by interpolated gauge observations at the tangnaihai station the figure demonstrates that the simulated streamflow agrees well with the observations and can capture the key fluctuation trend of observed hydrograph in both calibration and verification periods with performance metrics of nse and lognse larger than 0 85 see table 2 the performance of the grid based xinanjiang model is very stable in the two periods hence the grid based xinanjiang model is suitable for hydrological simulation in the uyrb and can be used to evaluate the hydrological performance of considered precipitation products the gauge based calibrated grid based xinanjiang model is then forced by the three considered precipitation products to investigate their hydrological utilities in the uyrb directly the simulated daily discharges are shown in fig 9 against observed daily discharges the performance metrics computed between the simulated and observed hydrographs are also given in table 2 compared with the gauge forced simulation three precipitation products forced simulations all show remarkable performance degradation especially for the era5 land and imerg e products the era5 land forced simulation severely overestimates the actual streamflow whereas the imerg e based simulation significantly underestimates the actual streamflow the main reason can be related to their overestimation or underestimation of precipitation amount see section 4 2 besides the model parameters calibrated by interpolated observations are not optimal for them is also an important reason interestingly despite the undeniable over or under estimation the variation trend or seasonal fluctuation of both era5 land and imerg e driven simulations is very consistent with that of the observed hydrograph this may suggest that the era5 land and imerg e can reconstruct seasonal interannual and decadal variabilities of precipitation as for the imerg f intuitively the simulated discharges match well with the observed values highlighting the added value of monthly gauge calibration however with poor performance in the calibration period and better performance in the validation period 0 68 vs 0 72 for nse and 0 57 vs 0 75 for lognse respectively the simulation performance of imerg f is still not stable enough to investigate the hydrological utilities of three considered precipitation products in the ungauged basins the grid based xinanjiang model is recalibrated and validated using individual precipitation product as the input for the same study periods visual comparisons and associated diagnostic metrics of simulations are presented in fig 10 and table 3 respectively clearly the performance of precipitation input specific calibrated simulations in scenario ii is much better than that in scenario i using gauge calibrated model parameters as evidenced by higher nse and lognse in all the study periods this phenomenon indicates that the input specific calibration can effectively improve the hydrological utilities of the precipitation product which also confirms that the gauge calibrated model parameters cannot be directly transplanted to precipitation products forced simulations comparison between fig 9 and fig 10 shows that the model parameters recalibration can greatly suppress the systematic bias of precipitation input and thus enhance the tolerance of the hydrological model to the precipitation error comparatively the era5 land forced simulation demonstrates comparable performance to the imerg f but it is more likely to miss high flow peaks e g in 2011 2012 2013 and 2018 although the simulation performance has been improved significantly by recalibration of model parameters limited by inefficiencies in simulating high flows lower nse and higher lognse the imerg e forced simulation still performs worst among the three considered precipitation products in addition in the two model parameter calibration scenarios none of the three considered precipitation products perform better than the interpolated gauge observations indicating that both reanalysis and satellite based precipitation cannot replace gauge observations in providing the most accurate and stable discharge simulations 5 discussion 5 1 comparison between point to grid and grid to grid assessments of precipitation products in this study three precipitation products i e era5 land imerg e and imerg f are statistically assessed and compared over the tp and their hydrological utilities are investigated in the uyrb since the weather stations in the tp are not dense enough the statistical assessment is operated through the point to grid matching approach this means that the regional average precipitation on the grid greater than100 km 2 is directly compared to the observed values at a special point such spatial mismatching may bias the assessment results especially in regions with high spatial heterogeneity of precipitation assessing the grid based precipitation through grid to grid matching approach by using interpolated observations as the benchmark is another important alternative in grid precipitation evaluation grid to grid matching scheme can avoid spatial mismatching but the interpolation may introduce uncertainty into the interpolated benchmark and the sparser of observations the higher uncertainty of interpolated benchmark zhang et al 2020 fig 11 compares the performance of the three considered precipitation products using the two spatial matching approaches in the uyrb results indicate that the era5 land performs better in grid to grid matching approach than that in point to grid approach with higher cc average value of 0 69 vs 0 62 comparable rbias and lower nrmse average value of 1 76 vs 2 08 in contrast from point to grid matching to grid to grid matching the two imerg products both exhibit slight performance degradation evidenced by the reduced cc values this is mainly due to a fact that the interpolation can lead to false precipitation signals and a similar situation also occurs for downscaling in terms of categorical metrics the era land presents lower far and higher csi metrics in grid to grid matching approach than that in point to grid approach whereas the detection performance of imerg products is significantly reduced this confirms the above inference again tan 2019 suggested that the availability and distribution of the precipitation gauges are the most important considerations to decide which spatial matching approach to be adopted if a network including high density and well distributed precipitation gauges is available the grid to grid matching approach is more suitable otherwise interpolation of gauge observations may reduce the spatial variability of precipitation and further reduce the reliability of interpolated gauge reference in fact if gauge stations are not dense enough or unevenly distributed even using the point to grid matching approach the diagnostic information of considered precipitation products can also be missed in some regions for example due to lacking gauge observations the performance of three considered precipitation products over central and western parts of tp is still unclear in this study hence to obtain accurate precipitation knowledge of the tp a denser gauge network with good quality precipitation observations is urgently needed especially in the central and western parts of tp besides as suggested by li et al 2021b good data sharing and management is also particularly important for addressing today s data scarce challenge 5 2 error propagation from precipitation to simulated discharge with increasing temporal and spatial resolution globally available precipitation products have made their exploitation in hydrological applications possible especially in data scarce regions since all the precipitation products have their own strengths and limitations in accuracy and spatial temporal representativeness understanding how uncertainties transfer from input precipitation to simulated discharge through the hydrological model has been identified as one of the critical issues for simplify a linear relationship between precipitation error and hydrological simulation is often considered mei et al 2016 nanding et al 2021 in this assumption hydrologic models may amplify or dampen precipitation error through the complex runoff generation and confluence process nanding et al 2021 su et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 meanwhile a few other studies suggested that propagation of precipitation errors through hydrological modeling varies with seasons and is closely associated with the hydrological model formulation and the basin characteristics camici et al 2018 for instance nikolopoulos et al 2010 found that the error propagation from precipitation to simulated discharge depends on the basin size whereas no such signal was found in the study of falck et al 2015 hence although error propagation of precipitation in hydrological modeling has been investigated in various studies due to the strong nonlinearity in hydrological processes it still remains unclear and sometimes controversial in this section the interpolated observations and corresponding simulated discharge are employed as the benchmark to investigate precipitation error propagation through the grid based xinanjiang model in the uyrb from fig 8 and table 2 discharge simulation forced by the interpolated gauge observations exhibits excellent performance throughout the study period and can serve as the benchmark in the precipitation error propagation analysis since the categorical metrics provide limited information in the selection of precipitation products for hydrological modeling camici et al 2020 they are not considered in this section by comparing fig 9 and fig 10 with table 4 some insights have been noted that the cc metric is also not reliable in precipitation error propagation analysis for example in the basin average precipitation comparison the era5 land has a high cc value of 0 91 although the cc value of era5 land forced simulation is still as high as 0 93 its hydrological performance is really poor in scenario i fig 9a in contrast rbias along with nrmse seem to be more appropriate for analyzing precipitation error propagation through the hydrological model normally keeping hydrological model parameters i e scenario i in this study the precipitation products characterized by absolute rbias values close to 0 and low nrmse values allow for better simulation however in the uyrb the systematic errors in terms of rbias can be more than double from input precipitation to simulated discharge this finding is in line with maggioni et al 2013 however with respect to the nrmse no useful knowledge is found to characterize precipitation error propagation in scenario i some studies considered a nrmse value of lower than 0 5 in spite of lacking evidence to justify this value to be associated with good hydrological simulation satgé et al 2019 however none of the three considered precipitation products meets this requirement in the uyrb this may explain the non action of nrmse metric in precipitation error propagation in scenario i over the uyrb besides previous studies have demonstrated that the input specific recalibration of model parameters can reduce the influence of imperfect precipitation input and thus obtain good hydrological performances camici et al 2020 su et al 2021 in this case the improved discharge simulation performance in scenario ii comparing fig 10 with fig 9 confirms this finding from table 4 it is clear that the error in terms of rbias and nrmse decreases greatly from input precipitation to simulated discharge through the grid based xinanjiang model this means that the adjustment of model parameters can increase the tolerance of the hydrological model to input errors although rbias and nrmse are not the objective functions in the parametric calibration scheme however model parameters recalibrated by imperfect precipitation input e g spes or reanalysis data may not be sufficient to characterize the natural basin feature and thus result in lower predictive capability in internal sub basins su et al 2021 or other model outputs like evapotranspiration zhang et al 2020 hence more research studies focusing on error propagation should be recommended to form a general guideline about which performance metric s and associated range can be used to ensure good hydrological performances besides potential influence of hydrological model formulation and associated model parameters calibration scheme and basin characteristics also need to be clarified by future studies 6 conclusions reanalysis and satellite based precipitation products with high quality and fine spatial temporal resolutions have provided unprecedented opportunities for hydrological simulation but end users are still struggling with their unclear uncertainties especially for the latest released products this study assesses the performance of recently released era5 land products and compares it with two imerg products from 2001 to 2018 with a special focus on their hydrological modeling capability the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the era5 land well reproduces the intra annual variation and spatial temporal pattern of precipitation over the tp but it severely overestimates the precipitation amount and precipitation frequency while the imerg e underestimates them in contrast the imerg f performs best among the three considered precipitation products in estimating the precipitation amount 2 the era5 land has the highest pod and far values indicating that it performs best in detecting actual precipitation events but also contains many false precipitation events the imerg products have remarkably lower pod and far values but overall detection performance in terms of csi of them is in the same measure as the era5 land besides all three considered products should be used with caution in winter 3 the simulated discharge forced by the interpolated gauge observations agree well with the observed hydrographs highlighting the excellent performance of the grid based xinanjiang model in the uyrb keeping model parameters the era5 land and imerg e demonstrate poorly simulated performance due to their high systematic error while much better performance ns 0 7 and logns 0 65 is noted for the imerg f 4 employing input specific calibrated model parameters significantly improves the simulation performance of three systematic in this context the era5 land demonstrates comparable simulation performance to the imerg f but still worse than the interpolated gauge observation considering its long record the era5 land exhibits high added values in the reconstruction of historical discharge although the imerg e forced simulation still has some shortcomings in the uyrb it still shows good potential due to the short time lag in summary to reply to the above mentioned scientific question we recommend that the appropriate precipitation product should be selected according to their own research purposes for near real time applications the imerg e is a very valuable candidate if accurate precipitation is required the imerg f can be considered the era5 land can play an essential role in the

1999,the log box cox and log sinh transformations have been widely used for the purpose of data normalization in hydrological applications focusing on the skewness and censoring characteristics of precipitation data this paper has developed a novel newton type algorithm for the comprehensive implementation of the three transformations specifically the likelihood functions are formulated by using the classic z score and the jacobian determinants of the three transformations the gradient vectors are analytically derived to determine the searching directions and grid based starts are devised to facilitate the convergence to the global optimal to test the effectiveness of the algorithm numerical experiments are devised for monthly precipitation data from the global precipitation climatology centre the results show that the log transformation reduces the positive skewness by using a simple offset parameter the box cox transformation is flexible for data normalization and incurs slightly high computational costs more than 80 function evaluations and the log sinh transformation is computational efficient in normalizing precipitation data less than 40 function evaluations for the three transformations multiple starts are in demand to handle local optimal and 10 grid based starts for each parameter are shown to be sufficient for the algorithm to reach the global optimal after transformation skewness and kurtosis coefficients are reduced to nearly 0 in most regions and the kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk tests suggest that transformed data follow gaussian distribution at the significance level of 0 05 overall the newton type algorithm can serve to implement the log box cox and log sinh transformations for effective hydrological modelling and

variables with profound socioeconomic impacts barnett et al 2005 kidd huffman 2011 kotz et al 2022 in practice precipitation is observed by rain gauges at the local scale and is also inferred from weather radars and remote sensing satellites at regional and global scales kidd huffman 2011 skofronick jackson et al 2017 sun et al 2018 in the meantime climate models and assimilation techniques are developed to integrate precipitation measurements from multiple sources to generate gridded precipitation datasets becker et al 2013 beck et al 2019 these quantitative observations lay the basis for the modeling of precipitation to facilitate the understanding of hydroclimatic processes and inform water resources management gong et al 2020 shrestha et al 2020 also statistical models based on the long term records of precipitation serve as important tools to estimate the probabilities of extreme precipitation and meteorological droughts for disaster planning marra et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b the probability distribution of precipitation data has long been a topic of interest for the modeling of precipitation papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 ye et al 2018 martinez villalobos neelin 2019 the skewness and censoring are two of the most important characteristics stagge et al 2015 papalexiou koutsoyiannis 2016 specifically skewness refers to the extent of asymmetry of probability distributions precipitation data tend to exhibit positive skewness since there are a large proportion of small values and also some extreme values ye et al 2018 martinez villalobos neelin 2019 the censoring indicates that the observed values of precipitation cannot be smaller than zero as precipitation is an intermittent process of wet and dry spells papalexiou 2022 on the other hand there is an underlying assumption of gaussian distribution for popular statistical models used in hydrology such as the triple collocation method for data merging li et al 2018 chen et al 2022 and the autoregressive model for time series analysis alaya et al 2015 mehdizadeh et al 2017 overall the skewness and censoring characteristics are challenging for statistical modeling of precipitation wang et al 2010 cecinati et al 2017 mcinerney et al 2019 data transformation has been widely used for the purpose of data normalization to enable effective statistical modeling box cox 1964 yeo johnson 2000 wang et al 2012 there exist three popular transformations i e the log transformation johnson 1949 keene 1995 the box cox transformation box cox 1964 and the log sinh transformation wang et al 2012 the log transformation which has an offset parameter employs the natural logarithm function to reduce the positive skewness of hydrological data lopez 2011 lien et al 2016 li et al 2018 the box cox transformation which has a power parameter and an offset parameter presents a family of power transformations for the normalization of hydrological data bates campbell 2001 erdin et al 2012 del giudice et al 2013 the log sinh transformation which has an intercept parameter and a slope parameter deals with the heteroscedasticity of hydrological data robertson et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 schepen et al 2018 these three transformations have been extensively used in streamflow forecasting wang et al 2012 mcinerney et al 2017 drought monitoring vasiliades loukas 2009 angelidis et al 2012 and quantitative precipitation estimation erdin et al 2012 chen et al 2022 the transformation parameters play a critical part in data normalization under the log box cox and log sinh transformations thyer et al 2002 erdin et al 2012 cecinati et al 2017 for the sake of simplicity the transformation parameters can be fixed by using some empirical values mcinerney et al 2018 wu et al 2019 li et al 2021 for example in streamflow forecasting the power parameter of the box cox transformation can be fixed to 0 2 0 35 or 0 5 and the offset parameter can be set to a constant slightly larger than zero bates campbell 2001 del giudice et al 2013 mcinerney et al 2017 nevertheless the skewness and censoring characteristics vary by region and by season which can diminish the effectiveness of fixed parameters wang et al 2010 erdin et al 2012 cecinati et al 2017 in addition the censoring characteristic i e the lower bound limits the applicability of parameters estimated in humid and sub humid regions to semi arid and arid regions wang robertson 2011 mcinerney et al 2019 huang et al 2022 therefore efforts have been devoted to effective implementations of the log box cox and log sinh transformations by developing numerical algorithms for parameter estimation box cox 1964 thyer et al 2002 wang et al 2012 and also by large sample crash testing erdin et al 2012 mcinerney et al 2017 berthet et al 2020 focusing on the skewness and censoring characteristics of precipitation data this paper proposes a novel newton type algorithm for the comprehensive implementation of the log box cox and log sinh transformations specifically the likelihood functions are formulated by using the classic z score and the jacobian determinants of the three transformations the gradient vectors are analytically derived to determine the searching directions doherty 2003 nocedal and wright 2006 arnold et al 2012 and furthermore grid based starts are devised to facilitate the convergence to the global optimal skahill doherty 2006 tolson shoemaker 2007 kavetski et al 2018 to test the effectiveness of the newton type algorithm numerical experiments are devised to implement the log box cox and log sinh transformations for the precipitation data from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc s full data monthly product as will be demonstrated through the results the algorithm yields diagnostic insights into the efficiency and convergence of the transformations while monthly precipitation data generally do not follow the gaussian distribution the log box cox and log sinh transformations implemented by the newton type algorithm are effective in improving the normality 2 data transformations 2 1 log transformation the log transformation is based on the natural logarithm function johnson 1949 keene 1995 1 y log x log x c where x represents original precipitation data and c is the offset parameter that is positive to make the log transformation available for zero values lien et al 2016 berthet et al 2020 the parameter c can be scaled to the dimensionless c mcinerney et al 2018 woldemeskel et al 2018 2 c c x max where x max represents the maximum value of precipitation data in this way the c is independent of the magnitude of precipitation data from eq 1 the first and second order derivatives are derived 3 y log x x c 1 y log x x c 2 the first and second order derivatives are respectively positive and negative indicating that the log transformation is monotonically increasing and concave overall the log transformation can reduce the positive skewness of precipitation data because it tends to compress large values and in the meantime extend small values van zwet 1964 yeo johnson 2000 the effect of transformation tends to reduce as the value of c increases 4 y log x x c log c for c x in particular when c is much greater than x the log transformation is equivalent to an affine transformation that has little effect on skewness 2 2 box cox transformation the box cox transformation is developed by modifying the classic power transformations to handle the discontinuity when the power parameter is zero tukey 1957 box cox 1964 sakia 1992 5 y box cox x x λ 2 λ 1 1 λ 1 if λ 1 0 log x λ 2 if λ 1 0 where λ 1 and λ 2 are respectively the power and offset parameters when the value of λ 1 is 0 5 0 and 1 the box cox transformation is respectively equivalent to the classic square root log and reciprocal transformations the value of λ 2 is positive and it can be scaled by x max mcinerney et al 2018 6 λ 2 λ 2 x max where λ 2 is the dimensionless form of λ 2 the first and second order derivatives under the box cox transformation are 7 y box cox x x λ 2 λ 1 1 y box cox x λ 1 1 x λ 2 λ 1 2 the first order derivative in eq 7 is positive indicating that the box cox transformation is monotonically increasing by contrast the sign of the second order derivative depends on the value of λ 1 specifically y box cox x becomes positive or negative when the value of λ 1 is larger or smaller than one the indication is that the box cox transformation can be either concave or convex therefore the box cox transformation with λ 1 less than 1 or λ 1 greater than 1 can reduce or increase the skewness of precipitation data van zwet 1964 yeo johnson 2000 2 3 log sinh transformation the log sinh transformation combines the natural logarithm function with the hyperbolic sine function wang et al 2012 robertson et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 8 y log sinh x 1 b log sinh a b x where a and b are respectively the intercept and slope parameters for the hyperbolic sine function the two parameters are positive and b can be scaled by x max li et al 2013 berthet et al 2020 bennett et al 2021 9 b b x max where b is the dimensionless form of b the first and second order derivatives under the log sinh transformation are 10 y log sinh x coth a b x y log sinh x b csch 2 a b x where coth and csch are respectively hyperbolic cotangent and cosecant functions from eq 10 the positive first order derivative indicates that the log sinh transformation is monotonically increasing and the negative second order derivative suggests that this transformation is concave a and b respectively control the lower and upper references of the transformation wang et al 2012 del giudice et al 2013 wu et al 2019 for the log sinh transformation it is noted that 11 y log sinh x 1 b l o g a b x f o r a b x 0 y log sinh x x a b l o g 2 b f o r a b x 3 as can be seen the log sinh transformation tends to be the log transformation when the values of a and b are small and it becomes similar to the affine transformation for large values of a and b berthet et al 2020 2 4 an illustrative example an illustrative example is presented in fig 1 to showcase the three popular transformations in fig 1a to 1c the transformed precipitation data are plotted against the original precipitation data yeo johnson 2000 it can be seen that the three monotonically increasing transformations preserve the order of original precipitation data and that the relationships between original and transformed precipitation data depend on the transformation parameters 1 for the log transformation fig 1a the points tend to align along a straight line as c increases indicating a reduced effect on skewness 2 for the box cox transformation fig 1b the plot is concave under λ 1 0 5 and becomes convex when λ 1 1 5 3 for the log sinh transformation fig 1c the increases of a and b respectively reduce the effect of the transformation on small and large values the normal probability plots in fig 1d to 1f compare the z scores of original and transformed precipitation data against standard gaussian variates if the points align along the 1 1 line then the z scores are shown to follow the standard gaussian distribution on the other hand if the points at both sides tend to bend above or below the 1 1 line then the z scores tend to exhibit positive or negative skewness buuren and fredriks 2001 as is indicated by the black diamonds the original precipitation data are evidently positively skewed in the meantime it can be observed that the characteristic of skewness varies under different sets of transformation parameters this result points to the critical part that the transformation parameters play in determining the statistical properties of transformed precipitation data box cox 1964 yeo johnson 2000 wang et al 2012 3 newton type algorithm 3 1 overview of the algorithm this paper proposes a newton type algorithm for the comprehensive implementation of the log box cox and log sinh transformations as shown in fig 2 the algorithm is composed of five steps 1 the likelihood function is derived from the classic z score and the jacobian determinant to account for the skewness and censoring characteristics of precipitation data 2 the analytical expressions of gradients vectors are derived from the formulated likelihood functions under the three transformation 3 the grid based starts are devised in the multi start strategy to facilitate the convergence to the global optimal 4 the optimal transformation parameters are estimated by using the likelihood functions gradient vectors and multi start strategy and 5 the skewed and censored precipitation data are transformed by the log box cox and log sinh transformations 3 2 formulation of likelihood functions the likelihood function to characterize the joint probability of skewed and censored precipitation data x x 1 x 2 x n is formulated 12 l θ x i ω 1 pd f x x i i ω 0 cd f x x 0 where l θ x represents the likelihood function under the parameter set θ for the given precipitation data x x 0 represents the censoring threshold to determine uncensored xi x 0 versus censored precipitation data xi x 0 ω1 ω0 represents the sub set of uncensored censored data in x and pd f x and cd f x respectively represent the probability density function pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf for x for uncensored data pd f x in eq 12 is derived from the pdf of z scores which are assumed to follow the standard gaussian distribution under the three transformations and the jacobian determinant of transformation box cox 1964 wang et al 2012 13 pd f x x i y x i 1 σ y 2 π e 1 2 y x i μ y σ y 2 where y x i represents the transformed value of xi y x i is the first order derivative in the jacobian determinant of transformation and μ y and σ y are respectively the parameters of mean and standard deviation for transformed data y as can be seen pd f x accounts for the skewness characteristic of precipitation data by combining the z score and jacobian determinant for censored data cd f x in eq 12 is expressed by the cdf for the z score of transformed x 0 14 cd f x x 0 1 2 1 e r f y x 0 μ y σ y 2 where y x 0 represents the transformed value of x 0 and e r f u 2 π 0 u e t 2 d t is the error function specifically the precise values of censored data which are known to be less than or equal to x 0 are not available wang robertson 2011 mcinerney et al 2019 huang et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 therefore for all the censored data cd f x x 0 is introduced to account for the lumped probability mass at x 0 allowing for the consideration of the censoring characteristic of precipitation data for the three transformations the log likelihood functions are detailed by specifying the jacobian determinant 1 for the log transformation 15 log l log θ x i ω 1 y x i n 1 log σ y 2 σ y 2 1 i ω 1 y x i μ

data and c represents the constant terms that will be omitted in the following mathematical formulations in eqs 15 to 17 the parameters in θ for the three transformations are listed in table 1 and they are determined by the classic maximum log likelihood estimation thyer et al 2002 erdin et al 2012 cecinati et al 2017 3 3 derivation of gradient vectors the gradient vectors of the log likelihood functions are composed of the first order partial derivatives with respect to the parameters in θ 1 for the log transformation the gradient vector is 18 log l log θ x log l log θ x c log l log θ x μ y

expressions of the gradient vectors costly finite difference operations are no longer in demand 3 4 design of multi start strategy the multi start strategy makes use of the regular gridded sampling skahill doherty 2006 tolson shoemaker 2007 kavetski clark 2010 specifically the range of each parameter is uniformly discretized to generate multiple regularly spaced points 24 θ l θ l δ θ u θ l m 1 θ u for δ 1 2 m 2 where θ l and θ u respectively represent the lower and upper bounds of the parameter range and m represents the pre specified number of regular points in this way all possible combinations of regular points for different parameters determine multiple grid points that are uniformly distributed in the parameter space these grid points represent initial estimates of θ and are used as the grid based starts 25 θ 0 1 θ 0 2 θ 0 m where m represents the number of grid based starts it is noted that the multiple grid based starts are meant to prevent the entrapments in local optimal and facilitate the convergence to the global optimal 3 5 estimation of transformation parameters the minimization of the negative number of log likelihood functions which is equivalent to the maximization of the likelihood functions is performed in order to estimate θ 26 θ e arg min θ log l θ x θ l θ θ u where θ e represents the set of estimated parameters and θ l and θ u are respectively the sets of lower and upper bounds the newton type methods begin with a grid based start and find θ e through iterative computations nocedal wright 2006 27 θ k 1 θ k h k 1 g k where θ k is the parameter set in the k th iteration and h k 1 and g k are respectively the inverse hessian matrix and gradient vector evaluated by θ k the multi start strategy allows the newton type methods to begin with a number of pre defined grid based starts eq 25 which preserves the deterministic performance of the algorithm the gradient vector and the inverse hessian matrix are updated in every iteration specifically g k is calculated for the negative log likelihood functions 28 g k log l θ k x where log l θ k x represents the gradient vectors for the three transformations it is noted that the popular broyden fletcher goldfard shano bfgs method is employed to update the approximation of the hessian matrix in each iteration byrd et al 1995 zhu et al 1997 the optimal parameter set θ opt is selected from all the estimated parameter sets obtained under the multi start strategy 29 θ opt argmin θ e log l θ e d x f o r d 1 2 m where θ e d represents the set of estimated parameters under the d th start given a set of precipitation data and a transformation θ opt is selected as the optimal parameter set that minimizes the negative number of the log likelihood function 3 6 transformation of precipitation data precipitation data are transformed by θ opt and then converted into z scores vasiliades loukas 2009 angelidis et al 2012 30 z x i y x i μ y σ y where z x i is the z score corresponding to the transformed value y x i and μ y and σ y are respectively the parameters of mean and standard deviation in θ opt for censored data the corresponding z scores do not have precise values thus the pseudo z scores zc are generated 31 z c n 0 1 2 f o r z c z 0 where z 0 is the z score of y x 0 specifically the pseudo z scores zc are randomly sampled from the standard gaussian distribution in the range of zc z 0 overall through the newton type algorithm the skewed and censored precipitation data are transformed to follow the standard gaussian distribution 4 numerical experiments 4 1 precipitation dataset numerical experiments of the gpcc monthly precipitation are devised to test the effectiveness of the proposed newton type algorithm the gpcc integrates a large number of gauge based observations from different sources and produces the gridded precipitation dataset by interpolation methods becker et al 2013 schneider et al 2020 the monthly precipitation data from 1970 to 2019 at the spatial resolution of 1 is obtained from the gpcc full data monthly product version 2020 it has three dimensions 32 p p t y x where p represents the gpcc precipitation dataset and p represents observed value specified by time t latitude y and longitude x specifically t is the number of hours since the beginning of january 1891 representing the month of precipitation observations y ranges from 89 5 89 5 n to 89 5 89 5 s and x is from 179 5 179 5 w to 179 5 179 5 e herein the monthly precipitation data for july are retrieved for data transformation to account for the seasonality of precipitation in the gpcc dataset it is noted that there can be mostly censored values in arid regions in addition missing values in regions without any gauge stations are filled with the long term average which can lead to a number of duplicated values schneider et al 2020 in both cases the small size of unique samples affects the effectiveness of parameter estimation and normality tests razali et al 2011 carbone et al 2018 therefore the attention is paid to land grid cells with at least ten unique uncensored data the newton type algorithm is implemented to transform precipitation data for each grid cell under investigation that is precipitation data is extracted from p by specifying the month latitude and longitude 33 p july y i x i p j where j is the year in the period from 1970 to 2019 a censoring threshold of 0 01 mm is used in the formulation of the likelihood function eq 12 the threshold is set to be slightly larger than zero to account for the minimum measurable precipitation amount robertson et al 2013 schepen et al 2018 huang et al 2022 4 2 settings of the algorithm the ranges of transformation parameters in the algorithm implementations of the log box cox and log sinh transformations are listed in table 2 the ranges of c λ 2 and b are defined by dimensionless c eq 2 λ 2 eq 6 and b eq 9 which facilitates inter comparisons at the global scale mcinerney et al 2018 berthet et al 2020 the lower and upper bounds are determined by following the parameter ranges previously used for the transformation of hydrological data box cox 1964 wang et al 2012 lien et al 2016 mcinerney et al 2017 berthet et al 2020 specifically the lower bounds close to zero are set for the transformation parameters except for λ 1 that are defined to be positive box cox 1964 wang et al 2012 also the high upper bounds lead to relatively wide parameter ranges which allows the newton type algorithm to find the optimal transformation parameters for various precipitation data in humid and arid regions for λ 1 the value ranges from 2 to 2 so that the box cox transformation can be either concave or convex the grid based starts are set under the pre specified ranges of parameters specifically λ 1 is sampled at the linear scale while the other transformation parameters are sampled at the logarithmic scale the logarithmic scale is meant to deal with transformation parameters that vary across several orders of magnitude wang et al 2012 berthet et al 2020 the initial estimates of μy and σy depend on the values of transformation parameters and precipitation samples that is given the initial estimates of transformation parameters the mean and standard deviation of transformed samples are used as the initial estimates of μy and σy in this way multiple grid based starts are generated by considering the dependence of the mean μy and the standard deviation σy on the magnitude of precipitation data and transformation parameters thyer et al 2002 five numbers of grid based starts for each transformation parameter are investigated in numerical experiments that is the range of each parameter is discretized into 3 5 10 30 and 50 regular points eq 24 for the log transformation the regular points of c are used as grid based starts for the box cox and log sinh transformations there are 3 3 9 5 5 25 10 10 100 30 30 900 and 50 50 2500 grid based starts it is noted that the density of gridding is reasonably high when 50 grid based starts are used for each parameter as a result the corresponding optimal parameter set is considered to be the global optimal 4 3 normality indicators the skewness coefficient kurtosis coefficient and the p values of one sample kolmogorov smirnov test and shapiro wilk test are used to assess the extent to which the z scores of original and transformed precipitation data follow the standard gaussian distribution razali et al 2011 mcinerney et al 2017 svensson et al 2017 laimighofer laaha 2022 the four normality indicators are independently calculated in each grid cell under investigation 34 p d y i x i p j where p d y i x i represents the set of the z scores p j of original or transformed data d for a specified grid cell i the skewness coefficient cs indicates the positive negative skewness 35 c s e p d y i x i μ p 3 e p d y i x i μ p 2 3 2 the kurtosis coefficient ck measures the heavy light tail 36 c k e p d y i x i μ p 4 e p d y i x i μ p 2 2 3 where e represents the expectation operator and μp is the mean of p d y i x i cs and ck which are descriptive tend toward zero for the standard gaussian distribution for precipitation data it is noted that positive cs and ck which indicate a heavy tail on the right side of the probability distribution are usually observed papalexiou et al 2013 ye et al 2018 martinez villalobos neelin 2019 the p values for the one sample kolmogorov smirnov test and the shapiro wilk test are calculated for comparison with the significance level of 0 05 when the p values are tested to be larger than 0 05 the null hypothesis that p d y i x i follows the standard gaussian distribution holds otherwise the null hypothesis is rejected and p d y i x i are tested to not follow the standard gaussian distribution for the two tests the p values are obtained based on their test statistics the kolmogorov smirnov statistic d is given by massey 1951 37 d s u p z c d f n p c d f e p where s u p z represents the supremum of the distance between the cdf of standard gaussian distribution cd f n p and the empirical cdf of samples cd f e p the shapiro wilk test statistic w is given by shapiro wilk 1965 38 w j 1 n a j p j 2 j 1 n p j μ p 2 where n is the sample size p j represents the j th order statistic and ai are coefficients determined by the means and covariances of the order statistics of random samples from the standard gaussian distribution the set of four normality indicators are obtained through computation grid cell by grid cell 39 i τ d ι y x where i τ d represents the set of one normality indicator τ for original or transformed data d and ι y x represents the value specified by latitude y and longitude x 5 results 5 1 optimal transformation parameters the grid based starts in the pre specified ranges are used to search for the optimal transformation parameters for each start the probability of success i e leading to the optimal transformation parameters is illustrated in fig 3 for the three transformations specifically a start is considered to be successful in leading to the global optimal when the search from the start eventually converges to a parameter set of which the relative tolerance of the negative log likelihood function is within 1 of the global optimal kavetski et al 2018 from the three subplots it can be observed that starts with high probability of success tend to be within the pre specified parameter ranges this result suggests that the lower and upper bounds listed in table 2 are reasonable for the transformation of precipitation data box cox 1964 erdin et al 2012 wang et al 2012 cecinati et al 2017 1 for the log transformation fig 3a the probability of success is evidently high when the value of c is smaller than 1 in particular c equal to 2 12 10 2 exhibits the highest probability of success 99 52 on the other hand when c is larger than 1 there is a drop in the probability of success probably due to that a large c results in an affine transformation that is not as effective in dealing with the skewness 2 for the box cox transformation fig 3b the probability of success tends to be high for λ 1 between 1 0 and 1 0 and λ 2 smaller than 1 when λ 1 and λ 2 are respectively 0 04 and 1 68 10 9 the probability of success reaches 98 63 the highest starts of which λ 1 is larger than 1 exhibit evident drop in the probability of success it is possibly due to that a convex transformation hardly works for precipitation data that is generally positively skewed 3 for the log sinh transformation fig 3c there is generally a high probability of success when a is smaller than 1 and b is between 1 and 10 it is the highest 91 91 when a is 9 54 10 2 and b is 1 93 by contrast the probability tends to decline when b tends toward the lower or upper bounds and a toward the upper bound the empirical frequency of the global optimal transformation parameters locating in the pre specified ranges is illustrated in fig 4 that is for the three transformations the frequency of optimal transformation parameters falling into the grid is counted for the tests of gpcc precipitation data across the globe for the log transformation fig 4a the frequency tends to be high when c is at the lower bound 10 10 at the upper bound 102 or close to 10 1 the implications are that 10 10 deals with highly skewed precipitation data that 102 leads to an affine transformation for reasonably normally distributed precipitation data and that 10 1 handles positive skewness of precipitation data for the box cox transformation fig 4b the optimal λ 1 generally varies between 0 and 1 and the optimal λ 2 can vary from 10 6 to 102 or even tend toward 10 10 for the log sinh transformation fig 4c the optimal a can vary from 10 6 to 1 or tend toward 10 10 and the optimal b from 10 2 to 10 overall the wide ranges of the optimal transformation parameters are attributable to the complexity of precipitation data at the global scale 5 2 efficiency of the algorithm the computational efficiency of the newton type algorithm is indicated by the number of objective function evaluations for each start in fig 5 nocedal wright 2006 kavetski et al 2018 comparing fig 5 with fig 3 there are three remarkable findings firstly regions of high probability of success correspond to regions of low computational cost for example from figs 3b and 5b it is observed that for starts with 0 λ 1 1 and λ 2 10 2 the probability of success tends to be higher than 90 and the number of objective function evaluations is generally less than 60 this result points to the importance of good starts in the efficient search of the optimal transformation parameters secondly regions where the probability of success is not as high correspond to regions of reasonable computation cost the implication is that although some starts may be away from the global optimal not that good there is still a chance to reach the global optimal by making some effort thirdly regions of low probability of success can correspond to regions of low computation cost it is particular the case when c tends toward 102 for the log transformation figs 3a and 5a λ 2 toward 102 for the box cox transformation figs 3b and 5b and a toward 10 for the log sinh transformation figs 3c and 5c the implication is that there exist near flat domains in which the algorithm prematurely converges but fails to reach the global optimal kavetski clark 2010 wang et al 2012 bennett et al 2021 the grid based starts are introduced to search for the global optimal in fig 6 the probability of reaching the global optimal is illustrated for different numbers of grid based starts specifically the best transformation parameters determined by 50 grid based starts are considered to be the global optimal and then the relative tolerance of 1 kavetski et al 2018 is set to account for the probability of reaching the global optimal under 3 5 10 and 30 grid based starts for each parameter notably there are 3 5 10 and 30 starts for the log transformation and 3 3 5 5 10 10 and 30 30 for the box cox and log sinh transformations while individual starts may be not satisfactory and can fail to reach the global optimal fig 3 the grid based starts take advantage of regular sampling in the pre specified parameter ranges to evidently increase the probability of success from fig 6 it is observed that with 3 starts for each parameter the probability of reaching the global optimal is respectively 99 58 99 53 and 89 90 for the log box cox and log sinh transformations with 10 starts for each parameter the probability reaches 100 5 3 convergence of the algorithm the converge curves which plot the value of objective function against the number of iterations are illustrated for grid based starts under the three transformations in figs 7 8 and 9 in fig 7 the attention is paid to three case study locations three rows to showcase the convergence as the number of grid based starts increases from 3 to 5 to 10 to 30 and to 50 five columns the blue and brown curves are respectively for starts leading to and not leading to the global optimal for the three locations it can be observed that the convergence to the global optimal is usually achieved in about 20 iterations in the meantime it is noted that not all starts eventually lead to the global optimal in other words some starts can be subject to possible entrapments in local optimal this result is in accordance with fig 3 indicating that the probability of success varies across the parameter ranges in fig 8 the convergence curves are presented for the box cox transformation as there are two parameters for the box cox transformation the curves are for 3 3 5 5 10 10 30 30 and 50 50 grid based starts it can be observed that the objective function at the starts 0th iteration exhibits a wide variation range possibly owing to that the box cox transformation can be either convex or concave in the meantime more iterations are in demand to achieve the convergence to the global optimal it can be observed that the blue curves that lead to the global optimal generally incur less iterations than the brown curves that do not the implications are that good starts can lead to fast convergence to the global optimal and that poor starts can be trapped by the local optimal even after numerous iterations in fig 9 the convergence curves are illustrated for the log sinh transformation since there are two parameters the curves are for 3 3 5 5 10 10 30 30 and 50 50 grid based starts similar to figs 7 and 8 it is observed that some starts lead to the convergence to the global optimal blue curves and that some starts do not brown curves this result indicates that the multi start strategy can take advantage of the probabilities of success at individual starts to augment the overall probability of reaching the global optimal for the blue curves the number of iterations is generally less than 50 this result indicates the computational efficiency for the log sinh transformation 5 4 normalization of precipitation data the normality of the original precipitation data is examined in fig 10 from figs 10a and 10b it can be observed that in large parts of asia and north america there tend to be low skewness and kurtosis coefficients suggesting that therein precipitation data can be reasonably normally distributed at the monthly timescale meanwhile there are remarkably positive skewness and kurtosis coefficients in some other regions such as western north america southern africa and northern australia possibly due to the prevalence of zero values and the existence of extreme values stagge et al 2015 papalexiou 2022 in figs 10c and 10d it can be seen that the p values of the kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk tests are generally low for regions with high skewness and kurtosis coefficients this result is possibly owing to heavy tails on the right hand side resulting in departures of z scores from the standard gaussian distribution therefore there is a need of data transformation to normalize skewed and censored precipitation data wang et al 2010 erdin et al 2012 cecinati et al 2017 the four normality indicators for the transformed precipitation data generated by the log box cox and log sinh transformations are presented in fig 11 specifically 10 grid based starts are applied to each transformation parameter so as to obtain the global optimal parameters to implement the three transformations figs 6 to 9 comparing fig 11 with fig 10 it is found that at the global scale the three transformations evidently result in the decrease of skewness and kurtosis coefficients the first two rows and the increase of the p values of the kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk tests the last two rows this outcome indicates the effectiveness of the three transformations in reducing the skewness and kurtosis and improving the normality in the meantime it is noted that in central africa there exist some regions with relatively high skewness and kurtosis coefficients and low p values of the two tests therein zero precipitation is prevalent and precipitation data can be produced by the climatological infilling method for regions where few gauge stations exist schneider et al 2020 leading to a few unique samples as a result data transformation and normality tests are impacted adding to the spatial plots in figs 10 and 11 boxplots are produced by pooling the normality indicators around the world to compare the normality for original and transformed precipitation data in fig 12 in addition the skewness and kurtosis coefficients are calculated for 1 000 sets of random standard gaussian samples in order to derive the corresponding 2 5 97 5 uncertainty intervals that serve as the references in other words the skewness and kurtosis coefficients tend to fall within the uncertainty intervals when data follow the standard gaussian distribution for the two tests the p values greater than the significance level of 0 05 indicate the normality of data from figs 12a and 12b it can be observed that the skewness and kurtosis coefficients of the transformed data which are generally within the uncertainty intervals are evidently lower than those of the original data from figs 12c and 12d it can be seen that although the popular kolmogorov smirnov test suggests that monthly precipitation data could be normal the shapiro wilk test indicates the generally non gaussian distribution the different outcomes can be due to that the kolmogorov smirnov test require large sample sizes usually more than 100 to facilitate a robust result and that the shapiro wilk test exhibits better power in detecting the departures from the normality in cases with small sample sizes razali et al 2011 nevertheless as shown by the p values under both kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk tests the three transformations are effective in improving the normality of precipitation data 6 discussion this paper has furthermore devised experiments to compare the proposed newton type method with the classical nelder mead method barati 2011 gao han 2012 durgut ayvaz 2023 specifically the case studies in figs 7 to 9 are performed to test the convergence of the nelder mead method the convergence curves for the log box cox and log sinh transformations are presented in the supplementary material in figures s1 to s3 the brown lines in general indicate that the nelder mead method tends to be trapped by local optimal although the global optimal can be reached under some starts more iterations are in demand for example the case of the log sinh transformation shows that the number of iterations can be more than 400 for the nelder mead method figure s3 but mostly less than 100 for the newton type method fig 9 in the meantime the slopes of the curves imply that the nelder mead method usually exhibits a slower rate of reduction for the negative likelihood function this result suggests that the nelder mead method tends to exhibit a slower rate of convergence than the newton type method does it is possibly owing to the fact that the gradient vector and hessian matrix are considered in the proposed newton type method to facilitate the search of global optimal the robustness and efficiency are two of the most important properties of an algorithm nocedal wright 2006 kavetski et al 2018 specifically the robustness indicates the ability to find the global optimal on a wide variety of conditions while the efficiency indicates that there is no need for excessive computational cost nocedal wright 2006 the family of gradient based optimizers to which the newton type method belongs has previously been used for parameter estimation in hydrological and environmental modeling doherty 2003 arnold et al 2012 qin et al 2018 in this paper the newton type method determines the searching direction in each iteration by using the analytical form of gradient vectors derived from the likelihood functions eqs 27 and 28 in this way the newton type method exploits the curvature information for fast convergence rate and reduced computational cost while the newton type method is inevitably subject to local optimal grid based starts devised in the algorithm are effective in facilitating the convergence to the global optimal tolson shoemaker 2007 kavetski clark 2010 furthermore from figs 6 to 9 10 grid based starts for each parameter are shown to be both robust and efficient in leading to the global optimal transformation parameters there are wide uses of the log box cox and log sinh transformations for the normalization of hydroclimatic variables including precipitation and streamflow erdin et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 woldemeskel et al 2018 mcinerney et al 2019 jiang et al 2021 the newton type algorithm proposed in this paper facilitates the comprehensive implementation of the three transformations for data normalization figs 10 to 12 it is noted that the gaussian distribution is an integral component of popular models including bayesian model averaging kriging methods and autoregressive model ma et al 2018 pulkkinen et al 2019 bunn et al 2022 in this case the three transformations implemented by the proposed algorithm can serve for the purpose of data normalization which allows the use of these well established models based on the gaussian distribution for precipitation data specifically statistical models can be formulated for the transformed precipitation data that follow the gaussian distribution and the outcomes are then back transformed into the original space of precipitation wang et al 2009 zhang ye 2021 furthermore the improvement of normality can contribute to reducing the errors caused by possible departures from the gaussian distribution erdin et al 2012 cecinati et al 2017 7 conclusions this paper has proposed a newton type algorithm for the comprehensive implementation of the log box cox and log sinh transformations focusing on the skewness and censoring characteristics of precipitation data the likelihood functions are formulated by relating the z score to the jacobian determinant and then the gradient vectors are analytically derived from the likelihood functions under the three transformations numerical experiments of the gpcc monthly precipitation data are devised to yield diagnostic insights into the efficiency and convergence of the algorithm and investigate its usefulness in data normalization overall the results show that the three transformations are effectively implemented specifically the log transformation robustly reduces positive skewness by using a relatively simple offset parameter the box cox transformation has a flexible form for data normalization but incurs slightly high computational costs to find the global optimal and the log sinh transformation is computational efficient in normalizing precipitation data for the three transformations multiple starts are in demand to deal with local optimal and to reach the global optimal specifically 10 grid based starts for each parameter are shown to be sufficient for the algorithm to find the global optimal overall the three transformations implemented by the newton type algorithm is demonstrated to substantially improve the normality of precipitation data across the world in the future the newton type algorithm can be applied to handle precipitation data at different spatiotemporal scales and in the meantime its robustness and efficiency can be tested 8 plain language summary precipitation is one of the most important hydroclimatic variables that have widespread socioeconomic impacts real world precipitation data usually have a large proportion of small values and a small proportion of extreme values i e skewness and furthermore they have a lower bound at zero i e censoring in hydrological applications the log box cox and log sinh transformations have been widely used for the normalization of precipitation data focusing on the characteristics of skewness and censoring this paper has developed a novel newton type algorithm for the comprehensive implementation of the three transformations specifically the algorithm is developed by formulating the likelihood functions under the three transformations by deriving the gradient vectors to determine the searching directions and by devising grid based starts to facilitate the convergence to the global optimal a test is conducted for precipitation data provided by the global precipitation climatology centre the results show that although precipitation data exhibit varying skewness and censoring characteristics across the globe the three transformations implemented by the newton type algorithm are effective in reducing the skewness handling the censoring and improving the normality overall the newton type algorithm can serve as

1999,the log box cox and log sinh transformations have been widely used for the purpose of data normalization in hydrological applications focusing on the skewness and censoring characteristics of precipitation data this paper has developed a novel newton type algorithm for the comprehensive implementation of the three transformations specifically the likelihood functions are formulated by using the classic z score and the jacobian determinants of the three transformations the gradient vectors are analytically derived to determine the searching directions and grid based starts are devised to facilitate the convergence to the global optimal to test the effectiveness of the algorithm numerical experiments are devised for monthly precipitation data from the global precipitation climatology centre the results show that the log transformation reduces the positive skewness by using a simple offset parameter the box cox transformation is flexible for data normalization and incurs slightly high computational costs more than 80 function evaluations and the log sinh transformation is computational efficient in normalizing precipitation data less than 40 function evaluations for the three transformations multiple starts are in demand to handle local optimal and 10 grid based starts for each parameter are shown to be sufficient for the algorithm to reach the global optimal after transformation skewness and kurtosis coefficients are reduced to nearly 0 in most regions and the kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk tests suggest that transformed data follow gaussian distribution at the significance level of 0 05 overall the newton type algorithm can serve to implement the log box cox and log sinh transformations for effective hydrological modelling and

variables with profound socioeconomic impacts barnett et al 2005 kidd huffman 2011 kotz et al 2022 in practice precipitation is observed by rain gauges at the local scale and is also inferred from weather radars and remote sensing satellites at regional and global scales kidd huffman 2011 skofronick jackson et al 2017 sun et al 2018 in the meantime climate models and assimilation techniques are developed to integrate precipitation measurements from multiple sources to generate gridded precipitation datasets becker et al 2013 beck et al 2019 these quantitative observations lay the basis for the modeling of precipitation to facilitate the understanding of hydroclimatic processes and inform water resources management gong et al 2020 shrestha et al 2020 also statistical models based on the long term records of precipitation serve as important tools to estimate the probabilities of extreme precipitation and meteorological droughts for disaster planning marra et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b the probability distribution of precipitation data has long been a topic of interest for the modeling of precipitation papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 ye et al 2018 martinez villalobos neelin 2019 the skewness and censoring are two of the most important characteristics stagge et al 2015 papalexiou koutsoyiannis 2016 specifically skewness refers to the extent of asymmetry of probability distributions precipitation data tend to exhibit positive skewness since there are a large proportion of small values and also some extreme values ye et al 2018 martinez villalobos neelin 2019 the censoring indicates that the observed values of precipitation cannot be smaller than zero as precipitation is an intermittent process of wet and dry spells papalexiou 2022 on the other hand there is an underlying assumption of gaussian distribution for popular statistical models used in hydrology such as the triple collocation method for data merging li et al 2018 chen et al 2022 and the autoregressive model for time series analysis alaya et al 2015 mehdizadeh et al 2017 overall the skewness and censoring characteristics are challenging for statistical modeling of precipitation wang et al 2010 cecinati et al 2017 mcinerney et al 2019 data transformation has been widely used for the purpose of data normalization to enable effective statistical modeling box cox 1964 yeo johnson 2000 wang et al 2012 there exist three popular transformations i e the log transformation johnson 1949 keene 1995 the box cox transformation box cox 1964 and the log sinh transformation wang et al 2012 the log transformation which has an offset parameter employs the natural logarithm function to reduce the positive skewness of hydrological data lopez 2011 lien et al 2016 li et al 2018 the box cox transformation which has a power parameter and an offset parameter presents a family of power transformations for the normalization of hydrological data bates campbell 2001 erdin et al 2012 del giudice et al 2013 the log sinh transformation which has an intercept parameter and a slope parameter deals with the heteroscedasticity of hydrological data robertson et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 schepen et al 2018 these three transformations have been extensively used in streamflow forecasting wang et al 2012 mcinerney et al 2017 drought monitoring vasiliades loukas 2009 angelidis et al 2012 and quantitative precipitation estimation erdin et al 2012 chen et al 2022 the transformation parameters play a critical part in data normalization under the log box cox and log sinh transformations thyer et al 2002 erdin et al 2012 cecinati et al 2017 for the sake of simplicity the transformation parameters can be fixed by using some empirical values mcinerney et al 2018 wu et al 2019 li et al 2021 for example in streamflow forecasting the power parameter of the box cox transformation can be fixed to 0 2 0 35 or 0 5 and the offset parameter can be set to a constant slightly larger than zero bates campbell 2001 del giudice et al 2013 mcinerney et al 2017 nevertheless the skewness and censoring characteristics vary by region and by season which can diminish the effectiveness of fixed parameters wang et al 2010 erdin et al 2012 cecinati et al 2017 in addition the censoring characteristic i e the lower bound limits the applicability of parameters estimated in humid and sub humid regions to semi arid and arid regions wang robertson 2011 mcinerney et al 2019 huang et al 2022 therefore efforts have been devoted to effective implementations of the log box cox and log sinh transformations by developing numerical algorithms for parameter estimation box cox 1964 thyer et al 2002 wang et al 2012 and also by large sample crash testing erdin et al 2012 mcinerney et al 2017 berthet et al 2020 focusing on the skewness and censoring characteristics of precipitation data this paper proposes a novel newton type algorithm for the comprehensive implementation of the log box cox and log sinh transformations specifically the likelihood functions are formulated by using the classic z score and the jacobian determinants of the three transformations the gradient vectors are analytically derived to determine the searching directions doherty 2003 nocedal and wright 2006 arnold et al 2012 and furthermore grid based starts are devised to facilitate the convergence to the global optimal skahill doherty 2006 tolson shoemaker 2007 kavetski et al 2018 to test the effectiveness of the newton type algorithm numerical experiments are devised to implement the log box cox and log sinh transformations for the precipitation data from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc s full data monthly product as will be demonstrated through the results the algorithm yields diagnostic insights into the efficiency and convergence of the transformations while monthly precipitation data generally do not follow the gaussian distribution the log box cox and log sinh transformations implemented by the newton type algorithm are effective in improving the normality 2 data transformations 2 1 log transformation the log transformation is based on the natural logarithm function johnson 1949 keene 1995 1 y log x log x c where x represents original precipitation data and c is the offset parameter that is positive to make the log transformation available for zero values lien et al 2016 berthet et al 2020 the parameter c can be scaled to the dimensionless c mcinerney et al 2018 woldemeskel et al 2018 2 c c x max where x max represents the maximum value of precipitation data in this way the c is independent of the magnitude of precipitation data from eq 1 the first and second order derivatives are derived 3 y log x x c 1 y log x x c 2 the first and second order derivatives are respectively positive and negative indicating that the log transformation is monotonically increasing and concave overall the log transformation can reduce the positive skewness of precipitation data because it tends to compress large values and in the meantime extend small values van zwet 1964 yeo johnson 2000 the effect of transformation tends to reduce as the value of c increases 4 y log x x c log c for c x in particular when c is much greater than x the log transformation is equivalent to an affine transformation that has little effect on skewness 2 2 box cox transformation the box cox transformation is developed by modifying the classic power transformations to handle the discontinuity when the power parameter is zero tukey 1957 box cox 1964 sakia 1992 5 y box cox x x λ 2 λ 1 1 λ 1 if λ 1 0 log x λ 2 if λ 1 0 where λ 1 and λ 2 are respectively the power and offset parameters when the value of λ 1 is 0 5 0 and 1 the box cox transformation is respectively equivalent to the classic square root log and reciprocal transformations the value of λ 2 is positive and it can be scaled by x max mcinerney et al 2018 6 λ 2 λ 2 x max where λ 2 is the dimensionless form of λ 2 the first and second order derivatives under the box cox transformation are 7 y box cox x x λ 2 λ 1 1 y box cox x λ 1 1 x λ 2 λ 1 2 the first order derivative in eq 7 is positive indicating that the box cox transformation is monotonically increasing by contrast the sign of the second order derivative depends on the value of λ 1 specifically y box cox x becomes positive or negative when the value of λ 1 is larger or smaller than one the indication is that the box cox transformation can be either concave or convex therefore the box cox transformation with λ 1 less than 1 or λ 1 greater than 1 can reduce or increase the skewness of precipitation data van zwet 1964 yeo johnson 2000 2 3 log sinh transformation the log sinh transformation combines the natural logarithm function with the hyperbolic sine function wang et al 2012 robertson et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 8 y log sinh x 1 b log sinh a b x where a and b are respectively the intercept and slope parameters for the hyperbolic sine function the two parameters are positive and b can be scaled by x max li et al 2013 berthet et al 2020 bennett et al 2021 9 b b x max where b is the dimensionless form of b the first and second order derivatives under the log sinh transformation are 10 y log sinh x coth a b x y log sinh x b csch 2 a b x where coth and csch are respectively hyperbolic cotangent and cosecant functions from eq 10 the positive first order derivative indicates that the log sinh transformation is monotonically increasing and the negative second order derivative suggests that this transformation is concave a and b respectively control the lower and upper references of the transformation wang et al 2012 del giudice et al 2013 wu et al 2019 for the log sinh transformation it is noted that 11 y log sinh x 1 b l o g a b x f o r a b x 0 y log sinh x x a b l o g 2 b f o r a b x 3 as can be seen the log sinh transformation tends to be the log transformation when the values of a and b are small and it becomes similar to the affine transformation for large values of a and b berthet et al 2020 2 4 an illustrative example an illustrative example is presented in fig 1 to showcase the three popular transformations in fig 1a to 1c the transformed precipitation data are plotted against the original precipitation data yeo johnson 2000 it can be seen that the three monotonically increasing transformations preserve the order of original precipitation data and that the relationships between original and transformed precipitation data depend on the transformation parameters 1 for the log transformation fig 1a the points tend to align along a straight line as c increases indicating a reduced effect on skewness 2 for the box cox transformation fig 1b the plot is concave under λ 1 0 5 and becomes convex when λ 1 1 5 3 for the log sinh transformation fig 1c the increases of a and b respectively reduce the effect of the transformation on small and large values the normal probability plots in fig 1d to 1f compare the z scores of original and transformed precipitation data against standard gaussian variates if the points align along the 1 1 line then the z scores are shown to follow the standard gaussian distribution on the other hand if the points at both sides tend to bend above or below the 1 1 line then the z scores tend to exhibit positive or negative skewness buuren and fredriks 2001 as is indicated by the black diamonds the original precipitation data are evidently positively skewed in the meantime it can be observed that the characteristic of skewness varies under different sets of transformation parameters this result points to the critical part that the transformation parameters play in determining the statistical properties of transformed precipitation data box cox 1964 yeo johnson 2000 wang et al 2012 3 newton type algorithm 3 1 overview of the algorithm this paper proposes a newton type algorithm for the comprehensive implementation of the log box cox and log sinh transformations as shown in fig 2 the algorithm is composed of five steps 1 the likelihood function is derived from the classic z score and the jacobian determinant to account for the skewness and censoring characteristics of precipitation data 2 the analytical expressions of gradients vectors are derived from the formulated likelihood functions under the three transformation 3 the grid based starts are devised in the multi start strategy to facilitate the convergence to the global optimal 4 the optimal transformation parameters are estimated by using the likelihood functions gradient vectors and multi start strategy and 5 the skewed and censored precipitation data are transformed by the log box cox and log sinh transformations 3 2 formulation of likelihood functions the likelihood function to characterize the joint probability of skewed and censored precipitation data x x 1 x 2 x n is formulated 12 l θ x i ω 1 pd f x x i i ω 0 cd f x x 0 where l θ x represents the likelihood function under the parameter set θ for the given precipitation data x x 0 represents the censoring threshold to determine uncensored xi x 0 versus censored precipitation data xi x 0 ω1 ω0 represents the sub set of uncensored censored data in x and pd f x and cd f x respectively represent the probability density function pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf for x for uncensored data pd f x in eq 12 is derived from the pdf of z scores which are assumed to follow the standard gaussian distribution under the three transformations and the jacobian determinant of transformation box cox 1964 wang et al 2012 13 pd f x x i y x i 1 σ y 2 π e 1 2 y x i μ y σ y 2 where y x i represents the transformed value of xi y x i is the first order derivative in the jacobian determinant of transformation and μ y and σ y are respectively the parameters of mean and standard deviation for transformed data y as can be seen pd f x accounts for the skewness characteristic of precipitation data by combining the z score and jacobian determinant for censored data cd f x in eq 12 is expressed by the cdf for the z score of transformed x 0 14 cd f x x 0 1 2 1 e r f y x 0 μ y σ y 2 where y x 0 represents the transformed value of x 0 and e r f u 2 π 0 u e t 2 d t is the error function specifically the precise values of censored data which are known to be less than or equal to x 0 are not available wang robertson 2011 mcinerney et al 2019 huang et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 therefore for all the censored data cd f x x 0 is introduced to account for the lumped probability mass at x 0 allowing for the consideration of the censoring characteristic of precipitation data for the three transformations the log likelihood functions are detailed by specifying the jacobian determinant 1 for the log transformation 15 log l log θ x i ω 1 y x i n 1 log σ y 2 σ y 2 1 i ω 1 y x i μ

they are determined by the classic maximum log likelihood estimation thyer et al 2002 erdin et al 2012 cecinati et al 2017 3 3 derivation of gradient vectors the gradient vectors of the log likelihood functions are composed of the first order partial derivatives with respect to the parameters in θ 1 for the log transformation the gradient vector is 18 log l log θ x log l log θ x c log l log θ x μ y

expressions of the gradient vectors costly finite difference operations are no longer in demand 3 4 design of multi start strategy the multi start strategy makes use of the regular gridded sampling skahill doherty 2006 tolson shoemaker 2007 kavetski clark 2010 specifically the range of each parameter is uniformly discretized to generate multiple regularly spaced points 24 θ l θ l δ θ u θ l m 1 θ u for δ 1 2 m 2 where θ l and θ u respectively represent the lower and upper bounds of the parameter range and m represents the pre specified number of regular points in this way all possible combinations of regular points for different parameters determine multiple grid points that are uniformly distributed in the parameter space these grid points represent initial estimates of θ and are used as the grid based starts 25 θ 0 1 θ 0 2 θ 0 m where m represents the number of grid based starts it is noted that the multiple grid based starts are meant to prevent the entrapments in local optimal and facilitate the convergence to the global optimal 3 5 estimation of transformation parameters the minimization of the negative number of log likelihood functions which is equivalent to the maximization of the likelihood functions is performed in order to estimate θ 26 θ e arg min θ log l θ x θ l θ θ u where θ e represents the set of estimated parameters and θ l and θ u are respectively the sets of lower and upper bounds the newton type methods begin with a grid based start and find θ e through iterative computations nocedal wright 2006 27 θ k 1 θ k h k 1 g k where θ k is the parameter set in the k th iteration and h k 1 and g k are respectively the inverse hessian matrix and gradient vector evaluated by θ k the multi start strategy allows the newton type methods to begin with a number of pre defined grid based starts eq 25 which preserves the deterministic performance of the algorithm the gradient vector and the inverse hessian matrix are updated in every iteration specifically g k is calculated for the negative log likelihood functions 28 g k log l θ k x where log l θ k x represents the gradient vectors for the three transformations it is noted that the popular broyden fletcher goldfard shano bfgs method is employed to update the approximation of the hessian matrix in each iteration byrd et al 1995 zhu et al 1997 the optimal parameter set θ opt is selected from all the estimated parameter sets obtained under the multi start strategy 29 θ opt argmin θ e log l θ e d x f o r d 1 2 m where θ e d represents the set of estimated parameters under the d th start given a set of precipitation data and a transformation θ opt is selected as the optimal parameter set that minimizes the negative number of the log likelihood function 3 6 transformation of precipitation data precipitation data are transformed by θ opt and then converted into z scores vasiliades loukas 2009 angelidis et al 2012 30 z x i y x i μ y σ y where z x i is the z score corresponding to the transformed value y x i and μ y and σ y are respectively the parameters of mean and standard deviation in θ opt for censored data the corresponding z scores do not have precise values thus the pseudo z scores zc are generated 31 z c n 0 1 2 f o r z c z 0 where z 0 is the z score of y x 0 specifically the pseudo z scores zc are randomly sampled from the standard gaussian distribution in the range of zc z 0 overall through the newton type algorithm the skewed and censored precipitation data are transformed to follow the standard gaussian distribution 4 numerical experiments 4 1 precipitation dataset numerical experiments of the gpcc monthly precipitation are devised to test the effectiveness of the proposed newton type algorithm the gpcc integrates a large number of gauge based observations from different sources and produces the gridded precipitation dataset by interpolation methods becker et al 2013 schneider et al 2020 the monthly precipitation data from 1970 to 2019 at the spatial resolution of 1 is obtained from the gpcc full data monthly product version 2020 it has three dimensions 32 p p t y x where p represents the gpcc precipitation dataset and p represents observed value specified by time t latitude y and longitude x specifically t is the number of hours since the beginning of january 1891 representing the month of precipitation observations y ranges from 89 5 89 5 n to 89 5 89 5 s and x is from 179 5 179 5 w to 179 5 179 5 e herein the monthly precipitation data for july are retrieved for data transformation to account for the seasonality of precipitation in the gpcc dataset it is noted that there can be mostly censored values in arid regions in addition missing values in regions without any gauge stations are filled with the long term average which can lead to a number of duplicated values schneider et al 2020 in both cases the small size of unique samples affects the effectiveness of parameter estimation and normality tests razali et al 2011 carbone et al 2018 therefore the attention is paid to land grid cells with at least ten unique uncensored data the newton type algorithm is implemented to transform precipitation data for each grid cell under investigation that is precipitation data is extracted from p by specifying the month latitude and longitude 33 p july y i x i p j where j is the year in the period from 1970 to 2019 a censoring threshold of 0 01 mm is used in the formulation of the likelihood function eq 12 the threshold is set to be slightly larger than zero to account for the minimum measurable precipitation amount robertson et al 2013 schepen et al 2018 huang et al 2022 4 2 settings of the algorithm the ranges of transformation parameters in the algorithm implementations of the log box cox and log sinh transformations are listed in table 2 the ranges of c λ 2 and b are defined by dimensionless c eq 2 λ 2 eq 6 and b eq 9 which facilitates inter comparisons at the global scale mcinerney et al 2018 berthet et al 2020 the lower and upper bounds are determined by following the parameter ranges previously used for the transformation of hydrological data box cox 1964 wang et al 2012 lien et al 2016 mcinerney et al 2017 berthet et al 2020 specifically the lower bounds close to zero are set for the transformation parameters except for λ 1 that are defined to be positive box cox 1964 wang et al 2012 also the high upper bounds lead to relatively wide parameter ranges which allows the newton type algorithm to find the optimal transformation parameters for various precipitation data in humid and arid regions for λ 1 the value ranges from 2 to 2 so that the box cox transformation can be either concave or convex the grid based starts are set under the pre specified ranges of parameters specifically λ 1 is sampled at the linear scale while the other transformation parameters are sampled at the logarithmic scale the logarithmic scale is meant to deal with transformation parameters that vary across several orders of magnitude wang et al 2012 berthet et al 2020 the initial estimates of μy and σy depend on the values of transformation parameters and precipitation samples that is given the initial estimates of transformation parameters the mean and standard deviation of transformed samples are used as the initial estimates of μy and σy in this way multiple grid based starts are generated by considering the dependence of the mean μy and the standard deviation σy on the magnitude of precipitation data and transformation parameters thyer et al 2002 five numbers of grid based starts for each transformation parameter are investigated in numerical experiments that is the range of each parameter is discretized into 3 5 10 30 and 50 regular points eq 24 for the log transformation the regular points of c are used as grid based starts for the box cox and log sinh transformations there are 3 3 9 5 5 25 10 10 100 30 30 900 and 50 50 2500 grid based starts it is noted that the density of gridding is reasonably high when 50 grid based starts are used for each parameter as a result the corresponding optimal parameter set is considered to be the global optimal 4 3 normality indicators the skewness coefficient kurtosis coefficient and the p values of one sample kolmogorov smirnov test and shapiro wilk test are used to assess the extent to which the z scores of original and transformed precipitation data follow the standard gaussian distribution razali et al 2011 mcinerney et al 2017 svensson et al 2017 laimighofer laaha 2022 the four normality indicators are independently calculated in each grid cell under investigation 34 p d y i x i p j where p d y i x i represents the set of the z scores p j of original or transformed data d for a specified grid cell i the skewness coefficient cs indicates the positive negative skewness 35 c s e p d y i x i μ p 3 e p d y i x i μ p 2 3 2 the kurtosis coefficient ck measures the heavy light tail 36 c k e p d y i x i μ p 4 e p d y i x i μ p 2 2 3 where e represents the expectation operator and μp is the mean of p d y i x i cs and ck which are descriptive tend toward zero for the standard gaussian distribution for precipitation data it is noted that positive cs and ck which indicate a heavy tail on the right side of the probability distribution are usually observed papalexiou et al 2013 ye et al 2018 martinez villalobos neelin 2019 the p values for the one sample kolmogorov smirnov test and the shapiro wilk test are calculated for comparison with the significance level of 0 05 when the p values are tested to be larger than 0 05 the null hypothesis that p d y i x i follows the standard gaussian distribution holds otherwise the null hypothesis is rejected and p d y i x i are tested to not follow the standard gaussian distribution for the two tests the p values are obtained based on their test statistics the kolmogorov smirnov statistic d is given by massey 1951 37 d s u p z c d f n p c d f e p where s u p z represents the supremum of the distance between the cdf of standard gaussian distribution cd f n p and the empirical cdf of samples cd f e p the shapiro wilk test statistic w is given by shapiro wilk 1965 38 w j 1 n a j p j 2 j 1 n p j μ p 2 where n is the sample size p j represents the j th order statistic and ai are coefficients determined by the means and covariances of the order statistics of random samples from the standard gaussian distribution the set of four normality indicators are obtained through computation grid cell by grid cell 39 i τ d ι y x where i τ d represents the set of one normality indicator τ for original or transformed data d and ι y x represents the value specified by latitude y and longitude x 5 results 5 1 optimal transformation parameters the grid based starts in the pre specified ranges are used to search for the optimal transformation parameters for each start the probability of success i e leading to the optimal transformation parameters is illustrated in fig 3 for the three transformations specifically a start is considered to be successful in leading to the global optimal when the search from the start eventually converges to a parameter set of which the relative tolerance of the negative log likelihood function is within 1 of the global optimal kavetski et al 2018 from the three subplots it can be observed that starts with high probability of success tend to be within the pre specified parameter ranges this result suggests that the lower and upper bounds listed in table 2 are reasonable for the transformation of precipitation data box cox 1964 erdin et al 2012 wang et al 2012 cecinati et al 2017 1 for the log transformation fig 3a the probability of success is evidently high when the value of c is smaller than 1 in particular c equal to 2 12 10 2 exhibits the highest probability of success 99 52 on the other hand when c is larger than 1 there is a drop in the probability of success probably due to that a large c results in an affine transformation that is not as effective in dealing with the skewness 2 for the box cox transformation fig 3b the probability of success tends to be high for λ 1 between 1 0 and 1 0 and λ 2 smaller than 1 when λ 1 and λ 2 are respectively 0 04 and 1 68 10 9 the probability of success reaches 98 63 the highest starts of which λ 1 is larger than 1 exhibit evident drop in the probability of success it is possibly due to that a convex transformation hardly works for precipitation data that is generally positively skewed 3 for the log sinh transformation fig 3c there is generally a high probability of success when a is smaller than 1 and b is between 1 and 10 it is the highest 91 91 when a is 9 54 10 2 and b is 1 93 by contrast the probability tends to decline when b tends toward the lower or upper bounds and a toward the upper bound the empirical frequency of the global optimal transformation parameters locating in the pre specified ranges is illustrated in fig 4 that is for the three transformations the frequency of optimal transformation parameters falling into the grid is counted for the tests of gpcc precipitation data across the globe for the log transformation fig 4a the frequency tends to be high when c is at the lower bound 10 10 at the upper bound 102 or close to 10 1 the implications are that 10 10 deals with highly skewed precipitation data that 102 leads to an affine transformation for reasonably normally distributed precipitation data and that 10 1 handles positive skewness of precipitation data for the box cox transformation fig 4b the optimal λ 1 generally varies between 0 and 1 and the optimal λ 2 can vary from 10 6 to 102 or even tend toward 10 10 for the log sinh transformation fig 4c the optimal a can vary from 10 6 to 1 or tend toward 10 10 and the optimal b from 10 2 to 10 overall the wide ranges of the optimal transformation parameters are attributable to the complexity of precipitation data at the global scale 5 2 efficiency of the algorithm the computational efficiency of the newton type algorithm is indicated by the number of objective function evaluations for each start in fig 5 nocedal wright 2006 kavetski et al 2018 comparing fig 5 with fig 3 there are three remarkable findings firstly regions of high probability of success correspond to regions of low computational cost for example from figs 3b and 5b it is observed that for starts with 0 λ 1 1 and λ 2 10 2 the probability of success tends to be higher than 90 and the number of objective function evaluations is generally less than 60 this result points to the importance of good starts in the efficient search of the optimal transformation parameters secondly regions where the probability of success is not as high correspond to regions of reasonable computation cost the implication is that although some starts may be away from the global optimal not that good there is still a chance to reach the global optimal by making some effort thirdly regions of low probability of success can correspond to regions of low computation cost it is particular the case when c tends toward 102 for the log transformation figs 3a and 5a λ 2 toward 102 for the box cox transformation figs 3b and 5b and a toward 10 for the log sinh transformation figs 3c and 5c the implication is that there exist near flat domains in which the algorithm prematurely converges but fails to reach the global optimal kavetski clark 2010 wang et al 2012 bennett et al 2021 the grid based starts are introduced to search for the global optimal in fig 6 the probability of reaching the global optimal is illustrated for different numbers of grid based starts specifically the best transformation parameters determined by 50 grid based starts are considered to be the global optimal and then the relative tolerance of 1 kavetski et al 2018 is set to account for the probability of reaching the global optimal under 3 5 10 and 30 grid based starts for each parameter notably there are 3 5 10 and 30 starts for the log transformation and 3 3 5 5 10 10 and 30 30 for the box cox and log sinh transformations while individual starts may be not satisfactory and can fail to reach the global optimal fig 3 the grid based starts take advantage of regular sampling in the pre specified parameter ranges to evidently increase the probability of success from fig 6 it is observed that with 3 starts for each parameter the probability of reaching the global optimal is respectively 99 58 99 53 and 89 90 for the log box cox and log sinh transformations with 10 starts for each parameter the probability reaches 100 5 3 convergence of the algorithm the converge curves which plot the value of objective function against the number of iterations are illustrated for grid based starts under the three transformations in figs 7 8 and 9 in fig 7 the attention is paid to three case study locations three rows to showcase the convergence as the number of grid based starts increases from 3 to 5 to 10 to 30 and to 50 five columns the blue and brown curves are respectively for starts leading to and not leading to the global optimal for the three locations it can be observed that the convergence to the global optimal is usually achieved in about 20 iterations in the meantime it is noted that not all starts eventually lead to the global optimal in other words some starts can be subject to possible entrapments in local optimal this result is in accordance with fig 3 indicating that the probability of success varies across the parameter ranges in fig 8 the convergence curves are presented for the box cox transformation as there are two parameters for the box cox transformation the curves are for 3 3 5 5 10 10 30 30 and 50 50 grid based starts it can be observed that the objective function at the starts 0th iteration exhibits a wide variation range possibly owing to that the box cox transformation can be either convex or concave in the meantime more iterations are in demand to achieve the convergence to the global optimal it can be observed that the blue curves that lead to the global optimal generally incur less iterations than the brown curves that do not the implications are that good starts can lead to fast convergence to the global optimal and that poor starts can be trapped by the local optimal even after numerous iterations in fig 9 the convergence curves are illustrated for the log sinh transformation since there are two parameters the curves are for 3 3 5 5 10 10 30 30 and 50 50 grid based starts similar to figs 7 and 8 it is observed that some starts lead to the convergence to the global optimal blue curves and that some starts do not brown curves this result indicates that the multi start strategy can take advantage of the probabilities of success at individual starts to augment the overall probability of reaching the global optimal for the blue curves the number of iterations is generally less than 50 this result indicates the computational efficiency for the log sinh transformation 5 4 normalization of precipitation data the normality of the original precipitation data is examined in fig 10 from figs 10a and 10b it can be observed that in large parts of asia and north america there tend to be low skewness and kurtosis coefficients suggesting that therein precipitation data can be reasonably normally distributed at the monthly timescale meanwhile there are remarkably positive skewness and kurtosis coefficients in some other regions such as western north america southern africa and northern australia possibly due to the prevalence of zero values and the existence of extreme values stagge et al 2015 papalexiou 2022 in figs 10c and 10d it can be seen that the p values of the kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk tests are generally low for regions with high skewness and kurtosis coefficients this result is possibly owing to heavy tails on the right hand side resulting in departures of z scores from the standard gaussian distribution therefore there is a need of data transformation to normalize skewed and censored precipitation data wang et al 2010 erdin et al 2012 cecinati et al 2017 the four normality indicators for the transformed precipitation data generated by the log box cox and log sinh transformations are presented in fig 11 specifically 10 grid based starts are applied to each transformation parameter so as to obtain the global optimal parameters to implement the three transformations figs 6 to 9 comparing fig 11 with fig 10 it is found that at the global scale the three transformations evidently result in the decrease of skewness and kurtosis coefficients the first two rows and the increase of the p values of the kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk tests the last two rows this outcome indicates the effectiveness of the three transformations in reducing the skewness and kurtosis and improving the normality in the meantime it is noted that in central africa there exist some regions with relatively high skewness and kurtosis coefficients and low p values of the two tests therein zero precipitation is prevalent and precipitation data can be produced by the climatological infilling method for regions where few gauge stations exist schneider et al 2020 leading to a few unique samples as a result data transformation and normality tests are impacted adding to the spatial plots in figs 10 and 11 boxplots are produced by pooling the normality indicators around the world to compare the normality for original and transformed precipitation data in fig 12 in addition the skewness and kurtosis coefficients are calculated for 1 000 sets of random standard gaussian samples in order to derive the corresponding 2 5 97 5 uncertainty intervals that serve as the references in other words the skewness and kurtosis coefficients tend to fall within the uncertainty intervals when data follow the standard gaussian distribution for the two tests the p values greater than the significance level of 0 05 indicate the normality of data from figs 12a and 12b it can be observed that the skewness and kurtosis coefficients of the transformed data which are generally within the uncertainty intervals are evidently lower than those of the original data from figs 12c and 12d it can be seen that although the popular kolmogorov smirnov test suggests that monthly precipitation data could be normal the shapiro wilk test indicates the generally non gaussian distribution the different outcomes can be due to that the kolmogorov smirnov test require large sample sizes usually more than 100 to facilitate a robust result and that the shapiro wilk test exhibits better power in detecting the departures from the normality in cases with small sample sizes razali et al 2011 nevertheless as shown by the p values under both kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk tests the three transformations are effective in improving the normality of precipitation data 6 discussion this paper has furthermore devised experiments to compare the proposed newton type method with the classical nelder mead method barati 2011 gao han 2012 durgut ayvaz 2023 specifically the case studies in figs 7 to 9 are performed to test the convergence of the nelder mead method the convergence curves for the log box cox and log sinh transformations are presented in the supplementary material in figures s1 to s3 the brown lines in general indicate that the nelder mead method tends to be trapped by local optimal although the global optimal can be reached under some starts more iterations are in demand for example the case of the log sinh transformation shows that the number of iterations can be more than 400 for the nelder mead method figure s3 but mostly less than 100 for the newton type method fig 9 in the meantime the slopes of the curves imply that the nelder mead method usually exhibits a slower rate of reduction for the negative likelihood function this result suggests that the nelder mead method tends to exhibit a slower rate of convergence than the newton type method does it is possibly owing to the fact that the gradient vector and hessian matrix are considered in the proposed newton type method to facilitate the search of global optimal the robustness and efficiency are two of the most important properties of an algorithm nocedal wright 2006 kavetski et al 2018 specifically the robustness indicates the ability to find the global optimal on a wide variety of conditions while the efficiency indicates that there is no need for excessive computational cost nocedal wright 2006 the family of gradient based optimizers to which the newton type method belongs has previously been used for parameter estimation in hydrological and environmental modeling doherty 2003 arnold et al 2012 qin et al 2018 in this paper the newton type method determines the searching direction in each iteration by using the analytical form of gradient vectors derived from the likelihood functions eqs 27 and 28 in this way the newton type method exploits the curvature information for fast convergence rate and reduced computational cost while the newton type method is inevitably subject to local optimal grid based starts devised in the algorithm are effective in facilitating the convergence to the global optimal tolson shoemaker 2007 kavetski clark 2010 furthermore from figs 6 to 9 10 grid based starts for each parameter are shown to be both robust and efficient in leading to the global optimal transformation parameters there are wide uses of the log box cox and log sinh transformations for the normalization of hydroclimatic variables including precipitation and streamflow erdin et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 woldemeskel et al 2018 mcinerney et al 2019 jiang et al 2021 the newton type algorithm proposed in this paper facilitates the comprehensive implementation of the three transformations for data normalization figs 10 to 12 it is noted that the gaussian distribution is an integral component of popular models including bayesian model averaging kriging methods and autoregressive model ma et al 2018 pulkkinen et al 2019 bunn et al 2022 in this case the three transformations implemented by the proposed algorithm can serve for the purpose of data normalization which allows the use of these well established models based on the gaussian distribution for precipitation data specifically statistical models can be formulated for the transformed precipitation data that follow the gaussian distribution and the outcomes are then back transformed into the original space of precipitation wang et al 2009 zhang ye 2021 furthermore the improvement of normality can contribute to reducing the errors caused by possible departures from the gaussian distribution erdin et al 2012 cecinati et al 2017 7 conclusions this paper has proposed a newton type algorithm for the comprehensive implementation of the log box cox and log sinh transformations focusing on the skewness and censoring characteristics of precipitation data the likelihood functions are formulated by relating the z score to the jacobian determinant and then the gradient vectors are analytically derived from the likelihood functions under the three transformations numerical experiments of the gpcc monthly precipitation data are devised to yield diagnostic insights into the efficiency and convergence of the algorithm and investigate its usefulness in data normalization overall the results show that the three transformations are effectively implemented specifically the log transformation robustly reduces positive skewness by using a relatively simple offset parameter the box cox transformation has a flexible form for data normalization but incurs slightly high computational costs to find the global optimal and the log sinh transformation is computational efficient in normalizing precipitation data for the three transformations multiple starts are in demand to deal with local optimal and to reach the global optimal specifically 10 grid based starts for each parameter are shown to be sufficient for the algorithm to find the global optimal overall the three transformations implemented by the newton type algorithm is demonstrated to substantially improve the normality of precipitation data across the world in the future the newton type algorithm can be applied to handle precipitation data at different spatiotemporal scales and in the meantime its robustness and efficiency can be tested 8 plain language summary precipitation is one of the most important hydroclimatic variables that have widespread socioeconomic impacts real world precipitation data usually have a large proportion of small values and a small proportion of extreme values i e skewness and furthermore they have a lower bound at zero i e censoring in hydrological applications the log box cox and log sinh transformations have been widely used for the normalization of precipitation data focusing on the characteristics of skewness and censoring this paper has developed a novel newton type algorithm for the comprehensive implementation of the three transformations specifically the algorithm is developed by formulating the likelihood functions under the three transformations by deriving the gradient vectors to determine the searching directions and by devising grid based starts to facilitate the convergence to the global optimal a test is conducted for precipitation data provided by the global precipitation climatology centre the results show that although precipitation data exhibit varying skewness and censoring characteristics across the globe the three transformations implemented by the newton type algorithm are effective in reducing the skewness handling the censoring and improving the normality overall the newton type algorithm can serve as a useful tool to implement the log box cox and log sinh transformations for hydrological applications credit authorship contribution statement zeqing huang visualization investigation tongtiegang zhao
